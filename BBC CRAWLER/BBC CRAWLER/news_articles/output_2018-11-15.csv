May: I am going to see this through,"This video can not be played Theresa May asked about no-confidence vote: ""Am I going to see this through? Yes."" Theresa May has dismissed speculation she could be ousted as prime minister over her Brexit agreement, saying: ""I am going to see this through."" Despite a series of ministers resigning and talk of a no-confidence vote, she vowed to get the deal signed off in Brussels and to put it to MPs. ""The course I have set out is the right one for our country,"" she said. The BBC understands Michael Gove has rejected Mrs May's offer to become the new Brexit secretary. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said Environment Secretary Mr Gove had said he might accept - if he could try to make changes to the negotiated deal. Sources said Mrs May made it clear that was not possible. He is now considering his position and contemplating resignation. Other sources have told the BBC a wider group of ministers were discussing whether to try to force the PM to seek changes to the deal. Earlier, Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab and Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey both quit in protest at the withdrawal agreement, along with two junior ministers. And leading backbench Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg submitted a letter of no confidence in Mrs May to Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the Tories' backbench 1922 Committee. Live: Theresa May defends Brexit deal No Brexit renegotiation, EU leaders warn Raab quits over 'flawed' Brexit agreement Guide: Rules for any challenge to Theresa May A vote will be triggered if 48 Tory MPs write letters to Sir Graham - it is understood 48 letters have not yet been received. Mrs May spent nearly three hours fielding largely critical questions from MPs before holding a press conference in Downing Street to further answer her critics. This video can not be played ""Negotiations give away on all key points"": Jacob Rees-Mogg on the PM's draft Brexit deal She acknowledged the agreement negotiated with the EU had entailed ""difficult and sometimes uncomfortable decisions"". ""I understand fully that there are some who are unhappy with those compromises but this deal delivers what people voted for and it is in the national interest,"" she said. ""We can only secure it, if we unite behind the agreement reached in cabinet yesterday. ""If we do not move forward with that agreement, nobody can know for sure the consequences that will follow. ""It will be to take a path of deep and grave uncertainty when the British people just want us to get on with it. They are looking to the Conservative Party to deliver."" Reality Check: What does the draft withdrawal agreement reveal? Asked if she would carry on as prime minister if she won a no-confidence vote by a single vote, Mrs May said: ""Leadership is about taking the right decisions, not the easy ones."" She said her job was to ""bring back a deal that delivers on the vote of the British people"". She added: ""I believe this is a deal which does deliver that, which is in the national interest and am I going to see this through? Yes."" This video can not be played How the Conservative Party handles a leadership challenge The prime minister, a cricket fan, was asked if she would ""resign as captain"", but told journalists Geoffrey Boycott, famed for his batting marathons, was one of her sporting heroes: ""And what do you know about Geoffrey Boycott? Geoffrey Boycott stuck to it and he got the runs in the end."" Amid suggestions she was struggling to fill the two cabinet posts vacated by Dominic Raab and Esther McVey earlier on Thursday, she joked: ""I have had, actually, rather a busy day."" The BBC understands that Environment Secretary Michael Gove had been offered the job as Brexit Secretary but had asked for assurances that he could pursue a different kind of deal. Mrs May said Mr Gove was doing ""an excellent job at Defra"" adding: ""I haven't appointed a new Dexeu [Department for Exiting the European Union] secretary yet and I will be making appointments to the government in due course."" By BBC Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg The government, for today at least, is at the mercy of events not in control. Theresa May's vow to stay does not make her deep, deep problems disappear. With her party in revolt, her colleagues departing - some determined to usher her out of office - we can't, and don't know yet, if Brexit can happen as planned, perhaps, if at all. This could be a gale that's weathered in a few days, or a serious storm that sweeps the government away. Read Laura's blog Meanwhile German Chancellor Angela Merkel said there was no appetite for further talks on possible amendments to the current agreement: ""We have a document on the table that Britain and the EU 27 have agreed to, so for me there is no question at the moment whether we negotiate further."" Despite a warning from Tory backbencher Mark Francois earlier that it would be ""mathematically impossible to get this deal through the House of Commons"", Mrs May said she believed, ultimately, her MPs would back it. ""I'm committed, as prime minister, to bringing the best deal back to the UK. I think MPs across my party who look at that deal will recognise the importance of delivering on the vote of the British people and recognise the importance of doing that in a way that does protect people's jobs, protect security and protect the unity of our United Kingdom."" This video can not be played BBC's Laura Kuenssberg asks the PM if she ""in office, but not really in power?"" But Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable suggested the prime minister was ""in denial"": ""The facts haven't changed. There is no majority in Parliament for her deal, and she has rightly conceded that ""No Brexit"" is the real alternative to it."" He said it strengthened the case for another referendum ""to break the deadlock and get the country out of this mess"". Earlier Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn described the deal negotiated with the EU as ""half-baked"" and urged her to withdraw it. He told MPs: ""This is not the deal the country was promised and Parliament cannot - and I believe will not - accept a false choice between this bad deal and no deal."" But Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley defended the prime minister, saying ""there is no better person to do this job"". She said collective responsibility meant that ministers who could not support the deal were required to resign, but added: ""The majority of the cabinet is behind it. The remaining members of the cabinet are absolutely behind this deal and what we need to do now is get behind the prime minister and get that deal sorted in the November (European) Council.""

May defiant as Gove considers quitting,"This video can not be played Theresa May responds to call to stand aside Leading Brexiteers in the cabinet have rallied behind Theresa May amid attempts to unseat her by Tory MPs. Michael Gove said he ""absolutely"" had confidence in Mrs May as he confirmed he would not be following several other ministers out of the door. And Liam Fox urged MPs to support the PM's draft Brexit agreement, saying a ""deal was better than no deal"". The PM has named health minister Steve Barclay as her new Brexit Secretary following Dominic Raab's exit. The 46-year old former banking executive backed Leave in the 2016 referendum and has never rebelled against the Tory whip during his eight years in the Parliament. A mini-reshuffle has also seen Amber Rudd confirmed as the new work and pensions secretary after Esther McVey's resignation on Thursday. The BBC understands Leader of the House Andrea Leadsom could oversee a meeting over the weekend of pro-Brexit cabinet members who have concerns about the deal. Mr Gove and Mr Fox are expected be present, along with International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt and Transport Secretary Chris Grayling. The news came as more Conservatives expressed unhappiness with Mrs May's leadership and urged a confidence vote. The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said about 20 Tories have, so far, publicly stated they have submitted letters of no confidence in the PM over her handling of Brexit. This is some way short of the 48 needed to trigger a vote under Conservative Party rules. Live: Theresa May vows to sell Brexit deal Rudd back in cabinet at work and pensions Who has written no confidence letters? Reality Check: What do May's Tory enemies object to? Pound steadies after worse day since 2016 One of those to do so, ex-minister Mark Francois, said the draft agreement negotiated by Mrs May with the EU was ""truly awful"" and the prime minister ""just doesn't listen"" to concerns within her party. Ex-Brexit minister Steve Baker told the BBC's Politics Live that although he could not be sure of the number of letters submitted, he believed it was ""close"" to 48 and a contest was ""imminent"". If this happened, he suggested the European Research Group of Brexiteer Tory MPs, headed by Jacob Rees-Mogg, would ""collectively agree"" which single candidate was best-placed to deliver the Brexit they wanted and back them. But Cabinet Office minister David Lidington said Mrs May would win any contest ""decisively"" and ""deserved to"" since there was ""no plausible alternative"" to her approach. Rumours had been rife that Mr Gove, a key figure in the 2016 Leave campaign, would follow fellow Brexiteers out of the cabinet in protest at the EU withdrawal agreement. This video can not be played Steve Baker: ""It's a grave matter but I think we we are close"" But the environment secretary, who reportedly rejected an offer to make him Brexit secretary after Dominic Raab's exit, told reporters on Friday he was focused on working in cabinet to get ""the right deal in the future"". Asked if he had confidence in the PM, Mr Gove said: ""I absolutely do."" He added: ""I'm also looking forward to continuing to work with all my government colleagues and all my colleagues in parliament in order to make sure that we get the best future for Britain."" International Trade Secretary Liam Fox told an event in Bristol: ""We are not elected to do what we want to do, but to do what is in the national interest."" Speaking in public for the first time since the withdrawal agreement was signed off by cabinet, Mr Fox said he hopes MPs ""will take a rational and reasonable view"" of the deal. He added: ""I hope across parliament we recognise that a deal is better than no deal, and businesses require certainty - it's in our national interest to provide certainty as soon as possible."" By BBC Assistant Political Editor Norman Smith This video can not be played How the Conservative Party handles a leadership challenge Michael Gove is not resigning because he thinks that even at this very late hour, he is the person who can make Theresa May change course with Brexit. This is a huge relief for Theresa May, who meanwhile has been carrying on with business as usual by trying to sell her deal. Theresa May has made it absolutely clear that she is going nowhere. Senior placed Tory MPs are saying they have reached the magic 48 letters needed for a vote of confidence against Theresa May, but Sir Graham Brady - chairman of the 1922 committee - is giving precious little away. A Conservative party leadership challenge is most definitely looming, if not this morning or this afternoon, by the weekend. Michael Gove is a bit of a man of mystery, but if he doesn't take the Brexit Secretary role, it begs the question of who would take that job. How could May turmoil affect Brexit? Can May get Brexit deal through Commons? Brexit Q&A: Your questions answered Mr Gove's decision to stay was a boost for Mrs May, who followed up a defiant Downing Street press conference on Thursday with a live phone-in on Friday morning on LBC radio, during which two callers said she should stand aside.

Ex-Culture Secretary John Whittingdale is among the latest Tory MP to demand a vote of confidence in the PM while a number of MPs, including Mr Francois and Adam Holloway, publicly tweeted copies of their letter.

Ambassadors from EU member states also met in Brussels on Friday morning to discuss the agreement. The bloc's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, paid tribute to Mrs May, but said that the EU had to protect its principles even if there were political problems in the UK. BBC Brussels reporter Adam Fleming said the consensus from the meeting was that the EU should keep calm and not provoke the situation in the UK. The government unveiled its long-awaited draft withdrawal agreement on Wednesday, which sets out the terms of the UK's departure from the EU, over 585 pages. But Mrs May is facing opposition from across the political spectrum to the draft deal, which must be approved by Parliament, with critics saying it will leave the UK indefinitely tied to the EU. It is also understood,externalthat a group of cabinet ministers are also considering whether to try to force Mrs May to make some changes to the withdrawal deal.

She fights on. More than two years since the vote to leave the European Union we do know the kind of relationship that the country could build with the rest of the continent after Brexit. We do know the prime minister has every intention of staying on to push it through. But we don't know whether it's politically possible, whether it could get through Parliament. Live: May defends Bexit deal May: I am going to see this through We don't know who the person in charge of the process will be - the Brexit secretary. And, most glaringly, we actually don't know if the prime minister will still be in place to try to push her deal through. The government, for today at least, is at the mercy of events not in control. Her vow to stay on tonight does not make her deep, deep problems disappear. With her party in revolt, her colleagues departing - some determined to usher her out of office - we can't, and don't know yet, if Brexit can happen as planned, perhaps, if at all. This could be a gale that's weathered in a few days, or a serious storm that sweeps the government away. But while the prime minister's future is so uncertain, so is all of ours.

BBC experts answer some of the most common questions you have sent us. Is there time for a renegotiation?@LonsYons Chris Morris, Reality Check correspondent replies: It would be difficult but not impossible: the rest of the EU would have to agree an extension of Article 50 - which they are not keen on. What is the chance of an European Economic Area (EEA)-European Free Trade Association (EFTA) deal?George Cazenove Chris Morris, Reality Check correspondent replies: Trouble with this is that no-one has really asked Norway and co if they really want the UK to crash their party. It sounds like a simple solution, but would actually be very complex. Then again, which proposal isn't? This video can not be played Brexit agreement: What does the 585-page document say? What is the likelihood of this deal being approved by all 27 other EU members?James Blackford Chris Morris, Reality Check correspondent replies: I think the other 27 would say yes if they thought the UK was committed to it. They've got plenty of other things to worry about other than Brexit. They want it sorted one way or another Live coverage: Theresa May and Brexit latest What does the draft withdrawal agreement reveal? Brexit: A guide to where we are What will it mean for British citizens' freedom of travel and rights to live & work on the continent?Henry Covey Daniel Sandford, Home affairs correspondent replies: The headline is freedom of movement ends after the transition period finishes in December 2020, but until then British citizens and their families will continue to have the right to move to live and work in the EU, and vice versa. Those who take up residence before the end of the transition period will be allowed to remain beyond transition and, if they stay for five years, will be allowed to remain permanently. However, once the transition period is over, the draft agreement does allow the EU to require UK citizens who stay on to apply for a new residence document. Will the UK be free to make trade deals with other countries?Peter Hodge Andrew Walker, Economics correspondent replies: The full answer is complicated. The short answer is: it looks like it would be difficult. First let's suppose we do end up activating the Northern Ireland backstop. That involves what the draft agreement calls a Single Customs Territory for the UK and the EU, which appears to be a customs union in all but name. In particular it says: ""Under no circumstances may the United Kingdom apply to its customs territory a customs tariff which is lower than the Common Customs Tariff (applied by the EU) for any good or import from any third country."" That rules out the bread and butter of trade agreements, negotiating the reduction or elimination of tariffs. It might still be possible to do deals on services and also investment, which is an area that has often been added on to trade agreements. If the backstop is not activated, then it depends on the shape of the agreement on the long-term relationship, which would be negotiated during the transition period. We have an outline of the political declaration intended to guide those negotiations, which says the ultimate deal should ""build on the single customs territory provided for in the Withdrawal Agreement"". On the face of it, that could run into the same difficulties as the backstop in terms of trade deals with other countries. If, however, it drops the prohibition on applying tariffs lower than the EU's, we would be in a position to negotiate conventional trade agreements with other countries. Please upgrade your browser What does the deal say about services, specifically regulations on UK financial services? Is there equivalence?Schwitt, London Andrew Walker, Economics correspondent replies: This is a question for the long term rather than the Withdrawal Agreement.  The outline political declaration doesn't make a general commitment that there will be equivalence granted but it does refer to it. The EU and UK can take ""equivalence decisions in their own interest"". The document calls for assessments of equivalence to start as soon as possible after Brexit and be completed by the end of the transition period. But I would emphasise this. It is just an outline to guide negotiations, not a definitive statement of where they will end. I am a UK national, living and studying within the EU, what impact would this have on me?Paul Blow, studying in Venlo in the Netherlands Sean Coughlan, Education correspondent replies: The future status of UK students in the EU and EU students in the UK still remains uncertain. Up to 2020, and during the transition period, not much would be expected to change. But the longer-term arrangements, about levels of tuition fees and access to student loans, have still to be decided. At present, EU and UK students are treated the same for fees in each other's countries - which has seen some UK students going to university in low-fee countries such as the Netherlands. But it will have to be negotiated whether there will be any reciprocal deals to replace this. What does the draft withdrawal agreement reveal? Will the EU still have access to UK waters and fish stocks?Stephen Knox Chris Morris, Reality Check correspondent replies: One policy area is excluded from these potential customs arrangements: fishing. That's because the trade-off between access for UK fish produce to EU markets, and access for EU boats to UK waters, is too controversial. The draft agreement simply states that ""the Union and the United Kingdom shall use their best endeavours to conclude and ratify"" an agreement ""on access to waters and fishing opportunities"". This video can not be played When will Brexit happen? Will the European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) continue to have the same validity for UK citizens visiting the EU as is currently does?John Jarvis Hugh Pym, Health Editor replies: UK citizens' rights to get healthcare in the EU and vice versa will be thrashed out during the transition period from March 2019 to December 2020. The Government has drawn up a Bill to spell this out but it wont have any force till the transition talks work out how it will all work.  If there is no deal things get a lot more complicated! The Reality Check team adds: During the transition period all EU law will continue to apply in the UK. That would mean that citizens would have exactly the same rights and guarantees as before - so, you'll still be able to use your card at least until the period ends.

Simon Jack: Three reasons markets have fallenVideoVideoBrexit deal: Is everything decided?,"The markets took a fright today as Theresa May's cabinet - and with it, her Brexit deal - appeared to be falling apart. Markets are a bit like bookmakers, they reflect the odds of certain outcomes, and three things have just become more likely than they were yesterday. Leaving the EU without a deal, a change of Prime Minister and a general election. All three scare investors. Here's why: Leaving the EU without a deal is widely considered bad for the UK economy - at least in the short to medium term - and that is bad for the pound. That hits people's incomes by pushing the price of imported goods and things priced in dollars (like petrol) higher. Cash-strapped consumers may find it harder to pay their loans, credit cards and mortgages, hence the big fall we have seen this morning in the shares of banks and housebuilders. Persimmon is down over 10% and Lloyds by more than 6%. The odds of a general election have just gone up and that means the possibility of a Corbyn government must have increased as well. Markets don't like the prospect of that, because of Labour's intention to raise taxes on companies and nationalise large sections of the economy. As for the day-to-day running of businesses, not a lot has changed this morning, as most companies had little faith that Theresa May's Brexit deal would get through Parliament. That lack of faith seems entirely vindicated by this morning's resignations, which have seen former ministers join the ranks of Labour, the DUP and 40 or so pro-Brexit Conservatives in intending to vote against it. One minister described the five-hour cabinet meeting to me last night as one of the most surreal experiences of his career. The picture of a briefly triumphant PM standing outside Number 10 last night did indeed feel like a dream this morning.

a diplomatic note of a meeting between Michel Barnier and EU27 ambassadors in
Brussels this afternoon. The EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier also said that the
UK is still pushing for a Chequers-style free trade area in goods with a common
rule-book to be included in the political declaration on the future
relationship. There was a divide between member
states that want an ambitious trading relationship with the UK and those who
want Britainâs access to the single market to be more constrained. The UK wants to maintain the
status quo on internal security, which is also âa problem,â ambassadors were
told. The final political declaration
could be between 14 and 20 pages long. Spain raised serious concerns
about Gibraltar, which officials fear could grow in the coming days. Michel Barnier said the political
situation in the UK was âvolatile.â A diplomat said the message from
the EUâs Brexit negotiators to the member states was âkeep a lid on your
concerns for now and weâll deal with them in the negotiations on the future
relationship."". The European Council is also
planning to issue conclusions which will go alongside the withdrawal agreement
and the political declaration when they are endorsed at the special summit next
week. New York Times The New York Times hastaken a quizzical look,externalat how Theresa May could be ousted as prime minister.  In a secret location, the chairman of a panel called the 1922 Committee was collecting poison-pen letters from rebels within Mrs Mayâs Conservative Party, calling for her to be removed as leader.  The number of letters is secret except to the chairman, Graham Brady, but once their number reaches 48, the committee â also known as âthe men in gray suitsâ â can demand a vote of all 315 Conservative members of Parliament. If she doesnât win half the votes, she will be forced to resign.  This is the way political death comes in Britain, speedily and stealthily.""  The Andrew Marr Show Nicola Sturgeon has confirmed her SNP MPs will vote against Theresa May's Brexit deal. The First Minister rejected claims her Westminster MPs could abstain on the vote in the House of Commons. The SNP leader told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show it would be ""deeply irresponsible"" for any MPs to endorse the prime minister's agreement, published last week. And she revealed she will be heading to London to talk to opposition parties about alternatives in the coming days. The SNP has 35 MPs at Westminster. Labour has said it will oppose the draft agreement in the crunch Commons vote, and the DUP - which props up the Tory government in key votes - has also criticised the proposals. Read more More from the DUP's Nigel Dodds, who has described the draft withdrawal deal as ""dangerous"". ""This deal would place a trade border in the Irish Sea, subject us to EU rules without any power to influence or change them and binds us to the EU with no unilateral ability to leave. Indeed, Northern Ireland is part of the EU customs union not the UK's."" Former first secretary of state Damian Green is an ally of Theresa May, so it's no surprise that he is strongly against any challenge to her leadership. If you step back, we are at the absolute crunch point of the most important negotiations this country has had for decades. I think saying that what the country now needs - let alone the Conservative Party, look at it on a national basis - to say that what the country now needs is a leadership election and a change of leadership, is absurd. From the country's point of view, I think that's exactly the wrong way to go.""  The Democratic Unionist Party, whose 10 MPs give Theresa May vital support in key votes, is not happy about the draft agreement, saying it could create a new border down the Irish Sea by making Northern Ireland follow different trade rules to the rest of the UK. Deputy leader Nigel Dodds said: ""I understand why some people fear a 'no deal' scenario. ""But the choice is between this very bad deal and the right
deal. ""With MPs on all sides of the House
pointing to the dangers for the Union of the Withdrawal
Agreement, it is clear that it is time to work for a better deal
which does not undermine the integrity of the United Kingdom.""  Catherine Haddon, of the Institute for Government think
tank, said the 25 November EU summit would probably have to be postponed if May loses a
vote of confidence. She would still be prime minister until a new Tory leader was elected, unless she resigned and handed over to a caretaker PM. âIt would have implications for the negotiations because we
donât know what the position of the new prime minister would be,â Ms Haddon told BBC
News. Appointing a caretaker PM would be âquite problematicâ because
the party is divided and would be unlikely to agree on a suitable candidate. The whole Tory leadership process takes about two months,
although they could shorten it, but they would âhave to say to the EU, and the
public, we will come back in January and try to get through the leadership
contest between now and thenâ. That would take us even closer to the 29 March, the
scheduled departure date, and make it even tighter to get the required Brexit
legislation through Parliament in time. Tory MPs will be conscious of the time pressure and if she
survives this week then the chances of her being ousted are reduced, argued Ms
Haddon. She could face another âpressure pointâ when MPs vote on the
deal, which might lead to another attempt to get her out. If she won a  vote of confidence it would âstrengthen
her hand quite considerably,â she adds. The BBC's Europe editor tweets...  Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Rob WatsonBBC political correspondent This time next week Theresa May hopes to be in Brussels finalising her Brexit plan with EU leaders. In the meantime she's fighting off challenges at home not just to that plan but her very leadership. Her message to hardline Brexiteers within the Conservative Party - getting rid of me won't make Brexit any easier. So far those Brexiteers have yet to muster the numbers against her for a vote of no confidence, though that could come any minute or any day. Whatever happens, whether she survives any leadership challenge or not,  the Conservative party now seems in a state of open civil war over Brexit with unforeseeable consequences for Britain's departure from the EU. The World This WeekendRadio 4 programme John Whittingdale, a former culture secretary, is one of the Conservative MPs who have submitted a letter calling for the prime minister to stand down. ""When you have a succession of resignations of the numbers that we have seen, not just this week, but when the Chequers Agreement was published, it does look like a government in disarray and it's very hard to reach any other conclusion. ""But that is because we are pushing ahead with a deal that commands very little support in the Conservative Party, is opposed in Parliament and certainly on the basis of my discussions with my own constituents, commands virtually no support in the country."" The World This WeekendRadio 4 programme Another Conservative association chair, councillor Tom Ashton of the Boston and Skegness association where people voted overwhelmingly for Brexit, says Mrs May should stay - for now. ""I wouldn't support a leadership challenge at this stage,"" he said. ""I feel she deserves the chance now to bring the deal that she's speaking of before Parliament. ""But if you cannot get a deal through, then I think it'll be up to party colleagues in Parliament 
to consider their options,"" he added. The BBC's Andrew Marr clashes with Baroness Chakrabarti, Labour's shadow attorney general, during a discussion about Brexit. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Reality Check: The agreement,"This video can not be played The Brexit agreement summarised in two minutes The draft withdrawal agreement is all about how the UK leaves the European Union. It's not about any permanent future relationship. It's a long read - 585 pages long,external- and we've just had a first look at the text. There will be plenty more to say in the days ahead. But what's in this draft document, that some people thought might never materialise? Well we've known about a lot of the content for some time. There are details of the financial settlement (often dubbed the divorce bill) that the two sides agreed some months ago: over time, it means the UK will pay at least Â£39bn to the EU to cover all its financial obligations. There's also a long section on citizens' rights after Brexit for EU citizens in the UK and Brits elsewhere in Europe. It maintains their existing residency rights, but big questions remain about a host of issues, including the rights of UK citizens to work across borders elsewhere in the EU. The legal basis for a transition (or implementation) period, beginning after Brexit. It would be 21 months during which the UK would continue to follow all European Union rules (in order to give governments and businesses more time to prepare for long term change). That means that during transition, the UK would remain under the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice (in fact, the ECJ is mentioned more than 60 times in this document). The document says that decisions adopted by European Union institutions during this period ""shall be binding on and in the United Kingdom"". The transition period is also designed to allow time for the UK and the EU to reach a trade deal. The draft agreement says both sides will use their ""best endeavours"" to ensure that a long term trade deal is in place by the end of 2020. Significantly, if more time is needed, the option of extending the transition appears in the document (although, it makes it clear that the UK would have to pay for it). The document doesn't say how long the transition could be extended for (in fact they've left the date blank), only that the Joint Committee may take a decision ""extending the transition period up to [31 December 20XX]."" UK officials hope that the date will be clarified by the time of the proposed EU summit on 25 November. If there was no long term trade agreement and no extension of the transition, that's when the so-called ""backstop"" would kick in. It's the issue that has dominated negotiations for the last few weeks and months: how to ensure that no hard border (with checks or physical infrastructure) emerges after Brexit between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Both sides agreed back in December 2017 that there should be a guarantee to avoid a hard border under all circumstances. That guarantee came to be known as the backstop, but agreeing a legal text proved very difficult. So what exactly does this draft agreement say about the border, the backstop and the legal guarantees that underpin it? If a backstop is needed, it will - as expected - take the form of a temporary customs union encompassing not just Northern Ireland but the whole of the UK. The draft agreement describes this as a ""single customs territory"". Northern Ireland, though, will be in a deeper customs relationship with the EU than Great Britain, and even more closely tied to the rules of the EU single market. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. One policy area is excluded from these potential customs arrangements: fishing. That's because the trade-off between access for UK fish produce to EU markets, and access for EU boats to UK waters, is too controversial. The draft agreement simply states that ""the Union and the United Kingdom shall use their best endeavours to conclude and ratify"" an agreement ""on access to waters and fishing opportunities"". There are also details of one of the last issues to be negotiated - the terms on which the UK may be able to leave this temporary customs arrangement in the future. If either party notifies the other that it wants the backstop to come to an end, a joint ministerial committee will meet within six months to consider the details. But the backstop (which is part of the Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland) would only cease to apply if ""the Union and the United Kingdom decide jointly"" that it is no longer necessary. In other words, the UK will not have a unilateral right to bring those arrangements to an end. For some Brexiteers, that is simply unacceptable. A guide to where we are with Brexit But, don't forget, other countries will also have their concerns. They too will focus on the language surrounding a temporary customs union, to ensure that nothing is hidden there which could, in their view, give the UK rights without responsibilities; and - potentially - a competitive advantage. The EU insists the draft agreement ""includes the corresponding level playing field commitments and appropriate enforcement mechanisms to ensure fair competition between the EU27 and the UK."" So, it's not just in London that this document will be closely scrutinised. Finally one big question: to what extent could these temporary customs arrangements form the basis for a permanent future relationship, which can only be negotiated formally after Brexit has actually happened?

"No Brexit renegotiation, EU warns","Mrs Merkel said talks to amend the draft agreement were unlikely as a deal was ""on the table"" EU leaders have dismissed talk of renegotiating the draft Brexit deal and warned the UK's political situation could make a ""no-deal"" more likely. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said there was ""no question"" of reopening talks as a document was ""on the table"". Meanwhile French PM Edouard Philippe said there was a need to prepare for a no-deal because of UK ""uncertainty"". The EU has set out a series of meetings leading up to 25 November when it plans to approve the Brexit agreement. However leaders admit that there is still much ground to cover after the UK Prime Minister Theresa May won backing on Wednesday from her cabinet for the 585-page draft agreement. ""We still have a long road ahead of us on both sides,"" the EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said. LIVE: Follow the Brexit story Brexit: A guide to where we are Watch: What is Brexit? On Thursday, Mrs Merkel said she was pleased that progress had been made. But following news ofresignations from Mrs May's cabinet, including the UK's Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab, she said it was possible that Britain may still leave without a deal. She also said that there was no appetite for further talks on possible amendments to the current agreement. ""We have a document on the table that Britain and the EU 27 have agreed to, so for me there is no question at the moment whether we negotiate further,"" she said. Mr Philippe appeared to echo her sentiment over UK political uncertainty. ""It will escape no-one that the current political situation in Britain could fuel uncertainty... over the ratification of the accord,"" he said. The European Parliament's Brexit chief Guy Verhofstadt said the deal had been hammered out after two years of ""intense negotiations"" and he hoped UK MPs would accept that ""there is not a lot of room [for] manoeuvre to say, 'OK, let's start again'"". French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said the deal was ""good news for the French economy"" but also issued caution, saying the UK must be made to respect all EU rules. Analysis by BBC Europe editor, Katya Adler The EU knows there is a very real possibility the Brexit deal could be voted down by the UK Parliament in a few weeks' time. I put the question to Michel Barnier on Wednesday night at his press conference - but, skilled politician that he is, he refused to engage. Brussels is very keen indeed not to give the impression that the EU might change or come up with a ""better"" Brexit deal text if this one ends up being rejected in the House of Commons. Mr Barnier quoted Theresa May as saying that this is a deal in the UK's interest. Read more from Katya Finland's Prime Minister Juha Sipila tweeted to say that while Wednesday's developments were important, ""decisions on both sides are still needed for a final agreement"". Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said he was ""very pleased"" and ""optimistic"", adding: ""We are pinning our hopes on it."" Speaking on Thursday alongside EU Council head Donald Tusk, Mr Barnier said the agreement was fair and balanced, took into account the UK's needs and laid the ground for an ""ambitious new partnership"". Mr Barnier (L) formally hands the agreement to European Council head Donald Tusk Mr Tusk praised Mr Barnier's work and said the agreement had ""secured the interests of the 27 member states and EU as a whole"". He laid out the timetable for the days ahead. EU member states will analyse the document and at the end of the week national envoys will share their assessments A political declaration on future ties between the EU and the UK will be agreed by Tuesday and members will have 48 hours to evaluate it The EU Council will then meet for a summit on 25 November to finalise the agreement ""if nothing extraordinary happens"", Mr Tusk said. The leaders of the 27 EU nations must approve the deal Mr Tusk said: ""Since the very beginning, we have had no doubt that Brexit is a lose-lose situation, and that our negotiations are only about damage control."" Addressing the UK, he added: ""As much as I am sad to see you leave, I will do everything to make this farewell the least painful possible, for you and for us."" Pound dives after Brexit resignations Mr Barnier later took the document to the European Parliament. Its president, Antonio Tajani, said MEPs would vote on the deal in early 2019. If the agreement is approved by both sides, a 21-month transition period will kick in, during which a trade deal and the thorny issue of how to ensure there is no physical border between Northern Ireland - part of the UK - and the Republic of Ireland will need to be worked out. A smooth border-free exchange underpins the peace deal that ended the Northern Ireland conflict. Brexit debate dominates Sunday interviews What is Brexit? VideoWhat is Brexit? Brexit and immigration.

'PM has broken promises' - DUP,"This video can not be played Nigel Dodds accused Theresa May of ignoring promises she made to the DUP about Northern Ireland over the Brexit deal Parliament has a ""clear choice"" to stand up for the UK against a draft Brexit deal or allow it to break up the union and make the UK a ""vassal"" state, DUP MP Nigel Dodds has said.

Several cabinet ministers have resigned, saying the deal presents a threat to the integrity of the union. Mr Dodds was among MPs criticising the prime minister in the House of Commons amid a backlash over her plan. The DUP's 10 MPs prop up the Conservative government to ensure it has a majority to pass key legislation in the Commons. Mr Dodds said he could take Mrs May through the list of promises she made about the future of Northern Ireland but that would be a ""waste of time because she clearly doesn't listen"". He put it to MPs: ""The choice is now clear, we stand up for the United Kingdom, the whole of the United Kingdom, the integrity of the United Kingdom or we vote for a vassal state with the break-up of the UK."" But the prime minister said it was wrong to imply that she had not considered the interests of the people of Northern Ireland. The real spat among politicians is over the UK and EU's agreement on the Northern Ireland backstop. It would see Northern Ireland staying aligned to some rules of the EU single market, if another solution cannot be found by the end of the transition period in December 2020. That means that goods coming into Northern Ireland would need to be checked to see if they meet EU standards. It would also involve a temporary single custom territory effectively keeping the whole of the UK in the EU customs union - until both the EU and UK agree that it is no longer necessary. Mrs May has said there was no deal on the table that did not involve signing up to the backstop - but that it is only an insurance policy. Allow Twitter content?

European media: Hurdles ahead,"Cabinet approval of the Brexit deal gains huge attention in the European newspapers, many of which went to press before Thursday morning's resignations from the British government. While most applaud Theresa May for securing her ministers' backing in the teeth of fierce argument, many newspapers anticipated the latest events by saying significant obstacles still barred her way forward. ""So the Brexit deal is over the line?"" asks theIrish Examiner,external. ""You must be joking. Everything relies on what happens in Britain and Northern Ireland, meaning the white smoke from Downing Street last night could just as easily be found tomorrow to be muffling, blinding fog."" The Irish Times says the UK ""will be worse off and will have less significant clout and influence"" The Irish Times,externaldeclares that Theresa May has ""taken the leap"". It says that the difficulty for her is that wherever this ends up, ""the UK will be worse off and will have less significant clout and influence. But that, unfortunately, is the inevitability of Brexit"". The prime minister ""wrested a deal from the EU and laboriously channelled it through her cabinet"", says Germany's left-liberal weeklyDer Spiegel,external, under the headline ""Another near escape."" ""It could have been worse for Theresa May. But the biggest hurdle is still ahead for the British prime minister,"" it says. That thought is echoed in centre-right dailyDie Welt,external, which warns that despite cabinet backing, the divorce deal ""is still at risk"". Resistance in both the Conservative Party and Parliament is enormous, the paper says, under the headline ""The real Brexit hurdle for Theresa May is yet to come.""

Pound and UK shares hit by Brexit turmoilSterling falls more than 1.7% and shares in UK banks and housebuilders slump.,"The pound and shares in housebuilders and banks have fallen sharply after cabinet ministers Dominic Raab and Esther McVey quit over Prime Minister Theresa May's draft Brexit deal. Royal Bank of Scotland sank 9%, with 7% falls for Persimmon, Taylor Wimpey and Barratt Developments. Sterling fell 1.7% against the dollar and 1.9% against the euro. The FTSE 100 index closed little moved, but the FTSE 250, which mainly comprises UK-focused firms, fell 1.6%. Capita topped the fallers in the FTSE 250, plunging 14%, with Countryside Properties down 9%. Shares in companies that do most or all of their business in the UK reflected the continued political uncertainty, as members of the Conservative Party and opposition politicians voiced their scepticism over the draft deal. ""The market has taken a big red pen to stocks which are heavily exposed to the UK economy like the banks, retailers and housebuilders,"" said Laith Khalaf at Hargreaves Lansdown. ""These sectors were already under pressure, but the potential for an orderly Brexit to unravel in the next few days is causing further distress to be manifested in share prices."" BBC business editor Simon Jack said:""The odds of a general election have just gone up and that means the possibility of a Corbyn government must have increased as well. ""Markets don't like the prospect of that because of Labour's intention to raise taxes on companies and nationalise large sections of the economy."" The higher chances of an election was one of the reasons behind RBS' steep fall, as the Labour Party has said it would nationalise the lender. However, shares in other banks also fell, as investors considered the threat to the economy and therefore to banks' balance sheets if the UK were to leave the EU without a deal. Sterling ended the day in London at under $1.28 against the dollar after a turbulent day's trading. Initially on Wednesday, when Theresa May announced she had secured cabinet backing for the draft Brexit agreement with Brussels, the pound recovered earlier lost ground. But by Thursday morning it was already wavering. A string of ministerial resignations led by Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab and Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey, undermined confidence in the pound further as market observers deemed the chances of a disorderly Brexit had risen. The Brexit process has been punctuated by big movements in the pound's relationship with the dollar, something which can lead to big gains or losses for investors. In the run-up to, and immediate aftermath of the Brexit referendum on 23 June 2016, for example, the pound hit a peak of volatility against the dollar. And as the graphic below shows, the events surrounding Wednesday's draft agreement has triggered the greatest volatility for sterling since the referendum. Jane Foley at Rabobank said the pound's plunge was ""firmly tied"" to the perception that Mrs May will have difficulty in pushing the Brexit plan through Parliament. She said the resignations had increased speculation that the prime minister would face a no-confidence vote, something that would weigh heavily on the pound: ""Any turn of events that could raise the risk of a general election would also punish the pound, given the risk of a market-unfriendly far-left government."" Chris Turner at ING said Mr Raab's resignation had increased the chances of a leadership challenge and a no-deal Brexit. He said the pound ""could fall another 3-4% unless the threat of a leadership election is quashed or there are clearer signs that the withdrawal agreement can garner more support in parliament"". Organisations that speak on behalf of business like the Confederation of British Industry welcomed the draft deal, because it offered the prospect of a smooth path towards Brexit. The CBI described the agreement as a ""compromise, including for business"" but was happy that it represented a ""step back from the cliff-edge"". The agreement includes a 21-month transition period, during which time the UK will negotiate new trade terms with the EU. The UK would have a unilateral right to extend that transition period, which was described as ""very positive for business"" by James Stewart, head of Brexit at KPMG. Northern Ireland also has the guarantee of a ""friction-free"" customs border with the Republic of Ireland. CBI Director-general Carolyn Fairbairn told the BBC: ""There is a possible path to frictionless trade now in terms of negotiating the final deal. I don't think anyone thinks the transition or the backstop is the answer, so this has to be used as a route to a final deal with frictionless trade and access for services."" Of course not. Pro-Brexit economist Gerard Lyons, chief economic strategist at Netwealth Investment and former chief economic adviser to Boris Johnson while he was Mayor of London, says the draft withdrawal deal is not something to cheer about. ""Whilst it has avoided the cliff edge, I think it's important we don't bury our heads in the sands here and view this as a 'good' deal - this is still disappointing,"" he said. Those who had hoped the draft deal would supply some reassurance will also be disappointed as Theresa May wrestles with critics and struggles to unite enough MPs behind her plan.

School bans designer coats,"Several brands including Canada Goose are covered by the ban A school in Merseyside has banned pupils from wearing expensive designer coats in a bid to stop ""poverty-shaming"" among its students. In a letter to parents, Woodchurch High School in Birkenhead said pupils would not be allowed to wear branded coats such as Moncler, Pyrenex and Canada Goose. Head teacher Rebekah Phillips said pupils and parents supported the move. However, some people on Twitter have called the ban ""absolutely ridiculous"". The labels banned by the school include children's sizes which sell for between Â£400 and Â£1,000. The ban will be introduced after the Christmas holidays. Mrs Phillips said: ""We are very concerned as a school about poverty-proofing our school environment and, as such, we met with groups of pupils and made the decision in consultation with them. ""The pupils spoke to us about the pressure on families and the pressure on themselves to wear particular branded coats. A few years ago we introduced a school bag for the same reason. ""We have had parents approaching us asking us to introduce a ban prior to us writing the letter."" Moncler quilted jackets were created for mountaineers and skiers in the Alps There has been a mixed reaction on social media with people writing both in support and against the school's designer label ban. One Twitter user wrote: ""Absolutely ridiculous, banning those coats. It's a fact of life that there are poor kids, get over it.""

Roma pays towards injured fan's care,"Sean Cox is receiving treatment in the National Rehabilitation Centre in Dun Laoghaire. Roma football club is to donate â¬150,000 (Â£133,000) towards the medical and rehabilitation costs of a fan who was attacked in Liverpool. Sean Cox, 53, from Ireland, suffered a brain injury before a match between Liverpool and Roma in April. The club said officials had visited Mr Cox and his wife and would work with them on initiatives to help cover care costs ""over a multi-year period"". Martina Cox said her husband ""will require care for the rest of his life"". The father-of-three, from Dunboyne, Co Meath, was attacked outside Anfield on 24 April before the first leg of Liverpool's Champion League semi-final. He is receiving treatment in the National Rehabilitation Centre in Dun Laoghaire, County Dublin. Roma said it would donate â¬100,000 and chairman Jim Pallotta will make a personal donation of â¬50,000. Mr Pallotta said: ""What happened to Sean Cox should never happen to anyone attending a football match. ""Our thoughts today, as they have been from day one, are with Sean, Martina and their whole family. ""We all hope Sean makes as full a recovery as possible."" Mrs Cox said: ""Our life has been turned upside down by what has happened to Sean. ""There is no sign of Sean being able to return home any time soon and even with extensive specialist rehabilitation efforts, which will take years, he will require care for the rest of his life."" Jurgen Klopp earlier donated 5,000 euros towards Mr Cox's treatment Liverpool FC manager Jurgen Klopp has donated 5,000 euros (Â£4,400) towards Mr Cox's long-term care. In October, Roma fan Filippo Lombardi, 21, was cleared of being part of a joint attack on Mr Cox, but admitted violent disorder. During the trial, Mr Cox's brother Martin said his brother could not speak or sit up unaided following the attack. The court heard another man had been arrested in Rome in connection with the attack and was awaiting extradition.

NHS bosses look to overhaul cancer screening,"Cancer screening programmes are to be reviewed following high-profile mistakes that have put thousands of patients in England at risk. NHS England has asked former government cancer tsar Sir Mike Richards to look at what changes are needed. Three national schemes cover breast, cervical and bowel cancers. On Wednesday, it emerged letters about the cervical cancer tests that should have gone to 40,000 women between January and June had not been sent. About 4,000 of them were results of tests, the remainder were letters inviting them for screening or reminding them tests were due. Between 150 and 200 of the test results that were not sent out detailed abnormal results. NHS bosses have been able to contact all those affected. Cervical screening hit by 'appalling' blunder Millions of women miss out on smear tests Breast scan error 'shortened up to 270 lives' The service in charge of distributing letters is provided for NHS England by Capita. Looking at the merits of outsourcing screening was going to form part of the review, NHS England said. The problems come just months after it emerged 174,000 women had not been invited for breast cancer screening, after mistakes had gone undetected for years. That service was not outsourced. Sir Mike has also been asked to look at whether the programmes are making sufficient use of technology and whether the age ranges for the types of screening being offered is right. ""There is no doubt that screening programmes save thousands of lives every year,"" he said. ""However, as part of implementing the NHS's long term plan, we want to make certain they are as effective as possible."" The results of the review are expected by the summer of next year.

Saudis identify 'Khashoggi's killer',"This video can not be played Jamal Khashoggi: What we know about the journalist's disappearance and death Saudi Arabia's public prosecutor has concluded that an intelligence officer ordered Jamal Khashoggi's murder, and not Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. The officer was tasked with persuading the dissident journalist to return to the Gulf kingdom, a spokesman said. Khashoggi was given a lethal injection after a struggle in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on 2 October, he added. The public prosecutor has charged 11 people over the murder,externaland is seeking the death penalty for five of them. Their cases have been referred to a court while investigations into another 10 people suspected of involvement continue. The US treasury department later imposed economic sanctions on 17 Saudi officials who it said had ""targeted and brutally killed"" Khashoggi,external, who lived and worked in the US, and had to ""face consequences for their actions"". This video can not be played The Saudi foreign minister blamed ""rogue individuals"" They included Saud al-Qahtani, a former adviser to the crown prince who the treasury department alleged was ""part of the planning and execution of the operation"" that led to Khashoggi's murder; Maher Mutreb, who it said had ""co-ordinated and executed"" the operation; and Mohammed Alotaibi, the Istanbul consul-general. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the sanctions were ""an important step in responding to Khashoggi's killing"" and vowed to ""continue to seek all relevant facts, consult Congress, and work with other nations to hold accountable those involved"". The Jamal Khashoggi story so far Jamal Khashoggi in his own words At a news conference in Riyadh on Thursday, Deputy Public Prosecutor Shalaan bin Rajih Shalaan saidKhashoggi's body was dismembered inside the consulate after his death,external. The body parts were then handed over to a local ""collaborator"" outside the grounds, he added. A composite sketch of the collaborator has been produced and investigations are continuing to locate the remains. Mr Shalaan did not identify any of those charged with the murder. Critics believe Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman would have been aware of the operation But he said investigations had ""revealed that the person who ordered the killing was the head of the negotiations team"" sent to Istanbul by deputy intelligence chief Gen Ahmed al-Assiri to force Khashoggi to return to Saudi Arabia from his self-imposed exile. ""[The crown prince] did not have any knowledge about it,"" he insisted. Prince Mohammed, the son of King Salman and Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler, has denied any role in what he has called a ""heinous crime that cannot be justified"". Critics believe it is highly unlikely he would not have been aware of the operation. Several of the 21 people arrested over the murder have been seen in his security detail in the past. Gen Assiri and Mr Qahtani have also been sacked over the incident. Mr Shalaan said Mr Qahtani had been banned from travelling and remained under investigation, but he did not say what had happened to Gen Assiri. Who was Jamal Khashoggi? Is Saudi crown prince finished? Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has said ""the order to kill Khashoggi came from the highest levels of the Saudi government"" but that he does not believe King Salman gave it. This video can not be played Jamal Khashoggi's fiancee: ""We didn't say any goodbyes"" Turkey's Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said on Thursday that some of the statements by the Saudi deputy public prosecutor were ""unsatisfactory"". ""They say this person was killed because he resisted, whereas this murder was premeditated,"" he told reporters. ""Again, they say he was dismembered... but this isn't a spontaneous thing. The necessary equipment and people were previously brought in to kill and later dismember him."" Turkish officials have alleged that the 15 Saudi agents who flew to Istanbul in the hours before the murder, one of whom is believed to have been a forensic pathologist working for the Saudi interior ministry, were carrying a bone saw. ""Those who gave the command as well as instigators should also be clarified and this process should not be covered up,"" Mr Cavusoglu said, adding that Turkey would ""shed light on this murder in all its aspects.""

Man shot and burned in wife's murder plot,"Ray Weatherall was shot in the face in one of the murder attempts A wife plotted with her lover and his daughter to kill her terminally ill husband by poisoning him and shooting him in the face. Ray Weatherall survived a number of attempts on his life, including a swimming pool heater explosion which left him with second degree burns His wife Hayley Weatherall, 32, also planned to kill him using sleeping tablets and insulin. A jury at Maidstone Crown Court found her guilty of conspiracy to murder. Her lover Glenn Pollard, 49, and his daughter Heather, 20, were also convicted of the same charge. The court heard Mr Weatherall, 53, was told by doctors in early 2016 he had just 18 months to live. Jurors were told his wife had been having an affair with Pollard, who was her husband's best friend, and they planned to have a new life together. Prosecutor Simon Taylor said there had been a series of plots on Mr Weatherall's life, including the swimming pool explosion and the poison plan. The court heard there was an aborted plan by Glenn Pollard to push Mr Weatherall overboard during a fishing trip in a boat they co-owned. On 29 November last year Mr Weatherall was shot in the face at Sandwich Marina, but survived when the bullet hit his right cheekbone. The conspiracy only came to light when Heather Pollard's car was found to have been near the marina at the time of the shooting. The court heard both the Pollards had access to guns, with Glenn a registered owner of a rifle found to be consistent with firing the ""sniper"" shot. Heather Pollard, described as a ""devoted"" daughter, also carried out internet searches on the best ways to kill somebody and not get caught, the court heard. Weatherall, from Ash near Canterbury, and Glenn and Heather Pollard, of Church Lane in West Stourmouth, Canterbury, will be sentenced on Tuesday.

PC convicted of raping 13-year-old girl,"Ian Naude admitted having sex with the teenager, but said it was consensual A policeman described as a ""committed paedophile"" has been convicted of raping a 13-year-old girl. PC Ian Naude, 30, joined Cheshire Constabulary ""to gain the keys to a sweetshop"" through access to potential victims, Liverpool Crown Court heard. The rape, which took place in his car, was filmed on his mobile phone. Footage of the attack was played to the jury. It has emerged Naude was already being investigated for sex offences when he became a student officer in April 2017. How a predatory paedophile become a PC Naude, of Market Drayton in Shropshire, was also found guilty of four charges of attempting to arrange the commission of a child sex offence and one charge of arranging a child sex offence, relating to five complainants aged between 12 and 15. The father of one, originally from South Africa, previously admitted 31 offences relating to grooming underage girls via a fake Facebook and Snapchat profile. Naude raped the girl after being called to her home to attend a domestic incident Cheshire Constabulary said Naude had passed the vetting process in October 2016 but that allegations of sex offences being investigated by two neighbouring forces in early 2017 did not get picked up. Latest news from the West Midlands During his two-week trial, Naude denied rape and sexual assault as he claimed the sex with the 13-year-old girl was consensual and that she ""seemed to be enjoying it"". The court was told he met the girl after he was called to her house over a domestic incident in October 2017. After looking her up on Facebook and exchanging sexual messages and photos, he returned to her home three days later. He picked her up while her mother was out and drove her to a country lane where he attacked her. Naude used names including ""Bruce Wayne"" and ""King of the North"" on fake profiles Naude deleted more than 750 photos from his phone after an ""administrative error"" meant he had been copied into emails relating to the police investigation into his conduct. He also concealed other devices including a second phone and a laptop in a field in Market Drayton. Cheshire Constabulary said this had ""frustrated"" and ""set back"" the investigation. Texts sent by Naude revealed a pattern, always starting conversations with ""Hi, you look pretty and interesting"", before quickly demanding nude images and threatening to expose girls to their friends if they refused.

Prince William criticises social media firms,"The Duke of Cambridge has accused social media firms of not being proactive enough about dealing with fake news, privacy issues and cyber-bullying. In a speech given at the BBC, Prince William said social networks had allowed ""misinformation and conspiracy to pollute the public sphere"". ""Their self-image is so grounded in their positive power for good that they seem unable to engage in constructive discussion about the social problems they are creating,"" he warned. The prince and the Duchess of Cambridge had been invited to the BBC to try out a new internet safety app. During their visit, the royal couple met children and their parents who had helped design it. ""The tools that we use to congratulate each other on milestones and successes can also be used to normalise speech that is filled with bile and hate. The websites we use to stay connected can for some create profound feelings of loneliness and inadequacy,"" said the Prince in his speech. The prince said tech firms had a ""great deal to learn"" on responsibility. ""Social media companies have done more to connect the world than has ever been achieved in human history. Surely you can connect with each other about smart ways to deal with the unintended consequences of these connections,"" he said. ""You can reject the false choice of profits over values. You can choose to do good and be successful."" Facebook accused of dark PR tactics Facebook leaks take their toll Fake news: Can teenagers spot it? The BBC put the prince's criticism to Facebook's chief executive Mark Zuckerberg. He said part of the challenge was figuring out how to balance the privacy users wanted against a desire to do more to crack down on bad behaviour. ""I do think there's some trade-off on some of these issues between privacy and some of the safety work,"" Mr Zuckerberg said. ""A lot of what we are trying to do is architect the systems to give people really good privacy too. ""This is why these are big and important questions, and why broadly across society people don't necessarily agree on actually where you should draw the line."" Another executive added that Facebook was using artificial intelligence to root out unacceptable behaviour, but it was harder to identify cases of cyber-bullying than other problems because the nature of the messages involved was so personal. Prince William and Catherine met parents and children at the BBC This is far from the first time The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have spoken out about cyber-bullying. They launched a taskforce to tackle the problem in June 2016, which involved Facebook, Snapchat and Google among others. They have returned to the issue since, but this does represent a change of tone. Rather than focusing on co-operation, this time the prince accused the tech leaders of posturing, being too proud and defensive, and having put their shareholders' interests above those of their users. Moreover, the prince said he was ""disappointed"" that the taskforce he had built had failed to achieve more. For Facebook in particular, this couldn't come at a worse time. The firm has been beset by data breach scandals, claims its products encourage loneliness and depression, and evidence its apps have been used to meddle with elections. And on Wednesday, the New York Times published a fresh series of claims about dubious backroom tactics as the social network tried to fight back against all the negative publicity. During a lengthy press conference this evening, chief executive Mark Zuckerberg acknowledged that there had been a lot of issues his firm had been behind on and that ""a lot of the critique of the company is fair"". But he said that he was ""very clearly involved"" in addressing users' concerns andpointed to an essay he had just published to update them on his efforts,external. He added, however, that he and his team could not ""snap our fingers"" and resolve all the complaints quickly - rather it would likely take years. The dangers for Facebook are that its members may not be willing to stick around that long and that politicians may feel the need to introduce tougher regulations in the meantime. The BBC is a member of an industry-wide taskforce set up by the princeto tackle cyber-bullying. After being greeted by excited crowds outside the BBC studios in central London, the royal couple were pictured with BBC director general Tony Hall and the director of BBC Children's, Alice Webb. Alice Webb (left) and Lord Hall (second left) hosted the royals for their visit to the BBC The royals tried out an app designed to tackle online bullying During Thursday's brief visit, the couple also met young people who wrote and performed a new video for a campaign run by the Prince's cyber-bullying taskforce. The campaign, called ""Stop, Speak, Support"", involves a national code of conduct for children on what to do if they come across bullying online. The royal couple also met Radio 1 breakfast show presenter Greg James, who has changed job since their last visit to the BBC It is not the first time the royal couple have visited the BBC - in 2017 theydropped in on Radio 1and helped read the UK's Official Chart with Greg James.

Grindr cheat 'killed wife with Tesco bag',"Jessica Patel was strangled at the couple's home in Linthorpe A pharmacist suffocated his wife with a Tesco Bag For Life in an attempt to claim a Â£2m insurance payout and move to Australia with his boyfriend, a court has heard. Mitesh Patel, 37, owned and ran the pharmacy business with Jessica, 34, who was strangled at their home in Middlesbrough in May. He denies her murder. Jurors at Teesside Crown Court have heard Mr Patelcheated on his wife with menhe met through dating app Grindr. Nicholas Campbell QC, prosecuting, said the defendant claimed he returned home to find the couple's house burgled and his wife's wrists bound with duct tape. However, Mr Campbell said, the intruder story was a ""lie"" and Mr Patel had applied the tape after killing her. He left the house on The Avenue, Linthorpe, to create a false alibi and tried to stage-manage the murder scene by ransacking the home, jurors heard. ""Jessica Patel had been killed as a result of pressure being brought to bear on her neck. She was strangled,"" Mr Campbell said. ""The prosecution case was that a plastic shopping bag, ironically a Tesco Bag For Life, was used both as a ligature and to suffocate her."" Upon returning, Mr Patel attempted to hide a hard drive from a CCTV system in a suitcase under a mattress, the court heard, before calling 999. He was found to have three scratches on his neck on the night his wife was killed, Mr Campbell said. The court heard he was seen after the killing and noticed to be behaving strangely, by which time his wife had been dead for an hour. Mr Patel had ""ample"" motive for the killing, jurors heard, as there were various life insurance policies in his wife's name worth Â£2m. He planned the murder ""for some time"" and researched the length of time it would take to die from strangulation, Mr Campbell said. ""He was planning to use the money to start a new life in Australia and that life would be shared with the person who he really loved, one who he regarded as his soul mate - another man,"" he said. Religious artefacts from the house's prayer room, which Mr Patel had included in a list of things he wanted to take to Australia, were left untouched in the alleged burglary, Mr Campbell said.

EU warns of 'long road ahead',"Mr Barnier (L) formally hands the agreement to European Council head Donald Tusk The EU says much work still needs to be done on Brexit, despite agreeing a draft withdrawal document with the UK. ""We still have a long road ahead of us on both sides,"" chief negotiator Michel Barnier said. The EU has set out a series of meetings leading to one on 25 November where it plans to approve the Brexit agreement. UK Prime Minister Theresa May has won the backing of her cabinet but faces a tough task getting the agreement approved by Parliament. LIVE: Follow the Brexit story Brexit: A guide to where we are Watch: What is Brexit? A sign of that came on Thursday morning when Mr Barnier's UK counterpart,Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab, resignedsaying he could not ""in good conscience"" support the agreement. He was one of four ministers to quit. Mrs May later defended the deal in the House of Commons, telling MPs it delivered on the Brexit referendum and provided for an orderly withdrawal. Mr Barnier was speaking on Thursday morning alongside EU Council head Donald Tusk as the chief negotiator formally handed overthe 585-page draft withdrawal agreement.,external Mr Barnier said the agreement was fair and balanced, took into account the UK's needs and laid the ground for an ""ambitious new partnership"". Mr Tusk praised Mr Barnier's work and said the agreement had ""secured the interests of the 27 member states and EU as a whole"". He laid out the timetable for the days ahead. EU member states will analyse the document and at the end of the week national envoys will share their assessments A political declaration on future ties between the EU and the UK will be agreed by Tuesday and members will have 48 hours to evaluate it The EU Council will then meet on 25 November to finalise the agreement ""if nothing extraordinary happens"", Mr Tusk said. The leaders of the 27 EU nations must approve the deal Mr Tusk said: ""Since the very beginning, we have had no doubt that Brexit is a lose-lose situation, and that our negotiations are only about damage control."" Addressing the UK, he added: ""As much as I am sad to see you leave, I will do everything to make this farewell the least painful possible, for you and for us."" Pound dives after Brexit resignations Mr Barnier later took the document to the European Parliament. Its president, Antonio Tajani, said MEPs would vote on the deal in early 2019. If the agreement is approved by both sides, a 21-month transition period will kick in, during which a trade deal and the thorny issue of how to ensure there is no physical border between Northern Ireland - part of the UK - and the Republic of Ireland will need to be worked out. A smooth border-free exchange underpins the peace deal that ended the Northern Ireland conflict. The draft withdrawal agreement covers so-called ""divorce"" issues as the UK prepares to leave the EU. It includes a ""financial settlement"" from the UK, thought to be about Â£39bn (â¬45bn; $50bn). Speaking at a press briefing in Brussels on Wednesday, Mr Barnier addressed one of the major concerns of the divorce, the Irish ""hard border"" issue. He said that to avoid the need for physical checks on goods or infrastructure at the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, the EU would work with the UK to agree a trade deal. However if talks fail, the so-called ""backstop"" measure would be used. Q&A: Irish border backstop EU fears UK politics will scupper the deal Guide: Brexit and immigration Both sides have resolved to ensure the backstop is not necessary by coming up with alternative arrangements. Please upgrade your browser ""If we are not ready by 2020, we can extend the provision so we have more time, and if we are still not there with the future agreement after this, the backstop agreement would kick in,"" he said. ""There will be a UK-wide single customs territory which Northern Ireland will remain in, and Northern Ireland will remain aligned to the rules of a single market essential for avoiding a border including on agriculture policy."" The draft withdrawal agreement states that the transition period may be extended by mutual consent. What does the transition period mean? Mr Barnier said that any extension would by a one-off, ""by a limited period and by joint agreement"". During the transition, the UK will be out of the EU. It will have no voting rights but will continue to abide by the majority of its rules. There are also special protocols in place for Gibraltar and Cyprus to enable people there ""to continue to live as they do today"", Mr Barnier added. Spain has longstanding claims to the British Overseas Territory of Gibraltar and the deal sets out bilateral co-operation on customs, policing, trade, taxation and citizens' rights. The UK has sovereign military bases in Cyprus. EU law will continue to apply at the bases, with the deal securing the rights of the 11,000 Cypriot civilians working there. Analysis by BBC Europe editor, Katya Adler The EU knows there is a very real possibility the Brexit deal could be voted down by the UK Parliament in a few weeks' time. I put the question to Michel Barnier on Wednesday night at his press conference - but, skilled politician that he is, he refused to engage. Brussels is very keen indeed not to give the impression that the EU might change or come up with a ""better"" Brexit deal text if this one ends up being rejected in the House of Commons. Mr Barnier quoted Theresa May as saying that this is a deal in the UK's interest.

"No Brexit renegotiation, EU leaders warn","Mrs Merkel said talks to amend the draft agreement were unlikely as a deal was ""on the table"" EU leaders have dismissed talk of renegotiating the draft Brexit deal and warned the UK's political situation could make a ""no-deal"" more likely. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said there was ""no question"" of reopening talks as a document was ""on the table"". Meanwhile French PM Edouard Philippe said there was a need to prepare for a no-deal because of UK ""uncertainty"". The EU has set out a series of meetings leading up to 25 November when it plans to approve the Brexit agreement.

Laura Kuenssberg: Raab gives damning verdict on deal,"This video can not be played Dominic Raab, who quit as Brexit secretary, says a change of course is needed 12:00 GMT: I've just been speaking to Dominic Raab, the now former Brexit Secretary. His verdict on the prime minister's deal is damning. He told me that because of the way the agreement treats Northern Ireland and the rest of the country differently - and the way the country couldn't decide on its own to leave the so-called backstop - that the draft deal is a betrayal of people's trust. Mr Raab, who says he told the chief whip straight after cabinet yesterday that he would quit, says the prime minister can still change course, and should be ready to walk away with no deal. He insists the short-term disruption that might entail - which many of his colleagues think would be catastrophic - would be worth it. Better in his view to tolerate short-term pain, than lock ourselves into a dreadful arrangement for years and years to come. That prospect horrifies others in the government, and on the backbenches too. But it's a risk worth taking he says - claiming it's the best way to proceed, to be willing to risk no deal in the face of what he describes as the EU's ""blackmail"". The alternative for the prime minister, carrying on like this, he says, is inevitable defeat in the Commons and who knows what would happen then. Might he put himself forward if it all falls apart? His answer was it is ""irresponsible"" to be talking about that right now. But notably, not ruling himself out and knowing, perhaps in a few days' or weeks' time, he might have to give a very different answer. Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab resigns Reality Check: What does the draft withdrawal agreement reveal? 10:00 GMT: A resignation in itself is not a surprise - but the departure of the Brexit secretary might be the domino that causes everything else to fall. It's not just that it was his job to make the policy work. It's because he has just given unhappy Brexiteers someone to rally round, and someone who sees himself as a potential challenger to the PM. After his departure, it becomes extremely difficult for other Brexiteers unhappy about the deal to stay on. And in the last few minutes Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey has decided to leave the government. There is speculation about International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt too, although sources close to her say a departure today is far from definite. Meanwhile, No 10 is busy trying to explain its policy this morning to opposition politicians and then to Parliament in the next hour. But there have been three resignations from government - Northern Ireland minister Shailesh Vara was the first to quit - and it's not even 10:00 GMT. It's too early to say if this morning's storm will be a hurricane that will sweep the policy, and maybe the prime minister away.

Laura Kuenssberg: May at the mercy of events,"This video can not be played BBC's Laura Kuenssberg asks the PM if she ""in office, but not really in power?"" She fights on. More than two years since the vote to leave the European Union we do know the kind of relationship that the country could build with the rest of the continent after Brexit. We do know the prime minister has every intention of staying on to push it through. But we don't know whether it's politically possible, whether it could get through Parliament. Live: May defends Bexit deal May: I am going to see this through We don't know who the person in charge of the process will be - the Brexit secretary. And, most glaringly, we actually don't know if the prime minister will still be in place to try to push her deal through. The government, for today at least, is at the mercy of events not in control. Her vow to stay on tonight does not make her deep, deep problems disappear. With her party in revolt, her colleagues departing - some determined to usher her out of office - we can't, and don't know yet, if Brexit can happen as planned, perhaps, if at all. This could be a gale that's weathered in a few days, or a serious storm that sweeps the government away. But while the prime minister's future is so uncertain, so is all of ours.

BeyoncÃÂ© cuts ties with Philip Green,"BeyoncÃ© has ended a business venture with Topshop boss Sir Philip Green by buying him out of Ivy Park, the gymwear label they founded together. The pair launched Ivy Park two years ago, playing on the personal brand of the US singer and outspoken feminist. The buyout comes weeks after Sir Philip was named as having taken legal action to prevent publication of allegations of sexual harassment of staff. Sir Philip says he ""categorically and wholly"" denies the allegations. However, BeyoncÃ© had faced pressure from campaigners to cut ties. In a statement on Thursday, Ivy Park said: ""After discussions of almost a year, Parkwood has acquired 100% of the Ivy Park brand. Topshop - Arcadia will fulfil the existing orders."" Sir Philip Green: From 'King of the High Street' to 'unacceptable face of capitalism' Naming Green 'right thing to do', says Hain Ivy Park sells items such as hoodies and leggings, part of a trend towards so called athleisure. BeyoncÃ© and Sir Philip had both owned 50% stakes in the label, which is named after the singer's daughter with rapper Jay Z, Blue Ivy. Sir Philip, one of Britain's best known businessmen, was named in parliament last month by Lord Hain as the man behind a court injunction preventing the publication of allegations of sexual harassment and racial abuse of staff. In a statement last month, he denied having broken the law and said his businesses fully investigated employee grievances. Topshop dismantles feminism pop-up However, campaign Equality Now had called for BeyoncÃ© to end her relationship with the tycoon, arguing it was at odds with her stated principles. Yasmeen Hassan, from the campaign group, said in October: ""BeyoncÃ© has put herself forward as a women's rights activist. She and her team need to look closely at these allegations.""

Premier League confirms Scudamore's ÃÂ£5m bonus,"Richard Scudamore joined the Premier League in November 1999 as chief executive before becoming executive chairman in June 2014 Outgoing executive chairman Richard Scudamore will receive a Â£5m farewell bonus paid by clubs, the Premier League has confirmed. Scudamore will receive the payment over a three-year period ""in recognition of his outstanding work"". He will remain with the Premier League in an advisory capacity. It comes after football fans urged clubs not to ""stick their hands down the back of the sofa"" and contribute to Scudamore's departing gift. Scudamore - who reportedly earns Â£2.5m per season - is stepping down in December after 19 years at the organisation. The Premier League's UK television rights were valued at about Â£670m when Scudamore joined the organisation in 1999, while the most recent deal was worth Â£5.14bn. All 20 Premier League clubs were asked by Chelsea chairman Bruce Buck for aÂ£250,000 contribution- something which fans ""strongly opposed"". ""Premier League clubs have always told fan groups that budgets are planned in advance and there's not a surplus of cash lying around from their extremely lucrative TV deal,"" said the Football Supporters' Federation (FSF). ""In the meantime, loyal football supporters continue to be inconvenienced by fixture changes to fit TV schedules, often losing out on travel costs or struggling to get to and from games in the first place. ""Now it appears clubs can stick their hands down the back of the sofa and find Â£250,000 at a moment's notice."" Speaking outside the meeting of all Premier League clubs on Thursday, Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy said: ""We are all very supportive [of the payment]. ""He has unique knowledge and experience which is going to be of ongoing benefit to the Premier League. It's absolutely a fair payment and all the clubs were behind it."" West Ham co-chairman David Gold said he backed the payment to Scudamore. ""He deserves everything he gets,"" Gold said. ""This is all very appropriate and we're all very pleased."" On Tuesday, the Premier League announced thatSusanna Dinnage will be its new chief executive. Dan Roan, BBC sports editor With the vast amounts of TV money swilling around Premier League football, the game has often been accused of a culture of greed. Whether it is the rising amounts spent on player wages, agents' fees, and managerial pay-offs, and controversy over a possible 'Big Six' breakaway, the proposed 39th game, ticket prices for away supporters, and clubs not paying staff a living-wage, to some the game resides in a bubble. But rarely before has there been outrage from fans quite like the one sparked by Scudamore's Â£5m pay-off. Perhaps that is partly down to the timing. The recent collapse of the sale of Wembley highlighted the poor state of the country's grassroots facilities, and the Football Leaks allegations last week against Manchester City were also damaging for the league's reputation. The majority of the clubs feel Scudamore's long and commercially successful tenure deserves to be rewarded, and point out that he will continue to advise them. But the bonus (and the fact that there was no vote called to give dissenting clubs a chance to oppose the payment) will still be viewed by many as a PR own-goal. One which overshadows the positive news of the appointment of the league's first female CEO this week, and which undermines public awareness of the clubs' investment in good causes, and it's global popularity.

Raab quits over 'flawed' Brexit agreement,"This video can not be played Dominic Raab, who quit as Brexit secretary, says a change of course is needed Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab says he quit the cabinet over ""fatal flaws"" in the draft Brexit agreement with the EU. And he told the BBC the UK should be ready to risk a no-deal Brexit in the face of EU ""blackmail"". Another cabinet minister, Esther McVey, also quit alongside junior ministers Suella Braverman and Shailesh Vara. PM Theresa May faced nearly three hours of largely hostile questions in the Commons and could potentially face a vote of no confidence from Tory MPs. BBC political editorLaura Kuenssberg said,externala source had told her Michael Gove has been offered the job of Brexit Secretary and he was understood to be considering it, but to be asking for assurances that he could pursue a different kind of deal. Leading backbench Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg has submitted a letter of no confidence in her to Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the Tories' backbench 1922 Committee. A vote will be triggered if 48 Tory MPs write letters to Sir Graham. It is understood 48 letters have not yet been received. Mr Rees-Mogg told reporters that the negotiations had ""given way on all the key points"" adding: ""The deal risks Brexit because it is not a proper Brexit."" He denied being involved in a coup against the PM, saying he was ""working through the procedures of the Conservative Party"" which was ""entirely constitutional"". Live: Reaction to Raab resignation Guide: Rules for any challenge to Theresa May Reality Check: What does the draft withdrawal agreement reveal? 'PM has broken Brexit promises' - DUP Mr Rees-Mogg said he did not have any leadership ambitions of his ownbut listed BrexiteersBoris Johnson, David Davis, Dominic Raab, Esther McVey and Penny Mordaunt as among those who would be ""very capable of leading a proper Brexit"". Downing Street said Mrs May would fight any no-confidence vote. Asked by Labour MP Mike Gapes if it was time she ""stood aside for someone else who could take this country forward in a united way"", Mrs May replied: ""No."" This video can not be played How the Conservative Party handles a leadership challenge Chief whip Julian Smith said the prime minister ""will not be bullied"" into changing course. And Foreign Office minister Sir Alan Duncan described Mr Rees-Mogg's comments as ""deeply destructive"" and warned Conservative MPs: ""If this government is undermined further, we could destroy the government, we could significantly damage and even destroy the Conservative Party, all of which would be happening in the middle of an unconcluded set of Brexit negotiations."" He added: ""We have a massive responsibility to exercise our judgement in a climate of what has to be compromise."" This video can not be played Theresa May tells MPs: ""I don't pretend this has been a comfortable process."" The day after Theresa May announced that she had secured the backing of her cabinet for the withdrawal agreement, she told MPs it was not a final agreement, but brought the UK ""close to a Brexit deal"". But she was met with laughter and shouts of ""resign"" as she said it would allow the UK to leave the EU ""in a smooth and orderly way"" on 29 March The prime minister told MPs the agreement would deliver the Brexit people voted for and allow the UK to take back control of its ""money, laws and borders"". But Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn said: ""This is not the deal the country was promised and Parliament cannot - and I believe will not - accept a false choice between this bad deal and no deal."" Dominic Raab - a Leave supporter promoted to the cabinet to replace David Davis who quit in protest at Mrs May's Brexit plans in July - is the most high-profile minister to quit the government. He was closely involved in drafting the 585-page document, which sets out the terms of Britain's departure from the EU. He told the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg: ""I've been fighting for a good Brexit deal but the terms proposed to the cabinet yesterday [Wednesday], I think, had two major and fatal flaws. ""The first is that the terms being offered by the EU threaten the integrity of the United Kingdom and the second is that they would lead to an indefinite if not permanent situation where we're locked into a regime with no say over the rules being applied, with no exit mechanism. ""I think that would be damaging for the economy but devastating for public trust in our democracy."" He said Theresa May needed a Brexit secretary who ""will pursue the deal that she wants to put to the country with conviction"". ""I don't feel I can do that in good conscience,"" he added. He said he held Mrs May in ""high esteem"" but said: ""I do think we need to change course on Brexit"". And he said the government should be willing to risk a no-deal Brexit in the face of what he described as the EU's ""blackmail"". The alternative for the prime minister was her inevitable defeat in the Commons, he argued. Asked if he would put himself forward for leader, if the government falls apart, he did not rule it out but said it would be ""irresponsible"" to be talking about that now. Kuenssberg: Raab gives a damning verdict on PM's deal In her resignation letter, Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey told Mrs May the agreement does not ""honour the result of the referendum, indeed it does not meet the tests you set from the outset of your premiership"". ""We have gone from 'no deal is better than a bad deal' to any deal is better than no deal,"" she added. Anne-Marie Trevelyan, a ministerial aide at the education department, has also quit, as has Ranil Jayawardena,a ministerial aide at the justice department. Northern Ireland minister Shailesh Vara was the first to resign over Mrs May's agreement on Thursday morning, saying, it ""leaves the UK in a halfway house with no time limit on when we will finally be a sovereign nation"". Brexit minister Suella Braverman also quit. And Rehman Chisti quit as vice chairman of the Conservative Party - partly over the withdrawal agreement. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: ""No deal is not a real option, and the government has not seriously prepared for it."" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: ""After two years of bungled negotiations, the government has produced a botched deal that breaches the prime minister's own red lines and does not meet our six tests. ""The government is in chaos. Their deal risks leaving the country in an indefinite halfway house without a real say."" The SNP's leader at Westminster Ian Blackford said Mrs May was ""trying to sell us a deal that is already dead in the water"" and expressed outrage that Scotland was not mentioned once in the draft withdrawal agreement. commitments over citizens' rights after Brexit - people will be able to work and study where they currently live and to be joined by family members a proposed 21-month transition period after the UK's departure a ""fair financial settlement"" from the UK - also known as the Â£39bn ""divorce bill"" But the controversial part relates to what will happen to the Irish border. The agreement includes a ""backstop"" - a kind of safety net to ensure there is no hard border whatever the outcome of future trade talks between the UK and the EU. This video can not be played When will Brexit happen? If there is no trade deal in place by the end of the transition period, the backstop will mean that Northern Ireland would stay aligned to some EU rules on things such as food products and goods standards. It would also involve a temporary single customs territory, effectively keeping the whole of the UK in the EU customs union. Brexiteers do not like the prospect of potentially being tied to EU customs rules for years or even, as some fear, indefinitely. And Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party has said it will not tolerate anything that creates a new border down the Irish Sea and they will not vote for the agreement. Setting out details of the arrangements for a possible ""backstop"", Mrs May said: ""I do not pretend that this has been a comfortable process, or that either we or the EU are entirely happy with some of the arrangements which have been included in it."" But she added that ""while some people might pretend otherwise, there is no deal which delivers the Brexit the British people voted for which does not involve this insurance policy"". She insisted it was a last resort and would be time-limited. Please upgrade your browser Much will depend on whether Mrs May faces a vote of no-confidence in her leadership. If she does, all bets are off. If not, European Council President Donald Tusk has announced an emergency meeting of EU leaders in Brussels on 25 November, at which the withdrawal agreement and a political declaration on future relations would be finalised and formalised. The BBC's Brussels correspondent Adam Fleming said the UK and the EU will have to agree an ultimate end date for the post-Brexit transition period by the end of next week. The transition period is due to end in 2020 and can be extended once by mutual agreement. The text of the draft withdrawal agreement currently says the end date is ""20XX"". A senior EU official said the negotiators will have to fill in a specific year by the 25 November summit. Ultimately any deal would be put to MPs. Tory backbencher Mark Francois told Mrs May earlier that with Labour, the SNP, the Lib Dems and scores of Tory MPs planning to vote against it, it is ""mathematically impossible to get this deal through the House of Commons"".

May defiant over Brexit deal amid backlash,"This video can not be played Theresa May asked about no-confidence vote: ""Am I going to see this through? Yes."" Theresa May has dismissed speculation she could be ousted as prime minister over her Brexit agreement, saying: ""I am going to see this through."" Despite a series of ministers resigning and talk of a no-confidence vote, she vowed to get the deal signed off in Brussels and to put it to MPs. ""The course I have set out is the right one for our country,"" she said. The BBC understands Michael Gove has rejected Mrs May's offer to become the new Brexit secretary. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said Environment Secretary Mr Gove had said he might accept - if he could try to make changes to the negotiated deal. Sources said Mrs May made it clear that was not possible. He is now considering his position and contemplating resignation. Other sources have told the BBC a wider group of ministers were discussing whether to try to force the PM to seek changes to the deal. Earlier, Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab and Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey both quit in protest at the withdrawal agreement, along with two junior ministers. And leading backbench Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg submitted a letter of no confidence in Mrs May to Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the Tories' backbench 1922 Committee. Live: Theresa May defends Brexit deal No Brexit renegotiation, EU leaders warn Raab quits over 'flawed' Brexit agreement Guide: Rules for any challenge to Theresa May A vote will be triggered if 48 Tory MPs write letters to Sir Graham - it is understood 48 letters have not yet been received. Mrs May spent nearly three hours fielding largely critical questions from MPs before holding a press conference in Downing Street to further answer her critics. This video can not be played ""Negotiations give away on all key points"": Jacob Rees-Mogg on the PM's draft Brexit deal She acknowledged the agreement negotiated with the EU had entailed ""difficult and sometimes uncomfortable decisions"". ""I understand fully that there are some who are unhappy with those compromises but this deal delivers what people voted for and it is in the national interest,"" she said. ""We can only secure it, if we unite behind the agreement reached in cabinet yesterday. ""If we do not move forward with that agreement, nobody can know for sure the consequences that will follow. ""It will be to take a path of deep and grave uncertainty when the British people just want us to get on with it. They are looking to the Conservative Party to deliver."" Reality Check: What does the draft withdrawal agreement reveal? Asked if she would carry on as prime minister if she won a no-confidence vote by a single vote, Mrs May said: ""Leadership is about taking the right decisions, not the easy ones."" She said her job was to ""bring back a deal that delivers on the vote of the British people"". She added: ""I believe this is a deal which does deliver that, which is in the national interest and am I going to see this through? Yes."" This video can not be played How the Conservative Party handles a leadership challenge The prime minister, a cricket fan, was asked if she would ""resign as captain"", but told journalists Geoffrey Boycott, famed for his batting marathons, was one of her sporting heroes: ""And what do you know about Geoffrey Boycott? Geoffrey Boycott stuck to it and he got the runs in the end."" Amid suggestions she was struggling to fill the two cabinet posts vacated by Dominic Raab and Esther McVey earlier on Thursday, she joked: ""I have had, actually, rather a busy day."" The BBC understands that Environment Secretary Michael Gove had been offered the job as Brexit Secretary but had asked for assurances that he could pursue a different kind of deal. Mrs May said Mr Gove was doing ""an excellent job at Defra"" adding: ""I haven't appointed a new Dexeu [Department for Exiting the European Union] secretary yet and I will be making appointments to the government in due course."" By BBC Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg The government, for today at least, is at the mercy of events not in control. Theresa May's vow to stay does not make her deep, deep problems disappear. With her party in revolt, her colleagues departing - some determined to usher her out of office - we can't, and don't know yet, if Brexit can happen as planned, perhaps, if at all. This could be a gale that's weathered in a few days, or a serious storm that sweeps the government away. Read Laura's blog Meanwhile German Chancellor Angela Merkel said there was no appetite for further talks on possible amendments to the current agreement: ""We have a document on the table that Britain and the EU 27 have agreed to, so for me there is no question at the moment whether we negotiate further."" Despite a warning from Tory backbencher Mark Francois earlier that it would be ""mathematically impossible to get this deal through the House of Commons"", Mrs May said she believed, ultimately, her MPs would back it. ""I'm committed, as prime minister, to bringing the best deal back to the UK. I think MPs across my party who look at that deal will recognise the importance of delivering on the vote of the British people and recognise the importance of doing that in a way that does protect people's jobs, protect security and protect the unity of our United Kingdom."" This video can not be played BBC's Laura Kuenssberg asks the PM if she ""in office, but not really in power?"" But Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable suggested the prime minister was ""in denial"": ""The facts haven't changed. There is no majority in Parliament for her deal, and she has rightly conceded that ""No Brexit"" is the real alternative to it."" He said it strengthened the case for another referendum ""to break the deadlock and get the country out of this mess"". Earlier Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn described the deal negotiated with the EU as ""half-baked"" and urged her to withdraw it. He told MPs: ""This is not the deal the country was promised and Parliament cannot - and I believe will not - accept a false choice between this bad deal and no deal."" But Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley defended the prime minister, saying ""there is no better person to do this job"". She said collective responsibility meant that ministers who could not support the deal were required to resign, but added: ""The majority of the cabinet is behind it. The remaining members of the cabinet are absolutely behind this deal and what we need to do now is get behind the prime minister and get that deal sorted in the November (European) Council.""

Rules for any challenge to May,"A majority of Tory MPs have said they want Boris Johnson to remain party leader and prime minister. But critics suggest his authority has been undermined and he still faces challenges to keep his job. All 359 Conservative MPs took part in the vote. Mr Johnson received the support of 211 of them, with 148 voting against him. The result means Mr Johnson was supported by 59% of his MPs. As the ballot was held in secret, Tory MPs don't have to say how they voted, but some have chosen to do so. The PM will know his opponents are not defeated Boris Johnson is not the first prime minister to have been challenged. Theresa May: In a vote over her Brexit policy, Mrs May survived a confidence vote witha majority of 83 in December 2018. Despite winning, she resigned as PM six months later Iain Duncan Smith:Following months of speculation the Tory leadernarrowly lost a confidence vote in October 2003,externaland resigned John Major:Triggered a contest in 1995 byresigning as leader of the Tory party(though not as prime minister) amid disagreements inside the party over Europe. Mr Major beat challenger John Redwood, but went on to lose the 1997 election Margaret Thatcher:Resigned as PM in 1990 afterfailing to win outright victory for party leadership,external. She beat Michael Heseltine by 204 votes to 152, but was persuaded to stand down by her Cabinet Having survived, Mr Johnson can continue as Conservative Party leader and therefore prime minister. However, by-elections to pick new MPs in Wakefield and Tiverton and Honiton will be held on 23 June. If they are taken by opposition parties, Mr Johnson could find himself under renewed pressure. Although Mr Johnson won the vote, MPs could still consider options to try to remove him: Change the rules At present, Conservative MPs will not be allowed to hold another confidence vote for a year. However, there has been speculation the rules could be changed, in order to hold another vote sooner. When asked about it, Sir Graham Brady MP - the chairman of a group called the 1922 Committee, which represents Tory backbenchers - said ""technically, it's possible"". Cabinet pressure The Cabinet - made up senior members of the government - could put political pressure on the PM to resign. This happened toMargaret Thatcher in 1990,external, despite having defeated Michael Heseltine who had challenged for the leadership. A far less likely route would be for the Cabinet to go the Queen and declare they don't have confidence in the PM. However, this ""would drag the Queen into a very difficult position"" says Catherine Haddon from the Institute for Government. Motion of no confidence in the prime minister A confidence vote where all MPs - not just Conservatives - get to vote has been proposed by Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey. The government is very unlikely to make time in Parliament to hold such a vote, according to Ms Haddon. However, if the leader of the opposition - Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer - introduces the motion, convention means the government will provide time. It would need just one more MP to vote in favour than the number voting against in order to pass. However, Tory MPs are very unlikely to go down this path says Ms Haddon: ""They would only use this mechanism as a last resort if they had no other way to dislodge Boris Johnson."" If Mr Johnson stood down, a leadership contest would be triggered. The eventual winner would become prime minister. In order to stand, candidates need the support of eight other Tory MPs. If there are more than two candidates, Tory MPs will hold a series of votes until only two remain. in the first round, candidates must get 5% of the votes to stay in the running (18 MPs) in the second round, they must get 10% (36 MPs) in the following rounds, the candidate with the least votes is eliminated When two MPs are left, Conservative Party members around the country - not just MPs - will vote for the winner.

Royal couple try One Show sofa on BBC trip,"The Duke of Cambridge has accused social media firms of not being proactive enough about dealing with fake news, privacy issues and cyber-bullying. In a speech given at the BBC, Prince William said social networks had allowed ""misinformation and conspiracy to pollute the public sphere"". ""Their self-image is so grounded in their positive power for good that they seem unable to engage in constructive discussion about the social problems they are creating,"" he warned. The prince and the Duchess of Cambridge had been invited to the BBC to try out a new internet safety app. During their visit, the royal couple met children and their parents who had helped design it. ""The tools that we use to congratulate each other on milestones and successes can also be used to normalise speech that is filled with bile and hate. The websites we use to stay connected can for some create profound feelings of loneliness and inadequacy,"" said the Prince in his speech. The prince said tech firms had a ""great deal to learn"" on responsibility. ""Social media companies have done more to connect the world than has ever been achieved in human history. Surely you can connect with each other about smart ways to deal with the unintended consequences of these connections,"" he said. ""You can reject the false choice of profits over values. You can choose to do good and be successful."" Facebook accused of dark PR tactics Facebook leaks take their toll Fake news: Can teenagers spot it? The BBC put the prince's criticism to Facebook's chief executive Mark Zuckerberg. He said part of the challenge was figuring out how to balance the privacy users wanted against a desire to do more to crack down on bad behaviour. ""I do think there's some trade-off on some of these issues between privacy and some of the safety work,"" Mr Zuckerberg said. ""A lot of what we are trying to do is architect the systems to give people really good privacy too. ""This is why these are big and important questions, and why broadly across society people don't necessarily agree on actually where you should draw the line."" Another executive added that Facebook was using artificial intelligence to root out unacceptable behaviour, but it was harder to identify cases of cyber-bullying than other problems because the nature of the messages involved was so personal. Prince William and Catherine met parents and children at the BBC This is far from the first time The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have spoken out about cyber-bullying. They launched a taskforce to tackle the problem in June 2016, which involved Facebook, Snapchat and Google among others. They have returned to the issue since, but this does represent a change of tone. Rather than focusing on co-operation, this time the prince accused the tech leaders of posturing, being too proud and defensive, and having put their shareholders' interests above those of their users. Moreover, the prince said he was ""disappointed"" that the taskforce he had built had failed to achieve more. For Facebook in particular, this couldn't come at a worse time. The firm has been beset by data breach scandals, claims its products encourage loneliness and depression, and evidence its apps have been used to meddle with elections. And on Wednesday, the New York Times published a fresh series of claims about dubious backroom tactics as the social network tried to fight back against all the negative publicity. During a lengthy press conference this evening, chief executive Mark Zuckerberg acknowledged that there had been a lot of issues his firm had been behind on and that ""a lot of the critique of the company is fair"". But he said that he was ""very clearly involved"" in addressing users' concerns andpointed to an essay he had just published to update them on his efforts,external. He added, however, that he and his team could not ""snap our fingers"" and resolve all the complaints quickly - rather it would likely take years. The dangers for Facebook are that its members may not be willing to stick around that long and that politicians may feel the need to introduce tougher regulations in the meantime. The BBC is a member of an industry-wide taskforce set up by the princeto tackle cyber-bullying. After being greeted by excited crowds outside the BBC studios in central London, the royal couple were pictured with BBC director general Tony Hall and the director of BBC Children's, Alice Webb. Alice Webb (left) and Lord Hall (second left) hosted the royals for their visit to the BBC The royals tried out an app designed to tackle online bullying During Thursday's brief visit, the couple also met young people who wrote and performed a new video for a campaign run by the Prince's cyber-bullying taskforce. The campaign, called ""Stop, Speak, Support"", involves a national code of conduct for children on what to do if they come across bullying online. The royal couple also met Radio 1 breakfast show presenter Greg James, who has changed job since their last visit to the BBC It is not the first time the royal couple have visited the BBC - in 2017 theydropped in on Radio 1and helped read the UK's Official Chart with Greg James.

Facebook accused of dark PR tacticsFacebook is embroiled in a new controversy over the tactics it used to discredit its critics.Technology,"Facebook faces a new controversy over alleged tactics it used to discredit its critics, embarrass rival firms and downplay problems at the company. TheNew York Times,externalhas published a wide-ranging account of the methods Facebook and a public relations firm used to ""deny and deflect"" criticism. The report has led US lawmakers to call for tighter regulation of social networks. Facebook has denied several of the claims. The New York Times report claimed Facebook: urged reporters to investigate whether there were financial links between billionaire George Soros, a prominent philanthropist, and an anti-Facebook movement tried to discredit anti-Facebook protesters as anti-Semitic ordered the publication of derogatory articles about rivals watered down posts about Russian election interference and was slow to act considered dragging rival companies into its controversies The newspaper said PR firm Definers had circulated a document suggesting Mr Soros was the hidden backer of anti-Facebook movement Freedom from Facebook. Facebook leaks take their toll The document encouraged journalists to explore the financial connections between anti-Facebook groups and Mr Soros, who is frequently the target of conspiracy theories and anti-Semitic smears. George Soros is often the target of anti-Semitic conspiracy theories Mr Soros's Open Society Foundations said it had not made any grants to support campaigns against Facebook. It said Facebook's behaviour was ""astonishing"". ""Your methods threaten the very values underpinning our democracy,"" said its president, Patrick Gaspard. Responding to the article,external, Facebook said it had wanted to show that Freedom From Facebook was ""not simply a spontaneous grassroots campaign"" and that the movement was ""supported by a well-known critic of our company"". It said any suggestion that it had been an anti-Semitic attack was ""reprehensible"". Chief executive Mark Zuckerberg later said that neither he nor chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg had been ""in the loop"" about Definers' actions and added that Facebook would no longer work with the firm. Sir Nick Clegg - the UK's former deputy prime minister who recently became Facebook's head of global policy - will oversee a review of the social network's use of other lobbyists and will report back on the matter to Ms Sandberg. Facebook has been criticised by privacy campaigners In July, protesters interrupted a House Judiciary Committee hearing where a Facebook executive was giving testimony. The protesters carried signs showing Mr Zuckerberg and Ms Sandberg as two heads of an octopus, wrapping its tentacles around the world. The New York Times said Facebook had called Jewish civil rights organisation the Anti-Defamation League and asked them to comment on the sign. Soon after, the ADL posted a statement calling the image an ""anti-Semitic trope"". Facebook has not responded to this claim. The ADL said it routinely responded to reports of anti-Semitic slurs and evaluated each one appropriately. According to the New York Times, Facebook executives were angry that its chief information security officer, Alex Stamos, had directed a team to investigate Russian election meddling without approval. It said Ms Sandberg had been worried that investigating the interference left Facebook ""exposed"" to legal action. The company ordered blog posts about election interference to be ""less specific"". The first blog post did not name Russia at all and the company ""stalled"" disclosing information for weeks. Facebook said it had not named Russia in a research paper about election meddling because it had felt the US intelligence services were ""best placed to determine the source"". The company said it had never discouraged its security experts from investigating election interference. The newspaper said Facebook was responsible for dozens of articles criticising Apple and Google for their business practices. The articles were published on conservative news site NTK Network, which shares staff and offices with PR firm Definers. The NTK website ran dozens of stories about Apple and Google While NTK itself does not have a large audience, its articles are often picked up by larger outlets such as Breitbart. Facebook said Mr Zuckerberg had been clear that he disagreed with Apple chief executive Tim Cook's criticisms of his company and there had been ""no need to employ anyone else"" to criticise Apple. It said Mr Zuckerberg and chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg had been ""deeply involved in the fight against false news"". In February 2018, Ms Sandberg publicly backed new legislation that would hold social networks accountable if they failed to tackle sex trafficking on their platforms. Other technology companies had been critical of the proposed law. According to the New York Times, Facebook felt backing the legislation would look positive and would win favour with law-makers. But Facebook said Ms Sandberg had backed the legislation because ""it was the right thing to do"". Sheryl Sandberg gave evidence to the Senate Intelligence Committee After a New York Times article revealed that Facebook had undeclared deals with phone-makers to share user data with them, the company set up focus groups to test how it should react. One approach it tested was arguing that Google had similar data-sharing deals with phone-makers. When asked to testify in front of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Facebook lobbied for the hearing to include a Google representative, the newspaper said. Google was asked to testify but did not show up. Many of the news headlines of the day focused on Google's empty chair. The report also said Facebook had urged staff to use only Android devices, after Apple's Tim Cook had criticised the social network. Facebook said it encouraged employees and executives to use Android because ""it is the most popular operating system in the world"". The newspaper also suggested Facebook had struggled to work out how to deal with a post made by Donald Trump in 2015, calling for a ban on Muslim immigration. ""To suggest that the internal debate around this particular case was different from other important free speech issues on Facebook is wrong,"" the company said in a blog post. The Wall Street Journal reported that morale at Facebook had fallen amid the ongoing scrutiny of the company. It said it had seen an internal survey taken by 29,000 employees that reported only half were ""optimistic"" about the company's future, a fall of 32 percentage points from the previous year. The Open Society Foundations president, Mr Gaspard, said Facebook had used tactics ""out of Putin's playbook"" that had ""no place in an important debate about the integrity of our elections"". Democratic congressman David Cicilline said in a post that ""Facebook cannot be trusted to regulate itself"". ""Facebook executives will always put their massive profits ahead of the interests of their customers,"" he said. ""Congress should get to work enacting new laws to hold concentrated economic power to account."" Facebook said it had ended its relationship with Definers and had never hidden its work with the consultancy. Definers has not yet responded to the BBC's request for comment. by Rory Cellan-Jones, technology correspondent We knew that Facebook's handling of its recent crises had been inept. Mark Zuckerberg's description of the idea that fake news put Donald Trump in the White House as ""crazy"" was a prime example. But now the New York Times has painted a startling picture not just of negligence and mismanagement by Facebook's leaders but of deeply questionable tactics as they fought to protect the image of their company. This new evidence of ethical failings will also embolden politicians and regulators around the world who want to clip Facebook's wings.

Brexit Q&A: Your questions answered,"What does the585-page Brexit withdrawal agreement,externalmean for you? BBC experts answer some of the most common questions you have sent us. Is there time for a renegotiation?@LonsYons Chris Morris, Reality Check correspondent replies: It would be difficult but not impossible: the rest of the EU would have to agree an extension of Article 50 - which they are not keen on. What is the chance of an European Economic Area (EEA)-European Free Trade Association (EFTA) deal?George Cazenove Chris Morris, Reality Check correspondent replies: Trouble with this is that no-one has really asked Norway and co if they really want the UK to crash their party. It sounds like a simple solution, but would actually be very complex. Then again, which proposal isn't? This video can not be played Brexit agreement: What does the 585-page document say? What is the likelihood of this deal being approved by all 27 other EU members?James Blackford Chris Morris, Reality Check correspondent replies: I think the other 27 would say yes if they thought the UK was committed to it. They've got plenty of other things to worry about other than Brexit. They want it sorted one way or another Live coverage: Theresa May and Brexit latest What does the draft withdrawal agreement reveal? Brexit: A guide to where we are What will it mean for British citizens' freedom of travel and rights to live & work on the continent?Henry Covey Daniel Sandford, Home affairs correspondent replies: The headline is freedom of movement ends after the transition period finishes in December 2020, but until then British citizens and their families will continue to have the right to move to live and work in the EU, and vice versa. Those who take up residence before the end of the transition period will be allowed to remain beyond transition and, if they stay for five years, will be allowed to remain permanently. However, once the transition period is over, the draft agreement does allow the EU to require UK citizens who stay on to apply for a new residence document. Will the UK be free to make trade deals with other countries?Peter Hodge Andrew Walker, Economics correspondent replies: The full answer is complicated. The short answer is: it looks like it would be difficult. First let's suppose we do end up activating the Northern Ireland backstop. That involves what the draft agreement calls a Single Customs Territory for the UK and the EU, which appears to be a customs union in all but name. In particular it says: ""Under no circumstances may the United Kingdom apply to its customs territory a customs tariff which is lower than the Common Customs Tariff (applied by the EU) for any good or import from any third country."" That rules out the bread and butter of trade agreements, negotiating the reduction or elimination of tariffs. It might still be possible to do deals on services and also investment, which is an area that has often been added on to trade agreements. If the backstop is not activated, then it depends on the shape of the agreement on the long-term relationship, which would be negotiated during the transition period. We have an outline of the political declaration intended to guide those negotiations, which says the ultimate deal should ""build on the single customs territory provided for in the Withdrawal Agreement"". On the face of it, that could run into the same difficulties as the backstop in terms of trade deals with other countries. If, however, it drops the prohibition on applying tariffs lower than the EU's, we would be in a position to negotiate conventional trade agreements with other countries. Please upgrade your browser What does the deal say about services, specifically regulations on UK financial services? Is there equivalence?Schwitt, London Andrew Walker, Economics correspondent replies: This is a question for the long term rather than the Withdrawal Agreement.  The outline political declaration doesn't make a general commitment that there will be equivalence granted but it does refer to it. The EU and UK can take ""equivalence decisions in their own interest"". The document calls for assessments of equivalence to start as soon as possible after Brexit and be completed by the end of the transition period. But I would emphasise this. It is just an outline to guide negotiations, not a definitive statement of where they will end. I am a UK national, living and studying within the EU, what impact would this have on me?Paul Blow, studying in Venlo in the Netherlands Sean Coughlan, Education correspondent replies: The future status of UK students in the EU and EU students in the UK still remains uncertain. Up to 2020, and during the transition period, not much would be expected to change. But the longer-term arrangements, about levels of tuition fees and access to student loans, have still to be decided. At present, EU and UK students are treated the same for fees in each other's countries - which has seen some UK students going to university in low-fee countries such as the Netherlands. But it will have to be negotiated whether there will be any reciprocal deals to replace this. What does the draft withdrawal agreement reveal? Will the EU still have access to UK waters and fish stocks?Stephen Knox Chris Morris, Reality Check correspondent replies: One policy area is excluded from these potential customs arrangements: fishing. That's because the trade-off between access for UK fish produce to EU markets, and access for EU boats to UK waters, is too controversial. The draft agreement simply states that ""the Union and the United Kingdom shall use their best endeavours to conclude and ratify"" an agreement ""on access to waters and fishing opportunities"". This video can not be played When will Brexit happen? Will the European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) continue to have the same validity for UK citizens visiting the EU as is currently does?John Jarvis Hugh Pym, Health Editor replies: UK citizens' rights to get healthcare in the EU and vice versa will be thrashed out during the transition period from March 2019 to December 2020. The Government has drawn up a Bill to spell this out but it wont have any force till the transition talks work out how it will all work.  If there is no deal things get a lot more complicated! The Reality Check team adds: During the transition period all EU law will continue to apply in the UK. That would mean that citizens would have exactly the same rights and guarantees as before - so, you'll still be able to use your card at least until the period ends.

EU warns of 'long road ahead' on Brexit,"Mr Barnier (L) formally hands the agreement to European Council head Donald Tusk The EU says much work still needs to be done on Brexit, despite agreeing a draft withdrawal document with the UK. ""We still have a long road ahead of us on both sides,"" chief negotiator Michel Barnier said. The EU has set out a series of meetings leading to one on 25 November where it plans to approve the Brexit agreement. UK Prime Minister Theresa May has won the backing of her cabinet but faces a tough task getting the agreement approved by Parliament. LIVE: Follow the Brexit story Brexit: A guide to where we are Watch: What is Brexit? A sign of that came on Thursday morning when Mr Barnier's UK counterpart,Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab, resignedsaying he could not ""in good conscience"" support the agreement. He was one of four ministers to quit. Mrs May later defended the deal in the House of Commons, telling MPs it delivered on the Brexit referendum and provided for an orderly withdrawal. Mr Barnier was speaking on Thursday morning alongside EU Council head Donald Tusk as the chief negotiator formally handed overthe 585-page draft withdrawal agreement.,external Mr Barnier said the agreement was fair and balanced, took into account the UK's needs and laid the ground for an ""ambitious new partnership"". Mr Tusk praised Mr Barnier's work and said the agreement had ""secured the interests of the 27 member states and EU as a whole"". He laid out the timetable for the days ahead. EU member states will analyse the document and at the end of the week national envoys will share their assessments A political declaration on future ties between the EU and the UK will be agreed by Tuesday and members will have 48 hours to evaluate it The EU Council will then meet on 25 November to finalise the agreement ""if nothing extraordinary happens"", Mr Tusk said. The leaders of the 27 EU nations must approve the deal Mr Tusk said: ""Since the very beginning, we have had no doubt that Brexit is a lose-lose situation, and that our negotiations are only about damage control."" Addressing the UK, he added: ""As much as I am sad to see you leave, I will do everything to make this farewell the least painful possible, for you and for us."" Pound dives after Brexit resignations Mr Barnier later took the document to the European Parliament. Its president, Antonio Tajani, said MEPs would vote on the deal in early 2019. If the agreement is approved by both sides, a 21-month transition period will kick in, during which a trade deal and the thorny issue of how to ensure there is no physical border between Northern Ireland - part of the UK - and the Republic of Ireland will need to be worked out. A smooth border-free exchange underpins the peace deal that ended the Northern Ireland conflict. The draft withdrawal agreement covers so-called ""divorce"" issues as the UK prepares to leave the EU. It includes a ""financial settlement"" from the UK, thought to be about Â£39bn (â¬45bn; $50bn). Speaking at a press briefing in Brussels on Wednesday, Mr Barnier addressed one of the major concerns of the divorce, the Irish ""hard border"" issue. He said that to avoid the need for physical checks on goods or infrastructure at the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, the EU would work with the UK to agree a trade deal. However if talks fail, the so-called ""backstop"" measure would be used. Q&A: Irish border backstop EU fears UK politics will scupper the deal Guide: Brexit and immigration Both sides have resolved to ensure the backstop is not necessary by coming up with alternative arrangements. Please upgrade your browser ""If we are not ready by 2020, we can extend the provision so we have more time, and if we are still not there with the future agreement after this, the backstop agreement would kick in,"" he said. ""There will be a UK-wide single customs territory which Northern Ireland will remain in, and Northern Ireland will remain aligned to the rules of a single market essential for avoiding a border including on agriculture policy."" The draft withdrawal agreement states that the transition period may be extended by mutual consent. What does the transition period mean? Mr Barnier said that any extension would by a one-off, ""by a limited period and by joint agreement"". During the transition, the UK will be out of the EU. It will have no voting rights but will continue to abide by the majority of its rules. There are also special protocols in place for Gibraltar and Cyprus to enable people there ""to continue to live as they do today"", Mr Barnier added. Spain has longstanding claims to the British Overseas Territory of Gibraltar and the deal sets out bilateral co-operation on customs, policing, trade, taxation and citizens' rights. The UK has sovereign military bases in Cyprus. EU law will continue to apply at the bases, with the deal securing the rights of the 11,000 Cypriot civilians working there. Analysis by BBC Europe editor, Katya Adler The EU knows there is a very real possibility the Brexit deal could be voted down by the UK Parliament in a few weeks' time. I put the question to Michel Barnier on Wednesday night at his press conference - but, skilled politician that he is, he refused to engage. Brussels is very keen indeed not to give the impression that the EU might change or come up with a ""better"" Brexit deal text if this one ends up being rejected in the House of Commons. Mr Barnier quoted Theresa May as saying that this is a deal in the UK's interest. Read more from Katya German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Thursday welcomed the draft agreement, saying: ""I am very happy that, after lengthy and not always easy negotiations, a proposal could be reached."" The European Parliament's Brexit chief Guy Verhofstadt said the deal had been hammered out after two years of ""intense negotiations"" and he hoped UK MPs would accept that ""there is not a lot of room [for] manoeuvre to say, 'OK, let's start again'"". French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said the deal was ""good news for the French economy"" but also issued caution, saying the UK must be made to respect all EU rules. Finland's Prime Minister Juha Sipila tweeted to say that while Wednesday's developments were important, ""decisions on both sides are still needed for a final agreement"". Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said he was ""very pleased"", adding: ""The result is a good one."" Brexit debate dominates Sunday interviews What is Brexit? VideoWhat is Brexit?

European media: Brexit hurdles still lie ahead,"Cabinet approval of the Brexit deal gains huge attention in the European newspapers, many of which went to press before Thursday morning's resignations from the British government. While most applaud Theresa May for securing her ministers' backing in the teeth of fierce argument, many newspapers anticipated the latest events by saying significant obstacles still barred her way forward. ""So the Brexit deal is over the line?"" asks theIrish Examiner,external. ""You must be joking. Everything relies on what happens in Britain and Northern Ireland, meaning the white smoke from Downing Street last night could just as easily be found tomorrow to be muffling, blinding fog."" The Irish Times says the UK ""will be worse off and will have less significant clout and influence"" The Irish Times,externaldeclares that Theresa May has ""taken the leap"". It says that the difficulty for her is that wherever this ends up, ""the UK will be worse off and will have less significant clout and influence. But that, unfortunately, is the inevitability of Brexit"". The prime minister ""wrested a deal from the EU and laboriously channelled it through her cabinet"", says Germany's left-liberal weeklyDer Spiegel,external, under the headline ""Another near escape."" ""It could have been worse for Theresa May. But the biggest hurdle is still ahead for the British prime minister,"" it says. That thought is echoed in centre-right dailyDie Welt,external, which warns that despite cabinet backing, the divorce deal ""is still at risk"". Resistance in both the Conservative Party and Parliament is enormous, the paper says, under the headline ""The real Brexit hurdle for Theresa May is yet to come."" Someone atDe Telegraaf,externalin the Netherlands appears to have actually read the text of the deal. ""After Brexit, little will change"" pronounces the popular centre-right daily, noting that ""there will be a transitional period of 21 months until late December 2020"". De Telegraaf says ""the nightmare scenario of a hard Brexit has not disappeared"" ""During that time, an agreement has to be made between the EU and the UK, but this period can be extended if necessary,"" it says. At the same time, ""everybody in Brussels knows that the nightmare scenario of a hard Brexit, bringing chaos and economic damage, has still not disappeared"".

""In view of the strong resistance in the cabinet against Brusselsâ¦ she cleverly played it so that her opponents had neither an alternative plan nor the time to work out one."" Le Figaro,externalin France suggests that if the cabinet meeting was tense, then the parliamentary battle to secure approval for the deal will be even tougher for Mrs May, with no majority for it so far. The centre-right daily adds that there's no majority among MPs either for a no-deal or for another referendum. Mrs May faces many obstacles, says France's centre-leftLe Monde,external, but she can count on ""the momentum provided by cabinet approval, on the fatigue of numerous Britons and, most of all, on the fear of chaos"".

Reality Check: What's in the agreement?,"This video can not be played The Brexit agreement summarised in two minutes The draft withdrawal agreement is all about how the UK leaves the European Union. It's not about any permanent future relationship. It's a long read - 585 pages long,external- and we've just had a first look at the text. There will be plenty more to say in the days ahead. But what's in this draft document, that some people thought might never materialise? Well we've known about a lot of the content for some time. There are details of the financial settlement (often dubbed the divorce bill) that the two sides agreed some months ago: over time, it means the UK will pay at least Â£39bn to the EU to cover all its financial obligations. There's also a long section on citizens' rights after Brexit for EU citizens in the UK and Brits elsewhere in Europe. It maintains their existing residency rights, but big questions remain about a host of issues, including the rights of UK citizens to work across borders elsewhere in the EU. The legal basis for a transition (or implementation) period, beginning after Brexit. It would be 21 months during which the UK would continue to follow all European Union rules (in order to give governments and businesses more time to prepare for long term change). That means that during transition, the UK would remain under the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice (in fact, the ECJ is mentioned more than 60 times in this document). The document says that decisions adopted by European Union institutions during this period ""shall be binding on and in the United Kingdom"". The transition period is also designed to allow time for the UK and the EU to reach a trade deal. The draft agreement says both sides will use their ""best endeavours"" to ensure that a long term trade deal is in place by the end of 2020. Significantly, if more time is needed, the option of extending the transition appears in the document (although, it makes it clear that the UK would have to pay for it). The document doesn't say how long the transition could be extended for (in fact they've left the date blank), only that the Joint Committee may take a decision ""extending the transition period up to [31 December 20XX]."" UK officials hope that the date will be clarified by the time of the proposed EU summit on 25 November. If there was no long term trade agreement and no extension of the transition, that's when the so-called ""backstop"" would kick in. It's the issue that has dominated negotiations for the last few weeks and months: how to ensure that no hard border (with checks or physical infrastructure) emerges after Brexit between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Both sides agreed back in December 2017 that there should be a guarantee to avoid a hard border under all circumstances. That guarantee came to be known as the backstop, but agreeing a legal text proved very difficult. So what exactly does this draft agreement say about the border, the backstop and the legal guarantees that underpin it? If a backstop is needed, it will - as expected - take the form of a temporary customs union encompassing not just Northern Ireland but the whole of the UK. The draft agreement describes this as a ""single customs territory"". Northern Ireland, though, will be in a deeper customs relationship with the EU than Great Britain, and even more closely tied to the rules of the EU single market. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. One policy area is excluded from these potential customs arrangements: fishing. That's because the trade-off between access for UK fish produce to EU markets, and access for EU boats to UK waters, is too controversial. The draft agreement simply states that ""the Union and the United Kingdom shall use their best endeavours to conclude and ratify"" an agreement ""on access to waters and fishing opportunities"". There are also details of one of the last issues to be negotiated - the terms on which the UK may be able to leave this temporary customs arrangement in the future. If either party notifies the other that it wants the backstop to come to an end, a joint ministerial committee will meet within six months to consider the details. But the backstop (which is part of the Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland) would only cease to apply if ""the Union and the United Kingdom decide jointly"" that it is no longer necessary. In other words, the UK will not have a unilateral right to bring those arrangements to an end. For some Brexiteers, that is simply unacceptable. A guide to where we are with Brexit But, don't forget, other countries will also have their concerns. They too will focus on the language surrounding a temporary customs union, to ensure that nothing is hidden there which could, in their view, give the UK rights without responsibilities; and - potentially - a competitive advantage. The EU insists the draft agreement ""includes the corresponding level playing field commitments and appropriate enforcement mechanisms to ensure fair competition between the EU27 and the UK."" So, it's not just in London that this document will be closely scrutinised. Finally one big question: to what extent could these temporary customs arrangements form the basis for a permanent future relationship, which can only be negotiated formally after Brexit has actually happened?

Premier League confirms Scudamore's Â£5m bonus,"Richard Scudamore joined the Premier League in November 1999 as chief executive before becoming executive chairman in June 2014 Outgoing executive chairman Richard Scudamore will receive a Â£5m farewell bonus paid by clubs, the Premier League has confirmed. Scudamore will receive the payment over a three-year period ""in recognition of his outstanding work"". He will remain with the Premier League in an advisory capacity. It comes after football fans urged clubs not to ""stick their hands down the back of the sofa"" and contribute to Scudamore's departing gift. Scudamore - who reportedly earns Â£2.5m per season - is stepping down in December after 19 years at the organisation. The Premier League's UK television rights were valued at about Â£670m when Scudamore joined the organisation in 1999, while the most recent deal was worth Â£5.14bn. All 20 Premier League clubs were asked by Chelsea chairman Bruce Buck for aÂ£250,000 contribution- something which fans ""strongly opposed"". ""Premier League clubs have always told fan groups that budgets are planned in advance and there's not a surplus of cash lying around from their extremely lucrative TV deal,"" said the Football Supporters' Federation (FSF). ""In the meantime, loyal football supporters continue to be inconvenienced by fixture changes to fit TV schedules, often losing out on travel costs or struggling to get to and from games in the first place. ""Now it appears clubs can stick their hands down the back of the sofa and find Â£250,000 at a moment's notice."" Speaking outside the meeting of all Premier League clubs on Thursday, Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy said: ""We are all very supportive [of the payment]. ""He has unique knowledge and experience which is going to be of ongoing benefit to the Premier League. It's absolutely a fair payment and all the clubs were behind it."" West Ham co-chairman David Gold said he backed the payment to Scudamore. ""He deserves everything he gets,"" Gold said. ""This is all very appropriate and we're all very pleased."" On Tuesday, the Premier League announced thatSusanna Dinnage will be its new chief executive. Dan Roan, BBC sports editor With the vast amounts of TV money swilling around Premier League football, the game has often been accused of a culture of greed. Whether it is the rising amounts spent on player wages, agents' fees, and managerial pay-offs, and controversy over a possible 'Big Six' breakaway, the proposed 39th game, ticket prices for away supporters, and clubs not paying staff a living-wage, to some the game resides in a bubble. But rarely before has there been outrage from fans quite like the one sparked by Scudamore's Â£5m pay-off. Perhaps that is partly down to the timing. The recent collapse of the sale of Wembley highlighted the poor state of the country's grassroots facilities, and the Football Leaks allegations last week against Manchester City were also damaging for the league's reputation. The majority of the clubs feel Scudamore's long and commercially successful tenure deserves to be rewarded, and point out that he will continue to advise them. But the bonus (and the fact that there was no vote called to give dissenting clubs a chance to oppose the payment) will still be viewed by many as a PR own-goal. One which overshadows the positive news of the appointment of the league's first female CEO this week, and which undermines public awareness of the clubs' investment in good causes, and it's global popularity.

Simon Jack: Three reasons markets have fallen,"The markets took a fright today as Theresa May's cabinet - and with it, her Brexit deal - appeared to be falling apart. Markets are a bit like bookmakers, they reflect the odds of certain outcomes, and three things have just become more likely than they were yesterday. Leaving the EU without a deal, a change of Prime Minister and a general election. All three scare investors. Here's why: Leaving the EU without a deal is widely considered bad for the UK economy - at least in the short to medium term - and that is bad for the pound. That hits people's incomes by pushing the price of imported goods and things priced in dollars (like petrol) higher. Cash-strapped consumers may find it harder to pay their loans, credit cards and mortgages, hence the big fall we have seen this morning in the shares of banks and housebuilders. Persimmon is down over 10% and Lloyds by more than 6%. The odds of a general election have just gone up and that means the possibility of a Corbyn government must have increased as well. Markets don't like the prospect of that, because of Labour's intention to raise taxes on companies and nationalise large sections of the economy. As for the day-to-day running of businesses, not a lot has changed this morning, as most companies had little faith that Theresa May's Brexit deal would get through Parliament. That lack of faith seems entirely vindicated by this morning's resignations, which have seen former ministers join the ranks of Labour, the DUP and 40 or so pro-Brexit Conservatives in intending to vote against it. One minister described the five-hour cabinet meeting to me last night as one of the most surreal experiences of his career. The picture of a briefly triumphant PM standing outside Number 10 last night did indeed feel like a dream this morning.

Facebook accused of dark PR tactics,"Facebook faces a new controversy over alleged tactics it used to discredit its critics, embarrass rival firms and downplay problems at the company. TheNew York Times,externalhas published a wide-ranging account of the methods Facebook and a public relations firm used to ""deny and deflect"" criticism. The report has led US lawmakers to call for tighter regulation of social networks. Facebook has denied several of the claims. The New York Times report claimed Facebook: urged reporters to investigate whether there were financial links between billionaire George Soros, a prominent philanthropist, and an anti-Facebook movement tried to discredit anti-Facebook protesters as anti-Semitic ordered the publication of derogatory articles about rivals watered down posts about Russian election interference and was slow to act considered dragging rival companies into its controversies The newspaper said PR firm Definers had circulated a document suggesting Mr Soros was the hidden backer of anti-Facebook movement Freedom from Facebook. Facebook leaks take their toll The document encouraged journalists to explore the financial connections between anti-Facebook groups and Mr Soros, who is frequently the target of conspiracy theories and anti-Semitic smears. George Soros is often the target of anti-Semitic conspiracy theories Mr Soros's Open Society Foundations said it had not made any grants to support campaigns against Facebook. It said Facebook's behaviour was ""astonishing"". ""Your methods threaten the very values underpinning our democracy,"" said its president, Patrick Gaspard. Responding to the article,external, Facebook said it had wanted to show that Freedom From Facebook was ""not simply a spontaneous grassroots campaign"" and that the movement was ""supported by a well-known critic of our company"". It said any suggestion that it had been an anti-Semitic attack was ""reprehensible"". Chief executive Mark Zuckerberg later said that neither he nor chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg had been ""in the loop"" about Definers' actions and added that Facebook would no longer work with the firm. Sir Nick Clegg - the UK's former deputy prime minister who recently became Facebook's head of global policy - will oversee a review of the social network's use of other lobbyists and will report back on the matter to Ms Sandberg. Facebook has been criticised by privacy campaigners In July, protesters interrupted a House Judiciary Committee hearing where a Facebook executive was giving testimony. The protesters carried signs showing Mr Zuckerberg and Ms Sandberg as two heads of an octopus, wrapping its tentacles around the world. The New York Times said Facebook had called Jewish civil rights organisation the Anti-Defamation League and asked them to comment on the sign. Soon after, the ADL posted a statement calling the image an ""anti-Semitic trope"". Facebook has not responded to this claim. The ADL said it routinely responded to reports of anti-Semitic slurs and evaluated each one appropriately. According to the New York Times, Facebook executives were angry that its chief information security officer, Alex Stamos, had directed a team to investigate Russian election meddling without approval. It said Ms Sandberg had been worried that investigating the interference left Facebook ""exposed"" to legal action. The company ordered blog posts about election interference to be ""less specific"". The first blog post did not name Russia at all and the company ""stalled"" disclosing information for weeks. Facebook said it had not named Russia in a research paper about election meddling because it had felt the US intelligence services were ""best placed to determine the source"". The company said it had never discouraged its security experts from investigating election interference. The newspaper said Facebook was responsible for dozens of articles criticising Apple and Google for their business practices. The articles were published on conservative news site NTK Network, which shares staff and offices with PR firm Definers. The NTK website ran dozens of stories about Apple and Google While NTK itself does not have a large audience, its articles are often picked up by larger outlets such as Breitbart. Facebook said Mr Zuckerberg had been clear that he disagreed with Apple chief executive Tim Cook's criticisms of his company and there had been ""no need to employ anyone else"" to criticise Apple. It said Mr Zuckerberg and chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg had been ""deeply involved in the fight against false news"". In February 2018, Ms Sandberg publicly backed new legislation that would hold social networks accountable if they failed to tackle sex trafficking on their platforms. Other technology companies had been critical of the proposed law. According to the New York Times, Facebook felt backing the legislation would look positive and would win favour with law-makers. But Facebook said Ms Sandberg had backed the legislation because ""it was the right thing to do"". Sheryl Sandberg gave evidence to the Senate Intelligence Committee After a New York Times article revealed that Facebook had undeclared deals with phone-makers to share user data with them, the company set up focus groups to test how it should react. One approach it tested was arguing that Google had similar data-sharing deals with phone-makers. When asked to testify in front of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Facebook lobbied for the hearing to include a Google representative, the newspaper said. Google was asked to testify but did not show up. Many of the news headlines of the day focused on Google's empty chair. The report also said Facebook had urged staff to use only Android devices, after Apple's Tim Cook had criticised the social network. Facebook said it encouraged employees and executives to use Android because ""it is the most popular operating system in the world"". The newspaper also suggested Facebook had struggled to work out how to deal with a post made by Donald Trump in 2015, calling for a ban on Muslim immigration. ""To suggest that the internal debate around this particular case was different from other important free speech issues on Facebook is wrong,"" the company said in a blog post. The Wall Street Journal reported that morale at Facebook had fallen amid the ongoing scrutiny of the company. It said it had seen an internal survey taken by 29,000 employees that reported only half were ""optimistic"" about the company's future, a fall of 32 percentage points from the previous year. The Open Society Foundations president, Mr Gaspard, said Facebook had used tactics ""out of Putin's playbook"" that had ""no place in an important debate about the integrity of our elections"". Democratic congressman David Cicilline said in a post that ""Facebook cannot be trusted to regulate itself"". ""Facebook executives will always put their massive profits ahead of the interests of their customers,"" he said. ""Congress should get to work enacting new laws to hold concentrated economic power to account."" Facebook said it had ended its relationship with Definers and had never hidden its work with the consultancy. Definers has not yet responded to the BBC's request for comment. by Rory Cellan-Jones, technology correspondent We knew that Facebook's handling of its recent crises had been inept. Mark Zuckerberg's description of the idea that fake news put Donald Trump in the White House as ""crazy"" was a prime example. But now the New York Times has painted a startling picture not just of negligence and mismanagement by Facebook's leaders but of deeply questionable tactics as they fought to protect the image of their company. This new evidence of ethical failings will also embolden politicians and regulators around the world who want to clip Facebook's wings.

Japan's cyber-minister 'never used computers',"Yoshitaka Sakurada said his lack of experience with computers should not pose a problem Japan's new cyber-security minister has dumbfounded his country by saying he has never used a computer. Yoshitaka Sakurada made the admission to a committee of lawmakers. ""Since I was 25 years old and independent I have instructed my staff and secretaries. I have never used a computer in my life,"" he said, according to a translationby the Kyodo news agency,external. The 68-year-old was appointed to his post last month. His duties include overseeing cyber-defence preparations for the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo. Tokyo 2020: Japan debates daylight saving to avoid heat Tokyo 2020 Olympic mascots unveiled after children's vote A politician from the opposition Democratic Party, Masato Imai, whose question had prompted the admission, expressed surprise. ""I find it unbelievable that someone who is responsible for cyber-security measures has never used a computer,"" he said. But Mr Sakurada responded that other officials had the necessary experience and he was confident there would not be a problem. However, his struggle to answer a follow-up question about whether USB drives were in use at the country's nuclear power stations caused further concern. The disclosure has been much discussed on social media where the reaction has been a mix of astonishment and hilarity, with some noting that at least it should mean Mr Sakurada would be hard to hack.

Plan to pedestrianise centre of Paris,"Parts of central Paris - including the area around the Notre Dame Cathedral - could be closed to traffic The Mayor of Paris has plans to pedestrianise the centre of the French capital, which includes landmarks such as Notre Dame Cathedral, reports say. The plans would severely restrict traffic in the city's first four districts, known as arrondissements, with electric shuttles brought in as an alternative, AFP reported. It would happen in Mayor Anne Hidalgo's next term, assuming she is re-elected. She has made reducing pollution a central part of her policy. Last monththe European Environment Agency warned that air pollution caused 500,000 premature deathsin Europe every year. Things Indians do to beat pollution UK pollution hotspots revealed - check your area London pollution 'stunts child lung capacity' Traffic is currently limited in the central arrondissements on one Sunday a month. Ms Hidalgo also says she wants to expand this scheme - known as ""Paris breathes"" - to every Sunday by next year. The mayor, who took office in 2014, has not yet announced whether she will stand for re-election. Traffic is currently restricted in the central area one Sunday a month On Wednesday Ms Hidalgo saidthe arrondissements themselves proposed full pedestrianisation,externalbased on feedback from residents, Cnews reported. Initial proposals for full pedestrianisation will be presented at council sessions in each of the four arrondissements next week, reports say. Members of Ms Hidalgo's team told Cnews that the combined area to be pedestrianised was ""small and sufficiently served by public transport"" for the scheme to work. However some have criticised the proposal. Dominique ReyniÃ©, a professor at the prestigious Sciences-Po university, tweeted that Paris was ""closing in on itself in a kind of appropriation to the benefit of a small group of people who have been persuaded to have an ecologist outlook"".

Eight-pack 'proof' of Michelangelo work,"The Rothschild bronzes depict two muscular male nudes riding on panthers ""Eight-pack"" stomachs carved into two sculptures led researchers to confirm the works as the only known surviving bronzes cast by Michelangelo. A worldwide team led by the University of Cambridge confirmed the attribution after four years of research. The 1m-high (3.2ft) works depict two muscular male nudes riding on panthers. In 2002 they were sold by Sotheby's for Â£1,821,650, but if the Michelangelo evidence is accepted they could be worth hundreds of millions. Last year, Leonardo da Vinci's Salvatore Mundi sold for $450m (Â£350m) and confirmed works by Michelangelo would have valuers dreaming of such huge numbers. The sculptures, known as the Rothschild bronzes, are believed to have been created after Michelangelo's marble masterpiece David, and before he began painting the elaborate Sistine Chapel ceiling fresco between 1508 and 1512. Dr Victoria Avery, Keeper of Applied Arts at the Fitzwilliam Museum, said Michelangelo created works with anatomical features which were specific to him. These included ""an extra tendinous intersection, which is in fact a band of fibrous tissue that converts a six-pack into an eight or a ten-pack"". The non-matching pair share details known to be specific to Michelangelo's works In the 19th Century the bronzes were thought to be by the Renaissance master, but that theory was later dismissed and they were attributed to the Dutch sculptor Willem Danielsz van Tetrode. By 2014, Paul Joannides from the University of Cambridge hadlinked them to a tiny detail,externalin a 16th Century copy of lost sketches by Michelangelo held in the Musee Fabre in Montpellier, France. The Fitzwilliam Museumpresented a case for the reattributionin February 2015 based on historical, technical and anatomical evidence. Dr Avery also studied 30 letters written by the artist to his family at the time he was crafting a colossal bronze statue of Pope Julius II in Bologna. He wrote of the ""trials and tribulations of an artist learning on the job"", she said, and creating the smaller bronzes would have provided ""light relief"". The letters showed the artist was involved in all stages of the production of his bronzes, not only making the original models but also preparing moulds and undertaking the finishing work, according to researchers. The attribution of the bronzes would see their value far eclipse the Â£1.8m sale price last time they were auctioned Scientists in Switzerland used neutron analysis to date the pieces to Michelangelo's era, while Prof Peter Abrahams, a clinical anatomist at Warwick University, found they bore a number of the artist'sanatomical quirksincluding toe-spacing, the eight-pack and bulging thigh and calf muscles. Giant suffragette selfie mosaic revealed Mystery hedge cutter strikes at night British snapper's flash photo wins prize Dr Avery said: ""We know the public can be cynical when you have no documentary evidence, but were more likely to believe the science. ""They are authentic Michelangelo, made when he was at the height of his creative genius, when he was desperate to outdo his contemporaries and dominate every medium on a massive scale."" No paperwork exists on the sculptures before 1878 when they were bought by the Rothschild dynasty from a Venetian noble family for between 250,000 and 300,000 gold francs. They are now with private owners in London but are expected to be loaned around the world. Michelangelo is believed to have cast the bronze figures after he created David in marble... ... and before he painted the Sistine Chapel ceiling Michelangelo's other known bronzes - including the papal statue - were melted down to create cannons and weapons during the French Revolution, Dr Avery said. ""Until now this significant part of his career has been neglected,"" she added. ""We know he was great but these four years of work have proved he pushed boundaries, he got his hands dirty. ""Where artists shied away from this alchemical material, he embraced it like no-one else of his generation. ""They add lustre to someone we already know was a supreme creative genius."" The research is the subject of a new book, Michelangelo: Sculpture in Bronze, which charts his relatively undocumented career as a sculptor.

Monkey kills baby boy in Indian city,"Monkeys in India face growing environmental as well as human pressures A 12-day-old boy has died after he was snatched from his mother and bitten by a monkey in northern India. The infant's mother was breastfeeding him at their home in the city of Agra when the animal entered the house and grabbed him, the family said. The monkey dropped the badly bitten child on a neighbour's roof after locals gave chase to the animal. The baby died of his injuries in hospital. Locals say monkey attacks in the area are growing more frequent. The baby's uncle, Dhirendra Kumar, told the BBC that the family was heartbroken. ""There are too many monkeys in the area. We live in fear. We have told the administration so many times to help us but they haven't done anything. The mother of the baby is too distraught to even speak,"" he said. Pushpa Devi, the child's grandmother said the family would ""never recover"" from the loss. Pushpa Devi, the baby's grandmother, told the BBC that people are living in fear of monkeys ""I have lost my grandson. Just a few hours before the monkey attacked our baby, I had him in my arms. Our baby didn't have to die. People will talk about it for a while and then forget it. But we have to live with the reality that our baby is gone,"" she said. Ajay Kaushal, the officer in charge of the nearby police station, told the Reuters news agency that the baby had been badly mauled. ""The monkey bit the infant's head and only dropped him when people chased it with sticks and threw stones at it,"" he said This is the latest incident in a series of monkey attacks in Agra, which is also home to India's most famous monument, the Taj Mahal. Two months earlier, a toddler was attacked by monkeys and is recovering in hospital. Thieving monkey hands out money Rampaging monkeys become election issue in India In May, two tourists were attacked at the Taj Mahal. ""Monkeys are everywhere in Agra,"" Shravan Kumar Singh, a local environmental activist told Reuters. Locals say monkeys can be seen on almost every street in Agra ""They come in search of food, but they snatch and attack as well."" Mr Singh said monkeys were becoming more aggressive as a result of being displaced from their natural habitats, which have been destroyed by the expanding city. Some local organisations have been calling for monkeys to be sterilised and excluded from wildlife protection legislation, he added.

Richard Bacon says he suffered PTSD,"Richard Bacon has revealed he experienced PTSD when he revisited the hospital where he almost died. The presenter had to be put in a medical coma in Lewisham Hospital, after being taken ill on a flight to the UK in July. The 42-year-old revisited the hospital for an immigration documentary for ITV. ""I was standing on the ward looking at the equipment I was hooked up to, with wires coming out of everywhere. I felt PTSD on the ward that day, for sure."" He returned to find out what role migration played in his care but toldThe Sun,externalwhen the cameras stopped rolling he felt overwhelmed. ""Memories were coming back to me of bleak moments and frightening moments, like when I came out of the coma and I was hallucinating and thoughts about what my wife, Rebecca, would have done if I died,"" Bacon said, in quotes confirmed by his agent to the BBC. Bacon, who lives in Los Angeles, was taken ill on a flight from the US to the UK with suspected pneumonia. After his condition worsened he was put into a coma to allow his body to fight the infection. Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

Pound dives after Brexit resignations,"The pound and shares in housebuilders and banks have fallen sharply after cabinet ministers Dominic Raab and Esther McVey quit over Prime Minister Theresa May's draft Brexit deal. Royal Bank of Scotland sank 9%, with 7% falls for Persimmon, Taylor Wimpey and Barratt Developments. Sterling fell 1.7% against the dollar and 1.9% against the euro. The FTSE 100 index closed little moved, but the FTSE 250, which mainly comprises UK-focused firms, fell 1.6%. Capita topped the fallers in the FTSE 250, plunging 14%, with Countryside Properties down 9%. Shares in companies that do most or all of their business in the UK reflected the continued political uncertainty, as members of the Conservative Party and opposition politicians voiced their scepticism over the draft deal. ""The market has taken a big red pen to stocks which are heavily exposed to the UK economy like the banks, retailers and housebuilders,"" said Laith Khalaf at Hargreaves Lansdown. ""These sectors were already under pressure, but the potential for an orderly Brexit to unravel in the next few days is causing further distress to be manifested in share prices."" BBC business editor Simon Jack said:""The odds of a general election have just gone up and that means the possibility of a Corbyn government must have increased as well. ""Markets don't like the prospect of that because of Labour's intention to raise taxes on companies and nationalise large sections of the economy."" The higher chances of an election was one of the reasons behind RBS' steep fall, as the Labour Party has said it would nationalise the lender. However, shares in other banks also fell, as investors considered the threat to the economy and therefore to banks' balance sheets if the UK were to leave the EU without a deal. Sterling ended the day in London at under $1.28 against the dollar after a turbulent day's trading. Initially on Wednesday, when Theresa May announced she had secured cabinet backing for the draft Brexit agreement with Brussels, the pound recovered earlier lost ground. But by Thursday morning it was already wavering. A string of ministerial resignations led by Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab and Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey, undermined confidence in the pound further as market observers deemed the chances of a disorderly Brexit had risen. The Brexit process has been punctuated by big movements in the pound's relationship with the dollar, something which can lead to big gains or losses for investors. In the run-up to, and immediate aftermath of the Brexit referendum on 23 June 2016, for example, the pound hit a peak of volatility against the dollar. And as the graphic below shows, the events surrounding Wednesday's draft agreement has triggered the greatest volatility for sterling since the referendum. Jane Foley at Rabobank said the pound's plunge was ""firmly tied"" to the perception that Mrs May will have difficulty in pushing the Brexit plan through Parliament. She said the resignations had increased speculation that the prime minister would face a no-confidence vote, something that would weigh heavily on the pound: ""Any turn of events that could raise the risk of a general election would also punish the pound, given the risk of a market-unfriendly far-left government."" Chris Turner at ING said Mr Raab's resignation had increased the chances of a leadership challenge and a no-deal Brexit. He said the pound ""could fall another 3-4% unless the threat of a leadership election is quashed or there are clearer signs that the withdrawal agreement can garner more support in parliament"". Organisations that speak on behalf of business like the Confederation of British Industry welcomed the draft deal, because it offered the prospect of a smooth path towards Brexit. The CBI described the agreement as a ""compromise, including for business"" but was happy that it represented a ""step back from the cliff-edge"". The agreement includes a 21-month transition period, during which time the UK will negotiate new trade terms with the EU. The UK would have a unilateral right to extend that transition period, which was described as ""very positive for business"" by James Stewart, head of Brexit at KPMG. Northern Ireland also has the guarantee of a ""friction-free"" customs border with the Republic of Ireland. CBI Director-general Carolyn Fairbairn told the BBC: ""There is a possible path to frictionless trade now in terms of negotiating the final deal. I don't think anyone thinks the transition or the backstop is the answer, so this has to be used as a route to a final deal with frictionless trade and access for services."" Of course not. Pro-Brexit economist Gerard Lyons, chief economic strategist at Netwealth Investment and former chief economic adviser to Boris Johnson while he was Mayor of London, says the draft withdrawal deal is not something to cheer about. ""Whilst it has avoided the cliff edge, I think it's important we don't bury our heads in the sands here and view this as a 'good' deal - this is still disappointing,"" he said. Those who had hoped the draft deal would supply some reassurance will also be disappointed as Theresa May wrestles with critics and struggles to unite enough MPs behind her plan.

Lovers tried many ways to kill husband,"Ray Weatherall was shot in the face in one of the murder attempts A wife plotted with her lover and his daughter to kill her terminally ill husband by poisoning him and shooting him in the face. Ray Weatherall survived a number of attempts on his life, including a swimming pool heater explosion which left him with second degree burns His wife Hayley Weatherall, 32, also planned to kill him using sleeping tablets and insulin. A jury at Maidstone Crown Court found her guilty of conspiracy to murder. Her lover Glenn Pollard, 49, and his daughter Heather, 20, were also convicted of the same charge. The court heard Mr Weatherall, 53, was told by doctors in early 2016 he had just 18 months to live. Jurors were told his wife had been having an affair with Pollard, who was her husband's best friend, and they planned to have a new life together. Prosecutor Simon Taylor said there had been a series of plots on Mr Weatherall's life, including the swimming pool explosion and the poison plan. The court heard there was an aborted plan by Glenn Pollard to push Mr Weatherall overboard during a fishing trip in a boat they co-owned. On 29 November last year Mr Weatherall was shot in the face at Sandwich Marina, but survived when the bullet hit his right cheekbone. The conspiracy only came to light when Heather Pollard's car was found to have been near the marina at the time of the shooting. The court heard both the Pollards had access to guns, with Glenn a registered owner of a rifle found to be consistent with firing the ""sniper"" shot. Heather Pollard, described as a ""devoted"" daughter, also carried out internet searches on the best ways to kill somebody and not get caught, the court heard. Weatherall, from Ash near Canterbury, and Glenn and Heather Pollard, of Church Lane in West Stourmouth, Canterbury, will be sentenced on Tuesday.

Mild autumn hits retail sales in October,"Retail sales fell by a worse-than-expected 0.5% in October, after a mild autumn hit sales of winter clothes. Sales at household goods stores also fell 3% following a particularly strong August and September,the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.,external For the three months to October, retail sales rose 0.4% - a considerable slowdown from the 2.3% increase recorded for the three months to July. Analysts said October's fall suggested shoppers were cutting back spending. Samuel Tombs at Pantheon Macroeconomics said the drop was the ""first real sign that consumers are tightening their purse strings due to uncertainty about Brexit"". Non-food sales fell 1.3%, with a 1% decline in clothing sales, which he said could not be blamed on the weather. UK inflation holds steady at 2.4% Wages show fastest rise in almost a decade ""Consumers' confidence already has weakened in recent months due to concerns about the economic outlook and we doubt households are feeling any surer that a no-deal Brexit will be avoided after this week's political turbulence,"" Mr Tombs said. ""Unless the government miraculously manages to force the current withdrawal agreement through parliament soon, growth in consumers' spending will weaken markedly in the fourth quarter."" Thomas Pugh at Capital Economics said some of October's weakness may reflect consumers delaying spending ahead of ""Black Friday"" discounting this month. ""High oil prices also weighed on the volume of fuel sold. As such, we suspect that there could be a rebound in sales volumes in November as oil prices have fallen sharply and if Black Friday sales pick up,"" he added. The Christmas quarter accounts for a big proportion of profits for most retailers and is set to be very tough. Ian Geddes, head of retail at Deloitte, said more than half of consumers do their Christmas shopping in November or earlier. ""Given consumers' appetite to rein in their spending, the promotions on and around Black Friday will likely be more of a draw than ever,"" he said. ""We expect this year's Black Friday to generate record levels of UK spending, which will likely boost November's retail figures overall. Whether it will be enough to make this a 'golden' quarter remains to be seen."" It is difficult to say with any certainty, as sterling had already started sliding on Thursday morning following the resignation of Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab over Theresa May's draft Brexit deal before the retail sales figures were released. The pound fell as low as $1.2751 following the departure of Esther McVey, the Work and Pensions Secretary, before recovering some ground to trade at about $1.28 and â¬1.1318 - both falls of 1.5%. Jeremy Thomson-Cook, chief economist at WorldFirst, said: ""All eyes are now on Theresa May with a challenge to her leadership increasingly being viewed as the next catalyst for another sterling collapse."" Earlier this week the ONS said inflation was steady at 2.4% last month, despite expectations of a modest rise. Prices of food and clothing fell, but utility bills and petrol prices were up, said the ONS. Separate ONS figures suggested that the squeeze on consumers' wallets is easing slightly, as wage growth outstrips inflation. In the three months to September, wages excluding bonuses rose by 3.2% compared with a year earlier - the biggest rise since the end of 2008.

Doctor Who to skip Christmas Day,"Jodie Whittaker's Doctor can currently be seen on Sunday nights The festive edition of Doctor Who will be shown on New Year's Day on BBC One instead of Christmas Day for the first time since the drama's return in 2005. It will be the first Doctor Who episode to debut on 1 January since the second part of David Tennant's series exit aired on the first day of 2010. Executive producer Chris Chibnall said it would see Jodie Whittaker's Doctor ""face a terrifying alien threat"". The current series - Whittaker's first - will conclude on 9 December. ""We're thrilled to be starting the New Year with a bang on BBC One,"" said Chibnall, who promised audiences ""an action-packed, hour-long special adventure for all the family"". Mark Addy (centre) guest stars in the final episode of the current series Charlotte Moore, the BBC's director of content, said: ""We're delighted the Doctor and her companions will be welcoming BBC One audiences into 2019 with this exciting new episode."" According to the BBC, the seasonal instalment will involve ""a terrifying evil... from across the centuries of Earth's history"". By entertainment correspondent, Lizo Mzimba The confirmation that Doctor Who is to move from its traditional Christmas Day slot is in some ways surprising. It's a day when BBC One likes to display many of the programmes it regards as its crown jewels. Then again, it's a move that mirrors the programme's shift from Saturday to Sunday - a scheduling change that has seen significantly bigger audiences for Jodie Whittaker's Doctor. New Year's Day is a day that in recent years has often delivered bigger ratings than Christmas Day with shows like Sherlock. A 1 January broadcast for Doctor Who will help it to stand out more, instead of just being one of a number of family favourites fighting for viewers on 25 December. One other possible factor could be that a New Year's Day episode guarantees 2019 won't be a totally Doctor Who-free year, as it now looks unlikely Jodie Whittaker's second series will air before 2020. It's never been explicitly or officially stated that there would be a new set of adventures every year, and the BBC isn't commenting on exactly when the next series will be transmitted. But it's understandable that many expected they'd want to maintain the momentum built up by Whittaker's successful relaunch by echoing the early tenures of David Tennant, Matt Smith and Peter Capaldi and having a new run of stories around a year after their debut series. Yet while the absence of a 2019 set of episodes would disappoint many, in a changing TV landscape it's not uncommon for event shows such Game of Thrones to have gaps longer than 12 months between some series. The whispers I've heard coming out of the Tardis are that while there's a recognition that fans might want a series every single year, Doctor Who has almost uniquely complex filming requirements and a lengthy post-production period. The team behind it are adamant that the most important thing is for the show to be 100% and not have its quality compromised by squeezing that process in order to meet a particular transmission pattern. The Christmas Day edition of Doctor Who has been a TV fixture since Christopher Eccleston ushered in the show's current era. Kylie Minogue, David Morrissey, Katherine Jenkins and Sir Michael Gambon are among the stars who have appeared in previous festive specials. Peter Capaldi (centre) bowed out of Doctor Who in last year's Christmas episode Whittaker's first full episode attracted a record audience for a new Doctor - 10.9 million viewers - last month. The actress was first seen in her new role at the end of Twice Upon A Time, last year's Christmas special and the last episode to feature her predecessor, Peter Capaldi.

White House aide removed after Melania row,"Mira Ricardel (left) and Melania Trump (right) White House Deputy National Security Adviser Mira Ricardel has left her post, following a high-profile row with US First Lady Melania Trump. A White House spokeswoman said Mrs Ricardel ""departs the White House to transition to a new role within the administration"". She did not elaborate. Mrs Trump this week said that Mrs Ricardel ""no longer deserves the honour of serving in this White House"". The two reportedly feuded during a tour of Africa in October. In pictures: Melania Trump's whistle-stop Africa tour The removal of Mrs Ricardel comes amid reports in US media that President Donald Trump is considering a shake-up in the White House West Wing. Mr Trump may be preparing to remove White House Chief of Staff John Kelly or Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, the reports say. The announcement of the transfer of Mrs Ricardel was made in a statement by White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders on Wednesday. The spokeswoman added that Mrs Ricardel ""will continue to support the president"". According to US media reports earlier this week, Mrs Trump and Mrs Ricardel quarrelled over seating arrangements on her plane. During her trip there, Mrs Trump told ABC in a rare interview that there were people in the White House who she does not trust. She said she gave the president ""my honest advice and honest opinions and then he does what he wants to do"". The Wall Street Journal had earlier reported that Mrs Trump's team believed Mrs Ricardel was behind some of the ""negative stories"" about Mrs Trump and her staff. The newspaper also reported that she repeatedly clashed with US Secretary of Defense James Mattis over ""staffing decisions and policy differences"". Mrs Ricardel was hired away from the Department of Commerce by National Security Advisor John Bolton, and has decades of experience working in the US government. She had earlier worked in the defence department under former President George W Bush as well as under Republican Senator Bob Dole when he served as the Senate Majority Leader.

Parents spending heavily on mystery toys,"Collectables like this have seen speedy sales growth Parents are spending heavily on mystery toys as a craze in wrapped-up collectables is set to dominate Christmas sales. Sales of collectable toys - such as the L.O.L. range - have risen by 30% in the year so far, compared with the same period of 2017. They now account for three in 10 of toys sold, analysts say. The sector is banking, in part, on their success after a difficult year following the collapse of Toys R Us. Five reasons Toys R Us failed Age: 43. Hobby: Lego. Rise of the middle-aged toy fans The British toy market has dipped by 5% in the first nine months of the year, compared with the 2017 equivalent, according to sector analysts NPD. Spending on Christmas toys totals Â£110 per child up to the age of 11, down from Â£121 a year ago. ""This year has been more challenging than any other in my 20 years of studying the industry,"" said NPD's global analyst, Frederique Tutt. Toys R Us, which held about 10% of the UK toy market, collapsed early in the year. In March, it was announced thatall 100 UK stores would closetheir doors, with the loss of 3,000 jobs. The pre-closure discounts and then the retailer's disappearance had hit the sector's bottom line, Ms Tutt said. The only comparable ""game changer"" in recent years was the loss of Woolworths on the High Street, she said. Children aged up to 11 typically receive 10 toys at Christmas More than half (59%) of toy spending for Christmas was on gifts chosen by the giver, rather than from children's wishlists, compared with 39% in Europe Christmas sales account for 34% of annual spending on toys and total Â£1.2bn Some 61% of toy sales were made in stores About 40% of a typical child's toy collection is renewed every year Source: NPD Group Gary Grant, chairman of the Toy Retailers' Association Dream Toys selection committee - which has chosen itstop 12 toys for Christmas,external- said that the remaining retailers had done relatively well after the Toys R Us collapse. He said that the toy industry bucked the trend of the High Street, with new stores being opened. Parents, grandparents and children were drawn to toy shops to see and try products, rather than ""looking at a picture of the box"" on the internet, he said. He said the industry was hoping for a rebound in 2019 on the back of some major film releases, such as the Lego and Toy Story movies. Franchised toys have traditionally done well following their previous films. This video can not be played What do toymakers think will be the must-haves this Christmas? However, the current craze has been ranges such as L.O.L. Surprise - the biggest seller of the year so far. Inspired by ""unboxing"" videos on sites such as You Tube, the product comes with layers of wrapping before the child reaches the mystery toy inside. There are various toys to collect. Their popularity may be exasperating for parents who, like the children, have no idea which wrapped-up character they have bought. Launched in April last year by privately-owned MGA Entertainment, the creators of the Bratz dolls, with no TV advertising, the level of success of L.O.L. was a surprise to the company itself, according to its managing director in the UK, Andrew Laughton. He said the toy built on the tradition of pass-the-parcel games, but the latest versions hit all the trends in toys, ranging from slime to unicorns. The range of prices has grown too, with the most simple collectables costing Â£3.99, but the most elaborate costing Â£179.99. Ms Tutt said parents might be tempted to look at videos of these products on social media as well, to find out exactly what they are getting for their money. Age: 43. Hobby: Lego.

One million fly-tipping incidents in a year,"Almost one million crimes of fly-tipping were reported by councils across England during 2017-18, the first fall in five years. Councils recorded 997,553 incidents of illegal dumping, an average of more than 2,700 a day. It was a slight decrease on the 1,011,000 in 2016-17 and  is the first time the figure has dropped since 2013. The government said two-thirds of fly-tipping involved household waste. It did not reveal the total cost to taxpayers of clearing fly-tipped rubbish, saying the estimates were ""outdated"". The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said 69,000 fixed penalties were issued during 2017-18, a 20% rise on the previous year. Councils were given the power to issue on the spot fines of up to Â£400 to fly-tippers in 2016. The government is planning to extend fines to householders who pay someone else to take their rubbish away, if it is then fly-tipped. The change is expected to take effect by the end of the year but a date has not yet been set. Used syringes in play areas and car parks London pollution 'stunts lung capacity' Hotel's huge gorilla roof statue stolen Rates of tipping varied across England. In Hammersmith and Fulham there were 18,652 incidents, equivalent to about one for every 10 people living in the London borough. However, a spokesman said the council had made it easier for people to report fly-tipping via a mobile phone app and was ""ruthlessly efficient"" at removing rubbish. ""These figures just don't reflect reality,"" he said. ""Independent surveys recently showed our streets are the cleanest they've ever been."" Javed Iqbal from Birmingham clears fly-tipped rubbish off the streets In Birmingham, fly-tipping was up 8% on the year before. The Alum Rock Community Forum has been advising residents of how to contact the city council and report fly-tipping, but also remove bags of rubbish and other dumped waste themselves. Javed Iqbal from Bordesley Green chairs the forum and said: ""This is about a lack of respect for the area and a lack of education. There's no excuse for it. ""We've taken van-loads of waste to the Birmingham tips and it's easy and free. They're open every day."" Campaigners in Birmingham put fly-tipping down to a lack of respect Father-of-three Mr Iqbal said the threat of fines was not a deterrent. ""It's difficult to trace people because most people don't leave their name and address with their rubbish. Unless we empower people to take pride again, nothing will change."" Gary Palin from Crewe starteda Facebook group,externalfor people to highlight fly-tipping. It now has more than 1,000 members. The 39-year-old lorry driver said he thinks councils need more powers and to be willing to use them. ""There will be lots of opinions on this but I think for most people it's simply find out who's doing it and stop them,"" he said. ""A knock on the door from a council officer and an informal chat would be enough to change their behaviour. Unfortunately some people will only learn if it hits their pocket."" He also suggested councils dispose of bulky items for free for people who could not afford the charges. Authorities are trying different methods to encourage people to throw away bulky waste responsibly. Walsall Council is planning toput a free skip in each of its 20 wardsevery Saturday. The area recorded 4,367 incidents of fly-tipping in 2017-18, a slight drop on the year before. Councillor Martin Tett from the Local Government Association said fly-tipping was ""unsightly and unacceptable environmental vandalism"". ""New fixed penalty notice powers from the government will help but every single conviction for more serious fly-tipping offences still results in council taxpayers having to pick up the bill,"" he said. ""Manufacturers can also contribute, by providing more take-back services so people can hand in old furniture and mattresses when they buy new ones.""

Royal Mail profits more than halve,"Half-year profits at Royal Mail have tumbled after the company failed to cut costs as quickly as hoped. Pre-tax profit more than halved to Â£33m for the six months to 23 September despite a 1% rise in revenues to just over Â£4.9bn. Revenue from its GLS European parcel operations was up 9%, offsetting a 1% fall in the UK parcels and letters. Chief executive Rico Back said Royal Mail had put a ""range of actions"" in place to improve performance. ""There will be a greater emphasis on how we connect customers, companies and countries through our domestic and international businesses. There will be a clearer focus on financial performance and management accountability,"" he said. Growth in online shopping helped drive a 6% rise in revenues for the UK parcels business, but total revenue from letters was down 7%. Adjusted pre-tax profit was down 27% to Â£183m. Royal Mail warned on profits at the start of Octoberin an unscheduled update after revealing that cost savings would be just Â£100m this year rather than the Â£230m forecast, sending shares down almost a fifth. The company reiterated its commitment to the Â£100m target for the 2018-19 financial year and Mr Back said the management team was ""focused on pulling all the short and medium-term levers at our disposal to improve our performance"". It said it would update investors on its strategy in March next year. ""This is a great company with great brands. We have, by far, the best delivery network in the UK: our ability to deliver most of our letters and parcels together is a major asset,"" said Mr Back, who took over from Moya Green as chief executive earlier this year. ""Royal Mail has been in existence in one form or another for over 500 years. We have transformed ourselves many times before."" However, analysts at Liberum said the firm faced ""significant structural challenges with little visibility on how the business might be turned around"". They maintained a ""sell"" recommendation on the shares with a target price of just 250p. After initially rising, Royal Mail's shares fell 3% to 338p on Thursday. The shares have nearly halved since peaking at 632p in May, prompting some Royal Mail staff toclaim they have been short-changed. Some 145,000 postal workers have waited five years to sell the free shares they were given at the time of privatisation without being taxed. The shares were priced at 330p when the company floated.

Reality Check: What does draft agreement reveal?,"This video can not be played The Brexit agreement summarised in two minutes The draft withdrawal agreement is all about how the UK leaves the European Union. It's not about any permanent future relationship. It's a long read - 585 pages long,external- and we've just had a first look at the text. There will be plenty more to say in the days ahead. But what's in this draft document, that some people thought might never materialise? Well we've known about a lot of the content for some time. There are details of the financial settlement (often dubbed the divorce bill) that the two sides agreed some months ago: over time, it means the UK will pay at least Â£39bn to the EU to cover all its financial obligations. There's also a long section on citizens' rights after Brexit for EU citizens in the UK and Brits elsewhere in Europe. It maintains their existing residency rights, but big questions remain about a host of issues, including the rights of UK citizens to work across borders elsewhere in the EU. The legal basis for a transition (or implementation) period, beginning after Brexit. It would be 21 months during which the UK would continue to follow all European Union rules (in order to give governments and businesses more time to prepare for long term change). That means that during transition, the UK would remain under the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice (in fact, the ECJ is mentioned more than 60 times in this document). The document says that decisions adopted by European Union institutions during this period ""shall be binding on and in the United Kingdom"". The transition period is also designed to allow time for the UK and the EU to reach a trade deal. The draft agreement says both sides will use their ""best endeavours"" to ensure that a long term trade deal is in place by the end of 2020. Significantly, if more time is needed, the option of extending the transition appears in the document (although, it makes it clear that the UK would have to pay for it). The document doesn't say how long the transition could be extended for (in fact they've left the date blank), only that the Joint Committee may take a decision ""extending the transition period up to [31 December 20XX]."" UK officials hope that the date will be clarified by the time of the proposed EU summit on 25 November. If there was no long term trade agreement and no extension of the transition, that's when the so-called ""backstop"" would kick in. It's the issue that has dominated negotiations for the last few weeks and months: how to ensure that no hard border (with checks or physical infrastructure) emerges after Brexit between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Both sides agreed back in December 2017 that there should be a guarantee to avoid a hard border under all circumstances. That guarantee came to be known as the backstop, but agreeing a legal text proved very difficult. So what exactly does this draft agreement say about the border, the backstop and the legal guarantees that underpin it? If a backstop is needed, it will - as expected - take the form of a temporary customs union encompassing not just Northern Ireland but the whole of the UK. The draft agreement describes this as a ""single customs territory"". Northern Ireland, though, will be in a deeper customs relationship with the EU than Great Britain, and even more closely tied to the rules of the EU single market. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. One policy area is excluded from these potential customs arrangements: fishing. That's because the trade-off between access for UK fish produce to EU markets, and access for EU boats to UK waters, is too controversial. The draft agreement simply states that ""the Union and the United Kingdom shall use their best endeavours to conclude and ratify"" an agreement ""on access to waters and fishing opportunities"". There are also details of one of the last issues to be negotiated - the terms on which the UK may be able to leave this temporary customs arrangement in the future. If either party notifies the other that it wants the backstop to come to an end, a joint ministerial committee will meet within six months to consider the details. But the backstop (which is part of the Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland) would only cease to apply if ""the Union and the United Kingdom decide jointly"" that it is no longer necessary. In other words, the UK will not have a unilateral right to bring those arrangements to an end. For some Brexiteers, that is simply unacceptable. A guide to where we are with Brexit But, don't forget, other countries will also have their concerns. They too will focus on the language surrounding a temporary customs union, to ensure that nothing is hidden there which could, in their view, give the UK rights without responsibilities; and - potentially - a competitive advantage. The EU insists the draft agreement ""includes the corresponding level playing field commitments and appropriate enforcement mechanisms to ensure fair competition between the EU27 and the UK."" So, it's not just in London that this document will be closely scrutinised. Finally one big question: to what extent could these temporary customs arrangements form the basis for a permanent future relationship, which can only be negotiated formally after Brexit has actually happened?

The draft agreement simply states that ""the Union and the United Kingdom shall use their best endeavours to conclude and ratify"" an agreement ""on access to waters and fishing opportunities"". There are also details of one of the last issues to be negotiated - the terms on which the UK may be able to leave this temporary customs arrangement in the future. If either party notifies the other that it wants the backstop to come to an end, a joint ministerial committee will meet within six months to consider the details. But the backstop (which is part of the Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland) would only cease to apply if ""the Union and the United Kingdom decide jointly"" that it is no longer necessary. In other words, the UK will not have a unilateral right to bring those arrangements to an end. For some Brexiteers, that is simply unacceptable. A guide to where we are with Brexit But, don't forget, other countries will also have their concerns. They too will focus on the language surrounding a temporary customs union, to ensure that nothing is hidden there which could, in their view, give the UK rights without responsibilities; and - potentially - a competitive advantage. The EU insists the draft agreement ""includes the corresponding level playing field commitments and appropriate enforcement mechanisms to ensure fair competition between the EU27 and the UK."" So, it's not just in London that this document will be closely scrutinised. Finally one big question: to what extent could these temporary customs arrangements form the basis for a permanent future relationship, which can only be negotiated formally after Brexit has actually happened?

PC convicted of raping 13-year-old,"Ian Naude admitted having sex with the teenager, but said it was consensual A policeman described as a ""committed paedophile"" has been convicted of raping a 13-year-old girl. PC Ian Naude, 30, joined Cheshire Constabulary ""to gain the keys to a sweetshop"" through access to potential victims, Liverpool Crown Court heard. The rape, which took place in his car, was filmed on his mobile phone. Footage of the attack was played to the jury. It has emerged Naude was already being investigated for sex offences when he became a student officer in April 2017. How a predatory paedophile become a PC Naude, of Market Drayton in Shropshire, was also found guilty of four charges of attempting to arrange the commission of a child sex offence and one charge of arranging a child sex offence, relating to five complainants aged between 12 and 15. The father of one, originally from South Africa, previously admitted 31 offences relating to grooming underage girls via a fake Facebook and Snapchat profile. Naude raped the girl after being called to her home to attend a domestic incident Cheshire Constabulary said Naude had passed the vetting process in October 2016 but that allegations of sex offences being investigated by two neighbouring forces in early 2017 did not get picked up. Latest news from the West Midlands During his two-week trial, Naude denied rape and sexual assault as he claimed the sex with the 13-year-old girl was consensual and that she ""seemed to be enjoying it"". The court was told he met the girl after he was called to her house over a domestic incident in October 2017. After looking her up on Facebook and exchanging sexual messages and photos, he returned to her home three days later. He picked her up while her mother was out and drove her to a country lane where he attacked her. Naude used names including ""Bruce Wayne"" and ""King of the North"" on fake profiles Naude deleted more than 750 photos from his phone after an ""administrative error"" meant he had been copied into emails relating to the police investigation into his conduct. He also concealed other devices including a second phone and a laptop in a field in Market Drayton. Cheshire Constabulary said this had ""frustrated"" and ""set back"" the investigation. Texts sent by Naude revealed a pattern, always starting conversations with ""Hi, you look pretty and interesting"", before quickly demanding nude images and threatening to expose girls to their friends if they refused. Naude threatened to expose his victims if they did not comply with his demands Cheshire Police's Det Ch Supt Aaron Duggan said Naude ""joined police intentionally to commit this type of offending. ""We know from our investigation that he's a sexual predator, a groomer and he's also a chancer."" Acting Chief Constable Janette McCormick said she believed Naude had been working alone but it would be ""naive"" to think there were not other offenders within Cheshire Police. She has also said the force is now investigating other potential offences by Naude. Rape accused PC said girl 'enjoyed it' 'Paedophile' PC 'demanded nude pictures' 'Paedophile' PC 'raped teenage girl' Judge Clement Goldstone warned Naude he faced a ""very significant sentence"" and that even his defence conceded he had been ""fairly depicted... as a cold, uncaring, selfish and cruel paedophile"". An NSPCC spokesperson said it was ""evil"" of Naude to ""shamelessly label it [the rape] consensual"". Naude will be sentenced on 13 December.

"White House aide removed after Melania rowThe first lady said Mira Ricardel ""no longer deserves the honour"" of serving in the White House.US & Canada","Mira Ricardel (left) and Melania Trump (right) White House Deputy National Security Adviser Mira Ricardel has left her post, following a high-profile row with US First Lady Melania Trump. A White House spokeswoman said Mrs Ricardel ""departs the White House to transition to a new role within the administration"". She did not elaborate. Mrs Trump this week said that Mrs Ricardel ""no longer deserves the honour of serving in this White House"". The two reportedly feuded during a tour of Africa in October. In pictures: Melania Trump's whistle-stop Africa tour The removal of Mrs Ricardel comes amid reports in US media that President Donald Trump is considering a shake-up in the White House West Wing. Mr Trump may be preparing to remove White House Chief of Staff John Kelly or Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, the reports say. The announcement of the transfer of Mrs Ricardel was made in a statement by White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders on Wednesday. The spokeswoman added that Mrs Ricardel ""will continue to support the president"". According to US media reports earlier this week, Mrs Trump and Mrs Ricardel quarrelled over seating arrangements on her plane. During her trip there, Mrs Trump told ABC in a rare interview that there were people in the White House who she does not trust. She said she gave the president ""my honest advice and honest opinions and then he does what he wants to do"". The Wall Street Journal had earlier reported that Mrs Trump's team believed Mrs Ricardel was behind some of the ""negative stories"" about Mrs Trump and her staff. The newspaper also reported that she repeatedly clashed with US Secretary of Defense James Mattis over ""staffing decisions and policy differences"". Mrs Ricardel was hired away from the Department of Commerce by National Security Advisor John Bolton, and has decades of experience working in the US government. She had earlier worked in the defence department under former President George W Bush as well as under Republican Senator Bob Dole when he served as the Senate Majority Leader.

"'Cut lamb and beef' to fight climate changeThe number of sheep and cattle in the UK should be reduced to help combat climate change, a report says.Science & Environment","The number of sheep and cattle in the UK should be reduced by between a fifth and a half to help combat climate change, a report says. The shift is needed, the governmentâs advisory Committee on Climate Change (CCC) maintains, because beef and lamb produce most farm greenhouse gases. The report foresees an increase in the number of pigs and chickens because these produce less methane. The farm union NFU said it did not agree with reducing livestock numbers. But environmentalists say the recommendations are too timid. The CCC says a 20-50% reduction in beef and lamb pasture could release 3-7m hectares of grassland from the current 12m hectares in the UK. The un-needed grassland could instead grow forests and biofuels that would help to soak up CO2. The committeeâs advice on producing less red meat is less radical than NHS Eatwell guidelines on healthy eating, which proposes a reduction in consumption of 89% for beef and 63% for lamb, and a 20% decline in dairy products. BBC News understands that the committee have deliberately taken a more conservative position in order to minimise confrontation with the farmersâ union, the NFU. The chief executive of the Committee on Climate Change (CCC), Chris Stark, told BBC News: âClimate change is going to change the way the UK looks â and we also have to alter the way we use land so we donât make climate change worse. âBrexit offers the government the opportunity to introduce fundamentally new policies that will reward farmers for producing less greenhouse gases and for capturing carbon emissions.â Carbon is stored in plants and in the soil, so the CCC recommends that farm subsidies should raise the proportion of UK land under forestry from 14% to 19%, and restore peat bogs. NFU President Minette Batters said: ""The NFU has been clear with its position on British farming's role in tackling climate change - reducing livestock numbers in the UK is not a part of that policy. ""We are disappointed to see the Committee on Climate Change include that recommendation in its report. The report simply does not recognise the environmental benefits grass-fed beef and sheep production brings to the UK. ""It would be a fundamental mistake to design a farming system solely around an approach that mitigates greenhouse gases without any regard to the wider impact of such a policy for our environment and our food supply. It risks producing a one-eyed policy."" Earlier, the NFU had said that it welcomed the report's call for diversification of land use. The environmental campaigner George Monbiot told BBC News: âThis is a timid and inadequate report. Roughly four million hectares of uplands is used for sheep, yet sheep account for just 1.2% of our diet. âAllowing trees to return to a significant portion on this land has a far greater potential for carbon reduction than the puny measures proposed in this report.â Friends of the Earth's Guy Shrubsole said: ""We need to reforest far more of Britain than the government's current puny tree-planting targets - going beyond what this report calls for and doubling forest cover to lock-up carbon and help prevent floods."" There may be controversy, too, over the committeeâs recommendation for the UK to grow more trees and plants to burn for energy â known as biomass. A separate CCC report says biomass can play an important role in cutting emissions in the UK â but only if itâs produced in a way that doesnât harm the environment. It could only be used after 2030 if carbon capture equipment were fitted. The CCC says climate change is already changing the landscape. it says as UK temperatures have risen by 0.8Â°C over the last 40 years, farmers have made the impacts worse. Loss of soil fertility, plant and animal species are now apparent, it says, mainly driven by intensive food production. Projections suggest more warming, sea level rise, greater risks from flooding and drought. ""Despite some opportunities,â the report says,""The negative impacts on our soils, water, vegetation and wildlife are likely to be significant.â Follow Rogeron Twitter.,external Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser Wildfire sweeps through Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA Paris Hilton among stars 'heartbroken' as she watches home 'burn to ground' Commuters warned of icy roads as cold snap continues to freeze UK Sound Of 2025: Ezra Collective are 'keeping music real' The Papers: 'Apocalypse' LA and 'Reeves faces extra tax rises' How Australia's beach cabana drama sparked a turf war H-1B: Visa row under Trump fuels anxiety for Indian dreamers 'I thought I was going to die': Jailed Venezuelan activist details brutality of prison life The man who could become Canada's future PM 'Trump 2.0' looms large over the global economy A politician was shot dead in Bangkok.

Katya Adler: EU fears politics could still bin Brexit deal,"EU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier spoke warmly about the draft deal Ashen-faced European diplomats haunt the corridors of Brussels. No rest for them until Sunday 25 November - the day of the ""seal the deal"" Brexit summit between Theresa May and EU leaders. So what do they have to do between now and then? Diplomats from the 27 EU countries must now pore over 585 pages of the draft Brexit withdrawal agreement with lawyers to ensure all will be to each government's liking. If a problem is identified, it will need to be transmitted to the team of Michel Barnier, the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, as early as this Friday or Saturday. The 27 member states (and Theresa May) also still have to agree what should be in the political declaration on the future EU-UK relationship. This part of the divorce treaty is not legally binding - but it is symbolically important. At the moment the text is solely made up of a series of bullet points and headings. So the pressure is definitely on, leading up to the 25th. What happened and what's next? Brexit deal: Does this mean everything is decided? A brief guide to where we are with Brexit But all this could be in vain if the Brexit deal is voted down by the UK parliament in a few weeks' time. The EU knows this is a very real possibility. I put the question to Michel Barnier on Wednesday night at his press conference - but, skilled politician that he is, he refused to engage. Brussels is very keen indeed not to give the impression that the EU might change or come up with a ""better"" Brexit deal text if this one ends up being rejected in the House of Commons. Mr Barnier quoted Theresa May as saying that this is a deal in the UK's interest. In fact, he spoke so warmly about the deal - how hard EU and UK negotiators had worked on it, how successful they had been in protecting citizens' rights, the Irish border and the constitutional integrity of the UK - that one colleague commented to me it was as if Mr Barnier, known for his suave French manner, believed they had managed to conjure an exquisitely designed Faberge egg out of the complex Brexit process. No wonder then that he didn't want to engage in the possibility of that egg getting smashed. This video can not be played Theresa May says she believes with her ""head and her heart"" that it is in the best interests of the UK Truth be told, he's unlikely to face much trouble from the EU side. He is off to Strasbourg on Thursday to schmooze the European parliament - which has a veto over the Brexit deal. MEPs will look at the section of the withdrawal agreement on citizens' right with a particularly critical eye as that is the issue they tend most to focus on. But Mr Barnier has been careful to keep the parliament in the loop on negotiations throughout, so they're unlikely to reject a final agreement. Reality Check: When is the crunch time? EU countries had also given Ireland an effective veto over the deal if Dublin were unhappy about the provisions for the Irish border. But the Irish prime minister gave the green light to the draft text on Wednesday, so that is no longer an issue. Spain and Gibraltar, and Cyprus and the UK military bases on the island were also thought to be potential pitfalls. The withdrawal agreement sorted them out too. This leaves the concerns the UK's biggest EU trade partners (like France and Germany) had over the so-called ""level playing field"": ensuring that the UK was tied to extra EU regulations in the temporary customs relationship outlined in the Irish backstop, should it one day be triggered. Well, about 100 pages of the draft withdrawal treaty are dedicated to these extra ties - on state aid, environment and labour regulations - ensuring that UK business should not have a competitive advantage over EU ones in a customs partnership. Rights to fish in UK waters after Brexit have not yet been agreed, and the Spanish, French, Danish or Dutch will probably have something to say about that - but it's not a deal breaker at this stage. So, those Europeans wary of political trouble that could disrupt or destroy the careful Brexit deal choreography between now and 25 November (and beyond) look fearfully at the politically volatile UK. This led one EU civil servant late on Wednesday night to jab at the 585 pages of the draft Brexit treaty, muttering: ""You know what? All this could still end up in the bin.""

NI junior minister quits over deal,"This video can not be played Nigel Dodds accused Theresa May of ignoring promises she made to the DUP about Northern Ireland over the Brexit deal Parliament has a ""clear choice"" to stand up for the UK against a draft Brexit deal or allow it to break up the union and make the UK a ""vassal"" state, DUP MP Nigel Dodds has said.

Several cabinet ministers have resigned, saying the deal presents a threat to the integrity of the union. Mr Dodds was among MPs criticising the prime minister in the House of Commons amid a backlash over her plan. The DUP's 10 MPs prop up the Conservative government to ensure it has a majority to pass key legislation in the Commons. Mr Dodds said he could take Mrs May through the list of promises she made about the future of Northern Ireland but that would be a ""waste of time because she clearly doesn't listen"". He put it to MPs: ""The choice is now clear, we stand up for the United Kingdom, the whole of the United Kingdom, the integrity of the United Kingdom or we vote for a vassal state with the break-up of the UK."" But the prime minister said it was wrong to imply that she had not considered the interests of the people of Northern Ireland. The real spat among politicians is over the UK and EU's agreement on the Northern Ireland backstop. It would see Northern Ireland staying aligned to some rules of the EU single market, if another solution cannot be found by the end of the transition period in December 2020. That means that goods coming into Northern Ireland would need to be checked to see if they meet EU standards. It would also involve a temporary single custom territory effectively keeping the whole of the UK in the EU customs union - until both the EU and UK agree that it is no longer necessary. Mrs May has said there was no deal on the table that did not involve signing up to the backstop - but that it is only an insurance policy. Allow Twitter content?

Jack: Brexit warnings 'focused minds',"Business Secretary Greg Clark and the Chancellor Philip Hammond thanked business leaders for helping to highlight the economic damage a no-deal scenario might do to the economy. That prospect helped focus minds among cabinet ministers in a marathon and fractious meeting at Number 10, according to sources present. ""When evidence and facts met hopes and aspirations the evidence and facts won,"" said one minister. However, one attendee described the backstop arrangement, the fallback position if a trade deal is not secured by December 2020, as unsatisfactory. Not in the sense it gave the EU too much power, as some pro-Brexit politicians have complained, but in that it might result in unwelcome additional checks and oversight of goods travelling between the UK and Europe. As a minister said, people around the table have become much more familiar with advanced manufacturing supply chains. Offsetting that threat was the specific possibility of extending the transition period beyond December 2020. However, ministers said they did not expect firms to alter their planning for a no deal outcome in March given the challenge of getting this deal through parliament.

Stormy Daniels' lawyer arrested,"This video can not be played Michael Avenatti: 'I have never struck a woman' Michael Avenatti, lawyer for porn star Stormy Daniels in her suit against President Donald Trump, has been arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, police in Los Angeles say. Celebrity news website TMZ said this followed a physical confrontation between the lawyer and a woman. He denied the claim and was later released on $50,000 (Â£38,500) bail. The lawyer represents Ms Daniels, who alleges she and President Trump had a brief relationship - a claim he denies. Michael Avenatti rose to prominence as lawyer to porn actor and director Stormy Daniels Ms Daniels has sought to free herself from a non-disclosure agreement she signed before the 2016 election. The president and the porn star: Why this matters The conflicting statements in the Stormy Daniels saga NDAs: What are non-disclosure agreements? Mr Avenatti has called the allegations ""completely bogus"" and said he was confident he would be fully exonerated. Speaking to reporters after leaving a police station, he said: ""I have never struck a woman. I never will strike a woman. I have been an advocate for women's rights my entire career and I'm going to continue to be an advocate. ""I am not going to be intimidated from stopping what I am doing.""

The woman who made the allegations had ""visible injuries"" including bruises, according to an unnamed law enforcement official quoted by the Los Angeles Times. Mr Avenatti's estranged wife, Lisa Storie Avenatti, gave a statement to the broadcaster NBC saying he had never been violent to her. His first wife, Christine Avenatti-Carlin, also issued a statement on Wednesday, saying she had known Mr Avenatti for 26 years and describing him as ""a loving, kind father to our two daughters"". ""He has never been abusive to me or anyone else. He is a very good man,"" she said.

'Cut lamb and beef' to fight climate change,"The number of sheep and cattle in the UK should be reduced by between a fifth and a half to help combat climate change, a report says. The shift is needed, the governmentâs advisory Committee on Climate Change (CCC) maintains, because beef and lamb produce most farm greenhouse gases. The report foresees an increase in the number of pigs and chickens because these produce less methane. The farm union NFU said it did not agree with reducing livestock numbers. But environmentalists say the recommendations are too timid. The CCC says a 20-50% reduction in beef and lamb pasture could release 3-7m hectares of grassland from the current 12m hectares in the UK. The un-needed grassland could instead grow forests and biofuels that would help to soak up CO2. The committeeâs advice on producing less red meat is less radical than NHS Eatwell guidelines on healthy eating, which proposes a reduction in consumption of 89% for beef and 63% for lamb, and a 20% decline in dairy products. BBC News understands that the committee have deliberately taken a more conservative position in order to minimise confrontation with the farmersâ union, the NFU. The chief executive of the Committee on Climate Change (CCC), Chris Stark, told BBC News: âClimate change is going to change the way the UK looks â and we also have to alter the way we use land so we donât make climate change worse. âBrexit offers the government the opportunity to introduce fundamentally new policies that will reward farmers for producing less greenhouse gases and for capturing carbon emissions.â Carbon is stored in plants and in the soil, so the CCC recommends that farm subsidies should raise the proportion of UK land under forestry from 14% to 19%, and restore peat bogs. NFU President Minette Batters said: ""The NFU has been clear with its position on British farming's role in tackling climate change - reducing livestock numbers in the UK is not a part of that policy. ""We are disappointed to see the Committee on Climate Change include that recommendation in its report. The report simply does not recognise the environmental benefits grass-fed beef and sheep production brings to the UK. ""It would be a fundamental mistake to design a farming system solely around an approach that mitigates greenhouse gases without any regard to the wider impact of such a policy for our environment and our food supply. It risks producing a one-eyed policy."" Earlier, the NFU had said that it welcomed the report's call for diversification of land use. The environmental campaigner George Monbiot told BBC News: âThis is a timid and inadequate report. Roughly four million hectares of uplands is used for sheep, yet sheep account for just 1.2% of our diet. âAllowing trees to return to a significant portion on this land has a far greater potential for carbon reduction than the puny measures proposed in this report.â Friends of the Earth's Guy Shrubsole said: ""We need to reforest far more of Britain than the government's current puny tree-planting targets - going beyond what this report calls for and doubling forest cover to lock-up carbon and help prevent floods."" There may be controversy, too, over the committeeâs recommendation for the UK to grow more trees and plants to burn for energy â known as biomass. A separate CCC report says biomass can play an important role in cutting emissions in the UK â but only if itâs produced in a way that doesnât harm the environment. It could only be used after 2030 if carbon capture equipment were fitted. The CCC says climate change is already changing the landscape. it says as UK temperatures have risen by 0.8Â°C over the last 40 years, farmers have made the impacts worse. Loss of soil fertility, plant and animal species are now apparent, it says, mainly driven by intensive food production. Projections suggest more warming, sea level rise, greater risks from flooding and drought. ""Despite some opportunities,â the report says,""The negative impacts on our soils, water, vegetation and wildlife are likely to be significant.â Follow Rogeron Twitter.,external Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser Wildfire sweeps through Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA Paris Hilton among stars 'heartbroken' as she watches home 'burn to ground' Commuters warned of icy roads as cold snap continues to freeze UK Sound Of 2025: Ezra Collective are 'keeping music real' The Papers: 'Apocalypse' LA and 'Reeves faces extra tax rises' How Australia's beach cabana drama sparked a turf war H-1B: Visa row under Trump fuels anxiety for Indian dreamers 'I thought I was going to die': Jailed Venezuelan activist details brutality of prison life The man who could become Canada's future PM 'Trump 2.0' looms large over the global economy A politician was shot dead in Bangkok.

Most pubs 'don't stop children gambling',"Only 10% of pubs intervene to stop children gambling on their premises, the Gambling Commission has found. The watchdog said it had found a ""concerning"" number of pubs where youngsters used gaming machines. Pub staff are expected to prevent under-18s playing on the machines and there should be clear signage indicating the age restriction. The British Beer and Pub Association said it took the findings ""very seriously"". The Gambling Commission said it had been working with local police and licensing authorities to check pubs were acting within the law. Teenagers 'bombarded by gambling ads' Reality Check: Is the watershed still relevant? It said the 89% rate of failure - found across a sample of pubs - was much worse than the 15% to 30% failure rate seen in other industries selling age-restricted products, such as alcohol or tobacco. Helen Rhodes, programme director at the Gambling Commission, said: ""We are extremely concerned that pubs across England are failing to stop children playing gaming machines designed for adults. ""We urgently call on the pub sector to take action immediately to enforce the laws in place to protect children and young people."" Brigid Simmonds, chief executive of the British Beer and Pub Association (BBPA), said that pubs should offer a ""safe and friendly environment for families"". ""We have ensured that all of our members are aware of both the BBPA's and Gambling Commission's codes of practice and we are already taking steps to develop a social charter for responsible gambling, for use by licensees and pub companies. ""However given the importance of this issue we are seeking urgent meetings with the Gambling Commission and local authorities to ensure appropriate action is taken."" On Tuesdaythe government promised to bring forward a cutto the maximum bet on fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs) amid pressure from MPs. It had originally planned to reduce the stake from Â£100 to Â£2 in October next year, but will now do so from April. FOBTs have been criticised for encouraging excessive gambling and exposing people to the risk of addiction, and the social, mental and financial problems associated with gambling.

Killed mum's daughter backs abuse scheme,"Natalie Hemming's family reported her missing almost three weeks before her body was found dumped in woodland A teenager whose mother was killed by her partner is supporting a scheme that sees police tell a child's school about domestic abuse at home. Kirstie and her brother and sister were asleep when mum Natalie Hemming was murdered by Paul Hemming. The 14-year-old said it was vital young people got help and support at school. Figures for the scheme show authorities have contacted schools in England and Wales more than 46,000 times in a year to flag up domestic abuse incidents. Operation Encompass is aimed at ensuring police or the council informs a school before lessons start for the day when one of its pupils has been exposed to abuse at home the night before. Kirstie is training to be a domestic violence ambassador at her school It should mean staff can make sure appropriate support is in place to give the child the help they need. Kirstie was 12 when her mum wasbeaten to death in the family home in Milton Keynes in 2016 by Hemming, who was father to Ms Hemming's two other children. Her younger brother woke up and came downstairs to see his father scrubbing the floor in the living room while his mum's body was wrapped in a rug. Hemming, who then dumped her body in woodland, was jailed for at least 20 years. The teenager, who is now being brought up by her aunt and living in West Yorkshire, said being caught up in domestic violence had had a strain on her learning. ""There was just so much going on around me and it distracted me all the time and it would keep me up at night meaning I was tired the next day at school,"" she said. Kirstie, who is now training to be a domestic violence ambassador at her school, said Operation Encompass was crucial in giving child victims a voice. ""When you go through something like that you need the support and you need someone to talk to and someone to help you."" Domestic abuse and children About one in five children in the UK has been exposed to domestic abuse Domestic abuse is a factor in over half of serious case reviews A third of children witnessing domestic violence also experienced another form of abuse One in five teenagers has been physically abused by their boyfriends or girlfriends Source: NSPCC,external Operation Encompass was first set up in Cornwall in 2011 by primary school head teacher Elisabeth Carney-Haworth and her husband David, who is a former police officer. It started after Mrs Carney-Haworth noticed the behaviour of a six-year-old boy at her school had suddenly changed and it was not until months later she found out he had witnessed a violent domestic incident at home. Angered that she had not been informed and was therefore unable to properly help him, she shared her frustrations with her husband and out of that the scheme was born. Since its introduction, it has been adopted in some form by 33 out of 44 police forces across England and Wales and the pair are pushing for it to be made compulsory. Elisabeth Carney-Haworth wants to see Operation Encompass become compulsory for all police forces Figures obtained by the BBC through Freedom of Information requests revealed that between September 2017 and July 2018, authorities alerted schools tens of thousands of times. Every police force was asked how many times it had contacted schools and 35 replied. Of those, 24 said they used the scheme but only 17 forces could provide figures on how often it had been implemented. Those 17 forces said they had contacted schools on a total of 46,591 occasions. Can violent men ever change? 'Not enough support' for male abuse victims Smart home gadgets domestic abuse warning In North Yorkshire, the scheme has been taken up by almost every school, including All Saints School in York. Since it started there, the safeguarding team has been contacted by police on average twice a month about children witnessing domestic abuse. Jo Sandwell, assistant head, said: ""Prior to this there would be students living in violent home situations and we as a school would not have any idea. ""We would see the consequences of that, perhaps in behaviour or a child being a bit more withdrawn. ""Once you understand you can then provide real support."" If you, or someone who know, have been affected by domestic abuse, you can contact theBBC's Action Line.

LivePound drops as Raab quits,"Get in touch: bizlivepage@bbc.co.uk Shares in banks and housebuilders slide Sterling under $1.28 Retail sales fall in October Asda sales rise for sixth quarter Beyonce cuts ties with Sir Philip Green Tom Espiner Whew. Another rollercoaster day on the Business Live page. Join us again for more Brexit-related fun tomorrow from 06:00. Sir Elton mid-career in this year's John Lewis Christmas ad You'll have seen it by now if you're interested in that kind of thing: this year's John Lewis ad features everyone's favourite crooner Elton John and a cute toddler. But what is the magic formula behind a really great Christmas ad? The BBC'sBecky Morton's been finding out, and it seems that retailers are pretty divided between those that want to show us their wares and those that just want to tug on our heart strings. Brent Crude has slipped from above $80 a barrel a month ago The price of oil has risen for the second day in a row, recovering some of the ground lost earlier in the week. Brent Crude rose 50 cents to $66.62 a barrel and US West Texas Intermediate crude
futures rose 21 cents to settle at $56.46 a barrel. Earlier in the week concerns over flagging global demand and excess supply had hit spot prices. But as you can see from the graph above it'll take more than a couple of days uptick to bring oil prices back to where they were a month ago. US stock indexes have closed higher after a report that
US trade representative Robert Lighthizer has informed industry
executives that the next round of tariffs on Chinese imports has
been put on hold. Even though that report was later scotched by Mr Lighthizer's spokesman, the Dow Jones Industrial Average still closed up 208 points or 0.83% at 25,289. The S&P 500 gained 28 points, or 1.06% to close at 2,730. And the Nasdaq Composite added
122 points, or 1.72% to end at 7,259. Ian Geddes, head of retail at Deloitte, says its research finds more than half of consumers do their Christmas shopping in November or earlier. ""Given consumers' appetite to rein in their spending, the promotions on and around Black Friday will likely be more of a draw than ever,"" he says. ""We expect this year's Black Friday to generate record levels of UK spending, which will likely boost November's retail figures overall. Whether it will be enough to make this a 'golden' quarter remains to be seen."" Are you leaving your Santa shopping to the last minute? Let us know:bizlivepage@bbc.co.uk One of the things giving US stocks a boost on Thursday were unconfirmed reports that Trump's chief trade negotiator Robert Lighthizer told business leaders the US was putting the next round of tariffs on Chinese imports on hold. Now the US Trade Representative's spokesperson has flat out denied that. ""Ambassador Lighthizer has made no representations to
industry executives that future Section 301 tariffs are on
hold,""  a statement said. ""The plan for the tariffs....  has not changed at all. Any reports
to the contrary are incorrect,"" the spokesperson said. So that's clear. Apart from Brexit, currently the top trending topic on Twitter is the 2018 John Lewis & Partners Christmas ad, which was launched last night. This year's ad is entitled ""The Boy and The Piano"" and it stars Elton John playing his hit song Your Song, as the ad traces his life and career, from the moment he received the gift of his grandmother's piano as a child. Apparently, the ad is meant to highlight the fact that the department store chain has decided to start selling pianos, for the first time in 70 years. Allow YouTube content?

US trade representative Robert Lighthizer has told industry
executives that the next round of tariffs on Chinese imports has
been put on hold. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was
up 150 points at 25,230, the S&P 500

Nasdaq Composite was up 102 points at 7,246. HSBC and China
Investment Corp are in talks to create a fund for the Chinese
sovereign wealth fund to invest in companies in Britain that
have business links with China, HSBC has said. The fund would be managed by London-based Charterhouse
Capital Partners, which is in talks with CIC and HSBC, the bank said. The three ""are in exclusive discussions to create a fund
to invest in high-quality and growing UK companies with
development opportunities in China,"" HSBC added. The Financial Times said the fund could be worth Â£1bn. The FT hascome up with a handy cut-out-and-keep flowchart,externalwhich succinctly sums up various possible outcomes of the Brexit process from here. So for example, if there is not a vote of no-confidence in Theresa May, and the Brexit agreement goes to a vote in Parliament, the proposed deal could be accepted or defeated. If it is defeated, Labour could propose a motion of no-confidence in the government. If that in turn is defeated, we could see no deal, more negotiations, or a second referendum. BBC and correspondents unpick the detail in the government's withdrawal agreement documents. Tesla Model 3s ordered in the US by the end of this month will be delivered by the end of the year, chief executive Elon Muskhas said,external, as the electric carmaker tries to take advantage of tax
breaks. The electric carmaker has until the end of the year to hand
out tax credits of $7,500 to customers. The prospect of talks toamend the draft dealis unlikely as an agreement is ""on the table"". Carmaker BMW is continuing to prepare for a no-deal Brexit, given
uncertainty around Prime Minister Theresa May's deal after
several of her ministers resigned in protest. BMW welcomed this week's draft withdrawal agreement as a
""positive step in the right direction"" but said the political
situation was uncertain. ""Uncertainty is not good for business. As a responsible
employer, we must therefore continue to prepare for the
worst-case scenario, which is what a no-deal Brexit would
represent,"" it said. ""We continue to call on all sides to work towards a final
agreement which maintains the truly frictionless trade on which
our international production network is based."" US stocks struggle as a rebound by tech companies from this week's
sharp losses is outweighed by Brexit-related concerns and a batch of weak results. Department store chain Dillard's fell 13.7% after reporting
third-quarter results, and shares in Walmart gave up gains to trade
down 1.5%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was
down 110 points at 24,970, the S&P 500

The pound has barely registered a flicker as Prime Minister Theresa May says she will see Brexit through. It is still down more than 1.8% against the dollar at $1.2771. Theresa May is giving a press conference after a day of UK political turmoil. She reiterates that her plan ""is a Brexit that delivers on the priorities of the British people"". She says her agreement protects trade, and leaves no hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. ""This deal delivers what people voted for,"" she says, adding ""the British people just want us to get on with it."" She adds: ""Am I going to see this through? Yes.""

Mild autumn hits retail sales in OctoberAnalysts say the worse than expected 0.5% fall in sales suggests shoppers are cutting back spending.BusinessComments,"Retail sales fell by a worse-than-expected 0.5% in October, after a mild autumn hit sales of winter clothes. Sales at household goods stores also fell 3% following a particularly strong August and September,the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.,external For the three months to October, retail sales rose 0.4% - a considerable slowdown from the 2.3% increase recorded for the three months to July. Analysts said October's fall suggested shoppers were cutting back spending. Samuel Tombs at Pantheon Macroeconomics said the drop was the ""first real sign that consumers are tightening their purse strings due to uncertainty about Brexit"". Non-food sales fell 1.3%, with a 1% decline in clothing sales, which he said could not be blamed on the weather. UK inflation holds steady at 2.4% Wages show fastest rise in almost a decade ""Consumers' confidence already has weakened in recent months due to concerns about the economic outlook and we doubt households are feeling any surer that a no-deal Brexit will be avoided after this week's political turbulence,"" Mr Tombs said. ""Unless the government miraculously manages to force the current withdrawal agreement through parliament soon, growth in consumers' spending will weaken markedly in the fourth quarter."" Thomas Pugh at Capital Economics said some of October's weakness may reflect consumers delaying spending ahead of ""Black Friday"" discounting this month. ""High oil prices also weighed on the volume of fuel sold. As such, we suspect that there could be a rebound in sales volumes in November as oil prices have fallen sharply and if Black Friday sales pick up,"" he added. The Christmas quarter accounts for a big proportion of profits for most retailers and is set to be very tough. Ian Geddes, head of retail at Deloitte, said more than half of consumers do their Christmas shopping in November or earlier. ""Given consumers' appetite to rein in their spending, the promotions on and around Black Friday will likely be more of a draw than ever,"" he said. ""We expect this year's Black Friday to generate record levels of UK spending, which will likely boost November's retail figures overall. Whether it will be enough to make this a 'golden' quarter remains to be seen."" It is difficult to say with any certainty, as sterling had already started sliding on Thursday morning following the resignation of Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab over Theresa May's draft Brexit deal before the retail sales figures were released. The pound fell as low as $1.2751 following the departure of Esther McVey, the Work and Pensions Secretary, before recovering some ground to trade at about $1.28 and â¬1.1318 - both falls of 1.5%. Jeremy Thomson-Cook, chief economist at WorldFirst, said: ""All eyes are now on Theresa May with a challenge to her leadership increasingly being viewed as the next catalyst for another sterling collapse."" Earlier this week the ONS said inflation was steady at 2.4% last month, despite expectations of a modest rise. Prices of food and clothing fell, but utility bills and petrol prices were up, said the ONS. Separate ONS figures suggested that the squeeze on consumers' wallets is easing slightly, as wage growth outstrips inflation. In the three months to September, wages excluding bonuses rose by 3.2% compared with a year earlier - the biggest rise since the end of 2008.

Hi-tech watches let children be spied on,"This video can not be played WATCH: How MiSafes watch can be hacked A location-tracking smartwatch worn by thousands of children has proven relatively easy to hack. A security researcher found the devices neither encrypted the data they used nor secured each child's account. As a result, he said, he could track children's movements, surreptitiously listen in to their activities and make spoof calls to the watches that appeared to be from parents. Experts say the issues are so severe that the product should be discarded. Both the BBC and the researcher involved tried to contact the makers of the MiSafes Kid's Watcher Plus to alert them to the problem but received no reply. Likewise, a China-based company listed as the product's supplier did not respond to requests. The MiSafes watch was first released in 2015. It uses a global positioning system (GPS) sensor and a 2G mobile data connection to let parents see where their child is, via a smartphone app. MiSafes targeted the watch at children as young as three In addition, parents can create a ""safe zone"" and receive an alert if the child leaves the area. The adult can also listen in to what their offspring is doing at any time and trigger two-way calls. Pen Test Partner's Ken Munro and Alan Monie learned of the product's existence when a friend bought one for his son earlier this year. Out of curiosity, they probed its security measures and found that easy-to-find PC software could be used to mimic the app's communications. This software could be used to change the assigned ID number, which was all it took to get access to others' accounts. This made it possible to see personal information used to register the product, including: a photo of the child their name, gender and date of birth their height and weight the parents' phone numbers the phone number assigned to the watch's Sim card ""It's probably the simplest hack we have ever seen,"" he told the BBC. ""I wish it was more complicated. It isn't."" Rather than compromise other people's watches,  the researchers bought several more units to test. The security researchers were able to fool the watch into showing a call was from a parent With these, they found it was possible to: trigger the remote listening facility of someone else's watch, with the only warning being that a brief ""busy"" message appeared before its screen returned to blank track the wearer's current and past locations alter the safe zone facility so that alerts were triggered by a child's approach rather than their departure Pen Test Partners also learned it was possible to bypass a feature supposed to limit the watch to accepting calls from only authorised parties. The researchers did this by using a online ""prank call"" service that fools receiving devices into showing another person's caller ID number. The watches allow parents to listen to their children ""any time"" as well as to make phone calls to the device ""Once a hacker has the parent's number, they could spoof a call to appear to come from it and the child would now think it's their mum or dad dialling,"" said Mr Munro. ""So they could leave a voice message or speak to the child to convince them to leave their house and go to a convenient location."" Using a different tool, Mr Munro said his team were able to see that about 14,000 MiSafes were still in active use. The Norwegian Consumer Council highlightedother cases of child-targeted smartwatches with security flaws last year. It said the MiSafes products appeared to be ""even more problematic"" than the examples it had flagged. ""This is another example of unsecure products that should never have reached the market,"" said Gro Mette Moen, the watchdog's acting director of digital services. ""Our advice is to refrain from buying these smartwatches until the sellers can prove that their features and security standards are satisfactory."" In the UK, Amazon used to sell the watches but has not had stock for some time. The BBC found three listings for the watches on eBay earlier this week but the online marketplace said it had since removed them on the grounds of an existing ban on equipment that could be used to spy on people's activities without their knowledge. ""We don't allow the sale of these products on our marketplace,"" said a spokeswoman. MiSafes previously made headlines in February when an Austrian cyber-security company discoveredseveral flaws with its Mi-Cam baby monitors,external. Security concerns were previously raised about the firm's baby-monitoring cameras SEC Consult said these meant hackers could spy on footage from owners' homes and hijack accounts. It too was unable to get a response from the manufacturer. How MiSafes watches can be hacked.

Laura Kuenssberg: The domino to cause the fall?,"This video can not be played Dominic Raab, who quit as Brexit secretary, says a change of course is needed 12:00 GMT: I've just been speaking to Dominic Raab, the now former Brexit Secretary. His verdict on the prime minister's deal is damning. He told me that because of the way the agreement treats Northern Ireland and the rest of the country differently - and the way the country couldn't decide on its own to leave the so-called backstop - that the draft deal is a betrayal of people's trust. Mr Raab, who says he told the chief whip straight after cabinet yesterday that he would quit, says the prime minister can still change course, and should be ready to walk away with no deal. He insists the short-term disruption that might entail - which many of his colleagues think would be catastrophic - would be worth it. Better in his view to tolerate short-term pain, than lock ourselves into a dreadful arrangement for years and years to come. That prospect horrifies others in the government, and on the backbenches too. But it's a risk worth taking he says - claiming it's the best way to proceed, to be willing to risk no deal in the face of what he describes as the EU's ""blackmail"". The alternative for the prime minister, carrying on like this, he says, is inevitable defeat in the Commons and who knows what would happen then. Might he put himself forward if it all falls apart? His answer was it is ""irresponsible"" to be talking about that right now. But notably, not ruling himself out and knowing, perhaps in a few days' or weeks' time, he might have to give a very different answer. Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab resigns Reality Check: What does the draft withdrawal agreement reveal? 10:00 GMT: A resignation in itself is not a surprise - but the departure of the Brexit secretary might be the domino that causes everything else to fall. It's not just that it was his job to make the policy work. It's because he has just given unhappy Brexiteers someone to rally round, and someone who sees himself as a potential challenger to the PM. After his departure, it becomes extremely difficult for other Brexiteers unhappy about the deal to stay on. And in the last few minutes Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey has decided to leave the government. There is speculation about International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt too, although sources close to her say a departure today is far from definite. Meanwhile, No 10 is busy trying to explain its policy this morning to opposition politicians and then to Parliament in the next hour. But there have been three resignations from government - Northern Ireland minister Shailesh Vara was the first to quit - and it's not even 10:00 GMT. It's too early to say if this morning's storm will be a hurricane that will sweep the policy, and maybe the prime minister away.

Laura Kuenssberg: What happened and what's next?,"Regular readers know that I am sometimes, especially at an uncertain moment, fond of making a list. On Wednesday night, the prime minister has taken a big step forward on the path to taking the UK out of the EU without a giant political accident. It's not been a pretty process so far, and five hours of cabinet discussion was not easy either. But again, she made it this far. Surviving tonight, though, does not mean surviving Thursday. So what happened and what's next? The most important fact on Wednesday night - Theresa May has a draft divorce deal with the EU that sorts out how and when we leave, and gives the outline of what the relationship will be like for decades to come. Given how difficult it's been to get this far and how uncertain it's been that she would make it to this point, that is a big achievement. The cabinet backed her, but not exactly with glad hearts. Depending who you ask, either about 10 of its members objected properly to the deal, or about 10 of them expressed a few doubts but didn't have any alternatives to give. The truth is probably somewhere in between. A source in the room told me the sense was that most of them knew this was the only real choice, but none of them wanted it to be done in their name. Having talked to a few people who were present the sense was a reluctant inevitability. And backing from Michael Gove and Geoffrey Cox was key to making that that happen. The cabinet is still pretty divided on the substance of the deal. Although they are now bound by collective responsibility, that means in these trying days ahead, Theresa May can't rely on having colleagues on tap ready to fight for her deal on air, in the Commons tearooms and even in the division lobbies on the crucial night when the vote takes place. The threat of resignations is still live. Esther McVey, the work and pensions secretary, seems the most likely to go, followed by the International Development Secretary, Penny Mordaunt. And there is silence tonight and a lot of chatter about the position of the Brexit Secretary, Dominic Raab (update:Raab resigned on Thursday morning). One might not be a problem for the PM. The departure of either Mordaunt or Raab or both, both of whom harbour ambitions for the top job, would be very dangerous for Number 10. Just as immediately - Brexiteer backbenchers are furious, just like the DUP. And it is possible that the Parliamentary postman will be extremely busy tomorrow with letters that might trigger a challenge to Mrs May. One senior Tory told me on Wednesday night there was likely to be a move against the prime minister in the next 24 hours. Another said they would be amazed if enough objections to start a contest hadn't emerged by lunchtime on Thursday. NB - we have been here before. But soundings so far suggest the reaction among Eurosceptic MPs is more negative than they had expected. This could - I stress, could - be the moment the Tory party falls into a leadership contest almost by mistake. Lastly - if Theresa May gets through the next couple of days and then a summit with the EU on 25 November, she gave us a preview of her script: Her deal, no deal, or no Brexit. For those campaigning for another referendum, the first mention of the fact the whole thing could fall is an admission they are bound to make hay with. But for her colleagues it's a warning, the script that she hopes will see her through.

Reaction as Brexit secretary resigns,"This video can not be played Dominic Raab, who quit as Brexit secretary, says a change of course is needed Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab says he quit the cabinet over ""fatal flaws"" in the draft Brexit agreement with the EU. And he told the BBC the UK should be ready to risk a no-deal Brexit in the face of EU ""blackmail"". Another cabinet minister, Esther McVey, also quit alongside junior ministers Suella Braverman and Shailesh Vara. PM Theresa May faced nearly three hours of largely hostile questions in the Commons and could potentially face a vote of no confidence from Tory MPs. BBC political editorLaura Kuenssberg said,externala source had told her Michael Gove has been offered the job of Brexit Secretary and he was understood to be considering it, but to be asking for assurances that he could pursue a different kind of deal. Leading backbench Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg has submitted a letter of no confidence in her to Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the Tories' backbench 1922 Committee. A vote will be triggered if 48 Tory MPs write letters to Sir Graham. It is understood 48 letters have not yet been received. Mr Rees-Mogg told reporters that the negotiations had ""given way on all the key points"" adding: ""The deal risks Brexit because it is not a proper Brexit."" He denied being involved in a coup against the PM, saying he was ""working through the procedures of the Conservative Party"" which was ""entirely constitutional"". Live: Reaction to Raab resignation Guide: Rules for any challenge to Theresa May Reality Check: What does the draft withdrawal agreement reveal? 'PM has broken Brexit promises' - DUP Mr Rees-Mogg said he did not have any leadership ambitions of his ownbut listed BrexiteersBoris Johnson, David Davis, Dominic Raab, Esther McVey and Penny Mordaunt as among those who would be ""very capable of leading a proper Brexit"". Downing Street said Mrs May would fight any no-confidence vote. Asked by Labour MP Mike Gapes if it was time she ""stood aside for someone else who could take this country forward in a united way"", Mrs May replied: ""No."" This video can not be played How the Conservative Party handles a leadership challenge Chief whip Julian Smith said the prime minister ""will not be bullied"" into changing course. And Foreign Office minister Sir Alan Duncan described Mr Rees-Mogg's comments as ""deeply destructive"" and warned Conservative MPs: ""If this government is undermined further, we could destroy the government, we could significantly damage and even destroy the Conservative Party, all of which would be happening in the middle of an unconcluded set of Brexit negotiations."" He added: ""We have a massive responsibility to exercise our judgement in a climate of what has to be compromise."" This video can not be played Theresa May tells MPs: ""I don't pretend this has been a comfortable process."" The day after Theresa May announced that she had secured the backing of her cabinet for the withdrawal agreement, she told MPs it was not a final agreement, but brought the UK ""close to a Brexit deal"". But she was met with laughter and shouts of ""resign"" as she said it would allow the UK to leave the EU ""in a smooth and orderly way"" on 29 March The prime minister told MPs the agreement would deliver the Brexit people voted for and allow the UK to take back control of its ""money, laws and borders"". But Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn said: ""This is not the deal the country was promised and Parliament cannot - and I believe will not - accept a false choice between this bad deal and no deal."" Dominic Raab - a Leave supporter promoted to the cabinet to replace David Davis who quit in protest at Mrs May's Brexit plans in July - is the most high-profile minister to quit the government. He was closely involved in drafting the 585-page document, which sets out the terms of Britain's departure from the EU. He told the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg: ""I've been fighting for a good Brexit deal but the terms proposed to the cabinet yesterday [Wednesday], I think, had two major and fatal flaws. ""The first is that the terms being offered by the EU threaten the integrity of the United Kingdom and the second is that they would lead to an indefinite if not permanent situation where we're locked into a regime with no say over the rules being applied, with no exit mechanism. ""I think that would be damaging for the economy but devastating for public trust in our democracy."" He said Theresa May needed a Brexit secretary who ""will pursue the deal that she wants to put to the country with conviction"". ""I don't feel I can do that in good conscience,"" he added. He said he held Mrs May in ""high esteem"" but said: ""I do think we need to change course on Brexit"". And he said the government should be willing to risk a no-deal Brexit in the face of what he described as the EU's ""blackmail"". The alternative for the prime minister was her inevitable defeat in the Commons, he argued. Asked if he would put himself forward for leader, if the government falls apart, he did not rule it out but said it would be ""irresponsible"" to be talking about that now. Kuenssberg: Raab gives a damning verdict on PM's deal In her resignation letter, Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey told Mrs May the agreement does not ""honour the result of the referendum, indeed it does not meet the tests you set from the outset of your premiership"". ""We have gone from 'no deal is better than a bad deal' to any deal is better than no deal,"" she added. Anne-Marie Trevelyan, a ministerial aide at the education department, has also quit, as has Ranil Jayawardena,a ministerial aide at the justice department. Northern Ireland minister Shailesh Vara was the first to resign over Mrs May's agreement on Thursday morning, saying, it ""leaves the UK in a halfway house with no time limit on when we will finally be a sovereign nation"". Brexit minister Suella Braverman also quit. And Rehman Chisti quit as vice chairman of the Conservative Party - partly over the withdrawal agreement. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: ""No deal is not a real option, and the government has not seriously prepared for it."" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: ""After two years of bungled negotiations, the government has produced a botched deal that breaches the prime minister's own red lines and does not meet our six tests. ""The government is in chaos. Their deal risks leaving the country in an indefinite halfway house without a real say."" The SNP's leader at Westminster Ian Blackford said Mrs May was ""trying to sell us a deal that is already dead in the water"" and expressed outrage that Scotland was not mentioned once in the draft withdrawal agreement. commitments over citizens' rights after Brexit - people will be able to work and study where they currently live and to be joined by family members a proposed 21-month transition period after the UK's departure a ""fair financial settlement"" from the UK - also known as the Â£39bn ""divorce bill"" But the controversial part relates to what will happen to the Irish border. The agreement includes a ""backstop"" - a kind of safety net to ensure there is no hard border whatever the outcome of future trade talks between the UK and the EU. This video can not be played When will Brexit happen? If there is no trade deal in place by the end of the transition period, the backstop will mean that Northern Ireland would stay aligned to some EU rules on things such as food products and goods standards. It would also involve a temporary single customs territory, effectively keeping the whole of the UK in the EU customs union. Brexiteers do not like the prospect of potentially being tied to EU customs rules for years or even, as some fear, indefinitely. And Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party has said it will not tolerate anything that creates a new border down the Irish Sea and they will not vote for the agreement. Setting out details of the arrangements for a possible ""backstop"", Mrs May said: ""I do not pretend that this has been a comfortable process, or that either we or the EU are entirely happy with some of the arrangements which have been included in it."" But she added that ""while some people might pretend otherwise, there is no deal which delivers the Brexit the British people voted for which does not involve this insurance policy"". She insisted it was a last resort and would be time-limited. Please upgrade your browser Much will depend on whether Mrs May faces a vote of no-confidence in her leadership. If she does, all bets are off. If not, European Council President Donald Tusk has announced an emergency meeting of EU leaders in Brussels on 25 November, at which the withdrawal agreement and a political declaration on future relations would be finalised and formalised. The BBC's Brussels correspondent Adam Fleming said the UK and the EU will have to agree an ultimate end date for the post-Brexit transition period by the end of next week. The transition period is due to end in 2020 and can be extended once by mutual agreement. The text of the draft withdrawal agreement currently says the end date is ""20XX"". A senior EU official said the negotiators will have to fill in a specific year by the 25 November summit. Ultimately any deal would be put to MPs. Tory backbencher Mark Francois told Mrs May earlier that with Labour, the SNP, the Lib Dems and scores of Tory MPs planning to vote against it, it is ""mathematically impossible to get this deal through the House of Commons"".

"White House aide removed after Melania rowThe first lady said Mira Ricardel ""no longer deserves the honour"" of serving in the White House.","Mira Ricardel (left) and Melania Trump (right) White House Deputy National Security Adviser Mira Ricardel has left her post, following a high-profile row with US First Lady Melania Trump. A White House spokeswoman said Mrs Ricardel ""departs the White House to transition to a new role within the administration"". She did not elaborate. Mrs Trump this week said that Mrs Ricardel ""no longer deserves the honour of serving in this White House"". The two reportedly feuded during a tour of Africa in October. In pictures: Melania Trump's whistle-stop Africa tour The removal of Mrs Ricardel comes amid reports in US media that President Donald Trump is considering a shake-up in the White House West Wing. Mr Trump may be preparing to remove White House Chief of Staff John Kelly or Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, the reports say. The announcement of the transfer of Mrs Ricardel was made in a statement by White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders on Wednesday. The spokeswoman added that Mrs Ricardel ""will continue to support the president"". According to US media reports earlier this week, Mrs Trump and Mrs Ricardel quarrelled over seating arrangements on her plane. During her trip there, Mrs Trump told ABC in a rare interview that there were people in the White House who she does not trust. She said she gave the president ""my honest advice and honest opinions and then he does what he wants to do"". The Wall Street Journal had earlier reported that Mrs Trump's team believed Mrs Ricardel was behind some of the ""negative stories"" about Mrs Trump and her staff. The newspaper also reported that she repeatedly clashed with US Secretary of Defense James Mattis over ""staffing decisions and policy differences"". Mrs Ricardel was hired away from the Department of Commerce by National Security Advisor John Bolton, and has decades of experience working in the US government. She had earlier worked in the defence department under former President George W Bush as well as under Republican Senator Bob Dole when he served as the Senate Majority Leader.

Junior NI minister resigns,"This video can not be played Nigel Dodds accused Theresa May of ignoring promises she made to the DUP about Northern Ireland over the Brexit deal Parliament has a ""clear choice"" to stand up for the UK against a draft Brexit deal or allow it to break up the union and make the UK a ""vassal"" state, DUP MP Nigel Dodds has said. The Irish border has been the main sticking point in the talks. The UK and EU have agreed to a ""backstop"", which would see NI stay aligned to some EU rules if another solution cannot be found.

Several cabinet ministers have resigned, saying the deal presents a threat to the integrity of the union. Mr Dodds was among MPs criticising the prime minister in the House of Commons amid a backlash over her plan. The DUP's 10 MPs prop up the Conservative government to ensure it has a majority to pass key legislation in the Commons. Mr Dodds said he could take Mrs May through the list of promises she made about the future of Northern Ireland but that would be a ""waste of time because she clearly doesn't listen"". He put it to MPs: ""The choice is now clear, we stand up for the United Kingdom, the whole of the United Kingdom, the integrity of the United Kingdom or we vote for a vassal state with the break-up of the UK."" But the prime minister said it was wrong to imply that she had not considered the interests of the people of Northern Ireland. The real spat among politicians is over the UK and EU's agreement on the Northern Ireland backstop. It would see Northern Ireland staying aligned to some rules of the EU single market, if another solution cannot be found by the end of the transition period in December 2020. That means that goods coming into Northern Ireland would need to be checked to see if they meet EU standards. It would also involve a temporary single custom territory effectively keeping the whole of the UK in the EU customs union - until both the EU and UK agree that it is no longer necessary. Mrs May has said there was no deal on the table that did not involve signing up to the backstop - but that it is only an insurance policy. Allow Twitter content?

Karen Bradley has denied accusations that the political fall-out over the draft Brexit plan is a ""car crash"" and said the deal was ""good for the union"". She was speaking in Belfast after meeting a number of business leaders to discuss what has been agreed by EU and UK negotiators. ""Nobody said it would be easy,"" said Mrs Bradley, adding that the majority of the cabinet is still behind the deal. She gave Mrs May her full support, and said: ""This is a woman who gets things done."" The Northern Ireland Secretary also appealed for ""cool heads"". ""The people of Northern Ireland when they see this deal will see it is a good deal for the whole of the UK and Northern Ireland, and I hope they tell their politicians that,"" she added. Asked about whether there are question marks over the future of the government's confidence and supply deal with the DUP, Mrs Bradley said that was a ""matter for the parties' chief whips"". Mrs May has faced a huge backlash from the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), amid suggestions of moves within the Conservative Party to force a no-confidence vote. DUP MP Jim Shannon said his party had been ""betrayed"" by the prime minister. This video can not be played What will become of the Irish border when the UK leaves the European Union? He told BBC NI's Good Morning Ulster programme that his party feels Theresa May has broken her commitments to them and is ""up for an election"". Sinn FÃ©in vice-president Michelle O'Neill said Brexit was not an ""orange or green issue"" and that the backstop would protect the Good Friday Agreement, while the SDLP leader Colum Eastwood urged people to stay calm to give the deal space. Stephen Farry, the deputy leader of Alliance said it is important that the business community speaks out more loudly in the coming days, as the deal offers them the best of both worlds.

But Ulster Unionist leader, Robin Swann, said the draft deal had been ""a monumental error of judgement on behalf of the DUP"", which would have a devastating long-term impact.

The Irish Foreign Minister, Simon Coveney, has said people ""should not talk down"" the chances of a Brexit deal getting through Parliament. Mr Coveney told Irish national broadcaster RTÃ that the deal is ""the only one on the table"". An emergency EU summit is now due to take place on 25 November to agree the draft text. After that, Mrs May needs to get MPs to vote for it. The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said that could take place in early December. There have been a number of calls by senior Conservatives for the prime minister to goand there could yet be more resignations from the cabinet. Former chairman of the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee Laurence Robertson said he has written a letter of no confidence in the prime minister to the Conservative Party 's 1922 committee. If 48 letters are submitted then Theresa May would face a no-confidence vote within the Conservative Party.

Jack: Warnings 'focused minds',"Business Secretary Greg Clark and the Chancellor Philip Hammond thanked business leaders for helping to highlight the economic damage a no-deal scenario might do to the economy. That prospect helped focus minds among cabinet ministers in a marathon and fractious meeting at Number 10, according to sources present. ""When evidence and facts met hopes and aspirations the evidence and facts won,"" said one minister. However, one attendee described the backstop arrangement, the fallback position if a trade deal is not secured by December 2020, as unsatisfactory. Not in the sense it gave the EU too much power, as some pro-Brexit politicians have complained, but in that it might result in unwelcome additional checks and oversight of goods travelling between the UK and Europe. As a minister said, people around the table have become much more familiar with advanced manufacturing supply chains. Offsetting that threat was the specific possibility of extending the transition period beyond December 2020. However, ministers said they did not expect firms to alter their planning for a no deal outcome in March given the challenge of getting this deal through parliament.

Another rollercoaster day on the Business Live page. Join us again for more Brexit-related fun tomorrow from 06:00. Sir Elton mid-career in this year's John Lewis Christmas ad You'll have seen it by now if you're interested in that kind of thing: this year's John Lewis ad features everyone's favourite crooner Elton John and a cute toddler. But what is the magic formula behind a really great Christmas ad? The BBC'sBecky Morton's been finding out, and it seems that retailers are pretty divided between those that want to show us their wares and those that just want to tug on our heart strings. Brent Crude has slipped from above $80 a barrel a month ago The price of oil has risen for the second day in a row, recovering some of the ground lost earlier in the week. Brent Crude rose 50 cents to $66.62 a barrel and US West Texas Intermediate crude
futures rose 21 cents to settle at $56.46 a barrel. Earlier in the week concerns over flagging global demand and excess supply had hit spot prices. But as you can see from the graph above it'll take more than a couple of days uptick to bring oil prices back to where they were a month ago. US stock indexes have closed higher after a report that
US trade representative Robert Lighthizer has informed industry
executives that the next round of tariffs on Chinese imports has
been put on hold. Even though that report was later scotched by Mr Lighthizer's spokesman, the Dow Jones Industrial Average still closed up 208 points or 0.83% at 25,289. The S&P 500 gained 28 points, or 1.06% to close at 2,730. And the Nasdaq Composite added
122 points, or 1.72% to end at 7,259. Ian Geddes, head of retail at Deloitte, says its research finds more than half of consumers do their Christmas shopping in November or earlier. ""Given consumers' appetite to rein in their spending, the promotions on and around Black Friday will likely be more of a draw than ever,"" he says. ""We expect this year's Black Friday to generate record levels of UK spending, which will likely boost November's retail figures overall. Whether it will be enough to make this a 'golden' quarter remains to be seen."" Are you leaving your Santa shopping to the last minute? Let us know:bizlivepage@bbc.co.uk One of the things giving US stocks a boost on Thursday were unconfirmed reports that Trump's chief trade negotiator Robert Lighthizer told business leaders the US was putting the next round of tariffs on Chinese imports on hold. Now the US Trade Representative's spokesperson has flat out denied that. ""Ambassador Lighthizer has made no representations to
industry executives that future Section 301 tariffs are on
hold,""  a statement said. ""The plan for the tariffs....  has not changed at all. Any reports
to the contrary are incorrect,"" the spokesperson said. So that's clear. Apart from Brexit, currently the top trending topic on Twitter is the 2018 John Lewis & Partners Christmas ad, which was launched last night. This year's ad is entitled ""The Boy and The Piano"" and it stars Elton John playing his hit song Your Song, as the ad traces his life and career, from the moment he received the gift of his grandmother's piano as a child. Apparently, the ad is meant to highlight the fact that the department store chain has decided to start selling pianos, for the first time in 70 years. Allow YouTube content?

US trade representative Robert Lighthizer has told industry
executives that the next round of tariffs on Chinese imports has
been put on hold. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was
up 150 points at 25,230, the S&P 500

Nasdaq Composite was up 102 points at 7,246. HSBC and China
Investment Corp are in talks to create a fund for the Chinese
sovereign wealth fund to invest in companies in Britain that
have business links with China, HSBC has said. The fund would be managed by London-based Charterhouse
Capital Partners, which is in talks with CIC and HSBC, the bank said. The three ""are in exclusive discussions to create a fund
to invest in high-quality and growing UK companies with
development opportunities in China,"" HSBC added. The Financial Times said the fund could be worth Â£1bn. The FT hascome up with a handy cut-out-and-keep flowchart,externalwhich succinctly sums up various possible outcomes of the Brexit process from here. So for example, if there is not a vote of no-confidence in Theresa May, and the Brexit agreement goes to a vote in Parliament, the proposed deal could be accepted or defeated. If it is defeated, Labour could propose a motion of no-confidence in the government. If that in turn is defeated, we could see no deal, more negotiations, or a second referendum. BBC and correspondents unpick the detail in the government's withdrawal agreement documents. Tesla Model 3s ordered in the US by the end of this month will be delivered by the end of the year, chief executive Elon Muskhas said,external, as the electric carmaker tries to take advantage of tax
breaks. The electric carmaker has until the end of the year to hand
out tax credits of $7,500 to customers. The prospect of talks toamend the draft dealis unlikely as an agreement is ""on the table"". Carmaker BMW is continuing to prepare for a no-deal Brexit, given
uncertainty around Prime Minister Theresa May's deal after
several of her ministers resigned in protest. BMW welcomed this week's draft withdrawal agreement as a
""positive step in the right direction"" but said the political
situation was uncertain. ""Uncertainty is not good for business. As a responsible
employer, we must therefore continue to prepare for the
worst-case scenario, which is what a no-deal Brexit would
represent,"" it said. ""We continue to call on all sides to work towards a final
agreement which maintains the truly frictionless trade on which
our international production network is based."" US stocks struggle as a rebound by tech companies from this week's
sharp losses is outweighed by Brexit-related concerns and a batch of weak results. Department store chain Dillard's fell 13.7% after reporting
third-quarter results, and shares in Walmart gave up gains to trade
down 1.5%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was
down 110 points at 24,970, the S&P 500
 was down was down 3 points at 2,698 and the

Where we are with Brexit,"This video can not be played Brexit: May under pressure over deal Theresa May has secured a deal with the European Union on the terms of Britain's exit on 29 March - and a joint statement on how future relations between the two might work. What happens now? The UK is due to leave the European Union at 23:00 GMT on Friday 29 March, 2019, after people voted by 51.9% to 48.1% for Leave in the 2016 referendum. The UK and the EU have spent more than a year trying to agree on how the divorce - as it's often called - will work in practice. This has now been agreed with the EU and backed by the cabinet, althoughtwo ministers resigned in protest at it.They have also agreed a rough outline of how future relations might work, known as the political declaration. Theresa May now has to get MPs to vote for the withdrawal agreement and the political declaration. A vote scheduled for Tuesday, 11 December was delayed by the prime minister until 21 January at the latest. If she eventually clears that hurdle, it will go to a vote in the European Parliament. There are two documents. Adraft 585-page agreement on Britain's withdrawal,externalfrom the European Union is a legally-binding text that sets out the terms of the UK's departure. It includes: Commitments over citizens' rights after Brexit - people will be able to work and study where they currently live, and to be joined by family members A 21-month transition period after the UK's departure, to allow time for trade talks The UK would continue to follow all EU rules during this period in order to give governments and businesses more time to prepare for long term changes A ""fair financial settlement"" from the UK - also known as the Â£39bn ""divorce bill"" A ""backstop"" arrangement to keep the Irish border unmanned if trade talks don't come up with a way of avoiding that happening More on how what the draft agreement reveals The other document isa 26-page statement on the UK's future relationship with the EU,external, when the transition period comes to an end. This is not legally-binding and contains wriggle room for both sides, based around the central ideal of continued close co-operation. The government has described it as ""a set of instructions to negotiators"" working on a legally-binding treaty. Formal negotiations on everything it contains can only begin after Brexit has actually happened on 29 March 2019. The declaration includes: Plans for a ""free trade area and deep co-operation on goods, with zero tariffs and quotas"" ""Ambitious customs arrangements"" that ""build on"" the arrangements in the withdrawal agreement Commitment to respect the EU's four freedoms - the free movement of people, goods, services and money around the EU A specific reference to the end of free movement in the UK A reference to allowing the UK to strike its own trade deals after Brexit An exit from the Common Agricultural Policy and the Common Fisheries Policy Determination to use technology to replace the Northern Irish ""backstop"" - but no guarantee A clear continuing role for the European Court of Justice in the interpretation of EU law Continued participation in EU programmes in areas like science, culture, education, overseas development and space, including ""a fair and appropriate financial contribution"" Continued co-operation on defence and security More on what's in the political declaration This was the major sticking point in talks with Brussels. Both sides are committed to avoiding a return to a visible Northern Ireland border with guard posts and checks. They believe that bringing them back would put the peace process at risk. So they agreed to put in place a ""backstop"" - a kind of safety net to ensure there is no hard border whatever the outcome of future trade talks between the UK and the EU. The backstop will mean that Northern Ireland would stay aligned to some EU rules on things like food products and goods standards. That will prevent the needs for checks on goods at the Irish border, but would require some products being brought to Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK to be subject to new checks and controls. The backstop would also involve a temporary single custom territory, effectively keeping the whole of the UK in the EU customs union. But Brexiteers do not like the prospect of being tied to EU customs rules and they say there's no process for the UK to unilaterally decide to exit the backstop - and Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party has said it will not tolerate anything that creates a new border down the Irish Sea. Mrs May insists she does not want to use the backstop and says it is highly unlikely that it will ever be triggered (her critics think otherwise). But if no trade deal is in prospect by July 2020, the two sides could agree to extend the transition period instead. This would avoid the need for the backstop at that time, and keep trade with the EU flowing as it does now. They could do this only once. The transition could not go on being extended indefinitely. But there is no agreement on how long any extension would be. Some have suggested the end of 2022, but the government position has been for it all to be sorted before the next election, which is due in Spring 2022. Either way, this could keep the UK under EU rules for at least three years after March's official Brexit date, something Brexiteers are also unhappy about. This video can not be played When will Brexit happen? As things stand, it looks unlikely. MPs were scheduled to vote on Tuesday, 11 December. However, the prime minister delayed the vote, admitting that ""widespread and deep concern"" over the Northern Ireland backstop meant the deal would have been rejected ""by a significant margin"". Mrs May said she would raise those concerns with EU leaders, and also look at ways to give MPs the power to force the government to ""ensure that the backstop cannot be in place indefinitely"" and has ""democratic legitimacy"". Downing Street has said it will be rescheduled for 21 January at the latest, although Brexit Minister Robin Walker told MPs he hoped it would be sooner. Before the vote was postponed, Labour and all the other opposition parties in the House of Commons had said they would vote against the deal. About 100 Conservative MPs have said will not support it, although some might abstain rather than actually voting against. And Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, who Mrs May relies on to keep her in power, have also said they will vote against it. Theresa May is hoping to persuade MPs that the deal not only delivers on the result of the EU referendum by allowing the UK to take back control of its ""money, laws and borders"" it is also the best the UK can get from the EU and there is no alternative on offer. She will also argue that if her deal is voted down, Britain risks leaving without a deal - a prospect feared by many MPs, who think it will cause chaos at the ports and damage industry - or, she says, there will be ""no Brexit at all"". Brexiteers say it is not what people voted for - and it could keep the UK tied to the EU indefinitely, without any say over its rules. Some have even argued that it would be worse than staying in the EU. Remainers also argue that it is a worse deal for the UK than staying in the EU. This video can not be played Radio 4 The World at One asks: What will happen if Parliament rejects the Brexit plan? It is hard to say for certain. There are number of possible scenarios, including: Leaving the EU without a deal Having another vote in Parliament - Mrs May will get three weeks to make a second attempt Another EU referendum (this can only happen if the government brings forward legislation to hold one and a majority in the Commons supports it) A general election - Labour's preferred option but it would need a no-confidence vote in the PM Theresa May is removed by her own MPs and a new leader tries to renegotiate a deal with the EU - Tory MPs say they are close to having enough signatures to trigger a confidence vote in her Some of these options would involve delaying the official Brexit date of 29 March by a few months to allow time to renegotiate a deal, if the EU agrees to that Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell has alsofloated the idea of Labour forming a minority governmentwithout a general election to have a go at getting its own version of Brexit - centred around a permanent customs union with the EU - through Parliament, although the party would then have to get the EU to agree to that.

What now for EU diplomats?,"EU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier spoke warmly about the draft deal Ashen-faced European diplomats haunt the corridors of Brussels. No rest for them until Sunday 25 November - the day of the ""seal the deal"" Brexit summit between Theresa May and EU leaders. So what do they have to do between now and then? Diplomats from the 27 EU countries must now pore over 585 pages of the draft Brexit withdrawal agreement with lawyers to ensure all will be to each government's liking. If a problem is identified, it will need to be transmitted to the team of Michel Barnier, the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, as early as this Friday or Saturday. The 27 member states (and Theresa May) also still have to agree what should be in the political declaration on the future EU-UK relationship. This part of the divorce treaty is not legally binding - but it is symbolically important. At the moment the text is solely made up of a series of bullet points and headings. So the pressure is definitely on, leading up to the 25th. What happened and what's next? Brexit deal: Does this mean everything is decided? A brief guide to where we are with Brexit But all this could be in vain if the Brexit deal is voted down by the UK parliament in a few weeks' time. The EU knows this is a very real possibility. I put the question to Michel Barnier on Wednesday night at his press conference - but, skilled politician that he is, he refused to engage. Brussels is very keen indeed not to give the impression that the EU might change or come up with a ""better"" Brexit deal text if this one ends up being rejected in the House of Commons. Mr Barnier quoted Theresa May as saying that this is a deal in the UK's interest. In fact, he spoke so warmly about the deal - how hard EU and UK negotiators had worked on it, how successful they had been in protecting citizens' rights, the Irish border and the constitutional integrity of the UK - that one colleague commented to me it was as if Mr Barnier, known for his suave French manner, believed they had managed to conjure an exquisitely designed Faberge egg out of the complex Brexit process. No wonder then that he didn't want to engage in the possibility of that egg getting smashed. This video can not be played Theresa May says she believes with her ""head and her heart"" that it is in the best interests of the UK Truth be told, he's unlikely to face much trouble from the EU side. He is off to Strasbourg on Thursday to schmooze the European parliament - which has a veto over the Brexit deal. MEPs will look at the section of the withdrawal agreement on citizens' right with a particularly critical eye as that is the issue they tend most to focus on. But Mr Barnier has been careful to keep the parliament in the loop on negotiations throughout, so they're unlikely to reject a final agreement. Reality Check: When is the crunch time? EU countries had also given Ireland an effective veto over the deal if Dublin were unhappy about the provisions for the Irish border. But the Irish prime minister gave the green light to the draft text on Wednesday, so that is no longer an issue. Spain and Gibraltar, and Cyprus and the UK military bases on the island were also thought to be potential pitfalls. The withdrawal agreement sorted them out too. This leaves the concerns the UK's biggest EU trade partners (like France and Germany) had over the so-called ""level playing field"": ensuring that the UK was tied to extra EU regulations in the temporary customs relationship outlined in the Irish backstop, should it one day be triggered. Well, about 100 pages of the draft withdrawal treaty are dedicated to these extra ties - on state aid, environment and labour regulations - ensuring that UK business should not have a competitive advantage over EU ones in a customs partnership. Rights to fish in UK waters after Brexit have not yet been agreed, and the Spanish, French, Danish or Dutch will probably have something to say about that - but it's not a deal breaker at this stage. So, those Europeans wary of political trouble that could disrupt or destroy the careful Brexit deal choreography between now and 25 November (and beyond) look fearfully at the politically volatile UK. This led one EU civil servant late on Wednesday night to jab at the 585 pages of the draft Brexit treaty, muttering: ""You know what? All this could still end up in the bin.""

Arrests over 2016 murder of Ohio family,"Three generations of the same family are facing charges related to the murders. Police in Ohio have arrested a family of four who are suspected of killing eight members of another family on their cannabis farm in 2016. The murder of the Rhoden family was ""meticulously planned"" and was related to a child custody dispute, police say. The Wagner family, who have been arrested, moved to Alaska after the crime and later returned to Ohio. Ohio's attorney general said the suspects ""spent months planning the crime"" but made mistakes along the way. ""The killers knew the territory and meticulously planned these murders,"" Attorney General Mike DeWine said. George ""Billy"" Wagner III, 47, and Angela Wagner, 48, and their two sons, 27-year-old George Wagner IV and 26-year-old Edward ""Jake"" Wagner were arrested on Tuesday in connection the 2016 killings. They face more than 80 criminal charges, including eight counts of aggravated murder which could land them on death row. It's unclear if the Wagners have a lawyer, but they have previously denied committing the murder several times over the course of the two-year investigation. In addition, Mrs Wagner's 65-year-old mother, Rita Newcomb, and Billy Wagner's 76-year-old mother, Fredericka Wagner, have also been charged with obstruction of justice and perjury. They are not believed to have taken part in the killings, according to police. On 22 April 2016, eight members of the Rhoden family were shot to death in four separate homes on their family farm in Pike County, Ohio - about 100 miles (150km) from Cincinnati - ""under cover of darkness"", Mr DeWine said. They were identified as Hannah Gilley, 20; Christopher Rhoden, Sr, 40; Christopher Rhoden, Jr, 16; Clarence ""Frankie"" Rhoden, 20; Dana Rhoden, 37; Gary Rhoden, 38; Hanna Rhoden, 19, and Kenneth Rhoden, 44. The victims were found in their beds, and appeared to have been asleep, according to investigators. A four-day old infant, a six-month old baby, and a three-year-old child were all spared during the attack. Jake Wagner was the long-time boyfriend of victim Hanna Rhoden, and shared custody of their daughter Sophia. Sophia, now five years old, was not present at the family home at the time of the murders, and is in child protective custody, according to police. ""There certainly was obsession with custody, obsession with control of children,"" Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine said. He declined to provide further details regarding their alleged motive. Eight killed in Ohio gun rampage ""This is just the most bizarre story I've ever seen,"" he said, adding that it ""has been by far the longest, most complex and labour intensive investigation the Ohio Attorney General's Office has ever undertaken"". Jake Wagner is also accused of sexual contact with a minor in connection to his relationship with Hanna Rhoden, who was 15 at the time. He was 20 when they first started dating. Mr DeWine, who was elected last week as Ohio's next governor, said the Wagners used their familiarity with the Rhodens to plot their murders. ""They knew what they were doing. They thought about it. A lot,"" Mr DeWine said at a news conference on Tuesday. ""They were brutally and viciously executed,"" he continued. ""The killers knew the territory and meticulously planned these horrendous murders."" During the investigation, Angela Wagner told local media that Hannah Rhoden ""was like a daughter"" to her and called the killers ""monsters"". Her husband, Billy Wagner, was also said to be close friends with victim Kenneth Rhoden. Pike County Sheriff Charles Reader, who was nearly brought to tears during the news conference, told reporters: ""Members of one family conspired, planned, carried out and then allegedly covered up their violent act to wipe out members of another family."" ""They did this quickly, coldly, calmly and very carefully - but not carefully enough. ""They left traces, they left a trail - the parts to build a silencer, the forged documents, the cameras, cell phones, all that they tampered with. And the lies, all the lies they told us."" There are 'multiple crime scenes' in Piketon, Ohio During the investigation, about 100 cannabis plants were found on the victims' property, and officials had initially speculated that the murders could be drug-related. Mr DeWine said the drugs were unrelated to the motive, but that the probe did include ""an undercurrent of drugs"".

"Most pubs 'don't stop children gambling'Nine out of ten pubs do not prevent teenagers from using gaming machines, Gambling Commission saysBusiness","Only 10% of pubs intervene to stop children gambling on their premises, the Gambling Commission has found. The watchdog said it had found a ""concerning"" number of pubs where youngsters used gaming machines. Pub staff are expected to prevent under-18s playing on the machines and there should be clear signage indicating the age restriction. The British Beer and Pub Association said it took the findings ""very seriously"". The Gambling Commission said it had been working with local police and licensing authorities to check pubs were acting within the law. Teenagers 'bombarded by gambling ads' Reality Check: Is the watershed still relevant? It said the 89% rate of failure - found across a sample of pubs - was much worse than the 15% to 30% failure rate seen in other industries selling age-restricted products, such as alcohol or tobacco. Helen Rhodes, programme director at the Gambling Commission, said: ""We are extremely concerned that pubs across England are failing to stop children playing gaming machines designed for adults. ""We urgently call on the pub sector to take action immediately to enforce the laws in place to protect children and young people."" Brigid Simmonds, chief executive of the British Beer and Pub Association (BBPA), said that pubs should offer a ""safe and friendly environment for families"". ""We have ensured that all of our members are aware of both the BBPA's and Gambling Commission's codes of practice and we are already taking steps to develop a social charter for responsible gambling, for use by licensees and pub companies. ""However given the importance of this issue we are seeking urgent meetings with the Gambling Commission and local authorities to ensure appropriate action is taken."" On Tuesdaythe government promised to bring forward a cutto the maximum bet on fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs) amid pressure from MPs. It had originally planned to reduce the stake from Â£100 to Â£2 in October next year, but will now do so from April. FOBTs have been criticised for encouraging excessive gambling and exposing people to the risk of addiction, and the social, mental and financial problems associated with gambling.

"Uber loss tops $1bn ahead of planned IPOThe ride-sharing firm's losses grew in the third quarter, with a slight rise in revenues and bookings.Business","Uber posted a loss of $1.07bn (Â£821m) in the three months to September, as the ride-sharing firm prepares for a public stock offering next year. The US company's net losses widened sharply on a quarterly basis as revenues rose only slightly. Uber was recently valued at $72bn, making it one of the most valuable privately held firms in the world.

But losses were down 27% compared to the same period last year, according to Reuters. ""We had another strong quarter for a business of our size and global scope,"" Uber chief financial officer Nelson Chai said in a statement.

PM faces grilling amid Brexit deal backlash,"This video can not be played Theresa May says she believes with her ""head and her heart"" that it is in the best interests of the UK Theresa May faces a grilling from MPs later over the draft Brexit agreement the UK has reached with the EU. The PM secured her cabinet's backing for the deal after a five-hour meeting but Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab has just resigned over it. She has also faced a backlash from Tory Brexiteers and her Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) backers, amid suggestions of moves to force a no-confidence vote. Labour will announce later whether or not it will back the deal. However, leader Jeremy Corbyn said he did not believe the agreement - set out in a585-page document,external- was in the national interest. Latest updates: PM to face MPs Kuenssberg: What happened and what's next? Reality Check: What does the draft withdrawal agreement reveal? A brief guide to where we are with Brexit Junior NI minister quits over Brexit deal Speaking on Thursday morning, the president of the European Council, Donald Tusk, said he still saw Brexit as a ""lose-lose"" situation. But he added: ""As much as I am sad to see you leave, I will do everything to make this farewell the least painful possible, for you and for us."" Mr Tusk also confirmed that ""if nothing extraordinary happens"", an emergency EU summit will take place on 25 November to ""finalise and formalise"" the Brexit agreement.

Mrs May is due to give a statement to the House of Commons on Thursday morning - this is likely to be a lengthy event, giving MPs the chance to question and put their views to her directly. It comes the day after she emerged from the marathon cabinet meeting on Wednesday evening and declared the choice before the UK to be clear. ""This deal, which delivers on the vote of the referendum, which brings back control of our money, laws and borders, ends free movement, protects jobs, security and our Union; or leave with no deal, or no Brexit at all."" The EU said the agreement marked ""decisive progress"", clearing the way for a special summit of EU leaders to approve it. This video can not be played When will Brexit happen? However, Brexiteer MPs were angered by a ""backstop"" provision allowing the creation of a temporary ""EU-UK single customs territory"" to prevent border checks in Ireland in the event no trade deal is in place. They fear it could leave the UK tied to EU rules for years. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg says the threat of cabinet resignations remains live and that the prime minister could yet face a challenge to her leadership on Thursday. Assuming she survives in post, Mrs May will face a battle to get the agreement through the House of Commons ahead of the UK's exit from the EU on 29 March. She held talks with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, DUP leader Arlene Foster and Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon on Wednesday evening. A draft agreement on the UK's withdrawal from the EU, and a statement setting out what the two sides want their future relationship to look like. The withdrawal agreement covers so-called ""divorce"" issues. It includes a commitment to protect the rights of EU nationals in the UK and Britons in the EU to continue living, working and studying. There is also a planned 21-month transition period after the UK leaves the EU in March 2019, and a ""financial settlement"" from the UK, thought to be between Â£35bn and Â£39bn. The most contentious part of the negotiations has been the ""backstop"", which aims to guarantee that physical checks will not be reintroduced at the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic, whatever long-term arrangements are agreed further down the line. Please upgrade your browser The backstop will mean that Northern Ireland would stay aligned to some EU rules on things like food products and goods standards. That will prevent the needs for checks on goods at the Irish border, but would require some products being brought to Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK to be subject to new checks and controls. The backstop would also involve a temporary single custom territory, effectively keeping the whole of the UK in the EU customs union. Brexiteers are angry about the prospect of being tied to EU customs rules long-term, particularly as the arrangement could only be terminated by mutual consent of Brussels and London. Meanwhile, the DUP has said it will not tolerate anything that creates a new border down the Irish sea. Both sides have resolved to ensure the backstop is not necessary by coming up with alternative arrangements. By BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg The threat of resignations is still live. Esther McVey, the work and pensions secretary, seems the most likely to go, followed by the International Development Secretary, Penny Mordaunt. And there is silence tonight and a lot of chatter about the position of the Brexit Secretary, Dominic Raab. One might not be a problem for the PM. The departure of either Mordaunt or Raab or both, both of whom harbour ambitions for the top job, would be very dangerous for No 10. Just as immediately - Brexiteer backbenchers are furious, just like the DUP. And it is possible that the Parliamentary postman will be extremely busy on Thursday with letters that might trigger a challenge to Mrs May. One senior Tory told me on Wednesday night there is likely to be a move against the prime minister in the next 24 hours. Another said they would be amazed if enough objections to start a contest hadn't emerged by lunchtime. Read more from Laura DUP leader Arlene Foster described her meeting with Mrs May as ""frank"". ""She is fully aware of our position and concerns,"" she tweeted. Ms Sturgeon said Scotland was not mentioned in the agreement which she said ""disregards our interests, and puts Scotland at a serious competitive disadvantage"". Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar praised Mrs May for ""honouring her promise"" to prevent a hard border. He said Wednesday had been ""one of the better days in politics"", and avoiding a hard border had been ""one of the most difficult challenges"" of the process. But prominent Conservative Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg, who has written to MPs urging them to oppose the proposals, told BBC Radio 5 Live it was ""a pretty rotten deal"", keeping the UK in the EU's customs union and ""splitting up"" the UK. From the pro-European side of the debate, the Best for Britain campaign said Mrs May had ""sacrificed the national interest in favour of her own preservation"". The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) said the agreement was ""progress"" as it moved the UK ""one step away from the nightmare precipice of no deal"", while the Freight Transport Association and the National Farmers' Union also welcomed the publication. By Katya Adler, BBC Europe editor Brussels is very keen indeed not to give the impression that the EU might change or come up with a ""better"" Brexit deal text if this one ends up being rejected in the House of Commons. Mr Barnier quoted Theresa May as saying that this is a deal in the UK's interest. In fact, he spoke so warmly about the deal - how hard EU and UK negotiators had worked on it, how successful they had been in protecting citizens' rights, the Irish border and the constitutional integrity of the UK - that one colleague commented to me it was as if Mr Barnier, known for his suave French manner, believed they had managed to conjure an exquisitely designed Faberge egg out of the complex Brexit process. No wonder then that he didn't want to engage in the possibility of that egg getting smashed.

What are the plans to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland after Brexit? Theresa May has agreed a draft Brexit deal with Brussels. What happens now? Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn have been out and about, setting out their stall on Brexit. We've also heard from the former Brexit secretary who resigned last week and Sir Graham Brady, the Tory MP who knows more than anyone how close the prime minister is to facing a no confidence vote. Here are some key lines:  Adam FlemingBrussels reporter The European Commission has
proposed 31 December, 2022 as the ultimate end date for a possible
extension to the post-Brexit transition or implementation period, according to
a diplomatic note of a meeting between Michel Barnier and EU27 ambassadors in
Brussels this afternoon. The EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier also said that the
UK is still pushing for a Chequers-style free trade area in goods with a common
rule-book to be included in the political declaration on the future
relationship. There was a divide between member
states that want an ambitious trading relationship with the UK and those who
want Britainâs access to the single market to be more constrained. The UK wants to maintain the
status quo on internal security, which is also âa problem,â ambassadors were
told. The final political declaration
could be between 14 and 20 pages long. Spain raised serious concerns
about Gibraltar, which officials fear could grow in the coming days. Michel Barnier said the political
situation in the UK was âvolatile.â A diplomat said the message from
the EUâs Brexit negotiators to the member states was âkeep a lid on your
concerns for now and weâll deal with them in the negotiations on the future
relationship."". The European Council is also
planning to issue conclusions which will go alongside the withdrawal agreement
and the political declaration when they are endorsed at the special summit next
week. New York Times The New York Times hastaken a quizzical look,externalat how Theresa May could be ousted as prime minister.  In a secret location, the chairman of a panel called the 1922 Committee was collecting poison-pen letters from rebels within Mrs Mayâs Conservative Party, calling for her to be removed as leader.  The number of letters is secret except to the chairman, Graham Brady, but once their number reaches 48, the committee â also known as âthe men in gray suitsâ â can demand a vote of all 315 Conservative members of Parliament. If she doesnât win half the votes, she will be forced to resign.  This is the way political death comes in Britain, speedily and stealthily.""  The Andrew Marr Show Nicola Sturgeon has confirmed her SNP MPs will vote against Theresa May's Brexit deal. The First Minister rejected claims her Westminster MPs could abstain on the vote in the House of Commons. The SNP leader told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show it would be ""deeply irresponsible"" for any MPs to endorse the prime minister's agreement, published last week. And she revealed she will be heading to London to talk to opposition parties about alternatives in the coming days. The SNP has 35 MPs at Westminster. Labour has said it will oppose the draft agreement in the crunch Commons vote, and the DUP - which props up the Tory government in key votes - has also criticised the proposals. Read more More from the DUP's Nigel Dodds, who has described the draft withdrawal deal as ""dangerous"". ""This deal would place a trade border in the Irish Sea, subject us to EU rules without any power to influence or change them and binds us to the EU with no unilateral ability to leave. Indeed, Northern Ireland is part of the EU customs union not the UK's."" Former first secretary of state Damian Green is an ally of Theresa May, so it's no surprise that he is strongly against any challenge to her leadership. If you step back, we are at the absolute crunch point of the most important negotiations this country has had for decades. I think saying that what the country now needs - let alone the Conservative Party, look at it on a national basis - to say that what the country now needs is a leadership election and a change of leadership, is absurd. From the country's point of view, I think that's exactly the wrong way to go.""  The Democratic Unionist Party, whose 10 MPs give Theresa May vital support in key votes, is not happy about the draft agreement, saying it could create a new border down the Irish Sea by making Northern Ireland follow different trade rules to the rest of the UK. Deputy leader Nigel Dodds said: ""I understand why some people fear a 'no deal' scenario. ""But the choice is between this very bad deal and the right
deal. ""With MPs on all sides of the House
pointing to the dangers for the Union of the Withdrawal
Agreement, it is clear that it is time to work for a better deal
which does not undermine the integrity of the United Kingdom.""  Catherine Haddon, of the Institute for Government think
tank, said the 25 November EU summit would probably have to be postponed if May loses a
vote of confidence. She would still be prime minister until a new Tory leader was elected, unless she resigned and handed over to a caretaker PM. âIt would have implications for the negotiations because we
donât know what the position of the new prime minister would be,â Ms Haddon told BBC
News. Appointing a caretaker PM would be âquite problematicâ because
the party is divided and would be unlikely to agree on a suitable candidate. The whole Tory leadership process takes about two months,
although they could shorten it, but they would âhave to say to the EU, and the
public, we will come back in January and try to get through the leadership
contest between now and thenâ. That would take us even closer to the 29 March, the
scheduled departure date, and make it even tighter to get the required Brexit
legislation through Parliament in time. Tory MPs will be conscious of the time pressure and if she
survives this week then the chances of her being ousted are reduced, argued Ms
Haddon. She could face another âpressure pointâ when MPs vote on the
deal, which might lead to another attempt to get her out. If she won a  vote of confidence it would âstrengthen
her hand quite considerably,â she adds. The BBC's Europe editor tweets...  Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Rob WatsonBBC political correspondent This time next week Theresa May hopes to be in Brussels finalising her Brexit plan with EU leaders. In the meantime she's fighting off challenges at home not just to that plan but her very leadership. Her message to hardline Brexiteers within the Conservative Party - getting rid of me won't make Brexit any easier. So far those Brexiteers have yet to muster the numbers against her for a vote of no confidence, though that could come any minute or any day. Whatever happens, whether she survives any leadership challenge or not,  the Conservative party now seems in a state of open civil war over Brexit with unforeseeable consequences for Britain's departure from the EU. The World This WeekendRadio 4 programme John Whittingdale, a former culture secretary, is one of the Conservative MPs who have submitted a letter calling for the prime minister to stand down. ""When you have a succession of resignations of the numbers that we have seen, not just this week, but when the Chequers Agreement was published, it does look like a government in disarray and it's very hard to reach any other conclusion. ""But that is because we are pushing ahead with a deal that commands very little support in the Conservative Party, is opposed in Parliament and certainly on the basis of my discussions with my own constituents, commands virtually no support in the country."" The World This WeekendRadio 4 programme Another Conservative association chair, councillor Tom Ashton of the Boston and Skegness association where people voted overwhelmingly for Brexit, says Mrs May should stay - for now. ""I wouldn't support a leadership challenge at this stage,"" he said. ""I feel she deserves the chance now to bring the deal that she's speaking of before Parliament. ""But if you cannot get a deal through, then I think it'll be up to party colleagues in Parliament 
to consider their options,"" he added. The BBC's Andrew Marr clashes with Baroness Chakrabarti, Labour's shadow attorney general, during a discussion about Brexit. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
A guide to where we are with BrexitReality Check: What does draft agreement reveal?Laura Kuenssberg: What happened and what's next?Video,"This video can not be played Brexit: May under pressure over deal Theresa May has secured a deal with the European Union on the terms of Britain's exit on 29 March - and a joint statement on how future relations between the two might work. What happens now? The UK is due to leave the European Union at 23:00 GMT on Friday 29 March, 2019, after people voted by 51.9% to 48.1% for Leave in the 2016 referendum. The UK and the EU have spent more than a year trying to agree on how the divorce - as it's often called - will work in practice. This has now been agreed with the EU and backed by the cabinet, althoughtwo ministers resigned in protest at it.They have also agreed a rough outline of how future relations might work, known as the political declaration. Theresa May now has to get MPs to vote for the withdrawal agreement and the political declaration. A vote scheduled for Tuesday, 11 December was delayed by the prime minister until 21 January at the latest. If she eventually clears that hurdle, it will go to a vote in the European Parliament. There are two documents. Adraft 585-page agreement on Britain's withdrawal,externalfrom the European Union is a legally-binding text that sets out the terms of the UK's departure. It includes: Commitments over citizens' rights after Brexit - people will be able to work and study where they currently live, and to be joined by family members A 21-month transition period after the UK's departure, to allow time for trade talks The UK would continue to follow all EU rules during this period in order to give governments and businesses more time to prepare for long term changes A ""fair financial settlement"" from the UK - also known as the Â£39bn ""divorce bill"" A ""backstop"" arrangement to keep the Irish border unmanned if trade talks don't come up with a way of avoiding that happening More on how what the draft agreement reveals The other document isa 26-page statement on the UK's future relationship with the EU,external, when the transition period comes to an end. This is not legally-binding and contains wriggle room for both sides, based around the central ideal of continued close co-operation. The government has described it as ""a set of instructions to negotiators"" working on a legally-binding treaty. Formal negotiations on everything it contains can only begin after Brexit has actually happened on 29 March 2019. The declaration includes: Plans for a ""free trade area and deep co-operation on goods, with zero tariffs and quotas"" ""Ambitious customs arrangements"" that ""build on"" the arrangements in the withdrawal agreement Commitment to respect the EU's four freedoms - the free movement of people, goods, services and money around the EU A specific reference to the end of free movement in the UK A reference to allowing the UK to strike its own trade deals after Brexit An exit from the Common Agricultural Policy and the Common Fisheries Policy Determination to use technology to replace the Northern Irish ""backstop"" - but no guarantee A clear continuing role for the European Court of Justice in the interpretation of EU law Continued participation in EU programmes in areas like science, culture, education, overseas development and space, including ""a fair and appropriate financial contribution"" Continued co-operation on defence and security More on what's in the political declaration This was the major sticking point in talks with Brussels. Both sides are committed to avoiding a return to a visible Northern Ireland border with guard posts and checks. They believe that bringing them back would put the peace process at risk. So they agreed to put in place a ""backstop"" - a kind of safety net to ensure there is no hard border whatever the outcome of future trade talks between the UK and the EU. The backstop will mean that Northern Ireland would stay aligned to some EU rules on things like food products and goods standards. That will prevent the needs for checks on goods at the Irish border, but would require some products being brought to Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK to be subject to new checks and controls. The backstop would also involve a temporary single custom territory, effectively keeping the whole of the UK in the EU customs union. But Brexiteers do not like the prospect of being tied to EU customs rules and they say there's no process for the UK to unilaterally decide to exit the backstop - and Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party has said it will not tolerate anything that creates a new border down the Irish Sea. Mrs May insists she does not want to use the backstop and says it is highly unlikely that it will ever be triggered (her critics think otherwise). But if no trade deal is in prospect by July 2020, the two sides could agree to extend the transition period instead. This would avoid the need for the backstop at that time, and keep trade with the EU flowing as it does now. They could do this only once. The transition could not go on being extended indefinitely. But there is no agreement on how long any extension would be. Some have suggested the end of 2022, but the government position has been for it all to be sorted before the next election, which is due in Spring 2022. Either way, this could keep the UK under EU rules for at least three years after March's official Brexit date, something Brexiteers are also unhappy about. This video can not be played When will Brexit happen? As things stand, it looks unlikely. MPs were scheduled to vote on Tuesday, 11 December. However, the prime minister delayed the vote, admitting that ""widespread and deep concern"" over the Northern Ireland backstop meant the deal would have been rejected ""by a significant margin"". Mrs May said she would raise those concerns with EU leaders, and also look at ways to give MPs the power to force the government to ""ensure that the backstop cannot be in place indefinitely"" and has ""democratic legitimacy"". Downing Street has said it will be rescheduled for 21 January at the latest, although Brexit Minister Robin Walker told MPs he hoped it would be sooner. Before the vote was postponed, Labour and all the other opposition parties in the House of Commons had said they would vote against the deal. About 100 Conservative MPs have said will not support it, although some might abstain rather than actually voting against. And Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, who Mrs May relies on to keep her in power, have also said they will vote against it. Theresa May is hoping to persuade MPs that the deal not only delivers on the result of the EU referendum by allowing the UK to take back control of its ""money, laws and borders"" it is also the best the UK can get from the EU and there is no alternative on offer. She will also argue that if her deal is voted down, Britain risks leaving without a deal - a prospect feared by many MPs, who think it will cause chaos at the ports and damage industry - or, she says, there will be ""no Brexit at all"". Brexiteers say it is not what people voted for - and it could keep the UK tied to the EU indefinitely, without any say over its rules. Some have even argued that it would be worse than staying in the EU. Remainers also argue that it is a worse deal for the UK than staying in the EU. This video can not be played Radio 4 The World at One asks: What will happen if Parliament rejects the Brexit plan? It is hard to say for certain. There are number of possible scenarios, including: Leaving the EU without a deal Having another vote in Parliament - Mrs May will get three weeks to make a second attempt Another EU referendum (this can only happen if the government brings forward legislation to hold one and a majority in the Commons supports it) A general election - Labour's preferred option but it would need a no-confidence vote in the PM Theresa May is removed by her own MPs and a new leader tries to renegotiate a deal with the EU - Tory MPs say they are close to having enough signatures to trigger a confidence vote in her Some of these options would involve delaying the official Brexit date of 29 March by a few months to allow time to renegotiate a deal, if the EU agrees to that Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell has alsofloated the idea of Labour forming a minority governmentwithout a general election to have a go at getting its own version of Brexit - centred around a permanent customs union with the EU - through Parliament, although the party would then have to get the EU to agree to that.

Reality Check: What does draft agreement reveal?Laura Kuenssberg: What happened and what's next?Video,"This video can not be played The Brexit agreement summarised in two minutes The draft withdrawal agreement is all about how the UK leaves the European Union. It's not about any permanent future relationship. It's a long read - 585 pages long,external- and we've just had a first look at the text. There will be plenty more to say in the days ahead. But what's in this draft document, that some people thought might never materialise? Well we've known about a lot of the content for some time. There are details of the financial settlement (often dubbed the divorce bill) that the two sides agreed some months ago: over time, it means the UK will pay at least Â£39bn to the EU to cover all its financial obligations. There's also a long section on citizens' rights after Brexit for EU citizens in the UK and Brits elsewhere in Europe. It maintains their existing residency rights, but big questions remain about a host of issues, including the rights of UK citizens to work across borders elsewhere in the EU. The legal basis for a transition (or implementation) period, beginning after Brexit. It would be 21 months during which the UK would continue to follow all European Union rules (in order to give governments and businesses more time to prepare for long term change). That means that during transition, the UK would remain under the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice (in fact, the ECJ is mentioned more than 60 times in this document). The document says that decisions adopted by European Union institutions during this period ""shall be binding on and in the United Kingdom"". The transition period is also designed to allow time for the UK and the EU to reach a trade deal. The draft agreement says both sides will use their ""best endeavours"" to ensure that a long term trade deal is in place by the end of 2020. Significantly, if more time is needed, the option of extending the transition appears in the document (although, it makes it clear that the UK would have to pay for it). The document doesn't say how long the transition could be extended for (in fact they've left the date blank), only that the Joint Committee may take a decision ""extending the transition period up to [31 December 20XX]."" UK officials hope that the date will be clarified by the time of the proposed EU summit on 25 November. If there was no long term trade agreement and no extension of the transition, that's when the so-called ""backstop"" would kick in. It's the issue that has dominated negotiations for the last few weeks and months: how to ensure that no hard border (with checks or physical infrastructure) emerges after Brexit between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Both sides agreed back in December 2017 that there should be a guarantee to avoid a hard border under all circumstances. That guarantee came to be known as the backstop, but agreeing a legal text proved very difficult. So what exactly does this draft agreement say about the border, the backstop and the legal guarantees that underpin it? If a backstop is needed, it will - as expected - take the form of a temporary customs union encompassing not just Northern Ireland but the whole of the UK. The draft agreement describes this as a ""single customs territory"". Northern Ireland, though, will be in a deeper customs relationship with the EU than Great Britain, and even more closely tied to the rules of the EU single market. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. One policy area is excluded from these potential customs arrangements: fishing. That's because the trade-off between access for UK fish produce to EU markets, and access for EU boats to UK waters, is too controversial. The draft agreement simply states that ""the Union and the United Kingdom shall use their best endeavours to conclude and ratify"" an agreement ""on access to waters and fishing opportunities"". There are also details of one of the last issues to be negotiated - the terms on which the UK may be able to leave this temporary customs arrangement in the future. If either party notifies the other that it wants the backstop to come to an end, a joint ministerial committee will meet within six months to consider the details. But the backstop (which is part of the Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland) would only cease to apply if ""the Union and the United Kingdom decide jointly"" that it is no longer necessary. In other words, the UK will not have a unilateral right to bring those arrangements to an end. For some Brexiteers, that is simply unacceptable. A guide to where we are with Brexit But, don't forget, other countries will also have their concerns. They too will focus on the language surrounding a temporary customs union, to ensure that nothing is hidden there which could, in their view, give the UK rights without responsibilities; and - potentially - a competitive advantage. The EU insists the draft agreement ""includes the corresponding level playing field commitments and appropriate enforcement mechanisms to ensure fair competition between the EU27 and the UK."" So, it's not just in London that this document will be closely scrutinised. Finally one big question: to what extent could these temporary customs arrangements form the basis for a permanent future relationship, which can only be negotiated formally after Brexit has actually happened?

Laura Kuenssberg: What happened and what's next?Video,"Regular readers know that I am sometimes, especially at an uncertain moment, fond of making a list. On Wednesday night, the prime minister has taken a big step forward on the path to taking the UK out of the EU without a giant political accident. It's not been a pretty process so far, and five hours of cabinet discussion was not easy either. But again, she made it this far. Surviving tonight, though, does not mean surviving Thursday. So what happened and what's next? The most important fact on Wednesday night - Theresa May has a draft divorce deal with the EU that sorts out how and when we leave, and gives the outline of what the relationship will be like for decades to come. Given how difficult it's been to get this far and how uncertain it's been that she would make it to this point, that is a big achievement. The cabinet backed her, but not exactly with glad hearts. Depending who you ask, either about 10 of its members objected properly to the deal, or about 10 of them expressed a few doubts but didn't have any alternatives to give. The truth is probably somewhere in between. A source in the room told me the sense was that most of them knew this was the only real choice, but none of them wanted it to be done in their name. Having talked to a few people who were present the sense was a reluctant inevitability. And backing from Michael Gove and Geoffrey Cox was key to making that that happen. The cabinet is still pretty divided on the substance of the deal. Although they are now bound by collective responsibility, that means in these trying days ahead, Theresa May can't rely on having colleagues on tap ready to fight for her deal on air, in the Commons tearooms and even in the division lobbies on the crucial night when the vote takes place. The threat of resignations is still live. Esther McVey, the work and pensions secretary, seems the most likely to go, followed by the International Development Secretary, Penny Mordaunt. And there is silence tonight and a lot of chatter about the position of the Brexit Secretary, Dominic Raab (update:Raab resigned on Thursday morning). One might not be a problem for the PM. The departure of either Mordaunt or Raab or both, both of whom harbour ambitions for the top job, would be very dangerous for Number 10. Just as immediately - Brexiteer backbenchers are furious, just like the DUP. And it is possible that the Parliamentary postman will be extremely busy tomorrow with letters that might trigger a challenge to Mrs May.

In pictures: Melania Trump's whistle-stop Africa tour,"Melania Trump visited a Kenyan elephant orphanage on Friday where she bottle-fed one of the babies. She was given one of them to adopt. US First Lady Melania Trump is visiting Ghana, Malawi, Kenya and Egypt to promote children's welfare on what is her first major foreign trip alone. President Donald Trump has not visited Africa since taking office in January 2017. In February, a row broke out afterhe allegedly used ""shithole"" to describe some African nations. Mrs Trump's week-long trip to the continent is seen as an attempt to heal some of the divisions. The US First Lady's decision to wear a pith helmet on safari in Kenya has drawn criticism. The 19th Century headgear is seen by some as symbolic of colonial rule. Her tour began in Accra on Tuesday where she later took tea with Ghana's first lady and visited a healthcare clinic. These Ghanaian women in the capital, Accra, did not look overly impressed as Mrs Trump's motorcade passed by. She visited a former slave fort the next day and is pictured here in the ""Door of No Return"" - the last bit of African soil slaves touched before being sent to the Americas. Cape Coast Castle was a major outpost on the Atlantic slave trading route. ""What happened so many years ago is really a tragedy,"" she said. Like many first ladies, Melania Trump has chosen to use her platform to discuss issues affecting children. Her tour of four African nations is to be completed within less than a week. Malawi's First Lady Gertrude Maseko welcomed her US counterpart on Thursday. Mrs Trump met children at a primary school in Malawi's capital, Lilongwe. The US First Lady watched an outdoor lesson at the school in Malawi In Egypt, Mrs Trump visited the Giza pyramids near Cairo Sporting a Panama hat, the First Lady also posed for the cameras in front of the Sphinx Mrs Trump was welcomed to Cairo by her Egyptian counterpart, First Lady Intissar Amer al-Sisi Pictures from AFP and Reuters Africa's top shots: Taxi hats, weddings and hot chillies Africa Today podcasts Â© 2025 BBC.

"Arrests over 2016 murder of Ohio familyA family is suspected of a ""meticulously planned"" murder of another family on their rural farm.US & Canada","Three generations of the same family are facing charges related to the murders. Police in Ohio have arrested a family of four who are suspected of killing eight members of another family on their cannabis farm in 2016. The murder of the Rhoden family was ""meticulously planned"" and was related to a child custody dispute, police say. The Wagner family, who have been arrested, moved to Alaska after the crime and later returned to Ohio. Ohio's attorney general said the suspects ""spent months planning the crime"" but made mistakes along the way. ""The killers knew the territory and meticulously planned these murders,"" Attorney General Mike DeWine said. George ""Billy"" Wagner III, 47, and Angela Wagner, 48, and their two sons, 27-year-old George Wagner IV and 26-year-old Edward ""Jake"" Wagner were arrested on Tuesday in connection the 2016 killings. They face more than 80 criminal charges, including eight counts of aggravated murder which could land them on death row. It's unclear if the Wagners have a lawyer, but they have previously denied committing the murder several times over the course of the two-year investigation. In addition, Mrs Wagner's 65-year-old mother, Rita Newcomb, and Billy Wagner's 76-year-old mother, Fredericka Wagner, have also been charged with obstruction of justice and perjury. They are not believed to have taken part in the killings, according to police. On 22 April 2016, eight members of the Rhoden family were shot to death in four separate homes on their family farm in Pike County, Ohio - about 100 miles (150km) from Cincinnati - ""under cover of darkness"", Mr DeWine said. They were identified as Hannah Gilley, 20; Christopher Rhoden, Sr, 40; Christopher Rhoden, Jr, 16; Clarence ""Frankie"" Rhoden, 20; Dana Rhoden, 37; Gary Rhoden, 38; Hanna Rhoden, 19, and Kenneth Rhoden, 44. The victims were found in their beds, and appeared to have been asleep, according to investigators. A four-day old infant, a six-month old baby, and a three-year-old child were all spared during the attack. Jake Wagner was the long-time boyfriend of victim Hanna Rhoden, and shared custody of their daughter Sophia. Sophia, now five years old, was not present at the family home at the time of the murders, and is in child protective custody, according to police. ""There certainly was obsession with custody, obsession with control of children,"" Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine said. He declined to provide further details regarding their alleged motive. Eight killed in Ohio gun rampage ""This is just the most bizarre story I've ever seen,"" he said, adding that it ""has been by far the longest, most complex and labour intensive investigation the Ohio Attorney General's Office has ever undertaken"". Jake Wagner is also accused of sexual contact with a minor in connection to his relationship with Hanna Rhoden, who was 15 at the time. He was 20 when they first started dating. Mr DeWine, who was elected last week as Ohio's next governor, said the Wagners used their familiarity with the Rhodens to plot their murders. ""They knew what they were doing. They thought about it. A lot,"" Mr DeWine said at a news conference on Tuesday. ""They were brutally and viciously executed,"" he continued. ""The killers knew the territory and meticulously planned these horrendous murders."" During the investigation, Angela Wagner told local media that Hannah Rhoden ""was like a daughter"" to her and called the killers ""monsters"". Her husband, Billy Wagner, was also said to be close friends with victim Kenneth Rhoden. Pike County Sheriff Charles Reader, who was nearly brought to tears during the news conference, told reporters: ""Members of one family conspired, planned, carried out and then allegedly covered up their violent act to wipe out members of another family."" ""They did this quickly, coldly, calmly and very carefully - but not carefully enough. ""They left traces, they left a trail - the parts to build a silencer, the forged documents, the cameras, cell phones, all that they tampered with. And the lies, all the lies they told us."" There are 'multiple crime scenes' in Piketon, Ohio During the investigation, about 100 cannabis plants were found on the victims' property, and officials had initially speculated that the murders could be drug-related. Mr DeWine said the drugs were unrelated to the motive, but that the probe did include ""an undercurrent of drugs"".

Kuenssberg: What happened and what's next?Theresa May has made it this far - but surviving tonight does not mean surviving tomorrow.,"Regular readers know that I am sometimes, especially at an uncertain moment, fond of making a list. On Wednesday night, the prime minister has taken a big step forward on the path to taking the UK out of the EU without a giant political accident. It's not been a pretty process so far, and five hours of cabinet discussion was not easy either. But again, she made it this far. Surviving tonight, though, does not mean surviving Thursday. So what happened and what's next? The most important fact on Wednesday night - Theresa May has a draft divorce deal with the EU that sorts out how and when we leave, and gives the outline of what the relationship will be like for decades to come. Given how difficult it's been to get this far and how uncertain it's been that she would make it to this point, that is a big achievement. The cabinet backed her, but not exactly with glad hearts. Depending who you ask, either about 10 of its members objected properly to the deal, or about 10 of them expressed a few doubts but didn't have any alternatives to give. The truth is probably somewhere in between. A source in the room told me the sense was that most of them knew this was the only real choice, but none of them wanted it to be done in their name. Having talked to a few people who were present the sense was a reluctant inevitability. And backing from Michael Gove and Geoffrey Cox was key to making that that happen. The cabinet is still pretty divided on the substance of the deal. Although they are now bound by collective responsibility, that means in these trying days ahead, Theresa May can't rely on having colleagues on tap ready to fight for her deal on air, in the Commons tearooms and even in the division lobbies on the crucial night when the vote takes place. The threat of resignations is still live. Esther McVey, the work and pensions secretary, seems the most likely to go, followed by the International Development Secretary, Penny Mordaunt. And there is silence tonight and a lot of chatter about the position of the Brexit Secretary, Dominic Raab (update:Raab resigned on Thursday morning). One might not be a problem for the PM. The departure of either Mordaunt or Raab or both, both of whom harbour ambitions for the top job, would be very dangerous for Number 10. Just as immediately - Brexiteer backbenchers are furious, just like the DUP. And it is possible that the Parliamentary postman will be extremely busy tomorrow with letters that might trigger a challenge to Mrs May. One senior Tory told me on Wednesday night there was likely to be a move against the prime minister in the next 24 hours. Another said they would be amazed if enough objections to start a contest hadn't emerged by lunchtime on Thursday. NB - we have been here before. But soundings so far suggest the reaction among Eurosceptic MPs is more negative than they had expected.

Marie Antoinette pearl fetches record $36m,"The star of the auction was Marie Antoinette's Pearl, a natural pearl and diamond pendant A pearl and diamond pendant that belonged to ill-fated French Queen Marie Antoinette has been sold for $36m (Â£28m) in what Sotheby's auction house says is a world record for a pearl. The star lot at Sotheby's Geneva show was bought after a fierce bidding war. It had been valued at about $2m. It was part of amajor collection of jewellery sold by Italy's royal Bourbon-Parma house,external. Some of the jewels had not been seen in public for 200 years. The previous record for the most expensive pearl jewel was a necklace once owned by the late Dame Elizabeth Taylor. It was sold for $11.8m at Christie's auction house in 2011. Sotheby's called Wednesday's auction in Geneva ""one of the most important royal jewellery collections ever to appear on the market"". The French queen's jewels are part of a larger collection auctioned by Italy's Bourbon-Parma family Deputy Chair Daniela Mascetti said: ""This extraordinary group of jewels offers a captivating insight into the lives of its owners going back hundreds of years."" But she noted the ""inherent beauty of the pieces themselves; the precious gems they are adorned with and the exceptional craftsmanship they display are stunning in their own right"". Marie Antoinette's pendant sits here on a 119-natural-pearl necklace Other auctioned items include the natural pearl and diamond necklace, a pair of pearl and diamond earrings, and a monogram ring with a lock of her hair. One of the other items up for sale is a diamond ring bearing the initials MA for Marie Antoinette and containing a lock of her hair There were also pieces from King Charles X, the Archdukes of Austria and the Dukes of Parma, including a diamond tiara. The whole collection was sold for more than Â£53m. Marie Antoinette was an Austrian princess before her marriage to France's King Louis XVI. Her extravagant lifestyle turned her into a hate figure in the years leading up to the French Revolution, when many French people could barely afford to feed their families. She smuggled out her jewellery to her family in Austria before her failed attempt to flee France with Louis XVI and their children. She was guillotined in 1793 at the age of 37.

Child-tracking watches are 'easy to hack',"This video can not be played WATCH: How MiSafes watch can be hacked A location-tracking smartwatch worn by thousands of children has proven relatively easy to hack. A security researcher found the devices neither encrypted the data they used nor secured each child's account. As a result, he said, he could track children's movements, surreptitiously listen in to their activities and make spoof calls to the watches that appeared to be from parents. Experts say the issues are so severe that the product should be discarded. Both the BBC and the researcher involved tried to contact the makers of the MiSafes Kid's Watcher Plus to alert them to the problem but received no reply. Likewise, a China-based company listed as the product's supplier did not respond to requests. The MiSafes watch was first released in 2015. It uses a global positioning system (GPS) sensor and a 2G mobile data connection to let parents see where their child is, via a smartphone app. MiSafes targeted the watch at children as young as three In addition, parents can create a ""safe zone"" and receive an alert if the child leaves the area. The adult can also listen in to what their offspring is doing at any time and trigger two-way calls. Pen Test Partner's Ken Munro and Alan Monie learned of the product's existence when a friend bought one for his son earlier this year. Out of curiosity, they probed its security measures and found that easy-to-find PC software could be used to mimic the app's communications. This software could be used to change the assigned ID number, which was all it took to get access to others' accounts. This made it possible to see personal information used to register the product, including: a photo of the child their name, gender and date of birth their height and weight the parents' phone numbers the phone number assigned to the watch's Sim card ""It's probably the simplest hack we have ever seen,"" he told the BBC. ""I wish it was more complicated. It isn't."" Rather than compromise other people's watches,  the researchers bought several more units to test. The security researchers were able to fool the watch into showing a call was from a parent With these, they found it was possible to: trigger the remote listening facility of someone else's watch, with the only warning being that a brief ""busy"" message appeared before its screen returned to blank track the wearer's current and past locations alter the safe zone facility so that alerts were triggered by a child's approach rather than their departure Pen Test Partners also learned it was possible to bypass a feature supposed to limit the watch to accepting calls from only authorised parties. The researchers did this by using a online ""prank call"" service that fools receiving devices into showing another person's caller ID number. The watches allow parents to listen to their children ""any time"" as well as to make phone calls to the device ""Once a hacker has the parent's number, they could spoof a call to appear to come from it and the child would now think it's their mum or dad dialling,"" said Mr Munro. ""So they could leave a voice message or speak to the child to convince them to leave their house and go to a convenient location."" Using a different tool, Mr Munro said his team were able to see that about 14,000 MiSafes were still in active use. The Norwegian Consumer Council highlightedother cases of child-targeted smartwatches with security flaws last year. It said the MiSafes products appeared to be ""even more problematic"" than the examples it had flagged. ""This is another example of unsecure products that should never have reached the market,"" said Gro Mette Moen, the watchdog's acting director of digital services. ""Our advice is to refrain from buying these smartwatches until the sellers can prove that their features and security standards are satisfactory."" In the UK, Amazon used to sell the watches but has not had stock for some time. The BBC found three listings for the watches on eBay earlier this week but the online marketplace said it had since removed them on the grounds of an existing ban on equipment that could be used to spy on people's activities without their knowledge. ""We don't allow the sale of these products on our marketplace,"" said a spokeswoman. MiSafes previously made headlines in February when an Austrian cyber-security company discoveredseveral flaws with its Mi-Cam baby monitors,external. Security concerns were previously raised about the firm's baby-monitoring cameras SEC Consult said these meant hackers could spy on footage from owners' homes and hijack accounts. It too was unable to get a response from the manufacturer. How MiSafes watches can be hacked.

Stormy Daniels' lawyer 'arrested',"This video can not be played Michael Avenatti: 'I have never struck a woman' Michael Avenatti, lawyer for porn star Stormy Daniels in her suit against President Donald Trump, has been arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, police in Los Angeles say. Celebrity news website TMZ said this followed a physical confrontation between the lawyer and a woman. He denied the claim and was later released on $50,000 (Â£38,500) bail. The lawyer represents Ms Daniels, who alleges she and President Trump had a brief relationship - a claim he denies. Michael Avenatti rose to prominence as lawyer to porn actor and director Stormy Daniels Ms Daniels has sought to free herself from a non-disclosure agreement she signed before the 2016 election. The president and the porn star: Why this matters The conflicting statements in the Stormy Daniels saga NDAs: What are non-disclosure agreements? Mr Avenatti has called the allegations ""completely bogus"" and said he was confident he would be fully exonerated. Speaking to reporters after leaving a police station, he said: ""I have never struck a woman. I never will strike a woman. I have been an advocate for women's rights my entire career and I'm going to continue to be an advocate. ""I am not going to be intimidated from stopping what I am doing.""

Oxford Union criticised for Bannon invite,"Steve Bannon spoke at the European Broadcasting Union's News Xchange conference in Edinburgh The Oxford Union has been criticised for inviting Donald Trump's former adviser Steve Bannon to speak to its members. The former White House adviser's scheduled visit on Friday has been met with anger on social media, with protests planned by students. Oxford Students Stand Up To Racism said the union was ""giving credibility to racism and fascism"". The union president said it was a chance to ""critically question"" him. Mr Bannon was one of President Trump's closest aides until he quit the White House last year. He took part in the News Xchange conference in Edinburgh earlier, where a 56-year-old demonstrator was arrested and charged with threatening and abusive behaviour. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon pulled out of the conference over his ""far-right views"". About 100 protesters gathered outside the conference in Edinburgh On Facebook, the Oxford Students Stand Up To Racism group described Mr Bannon as ""the white supremacists' link to Donald Trump's White House"". ""The Oxford Union is once again giving a platform to a far right speaker, and by doing so legitimising racism,"" it said. The Hope Not Hate campaigntweeted,externalthat Mr Bannon was ""whipping up hate and division"". ""This might be a game to those running the Oxford Union, but this invite only serves to further Bannon's cause,"" it added. BBC chief defends Steve Bannon invitation Man arrested at Steve Bannon protest BBC boss hits back at Twitter critics Union president Stephen Horvath said it was an opportunity for members to ""hear from an individual who has been at the centre of the rise in right-wing populism, as well as to critically question and debate the ideas and rhetoric of Mr Bannon"". He added: ""It is only through listening to the opinions of others that we can fully understand those opinions. ""There is a profound intellectual value in critically thinking through why it is that we agree or disagree instead or just rejecting them out of hand.""

LiveReaction to May securing Cabinet backing1 minute ago1 minute ago Will the European Arrest Warrant system work as smoothly?Will the European Arrest Warrant system work as smoothly?2 minutes ago Police and security: What the draft deal saysPolice and security: What the draft deal says,"Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn have been on Sky News, with former Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab speaking to the BBC's Andrew Marr Mrs May warns party rivals that replacing her won't make Brexit negotiations easier or ""change the parliamentary arithmetic"" Labour leader Mr Corbyn says a further referendum is ""an option for the future but not an option for today"" Publication of the draft withdrawal agreement led to the resignations of two senior ministers and several junior ministers and aides Brian Wheeler and Tom Moseley From free trade agreement to no deal, find out what the key terms mean. What are the plans to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland after Brexit? Theresa May has agreed a draft Brexit deal with Brussels. What happens now? Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn have been out and about, setting out their stall on Brexit. We've also heard from the former Brexit secretary who resigned last week and Sir Graham Brady, the Tory MP who knows more than anyone how close the prime minister is to facing a no confidence vote. Here are some key lines:  Adam FlemingBrussels reporter The European Commission has
proposed 31 December, 2022 as the ultimate end date for a possible
extension to the post-Brexit transition or implementation period, according to
a diplomatic note of a meeting between Michel Barnier and EU27 ambassadors in
Brussels this afternoon. The EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier also said that the
UK is still pushing for a Chequers-style free trade area in goods with a common
rule-book to be included in the political declaration on the future
relationship. There was a divide between member
states that want an ambitious trading relationship with the UK and those who
want Britainâs access to the single market to be more constrained. The UK wants to maintain the
status quo on internal security, which is also âa problem,â ambassadors were
told. The final political declaration
could be between 14 and 20 pages long. Spain raised serious concerns
about Gibraltar, which officials fear could grow in the coming days. Michel Barnier said the political
situation in the UK was âvolatile.â A diplomat said the message from
the EUâs Brexit negotiators to the member states was âkeep a lid on your
concerns for now and weâll deal with them in the negotiations on the future
relationship."". The European Council is also
planning to issue conclusions which will go alongside the withdrawal agreement
and the political declaration when they are endorsed at the special summit next
week. New York Times The New York Times hastaken a quizzical look,externalat how Theresa May could be ousted as prime minister.  In a secret location, the chairman of a panel called the 1922 Committee was collecting poison-pen letters from rebels within Mrs Mayâs Conservative Party, calling for her to be removed as leader.  The number of letters is secret except to the chairman, Graham Brady, but once their number reaches 48, the committee â also known as âthe men in gray suitsâ â can demand a vote of all 315 Conservative members of Parliament. If she doesnât win half the votes, she will be forced to resign.  This is the way political death comes in Britain, speedily and stealthily.""  The Andrew Marr Show Nicola Sturgeon has confirmed her SNP MPs will vote against Theresa May's Brexit deal. The First Minister rejected claims her Westminster MPs could abstain on the vote in the House of Commons. The SNP leader told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show it would be ""deeply irresponsible"" for any MPs to endorse the prime minister's agreement, published last week. And she revealed she will be heading to London to talk to opposition parties about alternatives in the coming days. The SNP has 35 MPs at Westminster. Labour has said it will oppose the draft agreement in the crunch Commons vote, and the DUP - which props up the Tory government in key votes - has also criticised the proposals. Read more More from the DUP's Nigel Dodds, who has described the draft withdrawal deal as ""dangerous"". ""This deal would place a trade border in the Irish Sea, subject us to EU rules without any power to influence or change them and binds us to the EU with no unilateral ability to leave. Indeed, Northern Ireland is part of the EU customs union not the UK's."" Former first secretary of state Damian Green is an ally of Theresa May, so it's no surprise that he is strongly against any challenge to her leadership. If you step back, we are at the absolute crunch point of the most important negotiations this country has had for decades. I think saying that what the country now needs - let alone the Conservative Party, look at it on a national basis - to say that what the country now needs is a leadership election and a change of leadership, is absurd. From the country's point of view, I think that's exactly the wrong way to go.""  The Democratic Unionist Party, whose 10 MPs give Theresa May vital support in key votes, is not happy about the draft agreement, saying it could create a new border down the Irish Sea by making Northern Ireland follow different trade rules to the rest of the UK. Deputy leader Nigel Dodds said: ""I understand why some people fear a 'no deal' scenario. ""But the choice is between this very bad deal and the right
deal. ""With MPs on all sides of the House
pointing to the dangers for the Union of the Withdrawal
Agreement, it is clear that it is time to work for a better deal
which does not undermine the integrity of the United Kingdom.""  Catherine Haddon, of the Institute for Government think
tank, said the 25 November EU summit would probably have to be postponed if May loses a
vote of confidence. She would still be prime minister until a new Tory leader was elected, unless she resigned and handed over to a caretaker PM. âIt would have implications for the negotiations because we
donât know what the position of the new prime minister would be,â Ms Haddon told BBC
News. Appointing a caretaker PM would be âquite problematicâ because
the party is divided and would be unlikely to agree on a suitable candidate. The whole Tory leadership process takes about two months,
although they could shorten it, but they would âhave to say to the EU, and the
public, we will come back in January and try to get through the leadership
contest between now and thenâ. That would take us even closer to the 29 March, the
scheduled departure date, and make it even tighter to get the required Brexit
legislation through Parliament in time. Tory MPs will be conscious of the time pressure and if she
survives this week then the chances of her being ousted are reduced, argued Ms
Haddon. She could face another âpressure pointâ when MPs vote on the
deal, which might lead to another attempt to get her out. If she won a  vote of confidence it would âstrengthen
her hand quite considerably,â she adds. The BBC's Europe editor tweets...  Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Sky News Liberal Democrats leader Vince Cable says former Prime Minister David Cameron ""opened a can of worms"" that can't easily be closed when he called the referendum in 2016. Sir Cable said the whole issue of Europe was divisive and the ""least damaging"" way forward now would be to go back to the people, put the question before them and come to a ""clear decision"". The case would be made on facts rather than promises, as it was a few years ago, he said. Asked if he thought Mrs May would keep her job, Sir Vince said: ""I think so."" He said she had shown courage and character but that does not avoid the fact she made a terrible decision to set a series of red lines that could not be met.  Allow Twitter content?

Rob WatsonBBC political correspondent This time next week Theresa May hopes to be in Brussels finalising her Brexit plan with EU leaders. In the meantime she's fighting off challenges at home not just to that plan but her very leadership. Her message to hardline Brexiteers within the Conservative Party - getting rid of me won't make Brexit any easier. So far those Brexiteers have yet to muster the numbers against her for a vote of no confidence, though that could come any minute or any day. Whatever happens, whether she survives any leadership challenge or not,  the Conservative party now seems in a state of open civil war over Brexit with unforeseeable consequences for Britain's departure from the EU. The World This WeekendRadio 4 programme John Whittingdale, a former culture secretary, is one of the Conservative MPs who have submitted a letter calling for the prime minister to stand down. ""When you have a succession of resignations of the numbers that we have seen, not just this week, but when the Chequers Agreement was published, it does look like a government in disarray and it's very hard to reach any other conclusion. ""But that is because we are pushing ahead with a deal that commands very little support in the Conservative Party, is opposed in Parliament and certainly on the basis of my discussions with my own constituents, commands virtually no support in the country."" The World This WeekendRadio 4 programme Another Conservative association chair, councillor Tom Ashton of the Boston and Skegness association where people voted overwhelmingly for Brexit, says Mrs May should stay - for now. ""I wouldn't support a leadership challenge at this stage,"" he said. ""I feel she deserves the chance now to bring the deal that she's speaking of before Parliament. ""But if you cannot get a deal through, then I think it'll be up to party colleagues in Parliament 
to consider their options,"" he added. The BBC's Andrew Marr clashes with Baroness Chakrabarti, Labour's shadow attorney general, during a discussion about Brexit. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
"California fire town needs 'total rebuild'More than 103 people are still missing in Butte County, as the National Guard join the search.","Senior officials have been touring the fire-ravaged northern Californian town of Paradise The director of the US emergency agency says a California town ravaged by wildfire will need a ""total rebuild"" job that will take several years. Brock Long, administrator of Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), said the damage to Paradise was ""one of the worst disasters"" he had ever seen. So far 56 people have been found dead in the Camp Fire that hit the town, but 130 more remain missing. About 9,400 firefighters are currently battling wildfires across the state. At a news briefing on Thursday, the director of California's fire service said ""firefighters are making good progress"" to contain the blazes, even as new fires continue to pop up. ""We continue to engage in the fire fight. We continue to keep our eye on the ball,"" Chief Ken Pimlott said. He added that over 242,000 acres have burned across the state so far and nearly 11,000 buildings have been destroyed. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

On Wednesday, rescuers found the remains of eight more victims  - all in and around Paradise. Crews have contained 35% of the Camp Fire in northern California, which has become the deadliest conflagration in state history. Before and after snapshots Is it advisable to escape a wildfire by car? Red carpets cancelled after wildfires They do not expect to fully contain the blaze - which has razed 145,000 acres (56,600 ha) - until the end of the month. Cadaver dogs and forensic experts are scouring the town Butte County officials have released a list of 103 people they believe are still missing,external- most of whom are elderly. So far 7,600 residences are known to have been destroyed by the fire, as well as hundreds of commercial properties. Governor Brown, who was touring the area on Wednesday, described it as looking like a ""war zone"". ""Paradise had done a lot of pre-planning for just this kind of an emergency but the fire of course was unprecedented, overwhelming and so a lot of people got caught,"" he said. This video can not be played California wildfires survivor's tearful account of escape with son Military troops are assisting forensics teams and cadaver dogs as they continue to search for human remains. Watch: Long battle against California wildfires Watch: Why California wildfires are so deadly Officials have warned the search operation could take weeks. A number of fires continue to burn and officials at Thursday's press conference warned the risk of more is far from over. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke, who has been touring the damage called it ""unsustainable"" for such fires to become a yearly occurrence. ""We're a great nation, this not a Republican Democrat issue, this is an American and we should address it as such."" This video can not be played With wildfires occurring across the globe, here are some of the techniques used to stop them Governor Jerry Brown said the solution will involve addressing climate change. ""We have to get on the side of nature, not just fight it,"" said the Democratic governor. Meanwhile, officials said ""good progress"" was being made on the Woolsey Fire that has damaged beach resorts, including the rich-and-famous haunt of Malibu. 'Three minutes separated me from death' Animals caught in wildfire destruction The photos not from the California fires Officials confirmed on Wednesday morning that a third victim from that fire had been discovered - meaning 59 people are now known to have died across the state. Actor Gerard Butler and singer Miley Cyrus are among the celebrities known to have suffered damage The Woolsey Fire is still burning across more than 98,000 acres but is 57% contained, the state fire service tweeted. Some areas affected are now considered safe, and the Los Angeles County police say they will now allow some people back into the city of Calabasas. The smaller Hill Fire, is 94% contained in Ventura County, north of Los Angeles. Police have lifted evacuation orders for residents of Lake Sherwood and Hidden Valley. A new wind-driven fire began menacing San Bernardino County homes on Tuesday - but that has been being largely contained by local officials. Officials have not yet confirmed what started any of the blazes. Several people have already filed a lawsuit against Pacific Gas & Electric, causing their stock price to plunge by over 31% which amounts to market value of about $16bn. On Monday, the California Public Utilities Commissions (CPUC) announced investigations into PG&E and another electric company, Southern California Edison (SCE). SCE had reported issues with transmission lines near the start of the Hill and Woolsey Fires in southern California. Historically, California's ""wildfire season"" started in summer and ran into early autumn but experts have warned that the risk is now year-round. Low humidity, warm Santa Ana winds, and dry ground after a rain-free month have produced a prime fire-spreading environment. Speaking on Wednesday, Governor Brown said a range of factors were behind worsening fires in the state. ""It's not one thing, its people, it's how people live, its where they live, and it's the changing climate, the drought, the diminishing moisture and the truth is â¦ we're going to have more difficulties,"" he said.
