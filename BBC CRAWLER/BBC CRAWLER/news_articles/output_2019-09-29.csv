Government plans billions for hospital projects,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: This is the moment to invest in our NHS for the long term The government has pledged billions for hospital projects across England, at the start of the Conservative party conference. The plans include a Â£2.7bn investment for six hospitals over five years. A new approach to NHS mental health treatment will also be trialled in 12 areas of England - with housing and job support alongside psychological help. NHS Providers welcomed the funding but said more was needed to make up for ""a decade of capital squeeze"". The organisation, which represents trusts in England, said the NHS's annual capital spending of around Â£6bn needed to double over the next five to 10 years to meet its needs. The government says Â£70m is also being invested in the mental health pilot areas, with the NHS building more ties with charities and local councils. About 1,000 extra specialist staff will be recruited in 12 pilot sites, with expertise in a range of mental health issues, the government says. Under plans drawn up by Health Secretary Matt Hancock, the government has said Â£13bn will be spent on hospital projects, including entirely new buildings or revamping existing structures to improve facilities. The same pot of money will also be used to develop plans for further projects in the future. Mr Hancock said the funding would come from taxpayers, rather than PFI contracts whereby private firms fund the cost of building facilities and, in return, the state makes payments over a stipulated period of time for their use and management. The six hospital trusts to benefit from the Â£2.7bn in funding are: Whipps Cross Hospital, in Leytonstone, east London Epsom and St Helier Trust West Hertfordshire Trust Princess Alexandra Hospital Trust University Hospitals of Leicester Trust Leeds Teaching Hospitals Trust. Mr Hancock told Sky News's Sophy Ridge on Sunday programme that funding for these six trusts was in place so building work could begin ""straight away"". A further 34 hospitals will receive Â£100m in initial funding to start developing projects, including Addenbrookes Hospital in Cambridge, the Queen's Medical Centre in Nottingham and the North Manchester General Hospital. The remaining projects, including up to a dozen smaller community hospitals in Dorset, would be completed over the second half of the next decade. The plans also include Â£200m for replacing MRI, CT scanners and breast cancer screening equipment. The government has certainly tried to grab the headlines with its claim that 40 new hospitals are to be built in England. But the announcement is very scant on detail. While we know which places these new hospitals will be built in, we don't know the scale of the plans. For example, when the government announced 20 projects in the summer it turned out that some amounted to little more than re-development of wards and clinics in the community. The green light has been given to six schemes - and with Â£2.7bn of funding attached we can assume they will be pretty substantial. But it's far from certain that will be the case for the other 34. The government has basically given health bosses the go-ahead to draw up plans, not to actually build them. The money being talked about to pay for them in the long-term suggests some may be on a smaller-scale. The final - and perhaps most important - element to be decided is just how much the budget for buildings is to be increased by in the coming years to pay for all this. Around Â£7bn is being spent this year, but there is already a huge backlog of repairs and maintenance that needs to be done. If ministers are serious about these new buildings and tackling that, the budget will have to increase substantially. NHS Providers chief executive Chris Hopson said the commitments were ""significant"" and ""particularly good news"" for the six hospitals that would directly benefit. However, he said funding to complete schemes in 34 other hospitals had not yet been allocated. ""It's not just these six hospitals who have crumbling, outdated, infrastructure - community and mental health trusts, ambulance services and other hospitals across the country have equally pressing needs,"" he added. Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said the government's announcement that it was building 40 new hospitals had ""quickly unravelled as spin"". ""This isn't 40 new hospitals, it is just reconfiguring six,"" he said. ""New investment is desperately needed and of course we welcome any genuine new money, but patients and demoralised NHS staff are fed up of being taken for fools like this."" Brexit promises as Tory conference begins NHS plan: What it means for you Is NHS buildings boost all it seems? PM 'glad' about father's hospital confrontation The government said there would be an extra Â£2.3bn a year by 2023-4 to improve mental health care and Â£975m of funding was earmarked to provide community mental health provision. The 2.3bn figure was announced when the government outlined its future priorities for the NHS in January under theNHS Long Term Plan,external. The 12 pilot areas will be funded from this pot. Mental health minister Nadine Dorries said the plans for a new approach to mental health treatment and Â£70m of investment in pilot areas would begin a ""step-change"" in provision. This video can not be played Boris Johnson confronted during London hospital visit The pilot areas will cover services in the Humber, Coast and Vale Health and Care Partnership, Frimley Health and Care, and Surrey Heartlands; providers for Cambridge and Peterborough; Hertfordshire and West Essex; north-west London; north-east London; Herefordshire and Worcestershire; Lincolnshire; South Yorkshire and Bassetlaw; Cheshire and Merseyside, and Somerset. Ministers say the plans will involve a range of mental health issues, including eating disorders and alcohol addiction, psychosis and bipolar disorder. Speaking ahead of the start of the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester, Ms Dorries added: ""We know there are many causes behind mental illness - including significant life changes, problems at work or addiction - so it is only right that the NHS brings services together to serve patients in their communities."" Meanwhile, the prime minister has unveiled a Â£200m cash injection for the UK's health and life sciences industry. The funding will be matched by Â£400m of private investment to allow science companies to expand development plans. This government hopes the investment will allow companies to raise capital to run clinical trials, employ more industrial scientists and boost manufacturing in the UK. Boris Johnson said it was part of his vision to have a ""vibrant post-Brexit economy fuelled by science and technology"". He said: ""The UK has the best universities in the world and we have a proud history of scientific discovery from penicillin to sequencing the human genome. But too often we let another country commercialise this discovery. ""I want the lifesaving cancer treatments of tomorrow to say 'discovered and made in Britain'. That means allowing enough late stage capital to be mobilised so that these science discoveries do not have to go overseas to be commercialised.""

Thomas Cook boss 'deeply sorry' but defends pay,"The boss of collapsed Thomas Cook has said he is ""deeply sorry"" over the historic travel firm's liquidation. Peter Fankhauser alsotold the Mail on Sunday,externalthat saying farewell to staff had been ""heartbreaking"". The 178-year-old travel firm collapsed this week, putting 9,000 staff in the UK out of work - and leaving 150,000 British holidaymakers stuck overseas. But Mr Fankhauser defended the Â£8.3m he has been paid since November 2014, and denied he was a ""fat cat"". The 58-year-old said around half his remuneration, some Â£4m, came in the form of share payments, which were now worthless as he did not cash them in before Thomas Cook went into liquidation on 23 September. ""I don't think that I am the 'fat cat' that I am being described as,"" he told the newspaper. Around 55,000 holidaymakers still need to be returned to the UK It comes as the UK's Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) gave an update on its efforts to repatriate stranded UK holidaymakers. The CAA said on Saturday it had operated 69 flights, covering 40 airports at home and abroad, as Operation Matterhorn completed its sixth day. Operation Matterhorn which runs until 6 October, has returned around 93,000 people so far and plans to run another 70 flights on Sunday. The size of Mr Fankhauser's pay and bonuses has attracted criticism from Thomas Cook staff, unions, and politicians. Business secretary Andrea Leadsom has asked the official receiver, which oversees liquidations, to look at whether bosses' actions ""caused detriment to creditors or to the pension schemes"". Thomas Cook staff begin legal action over job cuts Thomas Cook executive sorry over bailout video Thomas Cook bosses face scrutiny over collapse Thomas Cook collapse: What are your rights? Top directors at the holiday company have been paid a combined Â£20m in salaries and bonuses since 2014. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has also questioned whether directors should pay themselves ""large sums of money"" as their businesses go ""down the tubes"". Meanwhile, Rachel Reeves, chair of the Business, Energy and Industrialâ¯Strategy Committee, said that the public was ""appalled that as Thomas Cook mounted up debt and as the company headed for trouble, company bosses were happily pocketing hefty pay-packages"". She also said there were questions to be asked about Thomas Cook's ""accounting practices"", with suggestions that they improved the chances of executives being paid large bonuses. But Mr Fankhauser said: ""That is just rubbish. I shouldn't say that. But it is just not right."" He defended his pay saying it was not ""outrageous"" compared with other bosses in the FTSE 250 index, which Thomas Cook exited last December. He also said pay-packages had been set by the firm's remuneration committee and approved by shareholders. Meanwhile, in a separateinterview with The Sunday Times,external, Mr Fankhauser, a Swiss national, appeared to blame a group of banks for not supporting a bail-out plan for Thomas Cook. He said if bondholders and a syndicate of 17 banks - including Barclays, Morgan Stanley, DNB, UniCredit, Credit Suisse, Lloyds and Royal Bank of Scotland - had acted faster, then Thomas Cook would still be trading. ""The longer the talks dragged on, the more uncertainty grew, increasing the likelihood of a liquidity squeeze,"" Mr Fankhauser told the newspaper. ""Had we been quicker, we might not be in the situation we are now."" Thomas Cook had secured a Â£900m rescue deal led by its largest shareholder Chinese firm Fosun in August, but a recent demand from its banks to raise a further Â£200m in contingency funding put the deal in doubt. Mr Fankhauser accused the banks and bondholders of ""trading for every point"" during what were to be ultimately-unsuccessful funding talks. He also told the paper: ""I think it would be very difficult for me to find another job in the UK.""

Asher-Smith wins world 100m silver,"This video can not be played Watch: Asher-Smith claims historic silver as Fraser-Pryce wins 100m 2019 World Athletics Championships Venue:Khalifa International Stadium, DohaDates:27 September-6 October Coverage:Watch live on BBC TV, BBC iPlayer and BBC Sport website and app; Listen live on BBC Radio 5 Live; Live streams, clips and text commentary online. Dina Asher-Smith became the first British woman to win an individual World Championships sprint medal in 36 years as she claimed silver in the 100m final with Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce taking gold. It is the 23-year-old's first 100m global medal outdoors with the 200m to follow, where she is a strong contender for gold. Jamaica's Fraser-Pryce, 32, powered to 10.71 seconds in Doha for her eighth world title while Asher-Smith's 10.83 is a new British record. ""I have worked so hard for these championships and hopefully I'll go on to do even bigger things,"" Asher-Smith told BBC Sport. ""I'm really pleased to come away with a personal best and national record. That is more than you could ever ask for in a world final. ""I was thinking on the line: this is your time to go."" Ivory Coast's Marie-Josee Ta Lou took bronze in 10.90. Asher-Smith silver 'bodes so well for 2020' - pundits' reaction Day-to-day guide to the Championships How to follow live on BBC TV, radio and online British athletics has waited a long time for someone to emulate the achievement of Kathy Cook, who won 200m bronze in the inaugural World Athletics Championships, back in 1983 in Helsinki. Few showed the potential to do so in the intervening years before Asher-Smith's emergence. The Kent-born athlete was a double European junior gold medallist in 2013, before taking the world junior 100m title the following year. She grew in stature when she became the first British women to dip under 11 seconds in 2015 before winning the European 100m title in 2016. Relay medals followed at world and Olympic level before she won three European golds last year. Expectations grew of what she could now achieve at world and Olympic level, but prior to this competition Asher-Smith told BBC Sport that she avoided making any predictions public - stating that her aims were only shared by those close to her, including her long-time coach John Blackie. Her tunnel vision and mental fortitude took her to a different level this season, and she has now been rewarded with world 100m silver. Asher-Smith is now aiming to win a further two medals - in the 200m and 4x100m relay. ""I think we've all got to dare to dream, simply because it's the championships,"" Asher-Smith said of her 200m hopes, with the heats beginning on Monday from 15:05 BST. ""I'm going to go to bed, hopefully get some sleep and turn up in the right state of mind for tomorrow."" Fraser Pryce, who carried son Zyon on her lap of honour, told BBC Sport: ""To be standing here as world champion again after having my baby, I am elated. ""Having my son and coming back, performing the way I did, I hope I can give inspiration to all the women starting a family or thinking of starting a family. You can do anything."" This video can not be played World Athletics Championships: Dina Asher-Smith is 'super happy' and daring to dream In the end it was a straight duel between Fraser-Pryce and Asher-Smith, who had defeated the Jamaican in the Brussels Diamond League final earlier in September. The Briton came to Doha having recorded times under 11 seconds in every 100m race she had run this season - six in total - bar the heats of the British Championships. She maintained that consistency here, clocking 10.96 in Saturday's heats and then 10.87 in her semi-final two hours before Sunday's final. But Fraser-Pryce looked that little bit sharper. The 32-year-old, whose first major global gold was the Beijing 2008 Olympic 100m title, set the fastest time in a World Championships heat with 10.80 before cruising to 10.81 in her semi-final. In the final, Asher-Smith gave all she could but it was not enough to overhaul one of world sprinting's all-time greats. However, the fillip for Asher-Smith is that Fraser-Pryce is not on the startlist for the 200m while Bahamian Shaunae Miller-Uibo, who easily beat the Briton in the Birmingham Diamond League, will only race in the 400m because of the schedule. The Briton is ranked first in the event this season, although both Nigeria's Blessing Okagbare and Jamaica's Olympic champion Elaine Thompson have run faster times. Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce on motherhood, hair and medals This video can not be played 'Absolutely shocking' - Denise Lewis on empty stands in Doha By the time the 100m final took place at 23:20 local time, the stadium was virtually deserted and Fraser-Pryce, Asher-Smith and Ta Lou had few people for company as they completed their lap of honour. The poor attendances over the first three days in Doha have been a major talking point and BBC Sport pundit Denise Lewis said on Sunday that athletics' governing body the IAAF ""has let our athletes down massively"". She added: ""I walked into the stadium tonight, looked around and said, 'is this the World Championships?' We've waited until October to have stands like this. Empty. Absolutely shocking. I think the athletes, they work so hard, they try to peak at the right time for an empty stadium. I just think it's not right. ""I didn't expect it to be this bad. We want to see people. The athletes deserve people, an energy and an atmosphere to thrive on."" The IAAF told BBC Sport that Friday's day-one attendance at the 40,000-capacity Khalifa International Stadium was 11,800 ticket-holders with up to 2,000 guests, while Saturday's crowd was 11,300 plus guests. Sunday's figures were not yet available. Doha World Championships a 'disaster' - Mayer Holly Bradshaw has jumped 4.87m indoors In the women's pole vault final, European bronze medallist Holly Bradshaw narrowly missed out on a first global outdoor medal, finishing fourth with a best clearance of 4.80m - just 1cm below her British record. She twice failed at 4.85m, and then with a last-ditch attempt at 4.90m. ""I honestly couldn't have given any more. I was gutted that I couldn't get 4.85m because I feel it's within me, but I'm really happy/slash torn. I can't complain, though,"" Bradshaw, 27, told BBC Sport. The gold was won by Russian Anzhelika Sidorova, under the Authorised Neutral Athlete flag, with 4.95m. USA's Sandi Morris took silver and 2017 champion Katerina Stefanidi claimed bronze. Meanwhile, American athletics great Allyson Felix secured her 12th world title as her quartet won the first 4x400m mixed relay final at a World Championships. The 33-year-old, who only returned to competitive racing earlier in September 10 months after giving birth to her first child by emergency caesarean, ran the second leg as USA won in a world record time of three minutes 09.34 seconds. Jamaica claimed silver and Bahrain took bronze. Great Britain's team of Rabah Yousif, Zoey Clark, Emily Diamond and Martyn Rooney finished fourth. This video can not be played World Athletics Championships: USA take gold ahead of Jamaica In the men's 200m, Britain's sprinters Adam Gemili, Miguel Francis and Zharnel Hughes all advanced from their heats to qualify for Monday's semi-finals. American Christian Coleman, the 100m champion, withdrew shortly before the heats because he said he was ""feeling the strain"". Gemili, 25, won his heat in 20.06 - his fastest time for three years and his fourth quickest ever - and said the display was ""a bit of redemption"" for narrowly failing to reach the 100m final. ""To mentally park [yesterday] for the moment was difficult, but I've been working a lot on my psychology,"" said Gemili, who was edged out in a photo-finish on Saturday. ""I wanted to get a good semi-final so hopefully this has guaranteed that. A bit of redemption for yesterday because I feel like a let a lot of people down, which was disappointing for me."" Francis, the fastest Briton this year having run 19.97 in London, and Hughes, fresh from coming sixth in the 100m final, both eased through. European 100m champion Hughes, who ran a modest 20.24 in finishing second, said: ""Last night I didn't get any sleep as I was held up by anti-doping so I fell asleep about 4am this morning and then I had to be up for 8am. I know once I get back to warm-up, get an ice bath, I'll be OK."" The event's outstanding favourite Noah Lyles of the USA, whose 19.50 seconds in Lausanne this year is the fourth fastest ever, was in third gear as he came second in his heat in 20.26. There will be no British representation in the 800m final with Elliott Giles, Jamie Webb and Kyle Langford all falling short in the semi-finals. Elsewhere, USA's Christian Taylor won an incredible fourth triple jump title with a fifth-round effort of 17.92m. Compatriot Will Claye was second with 17.74m and there was a first major medal for Burkina Faso's Hugues Fabrice Zango, who clinched bronze with 17.66m - an African record. China's Liu Hong, who returned from maternity leave in 2018, won her third world women's 20km walk title in one hour 32 minutes 53 seconds. Compatriots Qieyang Shenjie (1:33:10) and Yang Liujing (1:33:17) claimed silver and bronze respectively.

Boris Johnson denies wrongdoing over Arcuri link,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: 'Everything has been done with full propriety' Boris Johnson says there was ""no interest to declare"" regarding links with US businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri. It is alleged Ms Arcuri received favourable treatment due to her friendship with Mr Johnson. The police watchdog are deciding whether to investigate the prime minister for a potential criminal offence of misconduct in public office while he was London mayor. Mr Johnson said everything had been done ""with full propriety"". The allegations,first reported in the Sunday Times,external, claim Ms Arcuri joined trade missions led by Mr Johnson when he was mayor of London and that her company received several thousand pounds in sponsorship grants. The paper has also reported Ms Arcuri told four friends that she had an affair with Mr Johnson while he was mayor of London. On Friday, the Greater London Authority's monitoring officer referred the prime minister to the Independent Office of Police Conduct (IOPC) - whose job it is to oversee the conduct of the mayor and other members of the GLA. PM defends actions over conflict of interest claims PM will explain Jennifer Arcuri links to City Hall PM's referral to watchdog 'politically motivated' Asked on the Andrew Marr show if he had declared any interest, Mr Johnson said ""there was no interest to declare"". ""I was proud of everything I did as mayor of London,"" he added. He also attacked Sadiq Khan, the current mayor of London, saying the Labour politician ""could possibly spend more time investing in police officers than he is investing in press officers and peddling this kind of stuff"". Mr Johnson added that someone in his position ""expects a lot of shot and shell"". The woman at the centre of this story is Jennifer Arcuri, who describes herself on Twitter as an entrepreneur, cyber security expert and producer. She began her career as a DJ on Radio Disney, before moving into film - where she wrote, produced and directed a short film that went on to be sold at Cannes Film Festival. Ms Arcuri then brought in her tech skills to create a streaming platform for independent film makers. But it was her founding of The Innotech Network in London that saw her path cross with Boris Johnson. The network hosts events to discuss tech policy, and Mr Johnson was the keynote speaker at the first of those in 2012. Since then, Ms Arcuri has also founded another company called Hacker House, which uses ethical hackers to find tech solutions for businesses. Speaking on Sky News, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the prime minister did not have questions to answer regarding alleged links with the US businesswoman. ""Any monies involved went through proper due process - this was a long time ago. ""Of course, in politics, there is always squalls and there are always debates about individuals."" But Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the GLA's monitoring officer had made a ""wholly independent assessment"" and decided there were ""serious questions to answer"". In a letter to Mr Johnson, the monitoring officer set out their reasons for referring the matter to the police watchdog. ""During this time [2008 - 2016] it has been brought to my attention that you maintained a friendship with Ms Jennifer Arcuri and as a result of that friendship allowed Ms Arcuri to participate in trade missions and receive sponsorship monies in circumstances when she and her companies could not have expected otherwise to receive those benefits,"" it said. The monitoring officer said it had referred the PM to the IOPC ""so it can assess whether or not it is necessary to investigate the former mayor of London for the criminal offence of misconduct in public office"". It said it had recorded a ""conduct matter"" against Mr Johnson, which happens when there is information that indicates a criminal offence may have been committed. But it does not mean that a criminal offence is proved in any way, the monitoring officer added.

"Protest at church over Wrightbus donationsHundreds of people gathered outside Green Pastures Church, which received Â£15m from the collapsed firm.","Some workers have expressed concern that donations to the church weakened the business Hundreds of people have taken part in a protest outside a Ballymena church which received millions of pounds in donations from Wrightbus. One of the pastors at Green Pastures Church is Jeff Wright, who also controlled the Wright group. It received more than Â£15m from the firm in recent years, most of which was donated while the group was profitable. About 1,200 people lost their jobswhen Wrightbus was placed into administration. Questions over Green Pastures donations From driving seat to financial failure Family deny blocking Wrightbus factory deal The protesters began arriving outside the church at 09:00 BST, and an estimated 500 people had gathered within two hours, many carrying placards. There were some police officers both inside and outside the church, but the protests were peaceful. The protesters may have gone but they left their work shirts attached to the fence Wrightbus founder, Sir William Wright, stopped to speak to some of the protesters on his way into the church and was applauded by many of them. Stephen McMaster said he had clapped because ""nobody in the whole of Ballymena or this workforce runs down William Wright for this chaos"". Another protester said he was there because the workers had ""nowhere to go, nobody to see"" and they wanted answers. Fiona Knowles, niece of Jeff Wright, said she hoped a buyer could be found Fiona Knowles, Sir William's granddaughter, joined protesters outside the church. She said she had lost her job at the company more than a year ago and it broke her heart. ""I have lost everything in my life,"" she said. ""I am having to rebuild my life again so I know how these guys feel. ""I just hope we can find a buyer because it is a good company with a good product and these guys deserve better."" Later, inside the church, Jeff Wright received a standing ovation during his sermon. Mr Wright was tearful as he defended his recent public silence. On Sunday night, the church posted online what he had said. ""My heart for the company and its people means more to me than the vicious comments and the intimidation that my family have received in the last week,"" he said. ""But I have learned from dad that there's a time to speak and a time to be silent."" He said talks to try to save the workforce were ongoing and he did not want to say anything that would jeopardise the negotiations. During the service, anyone affected by the collapse was asked to stand while the rest of the congregation prayed for them. Mr Wright said he was working hard to ensure there was future employment for the workers. Wrightbus's majority shareholder is Jeff Wright, who leads Green Pastures, a religious charity The Green Pastures charity received Â£15m in donations from Wrightbus over six years, and some workers have expressed concern the donations weakened the business. The Wright family, who founded Wrightbus in 1946, say the collapse of the business was due to a big fall in demand for buses in the UK market. The group, which had been suffering from financial problems and was up for sale, went into administration on Wednesday.

Quarriers 'brothers and sisters' remembered,"Former children's home residents and abuse survivors have gathered at the end of a campaign to reinstate headstones for hundreds of children who lay in unmarked graves. A white rose was laid in remembrance for each of the 335 children buried in Quarriers village in Renfrewshire. They were laid to rest in the village's Nittinghill Graveyard from 1888 until 1971 but their gravestones were removed in the 1960s. Former resident Sandy Smith has led a two-year campaign to reinstate the headstones. The campaign began when it emerged that 80 headstones marking the graves of children who died while they lived at Quarriers children's home near Bridge of Weir had inexplicably disappeared. A plaque was unveiled in memory of their ""brothers and sisters"" who lie buried in the cemetery Mr Smith believes those children would still be lying in unmarked graves today if he hadn't returned six years ago to the place where he spent his childhood. Quarriers is one of several organisationsinvestigated in the Scottish Child Abuse Inquiryabout abuse inflicted upon some children in its care. A resident of Quarriers from the age of five, and a victim of abuse, Mr Smith struggled with his childhood experiences. After an attempt to take his own life and the breakdown of his marriage, he reconnected with his past - and other children from Quarriers - through an online forum in 2013. He found a friend he first met in at the children's home in 1956. He had not seen her since she was removed from the home a few years later. Sandy Smith and Jayne Savery when they were residents at Quarrier's as children After meeting up with Jayne Savery, they became a couple and revisited the site of the home in 2013 in a bid to relive some happy memories. They were shocked to find that when they entered the cemetery, the graves they remembered were gone. Ms Savery said: ""Only a Quarriers child would have noticed that they were removed. As a little girl I used to play hopscotch using the gravestones as stepping stones as at that time they were flat on the ground."" Mr Smith was angry and upset. He said: ""Over time, it preyed on my mind and eventually in 2017, I called Quarriers. ""I asked why they had been removed but no one could answer that. They promised the stones would be replaced by March or April 2018."" In January 2018,the Quarriers charity apologised ""for any distress caused"" over the removal of headstonesfrom Nittingshill cemetery and said it had plans to have them reinstated. However, this took some time, with rows of stones gradually reinstated over the course of nearly two years. Quarrier's village with Mount Zion church at the centre The last headstone was placed at the cemetery in August. On Thursday, the stones were dedicated in a ceremony organised by Quarriers. A total of 155 grave markers now show all the names of children buried there. Mr Smith's support group, Quarriers Warriors, organised a memorial service on Sunday to mark the return of the headstones. He said: ""Now these children can be remembered once more. They will be rejoicing in heaven knowing we did not forget them and they will always be remembered."" Alice Harper, chief executive of Quarriers said: ""It was extremely important to Quarrier's to put grave markers in place. ""Having been approached by a group representing former residents requesting our support, we made an early commitment to putting grave markers in place as we agreed it was the right thing to do. ""Until now, children had been remembered and recognised with a plaque stating their name, age and year of death."" Sandy Smith has led a two-year campaign to reinstate the gravestones The stories of the first three children laid to rest at Quarrier's Nittingshill cemetery were shared at the dedication service on Thursday. Ten years after the village was established, William Sinclair, William Kean, and Sarah McLeod were buried there. Orphaned at the age of three, William Sinclair went to Quarrier's in December 1887 but died just four months later. William Kean, the eldest of four children, arrived aged nine in April 1887. Their father, a brewery carter, expressed a strong desire for the children to be placed at Quarrier's. William died in May 1888 after a short illness. His siblings were migrated to Canada. Sarah McLeod was the middle child of John, a baker from Skye and Mary from Dingwall. Sarah came to Quarrier's in 1887 along with sister Bella, 10, and brother Archie, 5. Sarah died of heart disease in May 1888. Bella returned to her mother and Archie was migrated to Canada. The central building at Quarrier's village in the 1920s Quarriers Village was established in 1878 by philanthropist William Quarrier, a successful merchant who had started his working life at the age of seven as a pin maker. His charity was known as Orphan Homes of Scotland and was changed to Quarriers Homes in 1958. By the 1890s his ""children's village"" included 34 ""cottages"" a school and even a fire station -  based around Mount Zion Church and Nittingshill Cemetery. Children who were cared for by Quarriers could be buried at the cemetery, alongside William Quarrier, his family and local residents. From 1888 until 1971, 335 children were buried in Nittingshill Graveyard. Mount Zion Church is now a residential property. The Quarriers charity continues the work of the former homes and is based within the village.

Protest at church over Wrightbus donations,"Some workers have expressed concern that donations to the church weakened the business Hundreds of people have taken part in a protest outside a Ballymena church which received millions of pounds in donations from Wrightbus. One of the pastors at Green Pastures Church is Jeff Wright, who also controlled the Wright group. It received more than Â£15m from the firm in recent years, most of which was donated while the group was profitable. About 1,200 people lost their jobswhen Wrightbus was placed into administration. Questions over Green Pastures donations From driving seat to financial failure Family deny blocking Wrightbus factory deal The protesters began arriving outside the church at 09:00 BST, and an estimated 500 people had gathered within two hours, many carrying placards. There were some police officers both inside and outside the church, but the protests were peaceful. The protesters may have gone but they left their work shirts attached to the fence Wrightbus founder, Sir William Wright, stopped to speak to some of the protesters on his way into the church and was applauded by many of them. Stephen McMaster said he had clapped because ""nobody in the whole of Ballymena or this workforce runs down William Wright for this chaos"". Another protester said he was there because the workers had ""nowhere to go, nobody to see"" and they wanted answers. Fiona Knowles, niece of Jeff Wright, said she hoped a buyer could be found Fiona Knowles, Sir William's granddaughter, joined protesters outside the church. She said she had lost her job at the company more than a year ago and it broke her heart. ""I have lost everything in my life,"" she said. ""I am having to rebuild my life again so I know how these guys feel. ""I just hope we can find a buyer because it is a good company with a good product and these guys deserve better."" Later, inside the church, Jeff Wright received a standing ovation during his sermon. Mr Wright was tearful as he defended his recent public silence. On Sunday night, the church posted online what he had said. ""My heart for the company and its people means more to me than the vicious comments and the intimidation that my family have received in the last week,"" he said. ""But I have learned from dad that there's a time to speak and a time to be silent."" He said talks to try to save the workforce were ongoing and he did not want to say anything that would jeopardise the negotiations. During the service, anyone affected by the collapse was asked to stand while the rest of the congregation prayed for them. Mr Wright said he was working hard to ensure there was future employment for the workers. Wrightbus's majority shareholder is Jeff Wright, who leads Green Pastures, a religious charity The Green Pastures charity received Â£15m in donations from Wrightbus over six years, and some workers have expressed concern the donations weakened the business. The Wright family, who founded Wrightbus in 1946, say the collapse of the business was due to a big fall in demand for buses in the UK market. The group, which had been suffering from financial problems and was up for sale, went into administration on Wednesday.

"Boris Johnson denies wrongdoing over Arcuri linkThe PM says there was ""no interest to declare"" regarding links with US businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri.UK Politics","This video can not be played Boris Johnson: 'Everything has been done with full propriety' Boris Johnson says there was ""no interest to declare"" regarding links with US businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri. It is alleged Ms Arcuri received favourable treatment due to her friendship with Mr Johnson. The police watchdog are deciding whether to investigate the prime minister for a potential criminal offence of misconduct in public office while he was London mayor. Mr Johnson said everything had been done ""with full propriety"". The allegations,first reported in the Sunday Times,external, claim Ms Arcuri joined trade missions led by Mr Johnson when he was mayor of London and that her company received several thousand pounds in sponsorship grants. The paper has also reported Ms Arcuri told four friends that she had an affair with Mr Johnson while he was mayor of London. On Friday, the Greater London Authority's monitoring officer referred the prime minister to the Independent Office of Police Conduct (IOPC) - whose job it is to oversee the conduct of the mayor and other members of the GLA. PM defends actions over conflict of interest claims PM will explain Jennifer Arcuri links to City Hall PM's referral to watchdog 'politically motivated' Asked on the Andrew Marr show if he had declared any interest, Mr Johnson said ""there was no interest to declare"". ""I was proud of everything I did as mayor of London,"" he added. He also attacked Sadiq Khan, the current mayor of London, saying the Labour politician ""could possibly spend more time investing in police officers than he is investing in press officers and peddling this kind of stuff"". Mr Johnson added that someone in his position ""expects a lot of shot and shell"". The woman at the centre of this story is Jennifer Arcuri, who describes herself on Twitter as an entrepreneur, cyber security expert and producer. She began her career as a DJ on Radio Disney, before moving into film - where she wrote, produced and directed a short film that went on to be sold at Cannes Film Festival. Ms Arcuri then brought in her tech skills to create a streaming platform for independent film makers. But it was her founding of The Innotech Network in London that saw her path cross with Boris Johnson. The network hosts events to discuss tech policy, and Mr Johnson was the keynote speaker at the first of those in 2012. Since then, Ms Arcuri has also founded another company called Hacker House, which uses ethical hackers to find tech solutions for businesses. Speaking on Sky News, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the prime minister did not have questions to answer regarding alleged links with the US businesswoman. ""Any monies involved went through proper due process - this was a long time ago. ""Of course, in politics, there is always squalls and there are always debates about individuals."" But Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the GLA's monitoring officer had made a ""wholly independent assessment"" and decided there were ""serious questions to answer"". In a letter to Mr Johnson, the monitoring officer set out their reasons for referring the matter to the police watchdog. ""During this time [2008 - 2016] it has been brought to my attention that you maintained a friendship with Ms Jennifer Arcuri and as a result of that friendship allowed Ms Arcuri to participate in trade missions and receive sponsorship monies in circumstances when she and her companies could not have expected otherwise to receive those benefits,"" it said. The monitoring officer said it had referred the PM to the IOPC ""so it can assess whether or not it is necessary to investigate the former mayor of London for the criminal offence of misconduct in public office"". It said it had recorded a ""conduct matter"" against Mr Johnson, which happens when there is information that indicates a criminal offence may have been committed. But it does not mean that a criminal offence is proved in any way, the monitoring officer added.

"Government plans billions for hospital projectsThe plans, unveiled at the start of the Conservative conference, include Â£2.7bn for six hospital trusts over five years.UK Politics","This video can not be played Boris Johnson: This is the moment to invest in our NHS for the long term The government has pledged billions for hospital projects across England, at the start of the Conservative party conference. The plans include a Â£2.7bn investment for six hospitals over five years. A new approach to NHS mental health treatment will also be trialled in 12 areas of England - with housing and job support alongside psychological help. NHS Providers welcomed the funding but said more was needed to make up for ""a decade of capital squeeze"". The organisation, which represents trusts in England, said the NHS's annual capital spending of around Â£6bn needed to double over the next five to 10 years to meet its needs. The government says Â£70m is also being invested in the mental health pilot areas, with the NHS building more ties with charities and local councils. About 1,000 extra specialist staff will be recruited in 12 pilot sites, with expertise in a range of mental health issues, the government says. Under plans drawn up by Health Secretary Matt Hancock, the government has said Â£13bn will be spent on hospital projects, including entirely new buildings or revamping existing structures to improve facilities. The same pot of money will also be used to develop plans for further projects in the future. Mr Hancock said the funding would come from taxpayers, rather than PFI contracts whereby private firms fund the cost of building facilities and, in return, the state makes payments over a stipulated period of time for their use and management. The six hospital trusts to benefit from the Â£2.7bn in funding are: Whipps Cross Hospital, in Leytonstone, east London Epsom and St Helier Trust West Hertfordshire Trust Princess Alexandra Hospital Trust University Hospitals of Leicester Trust Leeds Teaching Hospitals Trust. Mr Hancock told Sky News's Sophy Ridge on Sunday programme that funding for these six trusts was in place so building work could begin ""straight away"". A further 34 hospitals will receive Â£100m in initial funding to start developing projects, including Addenbrookes Hospital in Cambridge, the Queen's Medical Centre in Nottingham and the North Manchester General Hospital. The remaining projects, including up to a dozen smaller community hospitals in Dorset, would be completed over the second half of the next decade. The plans also include Â£200m for replacing MRI, CT scanners and breast cancer screening equipment. The government has certainly tried to grab the headlines with its claim that 40 new hospitals are to be built in England. But the announcement is very scant on detail. While we know which places these new hospitals will be built in, we don't know the scale of the plans. For example, when the government announced 20 projects in the summer it turned out that some amounted to little more than re-development of wards and clinics in the community. The green light has been given to six schemes - and with Â£2.7bn of funding attached we can assume they will be pretty substantial. But it's far from certain that will be the case for the other 34. The government has basically given health bosses the go-ahead to draw up plans, not to actually build them. The money being talked about to pay for them in the long-term suggests some may be on a smaller-scale. The final - and perhaps most important - element to be decided is just how much the budget for buildings is to be increased by in the coming years to pay for all this. Around Â£7bn is being spent this year, but there is already a huge backlog of repairs and maintenance that needs to be done. If ministers are serious about these new buildings and tackling that, the budget will have to increase substantially. NHS Providers chief executive Chris Hopson said the commitments were ""significant"" and ""particularly good news"" for the six hospitals that would directly benefit. However, he said funding to complete schemes in 34 other hospitals had not yet been allocated. ""It's not just these six hospitals who have crumbling, outdated, infrastructure - community and mental health trusts, ambulance services and other hospitals across the country have equally pressing needs,"" he added. Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said the government's announcement that it was building 40 new hospitals had ""quickly unravelled as spin"". ""This isn't 40 new hospitals, it is just reconfiguring six,"" he said. ""New investment is desperately needed and of course we welcome any genuine new money, but patients and demoralised NHS staff are fed up of being taken for fools like this."" Brexit promises as Tory conference begins NHS plan: What it means for you Is NHS buildings boost all it seems? PM 'glad' about father's hospital confrontation The government said there would be an extra Â£2.3bn a year by 2023-4 to improve mental health care and Â£975m of funding was earmarked to provide community mental health provision. The 2.3bn figure was announced when the government outlined its future priorities for the NHS in January under theNHS Long Term Plan,external. The 12 pilot areas will be funded from this pot. Mental health minister Nadine Dorries said the plans for a new approach to mental health treatment and Â£70m of investment in pilot areas would begin a ""step-change"" in provision. This video can not be played Boris Johnson confronted during London hospital visit The pilot areas will cover services in the Humber, Coast and Vale Health and Care Partnership, Frimley Health and Care, and Surrey Heartlands; providers for Cambridge and Peterborough; Hertfordshire and West Essex; north-west London; north-east London; Herefordshire and Worcestershire; Lincolnshire; South Yorkshire and Bassetlaw; Cheshire and Merseyside, and Somerset. Ministers say the plans will involve a range of mental health issues, including eating disorders and alcohol addiction, psychosis and bipolar disorder. Speaking ahead of the start of the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester, Ms Dorries added: ""We know there are many causes behind mental illness - including significant life changes, problems at work or addiction - so it is only right that the NHS brings services together to serve patients in their communities."" Meanwhile, the prime minister has unveiled a Â£200m cash injection for the UK's health and life sciences industry. The funding will be matched by Â£400m of private investment to allow science companies to expand development plans. This government hopes the investment will allow companies to raise capital to run clinical trials, employ more industrial scientists and boost manufacturing in the UK. Boris Johnson said it was part of his vision to have a ""vibrant post-Brexit economy fuelled by science and technology"". He said: ""The UK has the best universities in the world and we have a proud history of scientific discovery from penicillin to sequencing the human genome. But too often we let another country commercialise this discovery. ""I want the lifesaving cancer treatments of tomorrow to say 'discovered and made in Britain'. That means allowing enough late stage capital to be mobilised so that these science discoveries do not have to go overseas to be commercialised.""

"Boris Johnson denies wrongdoing over Arcuri linkThe PM says there was ""no interest to declare"" regarding links with US businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri.","This video can not be played Boris Johnson: 'Everything has been done with full propriety' Boris Johnson says there was ""no interest to declare"" regarding links with US businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri. It is alleged Ms Arcuri received favourable treatment due to her friendship with Mr Johnson. The police watchdog are deciding whether to investigate the prime minister for a potential criminal offence of misconduct in public office while he was London mayor. Mr Johnson said everything had been done ""with full propriety"". The allegations,first reported in the Sunday Times,external, claim Ms Arcuri joined trade missions led by Mr Johnson when he was mayor of London and that her company received several thousand pounds in sponsorship grants. The paper has also reported Ms Arcuri told four friends that she had an affair with Mr Johnson while he was mayor of London. On Friday, the Greater London Authority's monitoring officer referred the prime minister to the Independent Office of Police Conduct (IOPC) - whose job it is to oversee the conduct of the mayor and other members of the GLA. PM defends actions over conflict of interest claims PM will explain Jennifer Arcuri links to City Hall PM's referral to watchdog 'politically motivated' Asked on the Andrew Marr show if he had declared any interest, Mr Johnson said ""there was no interest to declare"". ""I was proud of everything I did as mayor of London,"" he added. He also attacked Sadiq Khan, the current mayor of London, saying the Labour politician ""could possibly spend more time investing in police officers than he is investing in press officers and peddling this kind of stuff"". Mr Johnson added that someone in his position ""expects a lot of shot and shell"". The woman at the centre of this story is Jennifer Arcuri, who describes herself on Twitter as an entrepreneur, cyber security expert and producer. She began her career as a DJ on Radio Disney, before moving into film - where she wrote, produced and directed a short film that went on to be sold at Cannes Film Festival. Ms Arcuri then brought in her tech skills to create a streaming platform for independent film makers. But it was her founding of The Innotech Network in London that saw her path cross with Boris Johnson. The network hosts events to discuss tech policy, and Mr Johnson was the keynote speaker at the first of those in 2012. Since then, Ms Arcuri has also founded another company called Hacker House, which uses ethical hackers to find tech solutions for businesses. Speaking on Sky News, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the prime minister did not have questions to answer regarding alleged links with the US businesswoman. ""Any monies involved went through proper due process - this was a long time ago. ""Of course, in politics, there is always squalls and there are always debates about individuals."" But Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the GLA's monitoring officer had made a ""wholly independent assessment"" and decided there were ""serious questions to answer"". In a letter to Mr Johnson, the monitoring officer set out their reasons for referring the matter to the police watchdog. ""During this time [2008 - 2016] it has been brought to my attention that you maintained a friendship with Ms Jennifer Arcuri and as a result of that friendship allowed Ms Arcuri to participate in trade missions and receive sponsorship monies in circumstances when she and her companies could not have expected otherwise to receive those benefits,"" it said.

Two dead in Mexico rollercoaster crash,"La Feria Chapultepec amusement park was closed after Saturday's incident A rollercoaster carriage has derailed in Mexico City, killing at least two people. Another two were injured in the accident at La Feria Chapultepec amusement park on Saturday. Eyewitnesses said the victims fell from the last carriage of the Chimera rollercoaster in the park. The popular park was closed soon after the incident, and the authorities are now investigating the cause of the derailment. ""This is now in the hands of prosecutors, and prosecutors have already taken the necessary steps for an investigation,"" Miriam UrzÃºa, an official from the civil protection organisation, told Reuters news agency. She said the investigation would be exploring both what happened and who was responsible. Eyewitness Rosalba RodrÃ­guez told reporters there was nothing out of the ordinary about the ride, which had completed a few loops, until she saw the last carriage fall. The fair said it ""deeply regrets the terrible accident"" and that it was investigating alongside the relevant authorities. It also promised to share details of the investigation as they emerged. Video from the scene showed paramedics tending to the wounded, while police kept spectators away from the shuttered park.

The deep cuts behind China's extraordinary rise,"China's version of its past is a story of prosperity, progress and sacrifice for the common good China's extraordinary rise was a defining story of the 20th Century, but as it prepares to mark its 70th anniversary, the BBC's John Sudworth in Beijing asks who has really won under the Communist Party's rule. Sitting at his desk in the Chinese city of Tianjin, Zhao Jingjia's knife is tracing the contours of a face. Cut by delicate cut, the form emerges - the unmistakable image of Mao Zedong, founder of modern China. The retired oil engineer discovered his skill with a blade only in later life and now spends his days using the ancient art of paper cutting to glorify leaders and events from China's communist history. ""I'm the same age as the People's Republic of China (PRC),"" he says. ""I have deep feelings for my motherland, my people and my party."" For people like Zhao Jingjia, China's success outweighs the ""mistakes"" of its leaders Born a few days before 1 October 1949 - the day the PRC was declared by Mao - Mr Zhao's life has followed the dramatic contours of China's development, through poverty, repression and the rise to prosperity. Now, in his modest but comfortable apartment, his art is helping him make sense of one of the most tumultuous periods of human history. ""Wasn't Mao a monster,"" I ask, ""responsible for the deaths of tens of millions of his countrymen?"" ""I lived through it,"" he replies. ""I can tell you that Chairman Mao did make some mistakes but they weren't his alone. ""I respect him from my heart. He achieved our nation's liberation. Ordinary people cannot do such things."" How the Communist Party runs China On Tuesday, China will present a similar, glorious rendering of its record to the world. The country is staging one of its biggest ever military parades, a celebration of 70 years of Communist Party rule as pure, political triumph. Beijing will tremble to the thunder of tanks, missile launchers and 15,000 marching soldiers, a projection of national power, wealth and status watched over by the current Communist Party leader, President Xi Jinping, in Tiananmen Square. Like Mr Zhao's paper-cut portraits, we're not meant to focus on the many individual scars made in the course of China's modern history. It is the end result that matters. This video can not be played 'I was so proud and excited to join the parade' And, on face value, the transformation has been extraordinary. On 1 October 1949, Chairman Mao stood in Tiananmen Square urging a war-ravaged, semi-feudal state into a new era with a founding speech and a somewhat plodding parade that could muster only 17 planes for the flyby. This week's parade, in contrast, will reportedly feature the world's longest range intercontinental nuclear missile and a supersonic spy-drone - the trophies of a prosperous, rising authoritarian superpower with a 400 million strong middle class. It is a narrative of political and economic success that - while in large part true - is incomplete. New visitors to China are often, rightly, awe-struck by the skyscraper-festooned, hi-tech megacities connected by brand new highways and the world's largest high-speed rail network. Those in China's glittering cities may accept the trade-off of political freedom for economic growth They see a rampant consumer society with the inhabitants enjoying the freedom and free time to shop for designer goods, to dine out and to surf the internet. ""How bad can it really be?"" the onlookers ask, reflecting on the negative headlines they've read about China back home. The answer, as in all societies, is that it depends very much on who you are. Many of those in China's major cities, for example, who have benefited from this explosion of material wealth and opportunity, are genuinely grateful and loyal. In exchange for stability and growth, they may well accept - or at least tolerate - the lack of political freedom and the censorship that feature so often in the foreign media. For them the parade could be viewed as a fitting tribute to a national success story that mirrors their own. But in the carving out of a new China, the knife has cut long and deep. Mao's man-made famine - a result of radical changes to agricultural systems - claimed tens of millions of lives and his Cultural Revolution killed hundreds of thousands more in a decade-long frenzy of violence and persecution, truths that are notably absent from Chinese textbooks. Tens of millions starved to death under Mao, as China radically restructured agriculture and society After his death, the demographically calamitous One Child Policy brutalised millions over a 40-year period. Still today, with its new Two Child Policy, the Party insists on violating that most intimate of rights - an individual's choice over her fertility. The list is long, with each category adding many thousands, at least, to the toll of those damaged or destroyed by one-party rule. Beijing still regulates how many children families can have There are the victims of religious repression, of local government land-grabs and of corruption. There are the tens of millions of migrant workers, the backbone of China's industrial success, who have long been shut out of the benefits of citizenship. A strict residential permit system continues to deny them and their families the right to education or healthcare where they work. And in recent years, there are the estimated one and a half million Muslims in China's western region of Xinjiang - Uighurs, Kazakhs and others - who have been placed in mass incarceration camps on the basis of their faith and ethnicity. China continues to insist they are vocational schools, and that it is pioneering a new way of preventing domestic terrorism. How did one man come to embody China's destiny? China's hidden camps: What's happened to the vanished Uighurs? Searching for truth in China's 're-education' camps China's Muslim 'crackdown' explained The stories of the dead, the jailed and the marginalised are always much more hidden than the stories of the assimilated and the successful. Viewed from their perspective, the censorship of large parts of China's recent history is not simply part of a grand bargain to be exchanged for stability and prosperity.  1949Mao declares the founding of the People's Republic of China 1966-76Cultural Revolution brings social and political upheaval 1977Deng Xiaoping initiates major reforms of China's economy 1989Army crushes Tiananmen Square pro-democracy protests 2010China becomes the world's second-largest economy 2018Xi Jinping is cleared to be president for life It is something that makes the silence of their suffering all the more difficult to penetrate. It is the job of foreign journalists, of course, to try. But while censorship can shut people up, it cannot stop them remembering. Prof Guo Yuhua, a sociologist at Beijing's Tsinghua University, is one of the few scholars left trying to record, via oral histories, some of the huge changes that have affected Chinese society over the past seven decades. Her books are banned, her communications monitored and her social media accounts are regularly deleted. ""For several generations people have received a history that has been falsified, faked, glorified and whitewashed,"" she tells me, despite having been warned not to talk to the foreign media ahead of the parade. ""I think it requires the entire nation to re-study and to reflect on history. Only if we do that can we ensure that these tragedies won't be repeated."" Can progress really be attributed to the leadership? A parade, she believes, that puts the Communist Party at the front and centre of the story, misses the real lesson, that China's progress only began after Mao, when the party loosened its grip a bit. ""People are born to strive for a better, happier and more respectful life, aren't they?"" she asks me. ""If they are provided with a tiny little space, they'll try to make a fortune and solve their survival problems. This shouldn't be attributed to the leadership."" As if to prove the point about how the unsettled, censored pasts of authoritarian states continue to impact the present, the parade is for invited guests only. Mao's portrait will, as it always is, be watching over the events in Tiananmen Square Another anniversary, of which Tiananmen Square is the centrepiece, is also being measured in multiples of 10 - it is 30 years since the bloody suppression of the pro-democracy protests that shook the foundations of Communist Party rule. The troops will be marching - as they always do on these occasions - down the same avenue on which the students were gunned down. The risk of even a lone protester using the parade to mark a piece of history that has largely been wiped from the record is just too great. With central Beijing sealed off, ordinary people in whose honour it is supposedly being held, can only watch it on TV. Back in his Tianjin apartment, Zhao Jingjia shows me the intricate detail of a series of scenes, each cut from a single piece of paper, depicting the ""Long March"", a time of hardship and setback for the Communist Party long before it eventually swept to power. ""Our happiness nowadays comes from hard work,"" he tells me. It is a view that echoes that of the Chinese government which, like him, has at least acknowledged that Mao made mistakes while insisting they shouldn't be dwelt on. ""As for the 70 years of China, it's extraordinary,"" he says. ""It can be seen by all. Yesterday we sent two navigation satellites into space - all citizens can enjoy the convenience that these things bring us."" This video can not be played What was China's Cultural Revolution?

'Forgotten brothers and sisters' remembered,"Former children's home residents and abuse survivors have gathered at the end of a campaign to reinstate headstones for hundreds of children who lay in unmarked graves. A white rose was laid in remembrance for each of the 335 children buried in Quarriers village in Renfrewshire. They were laid to rest in the village's Nittinghill Graveyard from 1888 until 1971 but their gravestones were removed in the 1960s. Former resident Sandy Smith has led a two-year campaign to reinstate the headstones. The campaign began when it emerged that 80 headstones marking the graves of children who died while they lived at Quarriers children's home near Bridge of Weir had inexplicably disappeared. A plaque was unveiled in memory of their ""brothers and sisters"" who lie buried in the cemetery Mr Smith believes those children would still be lying in unmarked graves today if he hadn't returned six years ago to the place where he spent his childhood. Quarriers is one of several organisationsinvestigated in the Scottish Child Abuse Inquiryabout abuse inflicted upon some children in its care. A resident of Quarriers from the age of five, and a victim of abuse, Mr Smith struggled with his childhood experiences. After an attempt to take his own life and the breakdown of his marriage, he reconnected with his past - and other children from Quarriers - through an online forum in 2013. He found a friend he first met in at the children's home in 1956. He had not seen her since she was removed from the home a few years later. Sandy Smith and Jayne Savery when they were residents at Quarrier's as children After meeting up with Jayne Savery, they became a couple and revisited the site of the home in 2013 in a bid to relive some happy memories. They were shocked to find that when they entered the cemetery, the graves they remembered were gone. Ms Savery said: ""Only a Quarriers child would have noticed that they were removed. As a little girl I used to play hopscotch using the gravestones as stepping stones as at that time they were flat on the ground."" Mr Smith was angry and upset. He said: ""Over time, it preyed on my mind and eventually in 2017, I called Quarriers. ""I asked why they had been removed but no one could answer that. They promised the stones would be replaced by March or April 2018."" In January 2018,the Quarriers charity apologised ""for any distress caused"" over the removal of headstonesfrom Nittingshill cemetery and said it had plans to have them reinstated. However, this took some time, with rows of stones gradually reinstated over the course of nearly two years. Quarrier's village with Mount Zion church at the centre The last headstone was placed at the cemetery in August. On Thursday, the stones were dedicated in a ceremony organised by Quarriers. A total of 155 grave markers now show all the names of children buried there. Mr Smith's support group, Quarriers Warriors, organised a memorial service on Sunday to mark the return of the headstones. He said: ""Now these children can be remembered once more. They will be rejoicing in heaven knowing we did not forget them and they will always be remembered."" Alice Harper, chief executive of Quarriers said: ""It was extremely important to Quarrier's to put grave markers in place. ""Having been approached by a group representing former residents requesting our support, we made an early commitment to putting grave markers in place as we agreed it was the right thing to do. ""Until now, children had been remembered and recognised with a plaque stating their name, age and year of death."" Sandy Smith has led a two-year campaign to reinstate the gravestones The stories of the first three children laid to rest at Quarrier's Nittingshill cemetery were shared at the dedication service on Thursday. Ten years after the village was established, William Sinclair, William Kean, and Sarah McLeod were buried there. Orphaned at the age of three, William Sinclair went to Quarrier's in December 1887 but died just four months later. William Kean, the eldest of four children, arrived aged nine in April 1887. Their father, a brewery carter, expressed a strong desire for the children to be placed at Quarrier's. William died in May 1888 after a short illness. His siblings were migrated to Canada. Sarah McLeod was the middle child of John, a baker from Skye and Mary from Dingwall. Sarah came to Quarrier's in 1887 along with sister Bella, 10, and brother Archie, 5. Sarah died of heart disease in May 1888. Bella returned to her mother and Archie was migrated to Canada. The central building at Quarrier's village in the 1920s Quarriers Village was established in 1878 by philanthropist William Quarrier, a successful merchant who had started his working life at the age of seven as a pin maker. His charity was known as Orphan Homes of Scotland and was changed to Quarriers Homes in 1958. By the 1890s his ""children's village"" included 34 ""cottages"" a school and even a fire station -  based around Mount Zion Church and Nittingshill Cemetery. Children who were cared for by Quarriers could be buried at the cemetery, alongside William Quarrier, his family and local residents. From 1888 until 1971, 335 children were buried in Nittingshill Graveyard. Mount Zion Church is now a residential property. The Quarriers charity continues the work of the former homes and is based within the village.

A small number of demonstrators also gathered outside the conference venue on Saturday night when Mr Johnson arrived with his partner, Carrie Symonds.

Last week, Labour's Paula Sheriff said threats made to her and other MPs often quoted his ""dangerous"" language of ""surrender"" and ""betrayal"". She also referred to the murder of Labour MP Jo Cox in 2016, but Mr Johnson replied: ""I've never heard such humbug in all my life."" Boris Johnson and his partner Carrie Symonds arrived in Manchester on Saturday evening The PM said any such threats were ""deplorable"" but he did not regret ""using the word surrender to describe the surrender act"". ""Military metaphors are old, standard, Parliamentary terms,"" he continued. ""I think everybody should calm down,"" he said, but asked whether that included him, he added: ""I think I've been the model of restraint."" The Jo Cox Foundation - set up in memory of the murdered MP - hascalled on all political parties to agree to a code of conduct to help protect MPs. Cardinal Vincent Nichols, the UK's most senior Catholic clergyman, warned some of the language being used could encourage violent extremists. He told BBC Radio 4's Sunday programme political leaders had a particular responsibility to be respectful in public discourse. Commons Speaker John Bercow will hold an emergency meeting on Monday with party leaders over the use of ""inflammatory language"" in Parliament. Hilary Benn presented the bill in his name to Parliament When Mr Johnson talks about the ""surrender bill"", he is referring to the European Union (Withdrawal) (No. 2) Act, also known as the Benn Act after Labour MP Hilary Benn, who introduced the legislation to the Commons. The act - which became law earlier this month - stipulates the prime minister will have until 19 October to either pass a deal in Parliament or get MPs to approve a no-deal Brexit. Once this deadline has passed, he will have to request an extension to the UK's departure date to 31 January 2020 from the EU. If the EU responds by proposing a different date, the PM will have two days to accept that proposal. But during this two-day period, MPs - not the government - will have the opportunity to reject the EU's date. On Brexit, Mr Johnson said he still thought there was a ""good chance"" of getting a deal with the EU and the government was ""working incredibly hard"". Success depended on ""the common sense of our EU partners"", he argued, but said talks were ""not being helped"" by the Benn Act. ""If they suspect or think there is a realistic chance the UK can be kept in [the EU], that clearly takes away a lot of our negotiating freedom."" The PM insisted that ""of course"" the UK could still leave without a deal on 31 October despite the act - although he would not be drawn on how that could happen. Mr Johnson also ruled out bringing back the withdrawal agreement negotiated between Theresa May and the EU, and dismissed suggestions he could resign rather than ask for an extension. There's no sign whatsoever of Boris Johnson retreating from his strategy - the approach he's taken since he moved into Downing Street. And as far as many people in his team, and the wider party, are concerned their only real path to success is to stick to trying get Brexit done by 31 October. The tricky thing is, though, that it looks very unlikely - maybe even impossible. And there are plenty of people in Westminster who say they're prepared to do everything necessary to stop Mr Johnson doing what he wants to do - taking the UK out without a deal on that date if one isn't agreed. Party conferences are pretty much always like being in a parallel universe, but this week is going to be something else. Parliament will still be sitting while the Conservatives are gathering here in Manchester and it could certainly be a surreal and bumpy few days. Meanwhile,the Sunday Times has fresh allegations,externalabout the American businesswoman at the centre of claims about her links to the prime minister. The paper claims Jennifer Arcuri told four friends that she had an affair with Mr Johnson while he was mayor of London. On Friday, the Greater London Authority (GLA) referred Mr Johnson to the police watchdog over allegations Ms Arcuri, a US technology entrepreneur, received favourable treatment because of her friendship with him. Inside the conference hall, the ""Get Brexit Done"" message was clear But outside, protesters unhappy with Brexit and Conservative policies took to the streets She joined trade missions led by Mr Johnson while he was mayor and her company received several thousand pounds in sponsorship grants. The Independent Office for Police Conduct will now consider whether there are grounds to investigate the prime minister for the criminal offence of misconduct in public office. But Mr Johnson insisted he had ""no interest to declare"" when pressed by Andrew Marr over whether he made his personal relationship with her known at the time. ""Everything was was done with full propriety,"" he added. The PM also appeared to claim the story was politically motivated, saying someone in his position ""expects a lot of shot and shell"". This video can not be played Boris Johnson: 'Everything has been done with full propriety' As well as promises on hospitals, the government is also announcing a new approach to NHS mental health treatment to be trialled in 12 areas of England - with housing and job support alongside psychological help.

NHS 'reality check' for Boris Johnson,"Boris Johnson visited a hospital in Boston, Lincolnshire this week There has been a string of health announcements for England this week - funding for new buildings and equipment, a deal to sort out doctors' pension tax problems, and a new artificial intelligence lab. And Whitehall sources make clear there will be more to come when MPs return from their summer holidays next month. In his first NHS policy initiative, Boris Johnson said it was his ""mission"" to reduce the time people waited, both to see a GP and in accident and emergency units. It is understood that he sees the NHS as a priority in his first months in office and is attempting to seize the initiative ahead of a possibly imminent general election. But the latest statistics on the state of the NHS in England serve as a reality check for the new prime minister and his administration. Record numbers (2.27 million) came through the doors of A&E units in England in July, up 4% on the same month the previous year. The heatwave was given as one reason, but the underlying story is unchanged, which is worrying for health service leaders. Their aim has been to get more people treated away from hospitals in their local communities.  But the opposite is happening as more patients, some frustrated by difficulties getting GP appointments, are turning up at A&E and putting more pressure on hospitals. There were just over 554,000 emergency admissions to hospitals in July - the third highest monthly figure since modern records began and, what's more, in the middle of summer. More strain on A&E and more demand for urgent hospital care puts the squeeze on bed capacity. Is NHS buildings boost all it seems? 20 NHS building projects given green light Boris Johnson announces Â£1.8bn cash boost for NHS hospitals One major hospital reported being full. The result is that patients waiting for non-urgent surgery experience longer delays. The total waiting list in England has hit a new peak of 4.4 million. The number of patients waiting more than the 18-week target for routine operations and procedures has gone above 600,000 for the first time in a decade. The data will make sobering reading in Downing Street. Turning around NHS performance is a big ask. The cash boost for the front line this year, the first part of the five-year plan announced by Theresa May, has helped. But, as many analysts predicted, it has been barely enough to keep up with the increased demand for patient care, let alone reverse the backlog of operations or improve the A&E numbers. The Royal College of Surgeons says nothing short of a long-term plan to increase the number of beds and staff and resources to run the wards will suffice. Mr Johnson announced his own Â£1.8bn funding increase for the NHS, but for hospital buildings and equipment (the capital budget) rather than day-to-day spending.  So was it new money? That question has been hotly debated. Of that package, Â£850m is new in that it will be provided over five years by the Treasury to fund 20 hospital upgrade projects and had not been announced before. Much of the other Â£1bn actually comes from surpluses built up by hospitals in earlier years, which they were not allowed to spend at the time. That bar has now been lifted by the Treasury, which has given the green light for the hospitals to spend the money this year.  So it is not new cash, in the sense some members of the public might understand it. But it is funding which is newly available to the NHS. Sally Gainsbury, of the Nuffield Trust, was the first analyst to highlight the funding mechanism. She argued that ""to claim this as new money is a little like finally giving back the Â£10 you borrowed some time ago - and expecting to be applauded wildly"". However, the prime minister and health secretary continued to insist the Â£1.8bn was new money. The argument, according to sources, was that the funding had not been previously accessible and that the government announcement had freed it up to spend on improving hospitals. Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, tactfully concluded that both Ms Gainsbury and the government were correct. The result of the latest announcement is that the capital spending assumption for the current financial year in the Department of Health and Social Care accounts has been raised by Â£1bn. Whatever the argument about the nature of the funding in England, the devolved administrations will receive new money as a result of the usual mechanism (the Barnett formula applied to the Â£1.8bn package), amounting to a total of Â£350m for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. This may sound like an arcane wrangle over dry-as-dust accounting practices. But with a general election possibly not far off, it is important. Statements about where money is coming from and how it is spent will rightly be closely scrutinised, as will performance figures from the NHS front line.

"Government plans billions for hospital projectsThe plans, unveiled at the start of the Conservative party conference, include Â£2.7bn for six hospital trusts over five years.UK Politics","This video can not be played Boris Johnson: This is the moment to invest in our NHS for the long term The government has pledged billions for hospital projects across England, at the start of the Conservative party conference. The plans include a Â£2.7bn investment for six hospitals over five years. A new approach to NHS mental health treatment will also be trialled in 12 areas of England - with housing and job support alongside psychological help. NHS Providers welcomed the funding but said more was needed to make up for ""a decade of capital squeeze"". The organisation, which represents trusts in England, said the NHS's annual capital spending of around Â£6bn needed to double over the next five to 10 years to meet its needs. The government says Â£70m is also being invested in the mental health pilot areas, with the NHS building more ties with charities and local councils. About 1,000 extra specialist staff will be recruited in 12 pilot sites, with expertise in a range of mental health issues, the government says. Under plans drawn up by Health Secretary Matt Hancock, the government has said Â£13bn will be spent on hospital projects, including entirely new buildings or revamping existing structures to improve facilities. The same pot of money will also be used to develop plans for further projects in the future. Mr Hancock said the funding would come from taxpayers, rather than PFI contracts whereby private firms fund the cost of building facilities and, in return, the state makes payments over a stipulated period of time for their use and management. The six hospital trusts to benefit from the Â£2.7bn in funding are: Whipps Cross Hospital, in Leytonstone, east London Epsom and St Helier Trust West Hertfordshire Trust Princess Alexandra Hospital Trust University Hospitals of Leicester Trust Leeds Teaching Hospitals Trust. Mr Hancock told Sky News's Sophy Ridge on Sunday programme that funding for these six trusts was in place so building work could begin ""straight away"". A further 34 hospitals will receive Â£100m in initial funding to start developing projects, including Addenbrookes Hospital in Cambridge, the Queen's Medical Centre in Nottingham and the North Manchester General Hospital. The remaining projects, including up to a dozen smaller community hospitals in Dorset, would be completed over the second half of the next decade. The plans also include Â£200m for replacing MRI, CT scanners and breast cancer screening equipment. The government has certainly tried to grab the headlines with its claim that 40 new hospitals are to be built in England. But the announcement is very scant on detail. While we know which places these new hospitals will be built in, we don't know the scale of the plans. For example, when the government announced 20 projects in the summer it turned out that some amounted to little more than re-development of wards and clinics in the community. The green light has been given to six schemes - and with Â£2.7bn of funding attached we can assume they will be pretty substantial. But it's far from certain that will be the case for the other 34. The government has basically given health bosses the go-ahead to draw up plans, not to actually build them. The money being talked about to pay for them in the long-term suggests some may be on a smaller-scale. The final - and perhaps most important - element to be decided is just how much the budget for buildings is to be increased by in the coming years to pay for all this. Around Â£7bn is being spent this year, but there is already a huge backlog of repairs and maintenance that needs to be done. If ministers are serious about these new buildings and tackling that, the budget will have to increase substantially. NHS Providers chief executive Chris Hopson said the commitments were ""significant"" and ""particularly good news"" for the six hospitals that would directly benefit. However, he said funding to complete schemes in 34 other hospitals had not yet been allocated. ""It's not just these six hospitals who have crumbling, outdated, infrastructure - community and mental health trusts, ambulance services and other hospitals across the country have equally pressing needs,"" he added. Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said the government's announcement that it was building 40 new hospitals had ""quickly unravelled as spin"". ""This isn't 40 new hospitals, it is just reconfiguring six,"" he said. ""New investment is desperately needed and of course we welcome any genuine new money, but patients and demoralised NHS staff are fed up of being taken for fools like this."" Brexit promises as Tory conference begins NHS plan: What it means for you Is NHS buildings boost all it seems? PM 'glad' about father's hospital confrontation The government said there would be an extra Â£2.3bn a year by 2023-4 to improve mental health care and Â£975m of funding was earmarked to provide community mental health provision. The 2.3bn figure was announced when the government outlined its future priorities for the NHS in January under theNHS Long Term Plan,external. The 12 pilot areas will be funded from this pot. Mental health minister Nadine Dorries said the plans for a new approach to mental health treatment and Â£70m of investment in pilot areas would begin a ""step-change"" in provision. This video can not be played Boris Johnson confronted during London hospital visit The pilot areas will cover services in the Humber, Coast and Vale Health and Care Partnership, Frimley Health and Care, and Surrey Heartlands; providers for Cambridge and Peterborough; Hertfordshire and West Essex; north-west London; north-east London; Herefordshire and Worcestershire; Lincolnshire; South Yorkshire and Bassetlaw; Cheshire and Merseyside, and Somerset. Ministers say the plans will involve a range of mental health issues, including eating disorders and alcohol addiction, psychosis and bipolar disorder. Speaking ahead of the start of the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester, Ms Dorries added: ""We know there are many causes behind mental illness - including significant life changes, problems at work or addiction - so it is only right that the NHS brings services together to serve patients in their communities."" Meanwhile, the prime minister has unveiled a Â£200m cash injection for the UK's health and life sciences industry. The funding will be matched by Â£400m of private investment to allow science companies to expand development plans. This government hopes the investment will allow companies to raise capital to run clinical trials, employ more industrial scientists and boost manufacturing in the UK. Boris Johnson said it was part of his vision to have a ""vibrant post-Brexit economy fuelled by science and technology"". He said: ""The UK has the best universities in the world and we have a proud history of scientific discovery from penicillin to sequencing the human genome. But too often we let another country commercialise this discovery. ""I want the lifesaving cancer treatments of tomorrow to say 'discovered and made in Britain'. That means allowing enough late stage capital to be mobilised so that these science discoveries do not have to go overseas to be commercialised.""

On Brexit, Mr Johnson said he still thought there was a ""good chance"" of getting a deal with the EU and the government was ""working incredibly hard"". Success depended on ""the common sense of our EU partners"", he argued, but said talks were ""not being helped"" by the Benn Act. ""If they suspect or think there is a realistic chance the UK can be kept in [the EU], that clearly takes away a lot of our negotiating freedom."" The PM insisted that ""of course"" the UK could still leave without a deal on 31 October despite the act - although he would not be drawn on how that could happen. Mr Johnson also ruled out bringing back the withdrawal agreement negotiated between Theresa May and the EU, and dismissed suggestions he could resign rather than ask for an extension. There's no sign whatsoever of Boris Johnson retreating from his strategy - the approach he's taken since he moved into Downing Street. And as far as many people in his team, and the wider party, are concerned their only real path to success is to stick to trying get Brexit done by 31 October. The tricky thing is, though, that it looks very unlikely - maybe even impossible. And there are plenty of people in Westminster who say they're prepared to do everything necessary to stop Mr Johnson doing what he wants to do - taking the UK out without a deal on that date if one isn't agreed. Party conferences are pretty much always like being in a parallel universe, but this week is going to be something else. Parliament will still be sitting while the Conservatives are gathering here in Manchester and it could certainly be a surreal and bumpy few days. Meanwhile,the Sunday Times has fresh allegations,externalabout the American businesswoman at the centre of claims about her links to the prime minister. The paper claims Jennifer Arcuri told four friends that she had an affair with Mr Johnson while he was mayor of London. On Friday, the Greater London Authority (GLA) referred Mr Johnson to the police watchdog over allegations Ms Arcuri, a US technology entrepreneur, received favourable treatment because of her friendship with him. Inside the conference hall, the ""Get Brexit Done"" message was clear But outside, protesters unhappy with Brexit and Conservative policies took to the streets She joined trade missions led by Mr Johnson while he was mayor and her company received several thousand pounds in sponsorship grants. The Independent Office for Police Conduct will now consider whether there are grounds to investigate the prime minister for the criminal offence of misconduct in public office. But Mr Johnson insisted he had ""no interest to declare"" when pressed by Andrew Marr over whether he made his personal relationship with her known at the time. ""Everything was was done with full propriety,"" he added. The PM also appeared to claim the story was politically motivated, saying someone in his position ""expects a lot of shot and shell"". This video can not be played Boris Johnson: 'Everything has been done with full propriety' As well as promises on hospitals, the government is also announcing a new approach to NHS mental health treatment to be trialled in 12 areas of England - with housing and job support alongside psychological help. Chancellor Sajid Javid is expected to speak on Monday and Home Secretary Priti Patel - talking about tackling crime - on Tuesday. Animal welfare policies, environmental plans - including a proposed Â£1bn fund to boost the electric motor industry and a pledge to plant one million new trees -are on the agenda.

Hospitals relying on 'emergency' loans,"""Emergency"" loans cost hospitals Â£185m in interest paid back to the government in 2018-19 Hospitals in England are ""lurching"" from month to month on ""emergency"" government loans to cover costs, a think tank has said. The Nuffield Trust said some NHS hospitals had to cut spending on patients to pay the interest. Trusts owed Â£10bn to the government in 2018-19 for ""interim revenue support"" and paid Â£185m in interest last year. The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said the money went back to the NHS. The amount of money loaned by the government to NHS trusts in England doubled between 2016-17 to 2018-19,BBC analysis of official figures shows,external. Interim revenue support was given to 122 NHS trusts, according to DHSC's annual reports. It allows hospitals and other healthcare providers to meet running costs while running at a deficit. However the trusts have to pay them back with interest. Sally Gainsbury, senior policy analyst for The Nuffield Trust, said hospitals were already unable to cover costs and were being forced to make further cuts in spending on patients to pay interest charges. ""Many hospitals can only survive by lurching from month to month with emergency bailouts from central government,"" she said. ""While it is true that interest paid to the department can in theory be recycled back out to the NHS, there is by no means a guarantee that it will go back to the individual NHS organisations that paid it. ""That leaves NHS trusts in the greatest financial difficulty unable to plan their future and make spending decisions that best suit their patients."" Siva Anandaciva, chief analyst for health charity The King's Fund said some hospitals and providers would be ""unable to pay their staff and suppliers on time"" without the extra cash brought in by government loans. ""In other words, they would be bankrupt,"" he said. However, he added it was ""inconceivable"" that an NHS ambulance service, hospital or mental health provider would be allowed to go bust. ""DHSC may eventually have to bite the bullet and write off these debts or at least accept that they will not be paid back on time,"" he added. Boris Johnson 'glad' about new father's NHS confrontation The questions facing the NHS in 2019 Is NHS buildings boost all it seems? Rachel Power, chief executive of The Patients Association charity, said: ""The sustained period of underfunding in recent years has caused problems that will be harming patient care for years to come, as money is diverted around the system to balance books and recover deficits, not for the benefit of patients."" King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust currently has the largest debt to the government. Borrowing by King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust in London more than doubled from Â£244m to more than Â£510m between 2016 and 2019, the equivalent to nearly half of its income over the last year. The trust, which has been infinancial special measures since 2017, spent Â£136m more on patient care than it was given last year and in its annual accounts admitted to being ""reliant"" on government loans. It has the largest debt to the government of any hospital trust in England. A trust spokesman said it had been ""in significant financial difficulty for a number of years"" and the loans provided ""working capital"". ""Without these loans the trust would find it difficult to maintain its current services for any length of time,"" he added. A spokeswoman for London's Barts Health NHS Trust also said it had ""historical"" debt, but added it had ""consistently reduced its underlying deficit"". The trust, also in special measures, said it was ""usual NHS practice"" to take out loans with the government to cover losses and it was working closely with regulators to address its financial issues. A spokesman for the DHSC said: ""NHS trusts rightly have the responsibility to manage their finances but where trusts do struggle financially, we will provide short-term loans to ensure they continue to run vital services and provide outstanding care to patients, with the interest paid going back to the NHS."" ""We are also backing the NHS with an extra Â£33.9 billion a year by 2023-24 in cash to support our long term plan, which aims to ensure no provider is in deficit by 2024."" 20 NHS building projects given green light NHS trust will stay in special measures Troubled trust out of special measures Department of Health and Social Care Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser LA mayor says winds and drought created 'perfect storm', while official hits out at looters Maps and pictures chart how fires have spread Biden praises Carter's character as former president's casket heads to Georgia The '9/11 mastermind' is set to plead guilty.

"Drugs, poison and corrupt guards: Inside festival crime","A security guard is filmed trying to smuggle drugs into a festival as part of a new BBC Three documentary. âHow are you gonna get this in?â A BBC Three reporter is sitting in a car, holding a tennis-ball-sized package sheâs just been passed by the man in the driverâs seat. The man is a security guard who works at music festivals, and the package contains 500g of MDMA and cocaine. In new BBC Three documentaryÂFestival Drugs: Meet The Dealers, reporter Livvy Haydock finds out how some gangs try to get their product into festivals, and sees first hand what other substances are mixed into the drugs that people are buying there. She meets a dealer who shows her on camera how he mixes rat poison with drugs he intends to sell, and follows two other dealers who smuggle their product outside the UK to sell at festivals abroad. Back in the car, the man Livvy is talking to calls himself âThe Transporterâ. She wants to find out just how easy it is for security staff like him to get drugs into a festival. Because itâs his job to search people, the Transporter isnât worried about being caught himself. âIâm a security officer,â the man, dressed all in black, replies calmly. âIâll get it in.â Bringing this package through the festival gates will make him Â£1,000. When doing this type of work, the Transporter uses a fake version of the security ID that all staff have to carry called an SIA (Security Industry Authority) pass. He bought his for Â£300 from a black market seller. The Transporter with his fake security ID strapped to his arm Heâs a real security guard, and works legitimately at multiple festivals across the summer. But the money heâll earn bringing drugs into events for a gang far outstrips his hourly wage manning festival gates. He turns up at festivals on days when he isnât actually booked to work, relying on the fact that events are often under-staffed and require an extra pair of hands at the last minute. Watching him slip the package into his pocket, Livvy notes that he hasnât even bothered to hide it. If heâs caught with the drugs on him, he could be jailed for life. âWhy should I stash it? Nobodyâs gonna search me,â he replies. âThis is my job.â The whistleblower tells Livvy Haydock people get festival security work with ""very little checks"" A different man who also works in festival security tells BBC Three just how easy it is to secure work. âThereâs so many big festivals all at the same time up and down the country, the big [security] companies, they donât have the manpower,â he says. âTheyâll subcontract big chunks to different people. Theyâll put an advert on the internet and theyâll take anybody.â Jobs are frequently advertised online at short notice. âSocial media is awash during festival season with people advertising for staff for festivals,â he tells Livvy. âYou could get a job quite easily for a festival this weekend with very little checks.â There are 400,000 active security license holders in the UK but there have been examples of subcontracted security companiessupplying unlicensed guards,externalto festivals. The SIAhas prosecuted,externalmore than 30 people or security businesses in the last year. The documentary highlights the differing levels of security at festivals Livvy meets the Transporter again before he brings a package of MDMA, ketamine and cocaine into a London festival. He agrees to wear a camera as he walks through the gates with the drugs. Asked what his plan is, he says: âIâm heading straight to the festival - Iâm gonna blag it to come in.â The Transporter is confident he wonât be searched and tells Livvy it will take him around 15 minutes to get onto the site. The camera charts his journey as he wanders past security, crowds of ticketholders and groups of police, all with no problem. He asks a member of staff where the security office is but, as he arrives there, he receives a call from his contact in the gang. There's been a change of plan. Heâs told the dealers arenât actually on the festival site and he should leave the drugs at a cafe right by the ticket entrance instead. His contact tells him to leave the package in the toilets but, when he enters the cafe, he sees they're closed off. He gets access thanks to his security pass, and the person on the phone directs him to go into the second cubicle and to leave the drugs in the bin. Hidden camera footage shows where the Transporter is instructed to drop off his package Despite the fact the gang havenât got the package into the festival, the Transporter has still earned himself Â£1,000. Livvy meets with a dealer who calls himself Jacket. Heâs been selling drugs since he was 15 years old and party drugs are his main product - meaning festival season is a very lucrative time for him. Livvy wants to find out exactly what Jacket puts in the drugs he sells at festivals. At his house, Livvy watches him cooking up a mix of MDMA and mephedrone on his kitchen stove in a pan. He says he uses mephedrone, a former legal high that was banned under the 2016 psychoactive substances bill, to make the drug extra powerful. But later on in the process, Jacket does something which shocks Livvy. He begins to crush up pellets of rat poison and add them to the mix. The chemical, designed to kill vermin, iscommonly addedto street drugs. Livvy is concerned about the potential risks of this extra ingredient. âI can pretty much guarantee you when thatâs in its proper container, itâll say âdonât eat it, itâs not for human consumptionâ,â she tells him. âDoes that worry you?â Jacket says it doesnât, and thinks that his customers wouldnât care if they knew he added rat poison to the drugs he sells. His âcookâ highlights what police and experts have known for a long time - that if you buy drugs, you canât be sure exactly whatâs in them. Safety campaigners have called formore drug testing facilitiesto be made available at festivals so that people can find out what they contain. Last year,more than 8,000 peopleused such facilities provided by charity the Loop at UK festivals. At leastone teenagerdied in 2019 from a suspected drug overdose at a festival. The governmentâslatest crime surveyfound that Class A drug use had reached record levels in England and Wales following a slight rise. According to the Home Office, this increase is âprimarily drivenâ by powder cocaine and ecstasy use among 16-24-year-olds.

Cathedral eulogy to social media star cat,"Garfield visited the store in Ely almost daily since it opened in 2012 A cathedral service has heard tributes paid to a cat that achieved social media fame by hanging out at his local supermarket. Garfield died in the car park of his beloved Sainsbury's store in Ely, Cambridgeshire, in July. He was remembered at the city's cathedral, which each year holds a service in celebration of animals. Dogs, cats, a donkey, ferrets, guinea pigs and even birds were in the cathedral. Garfield was well-known at the supermarket where he spent most days lolling on a sofa in the lobby and being petted by customers. In the past all sorts of well-behaved animals have come along to the services Around 450 pet owners and animal lovers attended the service He amassed a fan-base of more than 7,000 people from across the globe, who followed his adventures on Facebook. However, he was hit by a car in the store's car park and died in July, aged 12. Around 450 pet owners and animal lovers attended the service. Canon James Garrard and Canon Jessica Martin, joined by her rescue dog Gonzo, celebrated the lives of animals in the community and blessed them. Author Cate Caruth, who wrote a book about Garfield, told the congregation: ""He was a pet for all those who could have no pet of their own."" Ms Caruth said ""the whole of Ely mourned"" when he died. Garfield had become something of a celebrity in Sainsbury's, Ely ""Garfield touched thousands of lives around the world,"" she said. She said the eulogy was not just for Garfield, but for anyone who had lost a pet. ""In remembering Garfield, we remember all those pets,"" she said. ""As the fictional Garfy might say, 'I'm not really gone. I'm just off on another adventure'."" After Garfield's death, his owners set up a charity page which so far has raised almost Â£2,000 for the local branch of Cats Protection.

Living next door to mum and dad,"For many of us, moving away from the family home is a rite of passage, with the idea of cutting the apron strings an appealing one. But it's not for everyone. These people explain what it's like to live next door to mum and dad. Gail Randall shares a driveway with her parents Gail Randalland her partner moved into the house next door to her parents Ken and Janet three years ago. ""The house was shared ownership so the affordability of it was good, but I did also want to live near my parents,"" she says. Gail's front door is less than 10ft (3m) away from her mum and dad's and there is a shared driveway connecting the houses in Plymouth. When she first looked into buying the house, Gail says ""a lot of things"" went through her mind but any doubts were quickly forgotten. ""They don't ask where we are and when we are away, they look after the house,"" she says. Gail and her partner Lisa love living next door to Ken and Janet ""The only reason we'd move is if we decided to have a bigger family. My partner already has a son but if we were to have more than one other child, we'd have to get a bigger house. We have joked about if we do have children, we could knock the houses through so they can come and go as they please! But we'd never move, because of my parents."" Aside from finding it ""comforting"" to live where she grew up, there's another benefit to having some familiar faces next door. ""They help do our garden and look after our pet tortoise,"" she says. ""We don't have grass so she goes next door to Mum and Dad's to eat theirs!"" Wendy Lewis with her mum and uncle soon after she moved in next to her parents in August 1966 In 1965, the house next toWendy Lewis's parents was put up for sale - something she saw as a ""perfect opportunity"". ""My mother had just taken in my disabled uncle and I thought she really did need a hand to look after him,"" Wendy says. Although the house in Charmouth Road, St Albans, Hertfordshire, needed redecorating, Wendy and her husband Jim thought it was worth taking on ""because it was very cheap for that road"". House price aside, Wendy's husband was also ""absolutely happy"" to move in next door to his in-laws. A gate between the two houses meant Wendy's children could visit their grandparents easily ""At that time, he was doing a lot of extra work for my father who ran his own business - design work,"" Wendy says. ""He spent a lot of time at my parents' house drawing in the evening, so to be next door was absolutely ideal. We never had any problems at all."" Living next door to her parents was especially advantageous to Wendy's two children, Katy and Steve. ""They were very fond of their nan and grandad,"" Wendy says. ""They spent so much time with them, they were always over there. ""My daughter Katy, when I used to tell her off about something, she'd say 'I'm going to see Nan!' and off she'd go. It was very safe for her to do so when she was four or five years old as there was a little gate between the house's two yards. We never had any major problems whatsoever, everything was advantage."" ""It was so lovely to be right next door"" The living arrangements were also beneficial for Wendy's parents. ""They wanted us to move in,"" Wendy says, ""especially with the problems my mum had at that particular time with my uncle. ""It was so lovely to be right next door - I'd recommend it to anyone, absolutely."" ""When the chips are down, you probably go to your parents"" ""I think the psychological nesting concept is a really strong one, going back to something you sense is safe from your past,"" says Cary Cooper, professor of psychology and health at the Manchester Business School of the University of Manchester. ""If you look at the animal kingdom, they group together as a protective device."" There are ""obvious reasons"" for people wanting to live next door to their parents, he says, including having babysitters nearby and for support during difficult times. He points out there is now ""no network"" like there was a few decades ago, when cousins and other relatives often lived in the same community. ""That's gone now. We don't have the social support systems and most of us now are isolated. We're not near our extended family, we know a few of our neighbours but not many and that's the society that's developed over the last 30 years. Psychologically, given the pressures on people today, you'd think we'd want to be closer to our family but there is a stigma associated with saying 'I'm moving near my parents'. ""People will ask you why you're doing it, whether you can cope and the fact you're not a kid any more. But when times go bad, who do you turn to? When the chips are down, you probably go to your parents. I don't think that's unhealthy, I think it's quite healthy. You need that social support."" Husband and wife,Inderjit and Parminder Samra, from Smethwick in the West Midlands, have been living next door to Inderjit's parents for five years. For them though, that's a lot further away than they were - having previously lived with Inderjit's parents in their six-bedroom house along with his brother, sister-in-law and nephew. ""Our plan was to move out because we knew once we started having our own family, there wasn't going to be enough space for all of us under one roof,"" Inderjit says. ""But nothing really came up in the area we were looking at - we didn't like the houses. The house next door to my parents just happened to come up. ""Originally, we weren't keen on the idea because we wanted to move to a different area but we looked at the house and the more we looked at it, the more it started to grow on us. The fact it was next door to the family meant if we needed childcare, we wouldn't have to travel to drop the kids off. We just knew that mum and dad would be next door."" However, for Inderjit's wife, Parminder it took a bit of time to get used to the idea. ""Initially I wasn't on board, I'm going to be honest,"" she says. ""As much as we get on with the family, we wanted to move away and start our own life. As we were looking for properties though, it just didn't work."" The house next door to Inderjit's parents had an identical layout to the one they lived in with them. ""I think at the time for the kids - we only had one then but now have two - everything there was familiar,"" Parminder says. ""So in the end I just thought, bite my tongue and give it a go. If we didn't like it, we could think of another option. ""If you asked me five years ago, I was dead against it but now I wouldn't look back. My mother-in-law does a lot for us. My mum lives in Nottingham so for me, she's mum all the time."" Inderjit says their current living arrangement is ""all positive"". ""Both of us went into it half-heartedly,"" he says. ""It was a case of let's just move in and let's see how it goes, as the worst-case scenario was that we could sell the house - at least we'd given it a go. ""Now, we wouldn't even consider moving to another area.""

Photos 'celebrate beauty' of women over 40,"Jo Blackwell has been photographing women such as Judith, 75, without make up for her Face it, Own it project A blogger and photographer has said her pictures of women over 40 without make-up are a celebration of their beauty. Jo Blackwell, 58, has captured the images of 25 women so far and is aiming to gather 50 subjects for her Face it, Own it project. ""You very rarely see older women's faces without being airbrushed,"" the photographer, from Brixworth in Northamptonshire, said. ""I find it horrifying we've got to the stage where we feel that we have to put a mask on to be acceptable in society."" Jo Blackwell said women including Nikki, 46, have taken part for various reasons but ""they've got the confidence to face the world the way they are"" Since starting her blog eight years ago, Jo Blackwell has turned it into a book, launched a website and podcast Ms Blackwell said she became depressed after her children left home. ""I never thought 'what about me when they go?', I turned round and thought 'I don't know what I'm for anymore'. ""What got me out of the depression was writing a blog about being 50. ""People were commenting on the blog and and I felt reconnected with the world."" Rakhee, 42, said she had no desire to wear make-up and that so many women were beautiful in a natural way By photographing women such as Tracey, 46, without make-up Jo Blackwell said she hoped to break a ""societal expectation"" to look a certain way Following the blog, Ms Blackwell retrained as a portrait photographer, and earlier this yearlaunched her project,external. She said the women wanted to be photographed for a variety of reasons. ""Some are just grateful to be getting older, maybe they've been through illness. ""While others are tired of feeling like they've got to conform."" Bridget, 46, said she had her photo taken because ""not everyone has the blessing of getting older, every year life gets better"" Jo Blackwell said her photos of women such as Emma, 50, dispelled the ""male gaze"" which dictates how women look Ms Blackwell said: ""People will say 'oh you look good for your age' but that's a passive-aggressive backhanded compliment. ""I either look good or not, and that's your opinion anyway, but my age has nothing to do with it."" Ms Blackwell said she did not have a problem with people wearing make-up. ""But when you look at our daughters and the way they feel they can't go out the door without putting this mask on, I think we have a responsibility to lead the way,"" she said.

Government pledges Â£13bn for 40 new hospitals,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: This is the moment to invest in our NHS for the long term The government has pledged billions for hospital projects across England, at the start of the Conservative party conference. The plans include a Â£2.7bn investment for six hospitals over five years. A new approach to NHS mental health treatment will also be trialled in 12 areas of England - with housing and job support alongside psychological help. NHS Providers welcomed the funding but said more was needed to make up for ""a decade of capital squeeze"". The organisation, which represents trusts in England, said the NHS's annual capital spending of around Â£6bn needed to double over the next five to 10 years to meet its needs. The government says Â£70m is also being invested in the mental health pilot areas, with the NHS building more ties with charities and local councils. About 1,000 extra specialist staff will be recruited in 12 pilot sites, with expertise in a range of mental health issues, the government says. Under plans drawn up by Health Secretary Matt Hancock, the government has said Â£13bn will be spent on hospital projects, including entirely new buildings or revamping existing structures to improve facilities. The same pot of money will also be used to develop plans for further projects in the future. Mr Hancock said the funding would come from taxpayers, rather than PFI contracts whereby private firms fund the cost of building facilities and, in return, the state makes payments over a stipulated period of time for their use and management. The six hospital trusts to benefit from the Â£2.7bn in funding are: Whipps Cross Hospital, in Leytonstone, east London Epsom and St Helier Trust West Hertfordshire Trust Princess Alexandra Hospital Trust University Hospitals of Leicester Trust Leeds Teaching Hospitals Trust. Mr Hancock told Sky News's Sophy Ridge on Sunday programme that funding for these six trusts was in place so building work could begin ""straight away"". A further 34 hospitals will receive Â£100m in initial funding to start developing projects, including Addenbrookes Hospital in Cambridge, the Queen's Medical Centre in Nottingham and the North Manchester General Hospital. The remaining projects, including up to a dozen smaller community hospitals in Dorset, would be completed over the second half of the next decade. The plans also include Â£200m for replacing MRI, CT scanners and breast cancer screening equipment. The government has certainly tried to grab the headlines with its claim that 40 new hospitals are to be built in England. But the announcement is very scant on detail. While we know which places these new hospitals will be built in, we don't know the scale of the plans. For example, when the government announced 20 projects in the summer it turned out that some amounted to little more than re-development of wards and clinics in the community. The green light has been given to six schemes - and with Â£2.7bn of funding attached we can assume they will be pretty substantial. But it's far from certain that will be the case for the other 34. The government has basically given health bosses the go-ahead to draw up plans, not to actually build them. The money being talked about to pay for them in the long-term suggests some may be on a smaller-scale. The final - and perhaps most important - element to be decided is just how much the budget for buildings is to be increased by in the coming years to pay for all this. Around Â£7bn is being spent this year, but there is already a huge backlog of repairs and maintenance that needs to be done. If ministers are serious about these new buildings and tackling that, the budget will have to increase substantially. NHS Providers chief executive Chris Hopson said the commitments were ""significant"" and ""particularly good news"" for the six hospitals that would directly benefit. However, he said funding to complete schemes in 34 other hospitals had not yet been allocated. ""It's not just these six hospitals who have crumbling, outdated, infrastructure - community and mental health trusts, ambulance services and other hospitals across the country have equally pressing needs,"" he added. Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said the government's announcement that it was building 40 new hospitals had ""quickly unravelled as spin"". ""This isn't 40 new hospitals, it is just reconfiguring six,"" he said. ""New investment is desperately needed and of course we welcome any genuine new money, but patients and demoralised NHS staff are fed up of being taken for fools like this."" Brexit promises as Tory conference begins NHS plan: What it means for you Is NHS buildings boost all it seems? PM 'glad' about father's hospital confrontation The government said there would be an extra Â£2.3bn a year by 2023-4 to improve mental health care and Â£975m of funding was earmarked to provide community mental health provision. The 2.3bn figure was announced when the government outlined its future priorities for the NHS in January under theNHS Long Term Plan,external. The 12 pilot areas will be funded from this pot. Mental health minister Nadine Dorries said the plans for a new approach to mental health treatment and Â£70m of investment in pilot areas would begin a ""step-change"" in provision. This video can not be played Boris Johnson confronted during London hospital visit The pilot areas will cover services in the Humber, Coast and Vale Health and Care Partnership, Frimley Health and Care, and Surrey Heartlands; providers for Cambridge and Peterborough; Hertfordshire and West Essex; north-west London; north-east London; Herefordshire and Worcestershire; Lincolnshire; South Yorkshire and Bassetlaw; Cheshire and Merseyside, and Somerset. Ministers say the plans will involve a range of mental health issues, including eating disorders and alcohol addiction, psychosis and bipolar disorder. Speaking ahead of the start of the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester, Ms Dorries added: ""We know there are many causes behind mental illness - including significant life changes, problems at work or addiction - so it is only right that the NHS brings services together to serve patients in their communities."" Meanwhile, the prime minister has unveiled a Â£200m cash injection for the UK's health and life sciences industry. The funding will be matched by Â£400m of private investment to allow science companies to expand development plans. This government hopes the investment will allow companies to raise capital to run clinical trials, employ more industrial scientists and boost manufacturing in the UK. Boris Johnson said it was part of his vision to have a ""vibrant post-Brexit economy fuelled by science and technology"". He said: ""The UK has the best universities in the world and we have a proud history of scientific discovery from penicillin to sequencing the human genome. But too often we let another country commercialise this discovery. ""I want the lifesaving cancer treatments of tomorrow to say 'discovered and made in Britain'. That means allowing enough late stage capital to be mobilised so that these science discoveries do not have to go overseas to be commercialised.""
