Protesters face police over man's death,"People were protesting over the death of Edir Frederico Da Costa, aged 25 Fourteen police officers have been injured and four people arrested in a protest over the death of a young father following a traffic stop. Bricks were thrown and fires were lit outside Stratford bus station and Forest Gate police station in London. Protesters allege Edir Frederico Da Costa, 25, was ""brutally beaten"" by Met Police officers earlier this month. The police watchdog is investigating the treatment of Mr Da Costa, who died six days after he was stopped. Campaigners claim Mr Da Costa suffered serious injuries after being stopped by Met officers in a car containing three people. But the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) last week saida preliminary post-mortem examination ruled out a number of those injuries,external. ""Rigorous investigations"" into the cause of his death were continuing, it said. The police watchdog said it was releasing the information because it was concerned about the ""rapid spread of false and potentially inflammatory information"". The Met Police had earlier said six of its officers had been injured in the protest but released an update on Monday afternoon. It said four officers were taken to hospital for medical treatment. They include a male police sergeant who was knocked unconscious after an object struck his helmet, as well as officers with neck, leg and wrist injuries. All four officers have since been discharged from hospital. Edir Frederico Da Costa died on 21 June Earlier on Sunday evening, Borough Commander Supt Ian Larnder addressed of a group of protesters in an attempt to answer their questions and calm tensions. One protester rode his motorbike up to the police line and revved his engine in front of officers. Another motorcyclist turned his bike towards the officers and span his wheels so that smoke blew towards them. Inquiry into police stop death Protesters, some carrying Black Lives Matter posters, stood in front of a line of riot police Family campaigners said the violence was not coming from them Firefighters, protected by police, put out a fire which had been started in a bin in Richmond Road. Bins were also set alight near a McDonald's in Romford Road. One person was arrested on suspicion of disorder offences, while three other people were held on suspicion of arson and criminal damage. Family campaigners distanced themselves from the violence and insisted the march had been intended as a peaceful demonstration. Campaigners shouted ""we want justice"" as they faced off with police The force said the number of protesters started to dwindle just before 23:00 BST on Sunday. Mr Da Costa, known by friends as Edson, died on 21 June, six days after being stopped in a car in Woodcocks, Beckton, in Newham, east London. In a statement posted on an online GoFundMe page, his family said: ""This is a call for justice, not just for Edson but for all young men that are forgotten and unprotected in this reckless system."" They have called for any witnesses to come forward to the IPCC, in particular anyone with video footage. Nearly Â£5,000 has been raised on the fundraising site. Grime musician Stormzy tweeted#justiceforEdson,externallast Friday. Last week, Mr Larnder said in a statement: ""All police officers are fully aware that they will be asked to account for their actions - officers are not exempt from the law and we would not wish to be. ""I know that Edir's family, friends and the wider community want answers, but it is important that the [IPCC] investigation is allowed to take place to establish the full facts of what happened before any conclusions are made.""

Ed Sheeran closes Glastonbury 2017,"Pop star Ed Sheeran has headlined Glastonbury's Pyramid Stage, just six years after his debut at one of the festival's smallest venues. In 2011, the star played the solar-powered Croissant Neuf stage, playing ""to about 500 people"". On Sunday, he closed the festival, attracting a much younger audience than Friday and Saturday's headliners, Radiohead and Foo Fighters. The 26-year-old admitted he was ""very nervous but very excited"" to be there. Barry Gibb brings Glastonbury to its feet Hollywood invades Glastonbury ""For those of you who haven't seen one of my shows before or haven't heard one of my songs, please pretend that you know them,"" he told the audience. ""For those of you who have, please sing all of the words."" ""The aim of tonight is to lose our voices,"" he added. ""I'm going to lose mine as well."" The audience took him up on the challenge; joining in wistfully as he sang the ballads Photograph and Thinking Out Loud. They didn't quite keep up, however, with the spittle-flecked Take It Back - a whirlwind of wordplay in which Sheeran declared: ""I'm not a rapper, I'm a singer with a flow."" The star played, as he usually does, without a band; using a loop pedal to layer his vocal and guitar lines and create a backing track live, on the spot. This created problems during Bloodstream when his guitar slipped out of tune but, for the most part, the sound was impressive: Sheeran can build up or break down a song at will, a skill honed by years of relentless gigging in his teens. Sheeran attracted a significantly younger audience to the Pyramid Stage Highlights included The A-Team, which he sang illuminated by the audience, who held their phones aloft, creating the impression of 80,000 fireflies bobbing around the fields of Worthy Farm. Sheeran also invited traditional Irish band Beoga on stage to accompany him on Nancy Mulligan, a song about his paternal grandmother. It was a moment that reeked of cheese but, watched from the side of the stage by his grandfather, Sheeran made it seem genuine. This is the secret to his appeal. His brand of pop can be innocuous and twee - but Sheeran sells it with an earnest, everyman shtick that demolishes the divide between artist and audience. However you respond to his music, it is clear he strikes a chord, especially with the YouTube generation who prioritise relatability over the preening mannerisms of, say, Mick Jagger. Sheeran exploits it effortlessly. On headlining Glastonbury, he told the crowd: ""I'd like to say it was a dream of mine, but I never thought I'd get to the point where I was playing this stage, let alone headlining it."" Sheeran may have been on stage alone, but his impressive set helped fill Worthy Farm with colour And to Glastonbury itself, Sheeran's appeal to under-30s is paramount: those are the fans the festival needs to replenish its audience and survive. That's why this year saw more pop and grime acts than ever, from Charli XCX to Katy Perry; from Wiley to Stormzy. On Sunday, the festival also saw sets from Royal Blood, Courteeners, Foo Fighters, The Jacksons, Radiohead and The Killers - who played a secret show on the John Peel stage on Sunday evening. ""They say you play the John Peel Stage twice in your career - once on the way up, and once on the way down,"" said frontman Brandon Flowers. ""It's great to be back."" BBC Glastonbury - watch and listen to the festival live Backstage with Nile Rodgers Foo Fighters break the curfew Katy Perry crowdsurfs and Craig David triumphs The cheapest pint at Glastonbury Get to know Glastonbury's headliners Earlier in the day, the Pyramid Stage briefly turned into Studio 54, with consecutive sets from Bee Gee Barry Gibb and funk bandChic drawing one of the biggest crowdsof the weekend. And LA band Haim literally brought the audience at The Other Stage to its knees. The band, who were debuting songs from their new album, Something To Tell You, encouraged the crowd to dance lower and lower towards the ground until, eventually, they were lying down on the grass. ""All I wanted was a dance party,"" bassist Este Haim told the BBC afterwards, ""and then Glastonbury danced with me. We tangoed."" This video can not be played Haim reflect on their triumphant set Sunday also saw sets from Shaggy, Emeli Sande, London Grammar and Biffy Clyro, who threw down the gauntlet to Sheeran with a ferocious volley of rock riffs on the Pyramid Stage. There is no Glastonbury in 2018, meaning that there are 731 days until Worthy Farm opens its gates again. The cows will be pleased.

Trump gift leaves Australian PM bemused,"Repaired ties: Mr Turnbull and Mr Trump have reportedly put the past behind them Australian PM Malcolm Turnbull could only grin after receiving a cheeky gift of a pink tie emblazoned with the words ""Donald J Trump"". The official Trump-branded item was given to Mr Turnbull as part of a joke by Sydney's Coptic Orthodox church. His relationship with Mr Trump became a talking point after the US president was reported to have abruptly ended a phone call between the two in January. Mr Turnbull later disputed this and the pair are said to have repaired ties. The Australian prime minister smiled and posed with the silk necktie after receiving it from Grace Bishop Paula, from the Diocese of Tanta in Egypt, and Coptic Orthodox Bishop Daniel on Sunday. Mr Turnbull displays his Donald Trump-branded silk tie Ties between Australia and the US were briefly strained after the leaders'famously difficult first phone callover a refugee resettlement agreement, which was initially made by former US President Barack Obama. Mr Trump was said to have become irritated and broke off what was supposed to be an hour-long call after 25 minutes, later tweeting that the refugee deal was ""dumb"". Earlier this monthfootage leaked to the mediashowed Mr Turnbull poking fun at Mr Trump at a dinner for the media. But US and Australian brushed the incident off as harmless fun. Mr Turnbull said his impersonation had received ""mixed reviews"". ""Everyone says politicians are too serious, too scripted. You gotta lighten up right? It's Australia,"" he said.

Six hurt as car ploughs into Eid crowd,"This video can not be played ""Everybody was in a panic"" A woman has been bailed after six people, including three children, were injured when a car mounted a kerb and ploughed into a crowd of people. The crash happened outside Newcastle's Westgate Sports Centre where an Eid event was taking place. Northumbria Police said four people remained in hospital on Monday being treated for ""various injuries"". The force added that a 42-year-old woman has been released on conditional bail pending further investigation. The incident was not believed to be terrorism-related. Emergency services included six ambulances, two paramedic rapid response vehicles and the air ambulance Of the three children hospitalised, two were in intensive care. The woman who was arrested had been celebrating the end of Ramadan with her family and hundreds of others when the collision happened at 09:14 BST on Sunday. One eyewitness said: ""From what I understand [a woman who had been at prayer] was about to leave in her car and I believe she lost control. ""I ran up straight away because everyone was moving in on all the injured, trying to put water in their mouths. ""The parents of the kids were there. I had to sort of try and calm them down just to tell them the ambulance is there and they will take care of it; they know what they're doing."" Emergency services included six ambulances, two paramedic rapid response vehicles and the air ambulance. In a statement, the nearby Newcastle Central Mosque said: ""We pray and hope that all those affected recover soon fully. ""We thank the emergency medical services, the police and over 100 volunteers from the mosque for their quick response to the incident. ""We urge everyone to please pray for all those affected."" Chi Onwurah, Labour MP for Newcastle Central,tweeted,external: ""So sad, I was at the prayers earlier & there were so much joy & unity. Thinking of those affected by what I am told was terrible accident."" People at the scene created a human chain so emergency services could help the injured We were here for Eid. Everyone had just finished praying. The imam had finished his speech and everyone was talking to their families and getting some food. Then we heard a commotion and screaming. I ran up to the hill. A man got out of the passenger side. He seemed distraught. Someone was trapped under the car and then everyone just pushed the car so they were free. They were two children there, one of them - he was a boy about eight - was really badly injured, There were about five doctors there so he had a lot of medical attention. We checked to see he had a pulse. Everyone locked arms so there was a ring of locked arms around the injured people so they had space and the ambulances could get to them. Everyone was distraught. I am very grateful it's not an attack. It's very shocking to see a child injured like that. We are all hoping that he is fine, I just want to hear that. Abdul Mahdoul, who was at the event, said: ""We were wishing everyone happy Eid and suddenly we heard a lot of shouting and screaming. We didn't know what it was. ""People were panicking. The police did a great job to calm the situation down. ""It was a very happy atmosphere beforehand, but afterwards just chaos. I just wish for the people to recover very quickly."" Abdul Mahdoul said a ""very happy atmosphere"" turned into ""chaos"" Councillor Dipu Ahad said: ""We saw people crying and sobbing, it was like what you see in a horror movie, people were crying on the street, in corners. ""It was a real sad situation to see this and I think people were in confusion about what really happened. ""I had tears in my own eyes - it was a day of celebration for Muslims and others as well and it's a very sad situation and I hope this never happens again.""

Nazi camp survivor's grave found,"Frank Le Villio's occupation registration card shows he worked as a mechanic's apprentice The grave of a Nazi concentration camp survivor which was unmarked for decades has been discovered and had a cross with a plaque placed on it. Frank Le Villio was sent to World War Two Neuengamme and Sandbostel camps aged 19 after stealing a German officer's motorbike in occupied Jersey. He survived and moved to Nottingham, but died aged 21 from tuberculosis. A service, attended by members of his family and Nottingham's lord mayor, has been held at his grave to honour him. Members of Frank Le Villio's family at his grave A wooden cross and several wreaths were laid on the grave where Mr Le Villio, from Jersey, and six other people were buried. Mr Le Villio's cousin Stanley Hockley, from Jersey, was at the service at Wilford Hill Cemetery, Nottingham. He said: ""It has been absolutely wonderful finding his grave after 70 odd years. ""We did not know where he was buried to start with. We always thought about him."" He said the family was hoping to take him back to Jersey. Mr Le Villio had developed tuberculosis while in the camps and was being treated at Nottingham's City Hospital when he died in 1946. Mr Le Villio is believed to be one of the few camp survivors from Jersey who was able to return to the UK after the war. He had developed tuberculosis while in the camps and was being treated at Nottingham's City Hospital when he died in 1946. His grave was discovered earlier this year afteran appeal,externalby Devon-based Stanley Keiller, who came across Mr Le Villio's story and realised his grave's whereabouts was unknown when doing his own family history research. Mr Keiller also attended the ceremony. Father Derek Hailes, who answered Mr Keiller's appeal in the Nottingham Post Mr Keiller's appeal was answered by Father Derek Hailes, of St Cyprian's Church, in Nottingham, who tracked down the pauper's grave a few months ago with the help of undertaker A. W. Lymn and church officials. Father Hailes said he was very pleased to help track down the grave and said the service was ""closure"" for the family.

The Hollywood stars who quit acting,"Daniel Day-Lewis surprised Hollywood this week byannouncing his retirementfrom acting. Although he still has one film due to be released later this year - Phantom Thread, based on the fashion world of 1950s London - after he finishes its promotion he ""will no longer be working as an actor"". Whether he can be tempted back out of retirement remains to be seen, but here are nine other stars who have quit the profession. You might not have realised, but Cameron Diaz hasn't been in a film since 2014's Annie, nor does she have any films in the pipeline. She recently explained why she stepped out of the spotlight at an event run by her best mate, Gwyneth Paltrow. ""I just went, 'I can't really say who I am to myself.' Which is a hard thing to face up to. I felt the need to make myself whole,""she said at a Goop Wellness Summit,external. In the years since, she has married Good Charlotte singer Benji Madden and published two books - The Body Book, a health and fitness manual, and The Longevity Book, about the art and science of growing older. Once voted the sexiest man of the 20th Century, James Bond star Sir Sean Connery quit acting after filming The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen in 2003. He didn't officiallyconfirm his retirement,externaluntil he received the American Film Institute's lifetime achievement award in 2006. Althoughaccording to his friend,externalSir Michael Caine, it was the movie business that retired the Bond star ""because he didn't want to play small parts about old men and they weren't offering him any young parts in romantic leads"". Sir Sean has since been enjoying retirement, spending his days playing golf and has been spotted at the odd tennis tournament. Canadian actor Rick Moranis rose up Hollywood's ranks after appearing in hit films such as Ghostbusters, Spaceballs, Little Shop of Horrors and Honey, I Shrunk the Kids. However he began scaling back his acting work after his wife died of cancer in 1991 and retired from on-screen work completely in 1997 to concentrate on raising his children. ""I'm a single parent, and I just found that it was too difficult to manage raising my kids and doing the travelling involved in making movies,""he told USA Today,externalin 2005. ""So I took a little bit of a break. And the little bit of a break turned into a longer break, and then I found that I really didn't miss it."" One of the most famous child actors, Shirley Temple was awarded a special juvenile Oscar in 1935 for her contribution to film that year when she was just seven years old. But as she grew older her appeal declined and she retired from acting in 1950 at the grand old age of 22. She returned to the spotlight in the late 1960s as a politician and diplomat, and became the US ambassador to Czechoslovakia in 1989. She continued to work in public service including for the United Nations untilshe died in 2014aged 85. As King Joffrey on hit TV show Game of Thrones,(SPOILER ALERT)Jack Gleeson played one of the most hated characters on TV for three years, but when his character was killed off in season three, the star decided to kill off his acting career too. ""I've been acting since age eight,""he told Entertainment Weekly,external. ""I just stopped enjoying it as much as I used to... whereas up until now it was always something I did for recreation with my friends, or in the summer for some fun - I enjoyed it. ""When you make a living from something, it changes your relationship with it. It's not like I hate it, it's just not what I want to do."" Gleeson went on to study philosophy and theology at Dublin's Trinity College, although he dipped a toe back into performing when he took a puppet show, called Bears in Space, to the Edinburgh Fringe in 2014 and London's Soho Theatre in 2015. Amanda Bynes hit the big time in her teens when she scored her own programme - The Amanda Show - on Nickelodeon. A string of teen films followed which you may have seen more than once or twice on TV recently - What a Girl Wants (2003), where she finds out her dad is Colin Firth who is trying to become prime minister; She's the Man (2006), a modern take on Shakespeare's Twelfth Night; and the big-screen adaptation of the musical Hairspray. Once touted as a young Lucille Ball, her last film role was in 2010 - the same year she tweeted: ""If I don't love something anymore I stop doing it. I don't love acting anymore so I've stopped doing it."" In the years since, she's had more than one brush with the law for drunk driving and substance abuse, but the actress - who is now 31 - recentlygave an interview,externalsaying she was now three years sober and wanted to start acting again. ""I want to be alone,"" Greta Garbo was famed for saying - and in the end, she really meant it. The actress was one of Hollywood's most enigmatic stars in the 1930s. Desperate for privacy, she never gave any interviews, signed autographs or attended premieres - much to the frustration of the press. She retired from acting when she was 36, saying she was ""tired of Hollywood"" and ""wanted to live another life"". But her early retirement and subsequent reclusiveness meant she remained eternally young on screen and in people's minds. After a five-decade career and Oscar wins in 1971 for The French Connection and 1992 for Unforgiven, Gene Hackman told veteran US TV host Larry King in 2004 he was retiring. Four years later in aninterview with Reuters,externalhe said although he missed acting, he didn't want to do it any longer. ""The business for me is very stressful. The compromises that you have to make in films are just part of the beast, and it had gotten to a point where I just didn't feel like I wanted to do it anymore,"" he said. Since he retired, he's written three novels. Doris Day was one of the biggest stars by the 1960s thanks to her double singing and acting career, in films such as Calamity Jane, Pillow Talk and Move Over, Darling. Her last film was in 1968 and after a brief stint on TV, announced she was retiring from acting in 1975. Now 95, she has since dedicated her life to working as an animal welfare advocate, and set up the Doris Day Animal Foundation in 1978.

More high-rises fail fire safety tests,"Cladding on 60 high-rise buildings across 25 local authority areas in England has failed fire safety tests, the government has said. There are plans to test the fire resistance of cladding on up to 600 buildings following the Grenfell Tower fire in North Kensington on 14 June. The Department for Communities and Local Government said all buildings examined so far had failed the test. Councils were told to prioritise buildings they had most concern over. Not all the buildings affected have so far been named but a list from the DCLG identifies14 of the areas: Camden - five buildings Brent - one Barnet - three Hounslow - one Islington - one Lambeth - one Wandsworth - two Manchester - four Norwich - one Plymouth - three Portsmouth - two Doncaster - one Sunderland - five Stockton-on-Tees - three Separately, cladding is to beremoved from nine tower blocksin Salford, whileBootle said two buildingshad cladding that failed tests. The update came asCamden Council said it had told about 200 residents still refusing to vacatefour of its tower blocks on the Chalcots estate that they ""must leave"" to allow improvement works to go ahead. The majority of the residents were evacuated on Friday night. Where have fire cladding tests failed? Six questions for the Grenfell investigation Confusion and anger after evacuation Grenfell Tower fire began in fridge-freezer Firefighters had said they could not guarantee the safety of the buildings, which has cladding similar to Grenfell Tower where the fire is feared to have killed 79 people. Camden Council leader Georgia Gould said officials would be visiting the residents still in their homes and continue to arrange temporary accommodation in hotels and other council properties. She said there were ""various legal routes that Camden Council could explore. However, we really don't want to do this"". She said: ""Most of the residents are willing to go, they are just waiting for the right accommodation. They're scared, they want to be sure that they can come back... the right approach is to work with them."" Residents were told to leave four of the Chalcots Estate's blocks on Friday Chalcots was refurbished between 2006 and 2009 by the same firm, Rydon, that oversaw work at Grenfell Tower in 2015-16. The government testing programme began on 21 June, with local authorities asked to submit cladding for examination. This video can not be played Mohammed Iskander shows us around the evacuation centre in Swiss Cottage Speaking on BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend, Lord Kerslake, the former head of the civil service who who now chairs the Peabody housing association in London, called for the testing process to be accelerated. ""We are told they can do 100 a day - that should be the number they are meeting,"" he said. He added: ""This is clearly a terrible national disaster and demands a national response. As well as the public inquiry on the lessons learned we need to establish where the areas of the highest risk are and take action immediately. That's been a priority for me."" The Local Government Association said some councils have introduced 24-hour warden patrols to mitigate the risk before cladding is removed. It said in a statement: ""Where cladding fails the test, this will not necessarily mean moving residents from tower blocks. ""In Camden, the decision to evacuate was based on fire inspectors' concerns about a combination of other fire hazards together with the cladding."" The LGA said it was advising councils still waiting for test results to prepare contingency plans ""so they can take any measures needed quickly"".

Barry Gibb brings Glastonbury to its feet,"We're calling it: Islands In The Stream has become the unofficial anthem of Glastonbury. Kenny Rogers debuted the song in 2013; and Dolly Parton featured it in her record-breaking set a year later. Now Barry Gibb, who wrote the song, has made it the centrepiece of his performance at the festival's coveted ""legend slot"". It was one of a dozen or more classics from his, and the Bee Gees', catalogue that made it impossible to stand still. There was a sense of euphoria as he ran through the likes of Tragedy, Jive Talkin' and Night Fever, his falsetto never wavering in the bright afternoon sun. The Bee Gee attracted one of the biggest audiences of the weekend As has now become tradition in the legend slot, Glastonbury's security team joined the performance, with a choreographed routine to Stayin' Alive that brought a huge smile to Gibb's face. BBC Glastonbury - watch and listen to the festival live Katy Perry crowdsurfs and Craig David triumphs Dizzee: 'I should headline Glastonbury' The cheapest pint at Glastonbury Get to know Glastonbury's headliners His triumphant set came a year after Gibb joined Coldplay on the Pyramid Stage for two Bee Gee covers: To Love Somebody and what Chris Martin called ""the greatest song of all time"", Stayin' Alive. Gibb had been meant to play the festival that year, but pulled out when a family member fell ill. The star recently revealed he struggled with appearing on stage by himself, following the death of his brothers Maurice and Robin. ""I don't like being on stage on my own. I miss my brothers. I get nerves being on stage on my own because it is so new to me,""he told the Sunday Mirror,external. ""We would all lean on each other. I'd lean on Maurice and Robin and they would lean on me and somehow we'd get through every show. ""We knew how each other felt. I knew what their opinions were. We were three brothers and it was a democracy. ""We were three brothers who had to agree. If one of them did not like something we did not do it."" This video can not be played Barry Gibb's golden Glastonbury gift Gibb beamed a picture of his brothers onto the stage as he performed Nights on Broadway, eliciting a swell of support from the audience. Several were wearing Barry Gibb masks and one fan passed a gold jacket up to the stage, which Gibb gamely wore for the last 15 minutes of his 75-minute set. By that point, the crowd was chanting his name -  ""Barry! Barry! Barry!"" - between songs and the star, who is more than 50 years into his career, was visibly touched by their enthusiasm. ""You guys have been the best. Thank you for the experience of a lifetime,"" he said. ""I hope to see you again."" This video can not be played Nile Rodgers: 'Lady Gaga gave me those shoes'. Gibb was followed onto the Pyramid stage by fellow disco legends Chic. If anything, they drew a larger crowd than Gibb. The hills were full to bursting with flag-waving fans as Nile Rodgers served up a feast of funk. The set spanned his entire career as a producer and writer, with Chic's Le Freak joined by Sister Sledge's We Are Family and the Diana Ross classic Upside Down. Rodgers even threw in Daft Punk's Get Lucky (on which he played guitar) and a verse of The Sugar Hill Gang's Rappers' Delight - which sampled Chic's Good Times - for good measure.

Farron: 'End pay cap' for emergency staff,"Police have been stretched by attacks in London and Manchester The public sector pay cap should be scrapped in recognition of the work of the emergency services following recent disasters, says Tim Farron. The outgoing Lib Dem leader said firefighters, police and medical staff ""deserve so much better"". The pay cap, which has been in place since 2012, limits pay rises for public sector workers to 1% a year until 2020. Ministers have said that wage restraint in the public sector helps protect jobs and repairs the public finances. Grenfell Tower: Praise for 'heroic' firefighters UK terror attacks: Home secretary says police stretched Heroic public sector staff deserve more pay - Hunt But Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said earlier this month he had ""a great deal of sympathy"" for the case made by nurses for an end to the pay cap because of the ""enormous amount of goodwill and time given free of charge"" by staff. Labour and the Lib Dems both pledged to scrap the 1% pay cap in their 2017 manifestos. In the past few months there have been terror attacks in London and Manchester, and the Grenfell Tower fire disaster. Mr Farron said the pay cap should be replaced by pay rises in line with inflation. His party says the cap means that emergency service staff are seeing their wages cut in real terms, with the average firefighter set to be an estimated Â£1,423 a year worse off, in real terms, by 2020-21. Mr Farron said: ""Terror attacks in London and Manchester and the Grenfell Tower tragedy have reminded us how our emergency services deal with the most terrible of events with professionalism and courage. They deserve a pay rise, not a pay cut. ""This is about choices. During the election campaign, Theresa May reacted with indifference when asked why nurses were having to resort to using food banks. ""But in recent months we have seen time and again that our emergency services run towards danger when others run away. They deserve so much better. ""The Liberal Democrats call on the government to stand up for our firefighters, police, doctors and nurses and give them the pay rise they deserve."" Home Secretary Amber Rudd admitted last week that terror attacks in the past three months had left police resources ""pulled very tight"". A Treasury spokesperson said: ""The whole country truly values the extraordinary professionalism and courage that the police and the emergency services have shown in recent weeks and it is crucial that the public sector continues to recruit, retain and motivate the highest quality staff. ""Pay restraint is one of the many difficult choices the government has had to make to protect jobs while helping to put the UK's public finances back on track. ""The independent Office for Budget Responsibility estimates that our current pay policy will protect 200,000 public sector jobs.""

Italy forced to bail out two more banks,"Intesa Sanpaolo will take on the two failing banks' good assets Italy's government is bailing out two banks in the Venice region at a cost of 5.2bn euros (Â£4.6bn; $5.8bn). The move comes two days after the European Central Bank warned that Banca Popolare di Vicenza and Veneto Banca were failing or likely to fail. The banks' ""good"" assets will be taken on by Intesa Sanpaolo banking group. Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni said the rescue was needed to protect savers and ensure ""the good health of our banking system"". The two banks' branches and employees will be part of Intesa by Monday morning in a move designed to avoid a potential run on deposits that could have spread to other Italian banks. Economy Minister Pier Carlo Padoan said Rome would also offer guarantees of up to 12bn euros for potential losses to Intesa from bad and risky loans. ""Those who criticise us should say what a better alternative would have been. I can't see it,"" he told a press conference on Sunday. Rome's plan has been approved by the European Commission and avoids a bailout under potentially tougher European rules. The EC's competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager, said allowing Italy to use state aid would ""avoid an economic disturbance in the Veneto region"". She added: ""These measures will also remove 18bn euros in non-performing loans from the Italian banking sector and contribute to its consolidation."" Intesa, Italy's biggest retail bank, has paid a symbolic one euro for the two banks' good assets. ""Without Intesa Sanpaolo's offer - the only significant one submitted at the auction held by the government - the crisis of the two banks would have had a serious impact on the whole Italian banking system,"" financial analysts at Messina said. The failure of the two Venetian banks could result in as many as 4,000 job losses, La Repubblica newspaper reported. Sunday's rescue is the latest twist in the drive to fix the Italian banking system, which is saddled with bad loans worth about 350bn euros - a third of the eurozone's total bad debt. In early June the European Commission and the Italian government agreed a state bailout for Monte dei Paschi di Siena (MPS) that included big cost cuts, losses for some investors and a pay cap for its top executives. The agreement followed months of talks over the fate of the world's oldest bank and Italy's fourth-biggest lender - the worst performer in last year's European stress tests. Monte dei Paschi was forced to ask for state aid in December 2016 to help cover a capital shortfall of 8.8bn euros after investors declined to put more funds into the troubled bank. The same month Mr Gentiloni said his government hadset up a 20bn euro fund - largely to bail out MPS. Sunday's announcement comes less than a month afterSpain's Banco Popular was rescued by Santander. The European Central Bank said Banco Popular was ""failing or likely to fail"" due to its dwindling cash reserves. The bank has struggled after billions in property investments turned sour. The rescue will cost Santander about 7bn euros (Â£6.1bn).

Crowded boat sinks on Colombia reservoir,"This video can not be played The moment the Colombia passenger boat sank (Parts of this video have been sped up) Seven people have died after a passenger boat sank on a reservoir in north-western Colombia, officials say. They say that 158 people were rescued, but two are still missing after the four-deck Almirante went down near the popular resort town of GuatapÃ©. There were about 170 people on board. Witness Juan Quiroz told the BBC the boat sank in less than five minutes. Leisure boats quickly came to the rescue, hauling victims from the water and the top deck of the vessel. Some survivors complained that they had not been given life jackets. Army helicopters and divers later joined the search-and-rescue operation. Eyewitness Louisa Murphy told the BBC: ""We saw things flying off the side of the boat. And within, I think, probably about 20 seconds the boat had sort of sunk with just the top deck visible."" One of the survivors, Juliana BarragÃ¡n, was celebrating her 15th birthday on board with her three aunts. Two of them are among the dead, and another remains missing. Her father Jorge BarragÃ¡n, the victims' brother, told local reporters that Juliana was in shock. Those rescued were traumatised by the ordeal The search operation continues the hunt for survivors President Santos arrived in GuatapÃ© to personally assess the situation Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos, who travelled to the scene on Sunday evening, said the boat had capacity for the numbers on board, ruling out overcrowding as a reason for the accident. Local residents said that the vessel had sunk before - without people on board - but had then been repaired before being used again. Representatives from the boat company - Asobarcos - said they will not give any immediate statements and that everything will be resolved by their lawyer, according to El Tiempo newspaper.

Montreal festival float causes race row,"This video can not be played The float at Montreal's FÃªte Nationale parade A video from a Montreal festival parade has gone viral with critics suggesting it shows the event's lack of diversity. The clip shows a singer on a float pushed by four black men in khakis, as a white crowd dances around them in the Canadian city. The videouploaded on Facebook,externalwas captioned (in French): ""I'm not sure the organisers of the parade understood the concept of diversity."" The organisers called the outcry ""unjust"" and ""exaggerated"". Saint Jean Baptiste Day, known as FÃªte Nationale or National Holiday, is marked throughout the Quebec province every 24 June, as a celebration of Francophone history and culture. The Montreal event was themed on Quebec's history. Maxime Laporte, president of the SociÃ©tÃ© de St-Jean Baptiste de MontrÃ©al, told the CBC news network that it was a coincidence black men were pushing the float. You might also be interested in: Why so few women headline music festivals Racial 'disparity' in police respect Is everyone racist? The volunteers had been recruited from two local organisations: the Association for School Retention and the the Louis-Joseph-Papineau High School Sports Team. ""We need to look at this situation as a whole,"" Mr Laporte said. ""It was a wonderful parade that represented [Montreal's] diversity. People need to make a better judgment call in these circumstances."" Local resident FÃ©lix Brouillet shot the video, which has been shared more than 12,000 times, attracting many outraged comments. The Association of Muslims and Arabs for Secularism in Quebec also complained that it saw only black people - plus a couple of Asians and Arabs - pushing the floats. ""What do we say to the black child who is happy to go and celebrate the national holiday?""it asked on Facebook,external. However, school football coach Steve Lubin, who knows some of the students participating parade, told CBC he thought the issue was overblown. ""When kids work hard, I don't see colour. I see participants. It just so happens that my kids were working hard and that white people happened to be sitting on the float. If it was the opposite, would we be having this discussion? I'm not so sure."" Instatement on the festival's Facebook page,external, the organisers said the parade's eco-friendly vehicles were not motorised and so had to be pushed along. ""It goes without saying that these young people - who were proud to participate in the event - were not chosen according to the colour of their skin,"" it said.

Tourist boat sinks on Colombia reservoir,"This video can not be played The moment the Colombia passenger boat sank (Parts of this video have been sped up) Seven people have died after a passenger boat sank on a reservoir in north-western Colombia, officials say. They say that 158 people were rescued, but two are still missing after the four-deck Almirante went down near the popular resort town of GuatapÃ©. There were about 170 people on board. Witness Juan Quiroz told the BBC the boat sank in less than five minutes. Leisure boats quickly came to the rescue, hauling victims from the water and the top deck of the vessel. Some survivors complained that they had not been given life jackets. Army helicopters and divers later joined the search-and-rescue operation. Eyewitness Louisa Murphy told the BBC: ""We saw things flying off the side of the boat. And within, I think, probably about 20 seconds the boat had sort of sunk with just the top deck visible."" One of the survivors, Juliana BarragÃ¡n, was celebrating her 15th birthday on board with her three aunts. Two of them are among the dead, and another remains missing. Her father Jorge BarragÃ¡n, the victims' brother, told local reporters that Juliana was in shock. Those rescued were traumatised by the ordeal The search operation continues the hunt for survivors President Santos arrived in GuatapÃ© to personally assess the situation Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos, who travelled to the scene on Sunday evening, said the boat had capacity for the numbers on board, ruling out overcrowding as a reason for the accident. Local residents said that the vessel had sunk before - without people on board - but had then been repaired before being used again. Representatives from the boat company - Asobarcos - said they will not give any immediate statements and that everything will be resolved by their lawyer, according to El Tiempo newspaper. GuatapÃ© is a popular Andean resort town, known for its water sports and recreational activities.

Wonder Woman smashes box office records,"Gal Gadot takes the leading role in Patty Jenkins' film Patty Jenkins' Wonder Woman film is on track to break box office records by becoming the top grossing live-action film from a female director. The film has generated more than $620m worldwide since its launch 21 days ago, media reports say, and is on course to outperform the $665.7m made by Kung Fu Panda 2 - also directed by a woman. Some analysts predict Wonder Woman will also overtake Frozen, made in 2013 by male and female directors. It generated $1.28bn in ticket sales. Ms Jenkins' Wonder Woman is due to generate $319m (Â£250m; â¬285m) in the US in 24 days,Forbes' Scott Mendelson reports,external, which is only a little less than the $325m and $330m US totals of Suicide Squad and Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. Israeli actress Gal Gadot has also starred in the Fast & Furious films Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman salary seems low compared to male actors Wonder Woman's female director conquers box office Does Wonder Woman live up to the hype? Wonder Woman is soon likely to be the biggest US success for DC Comics, apart from the last two Batman Dark Knight sequels. The film - starring Israeli actress Gal Gadot in the lead role - has already overtaken the international ticket sales of Phyllida Lloyd's Mamma Mia!, which earned $609m in 2008, Mendelson says. ""[The] action spectacular is still doing ridiculously well, both in terms of raw numbers and legs,"" he writes. ""Its projected $27.5m fourth weekend is a drop of just 33% from last weekend, which is nuts for a movie like this."" Wonder Woman is also due to secure ""the seventh-biggest fourth weekend gross of all time"", he adds. Wonder Woman is the first female-led superhero film to be directed by a woman. It has received largely positive reviews from film critics. Hollywood is known for its reluctance to hire female directors, especially for blockbuster superhero movies.

Stella McCartney proud of her dad's song,"Fashion designer Stella McCartney has chosen her dad's song Blackbird as one of her records for Desert Island Discs. She said she found it ""incredible how contemporary the song feels"" and  was ""proud"" of former Beatle Sir Paul McCartney for writing it. Stellatold the BBC Radio 4 showthat music had been ""the driving force in every moment of our childhood"". For her book choice, she also chose Sir Paul's memoir Japanese Jailbird, written by him but never released. The manuscript - detailing what happened in 1980 when the star spent nine days in a Japanese jail for a drugs offence - has been locked away for decades with the only copies given to his children, something that Stella said she finds ""very beautiful"". She went on: ""I just think it makes me remember family and it would make me also remember freedom."" The 45-year-old also praised the late David Bowie after choosing his song Starman as one of her tracks. ""What an amazing talent and again so modern, so relevant and so individual. What an incredible, individual voice he had,"" she said. Stella McCartney, right, alongside her father Paul and sister Mary in 2009 Speaking about Blackbird - on the 1968 album The Beatles - Stella said the track had ""never aged"", which she described as shocking. ""I'm really proud of dad that he wrote it at such a young age, he had this sort of incredible vision to understand politics, to understand poetry,"" she added. She recalled how music was a huge influence on her childhood and her father would come home every day from the studio and she would listen to what he had created. Stella spoke of meeting many famous faces from the music world, such as Quincy Jones and Michael Jackson, who all had ""an incredible influence"" on her. The designer told the programme she often used the name Stella Martin while at school and studying at London's Central Saint Martins college to avoid being recognised. Her final year show in college hit the headlines after famous faces such as Kate Moss, Naomi Campbell and Yasmin Le Bon wore her designs on the catwalk. Kate Moss, right, took part in Stella McCartney's, left, fashion show at college ""I look back on that moment and just feel a bit embarrassed that I was so naive,"" she said. The designer went on to defend some of the expensive price tags on items in her fashion range. When asked about the ""ethics"" and ""morals"" of someone paying thousands for a dress, she said: ""Look at some of my competitors and that's probably fairly well-priced. ""I mean, I do struggle with that concept, but I work really hard to have a lot of products that are available on a better price point.""

Davis 'pretty sure' of free trade deal,"This video can not be played ""Very French"": What David Davis thinks of his EU counterpart Brexit Secretary David Davis has told the BBC he is ""pretty sure"", but not ""certain"", that he will be able to get a free trade deal with the EU. He told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show that other EU states ""have a very strong interest in getting a good deal"". But he said that if the UK was only offered a ""punishment deal"" then it had to be prepared to ""walk away"". His Labour shadow Sir Keir Starmer said Mr Davis should focus on getting the best deal, not ""preparing for failure"". Next boss calls for 'smooth' Brexit Archbishop: Draw the poison from Brexit Post Brexit deals 'for poorest countries' Brexit: All you need to know In his interview, Mr Davis also defended Theresa May as a ""very good prime minister"" - although said she was ""under pressure"". When asked if it would be ""catastrophic"" for Brexit negotiations for there to be a Tory leadership contest, he replied: ""Yes."" ""Let me be absolutely plain about this, number one, I happen to think we have got a very good prime minister. I know she is coming under a lot of pressure at the moment, but I have seen her in action. ""I think she is very good. She makes good decisions. She's bold. She takes her time. ""Point number two is, I want a stable backdrop to this Brexit negotiation."" Mr Davis is heading up the UK side of negotiations, and began talks last week with his EU counterpart Michel Barnier. Of Mr Barnier, he said: ""He wants a deal as much as we want a deal, I think."" Mrs May has been criticised by some for saying ""no deal is better than a bad deal"" with the EU. Mrs May has been under pressure since losing her Commons majority in the general election Last week, Chancellor Philip Hammond said ""no deal would be a very, very bad outcome for Britain"" although he went on to say a ""worse outcome"" would be a deal ""deliberately structured to suck the lifeblood out of our economy"". When Mr Davis was asked by Marr whether he was sure there would be a deal, he said: ""I'm pretty sure, I am not 100% sure, you can never be, it's a negotiation. Reminded of his past words that ""we are guaranteed to get a deal"", Mr Davis said: ""You can be sure there will be a deal, whether it's the deal I want which is the free trade agreement, the customs agreement and so on - I'm pretty sure but I'm not certain."" On the prospect of no deal, he said a bad deal ""would be better than a punishment deal"". ""We cannot have a circumstance where the other side says that they are going to punish you. So if that happens then there is a walkaway, and we have to plan for that."" Mr Davis and EU chief negotiator Mr Barnier began talks last week Mr Davis said he wanted to deliver an outcome ""which helps both sides"" and said it was likely there would be a transitional period, after the UK leaves the EU, for trade arrangements, probably of ""one to two years"". Sir Keir Starmer, shadow secretary of state for exiting the EU, said ""no deal is not a viable option as it would be catastrophic for British trade, jobs and security. The sooner David Davis realises this, the better. ""Instead of preparing for failure the government should be putting all their efforts into getting a Brexit deal that works for Britain - that means putting jobs and the economy first and dropping the no deal mantra."" Mr Davis also said he wanted to get a deal on the rights of EU citizens in the UK, and UK citizens living in other EU states, ""through now"" and to discuss the issue of how the border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic will operate, although he acknowledged that it would not be concluded in the negotiations this summer. He said the government wanted to have an ""invisible border"" between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic and said there was lots of ""technical stuff"" to start working on now - such as number plate recognition and ""trusted trailer schemes"". But the Liberal Democrats' Brexit spokesman, Tom Brake, said Mr Davis ""inspires about as much confidence as a drunken trapeze artist"". ""It is the country as a whole that will suffer when he comes crashing to the floor. ""These negotiations will affect our lives for decades, but he's only 'pretty sure' of getting a deal. It is simply not good enough."" Meanwhile Shadow Cabinet Office minister Jon Trickett has been asked to clarify Labour's position on the single market after 50 Labour politicianssigned a letter to the Guardian,externalurging the party to back staying in. Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell has previously said he did not think remaining a member of the single market was ""feasible"" and Mr Corbyn has suggested Brexit would mean an end to the UK's single market membership. Mr Trickett told BBC One's Sunday Politics that while Labour's position is to ""have access to all of the tariff-free arrangements which exist within the customs union and single market"" it was not wedded to any ""particular institutional form"". He said: ""We are pragmatic about it. Let's see how the negotiations go. We are not going to say one thing or another in terms of institutional relationships."" The prime minister has said the UK ""cannot possibly"" remain in the single market as to do so would mean ""not leaving the EU at all"". EU leaders have warned that the UK cannot access the single market, which allows the free movement of goods, services and workers between its members, while at the same time restricting the free movement of people.

Seven killed in Kashmir cable car crash,"The cable cars at Gulmarg offer spectacular views of the Himalayas At least seven people have been killed in Indian-administered Kashmir when the wire supporting a cable car snapped in the high-altitude tourist resort of Gulmarg, officials say. The cable car was sent crashing to the ground, killing everyone in it. Scores of people are reported to be trapped in other cable cars amid high winds. A rescue operation continues. The cable is reported to have snapped after a tree was blown over in the gales. The dead include two children. The cable-cars at Gulmarg are among the highest in the world. Officials say they are working hard to repair the damaged cable and get people stranded in 15 other cable cars safely back to ground. Former Chief Minister Omar Abdullah  alleged ""carelessness"" by the authorities. ""If this is what happened it begs the question as to why the cable car operations weren't suspended in high winds. That is a laid-down SOP [standard operating procedure],""he tweeted,externalsoon after the accident. The cable cars at Gulmarg transport passengers to a height of 4,100m (13,450ft) and provide scenic views of the Himalayas which remain snow-capped even at this time of the year.

Harry 'wanted out' of Royal Family,"Prince Harry was once so disillusioned with being part of the Royal Family that he decided he ""wanted out"". Having considered giving up his title, he finally decided he should remain and ""work out a role for myself"". Speaking to the Mail on Sunday,,externalthe prince - who is fifth in line to the throne - said being in the Army was ""the best escape I've ever had"". And he said the royals ""don't want to be just a bunch of celebrities but instead use our role for good"". Harry, 32, spent 10 years in the Army,serving twice in Afghanistan. He had to leave when his presence there was revealed by the media in 2008. ""I felt very resentful. Being in the Army was the best escape I've ever had. I felt as though I was really achieving something. ""I have a deep understanding of all sorts of people from different backgrounds and felt I was part of a team."" Prince Harry: No-one wants to be king He has since been closely involved with charity work, including supporting wounded veterans and mental health groups.

RBS to move hundreds of jobs to India,"Royal Bank of Scotland is cutting 443 UK jobs dealing with business loans as it shifts many of the roles to India. The state-owned bank said it was moving the jobs, which help to handle loans for small businesses, as part of an ongoing cost-cutting drive. But the company, which owns RBS and NatWest, added that UK staff would still deal with customers and take the decisions on whether to grant loans. The Unite union said UK workers and taxpayers would lose out from the move. ""By shipping these jobs to India, RBS will be getting that work done more cheaply at the cost of jobs and livelihoods here in the UK,"" a spokesman said. The bank's small business customers will also be unsettled by the decision, according to Mike Cherry, chairman of the Federal of Small Businesses. ""Many small business customers with RBS will be extremely concerned at the idea of local expert staff being sent packing and their roles outsourced to call centres halfway round the world,"" Mr Cherry said. He added it was the ""wrong way to rebuild trust"" after branch closures and a mis-selling scandal that saw thousands of small business customerscompensated by the bank last year. The company, which is still 73% owned by the government after a Â£45bn bailout in 2008, said staff in Mumbai would take over back-office roles such as background checks. But it added that UK-based staff would continue to do the work that involved customer contact. Credit decisions will also be taken in the UK, according to the bank. by Joe Lynam, business correspondent, BBC News If you've just agreed a new mortgage or remortgaged, you'll probably not have met the person who decided to give it to you (or not). That's not the case with small companies. They have a far closer relationship with their bank manager. The latter needs to know what kind of business you have and how you run it. Some may have fretted that shifting more than 400 jobs relating to SME (small and medium-sized enterprises) lending to India might irrevocably alter than relationship. And that's why RBS is stressing that all credit decisions will continue to be taken here in Britain and no relationship managers with SMEs will be downsized. RBS doesn't want to damage its current position as the largest business bank in the UK. A spokesman for the RBS group said: ""As we become a simpler, smaller bank, we are making some changes to the way we serve our customers. ""Unfortunately, these changes will result in the net reduction of 443 roles in the UK."" The company said it would support staff affected by the ""disappointing news"", including by moving them into new roles where possible. It comes just weeks after RBS said it wouldcut 250 IT jobsin the UK and move dozens of the roles to India.

London tower block residents 'must leave',"This video can not be played Mohammed Iskander shows us around the evacuation centre in Swiss Cottage Residents refusing to vacate four north London tower blocks over fire safety fears are being told they ""must leave"". Camden Council said its staff would continue asking those people who had not yet left the Chalcots Estate in Swiss Cottage to move from their flats. About 200 people are refusing to move to temporary accommodation. Cladding on 34 tower blocks in 17 council areas in England has failed government fire safety tests - every sample submitted so far. The government plans to examine cladding from up to 600 buildings and Lord Kerslake, the former head of the civil service who who now chairs the Peabody housing association in London, has called for the testing process to be accelerated. Where have fire cladding tests failed? ""We are told they can do 100 a day - that should be the number they are meeting,"" he told The World This Weekend on BBC Radio 4. He added: ""This is clearly a terrible national disaster and demands a national response... As well as the public inquiry on the lessons learned we need to establish where the areas of the highest risk are and take action immediately. That's been a priority for me."" The Department for Communities and Local Government testing programme began on Wednesday. Although every sample has failed to date, the DCLG pointed out that local authorities have been asked to prioritise buildings they had most concern over. This video can not be played Watch: Meet Rosie, who refused to leave Taplow Tower in Camden Meanwhile, the leader of Camden Council, Georgia Gould, said residents will have to stay at a nearby leisure centre for a third night. She said the council had found accommodation for many families but some people who have been staying with friends and family are now asking for hotels. Officials would again visit residents still in their homes as they needed to leave the blocks before work on making the buildings safe could begin, she added. Ms Gould said: ""We have also dispatched social workers to have conversations with those families, those individuals, about what will help them move out."" She said some of the residents want to leave but are refusing to spend the night in the council rest centre. Some people have issues, including agoraphobia and needing medication, and want to be sure they have got suitable accommodation before moving out of their flats. Ms Gould said earlier there were ""various legal routes that Camden Council could explore. However, we really don't want to do this"". She later added: ""If it comes to the point where people really, really won't leave that is absolutely the last resort. The last thing I want to do is force people out of their homes, and the conversations I have been having with residents in these buildings is that they are willing to work with us."" Residents were told to leave four of the Chalcots Estate's blocks on Friday Four of the five blocks on the Chalcots Estate were evacuated on Friday due to concerns about external cladding, gas pipe insulation, and fire doors. Camden Council said it had no option but to move residents from 650 flats while work takes place. But - across the country - not every block that fails safety tests will be evacuated. Communities Secretary Sajid Javid - while agreeing with the decision in Camden - said: ""A failure in testing of the cladding does not necessarily mean that a building will have to be evacuated. ""The decision by Camden Council was because the failed testing of the external cladding was compounded by multiple other fire safety failures."" The Local Government Association said some councils have introduced 24-hour warden patrols to mitigate the risk before cladding is removed. It said in a statement: ""For those areas still waiting for results of tests on aluminium composite material cladding, our advice to them is to prepare contingency plans so they can take any measures needed quickly."" Some of the local authorities where high-rise buildings have failed fire safety tests have been named. They include: Camden - where residents have been evacuated from four blocks on the Chalcots Estate Brent - where a housing association tower block, Elizabeth House, has cladding but London Fire Brigade advises it is not a risk Barnet - where cladding put up on three towers in Granville Road, NW2, in 2012 is to be removed as precautionary measure Hounslow - where Clements Court tower in Cranford is to have outer cladding removed Manchester - where 78 panels are being removed from one area of the Village 135 development in Wythenshawe Salford - where cladding is also to beremoved from nine tower blocks Bootle - where cladding is being removed from Cygnet House and Wren House in St James Drive Plymouth - where three blocks on theMount Wise Tower estatewere found to have cladding made from similar material to Grenfell Tower Portsmouth - where the city council is removing cladding fromHoratia House and Leamington House in Somerstown The Chalcots Estate's cladding is similar to Grenfell Tower in North Kensington, west London, where a fire is feared to have killed 79 people. Chalcots was refurbished between 2006 and 2009 by the same firm, Rydon, that oversaw work at Grenfell Tower in 2015-16. One flat destroyed in London fire Confusion and anger after evacuation Grenfell Tower fire began in fridge-freezer After the evacuation, emergency accommodation was set up at Swiss Cottage leisure centre and at the Camden Centre in King's Cross. Camden Council - which said it already spent Â£500,000 on hotel rooms - said it would reimburse residents who have paid for their own temporary accommodation. It has also set aside Â£100,000 for food and essential items for displaced residents. Fire crews have been put on watch at the Chalcots estate The work at Chalcots is expected to take three to four weeks. Sayed Mead, a resident on the estate who left his flat, told BBC Breakfast that not knowing where he was going to be housed had been ""eating me away"". He has now been given accommodation but said the council had created ""panic"" among the residents. Do you live in one of the tower blocks that have failed fire cladding safety tests?

Tanker inferno kills scores in Pakistan,"This video can not be played People smoking at the scene may have sparked the fire A lorry carrying fuel has burst into flames near the Pakistani city of Ahmedpur East, killing at least 150 people, local officials say. Villagers had gathered, reportedly to collect fuel leaking from the crashed tanker, when it caught fire. Dozens are being treated in hospital. It appears the tanker blew a tyre while rounding a sharp bend in the road. The fire was sparked by a passer-by lighting a cigarette, a rescue services spokesman told the BBC. ""The incident, which was a minor [one], turned into a major blast,"" Jam Sajjad said. Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif is cutting short a visit to London in response to the incident, the Pakistani government news agency, APP, reported. Army helicopters were dispatched to ferry casualties to hospitals, army spokesman Maj Gen Asif Ghafoor said in atweet,external. There are fears that the death toll could rise further. Some of the victims may only be identified by DNA sampling, as the bodies were so badly burned in the incident, reports say. Police sources told APP that the tanker had been transporting 25,000 litres (5,500 gallons) of fuel from Karachi to Lahore. Charred motorbikes littered the road It left the road and overturned in the Kachi Pul area, they said, about 8km (five miles) from Ahmedpur East, in Punjab's Bahawalpur district. Police sources said that people in nearby villages had rushed to the scene to collect fuel in pots, and also made phone calls to their relatives in other villages to come to collect the fuel. Some fire victims were brought to the Nishtar hospital in Multan Traffic police had tried in vain to keep the crowds away from the tanker as local people, including women and children, continued collecting fuel, the sources said. A huge fire then erupted, engulfing all the people standing around the vehicle, they said. Emergency services have struggled to find burns units to treat the injured, APP says. The Ahmedpur Sharqia Health Centre and Bahawal Victoria Hospital have no such units, but some casualties were taken to Nishtar hospital in Multan and others to hospitals in the city of Bahawalpur, about 50km away. The country's roads are notoriously dangerous, with poor vehicle maintenance and reckless driving contributing to the problem. Many die in Pakistan bus crash.

10 miscarriages but still trying,"This video can not be played ""I want to look at a child and see my husband looking back up at me"" Jen Bickel and her husband Andrew are no strangers to heartache, having suffered 10 miscarriages in as many years. The 39-year-old, from Cardiff, has endured several rounds of punishing IVF, two ectopic pregnancies resulting in surgery, and she is still no closer to finding out the cause of the problem. Here, in her own words, she talks about the couple's devastating losses, how attending a memorial service for one of their lost babies helped them grieve and why they are not giving hope just yet. The couple met on a school trip when they were teenagers That feeling of lying on the bed waiting for the scan with Andrew sat next to me holding my hand, I'm just watching the faces of the hospital staff for any signs. It's a feeling of ""here we go again"". We're so used to this now, it's 10 times. I've probably had every type of management of a miscarriage. I've had a D and C (dilation and curettage) where they remove the embryo through surgery, I've gone into hospital and had tablets which help it come away and I've just come home and waited for it to happen naturally. None is any easier than the other. We'd always wanted our own family. Andrew and I have been married for 10 years and got together about 10 years before that. But I wanted to get married first and we didn't get married until we were 29. So we were a bit late I suppose and started trying straight away then. We had our first miscarriage about six months later. Even now we don't know why they happen, we just keep being told it's bad luck. We started trying and caught straight away but I had a bleed and realised something wasn't right. We went to the hospital and were scanned quite early and had lots of blood tests and realised it had already gone. We were quite devastated the first time, all our friends were getting pregnant so it was quite heartbreaking. Because then you've got to see all your friends starting their families and having exactly what you want but can't have. Jen Bickel (r) and her husband Andrew on their wedding day 10 years ago We left it a couple of months and started trying again but it took us 18 months to get pregnant. We thought everything was fine the second time but at about 11 weeks, just before my three-month scan, I started to bleed. We went to the hospital and they could see that the sack had continued growing but the embryo had stopped growing at about six or seven weeks and there was no heartbeat. We were devastated and went to the doctors at that point and they sent us for some tests. They sent us to a consultant to look into it and he was more concerned that we hadn't got pregnant for 18 months. We had further tests - tests to check my tubes weren't blocked, tests for Andrew - which all came back pretty much clear and after another natural, but unsuccessful pregnancy, they put us on the route of IVF. It takes a few weeks, lots of injections lots of scans, lots of appointments. If anything, you've probably got more time to build your hopes up. When you get that positive pregnancy result and you wait for a scan, there's a couple of weeks of not knowing. But with IVF, at every stage it could go wrong. When they're collecting the eggs there may not be enough there, once they've collected them they might not be mature enough, then when they fertilise them you think ""are they going to fertilise? Are they going to become embryos?"" Then you've got to wait a couple of days for them to develop, ""are they going to make that stage?"" And then when they finally go back in it's ""are they going take?"" At every stage you're on edge, worrying, and then you've got a two-week wait to see if you're actually pregnant and that two weeks is just the worst. I had two rounds of IVF on the NHS, but one wasn't successful and the other resulted in a miscarriage at six or seven weeks - it's always around the same time. The couple live in Cardiff with their dog Bertie We begged and borrowed from family and saved every penny to have one round of IVF that we paid for. It was unsuccessful unfortunately and there were no extra embryos we could use. But we were fortunate that the clinic we used rang us and offered us a free round of treatment if we could fund the medication which was still quite expensive. Of three embryo transfers two were successful, one wasn't. I'm not sure what's worse - getting that positive result and then having a miscarriage or not getting that positive result at all. They're both equally heartbreaking. Finding out I'm pregnant is always slightly happy - having that positive pregnancy test is a lovely feeling but it's quickly followed by ""oh, let's not get too excited, let's not get our hopes up, let's wait until we get our scans"". You're secretly hoping everything will be ok, but not letting yourself get too attached to it. Not letting yourself think about setting up a nursery or buying buggies. I like to stay positive because I'm a positive person but also in the back of your mind you're thinking, ""is it going to be all right this time?"" There's always that hope but then there's always that niggling thought that it's probably not. You think as long as there's no bleeding or pain it might be ok this time, I might just get through it. Andrew and Jen started trying for a baby shortly after they got married But we've been there for each other. Through each time, one of us is strong and the other one can break down a bit. It brings the other one back up again. It has probably brought us closer. I would imagine a lot of people don't get through it because it's so hard. But we've never blamed each other. That's a big thing. You blame yourself but we've never blamed each other. My husband is amazing, he's there through every appointment, holding my hand, sat in the hospital waiting room - just whatever I need. And then there's been times when he's really bad and once I'm on my feet I do the same and pull him up. IVF is around Â£5,000 to Â£6,000 a time which adds to the stress. Especially as my last two pregnancies have been ectopic which resulted in surgery and losing a fallopian tube each time. With the first one I went into hospital thinking I was just having an appointment and within two or three hours I was being operated on which was quite scary. Sometimes they catch it early and they can save the tube but in my case the tube had ruptured which can be life-threatening. I was really lucky, it was keyhole surgery but afterwards you're trying to get over the operation so you're not really thinking about the loss of a child. Jen Bickel says the couple have not yet given up hope on having their own child The second time, the first suggestion when they thought it was ectopic was ""shall we book you in for surgery and take the other tube?"" As a woman who's not got any children yet, and still desperately wants them, I felt it was a little insensitive. But I suppose they were looking at what they needed to do. A couple of weeks after one of my ectopic pregnancies I had a phone call asking me if I had made funeral arrangements. I think in the haze of everything going on and needing surgery I must have ticked the box and said I wanted to arrange a funeral. I was quite shocked because it was an eight-week embryo and I didn't really think you could have a funeral for an eight-week embryo. I had to go to the bereavement office in the Heath hospital where I spoke to a lovely lady who told me that if the hospital deal with it there's a memorial service for anyone that's lost a child or lost an early pregnancy. My husband and I went and it was really lovely. I think it just really helped us think ""yes, we have lost a child"", it's not just an embryo. We'd lost all those hopes and dreams you have as soon as you get that positive pregnancy test. It's the first time I'd heard of it but it definitely helped. It was just me and my husband and one other couple there. It was only a short a service - about 10 minutes - but it just really helped to mark it. It was the chaplain that did the service and they just talked about your children being up in heaven. It wasn't majorly religious, it was quite comforting. Me and Andrew decided to mark it by going for a little meal, just the two of us, and talking. It was quite a nice thing to do and there's a memorial garden in the crematorium where you can go and lay flowers and spend time if you want as well. Despite all we've been through, we're not giving up yet. I want our baby. I want to look at a child and see my husband looking back up at me. I want that feeling - to feel it growing inside of me and all those things that you go through and at the moment I just can't give up hope for that. I'm sure there will come a time when I might feel differently, my age is against me now, I'm getting older. But at the moment I've got three embryos in storage, I know we won't be able to afford any more rounds of IVF so these three embryos are our last hope. I think that makes us almost put-off doing it because, while they're still there, we've still got hope for the future. That's the safety blanket and once that's gone, it's gone. Then you've got to really change your aspect on how you want to live your life. We might consider adoption, I think we've got a lot to give a child, so it's something we might consider later on but at the moment I can't think about it. I've still got to keep my hope. There's new things happening all the time and hopefully we will find the right thing that will help us and have a bit of good luck for a change. It's hard, but with the support of my husband and my family and my friends, we get through it. We keep focussed; I keep my eye on the prize.

The horrors of Yemen's spiralling cholera crisis,"The spread of cholera in Yemen is accelerating, the ICRC says Children dying in hospital hallways. Four sick people crammed into one bed. Patients connected to intravenous drips while sitting in their cars because the hospital is over capacity. Welcome to the Yemeni healthcare system in 2017. The bizarre and haunting scenes I have witnessed recently in the capital, Sanaa, are the consequences of a health catastrophe spiralling out of control. In a country where vital infrastructure is devastated by a brutal and ongoing war, the toll of this cholera outbreak grows by the thousands every day. Cholera has affected around 268 districts in 20 provinces across the country Despite the sickness, the hospitals do not smell of vomit and diarrhoea. Instead, they smell of body odour - a testament to the overcrowding in many of these facilities. Packed rooms and hallways are quiet. Patients look at us, with no expression. Parents hold the hands of their children, some of whose eyes roll into the back of their heads. Yemen conflict: How bad is the humanitarian crisis? Inside the fight to save Yemen's health system Yemen crisis: Who is fighting whom? Overburdened medical staff do what they can but often do not have enough supplies or knowledge - two reasons cholera has spread so fast. The cholera outbreak has infected more than 200,000 people across Yemen, and it appears that 500,000 could eventually become sick. More than 1,300 people have already died. Yemen's health ministry and the United Nations have given advice on how to prevent cholera The disease should not be so ferocious. Preventing cholera is pretty simple in theory: wash your hands with clean water, drink clean water, and eat food that has been boiled or cooked. But clean water in Yemen is a luxury. Municipal workers in Sanaa have not been paid in months. And so we have no electricity, rubbish piling high in the street, and a crippled water system. The sewer system stopped working on 17 April. Ten days later, cholera hit. Poor sanitation and the lack of safe drinking water made the population more susceptible A massive response is needed, and not nearly enough international attention is being paid to what is going on here. Yemen was until relatively recently a functional country. Sitting on the southern tip of the Arabian Peninsula, it has always had its shortcomings, but the education and health systems were working. Clean water and electricity ran 24 hours a day. Rubbish was collected. In an astonishingly short period of time, though, those pillars of a healthy society crumbled, beginning with the Arab Spring and accelerating during today's full-blown war. Violence is now part of life; I hear air strikes even as I write this. Two years of conflict have devastated Yemen and left 18 million people in need of aid Hospital systems have collapsed, with medical staff no longer paid. The staff who remain are overwhelmed. My organisation, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), is currently providing care to nearly one in five cholera cases in the country - the biggest single provider of case management and infection control. The ICRC has flown in five charter planes carrying large quantities of chlorine, IV fluids and other medical supplies in recent days. ICRC health staff and engineers are supporting 17 cholera treatment facilities around the country. We are improving hygiene and sanitation conditions, and raising cholera awareness among the general public. The ICRC has flown medical supplies to Yemen to help deal with the outbreak We provide what we can, where we can. But even with similar work being done by MÃ©decins Sans FrontiÃ¨res (MSF) and the World Health Organisation (WHO), there are simply too many people in need. We are impressed with the Yemeni ministry of health staff, who work day and night without pay or protection, exposing themselves and their families to sickness. The dedication is beyond commendable. To help motivate - or say thank-you - the ICRC gave a modest Eid al-Fitr bonus at the end of Ramadan. But we know it is not enough. More than 14 million people lack access to safe drinking water or sanitation This is my third mission to Yemen. I love the country. There is nowhere on earth like this anymore. It is complex and fascinating, the Arabia I once dreamed about visiting. But this mission to Yemen has been less dream, more nightmare. I think the vacant stares in the eyes of children - and their parents - may well haunt me 10 years from now. Yemen now suffers three-way tragedy: a population under siege, suffering the violence of war and unable to work or access nutritious food or health care; an economic collapse that has led to a rise in criminality; and now a devastating health crisis. This all leads to what could be the largest cholera outbreak of our lifetime. More than half of all health facilities in Yemen are closed or partially functioning I have worked with the ICRC for 11 years, but this is the first time I have seen this kind of suffering. The Yemenis' remaining resilience will be sapped. But even if a miracle materialises and the cholera crisis disappears tomorrow, the ongoing war remains. The people here will still not find the nutrition they need. And the country will be in much worse shape than before. The deadly imprint of cholera will continue to grow, and its effects will cripple this fragile, war-weary society far into the future.

What can politicians do to win over young voters?,"Jeremy Corbyn continued his drive to appeal to young people with a visit to Glastonbury this weekend. But how can politicians get more young people to support them at the ballot box? Turnout amongst 18-24 year olds rose from 43% in 2015 to 54% in the latest general election and most of them voted Labour, latest polling data shows. It's a ""wake up call"", or a ""tipping point"" - says Dr James Sloam, co-director of Centre for European Politics at Royal Holloway University. Reality Check: Has there been a surge in youth turnout? UK election: Six key lessons from a surprise result He says the increase in the youth vote has got to effect the agenda. ""What we know is that once people vote, they tend to vote for the same party again. Politicians cannot ignore young people on a permanent basis."" And what's more, this section of the electorate is now ""anyone's to play for"", Caroline Macfarland, director of think tank Common Vision, says. Young people in the UK are as interested in politics as elsewhere - volunteering and being involved in community engagement projects - they are just spoken to less by politicians, Dr Sloam says. He believes a centralised Westminster government and a break down of local government, also contribute to this lack of conversation. Ms Macfarland agrees: ""Millennials are more likely to sign a petition, attend a protest and join a campaign on a singular issue. ""Young people expect transparency and are less interested in political structures. These structures need to change and be more responsive to public sentiment."" In other words, this generation is unlikely to write a letter to their MP, or even email one, but they will still expect to see a reaction from government on issues that matter to them. If they want to see change, they do it themselves - whether it's boycotting a brand or buying a different food, Ms Macfarland says. Politicians are no longer the fixers or doers, they are the enablers, she adds. ""These are people who aren't concerned with immigration, but are worried about the environment,"" says Dr Sloam. ""The environment wasn't even an issue in this election. Here, young people can have more influence in the debate."" Dr Avril Keating, director for the Centre for Global Youth at the UCL-Institute of Education agrees: ""Younger people tend to be more supportive of multiculturalism and inclusion."" Common Vision has put together a Millennial Manifesto for generation Y - that's those now aged between 18 and 35 - that it argues has a more ""everyday"" political agenda than generations before. Looking at the environment - it suggests a policy which isn't just about how much energy we use, but how we think about these resources too. One way of doing this would be through so-called ""bottom-up"" supply models - where citizens could be involved in renewable energy generation on a local level. This video can not be played Should 'Generation Rent' try co-living? Dr Keating argues that ultimately young people want the same things as everyone else; good wages and the prospect of owning a house. Consecutive governments have promised to build 'X' amount of homes, with the debate focused on ""supply and demand"" or ""buy or rent"". But young people tend to be less binary according to Ms Macfarland. The Millennial manifesto points to examples of self-build, community housing and co-living models - where people share spaces and facilities - which are already happening in the UK and abroad. In Germany - where almost half of Germany's first-time voters back Chancellor Angela Merkel - housing problems are similar to those in the UK. But their government has invested in greater rental regulation, where rents are only increased if improvements are made, tenants have long term agreements and are able to save money in a different way to paying a mortgage. ""Germany looks 10-20 years in the future with its policy,"" Dr Sloam says, but he admits these types of policy are costly. It is this long term thinking that could be the real ""win"" for policy makers though, according to Ms Macfarland ""Look beyond the five-year term - policy makers would instead be appealing to voters with five decades ahead of them,"" she said. This is the generation that has born the brunt of the financial crisis with uncertainty, unemployment and wage freezes being a staple of their adult life. Young people experienced the tightest pay squeeze in the wake of the financial crisis - with real pay falling by 13%, according to the Resolution Foundation. While a lot of people have heard the ""gig"" economy being discussed, the debate has had a negative focus on the challenges around workers rights, rather than the opportunity the market offers. In the gig economy - instead of a regular wage, workers get paid for the ""gigs"" they do, such as a food delivery or a car journey. In the UK it's estimated that five million people are employed in this way. Employment law needs to be brought up to date to protect this flexible and dynamic labour market, but also offer security, policy analyst Laura Gardiner from the Resolution Foundation says. What is the 'gig' economy? Meanwhile the Millennial Manifesto points to personal development and work life balance, which it says are seen as more important than financial reward - and so a focus on workplace conditions and flexibility is as important as a focus on pay. Current policy has punished the under 25s - who don't get minimum wage, by treating them like they are not adults, Dr Keating says. Surveillance, misuse of data, privacy and hacking are all issues that Dr Huw Davies of the Oxford Internet Institute believes young voters of the future will be concerned about. ""Young people are already participating in the digital economy off their own backs,"" he says. ""They are recognising their future could be in a gig economy with a collection of jobs as opposed to one role."" With a new computer science curriculum already in the education system, pupils are learning about encryption and data provenance. It's only a matter of time Dr Davies argues, before people become aware of how ignorant governments have previously been on these issues. Politicians won't get away with saying ""backdoor encryption"" then, Dr Davies says.

Canada to apologise for past 'LGBT purge',"Canada is planning to apologise for past persecutions of LGBT citizens During the Cold War, hundreds of gay men and lesbians in Canada lost government and military jobs because of their sexual orientation after being harassed and interrogated under a national security campaign now dubbed the ""LGBT purge"". In 1986, Simon Thwaites was ordered into a meeting with the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) special investigative unit. Investigators questioned the then-naval officer about his HIV status - positive, but asymptomatic. Then they asked him to identify friends and other military members who were gay. After the meeting, Thwaites' security clearance was downgraded and he was re-assigned to menial tasks. His commanding officer recommended he be let go from the military because of his sexual orientation. In 1989, he was released for medical reasons. Thwaites is one of hundreds of Canadian military and government employees who were drummed out of careers because of their sexual orientation, but the now 55-year-old's case is one of the most well-documented. That's in part because he challenged his dismissal, and in 1994 a Canadian human rights tribunal found the military should have accommodated him, regardless of his HIV status. He received compensation, but no pension or medical coverage. He had lost his job, his home, his car. Decades later, he says it still makes him angry. Later this year, the Canadian government is expected to apologise to Thwaites and all those in the federal civil service, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) and the CAF who were subjected to a campaign of interrogation and harassment from the 1950s to the 1990s because of their sexuality. In doing so, Canada will join countries like the UK, Australia and Germany in issuing official mea culpas for past injustices to their LGBT citizens. Germany to quash 50,000 gay convictions 'Alan Turing law': Thousands of gay men to be pardoned If the apology does come, says Thwaites, it will be significant. It ""reaffirms the fact that we're not broken, there's not something horribly wrong with us"", he says from his home in Halifax. ""We didn't do anything wrong by just being ourselves."" Chechen gay men hopeful of finding refuge In the heat of the Cold War, gay men and lesbians in the civil service and the military were believed to pose a security risk, vulnerable to blackmail by Soviet agents. Official figures are hard to come by, but hundreds of people are believed to have lost their jobs over the course of some four decades. Others were demoted, transferred or denied promotions. A primitive lie detector used by the Canadian government to detect security risks during the Cold War, similar to the 'fruit machine' Some were given the choice between being dismissed or undergoing psychiatric treatment. In one bizarre effort in the 1960s, the government tried to develop an instrument dubbed the ""fruit machine"" by the RCMP. The brainchild of researcher Frank Robert Wake, it was a crude detector built to identify homosexuals by monitoring pupil dilation when a person was exposed to pornography. Plagued with problems, the project was eventually mothballed. In 1992, former army officer Michelle Douglas helped bring an end to discriminatory policies towards gays and lesbians. After being discharged from the army because she was a lesbian, Ms Douglas launched a legal challenge and on the eve of the trial the military settled the case and changed its practices. Four years later, the Canadian Human Rights Act was amended to include sexual orientation. This month, Canada added gender identity and gender orientation to the Act. Thwaites is part of a class action lawsuit against the federal government for discrimination. Lawyers representing those suing say an apology and redress are long overdue. One of those lawyers, Douglas Elliott, estimates up to 10,000 people across the country could eventually be part of the class action, which combines three related cases. Given the compensation requested in those previous lawsuits, ""a fair figure would be C$1bn"" ($757m; Â£594m), Elliot says. He hopes to settle with the Liberal government within the next two years. Activists and others who have lobbied the government for years on this issue say the shame of being forced out of careers has left many with emotional scars. Like Thwaites, ""Bernie"" is part of the class action lawsuit. He asked his real name not be used to protect his family's privacy. In 1984, the ex-sailor had just celebrated his 23rd birthday when military police asked if they could search his apartment. At first, he thought they were looking for drugs. What they found were birthday cards sitting on his dining room table, many ""gay oriented"", he said. He was repeatedly interrogated by military police, asked detailed questions about his sexual activity. He was told to give up the names of other gay people in the military he knew. He refused. Within months he was discharged. ""They considered me a security risk. They called me a sexual deviant. They offered me rehabilitation. I said: 'I'm not sick.'"" He says his unit - all straight men - took him out to a gay bar on his last day. ""The ones who actually had an issue with gay people were outnumbered, they really were,"" he says. ""But since it was such a powerful charge, such a powerful thing, it didn't matter. All you needed was an accusation."" He moved back to his home province and went back into the closet soon after, including a brief, failed marriage. At 56, he is still struggling to come to terms with his sexuality. ""Life was good until they found out I was gay,"" he says. He plans to be in Ottawa for the apology because he wants it publicly recognised what happened to him was wrong. ""I want them to know what they did to us,"" he says.  ""Even though it happened 33 years ago, it's like it happened yesterday. The pain is still there. And I don't think they appreciate it. This is a lifelong punishment."" Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has promised an apology this year Earlier this month, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the government will not only issue the formal apology but will expunge the records of people criminalised for their sexuality. Liberal MP Randy Boissonnault, Trudeau's special advisor on LGBTQ2 issues, says he has heard many ""heartbreaking"" stories like Thwaites and Bernie's and says it is ""critical"" for the government to acknowledge past wrongs. ""It's the right thing to do,"" Boissonnault says. ""People's lives and careers were turned upside down."" The apology is planned for this year, as many civil servants and former military personnel who were targeted are advancing in age. Boissonnault says the government wanted to take time to consult broadly to ensure it is done right. ""We can't move forward as a country, we can't move forward as a community, until this is done,"" he says.

Mother held after children die in hot car,"Cynthia Marie Randolph was arrested on Friday, police say A Texas mother is facing charges over the deaths of her two children from heat exposure after they were found locked in a car last month, police say. They say Cynthia Marie Randolph has admitted she shut the door to teach her two-year-old daughter Juliet a ""lesson"" after she had refused to leave the car. Juliet and her 16-month-old brother Cavanaugh were pronounced dead at about 16:30 on 26 May. Temperatures outside at that time were about 96F (35.5C), police say. The incident happened at Ms Randolph's home near Lake Weatherford, the Parker County Sheriff's office says. It says that ""throughout multiple interviews, Randolph created several variations of the events which led to the death of her children"". In her initial statements, she said her children had entered the vehicle on their own, locking themselves inside. The 24-year-old mother also said that after finding them she had broken a car window to try to save them. But she eventually admitted that she had found children playing in the car at about 12:15 on that day. When Juliet refused to leave the vehicle, she closed the door ""to teach her daughter a 'lesson', thinking 'she could get herself and her brother out of car when ready,'"" the sheriff's office says in a news release. It says the mother then went inside the house and smoked marijuana before falling asleep for between two to three hours. She has also admitted that she broke the car window to make the deaths look like an accident, the release says. Ms Randolph is now facing two felony charges of injury to a child causing serious bodily injury.

Six hurt as car ploughs into crowd,"This video can not be played ""Everybody was in a panic"" A woman has been bailed after six people, including three children, were injured when a car mounted a kerb and ploughed into a crowd of people. The crash happened outside Newcastle's Westgate Sports Centre where an Eid event was taking place. Northumbria Police said four people remained in hospital on Monday being treated for ""various injuries"". The force added that a 42-year-old woman has been released on conditional bail pending further investigation. The incident was not believed to be terrorism-related.

The woman who was arrested had been celebrating the end of Ramadan with her family and hundreds of others when the collision happened at 09:14 BST on Sunday. One eyewitness said: ""From what I understand [a woman who had been at prayer] was about to leave in her car and I believe she lost control. ""I ran up straight away because everyone was moving in on all the injured, trying to put water in their mouths. ""The parents of the kids were there. I had to sort of try and calm them down just to tell them the ambulance is there and they will take care of it; they know what they're doing."" Emergency services included six ambulances, two paramedic rapid response vehicles and the air ambulance. In a statement, the nearby Newcastle Central Mosque said: ""We pray and hope that all those affected recover soon fully.

Extra security for 'largest' Eid party,"Organisers say people of all faiths are welcome at the event Celebrations are under way at one of Europe's largest end-of-Ramadan events. Armed officers and extra patrols are at Birmingham's Small Heath Park for Eid al-Fitr where organisers estimated 100,000 people gathered for prayers. Amer Ijaz, one of the event's organisers, said they were ""happy that they are here to reassure us"". Additional security was agreed after the series of terror attacks in Manchester and London, most recently near Finsbury Park Mosque. Mr Ijaz added organisers had been working in partnership with West Midlands Police. ""But it's just a shame that we are in these times where we are having to have the police made available to us so we can prevent certain things from happening,"" he said. ""But you know what, as Brummies, as UK citizens, we are going to get over this and we are going to stand together united and strong."" Officers would be at key locations, with ""a range of specialist officers on duty,"" the force said. Armed police were stationed on gates and at other key locations It is the seventh year the event has been held in the park and organisers worked with five Birmingham mosques ""to bring the community together"". Concerns about Muslims being targets for attacks have been repeatedsince the Finsbury attackjust after midnight on Monday when a van struck a number of people. Organisers estimate 100,000 joined in prayers at the start of the event Birmingham Central Mosque's chairman said Muslims in the West Midlands felt ""under siege"" and potentially blamed for the recent terror attacks carried out in the name of so-called Islamic State. Mohammed Afzal said: ""Whatever happens, everybody starts feeling very afraid as if they are going to be attacked or they are going to blamed for it. ""They feel as if the whole world is against them and their future in this country is not that secure, unfortunately. That is the feeling of most of the people."" Security has been stepped up at Birmingham Central Mosque, the chairman said Mr Afzal said police and local authorities were doing ""their best"" to tackle hate crime against Muslims and the police presence around mosques had increased after events such as the terror attack in Manchester. Mr Afzal said Muslim people were becoming ""fed-up"" of condemning attacks ""because they are happening so frequently"". ""There is too much being expected of us because the general public - 99.9% - they are law-abiding citizens and have nothing to do with these terrorists and we don't believe they are the true Muslims,"" he said. A vigil was held on Monday after the Finsbury terror attack West Midlands Assistant Chief Constable Sarah Boycott said: ""Over the last few weeks communities will have seen more police officers carrying out enhanced patrols across the West Midlands at key locations, including places of worship. ""These additional measures continue and are to reassure people worried by the recent events and not in response to any local threat."" Organisers of the Small Heath event said in a statement: ""Celebrate Eid has always been open to the entire community and we welcome people of all faiths to join. As our numbers grow, so does our commitment to our community and our passion for peace and inclusion.""

Post-Brexit deals for 'poorest countries',"Free trade deals with developing countries will continue post-Brexit, the government has said. The UK will maintain an EU deal, which provides 48 countries with duty-free access to Britain for imports. It means British firms do not pay import tariffs on goods bought from countries such as Bangladesh and Haiti. International Trade Secretary Liam Fox said Brexit gave the country an opportunity ""to step up our commitments to the rest of the world"". He added: ""Free and fair trade has been the greatest liberator of the world's poor, and today's announcement shows our commitment to helping developing countries grow their economies and reduce poverty through trade.""

Archbishop: 'Draw the poison from Brexit',"The Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby urged Mrs May to set up a cross-party commission The Archbishop of Canterbury has urged the prime minister to set up a cross-party commission to ""draw much of the poison"" from Brexit negotiations. Justin Welby toldthe Mail on Sunday,externalthe UK needed a united negotiating strategy for exiting the EU. He said the commission should be under Parliament's authority, chaired by a senior politician. Cabinet minister Priti Patel rejected the idea and said ministers were focused on getting ""the right deal"". Formal Brexit negotiations began last Monday in Brussels. Key subjects to be negotiated include the status of EU nationals and Britons living elsewhere in the EU, the size of any ""divorce"" bill and how the UK will trade with the EU once it leaves. In his article, the archbishop wrote that - with a hung parliament - there was ""an understandable temptation for every difference to become a vote of confidence"". Brexit: All you need to know Davis 'pretty sure' of free trade deal Free trade deals for 'poorest countries' May unveils Brexit offer for EU citizens But he said that would be a ""disaster"", as British negotiators would not have ""confidence in their backing from the UK"". He claimed a commission, with parties from the whole political spectrum, could ""hold the ring for the differences [in opinion] to be fought out"". It should be under the authority of the Commons, and chaired by a senior politician, but without the authority to bind Parliament, he said. ""We need the politicians to find a way of neutralising the temptation to take minor advantage domestically from these great events,"" the archbishop wrote. He added that Britain's decision to leave the EU was the third time in two centuries that the UK had to ""redefine the place of our country in the world"". But International Development Secretary Priti Patel rejected the idea of a cross-party commission. She told BBC Radio 5 live's Pienaar's Politics: ""I think the point is, this isn't about commissions. The public voted last year to leave the European Union. Our job as government now is obviously securing the right deal for the country and not rerunning those arguments of Remain and Leave from last year."" In the same article, the archbishop said the Grenfell Tower fire - and the recent terror attacks in Manchester and London - had ""brought out the best of communities in crisis"". ""Communities have staggered, stumbled and pulled themselves up,"" he wrote. ""I am so proud and grateful to be part of a country where people at Westminster rush to treat a man who has just tried to kill them, where an imam ensures the would-be killer whose van is still resting on one of his congregation is protected."" The UK is due to leave the EU by the end of March 2019.

Pakistan oil tanker fire kills scores,"This video can not be played People smoking at the scene may have sparked the fire A lorry carrying fuel has burst into flames near the Pakistani city of Ahmedpur East, killing at least 150 people, local officials say. Villagers had gathered, reportedly to collect fuel leaking from the crashed tanker, when it caught fire. Dozens are being treated in hospital. It appears the tanker blew a tyre while rounding a sharp bend in the road. The fire was sparked by a passer-by lighting a cigarette, a rescue services spokesman told the BBC. ""The incident, which was a minor [one], turned into a major blast,"" Jam Sajjad said. Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif is cutting short a visit to London in response to the incident, the Pakistani government news agency, APP, reported. Army helicopters were dispatched to ferry casualties to hospitals, army spokesman Maj Gen Asif Ghafoor said in atweet,external. There are fears that the death toll could rise further. Some of the victims may only be identified by DNA sampling, as the bodies were so badly burned in the incident, reports say. Police sources told APP that the tanker had been transporting 25,000 litres (5,500 gallons) of fuel from Karachi to Lahore. Charred motorbikes littered the road It left the road and overturned in the Kachi Pul area, they said, about 8km (five miles) from Ahmedpur East, in Punjab's Bahawalpur district. Police sources said that people in nearby villages had rushed to the scene to collect fuel in pots, and also made phone calls to their relatives in other villages to come to collect the fuel. Some fire victims were brought to the Nishtar hospital in Multan Traffic police had tried in vain to keep the crowds away from the tanker as local people, including women and children, continued collecting fuel, the sources said. A huge fire then erupted, engulfing all the people standing around the vehicle, they said. Emergency services have struggled to find burns units to treat the injured, APP says. The Ahmedpur Sharqia Health Centre and Bahawal Victoria Hospital have no such units, but some casualties were taken to Nishtar hospital in Multan and others to hospitals in the city of Bahawalpur, about 50km away. The country's roads are notoriously dangerous, with poor vehicle maintenance and reckless driving contributing to the problem. Many die in Pakistan bus crash.

Yemen in world's 'worst cholera outbreak',"No part of Yemen has been spared from the cholera outbreak, the UN says Yemen is now facing the worst cholera outbreak anywhere in the world, the United Nations has warned. A statement by Unicef and the World Health Organization,externalsays the number of suspected cholera cases in the war-torn country has exceeded 200,000. So far more than 1,300 people have died - one quarter of them children - with the death toll expected to rise. The two UN agencies say they are doing everything they can to stop the outbreak from accelerating. ""We are now facing the worst cholera outbreak in the world,"" the statement says. ""In just two months, cholera has spread to almost every governorate of this war-torn country,"" it says, with an estimated 5,000 new cases every day. Children have been hit especially hard by the cholera outbreak Hospitals have been overwhelmed by the number of people afflicted by cholera Yemen's health, water and sanitation systems are collapsing after two years of war between government forces, backed by a Saudi-led coalition, and the rebel Houthi movement. The rebels control much of the country, including the capital Sanaa. Hospitals are overcrowded and severe food shortages have led to widespread malnutrition, making Yemenis - especially children - even more vulnerable to cholera. Yemen's spiralling cholera crisis How bad is the humanitarian crisis? Yemen crisis: Who is fighting whom? The UN says it is deploying rapid-response teams to go house-to-house telling people how to protect themselves by cleaning and storing drinking water. But clean water is in short supply. Cholera is an acute diarrhoeal infection caused by ingestion of food or water contaminated with the bacterium Vibrio cholera. Most of those infected will have no or mild symptoms but, in severe cases, the disease can kill within hours if left untreated. The war has left 18.8 million of Yemen's 28 million people needing humanitarian assistance and almost seven million on the brink of famine.

Free trade deals for 'poorest countries',"Free trade deals with developing countries will continue post-Brexit, the government has said. The UK will maintain an EU deal, which provides 48 countries with duty-free access to Britain for imports. It means British firms do not pay import tariffs on goods bought from countries such as Bangladesh and Haiti. International Trade Secretary Liam Fox said Brexit gave the country an opportunity ""to step up our commitments to the rest of the world"". He added: ""Free and fair trade has been the greatest liberator of the world's poor, and today's announcement shows our commitment to helping developing countries grow their economies and reduce poverty through trade."" The deal excludes arms and ammunitions. What are Brexit Britain's trade options?

The teenagers growing up with cancer,"Every day in the UK seven teenagers find out they have cancer. At the Royal Hospital for Children in Glasgow, the Teenage Cancer Trust has set up a specially-designed ""teen-only"" unit. The unit brings together young people from all over Scotland who are dealing with cancer, so they don't have to face it alone. Natasha has been diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma, a type of blood cancer, and comes to the unit five times a week for chemotherapy. She told BBC documentaryGrowing Up With Cancer: ""When someone says to you the word 'cancer', you just go blank."" ""It started sinking in when my hair started falling out. That's when it properly sunk in."" For Natasha, and for all patients undergoing chemotherapy, going bald changes the way they see themselves and how other people view them. She says: ""It is so confusing because I miss the old self. ""Before I thought I'm never going to walk out bald, I'll always have my wigs on every time I walk out of the house. ""But now I don't care if people are looking at me because it's not their life."" She says the wigs are hot and heavy and sometimes hurt her ears and give her a sore head. Natasha says she tries to have ""positive thoughts"" But she says ""positive thinking"" gets her through. ""It's hard with something like this at the beginning when you get told but when you get into it there's nothing else you can do,"" she says. ""You've got it, deal with it - and that's it."" The 15-year-old says she wants to be a lawyer one day. She says: ""After this I'd never take health for granted. ""When I get married and have kids that'll be my main priority - my health, because anything could happen at any point. ""I'll just focus on my health and my education now, that's it."" Nairn was worried about losing his hair Nairn, who is 14, says: ""I started getting unwell about January time. I thought it was a chest infection. ""Then I started to get a bit sicker, coughing and things like that. It was bringing my mood down. I lost a lot of energy and I just felt horrible. ""I was going straight home to my bed. I was crying a lot, the emotions were building up in me so much I didn't know what to think."" He allowed the cameras to film him and his parents as he got his diagnosis from consultant haematologist Dr Nick Heaney. He faces treatment for Hodgkin's lymphoma, the same cancer as Natasha. When he gets his diagnosis, he is worried about falling behind with his school work and he is also concerned about the affect on his family. Nairn says: ""I don't want my mum and dad to be worried and I wouldn't want anyone else to be. ""The smile on my face helps them to cope I feel. ""Obviously as a teenager you're going to get grumpy so I've tried to maintain a good behaviour with them and it has kind of worked but it's difficult. ""Sometimes I want to be a bit grumpy but I need to keep that smile on because I know it is helping them through it."" And as he tries to stay positive he says he does not like other people saying ""I'm so sorry"". ""It just brings down the mood,"" he says. ""I'd much rather everyone acts as normal."" Nairn says the treatment is ""tough, tiring and simply quite boring"". He says: ""I just wish I could wake up and it was just a dream but it's not and I have to deal with it."" As his chemo progresses his skin breaks out and he suffers mouth ulcers and cracked lips. And, like Natasha, losing his hair is a major moment. Nairn tells Natasha he loves his hair and would spend ages getting it just right. She is three months ahead of him in her chemo treatment and offers support, telling him to ""embrace"" the baldness. Nairn says: ""Natasha was really supportive and I think it was really helpful talking to her about what kind of symptoms she had. ""I think she helped me embrace what was wrong with me a bit more. ""I think I'm just going to continue life as it was before and I hope everyone can do the same."" Declan was back in hospital after a relapse Declan was in the unit for a stem cell transplant after a relapse of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, an aggressive form of cancer. For the first month or more he was placed in isolation while his immune system was shut down in preparation. He said: ""I started my treatment almost two years ago and I was doing fine. I was on a maintenance part of treatment but then I relapsed. ""They took me for a bone marrow and they found out the chemo hadn't worked, which was horrible news. ""I was just transitioning from child to teenager. I had to grow up pretty fast."" After seven weeks in isolation, Declan's stem cell transplant is working and he's back in the teenage ward. He says the thought of going home got him through it. ""The thought of going home and being normal again."" Growing up with cancer is on BBC One on Monday 26 June at 19:30.
