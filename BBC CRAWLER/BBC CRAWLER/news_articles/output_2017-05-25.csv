Trump avoids diplomatic disaster,"Stern faces but warmer words on Trump's first trip to Nato Donald Trump's motorcade swept through Brussels on a tour of the landmarks of post-war reconstruction that he once seemed to threaten - and diplomatic calamity was averted. It may seem strange to measure the impact of a presidential visit to the EU institutions and Nato simply in terms of faux-pas avoided and false steps not taken but somehow that's the way it is for Mr Trump. The 45th President of the United States found himself immersed for the first time and at first hand in the complexities of the EU. And he discovered that they have sprinkled the title of president rather liberally among the heads of the European Commission, European Council and European Parliament. Even with all those presidential figures on hand in Brussels, it was hard to ignore the feeling that, as European leaders were getting to know the president they must now deal with, they were being offered a tantalising glimpse of the president they preferred. Whether by coincidence or not, Barack Obama was appearing at around the same time 700km (435 miles) down the road at a huge public event in Berlin. Mr Obama had an easier day of it than Mr Trump. Meanwhile, down the road.... He basked in the admiration of a huge crowd at the Brandenburg Gate alongside Chancellor Angela Merkel where they had gathered for a celebration of the strength of the Evangelical Church. Mrs Merkel, said Mr Obama, had done great things for Germany and the world - and it may well be the case that his endorsement will still carry a little weight as the chancellor faces elections later in the year. At around the same time Mr Trump was holding talks with those various European presidents - including Jean-Claude Juncker of the European Commission, who once talked of the need to educate Mr Trump about ""the world he does not know"". No-one took questions after the meeting. Mr Trump said nothing at all and Donald Tusk from the EU Council confined himself to an on-camera statement in which he alluded to one or two areas where it would be hard to disagree - like the importance of fighting terrorism and shared values like freedom and human dignity - but then said enough to suggest that there were plenty of areas where they had not found it hard to disagree. ""Some issues,"" he said, ""remain open like climate and trade. And I'm not 100% sure we can say today that we have a common position, a common opinion about Russia."" Nato and Trump: What future for Atlantic alliance? European angst over Trump visit Trump's view of Europe creates uncertainty Mr Trump's schedule appeared to have been designed to minimise opportunities for press scrutiny, so there was no chance to ask him directly whether he had changed his views on Brexit, which is viewed as a catastrophe in Brussels but which he has described as both ""great"" and ""fantastic"". A news conference would also have presented the president with an opportunity to examine his evolving attitude towards Nato which he has variously described both as ""obsolete"" and ""no longer obsolete"". In the absence of such scrutiny, some reporters devoted themselves to microscopic observation of the Trump body language. This video can not be played Donald Trump met new French President Emmanuel Macron for the first time on Thursday Anyone who followed the discussions during the Middle Eastern section of the tour about whether the first couple were holding hands as they walked in public might care to note that, as they waited at the US embassy residence to greet their lunch guest Emmanuel Macron, they did not stand hand-in-hand but were so close together that their arms were touching. The rather awkward presidential handshake with Mr Macron is a good example of how that kind of scrutiny works. It lasted only a little more than five seconds. While it did look rather over-extended, some reporters spoke of ""knuckles whitening"" and of ""faces tightened"" and one even described it as ""screw-you in handshake form"". Watch the video above and judge for yourselves. When President Trump did finally speak in public towards the end of his day in Brussels, it was worth waiting for. He made a short speech at the magnificent new Nato headquarters building and pointed out rather archly that he had avoided asking how much the palatial new building had cost, even though the alliance's over-reliance on American guns and money is one of his favourite diplomatic themes. But he did not confine himself to that little joke on the subject. Glum Pope and magic orb: Odd moments from Trump's first trip Melania in black at the Vatican. Why? In a blunt address, he said directly that 23 of the 28 Nato members were not paying their fair share towards its costs and warned that was unfair to the American taxpayer - a remark that will surely resonate back home. He also conflated very directly the problem of terrorism with the issue of immigration in a way that very few of his fellow Nato leaders would endorse, but which picked up on one of his favourite campaign themes from last year. This video can not be played In May 2017 Donald Trump pushed aside Montenegro's prime minister and dressed down Nato leaders Here again, though, it seems that Mr Trump's visit may be remembered not for the big politics or the strategic thought but for another curious moment captured on camera and instantly transmitted by social media. As the leaders began to group themselves for the formal summit photograph, Mr Trump appeared to emerge from the back of the pack and firmly push out of the way Dusko Markovic, the prime minister of Montenegro - which is about to join the alliance. The American leader is then seen to draw himself to his full height, ready for the picture. So, certainly no diplomatic disasters on President Trump's first visit to Brussels. He came to give his fellow Nato leaders something to think about and so he did. But something about the president somehow means that he can't help giving everyone something to talk about at the same time.

Reality Check: Migration to the UK,"Net migration to the UK has fallen to about 248,000 in 2016, down 84,000 from the previous year, according toofficial estimates from the Office for National Statistics,external(ONS). Net migration is the number of people who have moved to the UK for at least a year minus the number who have left. The ONS said the fall was due to more people leaving, especially EU citizens, as well as fewer people arriving. Immigration to the UK is estimated to be 588,000 - 250,000 EU citizens, 264,000 non-EU citizens and 74,000 British citizens. At the same time, an estimated 339,000 people left the country: 134,000 British, 117,000 EU and 88,000 non-EU citizens. About half of the EU migrants came from the original West European EU countries: France Germany Italy Belgium The Netherlands Luxembourg Denmark Ireland Greece Spain Portugal Austria Finland Sweden A further 19%, 48,000 people, came from the eight countries that joined the EU in 2004, which the ONS said was the lowest estimate recorded: Poland Czech Republic Slovakia Hungary Slovenia Latvia Lithuania Estonia The remaining 27% came from Romania and Bulgaria, the two countries that joined the EU in 2007, but have been allowed to seek employment in the UK freely only since 2014. The reasons for coming to the UK vary, but most of the EU migrants who came in 2016 said their main reason for coming was either to take a job they had secured before they arrived or to look for a job. On the other hand, most of the non-EU migrants said they had come to study, join family members already in the UK or accompany family members. The migrants that arrived in 2016 joined an estimated 5.567 million citizens of other countries already living in the UK in 2015. According to theONS 2015 figures,external, nine in every 100 people living in the UK were non-British. Of these, the number of EU citizens is estimated at 3.2 million, or five in every 100, and the number of non-EU citizens at 2.4 million, or four in every 100. How has the proportion of EU and non-EU nationals in the UK changed over the past 15 years? In 2001, the proportion of the EU citizens living in the UK was considerably lower - one per 100. The proportion of non-EU citizens - at three per 100 - was also lower than now. But by 2011 the proportion of EU citizens living in the UK had risen sharply. In 2001, the top non-British nationality living in the UK was Irish, with 402,000. The second was Indian, with 147,000, followed by the US, with 119,000. The number of Polish nationals was 38,000, Romanian 5,000 and Lithuanian 7,000. The situation had changed dramatically by 2015: Polish citizens topped the list with 916,000, followed by Indian citizens on 362,000. Irish nationals are now the third biggest non-British group, with an estimated 332,000 living in the UK in 2015. Romanian nationals are now the fourth biggest nation, with 233,000 citizens. Lithuanian migrants are now the eighth biggest non-British group in the UK, with an estimated 170,000 citizens. There has been a notable increase in the number of migrants from the older EU member states too: Portugal, Italy, France, Germany and Spain, as well as some non-EU countries, including Pakistan, China and Nigeria.

The sex slaves of al-Shabab,"When Salama Ali started investigating the disappearance of two younger brothers last year she made an awful discovery - not only were radicalised young Kenyan men leaving to join the al-Shabab militants in neighbouring Somalia, but women were being seized and trafficked by the group as sex slaves. Salama's search for information about her brothers had to be carried out quietly and confidentially, as any hint of a connection with the al-Qaeda-linked al-Shabab can arouse the suspicion of the security forces. So she met discreetly with other women in Mombasa and the surrounding area, sharing stories and seeking information about male relatives who had vanished. ""We discovered there were lots of us,"" Salama says. But Salama also uncovered something very different - stories of women who had been taken to Somalia against their will. The women were both young and old, from Christian and Muslim communities, from Mombasa and other parts of Kenya's coastal region. They were usually promised high-paid work in another town or abroad, and then kidnapped. Last September Salama trained as a counsellor and set up a secret support group for returning women. Word spread and soon women began seeking her out and asking to join the group. This video can not be played ""When we meet we build trust,"" Salama says Some arrived with babies, she says, some with HIV, and some with mental illness caused by their experiences. All are terrified to speak openly, because of the risk of being mistakenly identified as an al-Shabab sympathiser. In a dark room with the curtains drawn, I meet this extraordinary group of women, who have a story that has never been told. ""Men used to come and have sex with me - I can't tell you the number,"" says one, shaking her head as she recounts her ordeal.  ""For those three years, every man was coming to sleep with me."" ""They'd bring two or three men for each woman every night,"" says another. ""We would be raped repeatedly."" Some women were forced to become the ""wives"" of al-Shabab militants, it appears, while others were held as slaves in a brothel. In the UK you can watch theSex Slaves of al-Shababon Our World, on the BBC News Channel at 21:30 on Sunday 28 May, oron the BBC iPlayer(UK only) Viewers overseas can watch it on BBC World News -click here for transmission times On radio the programme can be heard on Assignment, on the BBC World Service, from Thursday 25 May -click here for transmission times Al-Shabab is fighting to create a fundamentalist Islamic state in Somalia and has launched attacks on neighbouring countries, which have all sent troops to fight them as part of an African Union force. Kenya has borne the brunt of al-Shabab's counter-attacks, and the Kenyan army is hunting fighters in the thick Boni Forest that straddles the border with Somalia. Flying over it, you can see lines cut through it - narrow pathways that militants apparently use for transport. The BBC has spoken to more than 20 women and all talk of being held in a thick forest or transported through it. This is most likely to be Boni. This video can not be played The forest where women say they were held by al-Shabab One new member of Salama's group, Faith, has only recently escaped captivity. She was 16 when she was approached by an elderly couple and offered a job in Malindi, further up the coast. Desperate for work, the next day she boarded a bus with 14 other passengers and all were given drugged water to drink. ""When we regained consciousness, there were two men inside the room,"" Faith says. ""They blindfolded us with black scarves. They raped us in that room."" Drugged again, Faith woke up in a small clearing in a dark forest and was told she would be killed if she tried to escape. Terrified, she spent the next three years alone cooking for a group of Somali men ""with long long beards"". She had also become pregnant, as a result of being raped, and had to deliver her own child alone in the forest. ""My grandmother was a traditional midwife, so I had a little bit of knowledge,"" she says. ""Everything I was doing in that forest was alone, so I just had to get out this baby alone."" Faith finally managed to escape with her daughter when a traditional healer foraging for medicinal roots in the forest came across her and showed her the way out. Her child, who grew up naked in the forest, now finds it hard to adapt to city life and struggles to fall asleep at night unless she is outside in her mother's arms. Faith and her daughter She grew accustomed to ""living like we were animals in the forest"", Faith says. A number of the women who spoke to the BBC had given birth in captivity. Sarah, the wife of a former al-Shabab fighter, says this is no coincidence. There is an organised programme to breed the next generation of fighters, she says, as it's hard to recruit people to live in camps in Somalia, and children are easy to indoctrinate. ""In my camp, there [were] women who are sent to come and recruit other women,"" Sarah says. ""They want to multiply so they just want women to give birth."" Most of the 300 women in her camp were Kenyan, she says. Salama also provides support to those who have lost family members, including Elizabeth, who last saw her sister two years ago, before she left for what she thought was a job in Saudi Arabia. A month later, she called. ""She told us she was in a dangerous and bad place in Somalia, in an al-Shabab camp,"" says Elizabeth. The line broke - and her sister has not been heard from since. The Kenyan government acknowledges there is a problem but Evans Achoki, the county commissioner in Mombasa, says it's hard to judge the scale of it, because the women won't come forward. While there is an amnesty programme for fighters returning from Somalia, and some have been rehabilitated, there are also reports of men who have suddenly disappeared, or been shot dead. ""People fear the government,"" says Sureya Hersi of Sisters Without Borders, a network of Kenyan organisations working to counter radical extremism in Kenya's coastal region. ""Those who went there willingly and unwillingly are both looked at as guilty.""

Is heroin being smuggled on Pakistani planes into Heathrow?,"Heroin was found on two PIA flights to London (File photo) Pakistan's national carrier says it is taking measures to ensure its planes are not used to carry drugs after heroin was found on two of its London-bound aircraft. Aviation authorities are also investigating how the drugs might be making their way on to the planes of Pakistan International Airlines (PIA). On 15 May, UK's Border Force officialsimpounded a PIA flight from Islamabadon arrival at London Heathrow airport and searched it for several hours. The National Crime Agency later said that a quantity of heroin had been found hidden in different panels of the plane. Incidents happened on flights headed to London's Heathrow airport There were suggestions that the British authorities had acted on a tip-off from Pakistan. No-one was charged. The pilot was allowed to return to Pakistan the next day, while the crew members were given their passports back a day later. The episode caused considerable embarrassment to PIA, which was already reeling from a planecrash in that killed dozens of people in Decemberand a number of near-misses subsequently, sparking allegations of corruption and mismanagement. Then on 22 May, Pakistani officials at Islamabad airport seized more than 20kg (44lb) of heroin from another aircraft headed to Heathrow. An investigation is continuing. The mysterious case of the drug-smuggling fishermen Why I bought my daughter heroin Investigations were launched to identify suspects within the PIA and the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) with possible links to a drug trafficking ring that may have been using PIA to smuggle the drug abroad, Mashhood Tajwar, a PIA spokesman, told the BBC. The investigation is being conducted by a team of officials from airport security, customs and the anti-narcotics force (ANF). Mr Tajwar said pre-flight searches of aircrafts had been a part of standard operating procedures in the past, but surveillance had been stepped up since the May incident at Heathrow. On Friday, a high-level meeting presided by the prime minister's adviser on aviation, Mehtab Ahmad Khan, finalised new security measures and a Central Operational Committee headed by the CAA chief was constituted to oversee their implementation. On Monday, four aircraft expected to fly to foreign destinations were scheduled for checking, one of which - as mentioned above - was carrying drugs. This is not the first time drugs have been found on PIA planes. Last December, 17kg (37lb) of heroin was seized by officials at Karachi airport from a plane being readied for a flight to Jeddah, in Saudi Arabia. The flight was delayed for over 11 hours as a result. WATCH: 'Cold turkey' only option for Karachi's addicts Poppy crops are still found in large parts of Afghanistan Pre-flight checks are part of routine procedure and sniffer dogs are regularly used to clear aircraft for operations, PIA officials say. But the presence of heroin on some aircraft shows that officials responsible for such checks may either have been complacent or linked to drug mules among employees. While poppy crops across Pakistan have largely been eliminated, it is still grown in large parts of southern Afghanistan where insurgent groups wield influence and officials have little power. Analysts say poppy and heroin are among the main sources of income for these groups. And since some of them are said to have the tacit support of Pakistani authorities, they are said to be able to enter the country and smuggle heroin into Pakistan for onward shipment to the West. Such smuggling is further helped by large-scale movement of Afghan refugees across the Pakistan-Afghanistan border, experts say. Pakistan International Airlines has also courted controversy recently for other reasons. In February its management was accused of trying to cover up an air safety breach when itboarded seven extra passengers on a flight from Karachi to Medina, Saudi Arabia. They were allowed to stand in the aisle during the flight. In April, a passengers photographed thechief pilot of a London-bound flight taking a nap,externalin the passenger compartment, leaving the controls in the hands of a first officer and a trainee pilot. The pilot denied he had breached safety rules, but the PIA management said they were investigating the incident. In early May, another pilot on a flight from Tokyo was accused ofallowing an unauthorised foreign national into the cockpit,external. The passenger, a Chinese woman, remained there for two hours during the Tokyo-Beijing leg of the flight. The incident was filmed by a journalist who was traveling on the same flight. In 2013 a PIA pilot who admitted beingover the legal alcohol limit to flyafter being arrested in the cockpit was jailed for nine months in the UK.

Waiting for take-off in West Africa,"International airlines dominate air travel in West Africa Flying between the West African capitals of Freetown and Banjul should take about an hour. But as the BBC's Umaru Fofana found out, because of the region's poor air connections, it can be quicker and easier to fly via Morocco or Belgium, although that could take a day, or even three. I recently had to travel to The Gambia on a reporting trip for the BBC. In theory, this journey of 700km (400 miles) should take about an hour and The Gambia is a popular tourist destination, which is served by charter flights from across Europe. But there are just two flights a week from Freetown and the days didn't fit with my trip. One option would have been to fly with Royal Air Maroc via Casablanca, where there can be a stopover of 30 hours with no automatic entitlement to hotel accommodation. So it is actually quicker, but far more expensive, to fly to Belgium's capital Brussels and then connect to Banjul. That ""only"" takes 24 hours. Another option would have been with Air Cote D'Ivoire, a relatively new kid on the aviation block. This would have meant flying via its hub in Abidjan, then to Dakar and onward to Banjul. However, I would have needed to stay overnight in Abidjan, and possibly another night in Dakar to be able catch Brussels Airlines which is virtually the only reliable means of flying to Banjul from the Senegalese capital. So a total journey time of about three days. In the end, the best option was to drive from Freetown to Conakry, before flying to Dakar, Senegal's capital, where I spent the night to get my connecting flight to Banjul the following day. I spent two days travelling for a trip that should have taken me just over an hour. My return leg was even more exhausting. I flew from Banjul to Dakar, spent the night and flew on the next evening to Conakry. I had to spend another night in Guinea's capital before driving to Freetown on the third day. In Conakry, I met other travellers who were on different legs of their various journeys around West Africa. Most of them were businesspeople who complained about the hassle, saying it made travel more expensive. The introduction of regional airlines like Air Cote D'Ivoire has not fully addressed the challenges ""This has a concomitant effect - the high costs of goods and services,"" lamented a middle-aged retailer from Freetown who buys her goods in Guinea for sale in Bo, southern Sierra Leone. Omodele Jones, a businessman based in The Gambia, told me he had to change his ticket to fly from Banjul via Brussels to Nairobi because his airline had cancelled its flight to Dakar, where he was initially scheduled to connect to the Kenyan capital. ""It would have cost me a lot of time - which is a lot of money - to have waited another two days at least to fly to Nairobi via Dakar,"" Omodele Jones told me. Several African countries established national airlines after independence, mainly focusing on flights to destinations outside the continent. Many of these carriers were propped up financially and protected by regulation, stifling competition and leaving domestic and regional routes undeveloped for a long time. Safety has also been an issue because of comparatively high accident rates, and regulators outside Africa have imposed heavy restrictions. Even some African airlines with good safety records are blocked from flying to the European Union (EU) airports because of a lack of confidence in African safety regulators. Another factor is that some African countries have still not opened up their skies to each other - allowed other countries' carries to use their airports - yet they have opened up to carriers from other continents. As a result, it is often cheaper to fly from an African city via London, Amsterdam, or Dubai and back to a neighbouring African city than to travel direct. Non-African airlines currently fly about 80% of intercontinental traffic to and from Africa. The Single African Air Transport Market (SAATM), a policy of the African Union, is due to be introduced this year. Implementing the SAATM, which is similar to the EU's single aviation market, would go a long way towards making African air travel more competitive by reducing protectionist policies. Nancy Kacungira is presenting the BBC Africa Debate: What will fix Africa's air transport? Listen on the BBC World Service, 1900 GMT on 26 May and afterwardson demand. Half a century after independence, many African countries still have better transport links with their former colonial powers than their neighbours. There are several flights a day from former British colony The Gambia to London, but very few to neighbouring Senegal. Senegal's capital, Dakar, is of course well served with flights to its former colonial master, France. One reason for the lack of flights between major West African cities is the collapse of regional airlines such as Ghana Airways, Air Senegal and many in Nigeria. Some West African states have tried to address this by setting up a new airline, ASKY, based in the Togolese capital, Lome where a massive airport expansion is underway. It was established in 2008 but does not yet connect all West African countries. ASKY airline operates from its hub in Gnassinge Eyadema International airport in Lome, One expert in the aviation industry says the passenger flow in West Africa is ""pretty low"", so it does not make business sense to fly some routes. The man, who did not want to be named, says with ""a more sensible and business-friendly tax regime"" the situation would improve. The Vice-President of KLM Africa, Frank Legre, told journalists in Freetown recently that the cost of a plan ticket to London largely consisted of taxes: ""Let me explain to you about our ticket to London. The ticket cost $825 and our own actual price without tax is $350, which shows that over $500 tax has been levied on the ticket."" While it is true that many West Africans cannot afford to fly, the middle-class is increasing and if prices were lower, more people would develop the habit of flying and so it might become profitable for airlines to link West African cities before too long. In the meantime, the idea of free movement of goods and services as envisioned by the founding heads of state of the regional body Ecowas will remain a pipe-dream.

'I turned my dad's erotic novel into a hit podcast',"Jamie Morton (centre) and friends Alice Levine and James Cooper When Jamie Morton started making his own podcast, he certainly picked an eyebrow-raising topic - reading out his dad's attempts at erotic fiction. Jamie's father had sent him the first few chapters of the racy novel he'd been secretly writing. ""I naively assumed it would be some story of swashbuckling pirates or a spy thriller. It was only when I started reading it that I discovered he'd been penning porn,"" says Jamie, 29. Bodice-ripping sentences he stumbled over included ""the job interviewer had just asked her to remove her jacket and silk blouse"" and ""her black brassiere was working overtime"". Following the initial shock, Jamie decided to read his dad's adult literature to some friends down the pub. They immediately collapsed with laughter and piled in with their comments and critiques. The evening was so much fun that it inspired London-based Jamie to launch a podcast called My Dad Wrote A Porno. Every week he and his friends, James Cooper and Alice Levine, discuss and analyse a different chapter of his father's unintentionally funny book, which is called Belinda Blinked. Since its launch in September 2015 the podcast has been a surprise hit, surpassing 50 million downloads worldwide, and regularly dominating Apple's iTunes podcast chart. Almost a quarter of Americans are said to listen to podcasts, and 10% of people in the UK Listening to podcasts - digital audio files - that you stream or download to your mobile phone or computer has shot up in recent years. The US continues to lead the way, with almost a quarter of Americans over the age of 12 - about 67 million people - now listening to at least one podcast every month, according to thePodcast Consumer 2017 report,externalby Edison Research. The 24% figure compares with just 9% in 2008. Separate figuresshow,externalthat 10% of UK adults are now downloading podcasts, up from 6.5% in autumn 2015. While for many people making their podcast is a happy hobby, for an increasing number - such as Jamie Morton - it can be a very lucrative business. So how can podcast makers make money? With most podcasts being given away for free, the answer is advertising revenues, but if you aren't an expert on the advertising industry, securing adverts may seem like an impossible challenge. Help is at hand from the growing number of podcast platforms that connect podcasters with advertisers. Podcast platforms that offer this service, including Swedish start-up firm Acast and the UK's AudioBoom. Digital music players and the internet have made podcasts possible My Dad Wrote A Porno uses Acast, and Jamie says: ""Acast secures the [advertising] deals, and then we record specific sponsorship reads that we slot into the show."" What Jamie means by ""reads"" is that he or one of his fellow hosts will read out a message from the sponsor of the episode or series. He adds that they then try to make the sponsor ""relevant"" to the show. ""It's a really great way of doing it because it makes them feel fully integrated into the podcast, and we're able to put our personal spin on them, and find editorially relevant ways of weaving sponsorship into the tone of our specific show."" While podcast expert Tom Webster, of research group Edison, agrees that the adverts work best when they ""feel like part of the content"", other commentators have questioned whether such an approach is being fair to the listeners. These critics argue that there should always be a clear delineation between the content and the adverts, so that the listener knows exactly what is commercially paid for.

Just design it yourself Why you need to question your hippo boss In terms of how much money is now spent on podcast advertising, media firm ZenithOptimedia estimated last year that the 2016 figure for the US would be $35m (Â£27m). This is a tiny fraction of the $18bn spent on radio advertising in the US last year, but podcast advertising is growing steadily. While Acast won't reveal exact figures for how much money its users make from advertising, it says that its ""top podcasters can bring in tens of thousands of dollars a month from brands"". Acast's co-founder Karl Rosander adds that podcasters ""can make a very good living if you have a popular show"". Meanwhile, Mr Webster says that to earn serious money, podcast creators need to be achieving more than 100,000 downloads a month. Kristoffer Triumf's podcast has led to other revenue streams In addition to a slice of the advertising revenues, podcasters can also choose to put out ""premium content"", such as special edition episodes that people have to pay for. Podcasting can also lead to other revenue streams. Swedish podcaster Kristoffer Triumf, founder of weekly entertainment industry podcast Varvet, has been able to earn additional money from hosting live talk shows and has even released a spin-off board game. Back at My Dad Wrote A Porno the team has started taking its show on tour. Jamie says: ""Live shows have been a really exciting thing to do, and we're taking our show up to the Edinburgh Fringe later this year, and also embarking on a tour of Australia and New Zealand. ""We sold out the Sydney Opera House in one day, and added an extra night due to the demand, which is incredibly exciting."" But while some podcasters sing the praises of the likes of Acast and AudioBoom, others deliberately avoid them. London-based Imriel Morgan and Efe Jerome run the Shout Out Network, a podcast network dedicated to representing diversity. Its five podcasts include Millennials of Colour, which covers issues from mental health to poverty, and are available via its own website or Apple's Podcast app. Shout Out Network has a number of podcasts, hosted by these presenters Imriel says they prefer to work directly with advertisers so that they can have strict control over what adverts are connected to their podcasts, something she claims isn't possible via Acast or AudioBoom. ""We have had a few meetings with Acast and AudioBoom and have opted not to go with them,"" says Imriel. ""We think their method isn't suited to our audience. They monetise content and place ads next to your content - I don't want ads on the content that we haven't listened to before. ""For example, we are happy to advertise, say cars and health products, but [with those platforms] you don't know what that brand might be. We are completely against that. We have a lot of trust with our listeners."" AudioBoom agrees that trust is all-important - which is why the firm disagrees strongly that its podcasters have no control over adverts. ""We don't want a podcaster to promote a brand they don't truly support,"" says Ruth Fitzsimons, AudioBoom's senior vice president of international operations. ""That's bad business for advertisers and it erodes the trust our podcast partners work so hard to build with their audiences."" AudioBoom's way of working is that new podcasters fill in an ""advertising restrictions list"" which outlines the genres and brands they are not willing to work with. Says Ms Fitzsimons: ""This is particularly important for live reads which are endorsements made by hosts and producers based on their experience with a product or service."" AudioBoom's in-house research certainly underlines why advertisers are interested in this medium. A survey of 2,646 AudioBoom podcast listeners completed in March found that 40% had bought, tried or researched a product mentioned by a podcaster. For anyone wishing to start a podcast, Jamie Morton says it is crucial to find an original angle if you want it to be a success. ""It's such a saturated marketplace and because anyone can make a podcast there's a lot of competition,"" he says. He adds that making money should definitely not be your prime concern. ""I think with anything creative, if you set out making something to earn money from it it's probably not going to work out that well.""

Police officers have to 'venture into hell',"Ch Supt John Sutherland says the impact of terrorist attacks on police officers is not yet understood A senior police officer who suffered a mental illness after years of witnessing trauma says the impact of horrific events such as the Manchester attacks on the emergency services has yet to be fully understood. ""We ask police to go to the places the rest of us couldn't or wouldn't and we ask them to do it repeatedly,"" Ch Supt John Sutherland tells theVictoria Derbyshire programme. ""For 25 years I've watched colleagues do those things with extraordinary compassion and they do it so beautifully, but I don't think we've even begun to understand the impact it has on them to be exposed to repeated trauma."" The senior Metropolitan Police officer knows from personal experience just how serious the impact can be. In 2013, after years serving as a frontline police officer, Ch Supt John Sutherland began to feel unwell. He went on to suffer severe anxiety, depression and crippling exhaustion. After going to see his GP, he was given emergency counselling, prescribed anti-depressants and signed off work. It has taken him years to come to terms with his breakdown, which he says was caused by the trauma of dealing with the impact of horrific crimes, including murders and terror attacks. Now, when terror attacks such as the ones in Manchester and Westminster take place, Ch Supt Sutherland says he ""struggles"" to deal with the extensive news coverage. ""It's the simple trauma of it,"" he says. ""I can't look at the pictures or read much of the coverage because I care too much. ""The second thing I struggle with is my inability to respond in the ways I used to be able to. It is a survivors' guilt type thing, knowing my colleagues are in there in the thick of it but if I was to even try I would be more unhelpful than helpful like offering personal support on the front line or visiting."" Bombs exploded on three Tube trains and a bus during the 7/7 attacks Ch Supt Sutherland was a serving officer during the 7/7 attacks, when four suicide bombers killed 52 people in central London and injured more than 700. He was also at the scene of the failed 21/7 attacks, when failed bombers targeted three London Underground trains and a bus in an attempted repeat attack. Since then, he has worked directly with colleagues who were first on the scene of 7/7 and the murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby. ""The reality is police officers venture into hell and they see things and deal with things and have to make choices that are beyond the comprehension of most of us,"" he says. But that bravery can come at a cost. ""From my experience of being at murder scenes, what I understand now is that it would be impossible to venture into those places and not be affected by it. We'd be something less than human if we didn't feel something. ""I didn't understand until years later the extent of the impact of what had I'd experienced and had happened to me,"" he says. ""It was no single thing for me that suddenly caught up on me after 22 years, it was cumulative."" He has now chronicled his illness and the causes of it in a book, called A Life in Blue: a Memoir. ""As a society we have yet to fully understand the effect of repeated exposure to trauma on police,"" he says. Hundreds of police and emergency service staff attended the Manchester Arena attack Ch Supt Sutherland, who now works in a non-operational role for London's Metropolitan Police, says his experiences during his career were just ""normal"" for a police officer. But he says ""we don't all react and respond in the same ways"". ""If my story was about anything other than mental health, if it was about being shot or stabbed I'd feel no shame at all and would feel proud of myself and people's reaction would be one of equivocation. There would be a wound I could show, but mental health doesn't show up on x-rays. ""I felt desperately ashamed early on about mental illness and some of the bloke stuff of not being strong, that I'd fallen over when colleagues were still on duty - whilst I was curled up at home unable to move."" This week - following the atrocity in Manchester - the terror level in the UK was raised to critical, its highest level. It means another terror attack could be ""imminent"". He says that alone places an additional burden on the Met's police officers. ""It is also the realisation that every police officer is an explicit terrorist target. It's in your subconscious,"" he says. ""That places an enormous burden, but you won't find a single officer batting an eyelid or complaining at all. They do what they do best in these circumstances and get on with it proudly."" Watch theVictoria Derbyshire programmeon weekdays between 09:00 and 11:00 on BBC Two and the BBC News channel.

Standard's deputy moves to Mail Online,"Former Chancellor George Osborne became editor of the Standard earlier this month There's been a lot of ""fair play, George Osborne"" on Twitter in recent days, commending him for breaking a series of agenda-setting political stories. There was the line about how not a single member of the cabinet supports the prime minister's immigration cap, followed by the scoop about her swivel on social care. Given his 20 years in politics, including six as chancellor, by my calculation Mr Osborne has roughly 17,000 further scoops in his head, with which he will no doubt be entertaining readers ofthe Standard,externalin weeks to come. He has had a very lively news agenda in his first weeks as an editor, with not just the election and now the horror in Manchester, a city he championed, with a constituency nearby, but also Donald Trump's novel experiments in modern public administration. The tougher test will come when, inevitably, the news agenda is quieter - perhaps in August, for instance. Alas for him, his news supremo, deputy editor Ian Walker (one of two deputies on the paper, together with Charlotte Ross, who overseas Features and ES Magazine), is leaving. I can reveal that Walker is heading toMail Online,,externalwhere he has been appointed executive editor by Martin Clarke, Mail Online's editor. Walker, who worked with Clarke years ago, will focus on the news operation. After nearly 17 years at the Standard, he is leaving despite, and not because of, Mr Osborne's sprightly entry into journalism. He will start the new role in September. Six priorities for George Osborne Walker's departure doesn't strictly create a vacancy at the Standard, where an internal solution is likely to be found. At Mail Online, Walker will spend less time thinking about London, but more time responding to howls of outrage on social media. Search for ""Daily Mail"" on Twitter and you'll see a range of stories in the aftermath of the Manchester terror attack that have met with fury. Of course, it's in the nature of social media that we hear more from those who are angry about a particular story than those who agree with it. And these controversies tend to have one effect above all, which is to increase web traffic for the world's most widely read English-language website. Walker is entering a new world and his appointment is a signal that Mail Online is serious about breaking hard news stories, as well as generating traffic through its notorious sidebar of shame.

Man Utd target three or four signings,"Jose Mourinho told executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward his targets two months ago Manchester United are likely to limit their summer spending to three or four key signings. United will be in the Champions League and boss Jose Mourinho said executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward has had his targets ""for more than two months"". Mourinho wants to enhance his forward and defensive options to challenge for the Premier League title next season. United have been linked with Atletico Madrid striker Antoine Griezmann and Burnley centre-back Michael Keane. ""Ed Woodward has my list,"" the Portuguese manager said after his side beat Ajax to win the Europa League for the first time on Wednesday. ""Now it's up to him and the owners."" Rooney has 'more or less' decided future 'A season-defining game in the shadow of tragedy' 'Mourinho can look back on outstanding season' Griezmannhas a 100m euro release clause in his contract and the 26-year-old France internationalsaid earlier this weekthat his chances of joining United were ""six out of 10"". Since then, a major stumbling block has been removed by United securing the return of Champions League football. They will go straight into the group stage after their victory over Ajax in Stockholm. Griezmann has the pace and trickery United lack but, should a move falter, Torino forwardAndrea Belottiis another option. The 23-year-old Italy international has scored 25 goals in Serie A this season. Griezmann has scored 15 goals in 41 appearances for France Keane,meanwhile, left United for Burnley in January 2015 butMourinho is known to be eagerto bring the 24-year-old defender back to Old Trafford. The Portuguese views predecessor Louis van Gaal's decision to sell the centre-back for Â£2m as a mistake and believes his central defensive options are limited. In theory, a 25% sell-on clause agreed at the time of that deal should bring the price down. However, Burnley manager Sean Dyche has said the Claretshave no financial need to sell,externalKeane, who made his England debut in March. Prior to the January transfer window, United showed interest in Benfica's Sweden centre-backVictor Lindelof,22, while left-back is another area of weakness. Earning Champions League football means United have avoided the potential loss of Â£50m in sponsorship income and prize money. However, one senior club source said the forthcoming transfer window was likely to be ""crazy"", given the increased spending power within the Premier League as a result of the new Â£8.3bn TV deal and clubs such as Inter Milan and AC Milan willing to spend big to try to rediscover former glories. A year ago, Mourinho marked his first summer at Old Trafford by bringing in striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic, defender Eric Bailly and midfielder Henrikh Mkhitaryan by the first week in July, beforemidfielder Paul Pogba re-signed from Juventusfor a world record Â£89m in early August. In December,BBC Sport was toldthe United manager felt he needed at least two more transfer windows to shape his squad. Mourinho decided not to buy in January, but since then Ibrahimovic and defender Marcos Rojo have suffered cruciate knee-ligament injuries which will keep them out until next year and former Germany midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger has left for Major League Soccer in the United States. United went on to finish sixth in the Premier League which, apart from the disastrous campaign under David Moyes in 2013-14, was their lowest placing since 1991.

Rooney has 'more or less' decided future,"Substitute Wayne Rooney looks on from the sidelines during Manchester United's Europa League final victory Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney says he has ""more or less"" decided his future at the club. The 31-year-old has played a bit-part role for United this season, coming on as a last-minute substitute in the Europa League final triumph over Ajax. ""There's lots of offers on the table, both in England and abroad,"" he said. But United's all-time leading scorer with 253 goals said he would only move to former club Everton if he stayed in the Premier League. It is understood Rooney does not want the issue to drag on until the final day of the transfer window on 31 August, and he will go away with his family to discuss and decide on his next course of action. Rooney has ruled out playing for any other Premier League side apart from Everton, while Toffees managerRonald Koemanand director of footballSteve Walsh,externalhave both said publicly this season they would be interested in the player should he become available. Rooney joined the Old Trafford clubfor Â£27m in 2004,externaland has gone on to play more than 550 games, breaking Sir Bobby Charlton's 44-year goalscoring record this season. But he has only started 15 league games this term and failed to play in the EFL Cup final victory over Southampton at Wembley. Rooney's dwindling Premier League appearances Games played Minutes Games started Sub appearances 2016-17 25 1,539 15 10 2015-16 28 2,410 27 1 2014-15 33 2,876 33 0 2013-14 29 2,448 27 2 He is also England's all-time leading scorer with 53 goals, but has been left out ofGareth Southgate's latest squadfor the World Cup qualifier against Scotland on 10 June and the friendly against France three days later. ""Of course you want to play,"" said Rooney. ""You want to be on the pitch. I think a younger me would have been a lot more frustrated. I think I understand what's right and what's needed for the club, and I respect that. ""Obviously I am happy to be part of that [Europa League win] and in some way help the club win trophies, and that is the way it's been over the last 18 months and last year. ""That is a decision I have to make now, whether I want to continue doing that or go on and play more regular football."" BBC Sport's Simon Stone looks at the player's options: As with John Terry at Chelsea, Rooney appears to have slowly been eased out of the first-team, without there being one single pressure point that signalled a change in Mourinho's thinking. It felt like a poignant moment when Rooney waved to both ends of Old Trafford as he was given a standing ovation after being substituted two minutes from the end of Manchester United's final game of the Premier League season on Saturday. Then, on an emotional night in Stockholm, he came on as a 90th-minute substitute to rapturous applause and was front and centre in the celebrations that followed United's Europa League final victory over Ajax. Was this really a final goodbye for the club's record goalscorer? This video can not be played Wayne Rooney goes top of England goalscoring chart Rooney announced in August 2016 that the 2018 World Cup would be his last international tournament - England are well placed to qualify, being four points clear at the top of the group having played half of their 10 games. Already England's highest goalscorer, with 53, and most-capped outfield player with 119, if Rooney can force his way back into Southgate's plans for the finals in Russia, he would almost certainly eclipse Peter Shilton's overall record of 125 appearances. In addition, he would become the first England international to have played at four World Cups and the first to have played in seven major tournaments. Rooney is aware of the milestone and, having committed so much time to his England career since making his debut against Australia in February 2003, it would not be dismissed lightly. But, after Southgate did not pick Rooney for the World Cup qualifier with Slovenia in October, he dropped the striker altogether for the matches against Lithuania and Germany in March. So does this latest omission now take the England dimension out of Rooney's thinking altogether? Rooney remains available for England and does not feel he has a right to be picked. And the international door cannot be regarded as completely closed yet. Rooney only played one game between 1 February and 1 April because of injury. And Southgate has already shown that age is no barrier - he picked striker Jermain Defoe, who is three years older than the Manchester United man and had not played for England since November 2013, back in March. Evidently, to be considered for selection, Rooney must beplaying regularly and in form- according to Southgate, certainly more than just five starts in games with little at stake but pride. It is also worth noting that the only player to play for England whilst being at a club outside Europe is David Beckham, who played 14 times between August 2007 and October 2009 while being at Major League Soccer outfit LA Galaxy and a further five times in 2009 when on loan from the Galaxy to AC Milan. Beckham never played in a major tournament during his time with the Galaxy as England failed to qualify for Euro 2008 and he was ruled out of the 2010 World Cup after rupturing his Achilles tendon. 'A season defining game in shadow of tragedy' - Phil McNulty on Man Utd Rooney left out of England squad Manchester football clubs donate Â£1m to attack victims' fund At the start of the season, United boss Jose Mourinho talked up Rooney as ""my man"", saying ""the best is yet to come"" from his captain. And immediately after the Ajax victory Mourinho was still insisting he would be ""happy"" for a ""very important"" Rooney to stay next season. Rooney, 31, finished the campaign with a run of five Premier League starts - yet this was the first time since the very start of the season. And that run of games came with Mourinho calling them ""just matches we do not want to play"" as he publically prioritised the Europa League campaign. Before the Europa League semi-final against Celta Vigo at Old Trafford, it was interesting to see Rooney appear at the press conference. Both club and player knew he would be asked about his future at United, with each side knowing the answer needed to be a political one to avoid the potential for negative headlines. Rooney's answers were largely neutral. When pushed, he did say his preference would be to stay at United and play for them, but, under the circumstances, it would be difficult for him to suggest anything else. Rooney accepts he is not going to start every game and moving on is not straightforward. It would be a wrench for him to leave a club he joined as a teenager in 2004. He still has two seasons left on a contract worth Â£13m-a-year - which is difficult to see any club outside the top six in England matching, or even getting close. Other than Real Madrid, Barcelona and Bayern Munich, the same is also true on mainland Europe, while in the US - another suggested destination - the highest paid player in Major League Soccer is Brazilian forward Kaka, who earns $7.167m (Â£5.51m). That's less of an issue for clubs in the Chinese Super League - according to documents released recently by Football Leaks, Argentina's Ezequiel Lavezzi is the game's biggest earner, on a wage of Â£798,000-a-week - Â£41.5m-a-year - at Hebei China Fortune. But even Chinese clubs are starting to reign in their spending. From those figures, any move away from Old Trafford for Rooney, other than to China, could get complicated and raise the potential for United having to pay part of his contract to make a deal financially viable. Rooney's long-time adviser Paul Stretford held talks with Chinese Super League club Tianjin Quanjian earlier in the season. He travelled to China, where he has business interests through his Red Lantern digital media company, which has an office in Beijing, to see if he could complete a transfer prior to the Chinese Super League transfer deadline closing on 28 February. Nothing could be concluded, but it is understood interest in signing Rooney in China is strong due to his high-profile and huge commercial value. Chinese Super League clubs are allowed to pick three overseas players in their matchday squads, although they are allowed to sign four. Currently, the only two clubs who do not have four overseas players are Jiangsu Suning, who have the same owners as Inter Milan, and Liaoning Whowin. Is this realistic though for both parties? Rooney would potentially be the only Englishman in the league, far from home and China is introducing new rules discouraging spending on high-profile stars when their summer transfer window opens on 19 June. Though they live in an exclusive part of Cheshire, Rooney and wife Coleen retain strong links to their Liverpool roots. Their three children were born in the city, both sets of parents and extended family still live there. Leaving, undoubtedly, would be a wrench. The MLS has worked for former England team-mates Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard, as well as Ashley Cole, who still plays for LA Galaxy. Former United team-mate Bastian Schweinsteiger is playing well for Chicago Fire, although the money is a lot less. There are eight MLS teams who currently have space in their three-man 'Designated Player' roster. Galaxy, whose big spending included the arrival of David Beckham, were prepared to make changes to their squad during the summer transfer window so they could sign Zlatan Ibrahimovic from Manchester United and make him the highest-paid player in MLS history. However, it is understood they have no interest in signing Rooney as an alternative to the Swede, who will miss the remainder of the year after rupturing cruciate ligaments. ""Once a blue, always a blue"" - Wayne Rooney's testimonial for Manchester United against boyhood club Everton at Old Trafford in August 2016 In June 2016, when Rooney announced a planned testimonial against his only other professional club - and the one he supported as a boy - Everton, Rooney made a significant statement. He said: ""Manchester United and Everton are the only clubs I have played for as a professional footballer. I am happy to say now that, whatever may happen in the future, I will never play for another Premier League club."" Rooney has never gone back on those words - and there has been no indication from anyone close to him that the position has changed. But if he was drafting a testimonial statement now, would it be so definitive? When he issued the statement, Rooney had come back from injury to start United's final eight games of the season, including the FA Cup final and semi-final, and was about to captain England at Euro 2016. At that point there was no reason to believe he would be looking at moving - to Everton or anywhere else - until after the 2018 World Cup at the earliest. Mourinho has said of Rooney, and other players, that he would not prevent him leaving United if that was what he wanted. In February, manager Ronald Koeman said Rooney ""would be welcome"" at Everton. Rooney remains one of the most marketable players in the game and his presence at Goodison Park would help open commercial doors Everton's ambitious owner Farhad Moshiri knows would be useful in his attempts to gatecrash the current top six. Equally though, Koeman may not see the same value in signing a player who will be 32 in October and has been through so many demanding seasons at the highest level for club and country since making the last of his 77 Everton appearances against Manchester City in May 2004. By sticking with his 'no-one but United and Everton in the Premier League' stance, Rooney would be closing off the likes of West Ham, West Brom and Stoke who have either bought experienced players to further their cause in the past, or have managers who are adept at doing so. ""I've got decisions to make now over the next few weeks, have a word with my family, and then I'll decide,"" Rooney said in the aftermath of Wednesday's Europa League final. ""I think I just have to make a decision in terms of a football decision, and that's what I'll do.""

Nato and Trump: What future for Atlantic alliance?,"President Trump wants Nato to become more involved in the fight against jihadist group Islamic State This is like no other Nato summit, but then there has been no other US president quite like Donald Trump. Never has there been a man in the White House - commander-in-chief of the most powerful military player in the alliance - who, at least on the campaign trail, described the organisation as ""obsolete"". Mr Trump - unlike his predecessors - is not a man steeped in the orthodoxy of the trans-Atlantic partnership. He may now havereversed his positionon Nato's obsolescence, but he tends to see things in transactional terms and it's clear that he still wonders if the US is getting a good deal from its Nato partners. Indeed Nato officials are playing down any use of the term ""summit"" at all. I understand that Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg is seeking a proper, full-scale summit in 2018. Nato hit by Turkish veto on Austria partnership Turkey row: Why has Erdogan riled Nato allies? This Brussels meeting is a brief affair; in large part a ceremonial occasion with a dinner attached. Two monuments will be unveiled and a ribbon will be cut marking the opening of the as-yet-unfinished new Nato headquarters. ""It's all a bit unscripted and very light on substance,"" commented one Nato insider. ""It's all about creating an atmosphere - hopefully we will get a couple of good presidential tweets."" Nato's new HQ is being officially opened on Thursday For all the uncertainties about President Trump's position, in many ways the Atlantic alliance is in good health: Its Afghan advise-and-assist mission continues, underscoring its role in stabilisation and counter-terrorism It has despatched a small number of military units to its eastern flank to reassure the nervous Baltic States and Poland, who fear further Russian land-grabs after the annexation of Crimea from Ukraine US tanks are back in Western Europe, adding to the deterrent effect It is still taking in members - Montenegro will be present at this leaders' meeting for the first time, though it only formally joins the alliance in June In public opinion terms, positive opinions about Nato are on the rise in Alliance countries, according toa recent opinion poll by the Pew Research Center,external But the shiny and unfinished new headquarters building is a kind of metaphor for the state of the alliance as a whole. All appearances are of vitality and unquestioned relevance: an alliance capable of carrying out old missions like deterring against a resurgent Russian threat while grappling with the new - instability, terrorism and cyber-war. Beneath the surface there is still a good deal of unfinished business and uncertainty about the way ahead. Anti-Nato protesters took to the streets of Brussels on Wednesday There are arguments about resources and future missions; there are fissures opening up between members; and fundamental questions as to whether many of the ""new"" security challenges really fall within the remit of Nato at all. Resources have taken up much of the limelight - not least because Mr Trump, like every recent president before him, insists that Washington's allies must spend more. The alliance has anchored itself to the benchmark goal that 2% of a country's GDP should go on defence spending. A few are already there. Some are on the way to this goal; many are certainly spending more. But there are still huge doubts as to how far this is really generating additional military capability at a time when technology is changing quickly and the need for rapidly deployable forces is growing. Washington wants Nato to be even more involved in counter-terrorism and the struggle against so-called Islamic State. Many Nato members fear getting embroiled in ""another Afghanistan"" Nato does a lot of work with partners on building defence capacity and reforming security structures. It has helped with training in Iraq and Jordan and so on. But the Americans want Nato to join the anti-IS coalition as Nato: most of its members already have seats at the table. The plan seems likely to go ahead with Nato advance warning and control systems and tanker aircraft playing a more active role in the air campaign. At least at the European end of the alliance, there is a fear in some quarters as to where this may all lead. Could Nato allies become embroiled in a post-conflict Iraq or indeed in Libya, just as they appear stuck in Afghanistan? At root, though, there is another problem. Many of the ""new"" challenges - cyber; theRussian disinformation campaign waged against Western societies; ""grey-zone"" warfare combining elements of both, along with military power (as seen in Ukraine) - are not entirely or even exclusively the remit of a military or diplomatic organisation. Russian hackers have been blamed for hacking the US Democratic National Committee and the German parliament There is a military dimension of course, but these are as much matters of civil resilience for private industry and institutions as they are for government. Nato does not have a central role. There are also internal strains within the alliance. The broad difference in emphasis has been managed up to now between northern member-states, whose chief worry is Russia, and those in the south, on Nato's Mediterranean coast, who see the wider instability in the Middle East as the prime threat. But Turkey'sdrift towards authoritarianismand itsflirtation with Russiawarn of potential problems ahead on the alliance's southern flank. Nato clearly still has a role both as a diplomatic forum and as a provider of military punch when needed. But huge questions still remain about its capacity, enthusiasm and appetite for effective nation-building in conflict zones; a problem, in fairness, that all major international institutions are grappling with.

'A season-defining game in the shadow of tragedy',"United's Europa League victory means they will be playing in next season's Champions League Jose Mourinho's first season at Manchester United came down to one game at Stockholm's superbly appointed Friends Arena - a game played in the shadow of tragedy but still a game that would define how he and his team's season would be viewed. If Manchester United had lost to Ajax in the Europa League final, sixth place in the Premier League and an EFL Cup win would count as a failure given expectations and expenditure after he was appointed as Louis van Gaal's successor. If United won Mourinho would be seen once more as the man who guarantees success, with two major trophies secured and a place back at European football's top table next season in the Champions League. Mourinho and United took the winning option, overpowering a talented but lightweight Ajax to give their season and thousands of celebrating fans a warmer glow. It also provided a city in mourning with cause for a measured and respectful outpouring of joy after 22 people died and many more were injured in Monday's terror attack at the Ariana Grande concert at the Manchester Arena. So how important was this win for Mourinho and Manchester United? Match report - Man Utd win Europa League Herrera dedicates trophy to victims Relive Manchester United's Europa League victory over Ajax Listen to Mark Chapman's emotional tribute to Manchester on 5 live How the Man Utd players rated Mourinho spoke of the ""humble principles"" behind his fourth win in a European final that also allowed Manchester United to join the select group who have claimed every trophy on offer outside the domestic game, a list that includes Ajax, Bayern Munich, Chelsea and Juventus. Amid this show of self-proclaimed humility Mourinho still found time to take aim at ""the poets"" (presumably pundits) who he claimed win every game they play, and also take a swipe at his rivals in the Premier League. Mourinho was raised aloft by his coaching staff after Wednesday's victory ""In a bad season when sometimes I felt my team were the worst team in the world, where I felt I was the worst manager in the world, we managed to win three trophies [the Community Shield in August being the other] and go into the Champions League by winning a trophy not by finishing second, third or fourth,"" he said. It was a less than subtle jab in the direction of Mauricio Pochettino at Tottenham, his old adversary Pep Guardiola at Manchester City and Liverpool's Jurgen Klopp - with Mourinho perhaps taking notice of Sunday's wild celebrations on and off the pitch at Anfield after fourth place was confirmed. It was a win Mourinho desperately needed - and how it showed on his face. The scowl that has been a trademark this season was replaced by a beaming smile. The pressure was released and the years seemed to roll away as he turned to his family behind the technical area at the final whistle and raised an index finger to the skies. It was a gesture he said was a coded message to his loved ones but it could also have been a reminder that the manager who was a Premier League title winner only seven months before the sack at Chelsea was in the winners' enclosure once more. It was a night high on emotion after Monday's attack in Manchester and it also seemed a night when Mourinho's bond with United's fans was sealed. Jose Mourinho's record in Europe Porto:Uefa Cup 2003, Champions League 2004 Inter Milan:Champions League 2010 Manchester United:Europa League 2017 He has occasionally looked an uneasy fit at Old Trafford but here he was at home. As he held the trophy aloft in front of United's elated support, Mourinho's name was chanted in a manner rarely heard this season. It looked and sounded like he was finally right at home. Mourinho gambled on winning the Europa League to put Manchester United back in the Champions League. The fight for a place in the Premier League's top four was cast aside weeks ago as he concentrated on a competition he once derided but which now offered the opportunity to win a spot against Europe's best. And the success of Mourinho's gamble means United's summer strategy can be built around not simply offering targets that Old Trafford can deliver financially but also the lure of the Champions League. Pogba scored United's opening goal in Stockholm, with the help of a deflection United were still able to bring world record transfer Paul Pogba back to Old Trafford without that enticement last summer - but Mourinho and Old Trafford's decision-makers know that an offer without Champions League football would soon result in diminishing returns. It was virtually seconds after victory over Ajax that the odds on Atletico Madrid's world-class forward Antoine Griezmann joining United shortened considerably, despite a reported Â£85m release clause in his contract. Mourinho revealed executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward has been in possession of his transfer hit-list for two months but this Europa League win could act as even more of a game-changer with United being viewed an even more attractive proposition now. This was not just a night of huge significance for Mourinho. The stakes were high for United's status - and they were all winners. Two major trophies in his first season cannot disguise that Manchester United still need further renovation. The grim statistic of 15 draws in what was a largely unsatisfactory league campaign tells the tale. And there is every chance the list Mourinho passed to Woodward eight weeks ago will have outlined demands to strengthen the spine of a team that has failed too often, despite its eventual success, to get the result required. Goalkeeper David de Gea, who watched Wednesday's win as Sergio Romero took his traditional Europa League place, is still linked with a move to Real Madrid so Mourinho may be looking for a replacement there, with Atletico Madrid's Jan Oblak a contender. Eric Bailly, suspended against Ajax, has been a big success since his Â£30m move from Villarreal and Mourinho is a fan of Marcos Rojo - but there must be question marks against both Phil Jones and Chris Smalling. Will Antoine Griezmann be joining the Old Trafford club this summer? Not only has their form been mixed, Mourinho has appeared to question the speed with which the England pair recovered from injury, calling on them on one occasion ""to be brave - risk"". United are in a strong position to sign Burnley's 24-year-old England defender Michael Keane, although there would be a measure of embarrassment, as there was with Pogba's return, after he was packed off from Old Trafford to Turf Moor by Van Gaal in January 2015 for only Â£2m. He would cost around Â£25m but United would pay a smaller fee because they would activate the 25% sell-on clause they included in his move to Burnley. Keane also represents a fitter and younger option than Jones, 25, and 27-year-old Smalling. Mourinho may also look to bring in extra midfield strength, with links to Monaco's Â£70m Bernardo Silva while the desire to bring the class and quality of 26-year-old France forward Griezmann to United is an open secret. The list may not be long but it might be very expensive. The Europa League win and the return of Champions League football means Mourinho is in a better position to demand and Woodward is in a better position to deliver. One name sticks out when the question of departures is raised - Wayne Rooney. For all Mourinho's public assurances that he would be happy to keep the 31-year-old, there was a real sense of farewell as he came on as substitute a minute from time, Antonio Valencia making great play of offering him the captain's armband. Rooney was also greeted by the sort of noise and affection from United's fans that has decreased with his decline, a gesture of thanks and perhaps a goodbye to a player who has been a magnificent contributor since his Â£27m move from Everton in the summer of 2004. He has a club record of 253 goals from 558 games and has won five league titles, three League Cups, the Champions League, the FA Cup and now the Europa League. It does seem, however, that the credits are rolling and options appear to be a move to China, the United States or a return to his first love Everton, although that would take some serious financial compromise on Rooney's part as he is on a reported Â£300,000 a week and has two years to run on his contract. United captain Rooney may have played his last match for the club And what of Zlatan Ibrahimovic, an outstanding success even at 35, scoring 28 goals after his free transfer move from Paris St-Germain until he sustained a serious knee injury? Mourinho spoke with genuine affection about a player and personality he first forged a bond with at Inter Milan but his option for a second year on his contract has not been taken up and United will surely want to study his recovery from an injury that would be a serious setback for any player, let alone a 35-year-old. He may survive if Mourinho feels he does not wish to lose Rooney and Ibrahimovic's experience - but it will be a delicate decision. Michael Carrick is also waiting to commit his future. The 35-year-old, who has a testimonial at Old Trafford on 4 June, has been involved in contract talks that have progressed well - but will the veteran feel he might get more football elsewhere? It will not be a matter of Mourinho simply handing that list to Woodward. United may also want to cut back on their squad for next season. Mourinho has never been held back by modesty - but he looked like a man with confidence and self-belief fully restored as United's season came to this successful conclusion in Stockholm. Now, buoyed by this success, Mourinho and United must set sights higher next season. United's sixth place in the Premier League was simply not good enough and a serious title challenge must be the target after what is likely to be a summer of huge investment as a show of faith in Mourinho's management. The Champions League has always had a special place in Mourinho's affections and he will want to make another journey into its later stages. Manchester United winning the League Cup and the Europa League can be considered a highly successful return - but now Mourinho must take the lift to the next floor and challenge for the Premier League and Champions League.

Man Utd fans unite in silence after bombing,"Manchester United fans pitched a defiant banner in the Rorstrandsgatan fan zone As Manchester's Red Devils prepared for one of their most important games in years, football fans observed a minute's silence in memory of the victims of Monday's bombing. The attack may have tested the city's resolve, but it didn't stop thousands gathering to share a drink and a hug, and watch Manchester United'striumphant Europa League final. Even the club's rivalries with the likes of Liverpool and Manchester City were put to one side, and supporters around the world wished the team well. ""I can see tomorrow's headlines already,"" said fan Harry Charlton. ""It will just say 'United'."" Manchester attack: Latest updates Special report on Manchester concert attack Police hunt Manchester attack 'network' Mr Charlton was at the Old Nags Head in the city centre for the game, where fans watching on TV observed the same silence as the United players and their Dutch opponents Ajax did in the Friends Arena in Stockholm. The pub has a reputation as one of the city's most diehard United-supporting venues. This video can not be played Manchester United fans observed a minuteâs silence before the match The 33-year-old bricklayer said: ""It's about unity. Manchester United has always been the most hated team in the world, because of its success, but I think everyone wants us to win this time. ""These attacks have hurt everybody. Everybody in the country. This match is a chance for the city and our friends everywhere to be united. ""A Manchester City fan walked past earlier with a club jacket on and he'd usually be told where to go. But even he said 'lads, I hope you win'."" Father-of-one Michael Noone, from Gorton, said he hoped the team would show the same fight and resolve that was so evident in the city's defiant response to the attack. Manchester United fans including Michael Noone, left, and Harry Charlton watched the match at the Old Nags Head In the end, Manchester United's 2-0 win saw them take the trophy and return to the Champions League. ""Usually we have the big rivalries, like with City and Liverpool, but everybody has come together, regardless of the colour of their football shirts,"" the 35-year-old recruitment manager said. ""The reaction has been huge, and this is just another way to help bring people together. ""You have a big terror attack like this but so much good has come out afterwards. It's just a shame it had to happen at all."" However, despite regular renditions of the usual football songs and chants, Daniel Constable, of Levenshulme, said he detected a sombre quality in the atmosphere. ""It was a bit different getting the taxi into town,"" he said. ""You could see it in the eyes of everybody walking around. I think everyone's thinking about the same things. ""But the sun is shining and its been good to see everybody coming out happy to watch the game."" From Bill Rice, BBC Radio Manchester, in Stockholm In Stockholm, the atmosphere was said to be sombre and understated The mood among Manchester United fans shifted from understated and sombre following Monday's attack to hope and expectation in Sweden. Keiron, a student in Manchester who travelled to the Swedish capital, says the response from the city of Manchester has been ""incredible"". ""They are such great people and so willing to rally round in difficult times,"" he said before kick-off. ""The atmosphere in Stockholm has been a little bit subdued. In the stadium it is going to be emotional, but I hope we use that emotion to perform better and bring the trophy home."" Fans travelling to the game were quiet, after many had spent much of Monday night checking on friends and loved ones. They were tired because of it. Manchester United players observed a minute's silence in tribute to the victims of the Manchester attack However, by Wednesday in the sunshine and heat of Stockholm, fans were drinking, chanting and looking forward to the final, albeit with mixed feelings. Ryan, from Worsley, admitted it had not been quite the same as previous trips into Europe. While he is ""looking forward to it"", he said it was ""on a bit of a downer, we want to be happy but at the same time we are worried about everyone at home"". Lee, also from Worsley, said the game was less important to him. ""I think you realise it's just a game of football,"" he said.

United are in a strong position to sign Burnley's 24-year-old England defender Michael Keane, although there would be a measure of embarrassment, as there was with Pogba's return, after he was packed off from Old Trafford to Turf Moor by Van Gaal in January 2015 for only Â£2m. He would cost around Â£25m but United would pay a smaller fee because they would activate the 25% sell-on clause they included in his move to Burnley. Keane also represents a fitter and younger option than Jones, 25, and 27-year-old Smalling. Mourinho may also look to bring in extra midfield strength, with links to Monaco's Â£70m Bernardo Silva while the desire to bring the class and quality of 26-year-old France forward Griezmann to United is an open secret. The list may not be long but it might be very expensive. The Europa League win and the return of Champions League football means Mourinho is in a better position to demand and Woodward is in a better position to deliver. One name sticks out when the question of departures is raised - Wayne Rooney. For all Mourinho's public assurances that he would be happy to keep the 31-year-old, there was a real sense of farewell as he came on as substitute a minute from time, Antonio Valencia making great play of offering him the captain's armband. Rooney was also greeted by the sort of noise and affection from United's fans that has decreased with his decline, a gesture of thanks and perhaps a goodbye to a player who has been a magnificent contributor since his Â£27m move from Everton in the summer of 2004. He has a club record of 253 goals from 558 games and has won five league titles, three League Cups, the Champions League, the FA Cup and now the Europa League. It does seem, however, that the credits are rolling and options appear to be a move to China, the United States or a return to his first love Everton, although that would take some serious financial compromise on Rooney's part as he is on a reported Â£300,000 a week and has two years to run on his contract. United captain Rooney may have played his last match for the club And what of Zlatan Ibrahimovic, an outstanding success even at 35, scoring 28 goals after his free transfer move from Paris St-Germain until he sustained a serious knee injury? Mourinho spoke with genuine affection about a player and personality he first forged a bond with at Inter Milan but his option for a second year on his contract has not been taken up and United will surely want to study his recovery from an injury that would be a serious setback for any player, let alone a 35-year-old. He may survive if Mourinho feels he does not wish to lose Rooney and Ibrahimovic's experience - but it will be a delicate decision. Michael Carrick is also waiting to commit his future. The 35-year-old, who has a testimonial at Old Trafford on 4 June, has been involved in contract talks that have progressed well - but will the veteran feel he might get more football elsewhere? It will not be a matter of Mourinho simply handing that list to Woodward. United may also want to cut back on their squad for next season. Mourinho has never been held back by modesty - but he looked like a man with confidence and self-belief fully restored as United's season came to this successful conclusion in Stockholm. Now, buoyed by this success, Mourinho and United must set sights higher next season. United's sixth place in the Premier League was simply not good enough and a serious title challenge must be the target after what is likely to be a summer of huge investment as a show of faith in Mourinho's management. The Champions League has always had a special place in Mourinho's affections and he will want to make another journey into its later stages. Manchester United winning the League Cup and the Europa League can be considered a highly successful return - but now Mourinho must take the lift to the next floor and challenge for the Premier League and Champions League.

SportMorgan ton in England win over S Africa24 May 2017 (22:29:47),"First one-day international, Headingley: England 339-6 (50 overs):Morgan 107 (93), Moeen 77* (51) South Africa 267 (45 overs):Woakes 4-38, Amla 73 England won by 72 runs Match scorecard A brilliant Eoin Morgan century led England to a 72-run victory over South Africa in the first one-day international at Headingley. Skipper Morgan made 107 from 93 deliveries and Moeen Ali an unbeaten 77 from 51 to get the home side to 339-6. South Africa were well placed at 145-1, but were bowled out for 267 with Chris Woakes taking 4-38. England will seal the three-match series with victory at Southampton on Saturday (11:00 BST). After routine victories over Ireland,world number ones South Africa present much sterner opposition for England in the build-up to the Champions Trophy,which begins on 1 June. With IPL trio Ben Stokes, Jos Buttler and Woakes back in the side - and the in-form Jonny Bairstow omitted as expected - England's powerful batting took full advantage of being put in on a flat surface under glorious sunshine. Though they wobbled after a strong start, Morgan and man-of-the-match Moeen took England to the highest ODI total at Headingley and their 20th in excess of 300 since the 2015 World Cup. For a time, their attack looked vulnerable - improvement is likely to be needed in the Champions Trophy - but a series of poor South African strokes helped England's cause. England were also guilty of some recklessness. Alex Hales and Joe Root both fell to Andile Phehlukwayo when well set, before Stokes and Buttler went in the space of 10 balls to leave the hosts 198-5 in the 35th over. The wristy Morgan, with flays through the off side and power on the leg, had already passed 50, but Moeen looked uncomfortable against the short ball. However, after Morgan heaved Phehlukwayo over the mid-wicket fence, England charged. Moeen launched leg-spinner Imran Tahir for three sixes in an over to bring up a 35-ball half-century and Morgan reached his 10th ODI century for England with his fifth maximum. Though Morgan was held at long-off from the impressive pace bowling of Chris Morris, Moeen hit the same bowler for six from the last delivery of the innings to make a total of 102 runs from the final 10 overs. There is a suspicion that England's bowling does not match the strength of their batting in ODIs. Indeed, while England have scored more runs per over than any other side since the 2015 World Cup, they have also conceded more than all but Sri Lanka. Here, Hashim Amla and Faf du Plessis looked set to exploit the England attack, not missing an opportunity to punish anything marginally short or wide. They shared a stand of 112 until Mark Wood, otherwise expensive, returned to trap Amla lbw on review and, in the next over, Liam Plunkett had Du Plessis caught behind. JP Duminy and David Miller both hit poor deliveries straight to the fielder on the leg-side boundary and Morris was caught reverse sweeping, but South Africa remained dangerous so long as AB de Villiers was at the crease. The Proteas skipper, the number one ODI batsman in the world, had just begun to open his shoulders when he lofted Moeen to Plunkett at deep mid-wicket. As he departed, so too did South Africa's hopes, with a bad day for the tourists capped by a fine for a slow over-rate. De Villiers lost 20% of his match fee and the rest of the team 10%. Headingley observed a minute's silence before the start of the game following Monday's attack in Manchester England's 339-6 is the highest total made in an ODI at Headingley. This is the first time England have made 300 at home against South Africa. It is also their second-highest total against the Proteas. The highest is 399 at Bloemfontein in February 2016. That was Eoin Morgan's third century in his past eight ODI innings, having not scored one in his previous 24 matches. Eoin Morgan (4,767) has now overtaken Alec Stewart (4,692) to become the third-highest run-scorer for England in ODIs. Only Paul Collingwood (5,092) and Ian Bell (5,416) have more. England captain Eoin Morgan on TMS:""It was a pretty good day at the office for us. Playing against a strong South Africa team and putting in an all-round performance was brilliant. ""I have felt good for a while. I didn't play as much in the IPL as I would have liked but I got a few runs in the Ireland game and to continue that here is a good feeling. ""If Moeen Ali didn't get any runs and had a bad day, I'd probably pick him again. I have that much confidence in the guy. He's made some huge contributions for us over the last couple of years and beyond that."" Man of the match Moeen Ali on TMS:""To get us to 339 in the end, I was very pleased with that. We finished well with the momentum. We bat all the way down so I gave myself a bit of a chance. I backed my game a bit more today - in the past sometimes I've not done that. ""I've not been batting or bowling well recently. Paul Farbrace gave me a few tips with my batting and that really helped me today."" South Africa captain AB de Villiers: ""England played phenomenally well with the bat in hand. Morgan really dominated with the hundred and manipulated us really well. ""We didn't bat well enough, we definitely should have come a lot closer. We just didn't get partnerships going tonight."" Former England batter Ebony Rainford-Brent on TMS:""England have still got a lot of room for improvement but I'm very impressed with how they've approached today. Eoin Morgan has the awareness of the game and the gaps. He'll have a gameplan within seconds, and he'll free his arms. He's in fine form leading in to that Champions Trophy.""

Poll Tracker,"Check the latest opinion polls trends with the poll tracker, which measures general election voting intention. Please enable Javascript to view our poll tracker. Note on margin of error:Polling companies generally claim that 95% of the time, a poll of 1,000 people will be accurate within a margin of error of +/-3 percentage points. This means that a figure in the poll could be up to three percentage points higher or lower than that shown. For parties with smaller percentages, the margins of error are correspondingly smaller. Once again the polls, taken as a whole, were not a good guide to the election result. Over the course of the campaign the gap between the main two parties narrowed but, with one exception, the final polls all suggested a clearer Conservative lead than the actual outcome. Read more from Peter Barnes Nearly all the final polls are now out. Ipsos Mori will publish on Thursday and ICM are expected to update their preliminary figures from earlier today. Apart from that, we're there. What should we take from them? First, it's worth making the obvious point that every single poll throughout the campaign has put the Conservative Party ahead. If Labour receives more votes tomorrow it will be a bigger polling failure than in 2015. Manifesto guide: Where the parties stand How the BBC reports polling day How to follow results night and what to watch for Second, the range of vote shares for the parties in polls published on Tuesday and Wednesday are CON 41-46%, LAB 34-40%, LD 7-10%, and UKIP 2-5%. Not all the polls separate out the SNP, Plaid Cymru or Green Party. We've looked a lot at the gap between the two top parties - arguably too much. But the polls suggest it could be anywhere between a one and 12-point Conservative lead, with Survation suggesting the closest result. That suggests anything from a small swing to Labour to a 2-3% swing to the Conservatives. And it's doubly difficult to estimate how that could play out in terms of the number of seats each party wins. So much will depend on variations in different parts of the country and in different types of constituency. There could be no national swing between Conservatives and Labour but still a significant shift in seats. The BBC/ITV/Sky exit poll will be published at 10pm on Thursday, when polls close. It would be an understatement to say it's eagerly awaited. The final polls in Scotland suggest a fairly settled picture - although there have only been seven of them during the whole campaign so there's not much to go on. The SNP are clearly out in front on 40% or a little higher. The Conservatives and Labour are in a battle for second place at around 25%, perhaps with the Conservatives' ahead by a nose. That would represent a significant shift from the actual 2015 result of SNP 50%, LAB 24%, CON 15%. In Wales, YouGov are the only company to have produced polls throughout the campaign so we have even less evidence. Their last, released on Wednesday, showed little change from the previous two. Labour remain on 46% and the Conservatives fall back one point to 34%. Plaid Cymru are on 9% with both the Lib Dems and UKIP on 5%. That implies a modest swing to Labour with UKIP losing well over half their 2015 votes. Three polls have been published since the weekend - by Opinium, Survation and ICM. None of them showed dramatic changes from what they'd had before. The race is still very close according to Survation - their phone poll showed similar figures to their weekend internet poll - but the Conservatives have a handsome lead according to ICM. Opinium's poll (CON 43, LAB 36, LD 8, UKIP 5, SNP 5, GRN 2) was their last of the campaign. Lots of other polls are expected today. We should have final figures from ComRes, ICM, Kantar Public and YouGov. Others are possible as well. We'll update the poll tracker as they are released. Ipsos Mori are expected to publish their final figures on Thursday. That won't get added to the BBC poll tracker because ofeditorial guidelines,external, which state that no opinion poll on any issue relating to the election can be published on polling day. Get the latest news in your inbox, each weekday morning,external The normal array of Saturday night polls have been published - six in total. All of them still have the Conservatives in the lead but by a widely-varying degree. The gap over Labour ranges from just one point in Survation's poll to 12 points according to ComRes. Clearly, the discrepancies between the polling companies are very large. And that obviously makes it hard to draw firm conclusions. Survation's poll has the narrowest gap of any poll so far during the campaign. It's the only company that has not changed its methodology since 2015. But up to now they've not been especially favourable to Labour. Their poll was conducted today, after last night's Question Time special, where Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn faced questions from a live audience. And they found that more people who watched the programme said it made them more likely to vote Labour than Conservative. It's very unclear whether this could really have caused a significant shift though. A further complication is that most of Survation's polls in this campaign have been conducted by phone. This was an internet poll so it makes comparisons with their previous figures harder. Ipsos MORI also published a poll on Friday with a Conservative lead of 5%. In addition to the voting intention numbers, they reported a dramatic change in attitudes towards the two main party leaders. Since she became Prime Minister, Theresa May has always enjoyed positive approval figures - more people have said that they are satisfied with her performance than dissatisfied. But in their latest poll she has slumped to a negative overall figure of -7% (43% satisfied, 50% dissatisfied). Meanwhile, Jeremy Corbyn's rating has shot up. He's still in negative territory and, on -11%, still behind Theresa May. But that contrasts with -41% in March, before the election was called. Other pollsters have seen a similar trend. ComRes have also reported Theresa May's first negative negative rating (-3%). Opinium put Jeremy Corbyn on -12%, up from -35% at the start of the campaign. Theresa May has fallen to +6%. For ORB tonight's poll will be their last of the campaign. Their final figures are CON 45%, LAB 36%, LD 8% and UKIP 4%. Other companies will be publishing further polls in the final week of the campaign though. YouGov have also been updating their seat projection - that should also continue in the coming days. After their striking seat projection published last night, YouGov has a new poll this evening which has the narrowest gap between the main two parties so far during the campaign. It has the Conservatives on 42% and Labour on 39% - their highest rating in any poll since 2014. It's not all good news for Labour though. Kantar Public also published a poll on Wednesday with a slightly increased Conservative lead compared to their previous poll. They now have the Conservatives on 43% and Labour on 33%. Its not the only company which still shows a large gap. In fact, it's more than 10% according to ICM and ComRes. The main reason for this disparity is the different ways that the pollsters estimate turnout. Polling companies are sometimes accused of ""herding"" - manipulating their figures so they all say the same thing. Nobody could accuse them of that at this election. If anything, the differences have become more stark as we approach election day. Scotland There was also a rare Scottish poll published on Wednesday afternoon. The SNP, on 43%, maintained the commanding lead that they've had throughout the campaign and for a long time before that. More interesting was that Labour and the Conservatives were on level pegging at 25%. That's the first time this year that the Conservatives haven't been in a clear second place. As with the other nations, though, it's hard to draw conclusions when there have been so few polls. The polls covered in the BBC tracker are standard voting intention polls. That is, they try to gauge levels of support for each of the parties across the country. They do not attempt to say how many seats each party would win. There's a good reason for that. The first-past-the-post electoral system means that there is no straightforward relationship between votes and seats won. The 2017 election could be almost a repeat of the 2015 result in terms of vote share but produce a very different outcome in terms of the number of MPs returned for each party. Clearly, though, people are interested in knowing how votes might translate into seats. SoYouGov,externalhave attempted to model how that could work. Their projection of a hung parliament has, understandably, caused a stir. The model used to make this projection is complicated. It's not based on a single poll, but on the responses of 50,000 people who have taken part in other YouGov polls. Nor does it work by just counting up how the respondents in each constituency said they would vote. Even with 50,000 people there wouldn't be nearly enough to have a reliable sample in each of the 650 constituencies in the UK. Instead, it uses demographic information about the people who take part in the polls, as well as information about where they live and how they've voted before, to try to work out how different types of people are likely to vote. Then it looks at the demographic make-up of each constituency and comes up with an estimate of the likely outcome. YouGov themselves have indicated that their projection is subject to quite a lot of uncertainty. And Stefan Shakespeare, the company's Chief Executive, has said that it would only take a small shift in favour of the Conservatives to see them win a healthy Conservative majority. So it should definitely be treated with caution. Wales update There's been no shortage of Britain-wide polls but in the individual nations it's a different story. With so few polls focused on the election in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland it's impossible to identify any well-supported trends. That said, there has been one Welsh poll since I last mentioned them which showed a very different picture from the two that had gone before. YouGov gave Labour a 10 point lead in Wales whereas previously they'd shown a clear Conservative advantage. The direction of shift is consistent with what we've seen in the national polls but it's very difficult to know what to make of the particular numbers. It's a huge turnaround and we really would need more evidence before drawing any firm conclusions. Five polls have been published this evening. Overall, they reinforce Thursday night's polls which suggested that the Conservative lead over Labour has shrunk again since last weekend but there are quite large differences between the pollsters' figures. ICM and ComRes have a larger gap between the two main parties than the other companies. They put it at 14% and 12% respectively but that's still down from what they were showing two weeks ago. The others have it at 6%-10%. There will no doubt be some talk about the fact that Labour has dropped two points in YouGov's poll compared to the one they published on Thursday. But that still means that the gap is narrower than they found last weekend and it would be unwise to read too much into a small change between two individual polls. The general trend is clear. The Conservatives are still ahead but Labour has closed the gap. Is the shift believable? The godfather of psephology or the study of elections, Sir David Butler, said this week that the movement in the polls over this campaign is bigger than in any election he's covered since 1945. But many experts think that election campaigns don't make much difference - voters' views are set years or months before polling day. So does that mean the polls must be wrong? Not necessarily. Voters have become much more volatile than they used to be - much less loyal to a single party. Chris Prosser and Jane Green from theBritish Election Study,externalhave shown that over the last 50 years the proportion of voters who switch parties between elections has risen from around 15% in the 1960s and 1970s to 43% in 2015. We can't be sure that the same will happen this time and many of the people who do switch might have made up their minds before the campaign started. It's also possible that people who said they were going to switch at the start of the campaign have gone back to the party they supported before. But if voters are more likely to change allegiance than in the past then perhaps we shouldn't be too surprised if the polls show large movements. How reliable is Labour's vote? One reason for caution about Labour's advance is that their improved polling numbers are based on very high levels of support among young voters and people who didn't vote in 2015. A big part of the problem with the polls in 2015 was that they failed to estimate accurately the difference in turnout rates among different groups of voters. In particular, they underestimated the turnout gap between young and old voters. As I've mentioned before, many of the pollsters have adjusted their methods to try to overcome this problem. But concerns remain about whether the people who say they'll vote Labour will actually do so on 8 June. If they don't then Labour's vote share could be lower than the polls suggest. Two new polls published on Thursday night suggest a further continuation of the trend we've seen throughout the campaign so far. The gap between the Conservatives and Labour has narrowed again. It's down to eight points in Kantar Public's poll and just five points in YouGov's - smaller than the actual gap between the parties at the 2015 election. The Manchester attack has, rightly, meant that the country's attention has been focused away from the election. But as the campaign resumes, it's inevitable that people will ask whether it's had an effect on how people might vote. So it's important to note that Kantar Public's poll was conducted before the attack, but YouGov's was done afterwards - on Wednesday and Thursday. That doesn't mean we can say that the latest shift is related to the attack. Theresa May has consistently had a strong lead over Jeremy Corbyn on the issues of defence and security. That hasn't changed. YouGov found that 55% of respondents trusted Theresa May to make the right decisions to keep Britain safe from terrorism compared to just 33% who trusted Jeremy Corbyn. It's possible that the polls are still reacting to the fallout of the manifesto launches last week - and the revisions to the Conservatives' social care plans announced on Monday (they denied it was a U-turn). There could also just be an element of natural polling variation. Whatever the cause, the important thing to remember is to look at the general trend rather than concentrating too much on individual polls. The Conservatives retain a clear lead over Labour but the gap has closed significantly. After the week of the manifesto launches for the main GB-wide parties, the trend of Labour improvement that we've seen throughout the campaign is continuing. In fact, four polls released on Saturday, for the Sunday papers, suggest that the Labour advance has strengthened. And, while the Lib Dems and UKIP are still below where they were when the election was announced, for the first time it looks as though the latest Labour rise is coming at the expense of the Conservatives. The Conservative lead was generally around 20 points or a little above in the middle of April. It's down to between 9 and 13 points in today's polls. As ever, the figures should be treated with caution. It's particularly worth noting that none of the most recent polls come from the companies that tend to put Labour on a lower figure. ICM and Kantar Public both make adjustments based on turnout rates for different groups of people at previous elections. They've had Labour at a lower level than some of the other companies throughout the campaign. So it will be interesting to see whether their next polls follow a similar pattern. Looking beneath the voting intention figures there are some clues about what might be causing the shift towards Labour that we've seen. One is voters' responses to the manifestos. For example, Survation found that nearly half of respondents opposed Conservative plans for changes to the system of funding for social care. By contrast, Labour's plan to increase income tax for people earning over Â£80,000 was backed by more than six out of ten people and opposed by under a quarter. Jeremy Corbyn has also seen an improvement in his approval ratings although he still lags a long way behind Theresa May. For example, Opinium have him on a net figure of -18 this week, up from -28 last week. Despite the significant moves we should still remember that the Conservatives retain a large lead by historical standards. If today's polls were repeating on 8 June it would be the biggest gap between the two parties since Tony Blair's landslide in 1997 in terms of share of the vote. There's also some evidence in the polls that the Labour vote is ""softer"" than the Conservative vote. In other words, more Labour voters than Conservative voters say they might change their minds. Four polls over the weekend reinforced the picture of aLabourimprovement during the course of the campaign so far. ORB, Opinium, ComRes and YouGov all had them at 30% or above - clearly above the levels seen at around the time the election was announced. However, this increase has not come at the expense of theConservativeswho remain in the mid-to-high 40s with a commanding lead. The main losers have beenUKIP, who are down in the 3-6% range. If the current polls were reflected in the final result it would mean the two main parties between them capturing a significantly larger share of the vote than at recent elections. In 2015, they received a total of 69%. The polls suggest a joint share of almost 80%. You have to go back to 1992 to find an election where the total Conservative and Labour share was close to that - the figure was 78%. The last time it was above 80% was 1979. All the polls shown in the tracker report vote intention share across Great Britain, but that's not very helpful for working out what's going on in parts of the UK where other parties stand. However as we've only seen two campaign polls in Scotland, two in Wales and one in Northern Ireland so far, there's not very much evidence to go on. Having said that, both of the Scottish polls, conducted by Survation and YouGov, have given theSNPover 40% with a clear lead over the Conservatives on 28% and Labour down in third place on 18%. In Wales, two YouGov polls have put the Conservatives ahead of Labour, but with a smaller gap than across Britain as a whole. Like in the national polls, Labour's share has seen an improvement from the beginning of the campaign.Plaid Cymruare back in third place In Northern Ireland, the single Lucid Talk poll gave theDUPa narrow lead overSinn Feinwith theUUP,SDLPand theAllianceall some way back. As well as asking people which party they intend to vote for, pollsters also ask which issues are the most important. In 2015 the three biggest issues were theNHS,immigrationandthe economy. A significant change at this election is the emergence ofBrexit. Polls conducted since the election was called have put it at the top of the list of important issues ahead of theNHSin second place with the economy and immigration battling it out for third. This may help to explain, at least in part, the Conservatives' lead in the polls. So far as we can tell, they've managed to attract the support of a large number of new voters who backed leave at last year's referendum whilst holding on to most of their own supporters who backed remain - many of whom now think that the Government has a duty to implement the outcome of the referendum. As everybody knows, the polls got the 2015 general election wrong. They suggested that the likely outcome was a hung parliament but, as we know, the Conservatives won an overall majority. So is it worth paying attention to them this time? Well, we certainly shouldn't assume that the result will be exactly what the polls say. But that doesn't mean they're completely useless. For one thing, critics have perhaps exaggerated other polling ""disasters"". The belief that the polls were just as bad at the EU referendum and in the US Presidential election is widely held. However, whilst some polls gave a misleading picture at the referendum, others were pretty close. We reported at the timethat the polls overall indicated a very narrow race in the weeks running up to referendum day. Similarly, at the US election,the national polls weren't that far offin terms of the share of the vote won by Donald Trump and Hilary Clinton - Clinton actually won the popular vote by over 2%. It was state polls that were unreliable and led to a misleading impression as to who would emerge from the Electoral College system as president. In both cases, if all we'd taken from the polls was that the votes would be close, we would have been on the right lines. The polling companies have also made adjustments to try to prevent the problems of 2015 from happening again and to resolve issues that arose at the referendum. These methodological changes vary from pollster to pollster but there are some general trends. Several of them now ask the people who take part about their educational background. The aim, as with questions about class, age, gender and region is to get a sample of people who are representative of the population as a whole. Others have developed more sophisticated ways to estimate how likely it is that somebody who takes part in a poll will actually vote. Just asking people whether they will vote is not a good guide. Of course, we can't be sure whether these adjustments will make the polls more accurate. So some people will no doubt decide to ignore them all together. But there's still clearly an appetite for them. No fewer than 30 have been conducted since the Prime Minister made her surprise announcement on 18 April. That's more than one a day. General election: What you need to know It's now three weeks since the election was announced and the official campaign is well under way. After Theresa May's surprise statement, the Conservatives saw their poll rating jump with several polls suggesting a comfortable 20 point lead. Since then, nothing very dramatic has happened. There has been a modest uptick for Labour, who are generally up to the high 20s or around 30 - up from the mid 20s just after the announcement. But that still leaves a very large gap between the main two parties. UKIP seem to have slipped a little further down and perhaps the Lib Dems have also fallen back a bit, although these trends are not clear. Most opinion polls, and all of the ones covered in the BBC poll tracker, are either conducted by telephone or online. For phone polls the polling company rings up landline and mobile numbers. In principle, anyone with a phone could be asked to participate. For internet polls, the company maintains a panel of people who are prepared to take part. For each poll they will contact the required number of panel members. In both cases the company will aim to survey a sample of people who are representative of the country as a whole - in terms of age, gender, social class, etc. They will generally then apply weighting adjustments if one or other group is over-represented or under-represented in their sample. It's also common to seek a representative sample or apply a weighting based on past-voting behaviour.

Why doesn't Australia have an indigenous treaty?,"Mutitjulu elders gather at Uluru for a historic summit this week The future of Australia's relationship with its indigenous peoples could be significantly influenced by a meeting at Uluru this week. It will discuss changing the constitution, but may also include support for a treaty. Australia does not have one, unlike many nations, reports Trevor Marshallsea. In 1832, the governor of Van Diemen's Land reflected ruefully on his colonial administration's chaotic - and bloody - relationship with the island's indigenous population. Amid a period of great conflict between white colonists and Aborigines known as the Black War, Governor George Arthur said it was ""a fatal error"" a treaty had not been entered into with the Aboriginal people of what's now the Australian state of Tasmania, after white settlement had commenced some 30 years earlier. The absence of a treaty was cited by Mr Arthur as a crucial and aggravating factor in relations with the first inhabitants of the island, the scene of some of the worst treatment inflicted on Aborigines by British colonists. Almost 200 years later, Australia remains the only Commonwealth country to have never signed a treaty with its indigenous people. While treaties were established early on in other British dominions such as New Zealand, Canada and in the United States, the situation in Australia has been, often notoriously, different. Indigenous leaders meet for historic talks Fifty years ago this Saturday, a landmark referendum voted for the country's constitution to be changed to allow Aborigines to be counted among all Australians (whereas they had previously been excluded from the national census), and to shift power to legislate on indigenous affairs from the states to the federal government. A few years earlier, Aborigines had been given the right to vote in national and state elections. An Arnhem Land community leader at the opening ceremony of the First Nations Convention In 1988, then Prime Minister Bob Hawke was presented with ""the Barunga Statement"", named after an Aboriginal community. Written on bark, it called for a treaty. The cause had been thrust forcefully into the public consciousness in the late 1980s in various ways. One was rock band Midnight Oil's 1987 hit ""Beds Are Burning"", which implored white Australia to ""pay the rent, to pay our share"". Part-Aboriginal bandYothu Yindihad an international hit with ""Treaty"" a few years later. On receiving the Barunga Statement, which he had hung on a wall in Canberra's Parliament House, Mr Hawke vowed there would be a treaty by 1990. In 1992, Prime Minister Paul Keating made a now-famous speech in the Aboriginal-centric Sydney suburb of Redfern, addressing harsh truths about the often brutal and murderous ""dispossessing"" of the country's traditional owners. A year later came the watershed Native Title act, which threw out the historical view that Australia before European settlement in 1788 essentially belonged to no-one. And in 2008 Prime Minister Kevin Rudd delivered a long-awaitedapology,externalto Australia's indigenous peoples, for policies that had inflicted suffering on them. Despite these words, acts and gestures, there is still no treaty. Also, there remaincontentious sectionsof the nation's constitution which are race-based, although two significant others were removed in the 1967 referendum. Section 25 still says states can disqualify people from voting in elections on account of their race. Section 51 (xxvi) empowers the government to legislate for ""the people of any race for whom it is deemed necessary to make special laws"". Kevin Rudd hugs members of the Stolen Generations after his apology speech in 2008 This week, marking the referendum's 50th anniversary, an Aboriginalleaders' summitat Uluru (formerly Ayers Rock) is hopeful of reaching consensus on whether - and how - the constitution should be changed. But some delegations are expected to make statements about the need for a treaty, and financial compensation. The meeting will also shine a light on white Australia's troubled, and peculiar, historical attitude to the country's first inhabitants. Australia's distinct problem, historians say, took root from reports delivered back in England by the first white men to land on the east coast in 1770. ""Captain James Cook and (botanist) Joseph Banks reported the Aborigines were few in number and were just wandering around the place,"" says University of Sydney history professor Mark McKenna. Aboriginal leaders meet for historic talks Australia 'failing' on indigenous lives The people and history of the Torres Strait Islands ""The perception was they had no recognisable agricultural system, and they were basically savages."" Thus when Admiral Arthur Phillip led thefirst fleetto begin the colony of New South Wales in 1788, Mr McKenna says, ""there was no expectation any treaty with the locals would have to be signed. The way Australia was settled was in fact quite extraordinary."" Tasmanian Aboriginal writer and activist Michael Mansell told the BBC the English were deceived by their perceptions of Australian indigenous culture, including that they lived in small groups, by contrast to the large and seemingly more organised tribes of North America. The views of the first white visitors left a problematic legacy, historians say ""To them, the Australian Aborigines didn't display any of the trappings of a so-called noble culture,"" Mr Mansell says. ""They weren't riding horses like the native North Americans. They didn't have permanent dwellings. It was harder to discern who their leaders were. So they were regarded as a vulgar and backward people who could be treated as the invaders liked. ""In 1840 colonial officials in New Zealand were sitting down with the Maoris to sign the Treaty of Waitangi. At the same time in Australia, Aborigines were being hunted down, shot and slaughtered. ""All of this fostered a deeply entrenched cultural bias against Aboriginal people which, ever since, has been very hard to shake, both in attitudes and in a substantive way."" While provision was made for indigenous people in Canada's constitution in 1867, Mr Mansell points out that ""the only mention of Aborigines in Australia's constitution of 1901 was to exclude us"". At that time, Australia's first prime minister, Edmund Barton, said race-based clauses in the constitution allowed his government to ""regulate the affairs of the people of coloured or inferior races who are in the Commonwealth"". Little changed in attitudes in the ensuing years. This, Mr Mansell says, was partly due to a widespread belief that the Aboriginal race would simply die out, and be bred in amongst the European community, and because of the country's so-called ""White Australia"" policy on immigration. Existing in various forms from 1901 until 1973, the policy, though aimed at immigrants, did little to promote acceptance and cultural sensitivity. A crowd watches the apology to the Stolen Generations in 2008 While the 1980s and early 1990s brought attitudinal change, the plight of Aborigines was set back, Mr McKenna and Mr Mansell agree, under the conservative John Howard government of 1996-2007. Contrasting Mr Keating's Redfern Speech, Mr Howard said he would not take a ""black armband"" view of Australia's history on Aboriginal relations. In 2000 he said a country ""does not make a treaty with itself"". And in 2004 he announced the abolition of the peak government body handling indigenous issues, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC), following corruption investigations. ""John Howard shut the Aboriginal movement down completely,"" Mr Mansell says. ""ATSIC had its problems, but it was a sound moral concept. There's been plenty of crooked MPs, but they don't shut down parliament."" Still, despite Australia's troubled past on indigenous matters, and fears from government and business on the implications of a treaty, of financial compensation, or of official recognition of Aboriginal sovereignty over Australian lands, Mr Mansell is ""very optimistic"" substantive change can be sparked by this week's summit. ""What we need is a clear plan capable of being adopted by governments which will not interfere with the rest of Australia but will give empowerment to Aborigines, and give land back to those who can't get it under the Native Title Act,"" Mr Mansell said. With Australia's constitution difficult to change, many agree a more pressing need is the establishment of a national representative body allowing Aborigines to make their own decisions on matters affecting them, rather than have decisions forced on them from Canberra. ""A treaty would break the 200-year-old cycle of governments not negotiating with the Aboriginal people,"" says Mr McKenna, adding it would provide a framework for how negotiations are held on indigenous issues such as welfare, employment, education, health and land ownership. ""It would say 'we're no longer just going to do things to them', but that they're included and empowered.""

Man Utd win brings happiness - Beckham,"Manchester United's Europa League triumph has brought ""a little happiness at a difficult time"", said former England captain David Beckham. The Red Devilsbeat Ajaxin Wednesday's final in Stockholm, two days after the Manchester Arena bombing which killed 22 people and injured 64. ""Tonight was more important than sport,"" ex-United player Beckham said. The 42-year-old added it was ""a big night for United but an even bigger night for the city and our country"". 'I don't want to be here. I want to be at home' - 5 live presenter's tribute to Manchester Manchester attack: Police hunt 'network' behind bomber Greater Manchester Police said the final would be a ""poignant"" occasion following Monday's attack after an Ariana Grande pop concert, adding it was ""right"" for the game to go ahead despite discussions to postpone it. United fans and officials said before the final that the match was secondary to the ""pain and suffering"" in Manchester. On an emotional night in Sweden, United won their second major trophy of the season as they earned a 2-0 win against the Dutch side, securing Champions League football. ""At a time when we are grieving for the families that have lost loved ones, we have a sport that has brought a little happiness at a difficult time,"" said Beckham, who played 394 games for United between 1992 and 2003. ""We pray for peace,"" he added. This video can not be played 'This is for Manchester' - Man Utd fans on emotional triumph Paul Pogba,the world's most expensive player who scored United's first goal in Stockholm, said afterwards: ""We know that things like this are very sad, all over the world: in Manchester, in London and in Paris, too. We had to focus because it was a very important game and we won for them and for the country. ""We played for England, we played for Manchester, and we played for the people who died,"" said the 24-year-old Frenchman, who joined United as a teenager before leaving for Juventus in 2012 and returning last summer in an Â£89m move.

It is not easy when you feel it so close and you see so many people affected and so many people suffering. ""We felt the suffering and the sadness of the city of Manchester and today we tried to give this trophy for them.""

""Does this cup make the city of Manchester a bit happier? Maybe. ""But we just come to do our job. We come without the happiness that we should bring with us because when you come for these big matches, you go happy, you go proud and we didn't. ""We just came to do our job."" United should organise a victory parade when they return to Manchester to help raise spirits in the city following the bombing, says former Red Devils defender Phil Neville. The 40-year-old was part of the Red Devils squad which celebrated winning the Premier League, Champions League and FA Cup treble in 1999 with an open-top bus journey. ""When we won the Champions League we paraded the trophy in the city centre, ending in the Arena and celebrated there. It was unbelievable,"" the ex-England defender told BBC Radio 5 live. ""After what happened on Monday, United should parade the trophy around Manchester and finish at the Arena. ""I think it would be special. ""You should fill the streets of Manchester - Deansgate, St Peter's Square, St Ann's Square - and get the trophy back. ""Football can do brilliant things so don't go off on holiday, get back to Manchester, get the trophy out and share the success with the city."" David Beckham and Gary Neville parade the Champions League trophy around Manchester on an open-top bus in 1999 Manchester City sent this poignant tweet at full-time As the final whistle blew in Stockholm, Manchester United supporters embraced and celebrated their success before breaking out into a heartfelt chorus of ""Manchester, Manchester, Manchester"". BBC Sport's Simon Stone described the atmosphere inside the Friends Arena during the final: ""It had not begun to really feel like a high-stakes football match until the Ajax fans in the stadium joined in with the club songs as they were played out over the tannoy. ""One of the traditions of a Uefa final is a familiar voice on the microphone, urging the respective bunch of supporters to increase the volume ahead of the combatants' arrival. ""On Wednesday, it felt the heart wasn't in it. Not until the two teams lined up on the halfway line for a minute's silence that eventually turned into applause. ""'We'll never die', sang the United fans, a song about the club's own tragedy in Munich, extended on behalf of its city in the wake of Monday's attack. ""The 'Manchester - A City United' banner made its way up the lower tier behind the goal to manager Jose Mourinho's right. ""Danny, a 20-year-old from Moston in north Manchester, took three flights to get to Sweden, one of which was diverted to Copenhagen rather than Oslo. ""Others were let down by a charter flight they thought would bring them to Sweden being cancelled because organisers failed to attract enough bookings. Their reaction? Get in the car and drive... 1,400 miles to be precise. ""But on game-day, these fans didn't quite know what to do. With all their heart they wanted Manchester United to win. It seeps out of every pore. ""They also knew, for 90 minutes, some of the pain for some of those suffering, would not be quite so acute, before it came back and enveloped them again. In the scheme of things, the game doesn't matter."" Manchester United fans pitched a defiant banner in the Rorstrandsgatan fan zone United supporters were given about 9,500 tickets for the final, and those inside the Friends Arena broke out into spontaneous and defiant applause during what was supposed to be a minute's silence before kick-off. Neville, who played 389 times for the Red Devils between 1995 and 2005, said they had ""done the city proud"". ""The Manchester United fans were absolutely immense,"" he told BBC Radio 5 live. ""I am not an emotional person but after that noise from the fans following the minute's silence, there was definitely a tear in my eye. ""It was a wonderful evening. The atmosphere in the stadium was fantastic, we were still emotionally drained at the final whistle and our thoughts are still with people who lost their lives. ""That's who our hearts and prayers are with."" Paul Pogba moved to Manchester United as a teenager before leaving for Juventus in 2012 and returning in a world-record Â£89m move last summer Neville also picked out United midfielder Paul Pogba, who scored the opening goal with a deflected shot, for special praise. ""The moment of the match for me was just after the minute's silence when Pogba ran over to a banner that said 'the love we have for the people who lost their lives',"" he said. ""He acknowledged that banner and went around to every area where there were Manchester United fans. ""He clapped them, he sent them his love and went out there and produced a performance."" There wasn't quite the 120,000 estimated Ajax fans who flooded Amsterdam's Museum Square, but Manchester was awash with defiant United supporters amid a more sombre atmosphere. Some gathered at the Printworks, just a few hundred yards from Manchester Arena, the scene of Monday's attack, while others joined friends and fellow fans at pubs and clubs across the city. At the Old Nag's Head in the city centre, Red Devils fan Harry Charlton said the Europa League final gave the city and the country a chance to be ""united"". ""I can see Thursday's headlines already,"" said the 33-year-old bricklayer. ""It will just say 'United'. ""It's about unity. Manchester United has always been the most hated team in the world, because of its success, but I think everyone wants us to win this time. ""These attacks have hurt everybody. Everybody in the country."" An estimated 120,000 Ajax fans filled Amsterdam's Museum Square The Manchester United Supporters' Trust screened the match in front of about 2,000 fans and also held a collection for the victims of Monday's attack, which spokesman Sean Bones said had left the city ""numb"". ""We want the team to represent Manchester United and represent Manchester,"" he added. ""To give 100%, and to show the very, very best of what Mancunian spirit is all about."" Former Manchester United and Manchester City goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel said: ""In many ways football, all of sudden, became very insignificant. ""In many ways I can't get excited about this game. I think it's very difficult to think about football."" But the Dane added it also provided an opportunity for United ""to show the world that in adversity we will show fighting spirit and there's no way we are going to give in to cowards who bring acts like that into the world"".
