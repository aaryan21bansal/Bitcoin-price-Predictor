Homeless 'devastated' by doorway death,"Ross Miller had known Rob O'Connor since 2002 Homeless people have told of their shock after a man died in a shop doorway during a night of freezing temperatures. The body ofRob O'Connor was found in Springfield Road, Chelmsford on Friday morning. Essex Police said Mr O'Connor's death is being treated as unexplained. Although temperatures in the city dropped below 0C (32F) on the night of his death, his friends say he had been suffering with his health in general. Mr O'Connor, who was originally from Canada, is understood to have recently undergone an operation for cancer, which required the removal of his voice box. Ross Miller, who is homeless, said he had known Mr O'Connor for 16 years: ""I was devastated when I heard the news. He could be a pain, but he was all right. He was a nice bloke."" This message was put up by a homeless man in Chelmsford called Dave. Dave said he put up the board, which has since blown away, because he feared nobody else would recognise the death of a fellow rough sleeper He said the streets had been bitterly cold the past few days, adding: ""I wish I had somewhere to go. I don't like sitting here, I really don't. ""Some people are really kind, they give you the time of day, maybe a little food or some spare money.""

Wearable tech aids stroke patients,"This video can not be played Wearable tech could help stroke patients Scientists in the US are developing wearable sensors to speed up the recovery of stroke patients. The sensors are able to send information to doctors continuously. The team developing the system says it could allow therapists to more closely monitor the effectiveness of their care. Details of the study were released at the recent annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in Texas. Lizzy McAninch had a stroke two years ago. She could not move or speak or swallow for several weeks. Lizzy is testing out wearable sensors that might speed her recovery. They look like small white sticking plasters, but they send information wirelessly to her medical team. She is a doctor herself and can see how they could help her. They look like small sticking plasters ""This technology to put sensors on the body to assess which muscle groups work or not can really pinpoint the areas affected by the stroke and can target therapies to specifically improve those issues,"" she told BBC News. The sensors continue to send back readings even after she has finished her exercises. This means that her therapist Kristen Hohl, from the Shirley Ryan AbilityLab in Chicago, can monitor her progress at home. ""As a therapist, I think about what my patients are doing at home. Are they able to carry through the recommendations I'm giving them as a therapist to do more? Do we see that they are walking more or do we see them engaging in conversations? ""Those are the types of things that I can get feedback from the sensors where currently I have to rely on what they tell me they have done."" The team is gathering large amounts of data The challenge for the scientists was to pack a lot of electronics on to a small flexible material and still make it comfortable for the patient to wear for a long time. ""It is almost mechanically imperceptible to the patient who is wearing the device,"" according to John Rogers, of Northwestern University in Chicago, who developed the sensors. ""And you can embed all sorts of advanced sensor functionality, microprocessor computing capability, power supplies and WiFi into this very unusual platform, and that is the uniqueness of what we do."" By the end of this year, the research team will have more information than ever before on stroke recovery. The scientists believe that their study could transform the way patients are treated in the future.

Bardot wades into row over singer's will,"Bardot is known for her forthright views on animal rights and other issues Brigitte Bardot has become the latest French celebrity to weigh in on a family dispute over the estate of the late singer Johnny Hallyday. In a radio interview, the movie legend urged Hallyday's widow Laeticia - named as his main heir - to give some of the money back to his older children. Singer David Hallyday and actress Laura Smet, who were left with nothing, are contesting their father's will. Johnny Hallyday died in December from lung cancer at the age of 74. Bardot told French radio station Europe 1 on Saturday: ""I am disgusted. If I were Laeticia, I would put things right. I would give David and Laura what they deserve."" Laura Smet (left) is contesting the award to Hallyday's fourth wife, Laeticia (right) Under the country's inheritance laws, which go back to the French Revolution, all children should be given roughly equal shares of an estate. Johnny Hallyday: Story of a French rock phenomenon Huge crowds mourn Hallyday But Hallyday, who had a home in California and was domiciled there for tax purposes, left everything in his will to Laeticia, his fourth wife, and their two adopted daughters. Laura Smet, 34, and David Hallyday, 51, announced their legal challenge last week. Since then a number of big names in the world of French entertainment have spoken out on the matter.

Colombia extradites top drug suspect,"Prado Ãlava was arrested in Colombia in April 2017 A man accused of smuggling more than 250 tonnes of cocaine over the past decade has been extradited to the US from Colombia. Prosecutors say Washington Prado Ãlava, an Ecuadorean national, was a drug lord with operations across the Americas. He is also accused of ordering the murders of judges, prosecutors and police officers in Ecuador. Mr Prado Ãlava was known in Colombia as Ecuador's Pablo Escobar, the infamous MedellÃ­n Cartel leader killed in 1993. In Colombia, he tried to join the ranks of the Farc leftist rebel group before it signed a peace agreement in 2016. The Colombian prosecutors say his intention was to take advantage of a transitional justice system, which was agreed between the government and the Farc to deal with crimes committed by the rebels during five decades of conflict. ""Washington Prado Ãlava is considered one of the biggestcapos[bosses] in recent years and became a top target for the United States,"" the prosecutors said in a statement. Mr Prado Ãlava allegedly operated in Ecuador and on Colombia's Pacific coast. Prosecutors said his fleet of speedboats was used to make regular cocaine deliveries to Central America and Mexico, and, from there, the drugs were shipped over the border into the US. Mr Prado Ãlava was arrested in April 2017 as he travelled to visit family in the Colombian city of Cali. The US Drug Enforcement Agency provided the Colombian authorities with key intelligence that led to his arrest and that of three other alleged gang members. On Saturday, he was taken from a prison where he was being held in the capital, BogotÃ¡, and put on a plane to face justice in the US. Fifty agents took part in the extradition operation, Colombian authorities said.

New mother 'found bandages in my body',"Alexandra Loredana with her baby Dominic The NHS is investigating claims by a new mother who says she found bandages in her body seven weeks after giving birth at Wexham Park Hospital, Slough. ""I took out a large piece of decomposing material from inside me that was soaked in blood,"" Alexandra Loredana told BBC News. Ms Loredana added that she had suffered from thrush and 'light vaginal wounds'. A hospital trust spokesman told the BBC: ""We are aware. We have started an investigation."" Alexandra Loredana says the bandages were inside her body seven weeks after childbirth The new mother, from Slough, Berkshire, gave birth to baby Dominic in January. Ms Loredana said she initially explained to her midwife how she felt uncomfortable going to the toilet and that something smelled terrible - her midwife checked her stitches and said 'everything was fine'. The new mother said she was unable to get an appointment with her local walk-in centre until 7 March, 2018. She said: ""For seven weeks I changed my pads more than 10 times a day. Whether I had bleeding or not I just wanted my pads to absorb the horrible smell. ""Last night I had a bath for the first time and I felt courageous enough to wash with my fingers inside my vagina to clean it. ""I was breathless when I took out a large piece of decomposing material from inside me that smelled horrible and was soaked in blood. ""How did this happen?"" Ms Loredana then went to the accident and emergency department at the same Slough hospital and saw a doctor. The NHS Foundation Trust said it would make a further statement once it had spoken to Ms Loredana and completed an investigation into the case.

Wearable tech aids stroke patientsUS scientists develop sensors to allow doctors to follow their patients' progress away from the clinic.,"This video can not be played Wearable tech could help stroke patients Scientists in the US are developing wearable sensors to speed up the recovery of stroke patients. The sensors are able to send information to doctors continuously. The team developing the system says it could allow therapists to more closely monitor the effectiveness of their care. Details of the study were released at the recent annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in Texas. Lizzy McAninch had a stroke two years ago. She could not move or speak or swallow for several weeks. Lizzy is testing out wearable sensors that might speed her recovery. They look like small white sticking plasters, but they send information wirelessly to her medical team. She is a doctor herself and can see how they could help her. They look like small sticking plasters ""This technology to put sensors on the body to assess which muscle groups work or not can really pinpoint the areas affected by the stroke and can target therapies to specifically improve those issues,"" she told BBC News. The sensors continue to send back readings even after she has finished her exercises. This means that her therapist Kristen Hohl, from the Shirley Ryan AbilityLab in Chicago, can monitor her progress at home. ""As a therapist, I think about what my patients are doing at home. Are they able to carry through the recommendations I'm giving them as a therapist to do more? Do we see that they are walking more or do we see them engaging in conversations? ""Those are the types of things that I can get feedback from the sensors where currently I have to rely on what they tell me they have done."" The team is gathering large amounts of data The challenge for the scientists was to pack a lot of electronics on to a small flexible material and still make it comfortable for the patient to wear for a long time. ""It is almost mechanically imperceptible to the patient who is wearing the device,"" according to John Rogers, of Northwestern University in Chicago, who developed the sensors. ""And you can embed all sorts of advanced sensor functionality, microprocessor computing capability, power supplies and WiFi into this very unusual platform, and that is the uniqueness of what we do."" By the end of this year, the research team will have more information than ever before on stroke recovery. The scientists believe that their study could transform the way patients are treated in the future.

Red Cross staff paid for sexual servicesThe humanitarian aid agency reveals 21 staff have left for sexual misconduct since 2015.10h10 hours agoEurope,"The ICRC launched an internal review after reports of misconduct at aid agencies The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) says 21 members of staff have left their jobs for sexual misconduct in the last three years. The ICRC's director-general, Yves Daccord, said the individuals had paid for ""sexual services"" and had resigned or were dismissed from the aid agency. Mr Daccord said on Friday that it was ""a difficult but important day"". The revelations come as the aid sector has been hit by numerous allegations of sex abuse and exploitation by workers. Mr Daccord said that it was the recent reports of sexual misconduct from humanitarian agencies that had spurred the Geneva-based ICRC to conduct an internal review. Its code of conduct has explicitly forbidden the purchase of sexual services since 2006. Friday's statement follows reports that Plan International, a children's aid agency, confirmed six cases of sexual abuse and child exploitation by staff or associates. ""I have instructed my teams to scour the data we do have on sexual misconduct, and I can tell you that since 2015 we've identified 21 staff members who were either dismissed for paying for sexual services or resigned during an internal enquiry,"" Mr Daccord said. Plan International reveals child sex abuse cases How the Oxfam scandal unfolded Two other staff members who were suspected of sexual misconduct did not have their contracts renewed, Mr Daccord said, adding that he was ""deeply saddened to report these numbers"". He said that the ICRC, which has 17,000 members of staff worldwide, was concerned that incidents that should have been reported were not, or were not properly handled. ""This behaviour is a betrayal of the people and the communities we are there to serve,"" Mr Daccord said. ""It is against human dignity and we should have been more vigilant in preventing this."" The ICRC statement promises that all future allegations will be acted upon firmly and consistently, and that any employee found to have violated the ICRC's code of conduct will be held accountable. Ex-Save the Children boss resigns from Unicef Nine charts that show what aid agencies do International aid organisations have come under scrutiny sinceUK newspaper The Times reported earlier this month that Oxfam GB had covered up claims of sexual misconduct,externalby its staff in Haiti. On Friday, 22 aid organisations said they were ""truly sorry"" for the sector's failings in the wake of allegations of sexual misconduct by workers. In a letter signed by chief executives,agencies including Save the Children UK and Oxfam GB vowed to do more to protect those they were set up to help.

Airlines drop NRA after school shooting,"Students have been at the forefront of new calls for gun control in the US Two major US airlines have joined a growing list of companies to cut ties with the National Rifle Association following the Florida school shooting. United and Delta airlines have both announced they are ending discounts for NRA members. The killing of 17 people in Florida has revived the gun control debate in the US, with student survivors playing a leading role in calling for change. Firms with links to the US gun lobby have faced calls for a boycott. Activists have flooded the NRA's corporate partners with comments on social media under the hashtag #BoycottNRA. Trump: Florida school officer 'didn't have the courage' US gun control: What is the NRA and why is it so powerful? Six radical ways to tackle US school shootings The suspect in the attack, Nikolas Cruz, was said to be obsessed with guns and bought the semi-automatic rifle he allegedly used at the school in Parkland legally last year while aged 18. United and Delta airlines were the latest firms on Saturday to drop their ties to the powerful gun advocacy organisation. Between them they fly more than 300 million passengers a year.

Other firms dropping ties to the NRA include: Enterprise Holdings, which owns rental car brands Alamo, Enterprise and National, said discounts offered to NRA members would end on 26 March Another car rental firm,Hertz, also said it was ending discounts offered to NRA members The family-ownedFirst National Bank of Omahasaid it would not renew NRA-branded credit cards, citing ""customer feedback"" Insurance firmChubbsaid it had stopped underwriting an NRA-branded insurance policy three months ago Software firmSymantecsaid it had stopped its discount programme with the NRA Two removal firms,Allied Van LinesandNorthAmerican Van Lines, ended their affiliate relationship with the NRA and asked for their details to be removed from its website InsurerMetLife Incalso cut ties. The NRA, which claims five million members, did not respond to a request for comment about the effect of the boycott. The group defended itself in comments on Twitter, saying people upset about the shooting should focus on lapses by law enforcement. ""Instead of placing the blame on an organization that defends everyone's #2A rights, maybe people should take a hard look at the number of failures by the FBI and local law enforcement agencies, or does that not fit your agenda?"" it wrote,external, referring to the constitutional amendment that protects gun rights. This video can not be played Seven things the NRA blames after Florida NRA chief executive Wayne LaPierre spoke out on Thursday, arguing that ""opportunists"" were using the 14 February tragedy to expand gun control and abolish US gun rights. ""They hate the NRA. They hate the second amendment. They hate individual freedom,"" he said. Prior campaigns aimed at the NRA have had limited results. The US is no stranger to school shootings, but the response of students who survived the attack on Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School appears to have given fresh impetus to attempts to strengthen gun control. A marketing professor, Scott Galloway, told NBC Newsthat in dropping ties to the NRA, companies were calculating what would be in the best interests of their business,external. ""The most valuable person in world of consumer business is an 18 year old. Their recent galvanization against the issue has made the NRA very uncool,"" he said.

UN approves 30-day ceasefire in Syria,"This video can not be played Rawaa has been living in a basement with around 75 others for months The UN Security Council has unanimously approved a resolution demanding a 30-day ceasefire in Syria to allow aid deliveries and medical evacuations. However, some of the biggest jihadist rebel groups, and their associates, are not covered by the truce, raising questions about its real impact. The Eastern Ghouta rebel enclave near Damascus has been bombarded by government forces for the past week. And air strikes began soon after the vote in New York, activists said. The vote had been delayed several times since Thursday as members struggled to come to an agreement. Russia, an ally of Syria's government, wanted changes, while Western diplomats accused Moscow of stalling for time. Some 500 people are said to have been killed by government forces in the enclave since last Sunday while rebels fire on Damascus has reportedly killed at least 16 civilians. Life in Eastern Ghouta - read residents' stories Syria conflict: Will powers end up in direct war? Why is there a war in Syria? The draft had said the ceasefire would not apply to operations against the Islamic State (IS) group, al-Qaeda and the Nusra Front. The Nusra Front isa former al-Qaeda affiliate in Syria which changed its name to Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) when it formed an alliance with other militants last year. After Russia asked for the resolution to include other groups ""co-operating with them"", the final text specifies that operations may continue against ""individuals, groups, undertakings and entities"" associated with IS, al-Qaeda or other groups designated by the Security Council as terrorists. The US ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, called for the ceasefire to be implemented immediately but said she was sceptical that Syria would comply. She accused Russia of having ""dragged out the negotiations"". She said: ""In the three days it took us to adopt this resolution, how many mothers lost their kids to the bombing and the shelling?"" France's UN representative, FranÃ§ois Delattre, also said the action was very ""belated"". On Friday he said failure to act could spell the end of the UN itself. Its UN envoy, Vassily Nebenzia, said the ceasefire would not be possible without agreements between warring factions and he attacked what he said was propaganda over the situation in the rebel-held Eastern Ghouta. ""We know that the humanitarian situation in Syria is dire and requires urgent measures to be taken,"" he said. ""It is important to engage not just with Eastern Ghouta,"" he added. ""Assistance needs to be delivered to all parts of Syria."" UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has said the situation in the Eastern Ghouta is like ""hell on Earth"". Children have been injured in the bombardment of the Eastern Ghouta Air strikes resumed on Sunday, hours after the Security Council meeting. They targeted the outskirts of Douma, the main town in the Easter Ghouta, causing several casualties, observers said. The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights has said that both Syrian and Russian planes have been used, although Russia denies direct involvement. Barrel bombs and shells have been dropped on the area, where some 393,000 people remain trapped. Aid groups report several hospitals being put out of action since Sunday. The Syrian government has denied targeting civilians and said it is trying to liberate the Eastern Ghouta from ""terrorists"" - a term it has used to describe both the jihadist militants and the mainstream rebel groups that hold the enclave. The rebels in Eastern Ghouta are not one cohesive group. They encompass multiple factions, including jihadists, and in-fighting between them has led to past losses of ground to the Syrian government. The two biggest groups in the area are Jaish al-Islam and its rival Faylaq al-Rahman. The latter has in the past fought alongside Hayat Tahrir al-Sham. The Syrian government says its attempts to recapture Eastern Ghouta are directly due to the HTS presence there.

How to tackle school attacks,"Students from Stoneman Douglas High School attend a memorial following the shooting After 17 people were killed in Florida, could these measures stop US school shootings? In January 2014, Dr Sherry Towers went to a meeting at Purdue University, Indiana. On the same day, elsewhere on campus, Cody Cousins shot dead Andrew Boldt, a fellow student. After the killing, the meeting was cancelled. But Dr Towers - a statistician from Arizona State University - started thinking about shootings, and the relationship between them. ""It was the third school shooting I heard about in a 10-day period,"" she says. ""And that seemed - even for the US - an unusually large number."" Dr Towers and her team got to work, and found that school shootings and mass killings had anaverage ""contagious period"",externalof 13 days. That is - when one school shooting or mass killing happens, another becomes more likely. Dr Towers does not want the media to ignore mass killings. ""People have a right to know,"" she says. And, as a scientist, she cannot prove that withholding the killer's name will reduce contagion. ""It would be impossible [to prove] - there has never been a case where the killer wasn't named."" But she thinks that focusing on victims - rather than ""lurid"" details of the killer - could make shootings less likely. ""When I talk publicly, or to the media, I don't name the perpetrator unless there is a specific reason why,"" she says. This video can not be played Should we name school killers? Dr Towers' research has been used byAlerrt, a team at Texas State University,externalthat studies ""active shooter response"". They have a campaign calledDon't Name Them,external. ""A lot of shooters - not all of them - are driven by this desire for notoriety,"" says Dr Pete Blair from Alerrt. ""If we know that's one of the motivations, why are you giving them the reward?"" Dr Blair doesn't want a ban on naming shooters. But he thinks the media should focus on ""heroes, the community, and - where appropriate - the victims"". Some US journalists - such as CNN's Anderson Cooper - and websites nowchoose not to name mass killers,external. The shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School, in December 2012, was reported to police at 9.35am. Officers arrived less than four minutes later; within a minute, they heard the gunman shoot himself. He had already killed 20 children and six adults inside the school. ""If schools' only solution is to rely on outside help, it will never get any better than we saw at Sandy Hook,"" says Joe Eaton. Eaton is from the Buckeye Firearms Association, a gun-owners' group in Ohio. After Sandy Hook, they set up Faster - a programme thattrains teachers to respond to mass shootings,external. The programme includes first aid, moving through crowds, and firearms training - that is, how to kill a school gunman. So far, Faster has trained 1,300 school staff, mostly on three-day courses. ""Teachers, administrators, superintendents, bus drivers, even the lunch lady,"" says Eaton. Teachers take part in the Faster active shooter training in Colorado in 2017 In the US, 10 statesban guns in schools, outright,external. Another eight allow them only in locked cars. But in the other 32 states, it is possible for teachers to carry guns, if the school allows it. Faster has trained staff from 225 districts in 12 states. Another 200 to 400 will be trained this year. ""Inside of every school, there are certain teachers who will willingly run towards the sound of gunfire,"" says Eaton. ""The schools identify these people, and tell them: 'Whatever tool and training you're comfortable with, we're going to give it to you'."" Eaton accepts that it's sad for teachers to need guns. ""When they started their teaching career, they never would have imagined carrying firearms to protect kids - or having their schools ask them to,"" he says. ""But I bet if you ask every airline pilot, they would have answered the same way until 9/11 happened [some pilots in the US carry guns,external]. ""Sandy Hook was the teachers' 9/11."" Is it time for US teachers to carry guns? This video can not be played As a gunman opened fire in a Florida high school, students inside reached for their phones. When the gunman attacked Stoneman Douglas High School last week, David Hoggtook shelter in a cooking classroom. While hiding in the dark, the 17-year-old noticed the L-shaped room had two doors. ""If he [the gunman] came in one,"" he thought, ""we could go out the other."" His thinking - and his logic - is supported by experts. ""Attacks with high casualty counts [tend to have] people trapped in a small area, unable to protect themselves,"" says Dr Pete Blair from Alerrt. ""Simple things, like designing classrooms with another exit, could help. It might not necessarily stop the attack from happening - although it could - but it might mitigate the damage done."" He also suggests having locks on every door. ""I'm not big on trying to legislate things, but it's certainly something that would make sense,"" he says. This video can not be played A guide to the weapons available in the US and the rate at which they fire In May 2014, Elliot Rodger - a London-born 22-year-old - killed six people in Isla Vista, California. The local sheriff called him ""severely mentally disturbed"". Four months later, Californian lawmakers approved Gun Violence Restraining Orders. They allow family members, housemates, or police, to ask a judge to remove guns from people ""in crisis"". In California, there arethree types of order,external- two of them last 21 days, while another lasts a year. In the first year, 86 orders were issued. Federal law already stops people with mental health historiesbuyingguns - but the bar is lower. To buy a gun from a licensed dealer in the US, the purchaser must pass abackground check,external. If they have been judged ""mentally defective"", or committed to a mental institution, they fail. Between November 1998 and January 2018, there were33,569 denials for mental reasons,external- 2% of the total number of denials. TheCoalition to Stop Gun Violence,externalwants California's scheme to be introduced nationwide. So far, similar schemes have been approved in two more states - Oregon and Washington. A school shooting comes to 'paradise' Trump pushes for ban on modified guns Two days after the shooting in Florida, a lawyer in Corbin, Kentucky, posteda video on Facebook,external. Shane Romines offered $20,000 (Â£14,000) to buy five metal detectors - one for each school in the area. He also offered another $5,000 for tasers, firearms, and training, and called on other community leaders to contribute. Within three days, $75,000 had been pledged. Some US schools, mostly in big cities, already have metal detectors. In 2014, around8.7% of high schools,externalused ""random metal detector checks"". Butschool security expert Ken Trump,externaldoubts whether metal detectors will stop school shootings. ""It may meet an emotional need,"" he says. ""It's not going to meet a practical need."" He points out that schools are often open all day, every day. ""So you'd have to run a metal detector operation 24/7,"" says Trump. ""Or someone could come for a basketball game in the evening, stash the weapons in a locker, then come back the next morning."" Trump has worked in school security for 30 years. ""I'm a parent, I get it,"" he says. ""But there is no magic wand. This is complex."" Gun-owners' rights are protected by the US Constitution. The Second Amendment, adopted in 1791, gives Americans the right to ""keep and bear arms"". The Constitution, though, can be altered. Amendments can be proposed by Congress - when two-thirds of both houses are in favour - or by two-thirds of the states. The amendment must then be approved by three-quarters of states. For example, the Eighteenth Amendment prohibited alcohol. The Twenty-First Amendment repealed it. This video can not be played What has Donald Trump said about guns and gun control? Since the Florida shootings, some commentators have called for the Second Amendment to be repealed. ""Most gun-control legislation is ineffective when most Americans have a guaranteed constitutional right to purchase deadly weaponry in nearly unlimited quantities,"" wrote Bret Stephens inthe New York Times,external. But it isn't just the national constitution that gives Americans gun rights. Forty-fourstate constitutions,externalalso give people the right to bear arms. And - even if the Second Amendment were repealed - it wouldn't mean that guns were banned. It would simply remove the constitutional right to ""keep and bear arms"".

Life in besieged Ghouta,"The UN has accused the Syrian government of a ""monstrous campaign of annihilation"" A four-day-long bombardment by Syrian government forces is reported to have killed more than 300 civilians in the rebel-held Eastern Ghouta area. Here, people living there tell their stories. The enclave - home to an estimated 393,000 people - has been under siege since 2013. But pro-government media say a major military operation might soon begin to clear rebel factions from their last major stronghold near the capital Damascus. The relentless air and artillery strikes are leaving civilians, particularly women and children, in a state of fear and forcing them to seek shelter underground, where they are largely deprived of food and sanitation. ""We are living in a basement, underneath a half-destroyed house,"" Asia, a 28-year-old student and mother-of-three whose husband was killed in an attack while he was on his way to work, told the BBC. ""My daughter is sick. Her hair is falling out because she is so afraid."" Activists say residential areas across the Eastern Ghouta have been deliberately targeted The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group, says the government and its allies have carried out more than 1,290 air strikes on the Eastern Ghouta and fired 6,190 rockets and shells at the region since mid-November, when hostilities between government and rebel forces escalated. Between Sunday and Wednesday alone there were reportedly about 420 air strikes, and 140 barrel bombs were dropped by helicopters. UN war crimes experts are also investigating several reports of rockets allegedly containing chlorine being fired at the Eastern Ghouta this year. The recent surge in casualties means that more than 1,070 civilians, including several hundred children and women, have been killed and 3,900 injured in the past three months, according to the Syrian Observatory. Mouayad, a 29-year-old graduate with two young children, told the BBC: ""You cannot imagine how hard it is. ""For these kids to live their childhood in safety you have to keep them in the basement. They cannot get out, play in the garden, or anything else."" Satellite imagery analysis by UN experts in December identified approximately3,853 destroyed, 5,141 severely damaged and 3,547 moderately damaged buildings,externalin the more densely-populated western parts of the enclave. In the suburb of Ain Tarma, where between 17,000 and 20,000 civilians are believed to live, 71% of structures are damaged or destroyed, according to the analysis. In the neighbouring Jobar, where only rebels remain, the figure is 91%. The Syrian government says it is targeting ""terrorists"" and not civilians The Ghouta is the name given to the agricultural belt that runs around the east, south and west of Damascus. It includes suburbs of the capital, as well as a number of outlying towns and villages. Rare aid delivery reaches Syrian enclave Why is there a war in Syria? People living in the Ghouta were among those who took part in the peaceful pro-democracy uprising against President Bashar al-Assad in 2011. When the uprising evolved into a civil war, the region became a rebel stronghold. In 2012, government forces began to besiege parts of the Ghouta. The following year, they were accused by Western powers of firing rockets filled with the nerve agent Sarin at several rebel-held areas in the region, killing hundreds of people. Mr Assad denied the charge, blaming rebel fighters. As the president and his allies, Russia and Iran, gained an upper hand in the war over the last three years, they became determined to regain control of the Ghouta. The sieges were tightened, deliveries of humanitarian aid were limited, and the bombardment was stepped up. The UN expressed outrage at the so-called ""starve-and-surrender"" tactics, but the government continued. In late 2016, residents of the last rebel-held towns in the Western Ghouta surrendered. However, the Eastern Ghouta held out. Many people there were able to obtain essential foodstuffs via an informal tunnel network connecting the Eastern Ghouta with neighbouring government-controlled districts of Damascus, as well as from traders who had arrangements with troops. But last year, the government closed many tunnels and limited trade.From September until the end of November, no commercial vehicles were permitted to enter the Eastern Ghouta at all,external, according to the Reach Initiative, which is in touch with people on the ground to gather humanitarian information. People reportedly go days without eating, consume non-edible plants, or reduce meal sizes Limited deliveries resumed in December, but the restrictions led to the exhaustion of food supplies and extremely inflated prices. Humanitarian organisations were prevented by the government from delivering aid in December and January, although one convoy carrying assistance for 7,200 people reached Nashabiya in mid-February. ""There are some dealers. They provide the Ghouta with flour, rice, sugar,"" said Mouayad. ""But even the dealers... are stopped right now from entering or exiting."" Today,a bundle of bread costs close to 22 times the national average,external, according to the UN. Malnutrition rates have reached unprecedented levels, with 11.9% of children under five years old acutely malnourished. The government has allowed one aid convoy into the Eastern Ghouta since late November Residents told Reach that they went days without eating, consumed non-edible plants, or reduced the size of their meals due to a lack of access to food. ""For my three-year-old son, I make bread. For my daughter, I search for a cow to bring milk,"" Mouayad said. ""I am an educated person. I can get money for my children. Other people, other families, cannot do that."" Even then, Mouayad explained that he had only enough money to pay for food for his own family for a few days more. He did not know what he would do after that. Asia does not have a job and cannot afford to buy much food when she is able to venture outside. Her father and brother are both dead. ""I receive money for my children from an organisation helping orphans, but unfortunately I do not have enough,"" she said. This video can not be played Young children have been found buried in the rubble Access to healthcare has also been severely limited by the siege and bombardment. Last month, a total of 29 primary healthcare facilities, hospitals, informal emergency care points and mobile clinics were still operating, Reach said. But since Sunday night, 14 medical facilities have been taken out of service as a result of government attacks, according to Dr Ahmad Dbis of the Union of Medical Care and Relief Organizations (UOSSM), which operates hospitals there. More than 10 medical staff and volunteers have also been killed and 20 injured. Dr Dbis said medics were being forced to sleep at the hospitals because it was too dangerous to leave. Ambulances were also unable to transport patients because they were being intentionally targeted by aircraft, he added. Doctors are having to treat wounded people with limited medical supplies and equipment He recalled how he had been in contact with his friend,UOSSM photographer Abdoulrahman Ismael,external, on Tuesday shortly before he was killed in an air strike. ""I heard the sound of bombs. I asked him 'what was that?' And he said there were barrel bombs 200m away. I asked him whether he was in a safe place. ""He said 'Yes, I am in a medical centre in Hamouria. I think it is safe.' Four minutes later, his internet connection went dead."" Dr Dbis said the situation was so bad in the Eastern Ghouta that doctors were only treating emergency cases. They also have to cope without key supplies, including anaesthetics, antibiotics, blood transfusion bags and clean bandages. Hundreds of critically sick and wounded patients are also in need of urgent medical evacuation for life-saving treatment. Twenty-nine were evacuated at the end of December, but the UN said another 22 died while awaiting permission to leave. A hospital in the town of Hamouria was bombed on Tuesday The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid Raad Al Hussein, has urged the international community to take concerted action to stop what he called a ""monstrous campaign of annihilation"". The government and its allies have denied attacking civilians and rejected calls for a ceasefire or humanitarian pause. They say they are trying to liberate the Eastern Ghouta from ""terrorists"" and stop mortar and rocket attacks on neighbouring government-controlled areas, which have reportedly killed 113 civilians since mid-November. That has left many fearing that there will be a bloody battle like that seen in East Aleppo in late 2016, when rebels and civilians were bombed into submission. ""I hope that we can leave the Eastern Ghouta because we cannot bear any more of this,"" said Asia. Mouayad said he tried to escape the siege five years ago but failed. ""Unfortunately, my situation is now between fire and knife. Fire from bombing and shelling here in Eastern Ghouta. And the knife - terrorism in Syria from al-Qaeda or IS. There is no safe exit."" ""I want peace for my country. I want to raise my children in a respectful way. I want them to live in peace in any possible way. I want safety for my children,"" he added.

Syria air strikes 'kill 500' in a week,"The Eastern Ghouta has seen one of fiercest assaults of the Syrian war over the past week Syrian government forces have killed more than 500 civilians during a week of intense bombardment of a rebel enclave near Damascus, activists say. The victims in the Eastern Ghouta include 121 children, says the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based group monitoring the conflict. Syrian government forces backed by Russia have been pounding the area since last Sunday. The UN Security Council is struggling to agree on a ceasefire resolution. A vote has been delayed several times since Thursday, and a council meeting is under way. On Saturday, the Syrian Observatory said at least 29 civilians were killed, including 17 in the main town, Douma - bringing the total to over 500 for the week. The group said the strikes were being carried out by both Syrian and Russian planes - although Russia denies direct involvement. This video can not be played ""At least in heaven there's food"": The children caught up in Eastern Ghouta air strikes Barrel bombs and shell fire have been dropped on the area, where some 393,000 people remain trapped. Aid groups report several hospitals being put out of action since Sunday. The Syrian government has denied targeting civilians and said it is trying to liberate the Eastern Ghouta from ""terrorists"" - a term it has used to describe both the jihadist militants and the mainstream rebel groups that hold the enclave. The plight of civilians in the area has alarmed world leaders. Conditions there have been described as ""hell on earth"" by UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres. The Security Council has been debating a resolution calling for a 30-day calm to allow for aid deliveries. But Russia wants changes. Under current draft, any ceasefire would not apply to the Islamic State group, or the Nusra Front - formerly al-Qaeda's official affiliate in Syria. Moscow says it must go further and exclude other groups ""co-operating with them"" and which have shelled Damascus. This video can not be played Eastern Ghouta resident: ""Missiles are dropping like rain"" Western diplomats have accused Russia of stalling for time. They suspect that Moscow wants to give Syria time to deal a final blow to forces defending the enclave on the edge of Damascus. On Friday evening US President Donald Trump pointed the finger of blame firmly at Syria and its allies, Russia and Iran, for the humanitarian crisis. The rebels in Eastern Ghouta are not one cohesive group. They encompass multiple factions, including jihadists, and in-fighting between them has led to past loses of ground to the Syrian government. The two biggest groups in the area are Jaish al-Islam and its rival Faylaq al-Rahman. The latter has in the past fought alongside the jihadist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham - an alliance of factions led by the Nusra Front, which sprung from al-Qaeda. The Syrian government is desperate to regain the territory, because it says the rebels are directly endangering the capital. Eastern Ghouta is so close that it is possible for rebels to fire mortars into the heart of Damascus, which has also led to civilian deaths. Syrian state media said rebels have killed at least 16 civilians in eastern districts of the city since Sunday.

Airlines abandon NRA after school shooting,"Students have been at the forefront of new calls for gun control in the US Two major US airlines have joined a growing list of companies to cut ties with the National Rifle Association following the Florida school shooting. United and Delta airlines have both announced they are ending discounts for NRA members. The killing of 17 people in Florida has revived the gun control debate in the US, with student survivors playing a leading role in calling for change. Firms with links to the US gun lobby have faced calls for a boycott. Activists have flooded the NRA's corporate partners with comments on social media under the hashtag #BoycottNRA. Trump: Florida school officer 'didn't have the courage' US gun control: What is the NRA and why is it so powerful? Six radical ways to tackle US school shootings The suspect in the attack, Nikolas Cruz, was said to be obsessed with guns and bought the semi-automatic rifle he allegedly used at the school in Parkland legally last year while aged 18. United and Delta airlines were the latest firms on Saturday to drop their ties to the powerful gun advocacy organisation. Between them they fly more than 300 million passengers a year.

The NRA, which claims five million members, did not respond to a request for comment about the effect of the boycott. The group defended itself in comments on Twitter, saying people upset about the shooting should focus on lapses by law enforcement. ""Instead of placing the blame on an organization that defends everyone's #2A rights, maybe people should take a hard look at the number of failures by the FBI and local law enforcement agencies, or does that not fit your agenda?"" it wrote,external, referring to the constitutional amendment that protects gun rights. This video can not be played Seven things the NRA blames after Florida NRA chief executive Wayne LaPierre spoke out on Thursday, arguing that ""opportunists"" were using the 14 February tragedy to expand gun control and abolish US gun rights. ""They hate the NRA. They hate the second amendment. They hate individual freedom,"" he said. Prior campaigns aimed at the NRA have had limited results. The US is no stranger to school shootings, but the response of students who survived the attack on Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School appears to have given fresh impetus to attempts to strengthen gun control. A marketing professor, Scott Galloway, told NBC Newsthat in dropping ties to the NRA, companies were calculating what would be in the best interests of their business,external.

UK ticket holder wins Â£78m on EuromillionsThe British winner split the Â£156m jackpot with another ticket holder from Spain,"A UK ticket holder has won almost Â£78m after matching all seven numbers in Friday night's Euromillions draw. The lucky entrant was one of just two that matched all the numbers and has come forward to claim a half-share of the almost Â£156m rollover jackpot. The prize had been growing for eight weeks, since 29 December, and came close to matching the Â£170m record set in October. Friday's other jackpot winner was from Spain. The numbers drawn were 10, 17, 18, 28, 47 while the Lucky Stars were 3 and 7. ""What a win for one lucky UK ticket holder,"" said a National Lottery spokesperson.

Firms cut NRA ties amid Florida backlashA growing number of corporate partners abandon the US gun lobby after the deadly school shooting.2h2 hours agoBusiness,"Activists are putting pressure on companies with ties to the NRA, a powerful gun lobby A growing number of companies have cut ties with the National Rifle Association amid calls for a boycott of businesses linked to the US gun lobby after the Florida school shooting. United and Delta airlines joined car rental giants Hertz and Enterprise in ending discounts for NRA members. The murder of 17 people has prompted renewed calls for tighter gun controls. Florida Republican Governor Rick Scott has backed calls to raise the minimum age for buying a gun from 18 to 21. Mr Scott has been widely seen as an ally of the NRA who has previously opposed stricter laws in the state. However, he has come under mounting pressure to respond to the demands of students who survived the shootings at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. Activists have tried to put pressure on the NRA since the shooting by targeting firms that offer discounts and other benefits to its members. They have flooded its corporate partners with comments on social media under the hashtag #BoycottNRA. Firms under pressure include delivery company FedEx and tech giants such as Amazon, which distributes NRA television programmes.

The NRA, which claims five million members, shot back at those corporations on Saturday, saying the moves punished the organisation's members in a ""shameful display of political and civic cowardice"". ""In time, these brands will be replaced by others who recognize that patriotism and determined commitment to Constitutional freedoms are characteristics of a marketplace they very much want to serve,""the NRA said,external. ""Let it be absolutely clear. The loss of a discount will neither scare nor distract one single NRA member from our mission to stand and defend the individual freedoms that have always made America the greatest nation in the world."" The NRA has previously said people upset about the shooting should focus on lapses by law enforcement and mental health professionals.

On Friday, the governor of Florida urged state lawmakers to restrict access to firearms for young people and the mentally ill. Rick Scott said his aim was for Florida to ""require all individuals purchasing firearms to be 21 or older,"" adding that the he wanted to make it ""virtually impossible"" for anyone with mental health issues to acquire a gun. Mr Trump earlier said he supported the proposal to raise the age at which a person can buy a gun from 18, and said he believed the NRA would back such a proposal. ""I don't think I'll be going up against them,"" Mr Trump said of the gun lobby. ""They're good people.""

Red Cross staff paid for sexual services,"The ICRC launched an internal review after reports of misconduct at aid agencies The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) says 21 members of staff have left their jobs for sexual misconduct in the last three years. The ICRC's director-general, Yves Daccord, said the individuals had paid for ""sexual services"" and had resigned or were dismissed from the aid agency. Mr Daccord said on Friday that it was ""a difficult but important day"". The revelations come as the aid sector has been hit by numerous allegations of sex abuse and exploitation by workers. Mr Daccord said that it was the recent reports of sexual misconduct from humanitarian agencies that had spurred the Geneva-based ICRC to conduct an internal review. Its code of conduct has explicitly forbidden the purchase of sexual services since 2006. Friday's statement follows reports that Plan International, a children's aid agency, confirmed six cases of sexual abuse and child exploitation by staff or associates. ""I have instructed my teams to scour the data we do have on sexual misconduct, and I can tell you that since 2015 we've identified 21 staff members who were either dismissed for paying for sexual services or resigned during an internal enquiry,"" Mr Daccord said. Plan International reveals child sex abuse cases How the Oxfam scandal unfolded Two other staff members who were suspected of sexual misconduct did not have their contracts renewed, Mr Daccord said, adding that he was ""deeply saddened to report these numbers"". He said that the ICRC, which has 17,000 members of staff worldwide, was concerned that incidents that should have been reported were not, or were not properly handled. ""This behaviour is a betrayal of the people and the communities we are there to serve,"" Mr Daccord said. ""It is against human dignity and we should have been more vigilant in preventing this."" The ICRC statement promises that all future allegations will be acted upon firmly and consistently, and that any employee found to have violated the ICRC's code of conduct will be held accountable. Ex-Save the Children boss resigns from Unicef Nine charts that show what aid agencies do International aid organisations have come under scrutiny sinceUK newspaper The Times reported earlier this month that Oxfam GB had covered up claims of sexual misconduct,externalby its staff in Haiti. On Friday, 22 aid organisations said they were ""truly sorry"" for the sector's failings in the wake of allegations of sexual misconduct by workers. In a letter signed by chief executives,agencies including Save the Children UK and Oxfam GB vowed to do more to protect those they were set up to help.

Pair in court over 'hit-and-run' deathsA man and woman are charged with causing the deaths of brothers Corey and Casper Platt-May in Coventry.5h5 hours agoCoventry & Warwickshire,"Corey (left) and Casper Platt-May were hit by a car on Thursday A man and woman have appeared in court charged with causing the death of two young brothers by dangerous driving, following a suspected hit-and-run crash in Coventry.

Big freeze pushes up wholesale gas priceA cold snap across Europe has led to a spike in wholesale energy prices over the past few weeks.17m18 minutes agoBusiness,"Household energy costs could rise after a surge in wholesale gas prices sparked by the recent cold weather in the UK. Wholesale gas prices - which are strongly linked to supply and demand - have increased by 21% since the start of February and 14% in the past week. Temperatures are expected to dip to -6C (21.2F) in parts of the UK, with the expected use of energy to heat homes likely to increase wholesale prices. The government plans to impose a cap on energy bills in the coming weeks. Wholesale gas cost 58p per therm (p/th) on Friday - up 14% since Monday - putting prices at a three-and-a-half year high. It follows a surge in wholesale prices last December when themajor Forties gas pipeline in Aberdeenshire shut, which carries crude North Sea oil. The UK isbraced for the coldest February week in five yearsas freezing air arrives from Russia. On Saturday, temperatures fell to -5.5C (22F) in Anglesey, north Wales, with the cold spell expected to intensify next week. The Met Office has issued ayellow warning,externalfor snow for Monday through to Wednesday, warning that persistent snow showers could disrupt road, rail and air travel. By BBC business correspondent Joe Lynam Oil prices collapsed by more than 50% in 2015, bringing down the wholesale cost of gas. But in recent weeks, that wholesale price has risen back to where it was nearly four years ago. When the price that companies pay each other for energy goes up, there's always a risk that they'll pass that on - in full - to households. But icy weather, even when it's cold enough to have its own name - the ""beast from the East"" - is temporary. Also, competition between British energy firms is so intense that no one wants to be the first to break cover and increase prices for customers. The other interesting actor in this pricing drama is the government.  It will publish legislation very soon allowing the regulator, Ofgem, to put a cap on so-called standard variable tariffs, the tariff paid by around two-thirds of households. Higher wholesale prices could drive up the cost of household heating, as well as the cost of electricity - since the price of electricity generated from gas power stations tends to set the wholesale cost of power paid to all generators. However, competition between energy suppliers could keep tariffs low, said Henry Edwardes-Evans, of energy commodities assessors Platts. He said wholesale gas prices have been climbing ahead of the big freeze, but adds it ""may be premature"" to assume household bills will go up straight away. Snowfall is expected to fall across parts of the UK next week He said: ""Suppliers need a sustained rise in wholesale prices to prompt that, especially in today's politically charged  - and very competitive - household tariff environment."" An influential committee of MPs have meanwhile called for the government's planned cap on energy billsto be introduced urgentlyto stop consumers from being overcharged. But Centrica, the UK's biggest energy company. said the proposed cap was one reason behind itsplans to shed 4,000 jobs. Energy bill price cap 'urgently needed' Spring 'postponed' as big freeze hits UK British Gas owner to cut 4,000 jobs Scottish Power loses 200,000 customers Energy switch trial to cut 50,000 bills Firefighters running out of water as wildfire declared most destructive in LA's history Moment friends abandon house as Palisades fire closes in 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?

Will powers end up in direct war?,"This video can not be played Eastern Ghouta resident: ""Missiles are dropping like rain"" Like all seemingly endless conflicts, the fighting in Syria long ago splintered into a number of mini wars. The original confrontation between the Syrian government and those trying to bring it down is now almost an irrelevance, with President Assad's position radically diminished but essentially unchallenged - while the very term rebel has become near-obsolete in the Syrian context. Syria war: Eastern Ghouta bombing 'catastrophic' Why is there a war in Syria? But where this might once have left a void, there is now a dizzying array of competing forces choking up the huge swathes of territory still beyond government control. The outside sponsors of those forces have moved through the years of the conflict from diplomacy to outright military intervention. Russia's air campaign to ""stabilise"" President Assad's government began in 2015 Russia and Iran are the most deeply invested - financially, politically and militarily. They have accordingly gained the most in power and influence, but lost the most in fighters on the battlefield, and in the massive economic cost of rescuing President Assad from defeat. Russia admits dozens of Russian casualties in Syria battle The Russian guns for hire dying in Syria The US has ventured far less, never fully committing to genuine support of the rebels beyond rhetoric and handouts. The result has been a vertiginous fall in its ability to call the shots, and a lack of clarity about its goals. Turkey has been another major player - originally in its support of the rebels, but more recently in its determination to stop Syrian Kurds from carving out a mini state on its border - by launching a major incursion into northern Syria. Turkey warns Syria against helping Kurds Syria conflict: US and Turkey agree to avert Manbij clash Syria war: Why Turkey's battle for northern Syria matters To the south, Israel has sat out most of the conflict, loath to be drawn in - to the disastrous extent that it was during the 16 years of the civil war in Syria's neighbour, Lebanon. It has mostly limited itself to targeted attacks on alleged Iranian bases and suspected Hezbollah arms supplies. Syria war: Israel 'strikes Damascus military complex' Through much of the conflict, the interests of these outside players were often opposed to each other - and the fact that their aims were mutually exclusive has ensured the failure of all attempts to end the war. But even as their interests have edged closer to collision, these outside powers have had the buffer of working through their proxy forces on the ground. When dangerous flashpoints have arisen, all sides have taken a step back to avoid further escalation, leaving Syrians - as ever - to suffer the consequences. The rise of the so-called Islamic State group (IS) may have introduced an even darker and more savage dimension to the conflict. But it also brought the temporary relief of a shared purpose in the effort to defeat the one combatant so iniquitous that almost every participant in the war finally saw it as their enemy. The US and the Russians and Iranians, the Turkish and the Kurds, even the regime, put their irreconcilable differences on hold just long enough to allow them to take on IS - if not as allies, at least not as battlefield rivals. The concerted power of the forces massed against IS inevitably proved too much for the jihadists, who lost their territory and returned to insurgency. But all the while this monumental battle was going on, it was actively creating new complications for the post-IS future. The Kurds with US backing took over more territory as they drove IS out - raising concern in Turkey over their growing power, to fever pitch. The Russians and Iranians entrenched themselves deeper in Syria - as the regime continued to recover more territory. After the defeat of IS, the US was left with little clarity to its mission in Syria - and even less influence. Israel saw battle-hardened Hezbollah and Iranian fighters move closer and closer to its border - prompting a more active, though still cautious, engagement in the conflict. Almost half of Syria's pre-war population of 23 million has been displaced by the war Talk of peace and de-escalation zones has grown in volume, but in many parts of Syria, it's still drowned out by the sound of shelling and aerial bombardment. It may seem strange to talk of instability in Syria as if it's some new element in the war. But the increasing international commitment on its various battlefields runs the risk of shifting it from a war between proxies to one directly between the powers pulling the strings. And that is a highly dangerous development. Recent events have shown that the limited comfort that those involved will always pull back from the brink of deeper confrontation, may not be entirely reliable. The Israeli F-16 jet crashed near a village in northern Israel An Israeli fighter jet was shot down over Israel by a Syrian missile,following the interception of an Iranian drone in Israeli airspace as part of a ratcheting up of tensions in the hitherto quieter south of Syria. This happened amid reports of the US killing Russian mercenaries advancing against a US-Kurdish base, even as Turkey's war on the Syrian Kurds pits it squarely against the Americans, who are its NATO allies. If nothing else, all this may only prolong the Syria war. But it raises fears of all-out confrontation between the outside players - all of whose interests remain as fundamentally opposed as they have been at any time in the conflict.

Firms cut NRA ties amid Florida backlash,"Activists are putting pressure on companies with ties to the NRA, a powerful gun lobby A growing number of companies have cut ties with the National Rifle Association amid calls for a boycott of businesses linked to the US gun lobby after the Florida school shooting. United and Delta airlines joined car rental giants Hertz and Enterprise in ending discounts for NRA members. The murder of 17 people has prompted renewed calls for tighter gun controls. Florida Republican Governor Rick Scott has backed calls to raise the minimum age for buying a gun from 18 to 21. Mr Scott has been widely seen as an ally of the NRA who has previously opposed stricter laws in the state. However, he has come under mounting pressure to respond to the demands of students who survived the shootings at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. Activists have tried to put pressure on the NRA since the shooting by targeting firms that offer discounts and other benefits to its members. They have flooded its corporate partners with comments on social media under the hashtag #BoycottNRA. Firms under pressure include delivery company FedEx and tech giants such as Amazon, which distributes NRA television programmes. Trump: Florida school officer 'didn't have the courage' US gun control: What is the NRA and why is it so powerful?

Enterprise Holdings, which owns the rental car brands Alamo, Enterprise and National, also said discounts offered to NRA members would end on 26 March.

Other companies distanced themselves from the NRA on Friday and Saturday.

Delta Air Lines and United followed suit on Saturday, saying that they would ask the NRA to remove their information from its website. Both airlines had been offering special flight discounts to NRA members travelling to the association's annual meeting in May. In Florida, the president of the Florida Education Association, which represents teachers' unions, also called on the state to look at pension holdings in gun companies ina statement to the Miami Herald newspaper,external. The NRA, which claims five million members, shot back at those corporations on Saturday, saying the moves punished the organisation's members in a ""shameful display of political and civic cowardice"". ""In time, these brands will be replaced by others who recognize that patriotism and determined commitment to Constitutional freedoms are characteristics of a marketplace they very much want to serve,""the NRA said,external. ""Let it be absolutely clear. The loss of a discount will neither scare nor distract one single NRA member from our mission to stand and defend the individual freedoms that have always made America the greatest nation in the world."" The NRA has previously said people upset about the shooting should focus on lapses by law enforcement and mental health professionals.

On Friday, the governor of Florida urged state lawmakers to restrict access to firearms for young people and the mentally ill. Rick Scott said his aim was for Florida to ""require all individuals purchasing firearms to be 21 or older,"" adding that the he wanted to make it ""virtually impossible"" for anyone with mental health issues to acquire a gun. Mr Trump earlier said he supported the proposal to raise the age at which a person can buy a gun from 18, and said he believed the NRA would back such a proposal. ""I don't think I'll be going up against them,"" Mr Trump said of the gun lobby. ""They're good people."" In other developments: It has emerged that an unidentified woman called the FBI on 5 January to say she was worried that Nikolas Cruz, the suspected gunman, would get into a school, ""shooting the place up"". The woman said the information had already been passed to police and she had not heard back Police have released previous recordings of 911 calls reportedly made by Nikolas Cruz,external,, in which he says that someone he was living with at the time was ""going to gut me"" President Trump said an armed officer stationed at the school who did not enter the building where the shooting was taking place was a ""coward"" CNN reports that in addition to the armed officer,three Broward County deputies were waiting outside the school doing nothing to confront the shooter,externalwhen Coral Springs police arrived This video can not be played As a gunman opened fire in a Florida high school, students inside reached for their phones. The campaign comes as US businesses increasingly find themselves entangled in political debates, as activists target them on issues such as LGBTQ rights, as well as ties to the president. Companies such asretailer Nordstromand sportswear brand Under Armour are among the firms that have been subject to calls for boycotts from the left and right. Executives serving on presidential councils, including the formerchief executive of Uber, have resigned from the advisory groups after consumer pressure.The councils eventually disbanded last summer.

Pair arrested in Kuwait frozen maid caseThe husband and wife employers of a Filipina maid found dead in a freezer are arrested in Syria.,"Ms Demafelis's sister cried over her casket upon its arrival in Manila last week The employers of a Filipina maid found dead in a freezer in Kuwait have been arrested in the Syrian capital Damascus after a manhunt lasting several weeks. Joanna Demafelis, 29, was found frozen in her employers' apartment more than a year after she was reported missing. Both Nader Essam Assaf and his Syrian wife Mona are being held on suspicion of murder, officials said on Saturday. Mr Assaf, who is a Lebanese national, was transferred to Beirut but his wife remains in custody in Damascus. On Saturday, a Lebanese judicial official said the couple had left Kuwait and made a ""very brief stopover"" in Lebanon before travelling on the neighbouring Syria. ""Lebanon has asked Kuwait to pass on [Mr Assaf's] police record,"" the official added. Ms Demafelis's death prompted outrage in the Philippines and a ban on Filipinos travelling to work in Kuwait. Both suspects became the subject of an international manhunt aided by Interpol. Philippines foreign secretary Alan Peter Cayetano welcomed the news of the arrests, calling it a ""critical first step in our quest for justice for Joanna"". Philippines stops workers going to Kuwait Singaporeans jailed for starving maid The country training people to leave The maid's body was found this month with apparent signs of torture, Philippine officials said, in an apartment that had apparently been abandoned for at least a year. In the aftermath of the discovery, Philippine authorities say they facilitated the return of more than 1,000 ""distressed overseas Filipino workers"" in Kuwait, most of whom had worked as household servants. The country's department of foreign affairs estimate that some 252,000 of its citizens are living and working there. Kuwaiti authorities, meanwhile, have vowed to do everything possible to see justice is done. Mr Cayetano said he expected Kuwaiti authorities to request the extradition of Mr Assaf from Lebanon, to stand trial in Kuwait.

Freezing temperatures push up gas prices,"Household energy costs could rise after a surge in wholesale gas prices sparked by the recent cold weather in the UK. Wholesale gas prices - which are strongly linked to supply and demand - have increased by 21% since the start of February and 14% in the past week. Temperatures are expected to dip to -6C (21.2F) in parts of the UK, with the expected use of energy to heat homes likely to increase wholesale prices. The government plans to impose a cap on energy bills in the coming weeks. Wholesale gas cost 58p per therm (p/th) on Friday - up 14% since Monday - putting prices at a three-and-a-half year high. It follows a surge in wholesale prices last December when themajor Forties gas pipeline in Aberdeenshire shut, which carries crude North Sea oil. The UK isbraced for the coldest February week in five yearsas freezing air arrives from Russia. On Saturday, temperatures fell to -5.5C (22F) in Anglesey, north Wales, with the cold spell expected to intensify next week. The Met Office has issued ayellow warning,externalfor snow for Monday through to Wednesday, warning that persistent snow showers could disrupt road, rail and air travel. By BBC business correspondent Joe Lynam Oil prices collapsed by more than 50% in 2015, bringing down the wholesale cost of gas. But in recent weeks, that wholesale price has risen back to where it was nearly four years ago. When the price that companies pay each other for energy goes up, there's always a risk that they'll pass that on - in full - to households. But icy weather, even when it's cold enough to have its own name - the ""beast from the East"" - is temporary. Also, competition between British energy firms is so intense that no one wants to be the first to break cover and increase prices for customers. The other interesting actor in this pricing drama is the government.  It will publish legislation very soon allowing the regulator, Ofgem, to put a cap on so-called standard variable tariffs, the tariff paid by around two-thirds of households. Higher wholesale prices could drive up the cost of household heating, as well as the cost of electricity - since the price of electricity generated from gas power stations tends to set the wholesale cost of power paid to all generators. However, competition between energy suppliers could keep tariffs low, said Henry Edwardes-Evans, of energy commodities assessors Platts. He said wholesale gas prices have been climbing ahead of the big freeze, but adds it ""may be premature"" to assume household bills will go up straight away. Snowfall is expected to fall across parts of the UK next week He said: ""Suppliers need a sustained rise in wholesale prices to prompt that, especially in today's politically charged  - and very competitive - household tariff environment."" An influential committee of MPs have meanwhile called for the government's planned cap on energy billsto be introduced urgentlyto stop consumers from being overcharged. But Centrica, the UK's biggest energy company. said the proposed cap was one reason behind itsplans to shed 4,000 jobs.

Pair arrested in Kuwait frozen maid case,"Ms Demafelis's sister cried over her casket upon its arrival in Manila last week The employers of a Filipina maid found dead in a freezer in Kuwait have been arrested in the Syrian capital Damascus after a manhunt lasting several weeks. Joanna Demafelis, 29, was found frozen in her employers' apartment more than a year after she was reported missing. Both Nader Essam Assaf and his Syrian wife Mona are being held on suspicion of murder, officials said on Saturday. Mr Assaf, who is a Lebanese national, was transferred to Beirut but his wife remains in custody in Damascus. On Saturday, a Lebanese judicial official said the couple had left Kuwait and made a ""very brief stopover"" in Lebanon before travelling on the neighbouring Syria. ""Lebanon has asked Kuwait to pass on [Mr Assaf's] police record,"" the official added. Ms Demafelis's death prompted outrage in the Philippines and a ban on Filipinos travelling to work in Kuwait. Both suspects became the subject of an international manhunt aided by Interpol. Philippines foreign secretary Alan Peter Cayetano welcomed the news of the arrests, calling it a ""critical first step in our quest for justice for Joanna"". Philippines stops workers going to Kuwait Singaporeans jailed for starving maid The country training people to leave The maid's body was found this month with apparent signs of torture, Philippine officials said, in an apartment that had apparently been abandoned for at least a year. In the aftermath of the discovery, Philippine authorities say they facilitated the return of more than 1,000 ""distressed overseas Filipino workers"" in Kuwait, most of whom had worked as household servants. The country's department of foreign affairs estimate that some 252,000 of its citizens are living and working there. Kuwaiti authorities, meanwhile, have vowed to do everything possible to see justice is done. Mr Cayetano said he expected Kuwaiti authorities to request the extradition of Mr Assaf from Lebanon, to stand trial in Kuwait.

Trump suggests officer a 'coward',"This video can not be played ""He didn't have the courage"" An armed officer who stood outside a Florida school where a gunman killed 17 people last week ""certainly did a poor job"", US President Donald Trump says. Deputy Scot Peterson resigned after an investigation found he failed to confront the suspect. Mr Trump said Mr Peterson might be a ""coward"" who ""didn't react properly under pressure"". Florida's governor meanwhile called for law enforcement officers to be placed in every public school in the state. This video can not be played How young conservatives view #NeverAgain Speaking to reporters outside the White House on Friday morning, President Trump criticised the police officer who did not confront the perpetrator of the 14 February massacre in Parkland, Florida. ""He trained his whole life but when it came time to do something he didn't have the courage,"" he said. Mourning for the shooting victims continued in Parkland on Friday ""He certainly did a poor job."" ""But that's a case where somebody was outside, they're trained, they didn't react properly under pressure or they were coward,"" he added. The Republican president later touted his love for gun rights on Friday at the Conservative Political Action Conference (Cpac) in Maryland. He again proposed arming teachers as a solution to school safety, a method long championed by the National Rifle Association (NRA) gun lobby. Facebook 'regret' over shooting game demo Activists target companies tied to NRA NRA under fire for Parks and Rec gif This video can not be played What the British think of arming teachers Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel revealed on Thursday that Mr Peterson, the 54-year-old school resource officer, stood outside while the alleged gunman shot students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. He said video footage showed Mr Peterson arriving at the building where the shooting broke out about 90 seconds after the first shots were fired, and that he remained outside for about four minutes. The attack lasted six minutes, Sheriff Israel said. ""I am devastated. Sick to my stomach. He never went in,"" Sheriff Israel said. Lawmaker: Many mass shooters are Democrats 'Arm me with anything but a gun' Asked what Mr Peterson should have done, Sheriff Israel said: ""Went in, addressed the killer, killed the killer."" Mr Peterson is yet to publicly comment on what happened. Officers are reportedly guarding his home. It is unclear if he will face charges. The suspect used a semi-automatic AR-15 rifle, police say, and escaped the scene before being captured later. School resource officers are sworn law enforcement officers who are responsible for safety and crime prevention in schools, although their exact roles differ from school to school and authority to authority. Employed by the local police or sheriff's office, they document incidents and can make arrests, as well as working on areas such as mentoring and education. This video can not be played As a gunman opened fire in a Florida high school, students inside reached for their phones. There are between 14,000 and 20,000 such officers in the US, according to the National Association of School Resource Officers. Mr Peterson had been in his position at the school since 2009, local media report. The Sun-Sentinel newspaper,externalsaid he had worked for the sheriff's office since 1985 and office records showed his salary for 2016 was $75,673 (Â£54,137). Concerns have been raised about both the school's video surveillance system and whether warnings about the former student charged with the massacre were ignored. It has been reported that the person watching the surveillance system was relaying information 20 minutes old to police, so officers believed the gunman was in a certain area when he was not. Calls were also reportedly made to the authorities in 2016 and 2017 expressing concern about the suspect, including one saying he was planning to attack the school. A transcript of one call to the FBI was released to US media on Frida,externaly, in which a tipster warns that Mr Cruz ""wants to kill people"" and that ""he's going to explode"". The female caller, whose identification was redacted in the report, said that Mr Cruz once brought a bird inside ""threw it on his mother's kitchen counter and he started cutting it up"". She also warned that Mr Cruz was receiving an inheritance of $25,000 per year, and that he may spend that money on guns. Governor Rick Scott called for ""active shooter training"" for all students and staff at public schools in the state. He said he planned to raise Florida's minimum age for buying guns to 21 years old. Governor Scott also pledged to make it ""virtually impossible for anyone who has mental health issues to use guns."" ""If a court involuntarily commits someone because they are a risk to themselves or others, they would be required to surrender all firearms and not regain the right to purchase or possess a firearm until a court hearing,"" he said during a speech about a new proposal on guns in Tallahassee.

Eating inedible plants to survive,"The UN has accused the Syrian government of a ""monstrous campaign of annihilation"" A four-day-long bombardment by Syrian government forces is reported to have killed more than 300 civilians in the rebel-held Eastern Ghouta area. Here, people living there tell their stories. The enclave - home to an estimated 393,000 people - has been under siege since 2013. But pro-government media say a major military operation might soon begin to clear rebel factions from their last major stronghold near the capital Damascus. The relentless air and artillery strikes are leaving civilians, particularly women and children, in a state of fear and forcing them to seek shelter underground, where they are largely deprived of food and sanitation. ""We are living in a basement, underneath a half-destroyed house,"" Asia, a 28-year-old student and mother-of-three whose husband was killed in an attack while he was on his way to work, told the BBC. ""My daughter is sick. Her hair is falling out because she is so afraid."" Activists say residential areas across the Eastern Ghouta have been deliberately targeted The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group, says the government and its allies have carried out more than 1,290 air strikes on the Eastern Ghouta and fired 6,190 rockets and shells at the region since mid-November, when hostilities between government and rebel forces escalated. Between Sunday and Wednesday alone there were reportedly about 420 air strikes, and 140 barrel bombs were dropped by helicopters. UN war crimes experts are also investigating several reports of rockets allegedly containing chlorine being fired at the Eastern Ghouta this year. The recent surge in casualties means that more than 1,070 civilians, including several hundred children and women, have been killed and 3,900 injured in the past three months, according to the Syrian Observatory. Mouayad, a 29-year-old graduate with two young children, told the BBC: ""You cannot imagine how hard it is. ""For these kids to live their childhood in safety you have to keep them in the basement. They cannot get out, play in the garden, or anything else."" Satellite imagery analysis by UN experts in December identified approximately3,853 destroyed, 5,141 severely damaged and 3,547 moderately damaged buildings,externalin the more densely-populated western parts of the enclave. In the suburb of Ain Tarma, where between 17,000 and 20,000 civilians are believed to live, 71% of structures are damaged or destroyed, according to the analysis. In the neighbouring Jobar, where only rebels remain, the figure is 91%. The Syrian government says it is targeting ""terrorists"" and not civilians The Ghouta is the name given to the agricultural belt that runs around the east, south and west of Damascus. It includes suburbs of the capital, as well as a number of outlying towns and villages. Rare aid delivery reaches Syrian enclave Why is there a war in Syria? People living in the Ghouta were among those who took part in the peaceful pro-democracy uprising against President Bashar al-Assad in 2011. When the uprising evolved into a civil war, the region became a rebel stronghold. In 2012, government forces began to besiege parts of the Ghouta. The following year, they were accused by Western powers of firing rockets filled with the nerve agent Sarin at several rebel-held areas in the region, killing hundreds of people. Mr Assad denied the charge, blaming rebel fighters. As the president and his allies, Russia and Iran, gained an upper hand in the war over the last three years, they became determined to regain control of the Ghouta. The sieges were tightened, deliveries of humanitarian aid were limited, and the bombardment was stepped up. The UN expressed outrage at the so-called ""starve-and-surrender"" tactics, but the government continued. In late 2016, residents of the last rebel-held towns in the Western Ghouta surrendered. However, the Eastern Ghouta held out. Many people there were able to obtain essential foodstuffs via an informal tunnel network connecting the Eastern Ghouta with neighbouring government-controlled districts of Damascus, as well as from traders who had arrangements with troops. But last year, the government closed many tunnels and limited trade.From September until the end of November, no commercial vehicles were permitted to enter the Eastern Ghouta at all,external, according to the Reach Initiative, which is in touch with people on the ground to gather humanitarian information. People reportedly go days without eating, consume non-edible plants, or reduce meal sizes Limited deliveries resumed in December, but the restrictions led to the exhaustion of food supplies and extremely inflated prices. Humanitarian organisations were prevented by the government from delivering aid in December and January, although one convoy carrying assistance for 7,200 people reached Nashabiya in mid-February. ""There are some dealers. They provide the Ghouta with flour, rice, sugar,"" said Mouayad. ""But even the dealers... are stopped right now from entering or exiting."" Today,a bundle of bread costs close to 22 times the national average,external, according to the UN. Malnutrition rates have reached unprecedented levels, with 11.9% of children under five years old acutely malnourished. The government has allowed one aid convoy into the Eastern Ghouta since late November Residents told Reach that they went days without eating, consumed non-edible plants, or reduced the size of their meals due to a lack of access to food. ""For my three-year-old son, I make bread. For my daughter, I search for a cow to bring milk,"" Mouayad said. ""I am an educated person. I can get money for my children. Other people, other families, cannot do that."" Even then, Mouayad explained that he had only enough money to pay for food for his own family for a few days more. He did not know what he would do after that. Asia does not have a job and cannot afford to buy much food when she is able to venture outside. Her father and brother are both dead. ""I receive money for my children from an organisation helping orphans, but unfortunately I do not have enough,"" she said. This video can not be played Young children have been found buried in the rubble Access to healthcare has also been severely limited by the siege and bombardment. Last month, a total of 29 primary healthcare facilities, hospitals, informal emergency care points and mobile clinics were still operating, Reach said. But since Sunday night, 14 medical facilities have been taken out of service as a result of government attacks, according to Dr Ahmad Dbis of the Union of Medical Care and Relief Organizations (UOSSM), which operates hospitals there. More than 10 medical staff and volunteers have also been killed and 20 injured. Dr Dbis said medics were being forced to sleep at the hospitals because it was too dangerous to leave. Ambulances were also unable to transport patients because they were being intentionally targeted by aircraft, he added. Doctors are having to treat wounded people with limited medical supplies and equipment He recalled how he had been in contact with his friend,UOSSM photographer Abdoulrahman Ismael,external, on Tuesday shortly before he was killed in an air strike. ""I heard the sound of bombs. I asked him 'what was that?' And he said there were barrel bombs 200m away. I asked him whether he was in a safe place. ""He said 'Yes, I am in a medical centre in Hamouria. I think it is safe.' Four minutes later, his internet connection went dead."" Dr Dbis said the situation was so bad in the Eastern Ghouta that doctors were only treating emergency cases. They also have to cope without key supplies, including anaesthetics, antibiotics, blood transfusion bags and clean bandages. Hundreds of critically sick and wounded patients are also in need of urgent medical evacuation for life-saving treatment. Twenty-nine were evacuated at the end of December, but the UN said another 22 died while awaiting permission to leave. A hospital in the town of Hamouria was bombed on Tuesday The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid Raad Al Hussein, has urged the international community to take concerted action to stop what he called a ""monstrous campaign of annihilation"". The government and its allies have denied attacking civilians and rejected calls for a ceasefire or humanitarian pause. They say they are trying to liberate the Eastern Ghouta from ""terrorists"" and stop mortar and rocket attacks on neighbouring government-controlled areas, which have reportedly killed 113 civilians since mid-November. That has left many fearing that there will be a bloody battle like that seen in East Aleppo in late 2016, when rebels and civilians were bombed into submission. ""I hope that we can leave the Eastern Ghouta because we cannot bear any more of this,"" said Asia. Mouayad said he tried to escape the siege five years ago but failed. ""Unfortunately, my situation is now between fire and knife. Fire from bombing and shelling here in Eastern Ghouta. And the knife - terrorism in Syria from al-Qaeda or IS. There is no safe exit."" ""I want peace for my country. I want to raise my children in a respectful way. I want them to live in peace in any possible way. I want safety for my children,"" he added.

Firms cut NRA ties amid Florida backlashSeveral corporate partners abandon the US gun lobby in the wake of the deadly school shooting.3h3 hours agoBusiness,"Activists are putting pressure on companies with ties to the NRA, a powerful gun lobby A growing number of companies have cut ties with the National Rifle Association amid calls for a boycott of businesses linked to the US gun lobby after the Florida school shooting. United and Delta airlines joined car rental giants Hertz and Enterprise in ending discounts for NRA members. The murder of 17 people has prompted renewed calls for tighter gun controls. Florida Republican Governor Rick Scott has backed calls to raise the minimum age for buying a gun from 18 to 21. Mr Scott has been widely seen as an ally of the NRA who has previously opposed stricter laws in the state. However, he has come under mounting pressure to respond to the demands of students who survived the shootings at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. Activists have tried to put pressure on the NRA since the shooting by targeting firms that offer discounts and other benefits to its members. They have flooded its corporate partners with comments on social media under the hashtag #BoycottNRA. Firms under pressure include delivery company FedEx and tech giants such as Amazon, which distributes NRA television programmes.

In Florida, the president of the Florida Education Association, which represents teachers' unions, also called on the state to look at pension holdings in gun companies ina statement to the Miami Herald newspaper,external. The NRA, which claims five million members, shot back at those corporations on Saturday, saying the moves punished the organisation's members in a ""shameful display of political and civic cowardice"". ""In time, these brands will be replaced by others who recognize that patriotism and determined commitment to Constitutional freedoms are characteristics of a marketplace they very much want to serve,""the NRA said,external. ""Let it be absolutely clear. The loss of a discount will neither scare nor distract one single NRA member from our mission to stand and defend the individual freedoms that have always made America the greatest nation in the world.""

Rick Scott said his aim was for Florida to ""require all individuals purchasing firearms to be 21 or older,"" adding that the he wanted to make it ""virtually impossible"" for anyone with mental health issues to acquire a gun. Mr Trump earlier said he supported the proposal to raise the age at which a person can buy a gun from 18, and said he believed the NRA would back such a proposal. ""I don't think I'll be going up against them,"" Mr Trump said of the gun lobby. ""They're good people."" In other developments: It has emerged that an unidentified woman called the FBI on 5 January to say she was worried that Nikolas Cruz, the suspected gunman, would get into a school, ""shooting the place up"".

The campaign comes as US businesses increasingly find themselves entangled in political debates, as activists target them on issues such as LGBTQ rights, as well as ties to the president. Companies such asretailer Nordstromand sportswear brand Under Armour are among the firms that have been subject to calls for boycotts from the left and right. Executives serving on presidential councils, including the formerchief executive of Uber, have resigned from the advisory groups after consumer pressure.The councils eventually disbanded last summer.

Ecuador says Assange talks at impasseThe country's foreign minister says Ecuador will keep looking for ways to end the Wikileaks founder's case.,"Ecuador says the country's latest efforts to negotiate the departure of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange from its London embassy have failed. Foreign minister Maria Fernanda Espinosa said the UK was unwilling to take part in talks about his release. A UK Foreign Office spokesman said Mr Assange should ""leave the embassy to face justice"". Mr Assange, 46, has been staying at the country's London embassy since 2012 where he was granted political asylum. Last week,the arrest warrant against him was upheldmeaning as soon as he leaves the embassy he will be detained. Ecuador's foreign minister said: ""On the issue of mediation, I have to say very honestly that it has not been successful because two parties are needed to mediate. Ecuador is willing, but not necessarily the other party"". She said her country would ""continue looking for mechanisms"" to end the stalemate. But a spokesman from the UK Foreign Office said: ""Ecuador knows that the way to resolve this issue is for Julian Assange to leave the embassy to face justice"" Last December, Mr Assange was granted Ecuadorean citizenship in a move which the country hoped could give him immunity in the UK. But the UK does not recognise Mr Assange as a diplomatic agent and continues to insist he should ""face justice"". There is no extradition treaty between the UK and Ecuador so he cannot be arrested inside the embassy. Campaigner or attention-seeker? Baywatch star's 'love' for Assange Mr Assange breached bail conditions when he sought refuge at the Ecuadorean embassy six years ago. He faced questioning oversexual assault allegations in Sweden, which have since been dropped. Previously, Mr Assange has justified his decision to break bail conditions arguing if he faced the Swedish authorities he would be extradited to the US over the publication of classified documents.

Red Cross staff paid for sexual servicesThe humanitarian aid agency reveals 21 staff have left for sexual misconduct since 2015.4h4 hours agoEurope,"The ICRC launched an internal review after reports of misconduct at aid agencies The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) says 21 members of staff have left their jobs for sexual misconduct in the last three years. The ICRC's director-general, Yves Daccord, said the individuals had paid for ""sexual services"" and had resigned or were dismissed from the aid agency. Mr Daccord said on Friday that it was ""a difficult but important day"". The revelations come as the aid sector has been hit by numerous allegations of sex abuse and exploitation by workers. Mr Daccord said that it was the recent reports of sexual misconduct from humanitarian agencies that had spurred the Geneva-based ICRC to conduct an internal review. Its code of conduct has explicitly forbidden the purchase of sexual services since 2006. Friday's statement follows reports that Plan International, a children's aid agency, confirmed six cases of sexual abuse and child exploitation by staff or associates. ""I have instructed my teams to scour the data we do have on sexual misconduct, and I can tell you that since 2015 we've identified 21 staff members who were either dismissed for paying for sexual services or resigned during an internal enquiry,"" Mr Daccord said. Plan International reveals child sex abuse cases How the Oxfam scandal unfolded Two other staff members who were suspected of sexual misconduct did not have their contracts renewed, Mr Daccord said, adding that he was ""deeply saddened to report these numbers"". He said that the ICRC, which has 17,000 members of staff worldwide, was concerned that incidents that should have been reported were not, or were not properly handled. ""This behaviour is a betrayal of the people and the communities we are there to serve,"" Mr Daccord said. ""It is against human dignity and we should have been more vigilant in preventing this."" The ICRC statement promises that all future allegations will be acted upon firmly and consistently, and that any employee found to have violated the ICRC's code of conduct will be held accountable. Ex-Save the Children boss resigns from Unicef Nine charts that show what aid agencies do International aid organisations have come under scrutiny sinceUK newspaper The Times reported earlier this month that Oxfam GB had covered up claims of sexual misconduct,externalby its staff in Haiti. On Friday, 22 aid organisations said they were ""truly sorry"" for the sector's failings in the wake of allegations of sexual misconduct by workers. In a letter signed by chief executives,agencies including Save the Children UK and Oxfam GB vowed to do more to protect those they were set up to help.

Homeless 'devastated' by doorway deathHomeless people are bracing themselves for an expected drop in temperatures.2h2 hours agoEssex,"Ross Miller had known Rob O'Connor since 2002 Homeless people have told of their shock after a man died in a shop doorway during a night of freezing temperatures. The body ofRob O'Connor was found in Springfield Road, Chelmsford on Friday morning. Essex Police said Mr O'Connor's death is being treated as unexplained. Although temperatures in the city dropped below 0C (32F) on the night of his death, his friends say he had been suffering with his health in general. Mr O'Connor, who was originally from Canada, is understood to have recently undergone an operation for cancer, which required the removal of his voice box. Ross Miller, who is homeless, said he had known Mr O'Connor for 16 years: ""I was devastated when I heard the news. He could be a pain, but he was all right. He was a nice bloke."" This message was put up by a homeless man in Chelmsford called Dave. Dave said he put up the board, which has since blown away, because he feared nobody else would recognise the death of a fellow rough sleeper He said the streets had been bitterly cold the past few days, adding: ""I wish I had somewhere to go. I don't like sitting here, I really don't. ""Some people are really kind, they give you the time of day, maybe a little food or some spare money."" Alice, who works at a coffee shop in Chelmsford, said: ""I knew the guy who died, he was around here quite a bit so you just do what you can. ""It is cold and hideous at the moment, so you have got to be nice when you can."" A coffee shop worker brought out warm drinks and cakes for homeless people, during a BBC interview A second homeless man, called Daniel, from Bradford, said some homeless people struggled to get places in night shelters. He said homeless people who tested positive for drink or drugs often found themselves turned away. ""We are not bad people,"" he said. ""We are functioning alcoholics - we drink just to keep warm. ""We are not going to start problems. I would go in there to get some sleep and to not get hypothermia.""

Ecuador says Assange talks at impasse,"Ecuador says the country's latest efforts to negotiate the departure of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange from its London embassy have failed. Foreign minister Maria Fernanda Espinosa said the UK was unwilling to take part in talks about his release. A UK Foreign Office spokesman said Mr Assange should ""leave the embassy to face justice"". Mr Assange, 46, has been staying at the country's London embassy since 2012 where he was granted political asylum. Last week,the arrest warrant against him was upheldmeaning as soon as he leaves the embassy he will be detained. Ecuador's foreign minister said: ""On the issue of mediation, I have to say very honestly that it has not been successful because two parties are needed to mediate. Ecuador is willing, but not necessarily the other party"". She said her country would ""continue looking for mechanisms"" to end the stalemate. But a spokesman from the UK Foreign Office said: ""Ecuador knows that the way to resolve this issue is for Julian Assange to leave the embassy to face justice"" Last December, Mr Assange was granted Ecuadorean citizenship in a move which the country hoped could give him immunity in the UK. But the UK does not recognise Mr Assange as a diplomatic agent and continues to insist he should ""face justice"". There is no extradition treaty between the UK and Ecuador so he cannot be arrested inside the embassy. Campaigner or attention-seeker? Baywatch star's 'love' for Assange Mr Assange breached bail conditions when he sought refuge at the Ecuadorean embassy six years ago. He faced questioning oversexual assault allegations in Sweden, which have since been dropped. Previously, Mr Assange has justified his decision to break bail conditions arguing if he faced the Swedish authorities he would be extradited to the US over the publication of classified documents.

Spring 'postponed' as big freeze hits UK,"Snowfall is expected across the UK on Monday and Tuesday Britain is set for the coldest February week in five years as freezing air arrives from Russia. On Saturday temperatures fell as low as -5.5C in Anglesey, north Wales and the cold spell is expected to intensify from Sunday night into Monday. The Met Office has issued an amber cold weather alert, which warns of increased health risks to vulnerable and elderly people. It has alsoissued two yellow weather warnings for snow,external. Snow showers are expected in large parts of the UK on Monday and Tuesday, which could cause travel delays and cancellations, power cuts and problems with mobile phone services. From the archive: The snow storm of 1982 Two rescued on Snowdon after being stuck in snow and ice Heaviest snowfall on record blankets Moscow BBC weatherforecaster Gemma Plumb said snow showers will arrive in the east of the UK on Sunday night before pushing through to western areas by Tuesday. Showers could continue later into the week. Two weather warnings have been issued for Monday and Tuesday The heavier showers are expected on Monday night and Tuesday, she added. Although there is a chance some areas could see between five and ten centimetres of snow, other areas may experience much lighter flurries. The Met Office alsoissued a separate amber cold weather alert,external- the second most serious - warning that icy conditions and snow could disrupt the delivery of services and increase health risks to vulnerable patients. The alert, issued for 09:00 on Friday until 08:00 on 1 March, warns the cold can be dangerous especially for the very young, very old or those with chronic diseases. The Met Office said temperatures are set to be 1C in most urban areas on Monday - although other parts will not reach 0C. The cold weather could last for one or even two weeks. Minimum temperatures next week are forecast for between -5C to -8C but it is expected to feel much colder. This video can not be played Why will the UK be so cold next week? BBC weather explains Met Office meteorologist Martin Bowles said: ""The feels-like temperature will be 5C lower than what we see on the thermometer because of a strong easterly wind chill."" The meteorological start of spring is Thursday, 1 March, when average temperatures are usually 10C in the south east and 9C in Manchester. But this year 1 March will fall right in the middle of the cold spell, which is being caused by an area of high pressure moving north into Scandinavia drawing cold air in from the east. Mr Bowles said: ""It's expected to stay cold all of next week. Spring will come eventually but it will be postponed. Some parts of Scotland have already seen heavy snow this month ""We haven't had temperatures that low in late February since 2013. It's not unheard of. There are records that are lower than that. ""But it is quite unusual, particularly as it's quite late in the season."" Public Health England said it is ""critical"" to keep an eye on anyone over 65, young children or people with heart or lung conditions. Dr Thomas Waite, of the PHE Extreme Events team, said:  ""Cold temperatures, indoors and out, pose real health risks to many and every winter we know that thousands of people get ill and even die following exposure to cold conditions. ""Staying warm by heating your home to at least 18C can be crucial to stay well."" Sadiq Khan, the Mayor of London, said on Friday that he had opened emergency homeless shelters ahead of the drop in temperature. You must enable JavaScript to view this content.

Ex-Trump aide 'paid European ex-politicians',"Mr Manafort insists he is innocent Donald Trump's former campaign manager Paul Manafort secretly paid former senior European politicians to lobby for Ukraine's previous pro-Russia government, a new indictment says. It alleges the group was led by a former European chancellor; ex-Austrian Chancellor Alfred Gusenbauer has denied to the BBC that it was him. The indictment has been brought as part of a US investigation into claims of Russia meddling in the US election. Mr Manafort denies all the charges. His former aide, and Mr Trump's ex-deputy campaign manager, Rick Gates, has admitted conspiracy and lying to investigators in a plea deal. There are no allegations that either Mr Manafort or Mr Gates colluded with Russia to influence the outcome of the 2016 presidential election, which is the main thrust of US special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation. Trump Russia affair: Key questions answered Who's who in Russia scandal? The Trump-Russia saga in 200 words Mr Manafort faces new charges of conspiracy, money-laundering, failing to register as an agent for a foreign actor and making false statements. The charges relate to his work for Ukraine's pro-Russian Party of Regions and its leader Viktor Yanukovych, who was president from 2010 until he was overthrown and fled to Russia following anti-government protests in 2014. Mr Manafort is said to have made tens of millions of dollars from an extensive lobbying campaign to bolster the Ukrainian government's reputation within Europe and the US. But, says the indictment, he failed to register his work as required by the law and hid the financial proceeds in off-shore accounts. The man who helped Trump win The indictment also details ways in which he allegedly tried to put distance between his lobbying work and its links with Mr Yanukovych. One of those attempts was the creation of a body of ex-European politicians, informally called the Hapsburg Group, to whom he paid over â¬2m ($2.5m; Â£1.8m), the indictment says. Mr Manafort has already been charged with multiple counts of tax and bank fraud. Mr Manafort ""secretly retained a group of former senior European politicians to take positions favorable to Ukraine, including by lobbying in the United States"", the indictment says. It does not name the members of the Hapsburg group, but says the body was managed by a former European chancellor it calls ""Foreign Politician A"" in co-ordination with Mr Manafort. The word chancellor is used in various government roles in Europe, but is the title for the head of government in Austria and Germany. There has been speculation the former chancellor referred to in the indictment is Alfred Gusenbauer who was Austria's chancellor from 2007-08. Mr Gusenbauer told the BBC that he had been part of ""noble"" efforts to bring Ukraine closer to the European Union, and admitted visiting members of the US Congress in 2013 about the issue. Former Austrian Chancellor Alfred Gusenbauer has been linked to the group He said he understood he was paid for his consultancy work by a US company - not by Mr Manafort, whom he met on two occasions, or Mr Yanukovych's government. ""I was not aware of the fact Mr Manafort was financing this activity and of course I was also not connected to his activities within the Ukraine,"" he said. ""I was not employed by Mr Yanukovych's government. I was, in the European, and American and general interest, working for an association agreement between Ukraine and Europe."" Former Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi has also been linked in media reports to the group. He told the BBC that he was part of a group of former European politicians who ""tried to understand if something could be done, but nothing could be done. So we've stopped."" There is no suggestion that any of the European politicians could face further consequences as a result of their involvement in this case. Nineteen people - including Mr Manafort and Mr Gates - have been indicted by the special counsel: Michael Flynn, a former US national security adviser, pleaded guilty to lying to the FBIover meetings he had with the Russian Ambassador, Sergei Kislyak George Papadopoulos, a former Trump campaign adviser, admitted lying to the FBIabout his contacts with Russians Last week,13 Russians were charged with tampering in the 2016 US electionand a California man, Richard Pinedo, admitted an identity theft charge This week London-based lawyerAlex van der Zwaan pleaded guilty in court to making false statementswhen questioned about his work for Ukraine's justice ministry Mr Trump has said there was no collusion.

Russian athlete banned from Games,"Nadezhda Sergeeva (right) had returned a clean result in a doping test on 13 February, the Russian Bobsleigh Federation said Russian bobsleigh pilot Nadezhda Sergeeva has been banned from the Winter Olympics for doping - just a day before Olympic chiefs meet to discuss lifting sanctions on her country. The International Olympic Committee banned Russia over ""systemic"" doping at Sochi 2014, which the country hosted. However, 168 athletes who proved they were clean were allowed to compete as neutrals at the Pyeongchang Games. Sergeeva is the second of those 168 to have failed a doping test. The IOC's executive board met on Saturday, when a discussion on whether to maintain or lift the suspension on Russia took place - a decision is now expected on Sunday. Lifting the suspension would allow Russian athletes to parade with their national flag at Sunday's closing ceremony. Russian doping whistleblower Grigory Rodchenkov's flag warning However some feel that is now unlikely to happen, with Russian athletes producing two of the four failed doping tests in Pyeongchang. ""They were due to look at how we behaved here and decide, but as we've got two doping cases I don't think they will allow us to be at the closing with the flag,"" alpine skier Anastasia Silanteva told Reuters. ""Especially in light of the second doping offence, our position is that the flag should not come into the closing ceremony with the Russian team,"" Canadian Olympic Committee president Tricia Smith said. The neutral Olympic athletes from Russia (OAR) teamwon their first gold medal of the Games in South Koreaon Friday. That followed Russian curlerAlexander Krushelnitsky being stripped of his bronzemedal after being found guilty of doping. The OAR team are the third biggest at the Games, behind Canada and the United States. Sergeeva, 30, finished 12th in the two-woman bobsleigh event. A Court of Arbitration for Sport panel met on Saturday to hear her case following her failed test. ""The athlete has accepted a provisional suspension beyond the period of the Games,"" it said, adding that Sergeeva had admitted an anti-doping rule violation after testing positive for trimetazidine. Trimetazidine is used to treat heart conditions but is also classed as a metabolic modulator by the World Anti-Doping Agency because it has performance-enhancing properties. The Russian Bobsleigh Federation hadearlier said Sergeeva had tested positivefor ""a heart drug"" that ""was not prescribed"" by its medical team. It added that a test on 18 February came back positive but a previous one on 13 February had showed a clean result. ""She doesn't understand where she made a mistake,"" said Russian bobsleigh official Sergei Zhurkin. Meanwhile, members of the US biathlon team have announced that they will not take part in next month's World Cup final - because it is being staged in Russia. The International Biathlon Union (IBU) event is taking place in Tyumen, from 19-26 March and the US team said it was ""completely unacceptable"" to allow that nation to host the event as it sent ""an outrageous message of anti-doping indifference to the world"". ""We fully support the right of clean Russian athletes to compete, and share the opinion that Russia should be eligible to host IBU World Cups in the future, but only after they have shown a meaningful commitment to rectifying the doping culture which has been shown to exist there,"" a US team statement added.

Manafort 'paid European ex-politicians',"Mr Manafort insists he is innocent Donald Trump's former campaign manager Paul Manafort secretly paid former senior European politicians to lobby for Ukraine's previous pro-Russia government, a new indictment says. It alleges the group was led by a former European chancellor; ex-Austrian Chancellor Alfred Gusenbauer has denied to the BBC that it was him. The indictment has been brought as part of a US investigation into claims of Russia meddling in the US election. Mr Manafort denies all the charges. His former aide, and Mr Trump's ex-deputy campaign manager, Rick Gates, has admitted conspiracy and lying to investigators in a plea deal. There are no allegations that either Mr Manafort or Mr Gates colluded with Russia to influence the outcome of the 2016 presidential election, which is the main thrust of US special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation. Trump Russia affair: Key questions answered Who's who in Russia scandal? The Trump-Russia saga in 200 words Mr Manafort faces new charges of conspiracy, money-laundering, failing to register as an agent for a foreign actor and making false statements. The charges relate to his work for Ukraine's pro-Russian Party of Regions and its leader Viktor Yanukovych, who was president from 2010 until he was overthrown and fled to Russia following anti-government protests in 2014. Mr Manafort is said to have made tens of millions of dollars from an extensive lobbying campaign to bolster the Ukrainian government's reputation within Europe and the US. But, says the indictment, he failed to register his work as required by the law and hid the financial proceeds in off-shore accounts. The man who helped Trump win The indictment also details ways in which he allegedly tried to put distance between his lobbying work and its links with Mr Yanukovych. One of those attempts was the creation of a body of ex-European politicians, informally called the Hapsburg Group, to whom he paid over â¬2m ($2.5m; Â£1.8m), the indictment says. Mr Manafort has already been charged with multiple counts of tax and bank fraud. Mr Manafort ""secretly retained a group of former senior European politicians to take positions favorable to Ukraine, including by lobbying in the United States"", the indictment says. It does not name the members of the Hapsburg group, but says the body was managed by a former European chancellor it calls ""Foreign Politician A"" in co-ordination with Mr Manafort. The word chancellor is used in various government roles in Europe, but is the title for the head of government in Austria and Germany. There has been speculation the former chancellor referred to in the indictment is Alfred Gusenbauer who was Austria's chancellor from 2007-08. Mr Gusenbauer told the BBC that he had been part of ""noble"" efforts to bring Ukraine closer to the European Union, and admitted visiting members of the US Congress in 2013 about the issue. Former Austrian Chancellor Alfred Gusenbauer has been linked to the group He said he understood he was paid for his consultancy work by a US company - not by Mr Manafort, whom he met on two occasions, or Mr Yanukovych's government. ""I was not aware of the fact Mr Manafort was financing this activity and of course I was also not connected to his activities within the Ukraine,"" he said. ""I was not employed by Mr Yanukovych's government. I was, in the European, and American and general interest, working for an association agreement between Ukraine and Europe."" Former Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi has also been linked in media reports to the group. He told the BBC that he was part of a group of former European politicians who ""tried to understand if something could be done, but nothing could be done. So we've stopped."" There is no suggestion that any of the European politicians could face further consequences as a result of their involvement in this case. Nineteen people - including Mr Manafort and Mr Gates - have been indicted by the special counsel: Michael Flynn, a former US national security adviser, pleaded guilty to lying to the FBIover meetings he had with the Russian Ambassador, Sergei Kislyak George Papadopoulos, a former Trump campaign adviser, admitted lying to the FBIabout his contacts with Russians Last week,13 Russians were charged with tampering in the 2016 US electionand a California man, Richard Pinedo, admitted an identity theft charge This week London-based lawyerAlex van der Zwaan pleaded guilty in court to making false statementswhen questioned about his work for Ukraine's justice ministry Mr Trump has said there was no collusion.

Arrest in Kuwait frozen maid case,"Ms Demafelis's sister cried over her casket upon its arrival in Manila last week The employers of a Filipina maid found dead in a freezer in Kuwait have been arrested in the Syrian capital Damascus after a manhunt lasting several weeks. Joanna Demafelis, 29, was found frozen in her employers' apartment more than a year after she was reported missing. Both Nader Essam Assaf and his Syrian wife Mona are being held on suspicion of murder, officials said on Saturday. Mr Assaf, who is a Lebanese national, was transferred to Beirut but his wife remains in custody in Damascus. On Saturday, a Lebanese judicial official said the couple had left Kuwait and made a ""very brief stopover"" in Lebanon before travelling on the neighbouring Syria. ""Lebanon has asked Kuwait to pass on [Mr Assaf's] police record,"" the official added. Ms Demafelis's death prompted outrage in the Philippines and a ban on Filipinos travelling to work in Kuwait. Both suspects became the subject of an international manhunt aided by Interpol. Philippines foreign secretary Alan Peter Cayetano welcomed the news of the arrests, calling it a ""critical first step in our quest for justice for Joanna"". Philippines stops workers going to Kuwait Singaporeans jailed for starving maid The country training people to leave The maid's body was found this month with apparent signs of torture, Philippine officials said, in an apartment that had apparently been abandoned for at least a year. In the aftermath of the discovery, Philippine authorities say they facilitated the return of more than 1,000 ""distressed overseas Filipino workers"" in Kuwait, most of whom had worked as household servants. The country's department of foreign affairs estimate that some 252,000 of its citizens are living and working there. Kuwaiti authorities, meanwhile, have vowed to do everything possible to see justice is done. Mr Cayetano said he expected Kuwaiti authorities to request the extradition of Mr Assaf from Lebanon, to stand trial in Kuwait.

Pub's discount for diners ditching phones,"General manager Mark Finley and restaurant manageress Jade Darlington hope to see less of this in their pub Ever been out for a meal with someone who spent more time staring at their phone than looking at you? One Wrexham pub has started running an offer to help make this a thing of the past and encourage people to talk without any distractions. Customers at The Fat Boar will get 25% off food bills for giving up their phones as part of its ""Mobile Free Monday"". The phones will be locked in cash boxes on tables and staff hold the keys. Rich Watkin, the Fat Boar's director, said: ""Mobiles can often be a real distraction and stop us from just sitting among family and friends and simply having a good conversation and that's why I came up with the idea."" If successful, the scheme will be rolled out at the pub's sister restaurant on Chester Street, Mold. Restaurant manageress Jade Darlington added: ""I think we all feel a certain amount of pressure to be constantly checking emails, social media, texts and all the other messaging on our phones. ""But if we can do something to encourage people to put their phones down and concentrate solely on one another and the fun night out they are having with us, then I think that's a really positive thing.""

UK charity reveals child abuse cases,"The first allegations of abuse in the aid sector were from Haiti A children's aid charity has confirmed six cases of sexual abuse and child exploitation by staff or associates. Plan International said five of the cases, which took place between 1 July 2016 and 30 June 2017, were reported to authorities in the countries involved. On Friday it pledged - alongside 21 other organisations - to do more to protect those they were set up to help. Plan International said it was ""truly sorry"", adding that the cases had not involved British staff. The child rights organisation provides aid to more than 50 countries with the aim of improving access to food, water, shelter and education. It also works to end child marriages and female genital mutilation. In a blog post, Plan International UK says thatin the same 12-month period over 2016/2017 there were also nine incidents of sexual harassment or sexual misconduct,externalby staff on other adults. The disclosure comes as the aid sector has been hit by allegations of sex abuse and exploitation by workers. Plan International UK is among the charities - including Save the Children UK and Oxfam GB - to have signed a letter pledging a series of ""urgent and immediate"" measures, including more resources for safeguarding. ""There can be no tolerance for the abuse of power,"" the letter says. Nine charts that show what charities do How much UK charity money goes to Oxfam?

The promised measures include a review of referencing systems ""so that people found to have abused their power or behaved inappropriately are not re-employed in the sector"". Charities have been under scrutinysince the Times reported earlier this month that Oxfam GB had covered up claims of sexual misconduct,externalby its staff in Haiti. Haiti has suspended Oxfam GB operations in the country as it investigates the allegations from the aftermath of the 2010 earthquake. Vicky Browning, head of the Association of Chief Executives of Voluntary Organisations, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that said, while the charity sector could not guarantee ""zero incidents"", they could guarantee ""zero tolerance"". She said: ""Within the charity sector, some people have been concerned that if they report this kind of behaviour, it will harm the work that they so passionately believe inâ¦ [and] loss of public trust is hugely damaging for charities.

ICRC says staff paid for sexual services,"The ICRC launched an internal review after reports of misconduct at aid agencies The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) says 21 members of staff have left their jobs for sexual misconduct in the last three years. The ICRC's director-general, Yves Daccord, said the individuals had paid for ""sexual services"" and had resigned or were dismissed from the aid agency. Mr Daccord said on Friday that it was ""a difficult but important day"". The revelations come as the aid sector has been hit by numerous allegations of sex abuse and exploitation by workers. Mr Daccord said that it was the recent reports of sexual misconduct from humanitarian agencies that had spurred the Geneva-based ICRC to conduct an internal review. Its code of conduct has explicitly forbidden the purchase of sexual services since 2006. Friday's statement follows reports that Plan International, a children's aid agency, confirmed six cases of sexual abuse and child exploitation by staff or associates. ""I have instructed my teams to scour the data we do have on sexual misconduct, and I can tell you that since 2015 we've identified 21 staff members who were either dismissed for paying for sexual services or resigned during an internal enquiry,"" Mr Daccord said. Plan International reveals child sex abuse cases How the Oxfam scandal unfolded Two other staff members who were suspected of sexual misconduct did not have their contracts renewed, Mr Daccord said, adding that he was ""deeply saddened to report these numbers"". He said that the ICRC, which has 17,000 members of staff worldwide, was concerned that incidents that should have been reported were not, or were not properly handled. ""This behaviour is a betrayal of the people and the communities we are there to serve,"" Mr Daccord said. ""It is against human dignity and we should have been more vigilant in preventing this."" The ICRC statement promises that all future allegations will be acted upon firmly and consistently, and that any employee found to have violated the ICRC's code of conduct will be held accountable.

The country's leader said surveillance aircraft and more troops were being sent to help with the search. Anger has been growing among parents about the government's handling of the incident, which has revived memories of the Chibok schoolgirl abduction four years ago. Dapchi, about 275km (170 miles) north-west of Chibok, came under attack on Monday, causing students and teachers to flee into the surrounding bush. Why January is Boko Haram's deadliest month Who are Nigeria's Boko Haram Islamist group? Residents say that Nigeria's security forces, backed by military jets, later repelled the attack. Authorities initially denied the students had been kidnapped, saying they were hiding from their attackers. The Nigerian president apologised for the attack on Friday, in his first extended comments about the incident. ""We are sorry that this could have happened. We pray that our gallant armed forces will locate and safely return your missing family members,"" he said in a statement. The Yobe state government had to apologise after mistakenly issuing a statement on Wednesday that said some of the girls had been saved by the army. The Nigerian activist group, Bring Back Our Girls, has been lobbying the government to release a list of names in order to clarify how many pupils are missing. The secret diaries of the Chibok girls What we know about Chibok kidnappings The group was established after the abduction almost four years ago of 276 girls from a school in Chibok. The location of more than 100 of those girls is still unknown. Residents of Dapchi told the AFP news agency that soldiers had been deployed in the town, but had left last month. Nigeria's defence spokesman denied that any troops had been withdrawn. Boko Haram militants have been fighting a long insurgency in the country's north in their quest for an Islamic state in the region. The conflict is estimated to have killed tens of thousands of people, and led to the abduction of thousands. Kidnapped Chibok girl rescued in Nigeria Who are Boko Haram?

Euromillions: UK ticket holder wins Â£78m,"A UK ticket holder has won almost Â£78m after matching all seven numbers in Friday night's Euromillions draw. The lucky entrant was one of just two that matched all the numbers and has come forward to claim a half-share of the almost Â£156m rollover jackpot.

Tusk: UK Brexit plans 'pure illusion'The European Council president says reports suggest the UK is still trying to cherry pick its Brexit deal.,"This video can not be played EC President Donald Tusk rejected any idea of the UK being able to join a ""single market a la carte"" The UK's approach to the next stage of Brexit negotiations seems to be based on ""pure illusion"", Donald Tusk says. The European Council president told a news conference in Brussels that the UK was still trying to ""cherry pick"" its future relationship with the EU. Mr Tusk said he could only go on media reports of Brexit talks at the PM's country retreat Chequers on Thursday. Theresa May is set to deliver a key speech setting out British ambitions on Friday of next week. EU leaders split on spending after Brexit Laura Kuenssberg - a happy ending? The customs union explained in 45 seconds Labour's policy 'evolves' on customs union Mr Tusk, who is due to meet the PM the day before, said media reports suggested that the ""cake philosophy is still alive"" in the UK. He added: ""If the media reports are correct I am afraid that the UK position today is based on pure illusion."" He went on to reject - as he has done before - any notion of the UK ""cherry picking"" aspects of its future relationship with the EU or being able to join a ""single market a la carte"". The BBC understands that the 11 seniorministers at Chequers made a breakthrough on so-called ""managed divergence"", where the UK could select EU rules to stick to post-Brexit. Allow Twitter content?

Mr Tusk said the EU would continue to be ""extremely realistic"" during the forthcoming negotiations. The second phase of Brexit negotiations will cover transitional arrangements after the UK leaves and economic and security co-operation in the future. Mr Tusk, who spoke at an informal meeting of 27 European heads of states and governments, said he would present draft guidelines on the future EU-UK relationship at a summit in March. ""Our intention is to adopt these guidelines, whether the UK is ready with its vision of our future relations, or not,"" he said. ""Naturally it would be much better if it were. But we cannot stand by and wait."" He said he hoped to have more clarity when he meets the PM in London next week. The leaders also spoke about the EU's post-2020 budget, the composition of the European Parliament, Turkey and Syria. The cabinet's Brexit sub-committee discussed the government's approach for eight hours at Chequers on Thursday The government is set to pursue a policy which puts the UK outside a customs union with the EU - but matching EU rules in some industries in an attempt to achieve ""frictionless trade"". Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, who did not attend the meeting of senior ministers, said despite ""divergent views"" there was a ""central common understanding"". He said some sectors could align regulations with European regulations, adding: ""But it will be on a voluntary basis, we will as a sovereign power have the right to choose to diverge.""

Crucial UN Syria truce vote delayed,"This video can not be played ""At least in heaven there's food"": The children caught up in Eastern Ghouta air strikes The UN Security Council is struggling to agree a resolution seeking a ceasefire in Syria and has put back a vote until Saturday. The vote has already been delayed several times since Thursday. Russia wanted changes to a draft that calls for a 30-day calm to allow for aid deliveries and medical evacuations. Western diplomats have accused Russia, Syria's key ally, of stalling for time. France said failure to act may spell the end of the UN itself. Minds have been focused amid outrage at the plight of civilians in the Eastern Ghouta rebel enclave. Activists say 462 people have now been killed there this week. Warplanes maintained the bombardment on Friday, witnesses said. Douma and Hamouriyeh were among areas hit. Western powers suspect that Moscow wants to give Syria time to deal a final blow to forces defending the rebel-held enclave on the edge of Damascus. The United States, the UK and France had called for the resolution to be approved without delay. UN special envoy Staffan de Mistura said a truce had to be followed by immediate, unhindered access to the Eastern Ghouta. Commenting on Friday evening, US President Donald Trump pointed the finger of blame firmly at Syria and its allies, Russia and Iran, for the humanitarian crisis. ""What those three countries have done to people over the last, short period of time is a disgrace,"" he said, speaking alongside the visiting Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull in Washington. The draft, put forward by Kuwait and Sweden, calls for a nationwide truce to go into effect 72 hours after the resolution is passed. Medical evacuations and aid deliveries would start 48 hours after that. The draft says 5.6 million people in 1,244 communities across the country are in acute need. Life in Eastern Ghouta - read residents' stories Syria conflict: Will powers end up in direct war? Why is there a war in Syria? Sweden's UN ambassador Olof Skoog told the BBC that getting aid to the Eastern Ghouta, where conditions were described by the UN secretary general as ""hell on earth"", was the main objective. ""I think that without the pressure coming from a united Security Council things are not happening the way they should on the ground,"" he said. ""So I think for the council it's a little bit less about the details and more about giving a political pressure to ensure that this happens."" Already overwhelmed hospitals are struggling to cope with the influx of casualties France's UN ambassador FranÃ§ois Delattre said the UN's inability to help Syrian civilians would result in a devastating loss of credibility. ""The Syrian tragedy must not also become a graveyard for the United Nations,"" he added. The draft resolution also calls for all parties to avoid establishing military positions in civilian areas, including schools and hospitals. Sieges of populated areas should be lifted. French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel wrote a joint letter to Russian President Vladimir Putin, urging him to back the resolution. Under the terms of the draft resolution, any ceasefire would not apply to the Islamic State group, or the Nusra Front - formerly al-Qaeda's official affiliate in Syria. But Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov says it must go further and exclude other groups ""co-operating with them"" and which have shelled Damascus. This could include the two biggest rebel groups in Eastern Ghouta - Jaish al-Islam and its rival Faylaq al-Rahman. Faylaq al-Rahman has in the past fought alongside the jihadist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, an alliance of factions led by the Nusra Front. Mr Lavrov told reporters his country would be prepared to vote for the ceasefire under certain conditions. ""There are no guarantees that [the rebels] will not continue shooting at Damascus residential areas,"" he told a briefing. He said Russia had proposed ""a formula which would make the ceasefire real"". The Su-57, Russia's most advanced fighter plane, has been sent to Syria Meanwhile, two of Russia's most advanced fighter planes, Su-57s, have been sent to its coastal Hmeimim airbase, Russian military sources told BBC Russian. The sources said the stealth fighter planes were still undergoing flight tests and there was no confirmation they had yet been used in combat. For the sixth day running, Syrian government forces have pounded the Eastern Ghouta. A witness in Douma speaking to Reuters news agency early on Friday said the bombing there was the most intense so far. Syrian state TV says rebels have shelled Damascus, killing one and injuring dozens more. The US has also accused Russia of attacking Ghouta,external, allegations that Russian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov dismissed as ""groundless"". The number killed since Sunday in the Eastern Ghouta has risen to 462, the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group says, at least 99 of them children. Barrel bombs and shell fire have rained down on the area, where some 393,000 people remain trapped. This video can not be played Eastern Ghouta resident: ""Missiles are dropping like rain"" Rescue workers said the town of Douma came under sustained attack on Thursday The Syrian government has denied targeting civilians and insisted it is trying to liberate the Eastern Ghouta from ""terrorists"" - a term it has used to describe both jihadist militants and the mainstream rebel groups that dominate the enclave.

UK charity reveals child sex abuse,"The first allegations of abuse in the aid sector were from Haiti A children's aid charity has confirmed six cases of sexual abuse and child exploitation by staff or associates. Plan International said five of the cases, which took place between 1 July 2016 and 30 June 2017, were reported to authorities in the countries involved. On Friday it pledged - alongside 21 other organisations - to do more to protect those they were set up to help. Plan International said it was ""truly sorry"", adding that the cases had not involved British staff. The child rights organisation provides aid to more than 50 countries with the aim of improving access to food, water, shelter and education. It also works to end child marriages and female genital mutilation. In a blog post, Plan International UK says thatin the same 12-month period over 2016/2017 there were also nine incidents of sexual harassment or sexual misconduct,externalby staff on other adults. The disclosure comes as the aid sector has been hit by allegations of sex abuse and exploitation by workers. Plan International UK is among the charities - including Save the Children UK and Oxfam GB - to have signed a letter pledging a series of ""urgent and immediate"" measures, including more resources for safeguarding. ""There can be no tolerance for the abuse of power,"" the letter says. Nine charts that show what charities do How much UK charity money goes to Oxfam?

Charities have been under scrutinysince the Times reported earlier this month that Oxfam GB had covered up claims of sexual misconduct,externalby its staff in Haiti. Haiti has suspended Oxfam GB operations in the country as it investigates the allegations from the aftermath of the 2010 earthquake. Vicky Browning, head of the Association of Chief Executives of Voluntary Organisations, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that said, while the charity sector could not guarantee ""zero incidents"", they could guarantee ""zero tolerance"". She said: ""Within the charity sector, some people have been concerned that if they report this kind of behaviour, it will harm the work that they so passionately believe inâ¦ [and] loss of public trust is hugely damaging for charities.

"One French woman in eight raped - reportFour million women have been raped once in their lives, a major survey of abuse in France suggests.14h14 hours agoEurope","The Weinstein case in the US has inspired many French women to speak out on sexual abuse About four million French women - 12% of the total - have been raped at least once in their lives, a survey suggests. The study for the Fondation Jean JaurÃ¨s, a Paris-based think tank, also says 43% have been subjected to sexual touching without their consent. Like many other countries, France has seen women take to social media to highlight abuse in recent months. Many have shared their experiences under the hashtag ""Balance ton porc"" (""rat on your pig""). The campaign was launched following the rape allegations against Hollywood movie mogul Harvey Weinstein last October. Deneuve apologises to sex assault victims France's celebrity pushback against 'MeToo' France plans law on street harassment The aim of the survey (in French) of 2,000 women published on Friday was to assess the extent of sexual sexual harassment,externaland violence in France. In addition to the 12% who say they have been raped, 58% have been subjected to disturbing propositions and 43% to ""sexual touching without consent"", the study says. Most of the women reporting such abuse have experienced it several times, it adds. The report highlights the ""heavy consequences and long-term repercussions suffered by the victims"". But the ""rat on your pig"" movement has generated national debate around what constitutes harassment. Last month French movie star Catherine Deneuve was one of 100 women who signed an open letter claiming the movement had gone too far. It warned of a new type of ""Puritanism"" and insisted men should be ""free to pester women"". ""Rape is a crime, but trying to seduce someone, even persistently or clumsily, is not - and nor is men being gentlemanly a chauvinist attack."" Gender equality minister Marlene Schiappa wants to outlaw harassment Deneuve later clarified her position saying the letter was not meant as a defence of harassment and ""fraternally"" paid tribute to victims of sexual assault. The French minister for gender equality, MarlÃ¨ne Schiappa, has vocally defended ""balance ton porc"", ""Me Too"" and similar movements. Last year Ms Schiappa set out plans for a law cracking down on sexual violence and harassment. The proposals would include on-the-spot fines for catcalling and lecherous behaviour in public. As well as cracking down on harassment, the legislation will also give people who experienced sexual assault as a child more time to make a police complaint, and toughen laws on sex with minors.

EU debates budget deal,"Mr Macron and Mrs Merkel say any cuts to EU programmes could be damaging EU leaders have agreed to spend more on common defence and security policy in their next long-term budget, European Council President Donald Tusk says. Leaders of 27 states were meeting in Brussels to shape the 2021-27 budget. Members have been in disagreement on how to compensate for funding loss after Britain's planned 2019 departure. Germany and France have warned any funding cuts to EU programmes could damage efforts to tackle illegal immigration and terrorism. Speaking after the meeting, Mr Tusk said leaders had agreed to spend more on security, as well as fighting illegal migration in their next long-term budget. He said many of the EU leaders were ready to contribute more to the pot, but acknowledged others were less forthcoming. Deciding how to fill the budgetary hole that Brexit will leave is problematic, says the BBC's Kevin Connolly, as net contributors such as Austria and the Netherlands take a sharply different view from net beneficiaries such as Poland and Greece. The summit is focusing on the future leadership and budget of EU institutions While wealthier Northern countries make the case for a reduced budget, poorer member states in eastern and southern Europe are unhappy about the possibility of cuts to programme funding. The clash of the euro visions EU shadow-boxing towards Brexit Member states to sue over refugees Ahead of Friday's talks, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker had said he was concerned about a ""rift between east and west"". ""Sometimes it gets wider and sometimes differences are bridged. I don't want any new divisions in Europe. We've had enough of those."" By Kevin Connolly, BBC News, Brussels EU budget problems are not fixed in a single afternoon of talks - agreeing how much the organisation should collect from member states after Brexit will take months. There's a clear division between the rich countries, who don't want to fix the post-Brexit shortfall by paying more, and the poor countries, who don't want to bridge it by taking less. And all the while, like the rumble of gunfire from a neighbouring battlefield, the Brexit issue hangs in the air here. Plenty of European leaders have said that progress can't be made until they have more clarity and certainty from the British side. Separately, it was also announced that the UK Prime Minister Theresa May is to deliver long-awaited speech setting out her vision for the UK's future relationship with the EU on 2 March. Speaking on Friday, Mr Tusk said EU leaders planned to push ahead with the release of their own joint stance for future relations in March, whether Britain is ready or not.

Outrage at mass shooting claim,"Congresswoman Tenney (far left) attends a presidential bill signing A Republican US lawmaker from New York is facing political backlash after she claimed in a radio interview that many mass shooters tend to be Democrats. Democrats immediately condemned Claudia Tenney's remarks, which came a week after a school shooting left 17 people dead in Florida. She had been responding to a question about crime in the inner cities. A spokesman for the Democrats called her an ""embarrassment"" and her comments ""unhinged, shameful and disgusting"". Ms Tenney said in a statement on Wednesday night that she was ""fed up with the media and liberals attempting to politicise tragedies and demonise law-abiding gun owners and conservative Americans every time there is a horrible tragedy"". ""While we know the perpetrators of these atrocities have a wide variety of political views, my comments are in response to a question about the failure to prosecute illegal gun crime,"" she added. America's gun culture in 10 charts ""I will continue to stand up for law-abiding citizens who are smeared by anti-gun liberal elitists."" In her interview with Albany radio station WGDJ, Ms Tenney said that she feared that ""legal gun owners are going to be targeted"" by new gun laws being proposed. Ms Tenney is an advocate for gun rights ""It's interesting that so many of these people that commit the mass murders end up being Democrats,"" Ms Tenney said. The interviewer claimed that most gun crimes occur ""in what's euphemistically called the inner cities involving minorities, and they're the ones that Democrats generally are going to bend over backwards to protect"". ""Obviously there's a lot of politics in it,"" Ms Tenney said in response. She added that gun owners ""have the least amount of crimes than virtually any other demographic"". Her presumptive challenger in the mid-term election, Anthony Brindisi, said in a Twitter post that her ""toxic rhetoric"" was ""a new low"". Allow Twitter content?

Would Australia's gun laws help?,"A service in 2016 to mark the 20th anniversary of Australia's Port Arthur massacre ""We have an opportunity in this country not to go down the American path."" Those were the words of former Australian Prime Minister John Howard before he radically changed Australia's gun laws and - many believe - rid the country of gun violence on a large scale. Now the US is reeling from another mass shooting - its deadliest ever - in Las Vegas. A year after 49 people were shot dead in an Orlando nightclub, America continues to find itself far down that violent path. But could it still change course the way Australia did? In April 1996, 35 people were killed by a gunman, Martin Bryant, wielding semi-automatic weapons at a former prison colony and tourist attraction in Tasmania. This became known as the Port Arthur massacre, and it was a turning point for Australia. Many Port Arthur victims died in a cafe which is now part of the site's memorial The event appalled and galvanised the nation, helping to push Australia to enact some of themost comprehensive firearm laws in the world.,external Former US President Barack Obama often pointed to Australia as an example for the US to follow. ""When Australia had a mass killing - I think it was in Tasmania - about 25 years ago, it was just so shocking the entire country said: 'Well, we're going to completely change our gun laws'. And they did, and it hasn't happened since,"" he said in 2015. So what exactly did Australia do, how did it work, and could it work in the US? Less than two weeks after the Port Arthur massacre, all six Australian states agreed to enact the same sweeping gun laws banning semi-automatic rifles and shotguns - weapons that can kill many people quickly. They also put more hurdles between prospective gun owners and their weapons. Australia has 28-day waiting periods, thorough background checks, and a requirement to present a ""justifiable reason"" to own a gun. Unlike in the US, self-protection is not accepted as a justifiable reason to own a gun. In the 21 years since the laws were passed, about one million semi-automatic weapons - roughly one third of the country's firearms - were sold back to the government and destroyed, nearly halving the number of gun-owning households in Australia. The number of Australia's mass shootings dropped from 11 in the decade before 1996, to one in the years since - the murder-suicide of a family of five in New South Wales in 2014. Unregistered weapons surrendered during Australia's 2017 gun amnesty Although the laws were designed specifically to reduce mass shootings, the rates of homicide and suicide have also come down since 1996. Philip Alpers, a professor at Sydney School of Public Health,has done studies,externalshowing that aside from the victims of the Port Arthur shooting, 69 gun homicides were recorded in 1996 compared with 30 in 2012. Despite the reduction in incidence though, gun violence has not disappeared in Australia. Many outlawed firearms have been replaced with legal ones. And nearly 26,000 unregistered guns have beenhanded backthis year in the first national amnesty since the Port Arthur killings. Australia 1996: Approximately 17.5 guns per 100 people 2016 (most recent numbers available): About 13.7 guns per 100 people United States 1996: Approximately 91 guns per 100 people 2009 (most recent numbers available): Approximately 101 guns per 100 people Sources: AIC Australian institute of Criminology,Gun Policy,,externalSmall Arms Survey,,externalandUS Dept of Justice Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives,external Australian firearms rights groups say that the laws go too far and restrict personal freedom. They argue that gun violence was on a downward trajectory before the 1996 laws were passed, and reject any link between lower incidence of gun deaths and the tighter legislation. Diana Melham, executive director of the Sporting Shooters Australia Association in New South Wales, argues the 1996 laws fuelled a sense of alienation among gun owners, which, she says ""rallied the shooters"". The organisation, which is the country's largest gun lobby group, has grown rapidly since 1996 and its numbers are still on the rise. Diana Melham says 1996 tightened gun ownership laws alienated gun owners But Tim Fischer, who was Prime Minister Howard's deputy in 1996 and instrumental in getting the National Firearms Agreement passed, argues the US should follow Australia's lead. ""Plain and simple, what we've done works,"" he told the BBC in 2015. So could it work in the US? The simple answer is - probably not. Although Australia does have a long history of hunting and sport, there is no equivalent to America's Second Amendment right to bear arms here. Another significant difference is the speed of government action. In 1996 John Howard managed to get all six Australian states to agree to and pass uniform sweeping gun control legislation in just 12 days. It is hard to fathom the US government ever being able to get all 50 states to agree to something, let alone act that quickly. The massacre was said to have been the ""straw that broke the camel's back"" But according to Prof Alpers, the bigger difference is the cultural mindset. ""I don't for a moment think it would happen in the US,"" he says. ""Australia already had a pre-disposition to doing something about it."" He explains that although by far the deadliest, the Port Arthur shooting was not the first Australia had experienced. He says the country had lost nearly 150 people in the years running up to 1996 in mass shootings, and the national mood was changing. ""Port Arthur was the straw that broke the camel's back. You have to go back to those years to remember how visceral that backlash was."" Mr Fischer is more optimistic. He believes meaningful change could come to the US, but only when a ""silent majority"" are ""sprung into action"". ""Of course all mass shootings are a bridge too far,"" he says. ""But there is going to be one that really tips the balance. Watch this space."" Exact numbers of the incidence of mass shootings in the US and abroad are hard to pin down because there is no uniform standard on the definition of a mass shooting. In the US, there is no official database for this type of information, but tallies like the one from private research group ShootingTracker.com who put the number of mass shootings in the US in 2016 at 383, have been widely cited in the US media in the wake of other mass shootings.

Nigeria mass girl kidnaps a 'disaster',"Parents have expressed their anger over the government's handling of the attack Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari has called the suspected kidnapping of dozens of schoolgirls by Boko Haram militants a ""national disaster"". Jihadists stormed the school in the town of Dapchi in the north east on Monday but it is unclear how many girls are missing. Parents have told the BBC that at least 100 students have not been found. The country's leader said surveillance aircraft and more troops were being sent to help with the search. Anger has been growing among parents about the government's handling of the incident, which has revived memories of the Chibok schoolgirl abduction four years ago. Dapchi, about 275km (170 miles) north-west of Chibok, came under attack on Monday, causing students and teachers to flee into the surrounding bush. Why January is Boko Haram's deadliest month Who are Nigeria's Boko Haram Islamist group? Residents say that Nigeria's security forces, backed by military jets, later repelled the attack. Authorities initially denied the students had been kidnapped, saying they were hiding from their attackers. The Nigerian president apologised for the attack on Friday, in his first extended comments about the incident. ""We are sorry that this could have happened. We pray that our gallant armed forces will locate and safely return your missing family members,"" he said in a statement. The Yobe state government had to apologise after mistakenly issuing a statement on Wednesday that said some of the girls had been saved by the army. The Nigerian activist group, Bring Back Our Girls, has been lobbying the government to release a list of names in order to clarify how many pupils are missing. The secret diaries of the Chibok girls What we know about Chibok kidnappings The group was established after the abduction almost four years ago of 276 girls from a school in Chibok. The location of more than 100 of those girls is still unknown. Residents of Dapchi told the AFP news agency that soldiers had been deployed in the town, but had left last month. Nigeria's defence spokesman denied that any troops had been withdrawn. Boko Haram militants have been fighting a long insurgency in the country's north in their quest for an Islamic state in the region. The conflict is estimated to have killed tens of thousands of people, and led to the abduction of thousands. Kidnapped Chibok girl rescued in Nigeria Who are Boko Haram?

"Sex abuse of groomed women 'extensive'After 700 victims were groomed in one region, ministers are told to urgently review exploitation laws.11h11 hours agoTyne & Wear","Eighteen people were jailed for their involvement in the sexual abuse of vulnerable young women in Newcastle Vulnerable women are most likely being ""extensively"" abused across the UK and ministers need to urgently review sex exploitation laws, a report says. David Spicer led a review in the wake of Operation Sanctuary which saw18 people jailedfor the sexual abuse ofyoung women groomed in Newcastle. He said exploitation was not being recognised in adults. The operation identified about 700 victims in total across the Northumbria Police area, 108 in Newcastle. Replay: Reaction to report into grooming The government said it would ""look carefully"" at Mr Spicer's 33 recommendations, which also included a need for research into the cultural background of abusers, many of whom in the case of Sanctuary were from a ""predominantly Asian or British Minority Ethnic culture or background"". Mr Spicer, whocarried out the serious case review,externalfor the Newcastle Safeguarding Adults and Children Boards, said it was clear ""adults were being targeted, groomed and exploited"" as well as children. But he said authorities did not have the powers to intervene with adults to stop them ""making bad choices"" or forming ""inappropriate relationships"". This video can not be played One victim of sexual exploitation in the city says abuse still continues He said: ""Vulnerability is not determined by age and it is likely that extensive abuse of vulnerable adults is taking place across the country unrecognised."" Operation Sanctuary started in 2014 after a 21-year-old woman with a learning disability told police she had been a victim of sexual exploitation over a long period. Further reports from two 19-year-old women ""confirmed"" sexual exploitation was a much larger problem in Newcastle ""than previously recognised"". Mr Spicer said the operation had proved successful but it was only when Northumbria Police and other agencies like Newcastle City Council started looking for the issue they found it. David Spicer led the serious case review He also said the government needs to research the ""profiles, motivations and cultural and background influences of perpetrators of sexual exploitation"". In the Newcastle case, most of the men were British-born but all came from Bangladeshi, Pakistani, Indian, Iraqi, Iranian or Turkish communities. The Quillam Foundation think tank, which focuses on counter-extremism, said84% of the 264 offenders it looked at, who were convicted of gang grooming between 2005 and 2017,,externalwere of south Asian heritage. Mr Spicer said the perpetrator he spoke to ""displayed no regret"" and ""spoke in a derogatory manner about a lack of morals in British girls"". The report noted that there was no evidence that police and other agencies had been reluctant to investigate amid ""misplaced"" concerns over political correctness or allegations of racism. Mr Spicer also said confidentiality systems in sexual health services should be reviewed as a lack of information-sharing meant no-one spotted victims who went to multiple clinics. Vulnerable adults were also sexually exploited in Newcastle Medical professionals such as pharmacists should also be trained to spot signs of abuse, he said. Mr Spicer was also critical of the ordeal of victims giving evidence in court saying several complained it caused ""lasting serious mental health problems"". As well as reviewing the way victims are treated during trials, Mr Spicer also said the terminology of charges should be changed to avoid causing further distress. This was after victims complained the charge of ""inciting prostitution"" labelled them as prostitutes. The report also looked at exploitation of boys and men but said it was ""complex and hidden"" and operated differently to female victims. Mr Spicer said: ""The low incidence of identified cases is likely to be a significant under-representation of the abuse occurring."" He also said it was not within the scope of his review to investigateNorthumbria Police's Â£10,000 payment to a convicted child rapistwho acted as an informant. A government spokesman said: ""These are abhorrent crimes that have had a devastating impact on the lives of the victims involved."" Changing Lives, a charity which supports victims of sexual exploitation including 33 associated with Operation Sanctuary, praised the report Director Laura Seebohm said the trauma ""cannot be underestimated"" and she welcomed the recommendations for ""national debate, review and guidance"". Vida Morris of Newcastle's adults safeguarding board said she was ""profoundly and deeply sorry for the emotional and physical trauma"" the victims suffered. She said the women had been ""brave beyond belief"" and thanks to them Newcastle was ""without a doubt a safer place"". Northumbria police and crime commissioner Vera Baird declined to be interviewed.

Bomb explodes outside Somali presidency,"The attack was claimed by Islamist militants Two car-bomb attacks have killed at least 38 people in the Somali capital Mogadishu, officials say. The first took place outside the presidential palace late on Friday. The second hit a nearby hotel.  Dozens of people were wounded. The Islamist militant group al-Shabab, which has been trying to oust Somalia's government, says it was behind both. A gun battle followed the attack near the presidential palace in which five militants were killed, officials say. Friday's bombings are the latest in a series of attacks attributed to al-Shabab, which once controlled Mogadishu before being forced out by African Union troops in 2011. Who are Somalia's al-Shabab? Somalia profile Last October, more than 500 people were killed by a truck bomb in the city. Officials blamed al-Shabab but the group never said it was behind that attack. Injured civilians were taken to hospital The latest incident began when a vehicle failed to stop at a checkpoint outside the presidential palace before being blown up, state media say. This was followed by an exchange of fire between militants and security forces. Then a parked car exploded near the hotel. However, al-Shabab said it had targeted security forces. The group said five of its fighters, including the two drivers, had been ""martyred"" and 35 soldiers were killed in the attacks.
