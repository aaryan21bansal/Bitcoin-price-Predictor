Columnist fired over 'anti-Semitic' article,"Vanessa Feltz and Claudia Winkleman are among the BBC's highest paid female stars A Sunday Times columnist ""will not write again"" for the newspaper after one of his articles was branded ""anti-Semitic"" and ""disgraceful"". In the piece, Kevin Myers suggested BBC presenters Claudia Winkleman and Vanessa Feltz earned high salaries because they were Jewish. Editor Martin Ivens said the piece, which appeared in the Irish edition and online, should not have been published. Mr Ivens has also apologised personally to the two women. A News UK spokesman said the column included ""unacceptable comments both to Jewish people and to women in the workplace"". News UK later clarified that the decision was an editorial one taken by the Sunday Times, not a corporate decision taken by its parent company. An apology will also be printed in next week's paper. The column, titled ""Sorry, ladies - equal pay has to be earned"", follows criticism of the BBC, after it was revealedtwo-thirds of its stars earning more than Â£150,000 are male. Commenting that two of the best-paid presenters, Winkleman and Feltz, were Jewish, Mr Myers wrote: ""Good for them. ""Jews are not generally noted for their insistence on selling their talent for the lowest possible price, which is the most useful measure there is of inveterate, lost-with-all-hands stupidity."" The article has been removed following outcry at its content In the article, Mr Myers also argued that male presenters may earn more because they ""work harder, get sick less frequently and seldom get pregnant"". It was taken down following anger on social media and a formal complaint from theCampaign Against Anti-Semitism,externalto press regulator Ipso. The campaign said the removal of the article and apology from editors within hours was ""proof that the decision to include the column was irrefutably wrong"". The group - which had earlier called for Mr Myers' sacking - also said he should ""no longer work as a journalist at any decent publication"". Times readers - who must pay a subscription to access online content - commented on the original article to express their disgust, and called for both the writer and editor to resign. ""The proud anti-Semitism in this column is nothing short of disgraceful. Myers must go and so must the editor who approved this piece,"" Alan Simpson wrote. ""I think I have to cancel my subscription if the Sunday Times continues to employ this sexist anti-Semite. I hope lots of others do the same,"" another reader, Andrew Gilbert, said.

Frank Fitzgibbon, editor of the Sunday Times Ireland, said he took ""full responsibility"", adding: ""This newspaper abhors anti-Semitism and did not intend to cause offence to Jewish people."" In 2009, Mr Myers wrote a column for the Irish Independent newspaper denying the Holocaust happened.It was removed,externalfollowing the criticism of his latest article.

Putin orders 755 US staff to leave,"President Putin said he did not expect an improvement in relations between Moscow (above) and Washington ""anytime soon"" Russian President Vladimir Putin has announced that 755 staff must leave US diplomatic missions, in retaliation for new US sanctions against Moscow. The decision to cut staff was made on Friday, but Mr Putin has now confirmed the number who must go by 1 September. It brings staff levels to 455, the same as Russia's complement in Washington. This is thought to be the largest action against diplomatic staff from any country in modern history, says the BBC's Laura Bicker in Washington. The number includes Russian employees of the US diplomatic missions across Russia, the BBC's Sarah Rainsford in Moscow adds. Staff in the embassy in Moscow as well as the consulates in Ekaterinburg, Vladivostok and St Petersburg are affected, she says. Should we worry about US-Russia diplomatic spat? Russia: The 'cloud' over the White House Reality Check: What are the sanctions against Russia? The US said the move was a ""regrettable and uncalled for act"". ""We are assessing the impact of such a limitation and how we will respond to it,"" a state department official said. It is not known exactly how many US citizens are employed in the diplomatic missions currently. However, aState Department Inspector General's report,externalin 2013 said more than 900 staff members were ""local hires"", with only 301 ""direct-hire"" staff, meaning it seems likely a far lower number than 755 will be actually forced to leave Russia. The ejections will bring the embassy numbers in Moscow and Washington to 455 Mr Putin did strike a conciliatory note, saying he did not want to impose more measures, but also said he could not see ties changing ""anytime soon"". Mr Putin told Russian television: ""More than 1,000 people were working and are still working"" at the US embassy and consulates, and that ""755 people must stop their activities in Russia"". Russia has also said it is seizing holiday properties and a warehouse used by US diplomats. Mr Putin suggested he could consider more measures, but said: ""I am against it as of today."" He also noted the creation of a de-escalation zone in southern Syria as an example of a concrete result of working together. However, in terms of general relations, he added: ""We have waited long enough, hoping that the situation would perhaps change for the better. ""But it seems that even if the situation is changing, it's not for anytime soon."" by Jonathan Marcus, BBC News, defence and diplomatic correspondent Russia hoped for a change in the climate; one where the lifting of many of the western sanctions imposed after its annexation of Crimea might become possible. But more than this, it wanted a new deal between the US and Russia that would acknowledge Moscow as an equal diplomatic player and indeed as a partner in trouble spots, such as Syria, and in the wider struggle against Islamist terror. These hopes have now come to nothing. This video can not be played The BBC's Sarah Rainsford tries to get Russian pop star Emin Agalarov to comment on his links to Donald Trump. Russia seems to have placed unrealistic hopes in what President Trump might achieve. Did Mr Putin see him as a forceful like-minded character, or as a political and diplomatic lightweight that might be manipulated and dominated? Either way Russia's own actions in intruding into the US political space and the subsequent investigations, have precluded any fresh start. Russia perhaps failed to understand the Congressional hostility to its activities, mistaking the Trump insiders' lack of concern for the predominant view of the president's supporters on Capitol Hill. Read more: The US and Russia: An uncertain path The new US sanctions were in retaliation both for Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 and Russian interference in the US election. In December, the Obama administration ordered the seizure of two Russian diplomatic compounds and expelled 35 Russian diplomats in response to alleged hacking of the US Democratic Party and Hillary Clinton's campaign. The new US sanctions on Russia were overwhelmingly approved by both houses of Congress, despite objections from President Donald Trump who wants warmer ties between the two countries. The White House said on Friday thathe would sign the sanctions billafter fears he could veto it. Mr Trump was believed to be particularly concerned about a provision in the new bill that limits his ability to lift sanctions - forcing him to consult Congress first. Some European countries are also angry because the new law could penalise European companies that invest in big Russian oil and gas projects such as the new Nord Stream II pipeline. US intelligence agencies believe Russia tried to sway the election in favour of Mr Trump and now there are several investigations looking into whether anyone from his campaign helped. Russia has always denied interfering and Mr Trump insists there was no collusion.

"'No value' in UN meeting on N Korea, says US","This video can not be played The US B-1 bombers were joined by South Korean and Japanese planes The US says it will not call for a UN Security Council meeting over North Korea's missile tests because it would produce ""nothing of consequence"". Such a meeting would send a message to North Korea that the international community was unwilling to challenge it, US Ambassador Nikki Haley said. Pyongyang said its tests proved that the entire US was within range. The US has responded by testing an anti-missile system and flying bombers over the Korean peninsula. On Monday, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said he had spoken to US President Donald Trump and they agreed on the need for further action on North Korea given its most recent missile test on Friday. The two did not discuss any use of military action. Ms Haleysaid in a statement,externalthat North Korea was already subject to numerous Security Council resolutions that they ""flout with impunity"". Ms Haley said a security council meeting would produce ""nothing of consequence"" ""An additional Security Council resolution that does not significantly increase the international pressure on North Korea is of no value,"" she said. ""In fact it is worse than nothing because it sends the message to the North Korean dictator that the international community is unwilling to seriously challenge him."" She urged China to rein in North Korea. ""China must decide whether it is finally willing to take this vital step. The time for talk is over,"" she added. What can the world do about North Korea? Why Beijing should lead on the North Korean crisis How the US might defend itself North Korea's missile programme On Friday, North Korea test-fired a second intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), claiming it proved that the entire US was within striking range. The launch came three weeks after the state's first ICBM test. Despite fierce objections from China, the US military recently began installing missile defences - the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (Thaad) system - in South Korea, with the aim of shooting down any North Korean missiles fired in conflict. The US says it has successfully shot down a ballistic missile in a test of its Thaad system On Sunday,the US military said,externala test of the Thaad equipment in Alaska had successfully brought down a projectile fired by the US Air Force over the Pacific. US B-1 bombers also conducted exercises over the Korean peninsula with South Korean and Japanese planes on Sunday. 'Spoiled child' US President Donald Trump has again criticised China for not doing enough to stop Pyongyang's weapons programme while making ""hundreds of billions of dollars"" in trade with the US. Mr Trump wrote on Twitter that he was ""very disappointed"" with China, adding that he would not allow it to ""do nothing"" about the isolated state. Victor Gao, a former diplomat and Chinese government adviser, said Mr Trump's comments were unhelpful, adding that the US was acting like a ""spoiled child"".

Aircraft 'at serious risk of collision',"This video can not be played Microlight pilot Tom Harding said the CitationJet was flying too fast Two aircraft only just missed colliding with each other over East Sussex because one of the pilots took evasive action, it has emerged. Footage shows a microlight and a CitationJet missing each other by just a few hundred feet near Eastbourne at 13:49 GMT on 7 March. Tom Harding, who was teaching a student in the microlight at the time, said the other plane was flying too fast. An Airprox Board report found there had been a ""serious risk of collision,external"". Mr Harding, a flight instructor with Flight Sport Aviation, said the Citation had been flying at a speed of 240 knots (276mph). On spotting the other aircraft, he was able to ""execute a steep turn to the right"". Student pilot Tom McNicholas recalled: ""It was extremely close to us. ""You could make out the whole jet... I just couldn't believe that we got that close."" The Airprox Board said ""providence had played a major part"", and assessed the risk as Category A. It said members were perplexed that the jet's onboard collision avoidance system had not triggered an alert. They also questioned whether it would have been better had both pilots been talking to a radar controller. Mr Harding has been commended for his robust lookout and appropriate evasive response.

Welsh internet via satellite over Africa,"This video can not be played Prof Christopher Spry is a self-confessed technology enthusiast Slow rural broadband has prompted one man to get his internet from a satellite 22,000 miles above Africa. Prof Christopher Spry, 79, who lives in Heol Senni in the Brecon Beacons, haddownload speedsof about 500Kbps He runs a community website and uploads weather data and nature videos, so paid Â£620 for satellite broadband, which comes from over the Democratic Republic of the Congo, via Luxembourg. ""It's an astonishing technological achievement,"" he said. Where Prof Spry lives also has sporadic 3G coverage so he researched his options and decided to invest in satellite technology. A BT spokesman said: ""Heol Senni is in scope to benefit from the scheme and work to provide access to superfast broadband to this rural community is anticipated to be completed in the early autumn."" The retired professor of immunology pays Â£420 a year for his satellite internet, which gives him download speeds of up to 28Mbps. Prof Christopher Spry has worked in London and Oxford and has owned his home in Powys since 1971 His broadband signal travels about 50,000 miles from a dish in his back garden to the ASTRA 2F satellite over the Earth's equator and back, via a company in Luxembourg. Companies such as Sky also use satellites similar to this to broadcast their TV signal. ""I'm interested in what's going on in the world, I'm a very inquisitive person, I'm asking questions all the time and I need to know so the web is a wonderful resource for all of us who need to know what's happening,"" he said. He also pays Â£250 a year for BT broadband, which he uses as a backup as heavy rain or snow can block the satellite signal and leave him cut off. But the nearest exchange is in Sennybridge - about five miles by road - so his broadband slows down when making the switch. Satellites are positioned over the equator to maintain geostationary orbit ""It really makes all the difference in the world, without it I think my life would be quite difficult up here... but it does need a satellite 24,000 miles above the surface of the earth over the Congo - it does seem ridiculous doesn't it,"" he said. ""Without broadband we're living in a dark age, so let's hope everybody can have high speed broadband soon and they'll be able to use it for whatever they want - entertainment, education, research - it's a wonderful tool for everybody."" Despite his best efforts, nature can still throw a spanner in the works when it comes to his satellite connection: ""It's pretty adequate for most of the programmes I need so I'm a happy rabbit - the only difficulty for me is that there's a tree in the way and I have to trim that!"" BT said more than nine out of every 10 homes and businesses in Wales were able to put in an order for superfast broadband. The Welsh Government also runs a scheme called Access Broadband Cymru which helps provide funds for satellite connectivity for properties not covered by the Superfast Cymru scheme. Nearly 600 homes and businesses have taken up the option since it started in January 2016. The UK Government announced on Sunday thathomes and businesses from all parts of the UKare set to benefit from universal high speed broadband.

President's daughter in breastfeeding row,"Aliya Shagieva said the row was because the female form had been hyper-sexualised A picture of the Kyrgyz president's youngest daughter feeding her baby dressed in her underwear has sparked a debate about breastfeeding and sexualisation. Aliya Shagieva posted the photo on social media back in April with the caption: 'I will feed my child whenever and wherever he needs to be fed.' She took the post down after being accused of immoral behaviour, but in an exclusive interview with the BBC she said the row was a result of a culture which hyper-sexualised the female form. ""This body I've been given is not vulgar. It is functional, its purpose is to fulfil the physiological needs of my baby, not to be sexualised,"" she told BBC Kyrgyz. This video can not be played Aliya Shagieva says her child simply needs to eat It wasn't only some social media users who disapproved. Her parents, President Almazbek Atambayev and his wife Raisa, were also unhappy. ""They really didn't like it.  And it is understandable because the younger generation is less conservative than their parents,"" Ms Shagieva said, speaking at her home on the outskirts of the Kyrgyz capital, Bishkek. Ms Shagieva posts actively on social media, including her own artwork and carefully stylized portraits of herself and her husband and baby, often set against the backdrop of wide open landscapes. Many of Ms Shagieva's pictures are set against the backdrop of Kyrgyz landscapes Breastfeeding is a recurring theme. ""When I'm breastfeeding my child I feel like I'm giving him the best I can give. Taking care of my baby and attending to his needs is more important to me than what people say about me,"" Ms Shagieva said. Breastfeeding at work: Women's stories Your stories: Breastfeeding toddlers Gulnara Kasmambetova, BBC Kyrgyz I interviewed Aliya Shagieva in her flat in a prestigious quarter of Bishkek which she shares with her husband and child. Her drawings and pictures were on the walls and the couple offered fruit and herbal tea.  Herbs were growing in pots on the window sills; the couple are vegetarian, a rarity in a traditionally meat-eating country. In the context of a post-Soviet traditional Muslim society, Aliya Shagieva is very bold and very different. She was quite open, sharing her experience of feeling lonely as a child of very busy parents. She spoke of the generation gap and her efforts to understand and find compromise with her parents, not least over her social media activities. ""My mum received messages from her 'friends' about me,"" she said. ""Now that I am a mother myself, I know what my mum went through raising me."" Aliya has been active supporting causes such as awareness of children with Downs syndrome and animal rights, but has no obvious political ambitions. People in Kyrgyzstan have recent memories of the two previous presidents' children getting involved in politics and business - both leaders were ousted. But the incumbent leader has pledged that his children will never meddle in politics. Aliya Shagieva is active in photography, painting and drawing Kyrgyzstan is a mainly Muslim ex-Soviet republic. It is socially conservative but breast feeding in public is acceptable. Women are seen in parks and other public spaces feeding their babies, but they usually try and cover their breasts with a piece of clothing. When Ms Shagieva's post first went online some social media users thought there was no need to post a picture of such an intimate moment; others denounced her for not being modest enough. And her breastfeeding photos attracted attention well beyond Kyrgyzstan - they were republished by newspapers and websites as far away as Europe. Many took to social media to praise her for breaking taboos surrounding women's bodies. The question of breastfeeding in public is a matter of debate in many countries, including the UK where only three years ago a woman was asked to cover up in the restaurant of London's famous Claridges Hotel while feeding her baby, causing an outcry. Claridge's breastfeeding row: Protest by mothers Australian politician becomes first to breastfeed in parliament Former Senator Larissa Waters made history when she breastfed in Australia's parliament in May When different BBC language services ran the interview with Aliya Shagieva, the resulting online conversation threw a light on different breastfeeding cultures and practices in Muslim countries. Women writing from Iran shared their experiences about the stress they feel when breastfeeding in public: ""People zoom in on me, I have to either cover myself and the baby or just leave him hungry,"" one Tehran mother wrote. Others praised the recently installed mother and baby rooms in Tehran's Metro. An employee of the Tehran metro sent pictures of mother and baby facilities at stations An Afghan woman from Kabul, Zarifa Ghafari, shared a story from her own extended family, saying mothers had to go into a separate room to breastfeed: ""She can't do this in front of others. If she did she would face strong reactions from the elder members of the family. It is a big issue but slowly, slowly the culture is changing."" Another Afghan woman, Nageen related a shopping trip with her sister in law. ""We had to buy some gifts just so she could feed her baby in a shop. She sat there and covered herself with a big scarf."" A Turkish Facebook user said, she herself preferred covering up while feeding her baby. ""I don't rub it in people's faces. I use a cover. There are many who still sexualize breasts."" Victoria Tahmasebi, a women and gender studies expert at Toronto university tweeted: ""From a capitalist view point women's breasts can create profit as long as they are sexualised. Breastfeeding in public makes women's breasts less sexy, therefore it is not acceptable."" As for Aliya Shagieva's picture which caused a stir - she finally took it down because her parents were worried that the attention ""could be harmful to her young family"". But it hasn't stopped her speaking out, and it hasn't stopped the debate.

Several acts at the Y Not event in Derbyshire had already been forced to cancel due to the conditions. Organisers said it had been an ""incredibly difficult decision"" but the state of the ground and stages had forced them to abandon Sunday's event. Fans on social media demanded refunds, which organisers have promised to provide ""further information"" about. Heavy rain on Saturday forced the decision, organisers said Some stalls will remain open for those staying on until Monday The news was announced via astatement on the festival website,external. Event director John Drape said he was ""gutted"" at what had happened. ""We have meetings every six hours to discuss things like weather conditions and ground conditions. ""On Saturday night it became increasingly clear conditions were deteriorating and at midnight there was not one agency which felt it was safe to continue."" Mr Drape denied festival organisers had been caught out, saying they had spent 30% more on infrastructure and had brought in 80 tonnes of woodchip to stabilise tracks. Allow Twitter content?

Julia Michaels: 'Dare to suck',"Chances are, you've heard Julia Michaels' music whether you know it or not. The songs she's written for other artists, including Justin Bieber's Sorry, Ed Sheeran's Dive and Selena Gomez's Hands To Myself, have clocked up more than 8 billion streams worldwide. They're all songs that feel deeply personal - even when the artist doesn't get a writing credit. And that's Julia's secret: She persuades pop stars to open up and spill their guts like a packet of Cornflakes. For years, she was content working behind the scenes, until she wrote a song she just couldn't give away. Issues,external, released in January, is as catchy as it is tender - with Michaels rejecting pop's prevailing narrative of the strong, independent woman to admit her vulnerabilities. ""When I'm down, I get real down / When I'm high, I don't come down,"" she sings over a crisp, pizzicato backing. ""Yeah, I got issues... and one of them is how bad I need you."" The singer's second live performance was at the closing ceremony of the 2016 Olympics in Rio ""I'm content with saying I have jealousy problems,"" the 23-year-old tells the BBC. ""I'm emotional. Sometimes I cry, just because - and I don't think anybody should have to hide that side of themselves. ""If people aren't going to be accepting of that, they don't deserve to be around you."" Michaels has found plenty of people who've accepted it. Issues has been viewed on YouTube more than 134 million times, and her next single,Uh Huh,external, is already catching up. ""It's insane,"" she marvels. ""I never expected that."" The day after her debut UK performance - at last month'sCapital Summertime Ball,external- the Iowa-born singer chatted to the BBC about going solo; her lonely childhood; and having ""eureka moments"" in the studio. Your real name is Julia Cavassos - why choose Julia Michaels as a stage name? My dad is Puerto Rican and when he moved to LA to be an actor, he was advised to change his last name to something more American, so he could go up for roles that were Italian, for example - because a lot of times they see the names before they see the photos. So of course he picked the most American name he could find: My dad was born Juan Manuel Cavassos and he changed it to John Michaels. When I was a kid, my mom tried to get me to act, too, so we just took my dad's stage name and I've had it ever since. Did you get any parts? No, that was definitely not on my cards. Writing was the thing I always wanted to do. The star has written her biggest hits with British composer Justin Tranter When did you realise you were good at writing? I've written for as long as I can remember but I guess it was when I won a poetry contest in fourth grade. What was the poem? I think it was something about love - and of course when you're in fourth grade you have no idea what that means. But I've always loved words. Growing up, it was my way of feeling less alone. Why did you feel that? My parents divorced when I was quite young and I wasn't super close to my siblingsandI was kind of an awkward kid. So I always felt like words were kind of my best friend. That was my way of getting my emotions out. Were you an avid reader? No, it's funny. I've never been much of a reader. I can read poetry but I can't read books. I don't know if it's my attention span, or if it's because I equate it to songwriting. When you write songs, you have to create an impression in three minutes; and that impression has to be fun or heartbreaking or something super messed up. It's the same with poetry. You have, like, 15 lines and there's your sentiment. Boom, it just hits you. So you're not reading Beowulf, then? No, no, no! The singer says she has a ""ready-made"" fanbase, after Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez fans sought her out on social media When you're writing a lyric, how much editing and redrafting do you do? I kind of self-edit as I go. I'm not the kind of person to write a song then revisit it a week later. Usually, if it doesn't feel right we fix it in the moment. There's a line in the Selena Gomez songHands To Myself,externalthat's been called one of the best pop lyrics of recent times - but she told me you improvised it. Is that true? I tend to do a lot of things spontaneously, just singing into the mic. So I was doing the bridge - ""can't keep my hands to myself"" - and when we stopped, I said, ""wait, guys, I have an idea. It could be really dumb but let's roll with it"". And then I just sang, ""I mean I could - but why would I want to"" and they just went, ""Ooooooh!"" Sometimes it just pops into your head. Like a little light bulb going off. You said ""this might be dumb"" - but I guess it's important to be vulnerable in the studio... Shelly Peiken, who's a really incredible songwriter, used to say ""dare to suck"". You never know what people's reactions are going to be, so you've got to take chances. Michaels is still writing for other projects, including Selena Gomez's forthcoming album What made you want to step into the limelight and sing your own songs? It was when I wrote Issues. I'd always written personal songs, but this one was very, very personal. I'd had a fight with my boyfriend - who's my ex-boyfriend now, we broke up last week. Anyway, we'd gotten in a stupid fight and I wrote the song that day, and there were a couple of artists that really wanted to sing it. But because I'd written about me and him so specifically, in that relationship, I just felt uncomfortable having somebody else sing something so personal. So that was the point where I emailed Charlie Walk (head of Republic Records) and said, ""I think I'm ready to do this"". So people had been asking before? Oh yeah. And I was like, ""No, guys, stop! I'm a songwriter. Leave me alone!"" Was it hard to move from singing backing vocals to being the lead? No. I've sung every template vocal of every song I've written, so I'm used to performing it the way the artist would sing it. So that's never been a problem for me. Issues is about having strength in vulnerability. Why did you choose that message for your first single? I feel like nowadays, women feel like they have to suppress their emotions because they don't want to be the stereotype ""emotional girl"". There's nothing more annoying than a guy saying, ""You're too sensitive"". I hate that. Not everybody is unicorns and rainbows all the time. And if people can't stick around for the hardship then, no, they don't deserve to be around you. But the song's not just for women. Men suppress their emotions all the time and it's really sad because there's so much power in being OK with who you are. The singer's second ever live performance was at the closing ceremony of the 2016 Olympics Uh-Huh is perhaps more straightforward, in that it's about fancying the pants off someone. Definitely. That song came from an experience I had with somebody, where I really wanted him to make the move. Like, desperate for it. And we were both so nervous. So what happened with this guy? Did one of you make the move? It's still pending! You've got to ask him out, now that you've confessed everything in a song! I know. I know! I totally do. You're about to release your first EP. What can we expect? Well, I tend to only know two sides of myself at this moment, as a 23-year-old woman. I know my emotional side, and I know my playful, more sexual side. And because I know those things, those are the things I tend to write about. So a lot of it is going to be touching on those situations and, in lieu of recent events, there will be a lot of heartbreak situations. So you're replacing some of the songs right now? Yes. There is no silver lining to a breakup but the writing. But wait - doesn't that mean you can ask the other guy out now? Yes! Yes I can!

William and Kate remember WW1 battle,"The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have joined Prime Minister Theresa May in Belgium to mark the centenary of the start of the Battle of Passchendaele - one of the bloodiest of World War One. Half a million Allied and German soldiers were killed, wounded or went missing in three months of fighting. Prince William said Britain and Belgium ""stand together... in remembrance of that sacrifice"". He joined the Belgian king to lay wreaths at the Menin Gate in Ypres. The gate - which stands where British troops marched when heading to the battlefields - is covered with the names of 54,391 British dead who have no known grave, according to the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. Passchendaele's untold army of women nurses Ypres lights up to remember dark past Denis was 19 when he died in WW1 battle WW1 missing Ypres bells on show Officially known as the Third Battle of Ypres, Passchendaele was fought between 31 July and 6 November 1917 in the West Flanders region of northern Belgium. About 275,000 Allied troops and 220,000 Germans were killed, wounded or went missing. On Monday, the duke and duchess, Prince Charles and Theresa May will attend a service and lay wreaths at Tyne Cot cemetery near Ypres where thousands of soldiers are buried. This video can not be played The Last Post has been played at the Menin Gate almost every evening since 1928 During Sunday's commemorations, attended by 200 descendents of those who fought, Prince William said: ""Members of our families; our regiments; our nations; all sacrificed everything for the lives we live today. ""During the First World War Britain and Belgium stood shoulder to shoulder. One hundred years on, we still stand together, gathering as so many do every night, in remembrance of that sacrifice."" WW1 'melting' mud sculpture unveiled 'I was named after a World War One battle' Scots mark Passchendaele centenary King Philippe of Belgium added that both countries would continue to honour the soldiers' ""immense sacrifice"". The names of soldiers whose remains were never found are engraved on the Menin Gate in Ypres Paper poppies were dropped from the Menin Gate at the end of the service The service ended with the Last Post, which has been played at the gate by a bugler almost every evening since 1928. Thousands of paper poppies were also dropped from the roof of the gate to represent every name engraved there. By Kate Palmer, BBC News, in Ypres The lonely, eerie sound of a bugle is one that locals in Ypres are well used to. But for the thousands of Britons gathered around Menin Gate - a memorial of white stone - it may be the first time they have heard a melody that has sounded almost every night for 90 years. Standing by the vast stone arch were British and Belgian royals, but also many relatives of soldiers who fought in the battle. Robert Lloyd-Rees, 75, says it is 60 years since he heard the Last Post, having first visited Ypres with his father Tom, who served at Passchendaele in 1917. He says the service is ""tearful"". Father and son Phil and Luke were also outside the gate to remember their relative - Sgt Herbert Seeley - who was injured four times but sent back to the front. ""Goosebumps,"" says Phil. A short walk away, Ypres' medieval Cloth Hall, which was rebuilt from ruins after the war, has been illuminated. There is a sense of excitement in the city, as well as quiet contemplation. Cloth Hall in Ypres' Market Square was lit up during the event Dignitaries and the relatives of those who died also gathered in Ypres's Market Square for an event to tell the story of the battle. There were a number of musical and spoken performances - including from the National Youth Choir of Scotland and Dame Helen Mirren, and of a specially written piece by War Horse author Michael Morpurgo. All of them were set to a backdrop of light projections on to the historic Cloth Hall. Dame Helen Mirren was one of the narrators of the story of Passchendaele in Ypres' Market Square A specially written scene by War Horse author Michael Morpurgo was performed Journalist Ian Hislop introduced a sketch from his First World War play The Wipers Times. And testimonies from Allied and German soldiers were also projected on to the side of the imposing Cloth Hall, including a video of Harry Patch - known as the ""Last Tommy"" - who fought at Passchendaele and died aged 111 in 2009. Those who fought at Passchendaele included Harry Patch, known as the ""Last Tommy"" who died aged 111 in 2009 Passchendaele became infamous not only for the scale of casualties, but also for the mud. Constant shelling before the attack began had churned the soil and smashed drainage systems. Within a few days, the heaviest rain for 30 years had turned the soil into a quagmire. The thick mud clogged up rifles and immobilised tanks, eventually becoming so deep that men and horses drowned in it. On 16 August the attack was resumed, but to little effect. This stalemate continued and further attacks in October failed to make much progress. The eventual capture of what little remained of Passchendaele village by British and Canadian forces on 6 November led to the offensive being called off. On Monday, the anniversary of the start of the battle, commemorations will continue with a special service held at Tyne Cot cemetery, where thousands are buried and commemorated. More than 4,000 descendants and relatives of those who fought have won tickets to the event in a ballot run by the government. Prime Minister Theresa May and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will also be at the ceremony at Tyne Cot cemetery near Ypres. They will lay wreaths at the site of 11,000 graves of Commonwealth soldiers. During the service, military personnel and descendants will read out letters and diaries from soldiers who fought at Passchendaele.

US reacts to N Korea with military show,"This video can not be played The US B-1 bombers were joined by South Korean and Japanese planes The US says it will not call for a UN Security Council meeting over North Korea's missile tests because it would produce ""nothing of consequence"". Such a meeting would send a message to North Korea that the international community was unwilling to challenge it, US Ambassador Nikki Haley said. Pyongyang said its tests proved that the entire US was within range. The US has responded by testing an anti-missile system and flying bombers over the Korean peninsula. On Monday, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said he had spoken to US President Donald Trump and they agreed on the need for further action on North Korea given its most recent missile test on Friday. The two did not discuss any use of military action. Ms Haleysaid in a statement,externalthat North Korea was already subject to numerous Security Council resolutions that they ""flout with impunity"". Ms Haley said a security council meeting would produce ""nothing of consequence"" ""An additional Security Council resolution that does not significantly increase the international pressure on North Korea is of no value,"" she said. ""In fact it is worse than nothing because it sends the message to the North Korean dictator that the international community is unwilling to seriously challenge him."" She urged China to rein in North Korea. ""China must decide whether it is finally willing to take this vital step. The time for talk is over,"" she added. What can the world do about North Korea? Why Beijing should lead on the North Korean crisis How the US might defend itself North Korea's missile programme On Friday, North Korea test-fired a second intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), claiming it proved that the entire US was within striking range. The launch came three weeks after the state's first ICBM test. Despite fierce objections from China, the US military recently began installing missile defences - the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (Thaad) system - in South Korea, with the aim of shooting down any North Korean missiles fired in conflict. The US says it has successfully shot down a ballistic missile in a test of its Thaad system On Sunday,the US military said,externala test of the Thaad equipment in Alaska had successfully brought down a projectile fired by the US Air Force over the Pacific. US B-1 bombers also conducted exercises over the Korean peninsula with South Korean and Japanese planes on Sunday. 'Spoiled child' US President Donald Trump has again criticised China for not doing enough to stop Pyongyang's weapons programme while making ""hundreds of billions of dollars"" in trade with the US. Mr Trump wrote on Twitter that he was ""very disappointed"" with China, adding that he would not allow it to ""do nothing"" about the isolated state. Victor Gao, a former diplomat and Chinese government adviser, said Mr Trump's comments were unhelpful, adding that the US was acting like a ""spoiled child"".

Violence at ex-EDL leader's book signing,"The ex-leader of the EDL, Tommy Robinson, had been in Sunderland for a book signing Police were called in after trouble flared at a book signing in Sunderland by the English Defence League founder Tommy Robinson. Violence broke out at Saturday's event, which was staged in an off-licence shortly before a Sunderland-Celtic match being held the same day. Police attended Fletcher's News and Booze, where an 18-year-old man suffered a head injury and needed hospital treatment. Twenty-one arrests were made in total. Officers said the majority were unrelated to Mr Robinson's book signing and included people being drunk and disorderly, committing a breach of the peace and using illegal pyrotechnics. Emergency services had been called to the off-licence in Hendon at about 13:40 BST. The pre-season match was organised to mark 20 years since the opening of Sunderland's Stadium of Light The force said Mr Robinson was wearing a Glasgow Rangers shirt - the arch rivals of Celtic. Footage posted on social media showed a flare and other objects being thrown towards the shop before fighting broke out on the street. The pre-season match was organised to mark 20 years since the opening of Sunderland's Stadium of Light and 50 years since Celtic won the European Cup.

German club gunman 'opened fire after row',"Investigators say the gunman acted alone The gunman who killed one person at a German nightclub was the Iraqi Kurdish son-in-law of the nightclub's owner, German authorities said. He returned to the Grey nightclub in the southern city of Konstanz armed with an M16 rifle after having been thrown out following an argument, a state prosecutor said. The victim was a doorman. Several others were wounded including a police officer. The gunman was killed by police. Hundreds of revellers are thought to have been at Grey at the time of the shooting. They either fled outside in terror or found places to hide as the shooting unfolded. The wounded police officer's life had been saved by his helmet, which deflected a bullet fired by the gunman, Andreas Stenge from the Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg criminal investigation office said at a press conference. Mr Stenge said the M16 was an ""absolute war weapon"" and said the gunman appeared to know how to handle it. The 34-year-old had come to police attention twice in the past, police said. Police chief Ekkehard Falk said a police strategy to swiftly disable the gunman had prevented further casualties. The Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg authorities have ruled out a terrorist motive for the incident.

Officials killed as Venezuela votes,"This video can not be played Clashes and demonstrations took place in the capital Caracas on Sunday Venezuela's election of a controversial new assembly has been disrupted by violence, with widespread protests and at least 10 deaths reported. Those killed include an opposition youth leader, a pro-government candidate and a soldier. The government wants a new constituent assembly with powers to rewrite the constitution and override congress. The opposition says it is a power grab by President NicolÃ¡s Maduro and is boycotting the vote. President Maduro says it is the only way to restore peace after months of protests and political stalemate between the government and the opposition controlled National Assembly. Early results are expected within the coming hours. What are Venezuelans voting for? Why Venezuela is at breaking point When a simple cut can mean death What is behind the crisis in Venezuela? As well as internal opposition, Venezuela faces mounting international criticism over the election and on Sunday the US said it was considering further sanctions. As voting got under way on Sunday morning, anti-government protesters took to the streets despite a government ban and there were reports of clashes with police across the country. At least three people were reported shot dead in the western state of Tachira - two teenagers and a soldier from the national guard. Ricardo Campos, a youth secretary with the opposition AcciÃ³n DemocrÃ¡tica party, was shot dead during a protest in the north-eastern town of Cumana, prosecutors said. A police officer was wounded in this explosion near the Altamira Square in Caracas Shortly before voting started, JosÃ© Felix Pineda, a 39-year-old lawyer standing in the election, was also reportedly shot in his home in Bolivar state. In the capital Caracas, an explosion near one demonstration injured several police officers and set a number of their motorcycles on fire. Security forces used armoured vehicles to dispel protesters in the Caracas district of El ParaÃ­so amid the sound of gunfire, local reports said. Voting was extended by an hour until 19:00 (23:00 GMT), electoral officials said, to allow all votes to be cast. The opposition urged further protests on Monday. ""We do not recognise this fraudulent process,"" said opposition leader Henrique Capriles. Will Grant, BBC News, Caracas In the capital, voting was peaceful in many neighbourhoods but there were sporadic clashes between protesters and the security forces, especially in traditionally opposition-controlled areas. With many thoroughfares closed by local citizens erecting barricades of wood, scrap metal and barbed wire, further confrontation seems inevitable. President Maduro will no doubt claim a resounding victory. But with the opposition boycotting the vote and with the security forces controlling the cities in riot gear it was always going to be an uncontested election. The challenge will be governing afterwards in this conflicted political environment. Four months of protests against Mr Maduro and his plans for the assembly have left more than 100 people dead. The election has been heavily criticised by other Latin American countries as well as by the European Union and the US. Venezuela has said it will withdraw from the Organisation of American States (OAS) after members including the US, Canada and Mexico said they would not recognise the authority of the assembly. Venezuela has already been suspended from regional economic bloc Mercosur by fellow-members Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay, following concern over human rights. On Sunday, the US ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, dismissed the vote as a ""sham election"" and a ""step towards dictatorship"". Allow Twitter content?

Sunday Times removes 'anti-Semitic' column,"Vanessa Feltz and Claudia Winkleman are among the BBC's highest paid female stars A Sunday Times columnist ""will not write again"" for the newspaper after one of his articles was branded ""anti-Semitic"" and ""disgraceful"". In the piece, Kevin Myers suggested BBC presenters Claudia Winkleman and Vanessa Feltz earned high salaries because they were Jewish. Editor Martin Ivens said the piece, which appeared in the Irish edition and online, should not have been published. Mr Ivens has also apologised personally to the two women. A News UK spokesman said the column included ""unacceptable comments both to Jewish people and to women in the workplace"". News UK later clarified that the decision was an editorial one taken by the Sunday Times, not a corporate decision taken by its parent company. An apology will also be printed in next week's paper. The column, titled ""Sorry, ladies - equal pay has to be earned"", follows criticism of the BBC, after it was revealedtwo-thirds of its stars earning more than Â£150,000 are male. Commenting that two of the best-paid presenters, Winkleman and Feltz, were Jewish, Mr Myers wrote: ""Good for them. ""Jews are not generally noted for their insistence on selling their talent for the lowest possible price, which is the most useful measure there is of inveterate, lost-with-all-hands stupidity."" The article has been removed following outcry at its content In the article, Mr Myers also argued that male presenters may earn more because they ""work harder, get sick less frequently and seldom get pregnant"". It was taken down following anger on social media and a formal complaint from theCampaign Against Anti-Semitism,externalto press regulator Ipso. The campaign said the removal of the article and apology from editors within hours was ""proof that the decision to include the column was irrefutably wrong"". The group - which had earlier called for Mr Myers' sacking - also said he should ""no longer work as a journalist at any decent publication"". Times readers - who must pay a subscription to access online content - commented on the original article to express their disgust, and called for both the writer and editor to resign. ""The proud anti-Semitism in this column is nothing short of disgraceful. Myers must go and so must the editor who approved this piece,"" Alan Simpson wrote. ""I think I have to cancel my subscription if the Sunday Times continues to employ this sexist anti-Semite. I hope lots of others do the same,"" another reader, Andrew Gilbert, said.

Two dead in German nightclub shooting,"Police officers stand at the door of the nightclub ""Grey"" in Constance, where the shooting took place A gunman has been shot dead by German police after opening fire at a nightclub in the city of Konstanz. One person was killed and three seriously injured in the attack at about 04:30 (02:30 GMT) on Sunday. The shooter targeted the Grey club in an industrial part of the city, on Max-Stromeyer-Strasse. Police have ruled out a terrorist motive. A spokesperson told N-TV that the gunman was a 34-year-old Iraqi citizen, but not an asylum seeker. He is believed to have lived in Germany for a long time. Hundreds of revellers are thought to have been at the club. Police said they either fled outside in terror, or found places to hide as the shooting unfolded. A doorman appeared to have been shot with an automatic weapon as he tried to stop the attacker, witnesses told broadcaster SWR. One police officer was also wounded in the exchange of fire. The officer's injuries are not thought to be life-threatening. Police and prosecutorssaid in a statement,external(in German) that special commando forces and a police helicopter had been deployed, as it was not yet known if the suspect had accomplices.

"Lucy, 22, has motor neurone disease. Her worst fear is...","Lucy had her picture taken by famous portrait photographer Rankin There are plenty of things that make having Motor Neurone Disease (MND) ""crappy"" but losing the ability to speak and laugh would be too much, says Lucy Lintott. The 22-year-old was diagnosed with MND three years ago, making her the youngest person in Scotland with the terminal disease. MND, which usually affects people over 40, gradually makes gripping, walking, talking and swallowing extremely difficult - and eventually impossible. Lucy has raised Â£120,000 for research into MND It kills about a third of people within a year and more than half within two years. Lucy tells the BBC Scotland documentaryMND and the 22-year-old Methat it is like being ""slowly paralysed"". As the condition progressively takes hold she worries that her ""hilarious personality will slip away"". Over the past three years she has had to deal with using a wheelchair more as she can no longer walk unaided, but losing her voice holds new fears for the self-confessed ""chatterbox"". Lucy can no longer walk unassisted and has to use a wheelchair ""If I did lose my voice it would be the worst thing for me,"" she says. ""I could cope with everything else, just not losing my voice. ""I don't think I'd be able to handle that because most people know me for my weird-ass laugh."" This video can not be played Lucy has been recording the sound of her voice Lucy, from Garmouth in Moray, first started experiencing difficulties with her balance and co-ordination at a summer camp in the US. Her friends say she kept falling down and was slurring her words. When she returned home she had a strange limp and was referred to a neurologist, who eventually diagnosed MND. Lucy's father Robert says: ""He just started talking matter-of-fact saying 'it's a terminal illness, no cure, you've got about three years to live'."" MND, also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), occurs when specialist nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord, called motor neurones, stop working properly. It is a relatively rare disease, affecting up to 5,000 adults in the UK at any one time. Lucy says: ""I am the youngest [in Scotland] living with MND. ""So it's not as if I can ask a granny or grandpa how they have dealt with it, or a mother or father, because it's completely irrelevant. ""There was no-one my age who I could really talk to."" Lucy with her sister Laura So after her diagnosis, Lucy moved back from Glasgow, where she had been studying, and tried to make sense of her condition. Shewrote a bucket list of things,externalshe wanted to do,started publishing online blogs,externaland began raising money to help the search for a cure for MND. So far, she has raised more than Â£120,000, some of which is goinginto studying zebra fishat the Euan MacDonald Centre for MND research in Edinburgh. ""Unlike me this amazing little fish can rebuild its motor neurones even after its spinal cord has been damaged,"" she tells the documentary. At the moment there is no known cure for the disease. Lucy adds: ""There is so little promise for people with MND. I've even heard it referred to as death sentence. ""I hate it when people say 'death sentence'. It gets me so mad."" Her mother Lydia says: ""It is just acceptance that you cannot do anything about MND at the moment. ""It is just a waiting game to see how long we have got her for really, but hopefully they can find a cure or help that will be in time for Lucy."" Lucy, a big country music fan, with singer Reba McEntire In very rare cases, such as the cosmologist Stephen Hawking, people can live with the disease for decades. He has famously spoken via a voice simulator for 30 years. In preparation for the possibility that she might need similar technology, Lucy visited the voice bank in Edinburgh to record her speech. However, due to the effect the disease has already had, the technicians sought to blend Lucy's voice with that of her older sister Laura. ""I genuinely don't think I'll get to that point where I'll need it,"" Lucy says. ""But if I am wrong I'll still have my voice to use and mum and dad will still have to listen to me."" Despite travelling the world ticking off items on her list and raising thousands for charity, Lucy admits that it has become very tiring and she no longer goes out very much. Photographer Rankin, pictured here with Lucy, said she was dealing with something very tough A visit to renowned portrait photographer Rankin at his London studio brought home to her how much MND had changed her life. Paisley-born Rankin, who has photographed celebrities from Madonna and Kate Moss to the Queen, has also created many images showing the ""defiance, strength and vitality"" of people with terminal illnesses. He tells the documentary: ""Obviously I am dealing with a really young girl who is facing something that she should not be facing."" Viewing the images created by the photographer is an emotional moment for Lucy, reminding her of her old self before the illness. Rankin says: ""It is a very revealing, a very tough thing to do, because she is looking at a photograph and she can see what she could be."" Lucy says: ""When I saw the photographs I cried because it was like me before I was diagnosed - before my life really changed. ""In that moment I realised that up until that moment I'd seen myself as two different people. ""There was the Lucy Lintott who was adventurous, fun-loving, crazy and clumsy - I suppose the more perfect one of the two. ""Then MND Lucy who is terminally ill and needs people to live really. ""It just overwhelmed me that I was still the Lucy of before. ""It allowed me to mould myself back together and realise I'm still the same person and that only parts of me have changed.""

Fox holds firm on opposing free movement,"Unregulated free movement of people after Brexit would ""not keep faith"" with the EU referendum result, the international trade secretary has said. Ina Sunday Times interview,,externalLiam Fox said he had ""not been party"" to widely-reported talks about a ""transitional"" period when free movement is retained. Chancellor Philip Hammond has said ""it will be some time"" before full migration controls can be introduced. Mr Fox said border controls had been a key element of the Brexit referendum. He added: ""Unregulated free movement would seem to me not to keep faith with that decision. ""I am very happy to discuss whatever transitional arrangements and whatever implementation agreement we might want, but that has to be an agreement by the cabinet. ""It can't just be made by an individual or any group within the cabinet."" On that basis, Mr Fox cast doubt on claims that the free movement of EU citizens would remain in place for up to three years after the UK leaves the EU as part of a Brexit transition deal. ""If there have been discussions on that, I have not been party to them,"" he said. ""I have not been involved in any discussion on that, nor have I signified my agreement to anything like that."" On Friday, Mr Hammond said free movement would end in name only in 2019. The chancellor said ""many things will look similar"" the day after Brexit. ""It will be some time before we are able to introduce full migration controls between the UK and the European Union,"" he added. Mr Hammond said any transitional deal in the period after Brexit must end by June 2022, the time of the next general election. But he said there must be ""business as usual, life as normal"" for Britons as the UK left the EU. BBC political correspondent Chris Mason says Mr Fox's interview lays bare division in the cabinet. Our correspondent added: ""The government's negotiations with Brussels over Brexit are yet to touch on any transitional period after March 2019.

Diana video and Brexit debate,"The Observer says the two main Westminster parties go into the summer recess with a series of unresolved internal issues about the ""how and when"" of Brexit. It says tensions remain within Labour over whether the UK should remain in the single market during any transitional period after Brexit, while ministers are still at odds over major parts of a final deal. But theMail on Sunday finds it reassuring,externalthat a Brexit debate is at last taking place. It says Chancellor Philip Hammond has shifted the debate away from ""how do we achieve a hard Brexit"" to ""how do we achieve a wise Brexit that does not needlessly damage the economy"". For the Sunday Telegraph,external, things are starting to come together - with individual ministers starting to draw up plans for what life will be like after UK leaves the EU.

According to the paper, an end to the freeze in fuel duty and a cut in higher-rate pension tax relief are on the cards, as is postponing the 2020 target for letting people earn Â£12,500 before they pay income tax.

BT offers broadband for 99% of UK,"Some remote homes have struggled to get decent broadband connections BT has offered to provide the infrastructure for 99% of premises in the UK to get broadband speeds of at least 10 megabits per second by 2020. If accepted, it would mean government-proposed rules, allowing those living in remote areas to demand broadband, were unnecessary. BT says it would invest up to Â£600m and coverage would be universal by 2022. About 1.4 million households currently cannot get speeds above 10Mbps, according to Ofcom. This figure is disputed by a group of MPs who say there are a further 5.3 million who have not chosen to take up faster broadband services, some of whom may also not be able to get 10Mbps speeds. In a recently published report, they called on regulator Ofcom to more clearly distinguish between the take-up and actual availability of fast broadband. The government has proposed a universal service obligation (USO), designed to help remote households get fast broadband more quickly, by granting them the right to request broadband speeds of at least 10Mbps - speeds which the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport says would ""meet the typical needs of a family"". That proposal is currently under consultation. BT's alternative proposal would see the company rolling out the necessary infrastructure ""proactively"" rather than waiting for a request. The investment would be recouped through customers' bills. The government will now consider whether to abandon the USO in light of BT's offer. The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said it would consult on BT's proposal, adding that, if the offer was accepted, it would be legally binding. Culture Secretary Karen Bradley said: ""We warmly welcome BT's offer and now will look at whether this or a regulatory approach works better for homes and businesses. ""Whichever of the two approaches we go with in the end, the driving force behind our decision-making will be making sure we get the best deal for consumers."" But Labour's shadow culture secretary Tom Watson said that the 10Mbps target was low and warned that customers must not be forced to pay more. He said: ""Families and businesses in areas without the minimum speed may see some hope in this announcement, but they will be rightly wary that they will be forced to pay the price in extra or hidden charges. That would not be acceptable and the government must take that into account. ""Businesses will also be concerned that the 10 Mbps minimum broadband speed will be outdated and inadequate before it is even fully delivered. Rather than choose an ambitious broadband speed the government went with the cheapest, which will leave us running to catch up with digital developments for years to come."" The telecoms firm claimed that by using a range of technologies, including fibre and fixed wireless, broadband can reach 99% of the UK by 2020. By 2022 BT suggests less than 1% of customers would receive broadband via satellite, rather than built infrastructure. It added that it was already well on the way to offering fast services around the country, with 95% of premises able to access speeds of 24Mbps or faster by the end of 2017. It estimated that the rollout would cost between Â£450m and Â£600m and would largely be delivered by BT's spun-off network firm Openreach. ""Our latest initiative aims to ensure that all UK premises can get faster broadband, even in the hardest to reach parts of the UK,"" said BT chief executive Gavin Patterson. There have been criticisms that the UK was falling behind other nations in both the availability and speed of broadband services. The universal service obligation (USO) - which the government planned to roll out in 2020 - would have meant that everyone, regardless of where they live, would have the right to request a broadband connection, and BT would have to provide the infrastructure. It was seen as a way to speed up broadband rollout to remote areas which for years have languished on slower net speeds because providers such as BT and Virgin Media saw no profit in offering services to areas with small populations. BT's announcement comes after figures were released by the British Infrastructure Group of MPsshowing the worst areas in the UK for broadband. Telecoms regulator Ofcom forced BT to legally separate its broadband infrastructure division Openreach in March. The move was intended to shake up UK broadband, with the view that an independent Openreach would deliver better customer service and investment in broadband. Since the split, Openreach has pledged to offer super-fast fibre broadband to 10 million homes by 2025, using technology known as fibre to the premises (FTTP) which it had previously said was too expensive for wide rollout.

'Two dead' in German nightclub shooting,"Police officers stand at the door of the nightclub ""Grey"" in Constance, where the shooting took place A gunman has been shot dead by German police after opening fire at a nightclub in the city of Konstanz.

Record 141 criminal sentences increased,"A record number of criminals have had their sentences increased after people complained that they were too lenient. The Attorney General's Office said 141 terms were added to in England and Wales in 2016 under the Unduly Lenient Sentence scheme, up by 39 from 2015. These included 41 sex offences, 19 of grievous bodily harm with intent and 16 involving robbery. Only one person needs toask for a sentence to be reviewed,external, and anyone - not just the victim - can request it. Thirty offenders - including an arsonist, someone carrying a firearm and two men guilty of child neglect - had community sentences replaced with immediate custody. Fourteen sex offenders who originally escaped being sent to prison are now serving time. One rapist and one attempted murderer had their determinate sentences replaced with life sentences. There were 837 requests for a review, a 17% rise on the previous year. The Attorney General and Solicitor General referred 190 cases to the Court of Appeal to be looked at again, compared with 135 in 2015. The increases represent a tiny proportion of the 80,000 Crown Court cases heard each year. Attorney General Jeremy Wright QC said: ""The Unduly Lenient Sentence scheme allows victims of crime, their families and the public to challenge sentences that they believe are too low, and last year we saw a record number of sentences increased. ""A sentencing exercise is not an exact science and in the vast majority of cases, judges get it right. ""The scheme is available to ensure that the Solicitor General and I can independently review those cases where there may have been an error in the sentencing decision."" From 8 August, an additional 19 terror-related offences will be added to the list of sentences that can be increased if found to be unduly lenient.

Trump criticises China over N Korea,"This video can not be played The US B-1 bombers were joined by South Korean and Japanese planes US President Donald Trump says he is ""very disappointed"" with China for not doing enough to stop North Korea's weapons programme. Writing on Twitter, he said he would not allow China to ""do nothing"" about the reclusive state. His comments came a day after Pyongyang test-fired its second intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) in a month. It later claimed the test proved that the entire US was within striking range of its weaponry. On Saturday, two US B-1 bombers conducted exercises over the Korean peninsula with South Korean and Japanese planes. The move was a ""direct response"" to the North's two ICBM launches, and ""part of the continuing demonstration of ironclad US commitment to our allies"", the US Pacific Command said.

On Saturday, China condemned the test launch and urged restraint on all sides. But Mr Trump voiced frustration at Beijing's response, linking the US trade deficit with China with policy on North Korea. ""I am very disappointed in China. Our foolish past leaders have allowed them to make hundreds of billions of dollars a year in trade, yet they do NOTHING for us with North Korea, just talk,"" he wrote in two consecutive tweets. ""We will no longer allow this to continue. China could easily solve this problem!"" Why Beijing should lead on the North Korean crisis China, which shares a land border with North Korea, is its closest economic ally and trading partner. North Korean TV showed pictures of leader Kim Jong-un celebrating the launch President Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping discussed North Korea during talks earlier this year, after which US officials said the two countries were working on ""a range of options"" to rein in Pyongyang. But since then the North has carried out two ICBM tests. How the US might defend itself Are Alaskans scared of Kim Jong-un? After Saturday's launch, South Korea said it was concerned the North may have made ""a significant advancement in technology"", adding that the missile test was ""unique in its time and place of launch"". Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said the threat to his country's security was ""grave and real"". The North has repeatedly tested missiles in breach of UN resolutions. This video can not be played Why does North Korea want nukes? ICBMs can reach altitudes well outside the earth's atmosphere. Using sharp trajectories with high altitudes allows North Korea to avoid firing over neighbouring countries. Despite the ongoing tests, experts believe the North does not yet have the capability to miniaturise a nuclear warhead, fit it on to a long-range missile, and ensure it is protected until delivery to the target. Others, however, believe that at the rate it is going, Pyongyang may overcome these challenges and develop a nuclear weapon within five to 10 years that could strike the US.

Call for Scotch to be defined in UK law,"The Scottish government has called for Scotch to be defined in UK law in order to protect whisky exports after Brexit. Scotland's Economy Secretary Keith Brown has written to UK ministers calling for protection of the Scotch whisky industry. The industry is worth about Â£4bn to Scotland in exports. An EU definition of whisky currently protects sales from sub-standard products. The UK government said it would support the industry so it continued to thrive. Mr Brown's call follows International Trade Secretary Liam Fox's visit to the US last week. The economy secretary said: ""Aside from being a key part of Scottish culture and identity, our whisky industry supports around 20,000 jobs. ""The US made clear in the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership discussions that they would support a relaxation of the definition of whisky, which would open the market up to a number of products which do not currently meet that standard."" He added: ""It is vital that we continue to have robust legal protection of Scotch whisky, which is why I have sought clarification from the UK government as to whether Scotch whisky featured in discussions during last week's trade visit by the Secretary of State for International Trade. ""I am also demanding that the current EU regulations are guaranteed post-Brexit. ""After reports this week that the UK government is contemplating trade deals that threaten the value and reputation of Scottish produce, once again we can see the confusion which is at the heart of the UK government's Brexit position. ""We need to be sure that any future deals work for Scotland and are not threatening the livelihoods of our farmers and producers."" He said all four UK governments should have oversight of the negotiations to ensure, as far as possible, ""that the right outcomes for everyone are secured"". A UK government spokeswoman said: ""Scotch is a UK export success story and we will support the industry so that it continues to thrive and prosper post-Brexit. ""The UK government has a strong relationship with the Scotch Whisky Association and is working closely with the industry as we aim to secure the best possible deal for the whole of the UK.""

'I wrote hits for Bieber and Sheeran but kept one for me',"Chances are, you've heard Julia Michaels' music whether you know it or not. The songs she's written for other artists, including Justin Bieber's Sorry, Ed Sheeran's Dive and Selena Gomez's Hands To Myself, have clocked up more than 8 billion streams worldwide. They're all songs that feel deeply personal - even when the artist doesn't get a writing credit. And that's Julia's secret: She persuades pop stars to open up and spill their guts like a packet of Cornflakes. For years, she was content working behind the scenes, until she wrote a song she just couldn't give away. Issues,external, released in January, is as catchy as it is tender - with Michaels rejecting pop's prevailing narrative of the strong, independent woman to admit her vulnerabilities. ""When I'm down, I get real down / When I'm high, I don't come down,"" she sings over a crisp, pizzicato backing. ""Yeah, I got issues... and one of them is how bad I need you."" The singer's second live performance was at the closing ceremony of the 2016 Olympics in Rio ""I'm content with saying I have jealousy problems,"" the 23-year-old tells the BBC. ""I'm emotional. Sometimes I cry, just because - and I don't think anybody should have to hide that side of themselves. ""If people aren't going to be accepting of that, they don't deserve to be around you."" Michaels has found plenty of people who've accepted it. Issues has been viewed on YouTube more than 134 million times, and her next single,Uh Huh,external, is already catching up. ""It's insane,"" she marvels. ""I never expected that."" The day after her debut UK performance - at last month'sCapital Summertime Ball,external- the Iowa-born singer chatted to the BBC about going solo; her lonely childhood; and having ""eureka moments"" in the studio. Your real name is Julia Cavassos - why choose Julia Michaels as a stage name? My dad is Puerto Rican and when he moved to LA to be an actor, he was advised to change his last name to something more American, so he could go up for roles that were Italian, for example - because a lot of times they see the names before they see the photos. So of course he picked the most American name he could find: My dad was born Juan Manuel Cavassos and he changed it to John Michaels. When I was a kid, my mom tried to get me to act, too, so we just took my dad's stage name and I've had it ever since. Did you get any parts? No, that was definitely not on my cards. Writing was the thing I always wanted to do. The star has written her biggest hits with British composer Justin Tranter When did you realise you were good at writing? I've written for as long as I can remember but I guess it was when I won a poetry contest in fourth grade. What was the poem? I think it was something about love - and of course when you're in fourth grade you have no idea what that means. But I've always loved words. Growing up, it was my way of feeling less alone. Why did you feel that? My parents divorced when I was quite young and I wasn't super close to my siblingsandI was kind of an awkward kid. So I always felt like words were kind of my best friend. That was my way of getting my emotions out. Were you an avid reader? No, it's funny. I've never been much of a reader. I can read poetry but I can't read books. I don't know if it's my attention span, or if it's because I equate it to songwriting. When you write songs, you have to create an impression in three minutes; and that impression has to be fun or heartbreaking or something super messed up. It's the same with poetry. You have, like, 15 lines and there's your sentiment. Boom, it just hits you. So you're not reading Beowulf, then? No, no, no! The singer says she has a ""ready-made"" fanbase, after Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez fans sought her out on social media When you're writing a lyric, how much editing and redrafting do you do? I kind of self-edit as I go. I'm not the kind of person to write a song then revisit it a week later. Usually, if it doesn't feel right we fix it in the moment. There's a line in the Selena Gomez songHands To Myself,externalthat's been called one of the best pop lyrics of recent times - but she told me you improvised it. Is that true? I tend to do a lot of things spontaneously, just singing into the mic. So I was doing the bridge - ""can't keep my hands to myself"" - and when we stopped, I said, ""wait, guys, I have an idea. It could be really dumb but let's roll with it"". And then I just sang, ""I mean I could - but why would I want to"" and they just went, ""Ooooooh!"" Sometimes it just pops into your head. Like a little light bulb going off. You said ""this might be dumb"" - but I guess it's important to be vulnerable in the studio... Shelly Peiken, who's a really incredible songwriter, used to say ""dare to suck"". You never know what people's reactions are going to be, so you've got to take chances. Michaels is still writing for other projects, including Selena Gomez's forthcoming album What made you want to step into the limelight and sing your own songs? It was when I wrote Issues. I'd always written personal songs, but this one was very, very personal. I'd had a fight with my boyfriend - who's my ex-boyfriend now, we broke up last week. Anyway, we'd gotten in a stupid fight and I wrote the song that day, and there were a couple of artists that really wanted to sing it. But because I'd written about me and him so specifically, in that relationship, I just felt uncomfortable having somebody else sing something so personal. So that was the point where I emailed Charlie Walk (head of Republic Records) and said, ""I think I'm ready to do this"". So people had been asking before? Oh yeah. And I was like, ""No, guys, stop! I'm a songwriter. Leave me alone!"" Was it hard to move from singing backing vocals to being the lead? No. I've sung every template vocal of every song I've written, so I'm used to performing it the way the artist would sing it. So that's never been a problem for me. Issues is about having strength in vulnerability. Why did you choose that message for your first single? I feel like nowadays, women feel like they have to suppress their emotions because they don't want to be the stereotype ""emotional girl"". There's nothing more annoying than a guy saying, ""You're too sensitive"". I hate that. Not everybody is unicorns and rainbows all the time. And if people can't stick around for the hardship then, no, they don't deserve to be around you. But the song's not just for women. Men suppress their emotions all the time and it's really sad because there's so much power in being OK with who you are. The singer's second ever live performance was at the closing ceremony of the 2016 Olympics Uh-Huh is perhaps more straightforward, in that it's about fancying the pants off someone. Definitely. That song came from an experience I had with somebody, where I really wanted him to make the move. Like, desperate for it. And we were both so nervous. So what happened with this guy? Did one of you make the move? It's still pending! You've got to ask him out, now that you've confessed everything in a song! I know. I know! I totally do. You're about to release your first EP. What can we expect? Well, I tend to only know two sides of myself at this moment, as a 23-year-old woman. I know my emotional side, and I know my playful, more sexual side. And because I know those things, those are the things I tend to write about. So a lot of it is going to be touching on those situations and, in lieu of recent events, there will be a lot of heartbreak situations. So you're replacing some of the songs right now? Yes. There is no silver lining to a breakup but the writing. But wait - doesn't that mean you can ask the other guy out now? Yes! Yes I can!

Facebook chief Sandberg: 'Pay women well',"Fairer pay for women must be backed up by stronger policies at work, according to Facebook's Sheryl Sandberg. But the firm's chief operating officer, in an interview forBBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, said the first step is to ""start paying women well"". She chose Beyonce's empowering Run The World (Girls) as her first song. She said: ""We start telling little girls not to lead at a really young age and we start to tell boys [to] lead at a very young age. That is a mistake."" ""I believe everyone has inside them the ability to lead and we should let people choose that not based on their gender but on who they are and who they want to be."" In an emotional interview, Ms Sandberg also spoke of the sudden death of her husband in 2015 and the effect on her two young children. ""I didn't know anyone could cry this much,"" she said. Facebook's Sandberg in Mother's Day plea Sheryl Sandberg- The trade-offs of professional life How long should bereavement leave last? BBC report reveals gender pay divide Ms Sandberg made headlines in 2013 with her book ""Lean in"" about female empowerment in the workplace. It became a worldwide bestseller, but was criticised by some for being elitist and unrealistic for many women not in her privileged position. In the interview, she also called for more to be done around the gender pay gap between men and women. Ms Sandberg admitted she had struggled with self-doubt at Harvard and recognised that women more than men underestimated their own worth, preventing them from putting themselves forward or asking for a pay rise. ""We need to start paying women well and we need the public and the corporate policy to get there,"" she said. ""Certainly, women applying for jobs at the same rate as men, women running for office at the same rate as men, that has got to be part of the answer."" Following the sudden death of her husband Dave Goldberg, Ms Sandberg described herself a ""different"" person now. She found him on the floor of a gym with a head injury after he had suffered a heart attack whilst they were on a weekend away. Sometimes tearful, she said: ""I'm sadder. I didn't know anyone could cry this much. I asked my sister - she is a doctor - and she said the majority of your body is water,"" she joked. This video can not be played 'I felt like I had stepped into a void, like I could barely breathe' - Sheryl Sandberg She chose One by U2 as the record she would keep if the other seven were washed away because Mr Goldberg had loved the band, adding that music had been incredibly important to them both - her husband was the founder of online music site, Launch Media. Another of her eight tracks was Queen's You're My Best Friend in tribute to her group of close female friends whom she said helped support her through the ordeal. Since his death, Ms Sandberg said she had become more empathetic and, at Facebook, doubled the amount of time Facebook employees can take off when an immediate family member dies to 20 days. She said it was also important to support people and build their confidence if they wanted to come into work. ""I offer people time off, I say can we take that project off you, but when they want to be at work, let them. ""Sometimes for me, the memories of Dave are everywhere, but they are worse at home by far, so for me getting out of the house and having something else to do that was a lifeline. ""I have heard that from many people who have lost a spouse and children."" She said it was impossible to look ahead 10 years, but she wanted her husband's legacy to be one of ""life, hope and joy"". When asked about her meeting with the Home Secretary Amber Rudd to discuss what Facebook was doing to fight terrorism, she said they were ""aligned"" in their aims. ""Complicated conversations"" with governments about encrypted messages on WhatsApp, the social messaging platform that Facebook owns, were also continuing, she said. Following the Westminster terror attack on 22 March, Ms Rudd wanted the police to have access to encrypted WhatsApp messages that suspects had sent each other. Ms Sandberg's chosen book was the science fantasy novel ""A Wrinkle in Time"" written by American writer Madeleine L'Engle, because she said it was a triumph of ""light against darkness,"" and her luxury was a journal.
