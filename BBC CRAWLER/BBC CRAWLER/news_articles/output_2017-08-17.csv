Barcelona attack kills 13 in tourist spot,"This video can not be played Eyewitness tells the BBC: ""Families were screaming for their kids"" Thirteen people died and dozens were injured when a van ploughed into crowds in Barcelona's famous Las Ramblas area, Catalan police and local officials say. The rented vehicle sped along the pedestrian area that is popular with tourists, mowing down people and sending others fleeing for cover. Spain's Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said it was a ""jihadist attack"". Two people have been arrested, but police say neither was the driver, who fled on foot. Early on Friday morning, Catalan police said an operation was taking place in town of Cambrils, to the south-west of Barcelona, in response to a ""possible terrorist attack"" and have told people there to stay indoors. The authorities also say an explosion on Wednesday evening at a house outside Barcelona that left one person dead was connected to the Las Ramblas attack. Dozens of gas cylinders were found at the house in the town of Alcanar, about 100km (60 miles) south west of Barcelona, and Reuters quoted a police source as saying residents were preparing explosives. In another incident, police shot dead a man who drove into officers at a checkpoint on the outskirts of Barcelona, but the authorities said there was no evidence that he was connected to the attack in Las Ramblas. Live updates What we know so far Aftermath in pictures Police have released a photo of a man named as Driss Oukabir, whose documents were used to rent the van involved in the attack. Local media say he is in his 20s, and was born in Morocco. However, latest reports suggest he has told police he was not involved, and that his documents were stolen. Police released this photo of Driss Oukabir, whose documents were used to rent the van So-called Islamic State has said it was behind the van attack in Las Ramblas, saying in a brief statement carried by its Amaq news agency that it was carried out by ""Islamic State soldiers"". The group gave no further evidence or details to back this claim. The attack happened at the height of the season in one of Europe's top tourist destinations. Witnesses said the van deliberately targeted people, weaving from side to side as it drove down the boulevard. Vehicles have been used to ram into crowds in a series of attacks across Europe since July last year. Gordon Corera, BBC News security correspondent Barcelona is just the latest European city to witness the terrible effects of a vehicle attack on an iconic or ""soft"" target. In Nice a year ago, Bastille Day celebrations were targeted, then a Christmas market in Berlin. In London, Westminster and London Bridge, as well as Finsbury Park, saw cars and vans used as weapons. In the UK, new barriers have been put in place to mitigate some of the risks at key locations and there is discussion of imposing checks on those renting vans, but security services in Britain - as well as across Europe - are all too aware that there are limits to what they can do to spot and stop those planning murder in this way. The weapons employed are readily available and there is little or no training, co-ordination or planning required. This means there are  few points where individuals can be spotted by the intelligence services. Although so-called Islamic State has released a statement saying what it calls its ""soldiers"" had carried out the Barcelona attack, it is not yet clear whether there was any direct link to the group or if they were simply inspired by its call to act. The language used often indicates the latter. Either way, authorities will be bracing themselves for the possibility of further attacks of a similar nature. A businessman from New Orleans, who was just arriving in a taxi in Las Ramblas, said: ""I heard a crowd screaming. It sounded like they were screaming for a movie star. ""I saw the van. It had already been busted on the front. It was weaving left and right, trying to hit people as fast as possible. There were people lying on the ground."" This video can not be played Footage shows police surrounding a white van moments after the attack Aamer Anwar said he was walking down Las Ramblas, which was ""jam-packed"" with tourists. ""All of a sudden, I just sort of heard a crashing noise and the whole street just started to run, screaming. I saw a woman right next to me screaming for her kids,"" he told Sky News. ""Police were very, very quickly there, police officers with guns, batons, everywhere. Then the whole street started getting pushed back. ""Police officers who got there just started screaming at people to move back, move back."" This video can not be played Footage captures people using a shop as an escape route on Las Ramblas Kevin Kwast, who is on holiday in Barcelona with his family, said: ""I was eating with my family in La Boqueria market very near where the crash occurred. ""Hundreds of people started stampeding through the market... we started running with them going outside right into where casualties were already on the ground. ""Police pushed us into a money transfer shop and we've been sheltering there for over an hour."" Prime Minister Rajoy has travelled to Barcelona and declared three days of national mourning. ""Terrorists are defeated by unity,"" he said. Barcelona's mayor, Ada Colau, said the city would hold a minute of silence on Friday at midday. The United States has offered its assistance to Spain. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson also said consular assistance was being provided to Americans in the city, and urged US nationals to check in with their families. ""Terrorists around the world should know the United States and our allies are resolved to find you and bring you to justice,"" he told reporters. UK Prime Minister Theresa May saidher thoughts were with the victims, adding that ""the UK stands with Spain against terror"". French President Emmanuel Macron said: ""We remain united and determined.""

Barcelona attack: What we know so far,"A group of 12 jihadists has been blamed for a series of attacks in and around the Spanish city of Barcelona, killing 16 people. Four men have been arrested in connection with the attack. A van mowed down tourists and residents on Barcelona's famous Las Ramblas boulevard on 17 August. Then a car was driven into pedestrians in the popular seaside resort of Cambrils. For days, suspected Ramblas attacker Younes Abouyaaqoub was on the run before police shot him dead. At 16:50 (14:50 GMT) on 17 August a white van zig-zagged down Las Ramblas at high speed, while the pedestrian avenue - 1.2km (0.75 miles) long - was packed with tourists. Witnesses said the driver tried to hit as many people as possible. Many were knocked to the ground while others fled for cover in nearby shops and cafes. The driver killed 14 people and injured more than 100, then fled on foot. The speeding van left more than 100 casualties in its wake along Las Ramblas Catalan police and medics were quickly on the scene. The police described it as a terror attack and later said one man had carried it out. They named him as Younes Abouyaaqoub, 22. Eight hours later, a black Audi A3 car ploughed into pedestrians at Cambrils, 100km (62 miles) down the coast from Barcelona. A Spanish woman was killed. The Audi overturned and five people got out, some wearing fake suicide belts. Four were shot dead by a policeman at the scene. A fifth escaped but was later shot dead. Aftermath of Barcelona attack in pictures Spanish police stop second attack It has since become clear the attacks on Las Ramblas and at Cambrils were among several linked events that began the night before at Alcanar, further down the coast from Cambrils. Two of the suspected jihadists were killed in an explosion at a house there shortly after 23:00 on Wednesday night. One was imam Abdelbaki Es Satty, a Moroccan believed to have been the ringleader. The other was believed to be Youssef Aallaa. A third - Mohamed Houli Chemlal - was injured, and is among the arrested. He is being held by Spanish authorities on suspicion of terrorism-related offences. The blast destroyed the house. Police found 120 gas canisters in the wreckage and now believe the house was being used as a bomb factory and headquarters by the jihadists. Butane and propane gas canisters were found at the scene of an explosion in Alcanar Catalan police reckoned that the jihadists had been preparing bigger attacks, and that the accidental blast forced them to adopt a more rudimentary plan - the van rampage. Houli Chemlal confirmed that that was the case, judicial sources said. He told the Madrid court on 22 August that Barcelona's iconic Sagrada Familia church was among the targets, the sources said. All four suspects have reportedly said the ringleader of the group was the imam, Abdelbaki Es Satty. He and most of the suspects lived in Ripoll, a picturesque small town north of Barcelona. CCTV footage showed suspected Las Ramblas attacker Younes Abouyaaqoub leaving the scene of the van murders and walking through La Boqueria market. CCTV footage appears to show Abouyaaqoub fleeing the attack on foot Reports suggest he then headed to the city's university area where he hijacked a white Ford Focus car at knifepoint and killed the driver, Pau PÃ©rez. He then crashed through a police checkpoint, breaking a policewoman's leg, as he tried to leave Barcelona. The car was found abandoned a few kilometres to the south, at Sant Just Desvern, with the body of Mr PÃ©rez on the back seat. He had been stabbed - the 15th victim of the Barcelona and Cambrils attacks. Abouyaaqoub went on the run. On 21 August, police were tipped off by members of the public who had seen a man of his description in the rural Subirats area, 40km west of Barcelona. Police were on the scene and within minutes the suspect, wearing a fake explosives belt, had been shot dead. Younes Abouyaaqoub,the suspected van driver, born in Morocco. He was among the jihadists who lived in Ripoll, 100km north of Barcelona. Abouyaaqoub, 22, was on the run for four days until police shot him ImamAbdelbaki Es Satty,45, died in the Alcanar blast. He lived in a modest flat in Ripoll. Belgian officials say he spent three months living in Machelen, a suburb of Brussels, before the March 2016 suicide bombings that killed 32 people in the Belgian capital. In 2010-2014 he was in jail in eastern Spain for drug trafficking, police said. Satty was described by locals in Ripoll as a reclusive, devout Muslim who was close to the Moroccan youths. The father of two of the Cambrils attackers has accused him of radicalising them. This video can not be played Inside the pretty town hiding terror suspects Driss Oukabir,28, is among the men charged in relation to the attack. He denied being in the jihadist cell but admitted having hired two vans, one of which was used in the Barcelona attack. He said he hired them thinking his friends would use them for a house move. Police found his passport in the Barcelona van - he claimed that his brotherMoussa Oukabir, 17, had stolen his ID. The younger brother was among the five killed by police in Cambrils. The other van was later found in the town of Vic and believed to be a getaway vehicle. An image of Moussa Oukabir, circulated in Spanish press and taken from social media Driss turned himself in in Ripoll on 17 August, with a judge ordering him detained on suspicion of terrorism-related offences on 22 August. The Oukabir brothers had Moroccan as well as Spanish nationality. The other four attackers killed at Cambrils wereSaid Aallaa,18; Mohamed Hychami,24; Omar HychamiandHoussaine Abouyaaqoub. Said Aallaa is said to have left a note in his room apologising for the harm he was about to cause. Two other men were detained in Ripoll -Salah el-Karib, 34, andMohammed Aallaa, 27. The latter is believed to be the owner of Audi car used by the jihadists in Cambrils. He has been released on conditional bail as there is not enough evidence to hold him, court papers revealed. A judge ordered el-Karib to be held for a further 72 hours to allow investigators more time. French police say the Audi was driven to Paris by Younes Abouyaaqoub and another jihadist on a short weekend trip before the Barcelona attack. Their motive for that is not clear, but they are known to have gone shopping. More details of the Barcelona suspects They come from all over the world, with at least 34 nationalities represented. People from Ireland, the UK, France, Australia, Pakistan, Venezuela, Algeria, Peru, Germany, the Netherlands, Greece, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Ecuador, the US, Argentina, Romania, Cuba, Austria and the Philippines are all reported to be among those hurt.

A three-year-old relative with him also died Italian Bruno Gulotta, 35 Italian Luca Russo, 25 British-Australian national Julian Cadman, 7 Spaniard Ana MarÃ­a SuÃ¡rez. Died in the Cambrils attack Pau PÃ©rez, 34, found fatally stabbed in car at Sant Just Desvern Two Portuguese nationals are also confirmed dead, a woman aged 74 and her 20-year-old granddaughter. An unnamed German woman, 51, died in hospital on 27 August. Jared Tucker, a father-of-three,was on honeymoonwith his wife of one year, Heidi Nunes, when he died, his father said. Mr Tucker had been enjoying drinks on Las Ramblas when the van struck him. Ian Moore Wilson was the father of a Vancouver police officer. His wife, Valerie, was injured. The mother of Julian Cadman, the seven year old killed on Las Ramblas, was also injured in the attack and is in a serious but stable condition in hospital. So-called Islamic State (IS) has said it was behind both the Las Ramblas and Cambrils attacks and that IS ""soldiers"" carried them out. But it did not provide any evidence or details to back up the claim. Spain is one of Europe's most popular tourist destinations, but in recent years has not seen the kind of jihadist violence that has rocked France, the UK, Belgium and Germany. Spain's long anti-terror experience Still, Spain has been targeted before - several trains in Madrid, the capital, were bombed by al-Qaeda inspired militants in 2004, killing 191 people and injuring hundreds of others. It remains Europe's bloodiest terror attack this century. This video can not be played What was it like to be caught up in the Barcelona attack? IS news outlet Amaq said the attack was carried out as part of efforts to target states fighting in the US-led anti-IS coalition. A few hundred Spanish soldiers are in Iraq, training local forces fighting IS. The number of operations carried out against jihadists in the country has increased significantly since Spain raised its terror alert level to four out of five in June 2015, meaning there was a ""high risk"" of a terror attack. Security was stepped up in the wake of truck attacks in the French city of Nice in July 2016 and the German capital Berlin in December. On Twitter, the Spanish royal household posted: ""They are murderers, nothing more than criminals who are not going to terrorise us. All of Spain is Barcelona.""

Calories in popular foods 'must be cut',"Targets are to be set to reduce calories in pizzas, burgers and ready meals as part of the government's drive to tackle child obesity in England. Health officials believe the move is needed as people are consuming 200 to 300 calories too many each day. It could see the size of products reduced or ingredients changed in food and drinks bought in supermarkets, takeaways and restaurants. The targets are expected to be set by Public Health England within a year. They will be voluntary, although officials at the government advisory body said if the industry did not respond they were prepared to legislate. 260 in a typical burger with cheese in a bun 880 in a 10-inch takeaway pizza 237 in a Krispy Kreme chocolate iced ring doughnut 338 in a Greggs tuna mayonnaise white sub roll 244 in a 400g tin of Heinz spaghetti The calorie-reduction programme comes after the success of the decade-long drive to reduce salt content in food. It will be modelled on the sugar-reduction programme that was included in last year's child obesity strategy and which committed the industry to reducing the amount of sugar in certain foods by 20% by 2020. PHE chief nutritionist Dr Alison Tedstone said good progress was being made on the sugar target and it was now time to consider tackling calories. She pointed out that only a quarter of calories come from sugary foods so if successful it could have a major impact. ""We have a serious problem - one in three leave primary school either obese or overweight,"" she said. ""If we want to tackle this we have to look at calories. There are a number of ways it can be done - we can reduce the size of the products or change the ingredients."" As a guide, an average man needs around 2,500 calories a day to maintain a healthy body weight For an average woman, that figure is around 2,000 These values can vary depending on age, size and levels of physical activity, among other factors School-age children are advised to consume anywhere between 1,600 and 2,500 People on average consume between 200 and 300 calories more than they should Source:NHS Choices,external She also defended the child obesity strategy, which was announced last August, amid criticism from campaigners that it had failed to have the impact it should have. Dr Tedstone said she was ""delighted"" with it as it was the first time there had been a cross-government commitment to tackling the issue. The plan also included the levy on sugary drinks, which is due to come into force in April 2018. Caroline Cerny, of the Obesity Health Alliance, said it looked forward to seeing ""ambitious"" targets being set to cut calories. But she said the food industry was continuing to ""get away with bombarding children with adverts that we know encourage unhealthy food choices"". ""Failing to tackle this area is significantly undermining the impact of the child obesity plan.  After one year, it is scraping along with a C grade, rather than topping the class with an A star,"" she added. A spokeswoman for the Food and Drink Federation said it welcomed ""broadening"" the focus away from only sugar. ""Singling out the role of individual ingredients and food groups does not help consumers to make good choices about their diet, lifestyle or general health."" She said companies were playing their part by making healthier options available and providing nutritional information on packs. She added: ""Our industry has a proud track record of reformulation to remove salt, fat and sugar from food and drinks.  This work will continue as we rise to the challenge of PHE's sugar reduction targets and engage with this new focus on calories.""

Brother of model kidnap suspect in court,"Lukasz Herba, left, and his brother Michal are suspects in the alleged kidnap The brother of the alleged captor of British model Chloe Ayling is to fight extradition to Italy, Westminster Magistrates' Court has heard. Michal Konrad Herba, 36, appeared in court for an extradition hearing following his arrest in Tividale, West Midlands, on Wednesday. He is the brother of Lukasz Pawel Herba who is being held by Italian police over the alleged kidnap in Milan. Michal Herba denies involvement. The case was adjourned until 25 September. Prosecutor Florence Iveson told the court that he was suspected of kidnapping and unlawfully detaining Ms Ayling in a ""joint enterprise"" with his brother and other ""unidentified persons"". The 20-year-old model was allegedly drugged and a ransom of â¬300,000 (Â£270,000) was demanded, the court heard. Defence lawyer Katherine Newbey said ""no evidence had been served in the case"" and her client ""denies involvement"". This video can not be played Chloe Ayling: ""I've been through a terrifying experience"" Mr Herba did not consent to extradition, meaning that a full hearing will have to take place. Deputy Senior District Judge Tan Ikram remanded the suspect in custody, saying he was satisfied there were ""substantial grounds"" to believe he would fail to surrender if he was released. Mr Herba is due to appear in the same court by video link for a bail application on 23 August. A full extradition hearing has been scheduled for 25 September. Ms Ayling, from Coulsdon, south London, arrived in Milan on 10 July for a photo shoot. Italian police say she was attacked by two men, drugged with ketamine and abducted, apparently to be sold in an online auction. She is believed to have been transported in a bag to an isolated village near Turin, Italy, but was released on 17 July. Ms Ayling's lawyer Francesco Pesce has said she was told she would be sold in the Middle East ""for sex"". Mr Herba (right) is due back before magistrates next week Speaking after the alleged abduction, Ms Ayling said she feared for her life throughout the ""terrifying experience"". ""I'm incredibly grateful to the Italian and UK authorities for all they have done to secure my safe release,"" she said. Italian police documents claim that suspect Lukasz Herba said he had got involvedin order to raise money for cancer treatment. The Polish national, who lives in Oldbury in the West Midlands, told investigators he drove her to the British consulate in Milan and released her before the sale went ahead.

Trump defends 'beautiful' war statues,"Civil War statues have prompted protests for many years US President Donald Trump has denounced the removal of ""beautiful"" Confederate statues amid a heated national debate about US race relations. ""Sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments,"" he tweeted. ""You can't change history, but you can learn from it,"" he continued. Mr Trump drew outrage by defending organisers of a white supremacist rally that left a woman dead and dozens hurt. The rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, supported by neo-Nazis and white supremacists, was in protest of the removal of a statue of Robert E Lee, a general who had fought for the pro-slavery Confederacy during the US Civil War. It turned deadly when a driver ploughed into a crowd of counter protesters, inflicting fatal injuries on Heather Heyer. Why the fuss over Confederate statues? America - diminished and dismissed ""Robert E Lee, Stonewall Jackson - who's next, Washington, Jefferson? So foolish!""Mr Trump continued in a series of tweets,externalon Thursday. This video can not be played Racism in the US: Is there a single step that can bring equality? ""The beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced!"" The recent removal of controversial statues, including some to leaders of the pro-slavery rebellion defeated in the US Civil War, has been the latest flashpoint in racial tensions across the country. Critics say monuments to the Confederacy are racially offensive, but supporters say they are important symbols preserving Southern heritage. Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington Donald Trump's condemnation of white supremacists on Monday increasingly feels like the guy in the bar who starts his diatribes with ""I'm not a racist, butâ¦"". While the president has felt compelled to distance himself from the hate and bigotry that many of the marchers last weekend spewed, he has come down with both feet in support of the cause for which they were supposedly rallying. This may not be as surprising a strategy as it first seems, however. Recent polls show the American public is generally against removing the statues scattered across states of the old Confederacy. As Steve Bannon said in his surprisingly blunt interview with the American Prospect magazine on Thursday, drawing liberals into a contentious debate about ""race and identity"" allows Mr Trump and his supporters to become champions of economic nationalism. After a tumultuous several weeks, the president is trying to find his footing. While it might seem jarring for the president who boasts that Republicans are ""the party of Abraham Lincoln"" to speak warmly of ""beautiful"" statues of Robert E Lee, it wouldn't be the first time intellectual coherence has taken a back seat to political expediency. Read Anthony's take Follow@awzurcher,external Maine's Governor Paul LePage, a Republican, said on Thursday taking down Confederate statues is ""just like"" removing a monument to the victims of the 9/11 attacks. But relatives of Stonewall Jackson, a Confederate leader Mr Trump mentioned in his Thursday tweets,wrote an open letter,externalto the mayor of Richmond, Virginia, urging him to remove the statue of their great-great-grandfather and all other Confederate statues in town. Jack and Warren Christian, Mr Jackson's great-great-sons, said removing the statues would ""further difficult conversations about racial justice"". This video can not be played New Orleans mayor on why Confederate monuments have to go ""While we are not ashamed of our great-great-grandfather, we are ashamed to benefit from white supremacy while our black family and friends suffer,"" the pair wrote. ""We are ashamed of the monument."" Robert E Lee V, the great-great-grandson of the famous Confederate general, issued a statement condemning the violence in the wake of the statue removals. When is it right to remove a statue? Trump adviser Steve Bannon dubs white nationalists 'clowns' ""While the debate about how we memorialise figures from our past continues, we the descendants of Robert E Lee decry in the strongest terms the misuse of his memory by those advancing a message of intolerance and hate,"" he said in a statement to the BBC. ""He never would have tolerated the hateful words and violent actions of white supremacists, the KKK, or Neo Nazis."" The president's comments came after a week of turmoil over his response to the violent clashes in the small Virginia town. Mr Trump was criticised for blaming both sides for the violence, but belatedly condemned the white supremacist and neo-Nazi groups on Monday. This video can not be played Candlelit vigil held in Charlottesville During a heated news conference on Tuesday he backtracked and again blamed left-wing counter-protesters for the incident, too. Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, the only black Republican in the upper chamber, said inan interview with Vice News,externalthat the president's ""moral authority"" had been ""compromised"". ""I'm not going to defend the indefensibleâ¦ [Mr Trump's] comments on Monday were strong. His comments on Tuesday started erasing the comments that were strong,"" Senator Scott said. ""What we want to see from our president is clarity and moral authority. And that moral authority is compromised."" Amid the fallout over the president's response, corporate leaders and CEOs began resigning from two White House business councils.

Drummer left in supermarket car park,"Belle and Sebastian are currently touring North America The drummer with indie group Belle and Sebastian has been reunited with his band after accidentally being left behind at a US supermarket car park. Richard Colburn waited in vain in his pyjamas for four hours for the bus to return after the unscheduled stop at a Walmart in North Dakota. His bandmates discovered he was gone only after driving 500 miles. The band, who formed in Glasgow in 1996, are currently touring North America. The band had been travelling from Missoula in Montana to a gig in St Paul in Minnesota when they made a late-night stop at Walmart in the town of Dickinson on Tuesday. Richard Colburn waited for four hours at Walmart for the bus to return Singer Stuart Murdoch told Minneapolis radio show The Current that the band had stopped to buy water before taking to their bunks for the night. He said: ""I was coming out the Walmart and he was coming into the Walmart and he was waving very happily in a good mood and that was the last time that we saw him."" Murdoch said the band returned to the bus oblivious that the drummer was still inside the store. He said: ""He was probably thinking that someone was going to notice but the trouble is that everyone went to bed."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Stuart Murdoch said that it was only hours later, when the band had long since crossed the state line, that they realised Colburn was missing. He said: ""There used to be a system, but because we all have mobile phones these days, everybody's got a little bit blasÃ©. ""It used to be that you would leave a pass on the passenger seat for the last person and that's how the driver knew. ""Richard didn't have his phone with him."" After waiting in the car park for four hours, Colburn used his credit card to check into a hotel. Inspired by an episode of the West Wing, Murdoch said his instinct was to get the word out that Colburn had gone missing. Colburn spent four hours waiting at Walmart in Dickinson, North Dakota He tweeted asking for help to get the drummer to their next show, telling fans that the gig was ""hanging in the balance"". He said: ""We didn't know how we were going to get him from that desolate spot to St Paul, so we tweeted and lots of kind people tweeted me back saying 'I'm in Fargo, maybe I could get there, I'm in Bismarck, maybe we could work something out'. I even had a friend who was driving down from Winnipeg on the way to the show here. ""So currently we have him in a car driving to Bismarck and the only question is will they let him on the plane with no ID and in his pyjamas."" Murdoch joked that one former manager had suggested that organising the band's eight members was like ""herding cats"" and had suggested 15 years ago that they all be microchipped. The band have since posted to say that Colburn was now ""safely back in the fold"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Poland storms topple thousands of trees,"This video can not be played Aerial footage shows the destruction Tens of thousands of trees have been brought down by storms that wreaked havoc across northern and western Poland, the forestry service says. The storms over the weekend killed six people, including two Girl Guides who were crushed by a falling tree. Thousands of homes were also damaged. Poland's chief forester Konrad Tomaszewski said it would take up to two years to clear the fallen trees, and decades for the lost natural habitat to recover. He called it ""undoubtedly the worst disaster in the history of Polish - and perhaps even European - forestry"". Much of the damage occurred overnight between Friday and Saturday It is estimated the storms brought down over eight million cubic metres of lumber across 45,000 hectares of forest. Some of the hardest hit areas were Torun, Gdansk, and Poznan - all in the northern and western parts of the country. Tens of thousands of trees were felled in the storms In Torun alone, the storms left more than 23,000 hectares of damaged forest. It also destroyed the habitats of rare species. In astatement,external(in Polish), Polish State Forests said they found ""destroyed bird nests"" and ""dead animals that failed to escape the storm."" A map released by Polish State Forests shows the worst-hit areas in the north and west The disaster comes as the Polish government faces criticism for logging in Europe's oldest forest, which is situated in the east of the country. The Bialowieza forest is a Unesco world heritage site that sits along Poland's border with Belarus, and is home to rare wildlife. Unesco, EU officials, and green activists have all opposed logging there and last month the European Union's top court ordered that large-scale logging operations be immediately stopped. Logging banned in Europe's oldest forest The Polish government responded by saying logging was necessary to protect the forest from an infestation of bark beetle. The European Court of Justice will meet in a few months to determine whether the injunction will remain in place. The European Commission is taking legal action against Warsaw, and if Poland loses the case it will be liable for multimillion euro fines.

Speaking as students across the country received their exam results, her mother Lesley said: ""It made her very happy - the thought that she was off to uni to do what she loved. ""She was so excited about it because she'd wanted to do that since she was about 11. ""It is obviously sad for us because we were so excited for her when she got the news that she was off to uni, but we are just so proud of what she achieved.""

Trump pushes debunked 'pig's blood' myth,"General Pershing later led US forces in World War One US President Donald Trump has invoked a debunked myth about a general who fought Islamist militants by using pig's blood to commit mass executions. The president's tweet came hours after a driver crashed a van into a crowd of people in Barcelona, leaving many dead or injured. ""Study what General Pershing... did to terrorists when caught,"" Mr Trump said, referring to the discredited story. Historians and fact checkerssay there is no truth,externalto it. The myth, which has circulated online, refers to General John Pershing's actions during the US war in the Philippines in the early 1900s. He is said to have rounded up 50 terrorists and then ordered his men to shoot 49 of them, using bullets dipped in pig's blood. The survivor was told to go back and tell his people what happened. Pigs are considered ritually unclean in Islam, and in his tweet the president said the general's actions acted as a deterrent to further acts of terror. His comments came shortly after more than a dozen people were killed on Thursday in the Las Ramblas area of Barcelona. Police say it was clearly a terrorist attack and they have arrested two people but not yet located the driver.

Trump 'scraps infrastructure council plan',"Donald Trump talked about expediting infrastructure projects earlier this week President Trump is dropping plans to create an advisory group on infrastructure, a day after two other business panels were dissolved. The president has faced a backlash from business leaders over his remarks this week on white supremacists. A White House official said the infrastructure council, which was still being formed, ""will not move forward"". Mr Trump signed an executive order last month to create the group as he looks to spend $1 trillion on infrastructure. He has made updating US roads, bridges and airports a key part of his legislative agenda. However, on Wednesday he was forced to disband two other White House business panels amid an exodus of chief executives. Business leaders quit over Mr Trump's response to a far-right rally in Virginia, which left a woman dead and dozens hurt. Business mutiny leaves Trump isolated America - diminished and dismissed The rally, supported by neo-Nazis and white supremacists, was in protest of the removal of a statue of Robert E Lee, a general who had fought for the pro-slavery Confederacy during the US Civil War. On Thursday, Mr Trump re-opened the heated debate by denouncing the removal of ""beautiful"" Confederate statues. Apple boss Tim Cook joined the condemnation of Mr Trump The decision to drop his infrastructure panel comes as the bosses of some of the biggest US companies have criticised Mr Trump's handling of far-right groups. On Monday, Mr Trump belatedly condemned the white supremacist and neo-Nazi groups that rallied in Charlottesville, Virginia, on Sunday. But in a rancorous news conference on Tuesday he backtracked and again blamed left-wing counter-protesters for the violence too. That prompted business leaders to quit his manufacturing and policy councils, and drew criticism from the bosses of firms including Apple and JP Morgan. Mr Trump had originally planned to draw members of the Advisory Council on Infrastructure from real estate, construction and other parts of the economy. At the start of the year he said he was planning the panel and named two well known New York property developers to lead it. Representatives for the developers, Steve Roth of Vornado Realty Trust and Richard LeFrak of LeFrak, could not be reached immediately.

'Breakthrough' in treating peanut allergy,"An oral treatment for peanut allergy is still effective four years after it was administered, a study has found. Children were given a probiotic, with a peanut protein, daily for 18 months. When tested one month later, 80% could tolerate peanuts without any allergic symptoms and after four years, 70% of them were still able to eat peanuts without suffering any side-effects. Food allergies have risen dramatically in recent decades, with peanut allergy one of the most deadly. Lead researcher Prof Mimi Tang, of Murdoch Childrens Research Institute in Melbourne, said half the children were consuming peanuts regularly while others were only eating them infrequently. ""The importance of this finding is that these children were able to eat peanuts like children who don't have peanut allergy and still maintain their tolerant state, protected against reactions to peanuts,"" she said. Prof Tang said it was the first time a treatment for peanut allergy had been shown to be effective for this long. The probiotic used is calledLactobacillus rhamnosus,which has been associated with preventing certain allergic symptoms. There is often confusion about when peanuts are safe as the guidelines used to advocate avoidance Peanuts are now thought to besafe in pregnancy,external If there is no family history of allergies or eczema then health officials say peanut butter and other ground or crushed nuts are OKafter six months,external If there is a heightened risk then parents should consult a doctor This research suggests careful introduction of peanut may help such children, but parents should not do this on their own No child under five should eat a whole nut The Australian research team now wants to assess whether the treatment has improved the children's quality of life, as some 250 million people worldwide are affected by food allergy - a number which has more than trebled in the last 20 years. Peanut allergy, which is one of the most common causes of death from food allergy, has increased at the greatest rate. Prof Tang said the findings, published inThe Lancet Child & Adolescent Health,,externalsuggest ""the exciting possibility that tolerance is a realistic target for treating food allergy"". She added: ""This is a major step forward in identifying an effective treatment to address the food allergy problem in Western societies.""

Brakes 'would have made no difference',"Charlie Alliston denies manslaughter and causing bodily harm by wanton or furious driving A cyclist accused of killing a woman by ploughing into her on his racing bike has told a court that having a front brake ""would have made no difference"". Charlie Alliston, then aged 18, was allegedly going at 18mph when he hit Kim Briggs as she crossed Old Street in Shoreditch, London, in February 2016. Mr Alliston, who denies manslaughter, was riding a fixed wheel track bike with no front brake at the time. The crash could have been avoided if one had been fitted, prosecutors say. Mrs Briggs, a 44-year-old HR consultant, suffered ""catastrophic"" head injuries and later died in hospital, the trial at the Old Bailey has heard. Mr Alliston, who is now 20, is said to have shouted at the mother of two as she lay mortally injured, later blaming her for the collision in posts he made online. Kim Briggs was knocked over in east London in February of last year He told the court he had had no idea there was a legal requirement for his bike to have a front brake. ""I tried to go around,"" said Mr Alliston, who alleges Mrs Briggs was using a mobile phone at the time of the collision. ""Having a brake, I wouldn't have had enough time to pull it,"" he said. ""It was a few split seconds prior to the impact, which caused the impact, so a brake at the time wouldn't have made a difference."" The fixed wheel track bicycle ridden by Charlie Alliston did not have a front brake, jurors were told Jurors were told that Mr Alliston talked of removing his front brake from a previous bike in a tweet in February 2015, comparing the experience of riding it to being in a ""Lucas Brunelle movie"". The court heard that Brunelle is a stunt cyclist who makes videos in which he rides around cities including London ""doing dangerous stuff"" such as weaving in and out of traffic. But Mr Alliston denied copying the filmmaker, or that he enjoyed taking risks. ""I wouldn't say I drove recklessly or at any time dangerously,"" the defendant said. ""At all times I would know what I'm doing and completely responsible for my actions."" He added: ""I did not get a kick or enjoyment out of not being safe."" Mr Alliston, from Bermondsey, is also accused of causing bodily harm to Mrs Briggs by ""wanton or furious driving"", under the 1861 Offences Against the Person Act. The trial continues.

Corbyn: Don't blame one group for abuse,"This video can not be played 'I don't think you can label a whole community,' the Labour leader said Jeremy Corbyn has said it is wrong to blame ""an entire ethnic community"" for child abuse after one of his frontbench team quit over a press article. Sarah Champion faced a backlash after writing in the Sun that ""Britain has a problem with British Pakistani men raping and exploiting white girls"". The Rotherham MP quit as shadow equalities minister and apologised for her ""extremely poor choice of words"". The Labour leader denied claims he had sacked Ms Champion for speaking out. He told BBC Manchester: ""Child exploitation is wrong. Child abuse is wrong. It is a crime, and it has to be dealt with. ""But you cannot blame an entire community, an entire nation or an entire ethnic community. You have to deal with it for the crime of what it is."" Asked if he had sacked Ms Champion over her comments, he said: ""Look, she resigned and I accepted the resignation, so, clearly, I think it's right thing to do and I thank her for her work."" Communities Secretary Sajid Javid accused Mr Corbyn of stifling debate. The Conservative minister said in a tweet: ""Corbyn wrong to sack Sarah Champion. We need an honest open debate on child sexual exploitation, including racial motivation."" Business Minister Margot James said she was ""enraged"" by the Labour leader's ""treatment of Sarah Champion"". She wrote on her Facebook page that the Rotherham MP's comments ""might have been hard hitting, but that doesn't make them any less true"". Sarah Champion quit the Labour front bench following an article in the Sun The Conservative MP for Stourbridge added: ""There needs to be a discussion about how we overcome the cultural attitudes towards women that have contributed to these crimes; and to the ways in which they were covered up for so long. ""There has been a disgraceful history of shouting down brave Labour women MPs who have stood up to community pressures in Northern cities like Keighley (just google former MP Ann Cryer) and Rotherham in exposing these crimes, of which the appalling treatment of Sarah Champion is yet another chapter."" Conservative former Children's Minister Tim Loughton said he did not know if Ms Champion had been sacked or not - but he accused Mr Corbyn of being ""deaf to a problem that is happening in our country"". The Equality and Human Rights Commission said it was a ""real shame"" that Ms Champion had resigned because of ""over-sensitivity about language"". Labour's shadow justice minister, Yasmin Qureshi, refused to be drawn on whether it was right that Ms Champion had stepped down. ""I think you need to ask Sarah that question,"" she toldBBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""Of course we should deal with abuse wherever it occurs and we should ask ourselves as to what we can do to ensure these things don't happen."" The online version of Ms Champion's article Ms Champion's article was written after 17 men were convicted of forcing girls in Newcastle to have sex. The men, who were mostly British-born, were of Iraqi, Bangladeshi, Pakistani, Indian, Iranian and Turkish heritage. In interviews following the convictions, the Labour MP said such crimes involved ""predominately Pakistani men"" and a fear of being called racist was hampering the authorities' investigations. She then wrote the Sun article, which also included the line: ""These people are predators, and the common denominator is their ethnic heritage."" Sajid Javid is calling for a debate Among the article's critics was fellow Labour MP Naz Shah, who said it was ""irresponsible"" and ""setting a dangerous precedent"". Following the backlash, Ms Champion sought to distance herself from the article, claiming it had been altered, something denied by the newspaper. Announcing she was stepping down, Ms Champion said: ""I apologise for the offence caused by the extremely poor choice of words in the Sun article on Friday. ""I am concerned that my continued position in the shadow cabinet would distract from the crucial issues around child protection which I have campaigned on my entire political career.

Trump defends âbeautifulâ war statues,"Civil War statues have prompted protests for many years US President Donald Trump has denounced the removal of ""beautiful"" Confederate statues amid a heated national debate about US race relations. ""Sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments,"" he tweeted. ""You can't change history, but you can learn from it,"" he continued. Mr Trump drew outrage by defending organisers of a white supremacist rally that left a woman dead and dozens hurt. The rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, supported by neo-Nazis and white supremacists, was in protest of the removal of a statue of Robert E Lee, a general who had fought for the pro-slavery Confederacy during the US Civil War. It turned deadly when a driver ploughed into a crowd of counter protesters, inflicting fatal injuries on Heather Heyer. Why the fuss over Confederate statues? America - diminished and dismissed ""Robert E Lee, Stonewall Jackson - who's next, Washington, Jefferson? So foolish!""Mr Trump continued in a series of tweets,externalon Thursday. This video can not be played Racism in the US: Is there a single step that can bring equality? ""The beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced!"" The recent removal of controversial statues, including some to leaders of the pro-slavery rebellion defeated in the US Civil War, has been the latest flashpoint in racial tensions across the country. Critics say monuments to the Confederacy are racially offensive, but supporters say they are important symbols preserving Southern heritage. Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington Donald Trump's condemnation of white supremacists on Monday increasingly feels like the guy in the bar who starts his diatribes with ""I'm not a racist, butâ¦"". While the president has felt compelled to distance himself from the hate and bigotry that many of the marchers last weekend spewed, he has come down with both feet in support of the cause for which they were supposedly rallying. This may not be as surprising a strategy as it first seems, however. Recent polls show the American public is generally against removing the statues scattered across states of the old Confederacy. As Steve Bannon said in his surprisingly blunt interview with the American Prospect magazine on Thursday, drawing liberals into a contentious debate about ""race and identity"" allows Mr Trump and his supporters to become champions of economic nationalism. After a tumultuous several weeks, the president is trying to find his footing. While it might seem jarring for the president who boasts that Republicans are ""the party of Abraham Lincoln"" to speak warmly of ""beautiful"" statues of Robert E Lee, it wouldn't be the first time intellectual coherence has taken a back seat to political expediency. Read Anthony's take Follow@awzurcher,external Maine's Governor Paul LePage, a Republican, said on Thursday taking down Confederate statues is ""just like"" removing a monument to the victims of the 9/11 attacks. But relatives of Stonewall Jackson, a Confederate leader Mr Trump mentioned in his Thursday tweets,wrote an open letter,externalto the mayor of Richmond, Virginia, urging him to remove the statue of their great-great-grandfather and all other Confederate statues in town. Jack and Warren Christian, Mr Jackson's great-great-sons, said removing the statues would ""further difficult conversations about racial justice"". This video can not be played New Orleans mayor on why Confederate monuments have to go ""While we are not ashamed of our great-great-grandfather, we are ashamed to benefit from white supremacy while our black family and friends suffer,"" the pair wrote. ""We are ashamed of the monument."" Robert E Lee V, the great-great-grandson of the famous Confederate general, issued a statement condemning the violence in the wake of the statue removals. When is it right to remove a statue? Trump adviser Steve Bannon dubs white nationalists 'clowns' ""While the debate about how we memorialise figures from our past continues, we the descendants of Robert E Lee decry in the strongest terms the misuse of his memory by those advancing a message of intolerance and hate,"" he said in a statement to the BBC. ""He never would have tolerated the hateful words and violent actions of white supremacists, the KKK, or Neo Nazis."" The president's comments came after a week of turmoil over his response to the violent clashes in the small Virginia town. Mr Trump was criticised for blaming both sides for the violence, but belatedly condemned the white supremacist and neo-Nazi groups on Monday. This video can not be played Candlelit vigil held in Charlottesville During a heated news conference on Tuesday he backtracked and again blamed left-wing counter-protesters for the incident, too. Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, the only black Republican in the upper chamber, said inan interview with Vice News,externalthat the president's ""moral authority"" had been ""compromised"". ""I'm not going to defend the indefensibleâ¦ [Mr Trump's] comments on Monday were strong. His comments on Tuesday started erasing the comments that were strong,"" Senator Scott said. ""What we want to see from our president is clarity and moral authority. And that moral authority is compromised."" Amid the fallout over the president's response, corporate leaders and CEOs began resigning from two White House business councils.

Boys help to raise A-level grades,"Boys results have overtaken girls in top grades in this year's A-levels Top A-level grades have increased for the first time in six years, as teenagers in England, Wales and Northern Ireland get their results. A* and A grades were awarded to 26.3% of entries - up by 0.5 percentage points compared with last year - with boys overtaking girls in top grades. There was a fall in the top grades for 13 subjects in England with new content and now assessed only by final exams. The number of university places allocated so far has dropped this year. In A* and A grades, boys have moved ahead of girls, with 26.6% of boys getting these results compared with 26.1% of girls, reversing a 0.3% gap last year. The change is significant because girls outperform boys at every stage of their education, and have been performing better at the top grades at A-levels for 17 years. There have been suggestions this could reflect the introduction of the new style of A-level exam. As results were being received, the Ucas admissions body said 416,000 university places had so far been confirmed - down 2% on the same point last year. University applications from the UK and European Union countries have fallen compared with last year and there is a demographic dip in the number of 18 year olds. Many universities, including in the prestigious Russell Group, will still have places on offer through the clearing system, which matches people looking for places with vacancies on courses. Good results day for Grenfell Tower pupils Malala gets A-level results and place at Oxford Manchester Arena victim had won university place A-level agony? We answer your questions Universities use chatbot to help with clearing Many other options than university Northern Ireland more than 30% get top grades Top A-level grades rise in Wales What's new about this year's A-levels Lenny Henry has been taking calls to clearing at Birmingham City University Pupils at a secondary school close to the Grenfell Tower fire in London received their AS-level results. Four pupils from Kensington Aldridge academy died in the fire and 50 were made homeless. But in this year's results, more than 40% of the pupils achieved A to B grades. Head teacher David Benson said: ""The pupils have been incredible."" Pupils from Kensington Aldridge Academy have been ""incredible"", says head teacher Changes to the qualifications system in England mean 13 A-level subjects this year have been decided solely by final exams, with no link to coursework or AS-levels taken after the first year of study. The overall results remain broadly similar to last year, with over a quarter of entries receiving top grades. The proportion of the highest A* grades has nudged up by 0.2% to 8.3%. The overall A* to E pass rate is marginally down at 97.9%. But in those new-style A-level subjects, including history, English, psychology, physics, chemistry and biology, there were 0.7% fewer A* and A grades overall. Some 24.3% of entries attained the top grades in these subjects. Exam boards said the fall in results reflected a lower-achieving group of candidates, rather than the exams being made ""more challenging"". In previous years, when more candidates sat AS levels as the first stage of the exam, some poorer performing pupils would have been ""weeded out"", said Mark Bedlow, director of regulation at exam board OCR. This video can not be played Universities Minister tells Today that the tuition fees system in place is ""fair and effective"" Leader of the ASCL head teachers' union, Geoff Barton, said that when AS-levels no longer contributed to final A-level grades, schools were increasingly likely to abandon the exam. AS-level entries have fallen by more than 40% this year, and Mr Barton said he regretted this ""narrowing"" of options. But changes to A-level exams, including updated content, were defended by John Blake, head of education at the Policy Exchange think tank. He said they had been designed to end a culture within schools of pupils repeatedly resitting exams to get the best grade.  This was painful and time-consuming for teachers and pupils, he claimed. There has been a new format for many A-levels this year ""It led to less teaching time and made it harder to get a proper grasp of the subject."" But there have been concerns from pupils who have been the first to take these revised exams. A survey of A-level students from the Student Room website found worries about a lack of textbooks and practice papers for the new style of exams. Alex Scharaschkin, director of research and compliance at AQA board, said: ""We do sympathise and understand it's an anxious time for students who are the first to go into these first qualifications."" He said some groups of pupils will have adapted to the changes easily, while others would have found it more difficult. Schools minister Nick Gibb said: ""We want everyone, regardless of background, to be able to fulfil their potential and for many, A levels are the pathway to a university degree. ""The increase in entries to facilitating subjects, those that give students the greatest choice of options at university, mean even more young people will have access to all the opportunities higher education provides. ""There has been a strong uptake in core subjects, such as maths, which continues to be the most popular A level with maths and further maths having nearly 25 per cent more entries than in 2010.""

Deadly van attack in Barcelona tourist area,"This video can not be played Eyewitness tells the BBC: ""Families were screaming for their kids"" Thirteen people died and dozens were injured when a van ploughed into crowds in Barcelona's famous Las Ramblas area, Catalan police and local officials say. The rented vehicle sped along the pedestrian area that is popular with tourists, mowing down people and sending others fleeing for cover. Spain's Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said it was a ""jihadist attack"". Two people have been arrested, but police say neither was the driver, who fled on foot. Early on Friday morning, Catalan police said an operation was taking place in town of Cambrils, to the south-west of Barcelona, in response to a ""possible terrorist attack"" and have told people there to stay indoors. The authorities also say an explosion on Wednesday evening at a house outside Barcelona that left one person dead was connected to the Las Ramblas attack. Dozens of gas cylinders were found at the house in the town of Alcanar, about 100km (60 miles) south west of Barcelona, and Reuters quoted a police source as saying residents were preparing explosives. In another incident, police shot dead a man who drove into officers at a checkpoint on the outskirts of Barcelona, but the authorities said there was no evidence that he was connected to the attack in Las Ramblas. Live updates What we know so far Aftermath in pictures Police have released a photo of a man named as Driss Oukabir, whose documents were used to rent the van involved in the attack. Local media say he is in his 20s, and was born in Morocco. However, latest reports suggest he has told police he was not involved, and that his documents were stolen. Police released this photo of Driss Oukabir, whose documents were used to rent the van So-called Islamic State has said it was behind the van attack in Las Ramblas, saying in a brief statement carried by its Amaq news agency that it was carried out by ""Islamic State soldiers"". The group gave no further evidence or details to back this claim. The attack happened at the height of the season in one of Europe's top tourist destinations. Witnesses said the van deliberately targeted people, weaving from side to side as it drove down the boulevard. Vehicles have been used to ram into crowds in a series of attacks across Europe since July last year. Gordon Corera, BBC News security correspondent Barcelona is just the latest European city to witness the terrible effects of a vehicle attack on an iconic or ""soft"" target. In Nice a year ago, Bastille Day celebrations were targeted, then a Christmas market in Berlin. In London, Westminster and London Bridge, as well as Finsbury Park, saw cars and vans used as weapons. In the UK, new barriers have been put in place to mitigate some of the risks at key locations and there is discussion of imposing checks on those renting vans, but security services in Britain - as well as across Europe - are all too aware that there are limits to what they can do to spot and stop those planning murder in this way. The weapons employed are readily available and there is little or no training, co-ordination or planning required. This means there are  few points where individuals can be spotted by the intelligence services. Although so-called Islamic State has released a statement saying what it calls its ""soldiers"" had carried out the Barcelona attack, it is not yet clear whether there was any direct link to the group or if they were simply inspired by its call to act. The language used often indicates the latter. Either way, authorities will be bracing themselves for the possibility of further attacks of a similar nature. A businessman from New Orleans, who was just arriving in a taxi in Las Ramblas, said: ""I heard a crowd screaming. It sounded like they were screaming for a movie star. ""I saw the van. It had already been busted on the front. It was weaving left and right, trying to hit people as fast as possible. There were people lying on the ground."" This video can not be played Footage shows police surrounding a white van moments after the attack Aamer Anwar said he was walking down Las Ramblas, which was ""jam-packed"" with tourists. ""All of a sudden, I just sort of heard a crashing noise and the whole street just started to run, screaming. I saw a woman right next to me screaming for her kids,"" he told Sky News. ""Police were very, very quickly there, police officers with guns, batons, everywhere. Then the whole street started getting pushed back. ""Police officers who got there just started screaming at people to move back, move back."" This video can not be played Footage captures people using a shop as an escape route on Las Ramblas Kevin Kwast, who is on holiday in Barcelona with his family, said: ""I was eating with my family in La Boqueria market very near where the crash occurred. ""Hundreds of people started stampeding through the market... we started running with them going outside right into where casualties were already on the ground. ""Police pushed us into a money transfer shop and we've been sheltering there for over an hour."" Prime Minister Rajoy has travelled to Barcelona and declared three days of national mourning. ""Terrorists are defeated by unity,"" he said. Barcelona's mayor, Ada Colau, said the city would hold a minute of silence on Friday at midday. The United States has offered its assistance to Spain. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson also said consular assistance was being provided to Americans in the city, and urged US nationals to check in with their families. ""Terrorists around the world should know the United States and our allies are resolved to find you and bring you to justice,"" he told reporters. UK Prime Minister Theresa May saidher thoughts were with the victims, adding that ""the UK stands with Spain against terror"". French President Emmanuel Macron said: ""We remain united and determined.""

North Korea war would be 'horrific',"US tensions with North Korea and its leader Kim Jong-un (pictured) have flared in recent weeks A military response to North Korea would be ""horrific"" but remains an option, the top military adviser to US President Donald Trump says. Gen Joseph Dunford, chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, made the comments while visiting China. He was responding to remarks by a top Trump aide ruling out military action over North Korea's nuclear programme. Tensions have flared between the US and North Korea after Pyongyang made advances in its missile testing. Mr Trump has warned the North that it faces ""fire and fury"", while Pyongyang has threatened to strike the American territory of Guam. But the sharp rhetoric of last week has since softened, with North Korea leader Kim Jong-un putting the Guam plans on hold - a move praised by President Trump. Allow Twitter content?

In another incident, police shot dead a man who drove into officers at a checkpoint on the outskirts of Barcelona, but the authorities said there was no evidence that he was connected to the attack in Las Ramblas. Live updates What we know so far Aftermath in pictures Police have released a photo of a man named as Driss Oukabir, whose documents were used to rent the van involved in the attack. Local media say he is in his 20s, and was born in Morocco. However, latest reports suggest he has told police he was not involved, and that his documents were stolen. Police released this photo of Driss Oukabir, whose documents were used to rent the van So-called Islamic State has said it was behind the van attack in Las Ramblas, saying in a brief statement carried by its Amaq news agency that it was carried out by ""Islamic State soldiers"". The group gave no further evidence or details to back this claim. The attack happened at the height of the season in one of Europe's top tourist destinations.

Judge dismisses same-sex marriage cases,"A joint case was taken by the first lesbian couple and the first gay couple to enter civil partnerships in the UK The High Court has dismissed two cases challenging Northern Ireland's ban on same-sex marriage. Delivering his judgement, a judge said it was for the Stormont Assembly, and not a judge, to decide social policy. A joint case was taken by the first lesbian couple and the first gay couple to enter civil partnerships in the UK. The second case was brought by a couple who wed in England but want theirmarriage legally recognised at home in Northern Ireland.,external Gay couple's marriage 'devalued in NI' Judgement reserved in same-sex marriage case In 2005, Grainne Close and Shannon Sickles were the first lesbian couple in the UK to celebrate a civil partnership The judge heard the cases together due to the similarities of the legal arguments. Mr Justice O'Hara said: ""It is not at all difficult to understand how gay men and lesbians who have suffered discrimination, rejection and exclusion feel so strongly about the maintenance in Northern Ireland of the barrier to same sex marriage. ""However, the judgment which I have to reach is not based on social policy but on the law."" Same-sex marriage is legal in England, Scotland, Wales and the Republic of Ireland, but is banned in Northern Ireland. Shannon Sickles, Grainne Close, and Chris and Henry Flanagan-Kane were challenging Stormont's refusal to legislate for same-sex marriage. This video can not be played BBC News NI looks at the history of Northern Ireland's same-sex marriage debate Ms Close said she was ""devastated"" by the ruling. ""For us, this is a personal matter,"" she said. ""We have families and our children are being treated differently because of today's result."" Her partner, Ms Sickles, said they would continue their legal challenge. England and Wales legalised same-sex marriage in July 2013and came into force inMarch 2014 Scotland legislated for same-sex marriage inFebruary 2014which came into effect inDecemberthat year The Republic of Ireland legalised same-sex marriage in areferendum in May 2015- becoming the only country in the world to do so by popular vote.Ireland's first same-sex marriage took place in November 2015. Twelve years ago, Northern Ireland was the first place in the UK to introduce civil partnerships. Ms Sickles and Ms Close made history on 19 December 2005 when their relationship was legally recognised in the UK's first civil partnership ceremony at Belfast City Hall. They were closely followed by Chris and Henry Flanagan-Kane, whose civil partnership took place later that same day. Chris and Henry Flanagan-Kane were the first gay couple to become civil partners During the joint challenge to the law in Northern Ireland, the couple's lawyers argued that the ban breaches Article Eight of the European Convention on Human Rights, by denying respect for their private and family lives. But a lawyer for Stormont's Department of Finance and Personnel (DFP) countered that the ban was not a breach of human rights and that civil partnerships already met the minimum requirements set out under human rights law. The couple who married in England had been granted anonymity, and their case was referred to as Petition X. Shannon Sickles and Grainne Close, pictured in 2015, have asked a judge to rule on whether the same-sex marriage ban is a breach of their human rights The campaign for same-sex marriage has been highly divisive at the Northern Ireland Assembly in recent years, and is currentlyone of the main sticking pointsin Stormont's continuing political crisis. Assembly members (MLAs) have voted five times on whether or not to introduce same-sex marriage. During the fifth vote in November 2015, MLAs voted in favour of legalisation for the first time, with the slimmest majority of 53 votes to 52. However, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) used a Stormont veto, known as a petition of concern, toblock the motion and prevent any change in the law. Alliance MLA Paula Bradshaw said it was ""shameful"" the couples had been forced to take their cases to court. Alliance MLA Paula Bradshaw said the challenge had been thrown ""firmly"" back at politicians ""Last May both Sinn FÃ©in and the DUP refused the Alliance Party's proposal to reform the petition of concern - the crucial reform that would make equal marriage a reality,"" she said. ""Now the challenge has been thrown firmly back at the politicians and it is essential we get Stormont up and running again to stabilise Northern Ireland and start delivering for everyone."" The marriage of the couple in the Petition X case was treated as a civil partnership in Northern Ireland, underthe terms of the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013,external, The devolved distinction was made possible after negotiations between a previous Westminster government and a previous Northern Ireland Assembly. The couple took their vows ""because they believe in the traditional values associated with marriage,"" according to their solicitor. ""We sighed when the ruling was read out not through disappointment, but simply because the inevitable recognition of same-sex marriage has been further delayed in Northern Ireland,"" they said. ""The work will continue, the wind is to our back."" SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said The LGBT community was ""not a punching bag to be hit again and again"". ""Ours is now the only small corner of these islands where we maintain a hierarchy of love,"" he said. ""We are increasingly isolated here and across Europe as a place where the commitment and compassion of a same-sex couple is not recognised or reflected in our law."" Sinn FÃ©in MLA CarÃ¡l NÃ­ ChuilÃ­n said the issue was at the heart of the current political crisis in Northern Ireland - where the Assembly has been in limbo since power-sharing broke down in January. ""We need to see the implementation of agreements and an end to discrimination if we are to have sustainable political institutions,"" she said. Timeline: Same-sex marriage debate.

Van hits crowds in Barcelona tourist area,"This video can not be played Eyewitness tells the BBC: ""Families were screaming for their kids"" Thirteen people died and dozens were injured when a van ploughed into crowds in Barcelona's famous Las Ramblas area, Catalan police and local officials say. The rented vehicle sped along the pedestrian area that is popular with tourists, mowing down people and sending others fleeing for cover. Spain's Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said it was a ""jihadist attack"". Two people have been arrested, but police say neither was the driver, who fled on foot. Early on Friday morning, Catalan police said an operation was taking place in town of Cambrils, to the south-west of Barcelona, in response to a ""possible terrorist attack"" and have told people there to stay indoors. The authorities also say an explosion on Wednesday evening at a house outside Barcelona that left one person dead was connected to the Las Ramblas attack.

"Raped Indian girl, 10, gives birth","India has a grim record of sexual assaults on children, with more than 10,000 raped in 2015 A 10-year-old rape victim who was denied permission for an abortion by the Indian Supreme Court last month has given birth to a baby girl. The girl is not aware that she has given birth. During her pregnancy she was told her bulge was because she had a big stone in her stomach. The baby weighing 2.2kg (4.8lb) was delivered by Caesarean section in Chandigarh at 09:22 (03:52 GMT). Both the mother and the newborn are doing fine, an official told the BBC. The girl alleges she was raped several times in the past seven months by her uncle, who has been arrested. The pregnant child caught in a media storm No abortion for 10-year-old rape victim Her pregnancy was discovered in mid-July when she complained of stomach ache and her parents took her to hospital. A local court in Chandigarh turned down the abortion plea on the grounds that she was too far into her pregnancy after a doctors' panel said that termination of the pregnancy would be ""too risky"". Later, the Supreme Court also refused to allow an abortion for her on similar grounds. As the baby was born prematurely at 35 weeks, she has been placed in the neo-natal intensive care unit of the hospital where she will remain for the next few days, the BBC's Geeta Pandey reports from Delhi. The parents of the 10-year-old girl, who said from the beginning that they did not want to have anything to do with the baby, did not even look at the newborn, our correspondent adds. The infant will be looked after by the child welfare committee until she is put up for adoption, an official said. The girl who gave birth is expected to remain in hospital for up to 10 days. Her case has dominated headlines in India for the past several weeks, with officials saying it is the first-ever case of a child so young giving birth. Indian law does not allow terminations after 20 weeks unless doctors certify that the mother's life is in danger. But in recent years, the courts have received several petitions, many from child rape survivors, seeking to terminate pregnancies after 20 weeks. In most cases, these pregnancies are discovered late because the children themselves are not aware of their condition. Child welfare activists who interact with the 10-year-old on a regular basis say that is precisely what happened with her - the girl is very innocent and had no idea what had happened to her. Her parents also missed the telltale signs of her pregnancy perhaps because she's ""a healthy, chubby child"". Besides, they couldn't imagine that their daughter could be pregnant at 10. A child under 16 is raped every 155 minutes, a child under 10 every 13 hours More than 10,000 children were raped in 2015 240 million women living in India were married before they turned 18 53.22% of children who participatedin a government study,externalreported some form of sexual abuse 50% of abusers are known to the child or are ""persons in trust and care-givers"" Sources: Indian government, Unicef The pregnant child caught in a media storm No abortion for 10-year-old rape victim At least two killed and 1,000 structures destroyed as wildfires rage in Los Angeles Watch: Ferocious and explosive fire burns behind CBS reporter 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Where is Greenland and why does Trump want it?

Grenfell Tower pupils enjoy 'good day',"This video can not be played ""With everything that's happened, I just think it shows how strong we are."" Students from Kensington Aldridge Academy, at the foot of Grenfell Tower, were among those receiving their AS-level results on Thursday. Four pupils died in thefire in the London tower block in June,50 were made homeless and the whole school has had to relocate. ""It's been tough for people,"" says Kai Chappell, the school's 17-year-old head boy. He was among about 100 Kensington Aldridge students picking up their results from a classroom in a nearby primary school. But after the trauma of the past few months, results day was a good day, according to head David Benson. Overall, 62% received A-C grades and 42% were given As or Bs and the school was in the top 10% for its value added score. The academy opened just under three years ago and its state of the art buildings are inside the emergency cordon around the tower. A temporary school is being built to house them from mid-September on Wormwood Scrubs, an open space a couple of miles away. But for the last few weeks of the summer term, pupils were allocated classrooms in other local secondary schools - Burlington Danes Academy and Latymer Upper School. As a new school, Kensington Aldridge was not yet full - there were only pupils in Years 7, 8 and 9, plus those in Year 12, who were doing AS-levels. Some students took their exams while the fire was still burning This was their first set of exam results. On the morning of 14 June, Mr Benson was among a small group of Kensington Aldridge staff standing outside, watching the tower burn. Alongside trying to find out what had happened to students and their families who lived there, an immediate concern had been to find exam rooms for pupils to take AS-levels scheduled for that morning. He says the school was closed for only two days while staff rewrote the timetable and organised the relocation. ""We tried to bring as much order and as much discipline to the situation as we could,"" Mr Benson remembers. ""I am not going to lie to you and say it was smooth. It was very, very difficult and very, very challenging ""There was the emotion of the situation and the deep concern that we had for members of our school community, but there were also a whole load of practical challenges. ""Children have one chance in life at an education. These were important exams. We had to keep going."" The school was given a lot of advice and support from educational psychologists and trauma management specialists. ""We also had our instincts,"" said Mr Benson. ""My team and I said we've got to reopen. We've got to bring the children together into one place."" ""It was so difficult that half-term after Grenfell and so sad in so many ways, but there were moments when we were inspired."" One student, who escaped with injuries, continued to email her homework from hospital. ""The overwhelming majority of students in the aftermath of the fire were eager to come to school, they were eager to see their friends, they were eager to carry on with their learning."" David Benson was with the Kensington Aldridge students on results day Kai got A grades in all four of his subjects. ""It's definitely good news. I was quite anxious,"" he said. ""Our teachers have done so much for us."" Amin, 16, got two As and a C - but he said he was thinking of one of his closest friends who died in the fire, along with her family, as he opened the envelope. ""I will never forget them,"" he said. ""They were people who I saw every day after school. That could have been me. That could have been my own family."" Jade, 17, said her results of three As and a B were a ""huge surprise - it shows how strong we are as a school"". Daniel was one of those who had an exam on the very morning of the fire. ""The building was still burning. You're worrying about people in the tower, but you are also worrying about your future because the exam can decide your future. ""Really ambitious people, really talented people lost everything. ""It should give us strength to achieve the best in our life to make sure we don't waste our lives. ""The fact that we can walk in here and get our results and have smiles on our faces, it's part of remembering and it's part of celebrating the people who lived in Grenfell."" Daniel was among the students who took exams on the morning after the fire Mr Benson says he expects the school to be in its temporary buildings for about a year. ""We need to continue to tread carefully and to continue to have support in place for pupils, staff and parents who have been affected."" He says his pupils have been ""incredible"". ""They had the bravery and the courage to come back in, feeling very confused and uneasy about what had to happen. ""They had the maturity to listen to us about what was important and then they supported each other through it."" Boys help to raise A-level grades What is new about this year's A-levels?

Injuries as van hits crowds in Barcelona,"This video can not be played Eyewitness tells the BBC: ""Families were screaming for their kids"" Thirteen people died and dozens were injured when a van ploughed into crowds in Barcelona's famous Las Ramblas area, Catalan police and local officials say. The rented vehicle sped along the pedestrian area that is popular with tourists, mowing down people and sending others fleeing for cover. Spain's Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said it was a ""jihadist attack"". Two people have been arrested, but police say neither was the driver, who fled on foot. Early on Friday morning, Catalan police said an operation was taking place in town of Cambrils, to the south-west of Barcelona, in response to a ""possible terrorist attack"" and have told people there to stay indoors. The authorities also say an explosion on Wednesday evening at a house outside Barcelona that left one person dead was connected to the Las Ramblas attack. Dozens of gas cylinders were found at the house in the town of Alcanar, about 100km (60 miles) south west of Barcelona, and Reuters quoted a police source as saying residents were preparing explosives. In another incident, police shot dead a man who drove into officers at a checkpoint on the outskirts of Barcelona, but the authorities said there was no evidence that he was connected to the attack in Las Ramblas. Live updates What we know so far Aftermath in pictures Police have released a photo of a man named as Driss Oukabir, whose documents were used to rent the van involved in the attack. Local media say he is in his 20s, and was born in Morocco. However, latest reports suggest he has told police he was not involved, and that his documents were stolen. Police released this photo of Driss Oukabir, whose documents were used to rent the van So-called Islamic State has said it was behind the van attack in Las Ramblas, saying in a brief statement carried by its Amaq news agency that it was carried out by ""Islamic State soldiers"". The group gave no further evidence or details to back this claim. The attack happened at the height of the season in one of Europe's top tourist destinations. Witnesses said the van deliberately targeted people, weaving from side to side as it drove down the boulevard. Vehicles have been used to ram into crowds in a series of attacks across Europe since July last year. Gordon Corera, BBC News security correspondent Barcelona is just the latest European city to witness the terrible effects of a vehicle attack on an iconic or ""soft"" target. In Nice a year ago, Bastille Day celebrations were targeted, then a Christmas market in Berlin. In London, Westminster and London Bridge, as well as Finsbury Park, saw cars and vans used as weapons. In the UK, new barriers have been put in place to mitigate some of the risks at key locations and there is discussion of imposing checks on those renting vans, but security services in Britain - as well as across Europe - are all too aware that there are limits to what they can do to spot and stop those planning murder in this way. The weapons employed are readily available and there is little or no training, co-ordination or planning required. This means there are  few points where individuals can be spotted by the intelligence services. Although so-called Islamic State has released a statement saying what it calls its ""soldiers"" had carried out the Barcelona attack, it is not yet clear whether there was any direct link to the group or if they were simply inspired by its call to act. The language used often indicates the latter. Either way, authorities will be bracing themselves for the possibility of further attacks of a similar nature. A businessman from New Orleans, who was just arriving in a taxi in Las Ramblas, said: ""I heard a crowd screaming. It sounded like they were screaming for a movie star. ""I saw the van. It had already been busted on the front. It was weaving left and right, trying to hit people as fast as possible. There were people lying on the ground."" This video can not be played Footage shows police surrounding a white van moments after the attack Aamer Anwar said he was walking down Las Ramblas, which was ""jam-packed"" with tourists. ""All of a sudden, I just sort of heard a crashing noise and the whole street just started to run, screaming. I saw a woman right next to me screaming for her kids,"" he told Sky News. ""Police were very, very quickly there, police officers with guns, batons, everywhere. Then the whole street started getting pushed back. ""Police officers who got there just started screaming at people to move back, move back."" This video can not be played Footage captures people using a shop as an escape route on Las Ramblas Kevin Kwast, who is on holiday in Barcelona with his family, said: ""I was eating with my family in La Boqueria market very near where the crash occurred. ""Hundreds of people started stampeding through the market... we started running with them going outside right into where casualties were already on the ground. ""Police pushed us into a money transfer shop and we've been sheltering there for over an hour."" Prime Minister Rajoy has travelled to Barcelona and declared three days of national mourning. ""Terrorists are defeated by unity,"" he said. Barcelona's mayor, Ada Colau, said the city would hold a minute of silence on Friday at midday. The United States has offered its assistance to Spain. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson also said consular assistance was being provided to Americans in the city, and urged US nationals to check in with their families. ""Terrorists around the world should know the United States and our allies are resolved to find you and bring you to justice,"" he told reporters. UK Prime Minister Theresa May saidher thoughts were with the victims, adding that ""the UK stands with Spain against terror"". French President Emmanuel Macron said: ""We remain united and determined.""

LeBlanc: Top Gear to 'expand the comedy',"Matt LeBlanc joined Top Gear in 2016 Matt LeBlanc has given viewers a taster of what they can expect from the next series of Top Gear. The 25th series of the show - due to air in spring 2018 - will see LeBlanc return to host alongside Rory Reid and Chris Harris. ""I think we've tried to broaden the demographic of the show,"" the presenter said. ""Try to make it not lose the petrolhead nature of it but maybe open it up to people who aren't so petrolheady. LeBlanc co-presents with Rory Reid (left) and Chris Harris ""Expand the comedy, try to have bigger, broader films, but it will be more of the same in the sense it starts with the car."" LeBlanc will return to the UK in the coming weeks to shoot footage for the show - so far he's been filming in Norway, France, Italy and California. ""It will be closer to what it was last year versus the season before,"" he added. Has Matt LeBlanc 'saved' Top Gear? What the critics said about the most recent Top Gear Top Gear: Do overnight TV ratings matter? The most recent series was more popular with critics than the one before it - which saw Chris Evans on hosting duties. Evans hadn't been popular with viewers and heleft the showafter fronting one series. But LeBlanc declined to discuss viewing figures, which have generally been lower since the departure of previous hosts Jeremy Clarkson, James May and Richard Hammond. Matt LeBlanc was popular with viewers. Chris Evans... not so much The trio moved to Amazon Prime to start the Grand Tour after Clarksonpunched a producer. He later apologised  after settling a Â£100,000 racial discrimination and injury claim. BBC Two controller Patrick Holland has previously said Top Gear's last series drew a ""much healthier"" audience and it should not be compared to the Clarkson era, which was a ""completely different"" show. The BBC has also said that younger audiences rated the most recent series ""far higher"" than they did previous ones. LeBlanc was speaking from Los Angeles as he promoted the last series of Episodes, the comedy he stars in alongside Stephen Mangan and Tamsin Greig. The 50-year-old said it will be hard to leave behind the show, which has been a ""inspiring, magic, special journey"".

Bannon dubs white nationalists 'clowns',"Steve Bannon (l), pictured with another key White House figure (r) Jared Kushner, is seen as one of the most influential voices in the Trump administration The chief White House strategist Steve Bannon has attacked white nationalists as ""clowns"" as the fallout from violent protests in Charlottesville continues. Mr Bannon once headed the right-wing Breitbart News, seen as both a major channel for nationalism and key in helping Donald Trump win election. But hetold The American Prospect,external: ""Ethno-nationalism - it's losers."" Questions surround Mr Bannon's future, with President Trump refusing to say whether he still had confidence in him. Mr Trumphas reportedly been urged,externalto fire Mr Bannon, who in his role has enjoyed direct access to the president and whose influence has been seen in decisions like the US withdrawing from the Paris climate accord. At a news conference this week, Mr Trump would only say ""we'll see"" when it came to Mr Bannon's future. Bush presidents wade into Trump furore over Charlottesville A White House meltdown in the making Mr Trump is under fire for his response to Saturday's clashes between far-right and counter-protesters in Charlottesville, Virginia, in which he blamed ""both sides"" for the violence. The rally, attended by neo-Nazis and white supremacists, was in protest at the removal of a statue of Robert E Lee, a general who fought for the pro-slavery Confederacy during the US Civil War. This video can not be played What Trump said versus what a BBC journalist on the ground saw A memorial was held on Wednesday for Heather Heyer, a 32-year-old woman killed when a suspected far-right sympathiser drove a car into a crowd of counter-protesters. Meanwhile Apple chief executive Tim Cookhas become the latest business leaderto criticise President Trump, saying he did not agree there was a ""moral equivalence"" between white supremacists and ""those who oppose them"". In his interview with the US magazine, Mr Bannon was asked if there was a connection between the economic nationalism that he supports and the white nationalism seen in Charlottesville. This video can not be played Susan Bro, Heather Heyer's mother: 'They tried to kill my child to shut her up' ""Ethno-nationalism - it's losers,"" he said. ""It's a fringe element. I think the media plays it up too much, and we gotta help crush it, you know, uh, help crush it more."" ""These guys are a collection of clowns,"" he added. Trump fuels speculation on Bannon's future Who is Steve Bannon? Mr Bannon has distanced himself from ""ethno-nationalism"" before,telling the New York Times,externalhis interest in nationalism stems from wanting to curb the negative effects of globalisation. North Korea: Despite Donald Trump threatening North Korea with ""fire and fury"", in his interview Mr Bannon said there was no military solution to the crisis over the Pyongyang's nuclear programme. ""Until somebody solves the part of the equation that shows me that 10 million people in Seoul don't die in the first 30 minutes from conventional weapons, I don't know what you're talking about, there's no military solution here, they got us,"" he said. A top US military official, Gen Joseph Dunford,saida military solution would be ""horrific"" but said that President Trump had told him and other military leaders ""to develop credible, viable military options, and that's exactly what we're doing"". China: Mr Bannon said if anything North Korea was just a ""sideshow"" to the real challenge the US is facing - ""economic war"" with China. ""If we continue to lose it, we're five years away, I think, ten years at the most, of hitting an inflection point from which we'll never be able to recover,"" he said, adding that the US intended to challenge China over intellectual property rights, and iron and steel dumping. In response, the Chinese foreign ministry said joint trade brought ""real benefits"" to both sides, Reuters news agency reported. ""We hope that relevant parties can stop viewing issues of the 21st Century with a 19th or 20th Century mentality,"" a spokesperson said. White House infighting: Mr Bannon admitted he was facing an internal battle for the administration to take a firmer line on Chinese trade, but said opponents were ""wetting themselves"".

Apple boss joins Trump condemnation,"Apple chief executive Tim Cook has become the latest boss to criticise President Donald Trump over his response to the white nationalist rallies in Virginia. Mr Cook said he did not agree there was a ""moral equivalence"" between white supremacists and ""those who oppose them"". Mr Trumphas disbanded two business councilsafter top bosses resigned. Mr Cook said Apple will also make donations to human rights charities. In an email to staffobtained by BuzzFeed News,externalMr Cook said: ""I disagree with the president and others who believe that there is a moral equivalence between white supremacists and Nazis, and those who oppose them by standing up for human rights. ""Equating the two runs counter to our ideals as Americans."" He added that ""in the wake of the tragic and repulsive events in Charlottesville, we are stepping up to help organisations who work to rid our country of hate"". Apple will donate $1m to both the Southern Poverty Law Center and the Anti-Defamation League. It will also match two-for-one any staff donations to these and several other human rights groups until 30 September, Mr Cook said. On Wednesday, Mr Trump said he was scrapping two business councils after more bosses quit over his handling of the violent clashes in Virginia. Trump ends business groups as CEOs quit A White House meltdown in the making Business mutiny leaves Trump isolated Business leaders left the White House manufacturing council after the backlash against how he reacted to the far-right rally last weekend. The clashes culminated in a woman's death and nearly 20 wounded when a car ploughed into a crowd of anti-fascist protesters. Mr Trump's reaction has sparked outrage and generated global headlines. His announcement on Twitter came as the heads of 3M, Campbell Soup, Johnson & Johnson and United Technologies announced their resignations on Wednesday. Denise Morrison of Campbell Soup was the eighth CEO to resign from a White House business panel Mr Trump said: ""Rather than putting pressure on the businesspeople of the Manufacturing Council & Strategy & Policy Forum, I am ending both."" Before Mr Trump's announcement, the Strategy and Policy Forum announced it was a joint decision to disband the council. Businesses have been under pressure to distance themselves from Mr Trump over his handling of the clashes in Charlottesville, Virginia. On Monday, Mr Trump belatedly condemned the white supremacist and neo-Nazi groups that rallied in a small Virginia town on Sunday. But in a rancorous news conference on Tuesday he backtracked and again blamed left-wing counter-protesters for the violence too. JPMorgan chief executive Jamie Dimon, a member of the Strategy and Policy Forum, released a separate statement on Wednesday saying he strongly disagreed with Mr Trump's recent statements, adding that ""fanning divisiveness is not the answer"". ""Constructive economic and regulatory policies are not enough and will not matter if we do not address the divisions in our country. It is a leader's role, in business or government, to bring people together, not tear them apart,"" he said. Denise Morrison of Campbell Soup said she could not continue to participate in the advisory panel after Mr Trump's comments. Activists had called on Campbell Soup, among other firms, to take action.

Boys help A-level grades edge upwards,"Boys results have overtaken girls in top grades in this year's A-levels Top A-level grades have increased for the first time in six years, as teenagers in England, Wales and Northern Ireland get their results. A* and A grades were awarded to 26.3% of entries - up by 0.5 percentage points compared with last year - with boys overtaking girls in top grades. There was a fall in the top grades for 13 subjects in England with new content and now assessed only by final exams. The number of university places allocated so far has dropped this year. In A* and A grades, boys have moved ahead of girls, with 26.6% of boys getting these results compared with 26.1% of girls, reversing a 0.3% gap last year. The change is significant because girls outperform boys at every stage of their education, and have been performing better at the top grades at A-levels for 17 years. There have been suggestions this could reflect the introduction of the new style of A-level exam. As results were being received, the Ucas admissions body said 416,000 university places had so far been confirmed - down 2% on the same point last year. University applications from the UK and European Union countries have fallen compared with last year and there is a demographic dip in the number of 18 year olds. Many universities, including in the prestigious Russell Group, will still have places on offer through the clearing system, which matches people looking for places with vacancies on courses. Good results day for Grenfell Tower pupils Malala gets A-level results and place at Oxford Manchester Arena victim had won university place A-level agony? We answer your questions Universities use chatbot to help with clearing Many other options than university Northern Ireland more than 30% get top grades Top A-level grades rise in Wales What's new about this year's A-levels Lenny Henry has been taking calls to clearing at Birmingham City University Pupils at a secondary school close to the Grenfell Tower fire in London received their AS-level results. Four pupils from Kensington Aldridge academy died in the fire and 50 were made homeless. But in this year's results, more than 40% of the pupils achieved A to B grades. Head teacher David Benson said: ""The pupils have been incredible."" Pupils from Kensington Aldridge Academy have been ""incredible"", says head teacher Changes to the qualifications system in England mean 13 A-level subjects this year have been decided solely by final exams, with no link to coursework or AS-levels taken after the first year of study. The overall results remain broadly similar to last year, with over a quarter of entries receiving top grades. The proportion of the highest A* grades has nudged up by 0.2% to 8.3%. The overall A* to E pass rate is marginally down at 97.9%. But in those new-style A-level subjects, including history, English, psychology, physics, chemistry and biology, there were 0.7% fewer A* and A grades overall. Some 24.3% of entries attained the top grades in these subjects. Exam boards said the fall in results reflected a lower-achieving group of candidates, rather than the exams being made ""more challenging"". In previous years, when more candidates sat AS levels as the first stage of the exam, some poorer performing pupils would have been ""weeded out"", said Mark Bedlow, director of regulation at exam board OCR. This video can not be played Universities Minister tells Today that the tuition fees system in place is ""fair and effective"" Leader of the ASCL head teachers' union, Geoff Barton, said that when AS-levels no longer contributed to final A-level grades, schools were increasingly likely to abandon the exam. AS-level entries have fallen by more than 40% this year, and Mr Barton said he regretted this ""narrowing"" of options. But changes to A-level exams, including updated content, were defended by John Blake, head of education at the Policy Exchange think tank. He said they had been designed to end a culture within schools of pupils repeatedly resitting exams to get the best grade.  This was painful and time-consuming for teachers and pupils, he claimed. There has been a new format for many A-levels this year ""It led to less teaching time and made it harder to get a proper grasp of the subject."" But there have been concerns from pupils who have been the first to take these revised exams. A survey of A-level students from the Student Room website found worries about a lack of textbooks and practice papers for the new style of exams. Alex Scharaschkin, director of research and compliance at AQA board, said: ""We do sympathise and understand it's an anxious time for students who are the first to go into these first qualifications."" He said some groups of pupils will have adapted to the changes easily, while others would have found it more difficult. Schools minister Nick Gibb said: ""We want everyone, regardless of background, to be able to fulfil their potential and for many, A levels are the pathway to a university degree. ""The increase in entries to facilitating subjects, those that give students the greatest choice of options at university, mean even more young people will have access to all the opportunities higher education provides. ""There has been a strong uptake in core subjects, such as maths, which continues to be the most popular A level with maths and further maths having nearly 25 per cent more entries than in 2010.""

At the height of the fire widespread flames could be seen across the site and more than 70 firefighters were in attendance. Workers, who had been processing orders and loading vans, were evacuated. There were no reports of any injuries. Crews are continuing to hose down the building. The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service (SFRS) said despite extensive damage, much of the building had been saved. Market fire 'will hit hospitality sector' The British Hospitality Association had predicted that the blaze would affect local restaurants, flower shops and cafes which rely on daily deliveries from Blochairn. City Property, which owns the site, said it was trying to establish alternative arrangements so that normal business could resume as soon as possible. SFRS deputy assistant chief officer John Joyce said: ""What I can tell you is that we've saved a very good proportion of it. ""In fact the site operator are pretty happy with the parts that we have saved because that is the main operational part of the building. ""It's a real shame for those businesses which have been badly affected, but we're working with the businesses and the city council to get the functioning part open as soon as possible."" He said a specialist fire investigation team would attempt to establish the cause of the fire in the coming days. BBC Scotland understands one line of inquiry being looked at by the fire investigation team is the possibility the fire started in a fridge in the fruit market.

He said there had been reports of a small fire at the other end of the market. Mr Neilson said he had not thought the fire would impact on his the part of the site, and he went to check the fruit market area. ""It really was like a raging inferno through there at the far end,"" said Mr Neilson. ""I ran back in and shouted to our staff 'everybody get out right now'."" He said deliveries were left lying and vans were left half-loaded. ""The most important thing is everybody got out,"" he said.

Cornish fish restaurant named best in UK,"""If you stay true to yourself, get your head down, look after your customers and use the very best ingredients available to you, you'll make it to the top,"" said Outlaw A Cornish fish restaurant has been named best in the UK, after five years at the top for the previous winner. The Good Food Guide put Port Isaac's Restaurant Nathan Outlaw, named after its owner, just ahead of Cumbria's L'Enclume, ending its winning run. Traditional favourites such as The Ritz and Heston Blumenthal's The Fat Duck still feature in thetop 50 list,external. Outlaw described the news as ""phenomenal"" and attributed the success to the ""hard work of the team"". The 39-year-old chef founded the two Michelin star restaurant in 2007 and first made it on the list in 2009 at number 11. Good Food Guide editor Elizabeth Carter said: ""Nobody seems to leave Nathan Outlaw's staff - they just go and work in another one of his restaurants. ""They obviously think he's a pretty good boss as well as a fine chef."" Despite losing the top slot, Simon Rogan's L'Enclume in Cartmel retained its perfect 10 score. Pollen Street Social in London, Restaurant Sat Bains in Nottinghamshire and The Fat Duck in Berkshire came in at third, fourth and fifth, each scoring nine. Stark's Ben Crittenden was named ""chef to watch"" Stark, a 12-seater restaurant in Broadstairs, Kent, is so pushed for space that it does not have a toilet. Diners can instead pop up the road to the local pub. Despite its lack of facilities, its chef, Ben Crittenden, has been named ""chef to watch"" by the Guide. Peter Sanchez-Iglesias won the chef of the year title for the seasonal cuisine he serves at Casamia in Bristol, which was tenth on the list. TheGood Food Guide,external, published by Waitrose, started ranking the UK's restaurants in 1951. Each year it assembles a long-list from thousands of recommendations sent in by the public.

Firefighters tackle huge warehouse blaze,"This video can not be played Dramatic footage of Glasgow fruit market fire A massive blaze at a warehouse in Glasgow has been brought under control.

Top A-level grades edge upwards,"Boys results have overtaken girls in top grades in this year's A-levels Top A-level grades have increased for the first time in six years, as teenagers in England, Wales and Northern Ireland get their results. A* and A grades were awarded to 26.3% of entries - up by 0.5 percentage points compared with last year - with boys overtaking girls in top grades. There was a fall in the top grades for 13 subjects in England with new content and now assessed only by final exams. The number of university places allocated so far has dropped this year. In A* and A grades, boys have moved ahead of girls, with 26.6% of boys getting these results compared with 26.1% of girls, reversing a 0.3% gap last year. The change is significant because girls outperform boys at every stage of their education, and have been performing better at the top grades at A-levels for 17 years. There have been suggestions this could reflect the introduction of the new style of A-level exam. As results were being received, the Ucas admissions body said 416,000 university places had so far been confirmed - down 2% on the same point last year. University applications from the UK and European Union countries have fallen compared with last year and there is a demographic dip in the number of 18 year olds. Many universities, including in the prestigious Russell Group, will still have places on offer through the clearing system, which matches people looking for places with vacancies on courses. Good results day for Grenfell Tower pupils Malala gets A-level results and place at Oxford Manchester Arena victim had won university place A-level agony? We answer your questions Universities use chatbot to help with clearing Many other options than university Northern Ireland more than 30% get top grades Top A-level grades rise in Wales What's new about this year's A-levels Lenny Henry has been taking calls to clearing at Birmingham City University Pupils at a secondary school close to the Grenfell Tower fire in London received their AS-level results. Four pupils from Kensington Aldridge academy died in the fire and 50 were made homeless. But in this year's results, more than 40% of the pupils achieved A to B grades. Head teacher David Benson said: ""The pupils have been incredible."" Pupils from Kensington Aldridge Academy have been ""incredible"", says head teacher Changes to the qualifications system in England mean 13 A-level subjects this year have been decided solely by final exams, with no link to coursework or AS-levels taken after the first year of study. The overall results remain broadly similar to last year, with over a quarter of entries receiving top grades. The proportion of the highest A* grades has nudged up by 0.2% to 8.3%. The overall A* to E pass rate is marginally down at 97.9%. But in those new-style A-level subjects, including history, English, psychology, physics, chemistry and biology, there were 0.7% fewer A* and A grades overall. Some 24.3% of entries attained the top grades in these subjects. Exam boards said the fall in results reflected a lower-achieving group of candidates, rather than the exams being made ""more challenging"". In previous years, when more candidates sat AS levels as the first stage of the exam, some poorer performing pupils would have been ""weeded out"", said Mark Bedlow, director of regulation at exam board OCR. This video can not be played Universities Minister tells Today that the tuition fees system in place is ""fair and effective"" Leader of the ASCL head teachers' union, Geoff Barton, said that when AS-levels no longer contributed to final A-level grades, schools were increasingly likely to abandon the exam. AS-level entries have fallen by more than 40% this year, and Mr Barton said he regretted this ""narrowing"" of options. But changes to A-level exams, including updated content, were defended by John Blake, head of education at the Policy Exchange think tank. He said they had been designed to end a culture within schools of pupils repeatedly resitting exams to get the best grade.  This was painful and time-consuming for teachers and pupils, he claimed. There has been a new format for many A-levels this year ""It led to less teaching time and made it harder to get a proper grasp of the subject."" But there have been concerns from pupils who have been the first to take these revised exams. A survey of A-level students from the Student Room website found worries about a lack of textbooks and practice papers for the new style of exams. Alex Scharaschkin, director of research and compliance at AQA board, said: ""We do sympathise and understand it's an anxious time for students who are the first to go into these first qualifications."" He said some groups of pupils will have adapted to the changes easily, while others would have found it more difficult. Schools minister Nick Gibb said: ""We want everyone, regardless of background, to be able to fulfil their potential and for many, A levels are the pathway to a university degree. ""The increase in entries to facilitating subjects, those that give students the greatest choice of options at university, mean even more young people will have access to all the opportunities higher education provides. ""There has been a strong uptake in core subjects, such as maths, which continues to be the most popular A level with maths and further maths having nearly 25 per cent more entries than in 2010.""

UK 'plans visa-free post-Brexit travel',"The government plans to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit, the BBC understands. But if visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. EU citizens are currently free to live and work in the UK without a permit. The Home Office says managing migration is about access to work and benefits as much as the ability to control entry at a physical border. Brexit: What is at stake in EU-UK talks? But ministers are likely to face questions about whether there will be a ""back door"" into Britain and how the Home Office would stop visitors staying longer and getting jobs without a visa or a work permit. Labour MP Ben Bradshaw, a member of the Open Britain campaign against a ""hard Brexit"", said: ""Nobody who voted to leave the European Union expected Brexit to mean Britain losing control of immigration, yet that is exactly what the government proposes. ""Restricting the right to come and work in Britain while leaving an open door for everyone else seems to be opposite of a common sense immigration system. ""It will not restrict anybody coming here from Europe who does not intend to work and may push other EU nationals into the black economy."" He said the proposed new system ""offers little control while burdening British businesses with yet more red tape"" and the government should ""put single market membership back on the table"" instead. The Migration Watch pressure group said it was a ""sensible, proportionate"" proposal but the government would need to spend more money on immigration enforcement to deal with overstayers. The Home Office said: ""Proposals for the future immigration system for EU citizens will be published in due course."" Prime Minister Theresa May said free movement ""as we've seen as members of the European Union"" will end and there will be immigration rules ""for people coming from inside EU - as today we have rules for people coming from outside the EU"". The UK already grants visa-free travel to nationals from 56 countries - ranging from the United States to the Maldives. Passports are stamped on entry, and people are allowed to stay for a maximum of six months. But they are not allowed to work, study or settle. It's hardly surprising that a similar scheme is being considered for nationals from EU countries after Brexit - not least because future arrangements are likely to be reciprocal. In other words, if EU citizens needed visas to come to the UK in the future, UK citizens would need visas to travel to the EU. So it may be that the government's immigration plans will be to add several hundred million Europeans to a scheme that already exists. And the main burden for policing it, and checking whether people are here legitimately, would not fall on a beefed up border guard or immigration service. Rather, it would rest with employers - everyone from the NHS to a small high street cafe - as well as landlords, banks and local government agencies. According to The Times, the new system for EU visitors will be phased in after Britain officially leaves the EU in March 2019, with those coming to work in the UK initially having to register with the Home Office without work restrictions. It would be up to the EU to decide whether the offer of visa-free travel - if it is formally proposed by the UK Brexit negotiating team - would be reciprocated. The EU is working on a travel authorisation scheme for visitors to the EU, similar to the US ESTA visa-waiver scheme. Sources in Brussels said it would be a matter for the negotiations whether UK travellers will have to apply to it after Brexit. Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage has accused the government of caving in to EU demands. But Brexit-backing Conservative MP Andrew Bridgen said: ""I don't think anybody ever intended we were just going to pull the shutters down and become a Little England. ""The same restrictions will apply to UK citizens who wish to visit the Continent. ""I mean, did you really think we were going to have a visa system just to go for a weekend to Paris?"" Lord Green of Deddington, chairman of Migration Watch UK, said: ""The point is that a work permit system for EU workers would lead, in due course, to a massive decrease in net migration from the EU as low-paid workers are squeezed out. ""The reduction could, by our calculation, be about 100,000 a year."" He said enforcement could be done through employers but the government would have to spend more money on a ""crackdown"" on illegal immigration, something he said was ""increasingly necessary"" in any case. Migration Watch says 80% of EU migrant workers are currently ""low-paid"", althoughtheir definition,externalis people who would not qualify for a Tier 2 non-EU visa, which has a minimum salary requirement of Â£35,000. The government says it wants to progress to negotiations with the EU about the future operation of its border controls as quickly as possible. On Wednesday, the government said there should beno hard borderbetween Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland after Brexit. A paper detailing its proposals stressed there should be no physical infrastructure - such as customs posts - at the border, which has almost 300 crossing points. Critics said the proposals lacked credible detail, with Labour deriding the plans for the border as a ""fantasy frontier"".

Battle of Britain planes grounded,"The Battle of Britain Memorial Flight planes are a popular sight at summer shows Most of the historic aircraft that make up the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight (BBMF) have been grounded due to an engine issue. A Lancaster bomber, two Hurricanes and three Spitfire planes are all affected by the problem. The BBMF has three other Spitfires with different engines which are currently unavailable for other reasons. The RAF said it had ""taken the decision to temporarily pause flying of our aircraft powered by Merlin engines"". For live updates and more news from Lincolnshire Prince joins WWII flight commemorations Bomber flies again after overhaul A spokesperson said: ""A routine engine inspection has highlighted a fault with one of our Merlin engines. We are currently investigating the fault."" The decision to halt flying was ""purely as a precaution"" but safety was ""paramount"" and the unit was still operating its Griffon-engined Spitfires, they added. RAF Coningsby in Lincolnshire, where the unit is based, confirmed an appearance at Weymouth Carnival had to be cancelled on Wednesday afternoon. The BBMF has also cancelled its appearance at Eastbourne Airbourne. A Spitfire, a Hurricane and a Lancaster bomber were due to appear at the air show later. Organisers are waiting to see if it will be able to appear on another day as the show runs until Sunday. Meanwhile, organisers of Biggin Hill's Festival of Flight, which is taking place this weekend, said: ""The Battle of Britain Memorial Flight will not appear this weekend unless we're told otherwise."" The air show takes place at the site of an airfield south of London that played a central part in the Battle of Britain in 1940. Colin Hitchins, of the festival, added: ""It's a great shame. But we'll see what happens. If they can make it, great, but if not, we'll see them next year."" The festival is due to feature other Spitfires and Hurricanes, he added. The BBMF is home to one of only two airworthy Lancaster bombers anywhere in the world The RAF states the mission of the BBMF,externalis ""to maintain the priceless artefacts of our national heritage in airworthy condition in order to commemorate those who have fallen in the service of this country, to promote the modern day air force and to inspire the future generations"". The aircraft can regularly be seen in the skies at air shows and military events. The RAF spokesman was unable to say when they would be back in action. One of the planes is the last remaining airworthy Spitfire which flew in the Battle of Britain, and the Lancaster is one of only two left flying in the world. The news comes before the first ever airshow atRAF Scampton,external, which is due to be held in early September and include planes from the BBMF. In July, the Duke of Cambridge attended an air displaymarking 60 years of the BBMF. Prince William, who is the flight's patron, also spoke to veterans at the event. The Battle of Britain Memorial Flight was formed on 11 July 1957 by Gp Capt Peter Thompson, a former Battle of Britain Hurricane pilot He set about collecting and preserving examples of the main aircraft involved in the conflict to honour the RAF's defence of the UK against German attacks at the end of 1940 The BBMF has 12 historical aircraft, including a Lancaster - one of only two left flying in the world; the other is in Canada It also has a Dakota, six Spitfires, two Hurricanes, and two Chipmunks, which are used for training The flight has been displayed or flown at thousands of events as a tribute to those who have served in the RAF Prince joins WWII flight commemorations Bomber flies again after overhaul Grounded Lancaster starts flight testing.

University entries down on A-level day,"Boys results have overtaken girls in top grades in this year's A-levels Top A-level grades have increased for the first time in six years, as teenagers in England, Wales and Northern Ireland get their results. A* and A grades were awarded to 26.3% of entries - up by 0.5 percentage points compared with last year - with boys overtaking girls in top grades. There was a fall in the top grades for 13 subjects in England with new content and now assessed only by final exams. The number of university places allocated so far has dropped this year. In A* and A grades, boys have moved ahead of girls, with 26.6% of boys getting these results compared with 26.1% of girls, reversing a 0.3% gap last year. The change is significant because girls outperform boys at every stage of their education, and have been performing better at the top grades at A-levels for 17 years. There have been suggestions this could reflect the introduction of the new style of A-level exam. As results were being received, the Ucas admissions body said 416,000 university places had so far been confirmed - down 2% on the same point last year. University applications from the UK and European Union countries have fallen compared with last year and there is a demographic dip in the number of 18 year olds. Many universities, including in the prestigious Russell Group, will still have places on offer through the clearing system, which matches people looking for places with vacancies on courses. Good results day for Grenfell Tower pupils Malala gets A-level results and place at Oxford Manchester Arena victim had won university place A-level agony? We answer your questions Universities use chatbot to help with clearing Many other options than university Northern Ireland more than 30% get top grades Top A-level grades rise in Wales What's new about this year's A-levels Lenny Henry has been taking calls to clearing at Birmingham City University Pupils at a secondary school close to the Grenfell Tower fire in London received their AS-level results. Four pupils from Kensington Aldridge academy died in the fire and 50 were made homeless. But in this year's results, more than 40% of the pupils achieved A to B grades. Head teacher David Benson said: ""The pupils have been incredible."" Pupils from Kensington Aldridge Academy have been ""incredible"", says head teacher Changes to the qualifications system in England mean 13 A-level subjects this year have been decided solely by final exams, with no link to coursework or AS-levels taken after the first year of study. The overall results remain broadly similar to last year, with over a quarter of entries receiving top grades. The proportion of the highest A* grades has nudged up by 0.2% to 8.3%. The overall A* to E pass rate is marginally down at 97.9%. But in those new-style A-level subjects, including history, English, psychology, physics, chemistry and biology, there were 0.7% fewer A* and A grades overall. Some 24.3% of entries attained the top grades in these subjects. Exam boards said the fall in results reflected a lower-achieving group of candidates, rather than the exams being made ""more challenging"". In previous years, when more candidates sat AS levels as the first stage of the exam, some poorer performing pupils would have been ""weeded out"", said Mark Bedlow, director of regulation at exam board OCR. This video can not be played Universities Minister tells Today that the tuition fees system in place is ""fair and effective"" Leader of the ASCL head teachers' union, Geoff Barton, said that when AS-levels no longer contributed to final A-level grades, schools were increasingly likely to abandon the exam. AS-level entries have fallen by more than 40% this year, and Mr Barton said he regretted this ""narrowing"" of options. But changes to A-level exams, including updated content, were defended by John Blake, head of education at the Policy Exchange think tank. He said they had been designed to end a culture within schools of pupils repeatedly resitting exams to get the best grade.  This was painful and time-consuming for teachers and pupils, he claimed. There has been a new format for many A-levels this year ""It led to less teaching time and made it harder to get a proper grasp of the subject."" But there have been concerns from pupils who have been the first to take these revised exams. A survey of A-level students from the Student Room website found worries about a lack of textbooks and practice papers for the new style of exams. Alex Scharaschkin, director of research and compliance at AQA board, said: ""We do sympathise and understand it's an anxious time for students who are the first to go into these first qualifications."" He said some groups of pupils will have adapted to the changes easily, while others would have found it more difficult. Schools minister Nick Gibb said: ""We want everyone, regardless of background, to be able to fulfil their potential and for many, A levels are the pathway to a university degree. ""The increase in entries to facilitating subjects, those that give students the greatest choice of options at university, mean even more young people will have access to all the opportunities higher education provides. ""There has been a strong uptake in core subjects, such as maths, which continues to be the most popular A level with maths and further maths having nearly 25 per cent more entries than in 2010.""

UK shale gas reserves 'overhyped',"The gas reserves in shale rocks in the UK have been ""hyped"", an academic said. Professor John Underhill from Heriot-Watt University said the UK's potential shale deposits were likely to have been disrupted by shifts in the earth 55 million years ago. He said the government would be wise to formulate a Plan B to fracking for future gas supplies. But the fracking firm Cuadrilla said it would determine how much gas was present from its test drilling. Hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, is a technique designed to recover gas and oil from shale, a sedimentary rock found worldwide. The amount of shale gas available in the UK is acknowledged to be a great unknown. Cuadrilla said estimates from the British Geological Survey (BGS) indicated a large potential gas reserve. What is fracking and why is it controversial? But Prof Underhill said his research on the influence of tectonic plates on the UK suggested that the shale formations have been lifted, warped and cooled by tectonic action. These factors make shale gas production much less likely. ""The complexity of the shale gas basins hasn't been fully appreciated so the opportunity has been hyped,"" he told the BBC. This is very different from the US, where big deposits of shale gas were created in the continental heart of America, far from the movement of tectonic plates. Prof Underhill's comments are based on an unpublished paper on tectonics. He said he deduced the impact on shale formations by chance. He said: ""I'm neutral about fracking, so long as it doesn't cause environmental damage. But the debate is between those who think fracking is dangerous and those who think it will help the economy - and no-one's paying enough attention to the geology. Prof Underhill said UK shale basins had been partly formed by magma under Iceland Prof Underhill said: ""For fracking to work, the shale should be thick enough, sufficiently porous, and have the right mineralogy. The organic matter must have been buried to a sufficient depth and heated to the degree that it produces substantial amounts of gas or oil."" Professor Underhill said the UK had been tilted strongly by tectonic movement caused by an upward surge of magma under Iceland. This subsequently led the shale gas basins to buckle and lift, so areas that were once buried deep with high temperatures which generated oil and gas, were then lifted to levels where they were no longer likely to generate either. The basins were also broken into compartments by folds which created pathways that have allowed some of the oil and gas to escape, he said. A spokesman for the BGS said it could not comment formally on Prof Underhill's comments as it had not done the research. Cuadrilla's technical director Mark Lappin told the BBC: ""We have noted the BGS estimates for gas-in-place and consider that volume to be indicative of a very large potential reserve. ""It's the purpose of our current drilling operations to better understand the reserve, reduce speculation from all sides and decide if and how to develop it. ""I expect Professor Underhill would be supportive of the effort to understand the resource including geological variation."" Thegovernment's opinion tracker,externalshowed public support for fracking has fallen to 16%, with opposition at 33%. But it also reported a lack of knowledge of the technology, with 48% of people neither supporting nor opposing it. Professor Richard Davies, from Newcastle University, told BBC News: ""It's correct to say geology could yet surprise the companies who are investing. But the bottle neck, I think, is how many wells one can drill economically in a small space in the UK. ""Shale gas wells in the USA produce very small volumes of gas (2-6 billion cubic feet of gas each), and therefore thousands would be needed to impact on our reliance on imports. ""The BGS estimated resources in Northern England of 1,327 trillion cubic feet (2012). I estimated it would require c. 52,000 wells to produce 10% of this.""

Spain rescues 600 migrants in a day,"This video can not be played The migrants were a mix of North Africans and sub-Saharan Africans Spain's coastguard says it has rescued 600 migrants crossing from Morocco in a 24-hour period, amid a spike in the number of migrant arrivals. The rescued migrants were in 15 vessels including toy paddleboats and a jet ski and included 35 children and a baby. The UN says more than 9,000 people have arrived in Spain so far this year - three times as many as the previous year. More than 120 people are believed to have drowned attempting the crossing. The increase in crossings means Spain could overtake Greece this year in terms of the number of migrants arriving by sea, the UN's International Organization for Migration (IOM) said earlier this month. Migrants on flimsy boats leave Tangier coast for Spain The deadly Spanish route attracting migrants to Europe Are migrants paying price as EU targets Med smugglers? Most are sailing across the 12km (seven-mile) Strait of Gibraltar and many are choosing cheap, child-sized paddle boats without motors that allow them to bypass people-smuggling networks and their fees. The majority are West Africans, with Nigeria, Guinea and Ivory Coast the top countries of origin. But Bangladeshis have also been leaving North Africa in their thousands. Unlike Syrians, Iraqis or Afghans arriving in Europe, these groups are mostly treated as economic migrants, rather than refugees. The numbers heading for Spain are dwarfed by the boatloads that have sailed to Italy this year. Nearly 100,000 people have crossed from Libya to Italy since the start of the year. The IOM says 2,242 people have died on that route. In June, about 5,000 people were rescued in one day in the Mediterranean off Libya, Italian coastguards said. But in July the number crossing to Italy dropped by 57% compared with June, according to the EU's border agency, Frontex. It was the lowest level of arrivals in July since 2014. Frontex described three factors contributing to that fall: bad weather, clashes in areas of Libya where people-smugglers are active, and more systematic patrolling by Libyan coastguards. This video can not be played A boat full of migrants lands at a popular tourist beach in southern Spain. Some migrants are using social media to contact the Spanish authorities and inform them of their location once they are in territorial waters, the BBC's Gavin Lee in the Spanish city of Tarifa says. The number of migrants arriving in Spain by sea does not include those entering the Spanish enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla in North Africa, which are the EU's only land borders with Africa. Both enclaves are tightly guarded, and ringed by high fences topped with razor-wire, yet migrants regularly try to storm in, usually at night. Greece was the main Mediterranean pressure point until March 2016, when the EU reacheda deal with Turkey,externalto intercept migrant boats crossing to Greek islands near the Turkish coast. After that, the numbers on that route dropped sharply. But tighter border controls in the Balkans also made it much harder for migrants to journey to Central Europe. The death rate among migrants at sea is greater this year than in 2016. The Libya-Italy crossing is longer and more hazardous than the crossings to Greece or Spain. In other developments: Bulgaria's Defence Minister Krasimir Karakachanov said up to 600 soldiers would be deployed along Bulgaria's fenced-off border with Turkey, as an armed deterrent to keep out migrants. He announced the plans in aninterview with Germany's Die Welt newspaper,external A Spanish NGO called Proactiva Open Armsaccused a Libyan coastguard boatof chasing its vessel Golfo Azzurro north in international waters, preventing it from rescuing migrants at sea. Three charities - Save the Children, Doctors Without Borders (MSF) and Sea Eye - have suspended their rescue work, alleging threats from the Libyan coastguard. A note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries such as Syria, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants.

In a rush? Here's your morning briefing,"Hello. Here's your morning briefing: Teenagers in England, Wales and Northern Irelandend their nervous wait for A-level results today. There's been a drop in applications for university this year, which BBC education correspondent Sean Coughlan predicts will mean a ""buyer's market"" for those looking for places. Changes to the qualifications system mean many A-levels are being decided by final exams, with no link to AS-levels. But the national results are expected to be kept similar to last year, when a quarter of entries received top grades. More than 400,000 university places are likely to be decided on Thursday - and tens of thousands more places will be available through the clearing system, which matches people looking for places with vacancies on courses. Under the new system, students sit all A-level exams at the end of two years of study, instead of taking modular exams throughout the course. AS-level results no longer count towards A-level grades. No subject will have more than a 20% coursework component and most courses will be assessed entirely through exams. Resits will still be available, but January exams will be scrapped, so students will have to wait until May/June of the following year for a chance to improve their grades.
