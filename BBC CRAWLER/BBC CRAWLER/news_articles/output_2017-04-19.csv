'Living at home with my dead father',"Most of us don't like to think or talk about death, but there are some people who do. In the Toraja region of Sulawesi, in Indonesia, the dead are a constant part of day-to-day life. The plain wood-panelled living room, with no furniture and just a few pictures on the wall, is filled with chattering voices and the smell of coffee. It is an intimate family gathering. ""How is your father?"" one guest asks the host, and the mood suddenly changes. Everyone glances at the small room in the corner, where an old man is lying on a colourful bed. ""He's still sick,"" replies his daughter, Mamak Lisa, calmly. Smiling, Mamak Lisa gets up and walks over to the old man, gently shaking him. ""Father we have some visitors here to see you - I hope this doesn't make you uncomfortable or angry,"" she says. Then she invites me to step inside and meet Paulo Cirinda. This video can not be played Although her father died 12 years ago, Mamak Lisa still keeps his body at the family house My eyes are fixed on the bed. Paulo Cirinda lies completely motionless - not even a blink - though I could hardly see his eyes through his dusty glasses anyway. His skin looks rough and grey, dotted with countless holes, as if eaten by insects. The rest of his body is covered by several layers of clothing. I have been staring for far too long when his young grandchildren playfully run into the room, and snap me back to reality. ""Why is granddad always sleeping?"" one of them asks with a cheeky laugh. ""Granddad, wake up and let's go eat!"" the other one almost shouts. ""Shhhâ¦ Stop disturbing granddad, he's sleeping,"" Mamak Lisa snaps at them. ""You're going to make him angry."" Now, here's the surprising thing. This man, Paulo Cirinda, died more than 12 years ago - yet his family think he's still very much alive. To outsiders, the idea of keeping a dead man's body on show at home feels quite alien. Yet for more than a million people from this part of the world - the Toraja region of Sulawesi in eastern Indonesia - it's a tradition dating back centuries. Here, animist beliefs blur the line between this world and the next, making the dead very much present in the world of the living. After someone dies, it may be months, sometimes years, before a funeral takes place. In the meantime, the families keep their bodies in the house and care for them as if they were sick. They are brought food, drink and cigarettes twice a day. They are washed and have their clothes changed regularly. The dead even have a bowl in the corner of the room as their ""toilet"". Furthermore, the deceased are never left on their own and the lights are always left on for them when it gets dark. The families worry that if they don't take care of the corpses properly, the spirits of their departed loved ones will give them trouble. Traditionally, special leaves and herbs were rubbed on the body to preserve it. But nowadays, a preserving chemical, formalin, is injected instead. It leaves a powerful chemical reek in the room. Lovingly stroking her father's leathery cheekbones, Mamak Lisa says she still feels a strong emotional connection with him. ""Although we're all Christians,"" she explains, with hand on heart, ""relatives often visit him or call on the phone to see how Dad's doing, because we believe that he can hear us and is still around.""

My own father passed away some years ago, and he was buried almost immediately - before I had time to fully grasp what had happened. I still haven't quite managed to deal with my grief. Mamak Lisa To my surprise, Lisa tells me that having her father in the house has helped her to grieve. It's given her time to adjust slowly to his new identity - that of a dead man. During their lives, Torajans work hard to accumulate wealth. But rather than striving for a luxurious life, they're saving up for a glorious departure. Cirinda will lie here until his family is ready to say goodbye - both emotionally and financially. His body will finally leave the family home during an unimaginably lavish funeral, after a grand procession around the village. According to Torajan belief, funerals are where the soul finally leaves this Earth and starts its long and hard journey into Pooya - the final stage of the afterlife, where the soul gets reincarnated. Buffaloes are believed to be the carriers of the soul into the afterlife and that's why families sacrifice as many of them as they can, to help make the journey easier for the deceased. Torajans spend most of their lives saving up for these rituals. Once the families have saved up enough, they invite all friends and relatives from all over the world. The wealthier the deceased when alive, the larger and more elaborate these ceremonies. The funeral I attend is for a man called Dengen, who died more than a year ago. Dengen was a rich and powerful man. His funeral lasts for four days, during which 24 buffaloes and hundreds of pigs are sacrificed in his honour. Later, the meat is distributed among the guests, as they celebrate Dengen's life and his coming reincarnation. His son tells me that the funeral has cost in excess of $50,000 - or more than 10 times the average annual income. I couldn't help but to compare this lavish, loud and colourful outdoor funeral - filled with dance, upbeat music, laughter and of course blood - to my dad's. For him, we held a small ceremony with intimate family, in a small, dark and quiet venue. I am left with a very sad and dark memory of that day - in extraordinary contrast to what Dengen's family will remember from his funeral. After the funeral, it's finally time to inter the dead. Torajans are rarely buried in the ground. Instead, they are either interred in family tombs or placed inside or outside caves - as it's a mountainous region, there are many of them.  These caves are yet another place where the afterlife seemingly connects with this one. Sometimes winding for kilometres, they hold innumerable coffins and corpses, and even loose skulls and bones. Friends and family bring ""necessities"" for their dead relatives - often money and cigarettes. In a tradition pre-dating photography, the images of dead noble men and women are carefully carved out of wood. Known astau tau, these sculptures wear the clothes, jewellery and even the hair of the deceased - silent sentinels looking out over this world from another plane. On average they cost about $1,000 to make. But even interment doesn't mean goodbye. The physical relationship between dead and the living continues long after, through a ritual calledma'nene, or the ""cleansing of the corpses"". Every couple of years, families take the coffins of long-departed relatives out of their graves and open them up, for a big reunion with the dead. At ma'nene ceremonies, friends and family offer food and cigarettes to the dead and lovingly groom and clean them. Then they pose with them for new family portraits. Torajan professor of sociology Andy Tandi Lolo describes it as a way of maintaining ""social interaction between those who are alive and those who are dead"". After Sunday prayers, I accompany people from a Torajan village as they make their way from the church to a small square building with orange tiles and no windows. It's a family tomb. Chanting mixed with the sound of women crying creates a surreal atmosphere. Everybody's here for the ma'nene of Maria Solo, who died three years ago - they say she's now 93 - and was placed in this family tomb a year ago. Now it's time for her to come back out. The men bring out a red cylindrical coffin decorated with geometrical patterns in gold and silver. On top of it, close family members place offerings to Maria - coca plant leaves, cigarettes, bitter nuts and fresh buffalo ears.  But there is one more ritual that needs to be carried out before they open the coffin and that's a buffalo sacrifice. They finally open the coffin and once again, that strong odour of musk and formalin fills the air. The body of a small old woman lies motionless inside. Her white hair is neatly tied back exposing her thin face. Her mouth and eyes are half-open and her grey skin makes her look more like a stone statue than a dead woman. How do her children feel, seeing their mother like this? Her eldest son, a businessman wearing a baseball cap, who now lives in the Indonesian capital, Jakarta, seems very calm. He tells me that it doesn't bother him at all - and not only that, it reminds him how patient his mother is and how much she loves him. Just like Cirinda's family, Maria Solo's relatives still refer to her in the present tense as if she weren't dead at all. Once the body is exposed, signs of grief and tension disappear. Even I stop feeling nervous. Another guest - particularly close to Maria Solo - is Estersobon, her daughter-in-law. She tells me that ma'nene lightens the burden of her grief and helps revive the memories of her long-departed loved-ones. I tell Estersobon that I want to remember my late father the way he was when he was alive - and that I would worry that if I ever saw him dead, this would change the image I keep of him in my mind. But Estersobon insists that it makes no difference to the way family members remember the dead. Once everyone has spent some time with Maria and taken a few family portraits with her, it is time to wrap her in a white sheet as symbol of changing her clothes. In many villages, they change the outfit for a new one and even take the corpse for a walk around the village. But these practices are slowly disappearing, as over time more than 80% of Torajans have turned away from the old animist religion,Aluk to dolo, and have become Christians. Little by little, the old ways are changing, as a result. However, Christianity and Aluk to dolo have always coexisted, for as long as Christianity has been in this region. Andy Tandi Lolo says that when Dutch missionaries first arrived, less than a century ago, they tried to forbid animist religions altogether. By the 1950s, though, they had realised that if they wanted Torajans to accept the new faith, they would have to show flexibility, and allow them to continue their rituals. In the rest of the world, these practices may seem bizarre. But perhaps the principles behind them are not so very different from those found in other cultures. Remembering the dead is something many of us try to do. The Torajans just take a very different approach.

Virgin Money boss on battling depression,"This video can not be played ""I always thought depression was something a bit weak-minded"" The hardest challenge for many business leaders is how to deal with mental health, an issue that still makes many uncomfortable. Even harder than that is when those mental health issues affect you. Jayne-Anne Gadhia, chief executive of the bank Virgin Money and one of the UK's most successful businesswomen, has told the BBC of her own efforts to tackle mental health issues. In a wide-ranging interview, she said that she had suffered post-natal depression after the birth of her daughter and had ""suicidal thoughts"" because of the intense pressure as Virgin Money was preparing for a stock market flotation. She said that it was time for businesses to speak more openly about mental health issues and that her own battles with mental health problems had made her stronger. Ms Gadhia was speaking to mark the publication of her autobiography, The Virgin Banker. In it, she describes how many business leaders still act like ""dinosaurs"" towards women. On one occasion when Ms Gadhia was finding an issue at work difficult, a senior male colleague asked her ""if she was going through the menopause"". ""I was at a dinner with some of the [banking] regulators last year and there was a very senior City man there and the conversation turned to gender equality,"" Ms Gadhia told me. ""And he said, I am all for gender equality, but what happens if I employ a woman and the next week she tells me: 'I'm pregnant?' ""And there was a gasp around the table to think that people were still thinking like that. ""I remember going back to the office and saying: 'You know what, the dinosaurs are still out there.' ""It is undoubtedly the case. I see it from time to time. ""But equally I see the opposite, I also see that senior men in the City are talking to me about how they can help. ""So I don't want to portray a picture of bleakness - there are definitely pockets that haven't improved, but there are definitely very influential men and women who want to make it [greater gender equality] work."" Ms Gadhia revealed that one of her toughest periods in work was following the birth of her daughter, Amy, in 2003. With her husband, Ash, she had been through many cycles of IVF which had not worked. They had tried one final time and Ms Gadhia had become pregnant, which had made her feel ""thrilled"". But depression struck after the birth. ""Ash had given up his job and we had only me earning, a new mouth to feed and I remember feeling completely out of control because what I wanted to achieve - that is, packing up work and staying with my child - was unachievable,"" Ms Gadhia said, speaking publicly about how she was affected for the first time. ""How on earth was I going to manage that? ""It was the first time that I'd ever, ever experienced what people described as depression. ""I had always thought, despite the fact that my mum had suffered over the years with her own issues, that depression is something that was a bit weak-minded or something. ""And when it hit me, I realised nothing could be further from the truth. ""And when I read the Harry Potter books and saw the Dementors, that is how depression felt to me - that sort of a thing that comes into your life and sucks all of your energy out of it - and I just felt hopeless. ""I didn't know where to go, I didn't know what to do do, who to talk to and at that point, everybody expects you to be happy and thrilled."" After many months of suffering - at one point, Ms Gadhia was convinced her baby daughter was dead - she eventually went to the doctor for help. The clinical tests showed that her depression was serious. ""It was knowing what I was dealing with that helped me to deal with it,"" she said. ""I think if I'd have just gone on and not realised that I had a clinical problem and that depression wasn't something that you can just sort of push through, it would have been very different."" Prince Harry has been praised for speaking out by mental health charities Ms Gadhia started working shorter hours, took exercise and put her life back into ""balance"". She says that a healthier work-life balance wasn't just good for her and her family, it was also good for work. The first year she changed the way she worked, Ms Gadhia received the highest bonus of her career. She said that it was important that businesses had an open attitude to mental health, which can affect up to one in four adults. More than 15 million working days a year are lost to problems of depression, anxiety or stress, costing businesses up to Â£70bn annually. Yesterday, Prince Harry received widespread praise after talking to the Telegraph's Bryony Gordon about his mental health problems, following the death of his mother, Princess Diana. Prince Harry revealed that he had ""shut down all his emotions"" for 16 years before seeking help. ""I think we still have a culture of not talking about it,"" Ms Gadhia said. ""I don't want to get to a place where we we've got everybody crying on each other's shoulders. ""But I think finding a way for organisations to support staff that want to talk about the issues that they're going through and having maturity of line management to know when that's required - to know where help can come - is really important. ""If someone turns up to work on crutches with a broken leg, it is easier to sympathise or empathise or help. ""But when you can't see it, I think that's much harder. It is easier to dismiss and the dismissal, the putdown if you like, makes the problem worse. ""I think that's part of the reason why both raising the issue - and in a sensible and controlled way, discussing it - means it can be remediated in some way, whatever the right way is for the individual. It's super-important.""

How do you stop sharks attacking?,"This video can not be played Surfer Mick Fanning: ""I punched the shark in the back"" How do you stop a great white shark, a creature that can grow up to six metres in length and weigh more than a tonne? It is a question that has dogged authorities in those countries where people suffer attacks by sharks (great white and others). Attacks continue to happen, and as long as they do, so will the calls for preventative measures. But what are the possible solutions? Do they make sense? And are shark attacks a big enough problem to warrant such measures? A shark shield is a device that lets out an electromagnetic pulse to deter sharks, and the Western Australia (WA) government has proposed offering a subsidy of A$200 (Â£117; $150) to anyone wanting to buy one (this is roughly equivalent to a third of the cost of the device). On the other hand, the WA opposition says shields would remain prohibitively expensive to most people, even with a discount. The University of Western Australia's Oceans Institute has been tasked with testing different shark deterrents by Australia's federal government. Speaking to media on Wednesday, Prof Shaun Collin, the institute's director, said a shark shield proved to be an effective deterrent in 400 tests of an ""investigative"" shark attack - in which the shark approaches prey to assess what it is. However, he said the shields proved ineffective in ""ambush"" attacks, in which the shark swims at speed from deep on seeing a silhouette - possibly of a surfer. Can science stop sharks attacking humans? This video can not be played The shark net debate A shark net is stretched through the water to try and separate swimmers and surfers from what may try and approach them. They are not new at all, having been used across Australia for decades. The New South Wales government ran a trial with a net from 2015-16 and, in one aspect, it proved successful - it caught 133 sharks in that time. The down side? A government report showed 615 other marine animals were caught, including 90 threatened or protected species. Close to half of them died after being caught in the netting. The nets have been called cruel by campaigners, and have been cut by activists. Why the jump in NSW shark attacks? This method, too, has been attacked as cruel - it is a baited hook suspended underwater and tied to a float on the surface of the water. It is also anchored to the sea bed, meaning the shark has nowhere to go once it has taken the bait. Larger sharks are often shot; smaller ones released. It was a policy pushed in Western Australia under the state's previous government and has been used in other Australian states. There was some controversy that drum lines were not put in place on the beach where Laeticia Brouwer died. But many also question their effectiveness - including the government now in place in WA. On Tuesday, the state's Fisheries Minister Dave Kellytold ABC,external: ""We made it clear in opposition that we don't see the merit in automatically deploying drum lines, because they don't actually make our beaches any safer. ""We want to focus on individual shark deterrence, which can actually provide genuine protection for the people who are most at risk."" The possibility of an active cull - not just killing sharks caught in drum lines - was one raised by Federal Environment Minister Josh Frydenberg on Wednesday. And while Australia's government is committed toa programme,externalof conserving shark populations, and proposals of culls are generally met with protests, there is some support for a targeted cull. An editorialin the centre-right The Australian newspaper,externalby its surf writer, written after Laeticia Brouwer's death, said ""our insane shark conservation policies have cost another life"", adding that there was blood on the hands of the government. Shark cull divides a nation There are plenty of solutions on the table - but just how big a problem are shark attacks in Australia? When Laeticia Brouwer was attacked near Esperance on Monday, she became the 15th person to be killed by a shark in Western Australia since 2000, but the first in the country since June last year. The number of shark attacks in Australia - including fatal and non-fatal - has risen over the past century, but in a way that is consistent with how Australia's population has grown. But, as horrific as those incidents are for everyone affected, there is, on average, only one death due to a shark attack in Australia every year. The number of people killed by a shark in Australian waters has changed little over the years despite the country's population - and tourist numbers - booming. In 1950, when there were8.3mpeople living in Australia, two people were killed by sharks. Last year, with a population of more than24m, there were still only two fatalities. John G West, who runs the Australian Shark Attack File, which reports all attacks for the Taronga Conservation Society, says the chances of being killed by a shark now are much slimmer than in previous years. Ina 2011 report,external, he said the number of attacks that were fatal fell from45%in the 1930s to10%in the decade leading up to 2011. But while human populations have grown, he points out that the number of sharks has fallen. One thing, though, seems sure. ""Encounters with sharks, although a rare event, will continue to occur if humans continue to enter the ocean professionally or for recreational pursuit,"" Mr West writes.

Hugh Pym: Health will be key issue in election,"Health is always discussed on the doorsteps in general election campaigns. Labour has long seen the NHS as its defining electoral issue. The Conservatives have tried hard to demonstrate their commitment with pledges in recent years of above-inflation investment. But how much difference will it make this time in a campaign that is sure to be dominated by Brexit? General Election: What you need to know Election Live: Rolling text and video updates Polling suggests the state of the NHS is high on people's list of concerns. An Ipsos/Mori survey in January in association with the Economist showed that 49% of respondents considered it to be one of the biggest issues facing Britain, up nine percentage points since December and the highest level recorded since April 2003. This was slightly ahead of the proportion (41%) seeing the EU and Brexit as a major issue.  Immigration was next on the list, though lower than in December. The same survey just before the general election in May 2015 had the economy, the NHS and immigration bunched quite closely together as issues of the highest public concern. The latest snapshot has the NHS pulling ahead of both. But the key question is whether what people tell the pollsters are key issues translates into voting intentions. The King's Fund think tank recently analysed the British Social Attitudes survey taken across England, Scotland and Wales and found that public satisfaction with the NHS was high at 63%, little changed from 2015. It is worth pointing out, though, that this polling was carried out in the summer and early autumn of 2016 before the latest bout of winter pressures. The general election health debate will be about England as governments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland run their health services and they have no elections this time. Labour made health a central plank of its 2015 election campaign. Andy Burnham, then the party's health spokesman, spoke out forcefully about the pressures on hospitals over the preceding winter. He also accused the Conservatives of encouraging privatisation of the NHS, which they in turn denied. But this failed to cut through, as the Tories achieved a majority. This time Labour is stressing that health will again be central to its campaigning effort. Jon Ashworth believes public concern about the NHS has intensified The shadow health secretary, Jon Ashworth, believes that public concern is greater than in 2015 and that a tipping point has been reached over A&E delays and longer waits for routine operations. On some benchmarks NHS England has seen its worst ever winter as hospitals have struggled to keep up with rising patient demand. What will become clear in the weeks ahead is whether patient frustration is being raised consistently with canvassers on the doorsteps. Labour will allege the Conservative government has failed to get to grips with an NHS crisis. Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour left will push their claim that the government has allowed private providers to take an increasing share of the NHS cake and there is a covert agenda to undermine the service. The proportion of the NHS budget in England allocated to private organisations has increased.  But whether this cuts any ice beyond the core Labour vote is far from certain. NHS spending will no doubt feature strongly in the campaign debates. Labour has yet to say how much more money it will pledge to health. The Liberal Democrats have hinted strongly they will call for higher NHS budgets with a ring-fenced health and social care tax. A review of health policy for the Lib Dems raised the idea of an independent body to predict spending requirements. Health spokesman Norman Lamb has pushed the idea of a cross-party approach to chart the future of the NHS. Both Labour and the Liberal Democrats have indicated they will campaign on the potential problems for the health and social care workforce when the UK leaves the EU. Promises to guarantee citizenship rights for existing staff from the EU working in this country seem likely. Jeremy Hunt will defend his record as a long-serving health secretary All that leaves the Conservatives and Jeremy Hunt, the longest-serving health secretary in modern times, defending their record on health. Party sources indicate that an ""aggressive case"" will be made and that ""scare stories"" about the state of the NHS will be rebutted. They point to the recent update on strategy by the head of NHS England, Simon Stevens, in which he pointed to cancer survival being at a record high, improved dementia diagnosis and safer patient care. What remains to be seen is how much emphasis will be given to the seven-day NHS pledge made in 2015. The Conservatives will undoubtedly be challenged on whether enough money has been allocated to the NHS up to 2020. They will highlight the Â£2bn pledged for adult social care in England over the next three years. Politicians in England will soon discover as they knock on doors whether the NHS could this time be an issue that will swing votes as well as fuelling campaign rhetoric.

Snipers and green tea on Helmand's front line,"Police and Taliban positions can be just a short distance apart in parts of Lashkar Gah When I went back to Helmand I expected to find fighting, opium fields and new frontlines.  But I didn't expect it to be so hard to distinguish between warring sides. And the fall of Sangin while I was there came as a big shock, writes BBC Afghan's Auliya Atrafi. Going home to Helmand felt different this time - things really are unstable. The last time I witnessed such a fluid situation was in the early 1990s after Kabul had fallen to the mujahideen. A few communist families were in control. After that Helmand was ruled by the mujahideen and then by the Taliban. For the last 15 years, however, it's mainly been ruled by the Afghan government, although it's still considered a Taliban heartland and a centre of insurgency, smuggling and opium. I took the road from Kabul to Helmand via Kandahar in mid-March - a precarious 10-hour bus journey. In recent months the main road leading to the provincial capital, Lashkar Gah, has been in and out of government control. From the bus I saw police stations that had been partially blown up by the Taliban. Bridges had been destroyed. The roadside was littered with the carcasses of burnt-out government Humvees. This is normally the scariest part of the journey, as Taliban fighters try to kidnap government personnel, but I didn't encounter any. Despite being surrounded by the Taliban, people in Lashkar Gah were calm. The Taliban seemed to be on the defensive as the government had started clearance operations. A few times a day American Apache helicopters flew overhead, a reassuring sign the Taliban wouldn't be allowed to take over the city. Why Sangin's fall to the Taliban matters World powers jostle in Afghanistan's new 'Great Game' The Taliban take the American planes seriously; when they briefly captured the northern city of Kunduz in 2015, they paid a heavy price. Nonetheless, staying positive was difficult. As one trader put it: ""Life is shaky and people are disappointed with governance. Fighting is so close that when we sleep at night we can hear gun shots. ""Travelling is dangerous and takes longer, and schools are barely functioning. People are generally upset."" Amid the instability, locals are trying to move forward. But they are also aware their city could move from government to Taliban hands. Many of the pragmatic Helmandis have found a guarantor - ""a Taliban cousin"" - among the insurgents in case the city falls. ""The Taliban told me to live in peace; they said their friends would arrive at my place as soon as they take the city,"" one resident said confidently. Security personnel use what cover they can to observe the Taliban Helmand is mostly made up of Sunni Pashtuns but it is also has a large Shia community. The Taliban do not target Shia, unlike other Islamist extremist groups who view Shia as heretics. But Shia are generally pro-government and making such alliances has proved harder for them than their Sunni neighbours. In Gereshk, north of Lashkar Gah, Shia are caught in the crossfire between a Taliban hotbed, Nahr Seraj, and the city. Locals are scared and some remember violence that erupted in the early 1990s when the mujahideen took over the district. ""A commander called Rais of Baghran came. He took people out of their houses and shot them; he kicked people out and looted their properties,"" said district committee member Mirza Khan. ""We left everything behind; families fled in the middle of the night and migrated to Pakistan and Iranâ¦ We fear that might be repeated again."" It wasn't just Shia - as the communist government collapsed, many communities experienced similar treatment. But Shia in Gereshk say they were targeted by the commander while Sunnis were left alone. Mirza Khan also says two tribal elders who appealed to the Taliban for the release of a prisoner two years ago were killed - something he calls a ""sort of bias"". Helmand is at the heart of Afghanistan's opium trade The Taliban say they have no racial or sectarian bias: ""What has happened must have been a personal issue,"" a Taliban spokesman told the BBC. Fear is not restricted to the Shia. In Lashkar Gah, the front line is on the city's western edge. I went to pay a visit to the border police battalion in the Bolan area. The front line here is a crowded neighbourhood where children still play traditional games outside. But most of the houses lie empty, used by the warring sides. We were advised to drive faster on some corners as the Taliban shoot at vehicles. Commander Juma Khan thought it better we had tea inside his office, saying: ""The Taliban threw a grenade into our courtyard a bit earlier."" ""Are they so close?"" I asked with a mixture of fear and astonishment. ""Yes,"" said Juma Khan, adding: ""They sometimes throw stones at us from the other side of the wall."" I later heard that the two sides can hear one another - they even jokingly invite each other for tea, though the offer is always rejected. The police station had many holes for observation and snipers. Some were on the roof and some were small tunnels. It was hard to see much through the holes, but as we drank green tea in the commander's office there was a constant exchange of small arms fire. Security personnel man checkpoints on key roads in Lashkar Gah The conflict in Helmand is complex; it is not about blind hatred and mindless killing. There are families who are fighting on opposite sides without feelings of hostility. Taliban commanders claim huge influence over government institutions. Tribal alliances and economic incentives are more important than ideology. Business transcends borders; right now there are four multi-million dollar infrastructure projects funded by the government moving forward despite the fighting. South of the Bolan hills is the road to Nad Ali and Marja districts.  A local resident told me of a traffic policeman who was seen serving at rival checkpoints. ""He would manage the traffic at the government checkpoint; when things got bad at the Taliban checkpoint, they would call him and he'd ride his rattling moped and bring order at the Taliban checkpoint."" Still, fighting continues and the Taliban generally hold the upper hand.  According to the provincial council more than 85% of the province is still under insurgent control. Of 14 districts, seven are in Taliban hands; two are under siege; in the rest, the government operates in central areas only. Troops - like this man here clearing IEDs - have cleared the road to Nad Ali To the west of Bolan lies Nad Ali. Security forces managed to clear the road to the centre after months of Taliban siege. The white flags of the Taliban indicate the front line, a few hundred metres from the main road. Government casualties were not too high during the Nad Ali operation. Air support played an important role but one of the operational commanders, Bismillah Jan, believes lines are generally thin on the Taliban side. He believes if he's given men and aerial support he can beat them back. But the security forces also lack personnel - as the decision to abandon Sangin showed. The government strategy seems to be to gather scattered forces and unite them as a solid front in central Helmand. But as soon as fighters were freed from Taliban sieges, many disappeared. ""Our 20 or so friends in those remote bases kept 200 Taliban busy. Now the Taliban can join together and attack central Gereshk district,"" Bismillah Jan warns. Disagreements and lack of co-ordination are still the overriding issues in Helmand - on both sides. On the government side, many believe the US is not fully committed to weakening the Taliban. ""There are dozens of armed Taliban, often roaming in long convoys in the countryside but the American Apaches won't touch them. They only target a small number in actual fighting,"" one official said. But there are also cracks on the Taliban side. Reports about leadership divisions are everywhere in city circles. Tribal politics and the fight for resources are profoundly influencing Taliban affairs, it seems. Some blame the killing of two influential Taliban commanders, Mehraj and Haji Ismat, by American drones on Haji Manan, the Taliban governor for Helmand who, rumour has it, is working for the US. Haji Manan's reported disagreement with Taliban leader Haibatullah is another bit of welcome news in Lashkar Gah. And there is also talk that this year the Taliban will be on the defensive in Helmand and will devote their energy to destabilising neighbouring Kandahar province instead. Whether that happens remains to be seen - but for people in Lashkar Gah, these are all hints this year may be calmer than last.

Are lower earners bearing the tax burden?,"The claim:Low and middle earners are bearing the burden of the tax take. Reality Check verdict:The government is very reliant on richer people for its funding. More than a quarter of income tax is paid by the 1% of taxpayers with the highest incomes. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell kicked off his election campaign on Wednesday by talking about increasing taxes on the rich and on corporations. ""The burden in terms of the tax take is falling on middle and low earners,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. In fact, the tax base is very reliant on rich people, with income tax becoming increasingly reliant on them. The Resolution Foundation, which does a great deal of work on inequality, says that the income tax system is relying too much on the richest 10%, which is a problem because their earnings are volatile. It also pointed out that the combined effect of tax and benefit changes was hitting the poorest people the hardest, but Mr McDonnell was not talking about benefits. This chart from the Institute for Fiscal Studies shows that about 90% of income tax is paid by the 50% of taxpayers with the highest incomes, while more than a quarter is paid by the richest 1%. Indirect taxes such as VAT and fuel duty are not progressive though - people with lower incomes do not pay lower rates - so we need to consider all taxes. The Treasury published analysis at the time of the Budget predicting what proportion of incomes people would be spending on all taxes by 2019-20. The result is in the darker green bars below the line in this chart, with the poorest households on the left and the richest on the right. The proportion of income spent on taxes does appear to be increasing as income increases throughout the distribution. The exception is for the poorest 10%, who seem to be spending slightly more than the next 10%, although the IFS says that is probably due to people misreporting their incomes in the survey from which this analysis is taken. There is more on the impact of taxes on income inthis ONS report,external, which calculates it in a different way, flattening the increase in the proportion of income spent on taxes as households get richer. Later in the interview, John McDonnell also said: ""Middle and low earners are being hit very, very hard by... income tax rises."" The basic rate of income tax has been 20% since 2008 and the higher rate has been 40% for longer than that. There have been additional rates introduced but they do not affect middle and low earners. In 2010, the income tax personal allowance, which is the amount you are allowed to earn before paying any income tax, was Â£6,475. This year it is Â£11,500. That has clearly risen considerably faster than inflation, so for people paying the basic rate of income tax there has been a tax cut, while a higher proportion of low earners are not paying income tax at all. The level of income at which people start paying the higher rate of income tax has not been rising as fast as the personal allowance, in fact it has fallen in some years since 2010, but only about 15% of income taxpayers pay higher rate, so they probably do not count as being low or middle earners.

Firebrand MÃ©lenchon galvanises French left,"In an innovative campaign Mr MÃ©lenchon addressed Parisians from a barge Is it the mellowing of age?  Is it a return to an original kinder self? Or is it all part of a brilliant pre-election re-make? No-one knows the answer, but everyone understands the question. Something has changed in Jean-Luc MÃ©lenchon. At the last election in 2012 he was the far-left candidate who ate quote-hunting journalists for breakfast. He fulminated and he fumed. Supporters loved him, but most of the population took fright. He got 11%. This time around France's scourge of capitalism is as sharp as ever with his tongue. But gone is the hate and the wall-to-wall vituperation. Instead, he plays on another rhetorical chord, which is humour. The snarl has been replaced by the smile, and the MÃ©lenchon ratings have gone through the ceiling. For his critics this is disconcerting, because behind the new-found charm they see the same irresponsible firebrand as first stormed out of the Socialist Party (PS) nearly a decade ago. Born in Tangiers in 1951 of Spanish-Italian extraction, Jean-Luc MÃ©lenchon had a career in teaching and journalism before launching himself into Socialist politics in the late 1970s. Gravitating to the left of the party, he served briefly as junior education minister under Prime Minister Lionel Jospin. In 2002 he co-founded a movement,Nouveau Monde(New World), which attacked what it saw as the Socialist party's rightward drift. Jean-Luc MÃ©lenchon chose the distinctive Greek letter phi as his movement's logo He voted against the EU's proposed constitution in 2005, on the grounds that it would turn market capitalism into a permanent state of being. Three years later he decided the Socialists had become a party of sell-outs, and left for good. After setting up a newParti de Gauche(Left Party), he was elected as a Euro MP in 2009 in an alliance with the Communists. Now he is once again backed by the Communists in this, his second presidential campaign. But he eschews traditional party affiliations. Instead, his movement is calledLa France Insoumise(France unbowed), and its symbol is the Greek letter phi (from the initials of the movement). More on the French election: French election 2017: Who are the candidates? French presidential election quick guide Patriot power: How France's alt-right seeks to sway election Holograms, mistrust and 'fake news' in election Jean-Luc MÃ©lenchon's programme has changed little from 2012. He wants the presidential system of the Fifth Republic to be replaced by a government more directly answerable to parliament. He wants a â¬100bn (Â£84bn; $107bn) state investment plan; a top tax rate of 90%; retirement at 60; a 32-hour working week; 200,000 new state-paid jobs; and a ban on firing workers when companies are making profits. He wants to renegotiate the EU treaties so that the European Central Bank answers to political, rather than purely monetary, interests; and an end to so-called ""austerity"" rules that put limits on national deficits. He would leave Nato and the IMF, and even bring France (via its territory of Guyane) into the little-known Latin American union Alba (Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas), which was set up by Cuba's Fidel Castro and Venezuela's Hugo Chavez. Mr MÃ©lenchon (R) wears a worker's jacket with a red triangle on the collar, a symbol worn by communists deported by the Nazis in World War Two Jean-Luc MÃ©lenchon's manifesto is immediately recognisable. But this time the sales pitch is different. The old iconography has disappeared. The red flags no longer fly at rallies, and he has ditched the singing of the Internationale. He refuses to be described as far-left, and does not even mind the term populist. His communications team has been masterly. This video can not be played Jean-Luc MÃ©lenchon appeared in seven places at once In popular YouTube videos he speaks directly to voters, defying the quick-click culture with detailed lectures on economics. His smartness of phrase was a hit in the presidential debates. The jibe, not the insult, is now his strength. But thepiÃ¨ces de rÃ©sistance,certainly from the PR viewpoint, have been the hologram rallies, in which he has appeared simultaneously in venues hundreds of kilometres apart, striding the stage in his old-fashioned teacher's jacket and expounding on the evils of the system. Some critics argue the whole MÃ©lenchon campaign contains an element of the hologram: his proposals are insubstantial because they are totally unrealistic. The skill has been in the communication, in articulating and spreading a message that many people, clearly, are very happy to hear.

The story behind the MS-13 street gang,"A string of brutal murders in the US has thrown a national spotlight on MS-13, a street gang that was born in LA but has roots in El Salvador. The latest was a mass murder on Monday on Long Island, where the bodies of four males, including three teenagers, were found mangled in the woods, according to police. President Trumptweeted,externalto call the gang ""bad"". Attorney General Jeff Sessions vowed to ""devastate"" it. Both blamed Obama-era immigration policy for its rise. But what is MS-13 and is Obama really to blame? The gang began in the barrios of Los Angeles in LA during the 1980s, formed by immigrants who had fled El Salvador's long and brutal civil war. Other members came from Honduras, Guatemala and Mexico. The MS stands for Mara Salvatrucha, said to be a combination of Mara, meaning gang, Salva, for Salvador, and trucha, which translates roughly into street smarts. The 13 represents the position of M in the alphabet. MS-13 established a reputation for extreme violence and for killing with machetes. It took root in neighbourhoods dominated by Mexican gangs, and later expanded to other parts of the country. According to the FBI, the gang has spread to 46 states. In 2012, the US Treasury designated the gang a ""transnational criminal organisation"". It was the first street gang to receive the dubious honour, placing it alongside much larger international cartels like the Mexican Zetas, Japanese Yakuza and Italian Camorra. MS-13 has been accused of recruiting poor and at-risk teenagers. Joining is said to require being ""jumped in"" - subjected to a vicious 13-second beating - and ""getting wet"" - carrying out a crime, often a murder, for the gang. Leaving is potentially even more dangerous. Large chest tattoos brand members for life, and some factions are said to murder members who attempt to leave. A 2008 FBI threat assessment put the size of MS-13 between 6,000 and 10,000 members in the US, making it one of the largest criminal enterprises in the country. It is now larger outside the country, according to the agency. An anti-gang crackdown in the late 1990s saw hundreds of early members shipped back to Central American countries, where they established offshoots. Estimates put the number of members in Central American countries at at least 60,000. The gang's annual revenue is about $31.2m (Â£23.4m) according to information from a large-scale Salvadorean police operation obtained by the El Faro newspaper - mainly from from drugs and extortion. Recent high-profile cases linked to the gang include the murder of two female high-school students who were attacked with a machete and baseball bat as they walked through their neighbourhood in New York last month - a revenge attack over a minor dispute, according to police. Four alleged MS-13 members were charged with that crime. Another two alleged members were charged at the same time with the murder of a fellow gang member said to have violated gang protocol. This video can not be played Inside El Salvador's Ciudad Barrios prison The same month, two alleged members of the gang in Houston, Texas were charged with kidnapping three teenage girls, holding them hostage and raping them before shooting one dead on the side of the road. Miguel Alvarez-Flores, 22, and Diego Hernandez-Rivera, 18, laughed and waved at the cameras during their court appearance. MS-13's motto is ""kill, rape, control"",according to one FBI gang specialist,externalwho investigated the group. Mr Trump and Mr Sessions have pointed the finger at former President Barack Obama over the spread of MS-13, alleging that his open-door immigration policies fuelled its growth. But the gang formed and flourished in the US long before Mr Obama came to power. MS-13 was identified as a significant threat in the 1990s, and a special FBI taskforce was convened against the gang in 1994. ""The big surge was during Bush-Cheney when the drivers of illegal migration in Central America grew, when various crackdowns on crime filled prisons to bursting point, and when funding for rehabilitation programs declined,"" Fulton T Armstrong, a research fellow at the Center for Latin American and Latino Studies at American University, told fact-checking websitePolitifact,external. ""I have seen no evidence that the Obama administration can be blamed in any way for the existence or activities of the gang in the US,"" said Ioan Grillo, author of a book on US gang crime. The Obama administration also prioritised the deportation of gang criminals, including MS-13 members, in an aggressive deportation program. Politifact rated Mr Trump's claim as false.

Farah injection not recorded properly,"Mo Farah was given the supplement before the 2014 London Marathon, in which he finished eighth The doctor who gave double Olympic champion Mo Farah a controversial supplement has told MPs that he failed to properly document the treatment. Dr Robin Chakraverty said the amount of L-carnitine was well within World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) limits. Dr Chakraverty said the substance was given to help the Briton's performance. He said he gave 13.5 millilitres of the legal supplement, below the maximum allowed of 50ml within six hours, by injection and not via drip. Ed Warner, the UK Athletics (UKA) chairman, told MPs that not recording injections was ""inexcusable"" although Dr Chakraverty said record keeping had since improved. The use of the substance, given to Farah in 2014, is being looked at by the US Anti-Doping Agency (Usada) - which has called it an infusion - to determine whether rules were broken. The injection was made in consultation with Farah's American coach Alberto Salazar. Salazar and Farah, Olympic champion in both the 5,000m and 10,000m in 2012 and 2016, havestrongly deniedbreaking any rules. Dr Chakraverty giving evidence to MPs at a 'Combating Doping in Sport' session Dr Chakraverty, formerly UKA's chief medical officer, now works with the England men's football team, He told the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee on Wednesday there had been staffing cuts at UKA and he had been responsible for the healthcare of 140 athletes in an ""immensely busy"" job. ""Where we have had lapses is when you're on the road, when you're travelling, and that is probably the unique thing about this role. Not all our athletes train in one area,"" he said. ""When you are constantly on call for athletes you travel to those athletes. If you don't record it straight away - which I didn't in this case - then it can get forgotten because you have all these other things. That is just the scenario. It is not an excuse."" Report questions Salazar testosterone explanation I am a clean athlete, says Farah Salazar 'may have breached doping rules' In March, the BBC reported thatUKA staff may not have properly recordedthe use of L-carnitine - a naturally occurring amino acid often prescribed as a supplement for heart and muscle disorders. Warner said it was ""disappointing"" the injection had not been recorded at the time by the doctor. ""That has formed part of Dr Chakraverty's annual appraisal processes. That was something which was clearly marked out by Dr Chakraverty and his line manager as in need of improvement. He won't be proud of that fact but won't shy away from the fact it's there,"" he said. Farah was given the injection during preparations before his full London Marathon debut in 2014, in which he finished eighth. Salazar has been under investigation by Usada and UK Anti-Doping (Ukad) since 2015, following claims of doping and unethical practices made in aBBC Panorama programme. At a meeting of the committee earlier this year, a doctor who received a 'mystery package' for cyclist Sir Bradley Wiggins in 2011 said he hadno record of his medical treatmentat the time. Ex-Team Sky medic Dr Richard Freeman had a laptop containing medical records stolen in 2014, the committee was told in March. Team Sky and British Cycling's record-keeping was questioned at the earlier hearing and when it was raised again on Wednesday, Warner replied: ""Please don't tar us with the same brush"". He said UKA was keen to centralise its records and now handles all of Farah's medical care. ""There was a period of a few months in which we allowed Mo to go to Oregon and be treated by a local GP over in America, and we were observing his medical care from afar,"" said Warner. ""A decision was taken that we had to make sure we were in control of all medical interventions where Mo was concerned. That should always be the case for funded athletes."" Alberto Salazar has been under investigation by the US Anti-Doping Agency An interim Usada report centres on claims a number of athletes at Salazar's Nike Oregon Project were given L-carnitine - some of which were ""almost certainly"" more than 50ml and therefore doping violations. Another former UKA doctor, Dr John Rogers, visited a training camp held in France in 2011. He reported back some concerns about the side-effects of some of the supplements Farah was taking, but stressed there were no worries that anything illegal may have been taking place. Farah was receiving supplements to help prevent stress fractures and for iron and vitamin D deficiencies. Dr Rogers told the committee Salazar's knowledge of sports medicine and science at the time was more advanced than any coach he had worked with. ""We had several conversations here and he was very open and transparent about the sports medicine practices he was using,"" he said. ""There was no concern there were any Wada rules being broken. ""There were some medical concerns around possible side-effects from some of the strategies they were using and it was important I shared that in terms of the continuity of care."" Committee chairman Damian Collins MP said at the start of the hearing that the MPs' final report into anti-doping would now not be published until after the General Election on June 8.

'Farah injection not recorded properly',"Mo Farah was given the supplement before the 2014 London Marathon, in which he finished eighth The doctor who gave double Olympic champion Mo Farah a controversial supplement has told MPs that he failed to properly document the treatment. Dr Robin Chakraverty said the amount of L-carnitine was well within World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) limits. Dr Chakraverty said the substance was given to help the Briton's performance. He said he gave 13.5 millilitres of the legal supplement, below the maximum allowed of 50ml within six hours, by injection and not via drip. Ed Warner, the UK Athletics (UKA) chairman, told MPs that not recording injections was ""inexcusable"" although Dr Chakraverty said record keeping had since improved. The use of the substance, given to Farah in 2014, is being looked at by the US Anti-Doping Agency (Usada) - which has called it an infusion - to determine whether rules were broken. The injection was made in consultation with Farah's American coach Alberto Salazar. Salazar and Farah, Olympic champion in both the 5,000m and 10,000m in 2012 and 2016, havestrongly deniedbreaking any rules. Dr Chakraverty giving evidence to MPs at a 'Combating Doping in Sport' session Dr Chakraverty, formerly UKA's chief medical officer, now works with the England men's football team, He told the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee on Wednesday there had been staffing cuts at UKA and he had been responsible for the healthcare of 140 athletes in an ""immensely busy"" job. ""Where we have had lapses is when you're on the road, when you're travelling, and that is probably the unique thing about this role. Not all our athletes train in one area,"" he said. ""When you are constantly on call for athletes you travel to those athletes. If you don't record it straight away - which I didn't in this case - then it can get forgotten because you have all these other things. That is just the scenario. It is not an excuse."" Report questions Salazar testosterone explanation I am a clean athlete, says Farah Salazar 'may have breached doping rules' In March, the BBC reported thatUKA staff may not have properly recordedthe use of L-carnitine - a naturally occurring amino acid often prescribed as a supplement for heart and muscle disorders. Warner said it was ""disappointing"" the injection had not been recorded at the time by the doctor. ""That has formed part of Dr Chakraverty's annual appraisal processes. That was something which was clearly marked out by Dr Chakraverty and his line manager as in need of improvement. He won't be proud of that fact but won't shy away from the fact it's there,"" he said. Farah was given the injection during preparations before his full London Marathon debut in 2014, in which he finished eighth. Salazar has been under investigation by Usada and UK Anti-Doping (Ukad) since 2015, following claims of doping and unethical practices made in aBBC Panorama programme. At a meeting of the committee earlier this year, a doctor who received a 'mystery package' for cyclist Sir Bradley Wiggins in 2011 said he hadno record of his medical treatmentat the time. Ex-Team Sky medic Dr Richard Freeman had a laptop containing medical records stolen in 2014, the committee was told in March. Team Sky and British Cycling's record-keeping was questioned at the earlier hearing and when it was raised again on Wednesday, Warner replied: ""Please don't tar us with the same brush"". He said UKA was keen to centralise its records and now handles all of Farah's medical care. ""There was a period of a few months in which we allowed Mo to go to Oregon and be treated by a local GP over in America, and we were observing his medical care from afar,"" said Warner. ""A decision was taken that we had to make sure we were in control of all medical interventions where Mo was concerned. That should always be the case for funded athletes."" Alberto Salazar has been under investigation by the US Anti-Doping Agency An interim Usada report centres on claims a number of athletes at Salazar's Nike Oregon Project were given L-carnitine - some of which were ""almost certainly"" more than 50ml and therefore doping violations. Another former UKA doctor, Dr John Rogers, visited a training camp held in France in 2011. He reported back some concerns about the side-effects of some of the supplements Farah was taking, but stressed there were no worries that anything illegal may have been taking place. Farah was receiving supplements to help prevent stress fractures and for iron and vitamin D deficiencies. Dr Rogers told the committee Salazar's knowledge of sports medicine and science at the time was more advanced than any coach he had worked with. ""We had several conversations here and he was very open and transparent about the sports medicine practices he was using,"" he said. ""There was no concern there were any Wada rules being broken. ""There were some medical concerns around possible side-effects from some of the strategies they were using and it was important I shared that in terms of the continuity of care."" Committee chairman Damian Collins MP said at the start of the hearing that the MPs' final report into anti-doping would now not be published until after the General Election on June 8.

Gary Snoad:Juventus might have a great defence but they were only able to play that way after dominating Barca & winning 3-0 in 1st legÂ BBC Radio 5 live The European Football Show I told you about - it's on the air now.Â You can listen to Mark Chapman as he reviews this week's Champions League matches by following the audio icon at the top of the page. Before this season, Juventus had only twice made the Champions League semi-finals in this century. On the two occasions that they got to the last four, they went through to the final, but lost them both. #bbcfootball Freddie Caine:Incredible that the whole Vidal-Pirlo-Marchisio-Pogba midfield has been moved out and yet Juve have managed to improve.

It didn't matter. BBC Radio 5 live To mark your card, BBC Radio 5 live will bring you reaction to tonight's games from 22:00 BST this evening. The semi-final draw is on Friday. #bbcfootball Strawberry Blonde:If Juve can keep out Monaco's relentless attack as well as Barcelona's then they absolutely deserve to win the Champions LeagueÂ The Old Lady... Juventus have reached the Champions League semi-finals for the seventh time, more than any other Italian side. The New Kids on the Block... Monaco are the first Ligue 1 team to reach the last four since Lyon in 2009-10. Imagine if Juventus and Monaco meet in the semis or final. Breath-taking attack against the most miserly of defences. It would be like when Homer Simpson took up boxing, with his plan being taking so much punishment that his opponent eventually collapsed in a heap. Barcelona 0-0 Juventus (agg 0-3) Neymar was in tears as he left the field. As a Brazilian who plays for Barcelona, he probably doesn't lose very often and certainly doesn't take it well.

Mourinho urges Martial to deliver more,"Anthony Martial (right) has not scored for United since a 2-0 win over Watford in February Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho has urged striker Anthony Martial to ""give me things that I like"" if he wants to feature in the first team. The 21-year-old, who joined United for Â£36m in 2015, has started 12 Premier League games this season. And the France forward was left out of the match-day squad for lastSunday's 2-0 win over Chelsea. ""I go in the direction of the players, they have to also come in my direction,"" said the Portuguese. ""The same way I know what the players like, I think the players also know what I like,"" he added. ""That's why [Marcus] Rashford, even without scoring goals, is always a player I trust and I play. He is always a player I support because he is always coming in the direction that I want from a Manchester United player. ""It's about going in the direction we like. Is Anthony [Martial] a player with great potential? Yes, I think. Can he play successfully for me? Yes, I think. But he needs to give me things that I like very much."" Martial has fallen behind Rashford in the attacking pecking order at United, with the 19-year-old England striker having scored twice in his past three games. Martial came on as a substitute in the first leg ofUnited's Europa League quarter-final in Anderlechton Thursday and could feature in the return leg at Old Trafford. Mourinho suggested that captain Wayne Rooney, who has started just one Premier League game this year because of injury, could feature on the bench on Thursday. ""He's working now and improving and if in today's training session the answer is positive I will select him to be on the bench tomorrow,"" said Mourinho. ""We have seven to play in the Premier League and hopefully four in the Europa League. ""We don't have many players. We lost players in the January market and didn't buy players. We need everyone.""

Four things worth your attention from Facebook F8,"This video can not be played WATCH: Mark Zuckerberg shows how animated artworks could be superimposed over real-world views Facebookâs annual developersâ event, held this year in San Jose, is the social network's chance to bring together all of the people that work with the site to create the apps and other features used by the almost two billion people. The event is a launching pad for new features. After a busy first day, here's my pick of the most interesting and significant. Augmented reality - thatâs when digital images are placed over the real world - is the key battleground between Facebook and its bitter rival Snapchat. And AR Studio could be the differentiator. Facebook is opening up its AR platform so developers can make use of Facebookâs immense computing power - for things like image recognition - without having to invest in the costly and complex tech themselves. AR studio is the tool they will be able to use to make the most of it. One example showed a tie up with Manchester United in which live scores, statistics and ticker-tape was slickly added over smartphone footage of fans celebrating in a bar. Little practical use, maybe, but it sets up Facebook to be the home of the best augmented reality apps, accelerating at a pace Snapchat really canât match, if you ask me. Hereâs the thing: I really donât like Facebook Messenger. Itâs an app Iâd never want to use were it not attached to Facebook, which makes it kind-of unavoidable if I want to reach my friends. That said, I know many friends who have resisted adding it to their phones. Disturbingly, David Marcus, the head of Messenger, wants to bloat this app even further by adding in a host of new integrations, many designed to help you interact even more with businesses. But I understand why. The model here is WeChat, the gigantic Chinese app that lets users do a bunch of things from within the same app. Facebook wants you use Messenger to chat to some friends about a night out and, without leaving Messenger, buy some gig tickets, make dinner reservations and book a ride-share. Facebook has added a ""discover"" page to help users find bots for its Messenger program For just idle chit-chat, Messenger is also being upgraded. Mr Marcus showed off a Spotify integration, where you can drop songs into group chat and all listen at once. Neat. Mr Marcus admitted the excitement last year around bots (some of it from yours truly, Iâll admit) never lived up to the hype. There are 100,000 bots on Messenger already, and so far none of them have been much cop (except this one from a 14-year-old boy). But the Messenger boss is confident heâs got the technology headed in the right direction. To me, it seems the âchatâ is evolving from trying to sound human, to just conceding that swift multiple choice is much more useful to all (not to mention easier to code). Facebookâs decision to buy Oculus VR was motivated by the possibility that the technology would become a social platform, and not just about gaming. Facebook Spaces is the first true embodiment of that. It places you, virtually, as a cartoony avatar, in a world inhabited by your other friends - also avatars. Here you can lark about, play games, share photos, take a âselfieâ, even do a video call with someone in the ârealâ world. Itâs a bit of silly fun. And I can already hear many of you reading this and saying âHow sad! Be friends in the real world!â. But hey, not everyoneâs friends are in visiting distance. And this is like a good Skype chat, and then some. The barrier to entry, though, is still cost. To get this experience you need the Oculus Rift, which, if you donât already have a powerful-enough PC to hand, costs upwards of $1,000 (Â£780) to get going. Which is why Facebook is working hard to make its PC-free, wireless, high-quality headset. Mark Zuckerberg brought that subject up again in his opening keynote, but didnât elaborate. Iâd hoped he might surprise everyone by showing it to us at the end of the keynote, but no such luck. For Facebook Spaces to go mainstream, that headset needs to come out fast. And it needs to be less than $500. Iâm not holding my breath. This one will sound boring, so Iâve left it until last. Facebook announced that there would be a free version of Workplace, available by the end of this year. Workplace is Facebookâs answer to collaboration tool Slack and is, in direct contrast to Facebook itself, designed to help with productivity. Right now, the full version of Workplace is free. But later this year that will change, with a paid-for premium version, offering better admin tools and things like cloud file storage and sharing, and a free version with just the basics. You may groan, but say what you like about Facebook, itiseasy to use. And so having the company design the tools you use every day at work will be pretty appealing for many people, Iâm sure. ___________ Follow Dave Leeon Twitter @DaveLeeBBC,external You can reach Dave securely through encrypted messaging app Signal on: +1 (628) 400-7370 Zuckerberg addresses 'Facebook killing' Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser LA firefighters say 'no possibility' of containing blazes as fifth wildfire breaks out Inside the neighbourhood totally lost in LA fires Starmer and Badenoch clash over call for grooming inquiry How Canada's immigration debate soured - and helped seal Trudeau's fate 'I can't get divorced as I can't get my pension valued' BBC Sound of 2025: Barry Can't Swim is a new dance music superstar Ros Atkins on...Elon Musk's political interventions A journalist's murder highlights risks of reporting in small-town India Jean-Marie Le Pen - founder of French far right and 'Devil of the Republic' Cases of HMPV are on the rise in China - but what is it?

Greece's refugee children learn the hard way,"This video can not be played Refugee children attend school in Greece The first day of school. It was supposed to be an exciting, happy time for so many of the 2,500 refugee children now living in camps in Greece. But instead some were met with stone-throwing and nationalist slogans, after far-right demonstrators took issue with the government's policy to integrate them. Fortunately for 10-year-old Moustafa, his appointed school in Thessaloniki saw no protests. And despite living in a metal container known as an isobox, the past few months have brought a form of structure to his life. He spent a year fleeing war and fearing for his life, but now he has a schedule. Every afternoon he boards a coach organised by the International Organization for Migration (IOM) that takes him to the city centre for school. He is one of 60,000 refugees and migrants trapped in Greece since relocation to European countries stagnated and the borders were closed. Nationalists protested as refugee children started school in Oraiokastro, near Thessaloniki, in February Moustafa explains how his village near Damascus was trapped between rival warring groups and, before it was too late, his family headed for Europe. He recounts the moment they were rescued from a sinking dinghy - so accurately, it is as if he is playing back recorded footage. He shows off the school kit he has been given, including notebooks, pens, pencils and a rucksack. ""The most important thing now is for me to study and learn Greek,"" Moustafa says. ""I want to be a doctor."" Read more on the migrant crisis: Greece's stranded refugees fear being forgotten Migrant camp attacked on Greek island Serbian attitudes harden as migrants gather once again The new school initiative backed by the EU follows a law passed by the Greek parliament last August. It kickstarted new classes to prepare refugee children for eventual integration into the Greek education system. Ninety-seven schools are currently involved. In three, the initiative was met with contempt. Crowds of far-right nationalists gathered to wave Greek flags, boo the children and shout slogans such as ""My homeland won't fall!"" In the town of Profitis, riot police were called in to escort pupils after stones were thrown. Nationalists demanded that Greeks should come first, not refugees In Oraiokastro, protesters chained themselves to the school gates. The self-styled ""Patriotic Union of Greek Citizens of Oraiokastro"" said they didn't believe the pupils had been adequately vaccinated - something the health ministry has denied. In Perama, there were reports of physical violence. In contrast, the arrival of pupils at Moustafa's school in Thessaloniki went smoothly. The headteacher, Ioannis Nomikoudis, says it is down to the communication between the government, school and parents' committee. ""The parents of the children here are not racist, but they do still have concerns and we cannot ignore that. The thing is, we didn't make the children's arrival debatable - like in some places."" For Education Ministry General Secretary Giannis Pantis, the fact that there were protests at only three of the 97 schools was a success. ""In many other schools the children were welcomed with songs and balloons,"" he said. He oversaw the programme from the start, when a scientific committee of leading Greek intercultural education experts and sociologists was brought together to provide advice. They assessed the work of NGOs in the camps and designed the curriculum of maths, Greek, English, art, IT and physical education. Integration into the school system is an important part of establishing a new home The implementation of the programme has not come without its problems, though. The lack of certified Greek-Arabic translators is a huge issue. The government says it is not a question of not being able to afford them, but that they just do not exist. Refugee children are taught Greek - but lessons can be hard because few Greeks speak Arabic Maths teacher Irene Voutskoglou said she did not realise how big the challenge would be. ""We can't really communicate well at all,"" she says. ""I have to appoint a student as an 'assistant teacher' to help me. I didn't even realise that numbers were different in Arabic. Our zero is a dot in Arabic for example. And our five looks like a seven in Arabic."" Most translators are provided through charities, who receive funding from the European Union. But camp coordinators say the translators' language skills are often not good enough and that they are also needed to teach the children their native language. ""This is supposed to be a transitional year,"" says Giannis Pantis, the man from the ministry. ""The children attend school in the afternoon, when the school day for current pupils has finished. We believe they cannot yet be fully integrated. ""Last week a child saw a helicopter and ran out of the school. Another started to cry and hid beneath the table. Some of these children, due to the war, are almost 10 years old but have never been to school. They can't read or write. Many of them have post-traumatic stress disorder. We have a lot to do this year."" Greek schoolchildren quickly made their refugee classmates feel at home With a flagging economy and an education system already crippled by six years of austerity, the refugee crisis has further stretched Greece's capacity. The government is reliant on just â¬7m (Â£6m; $7.5m) of European funding for the next two years (NGOs have received â¬83m directly) and the Greek national budget to implement the programme. Despite the struggles, Mr Pantis says they are determined to honour the government's commitment to the fundamental and universal right to education. A note on terminology:The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries such as Syria, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants.

Serving up a different kind of export,"You can't put a service on a container ship and send it around the world the way you can with physical goods The future of international trade has leapt up the agenda. The British vote to leave the European Union is one central reason. There is also the election of Donald Trump after a campaign in which he was highly critical of some US trade agreements. Much of the debate has focused on trade in goods. Will there be tariffs on British exports to the EU and vice versa? President Trump has threatened carmakers with a ""border tax"" if they expand operations in Mexico. But what about services? After all,the service sector dominates most economies,external. It accounts for 78% or more of national economic activity in the UK, France and the US. Those are well known as service-driven economies. But in Germany, that great manufacturing powerhouse, it's getting on for 70% and even in China it is close to half. People often travel abroad for cheaper health treatment such as dentistry When we look at cross-border trade, however, it is a rather different story.The value of global trade in goods still exceeds services,externalby a factor of more than three. But services trade is growing and it is important for many economies. Barriers to services trade have proved to be harder to deal with. They come in the form of regulation - not the tariffs or taxes that impinge on commerce in goods. Countries sometimes impose limits on the percentage share of ownership that foreign companies can have in a business that provides services. InChina,external, for example, the limit is 50% for insurance and some telecommunications services. There can also be nationality requirements. In China again, the chief partner in auditing and accounting firms must be a Chinese national. In just about all countries practitioners of many professions require approved qualifications (often for very good reasons). The extent to which there is mutual recognition of other countries' qualifications varies. There are also sometimes licensing and residency requirements which can stand in the way of cross-border provision. China may be known for its manufacturing capabilities, but services now account for half of its economy It is also the case that the nature of many services does make trade intrinsically rather more challenging. You can't put a service on a container ship and send it around the world the way you can with goods. But it is possible to trade services internationally. A stockbroker in London can buy and sell shares for German investors. People can travel abroad for health treatment. Firms can establish a commercial presence in other countries. And individual practitioners can go abroad and work as an independent supplier - perhaps as a plumber - or as an employee of, for example, an insurance company. So liberalising services trade is more complicated than it is for goods. But there have been efforts. The World Trade Organization's rulebook includes something called theGeneral Agreement on Trade in Services, or GATS.,external WTO member countries have made commitments during past negotiations about the extent to which they allow foreign suppliers access to their services markets. These vary from country to country and are listed in ""schedules"" attached to the agreement. The GATS also has rules that promote transparency, to make it easier for businesses to navigate any rules that affect them. There are also rules that prohibit discrimination between different trade partners. Governments in many of the big service-driven economies - Europe and the US in particular - have seen the GATS as a useful start, but as very much unfinished business. Attempts to regulate how services are traded are continuing So there is also a separate negotiation under way called theTrade in Services Agreement (TiSA),external. It is not yet complete and so it is not yet an ""agreement"", strictly speaking. The negotiations involve 23 WTO members. That counts the European Union as one, so it will probably rise to 24 when the UK leaves the EU. TiSA does not have a high profile in news terms, but has been very controversial. Critics,externalaccuse the governments involved of negotiating in secret. They also criticise the ""ratchet clause"" that the agreement is likely to include, which would prevent countries from reintroducing trade barriers that they had removed. Critics say that would make it harder for any government involved to reverse the privatisation of any services that had been transferred to the private sector. They also say it would undermine the rights of governments to regulate in the public interest. The European Commission - which negotiates on trade policy for the EU - rejects this. ""Quite to the contrary, the right to regulate services will be enshrined in TiSA. Rather, the objective is to tackle discrimination that currently prevents service suppliers from operating in another TiSA party,"" a spokesperson says. On the ratchet clause the Commission says,externalit won't have the effect that critics allege. And it says the EU won't make commitments on allowing foreign suppliers to provide some key publicly funded services, including health and education. Financial services exports such as share trading will be an important factor in Brexit negotiations Service industries are also likely to be an important area for British trade negotiators looking at opportunities for UK business after leaving the European Union. Financial and business services account for about half the total of British services exports, which is in the region of a quarter of a trillion pounds ($300bn). It will be an important factor for UK commercial relations with the EU, and for any new agreements that might be done with countries outside the EU, including the US. The UK still exports more goods than services, but that lead has narrowed dramatically.Research commissioned by Barclays Bank,externalprojected that services could account for more than half of British exports within a decade. So barriers to cross-border trade in services really will matter to the British and many other economies.

Do snap elections mean bigger majorities?,"Few other post-war prime ministers have called a snap election A snap general election has been announced by UK Prime Minister Theresa May, to ""guarantee certainty and security"". But what does history say about her chances of winning a greater majority? The UK doesn't generally do snap elections. Since World War Two, there are really only two other examples of a prime minister going to the country within a year or two of the previous contest. However, there have also been a few occasions which have seen prime ministers who - like Theresa May - made it to Downing Street without winning an election themselves going to the country for a ""personal mandate"". Since 2011, parliamentary terms have been fixed at five years and, even before this, elections were generally only called by prime ministers every four or five years. In March 1966 however, Labour's Harold Wilson went to the country just under 18 months after winning in October 1964. Harold Wilson called two snap elections to try to win a strong majority His decision was hardly a surprise. The 1964 election had seen Labour replace the Tories after 13 years, but with only the narrowest of majorities - just four MPs. An avid reader of opinion polls and an acute interpreter of local and by-election results, Wilson timed his strike to perfection. He bagged a majority of nearly 100, albeit one he managed to squander by 1970, when Labour was beaten by the Tories under Ted Heath - the prime minister who took the UK into Europe. By February 1974, however, Wilson was back in Downing Street - and things were even trickier than they had been 10 years previously. Rather than a tiny parliamentary majority, Labour had no majority at all. Reality Check: How do you call an early election? Reality Check: What are the polls saying? May's election U-turn General election: What you need to know Wilson was obliged to form a minority administration and hope that it could last long enough for him to convince the country that he really was the man for the job again. Wilson waited just nine months before making that appeal. The result was far from what he'd hoped for - a painfully small three-seat majority which eventually evaporated completely, leaving the government reliant on a pact with the Liberal Party. So, early elections don't always deliver everything the prime minister who calls them might wish for. But what about contests called by incumbents who have taken over at Number 10 without first winning a general election as party leader? John Major was among prime ministers who went on to win a ""personal mandate"" Well, here, the outlook is much brighter for those who call the election. Winston Churchill, after suffering at least one serious stroke that was hidden from the public, finally gave way to his successor Anthony Eden in April 1955. Eden wasted no time by calling an election in May - a contest which saw him increase his party's majority from 17 to a very respectable 60. At just under 50%, the Tories' share of the vote was the highest ever achieved in the post-war period. It wasn't enough, however, to see Eden through the Suez crisis, which led to his resignation and replacement in January 1957 by the wily Harold Macmillan. ""Supermac"", true to form, bided his time before seeking his own personal mandate and was rewarded in October 1959 with a 100-seat majority. The third Tory prime minister who initially got the top job by virtue of his support in the party rather than in the country was John Major. He waited 16 months after replacing Margaret Thatcher before calling an election in 1992, but while his victory left the Conservatives with a much reduced majority, he had avoided what two years previously looked like certain defeat. History, then, appears to be on Theresa May's side. But, given the unpredictability of the current political climate, the outcome is far from guaranteed.

Virgin Money boss speaks of battling depression,"This video can not be played ""I always thought depression was something a bit weak-minded"" The hardest challenge for many business leaders is how to deal with mental health, an issue that still makes many uncomfortable. Even harder than that is when those mental health issues affect you. Jayne-Anne Gadhia, chief executive of the bank Virgin Money and one of the UK's most successful businesswomen, has told the BBC of her own efforts to tackle mental health issues. In a wide-ranging interview, she said that she had suffered post-natal depression after the birth of her daughter and had ""suicidal thoughts"" because of the intense pressure as Virgin Money was preparing for a stock market flotation. She said that it was time for businesses to speak more openly about mental health issues and that her own battles with mental health problems had made her stronger. Ms Gadhia was speaking to mark the publication of her autobiography, The Virgin Banker. In it, she describes how many business leaders still act like ""dinosaurs"" towards women. On one occasion when Ms Gadhia was finding an issue at work difficult, a senior male colleague asked her ""if she was going through the menopause"". ""I was at a dinner with some of the [banking] regulators last year and there was a very senior City man there and the conversation turned to gender equality,"" Ms Gadhia told me. ""And he said, I am all for gender equality, but what happens if I employ a woman and the next week she tells me: 'I'm pregnant?' ""And there was a gasp around the table to think that people were still thinking like that. ""I remember going back to the office and saying: 'You know what, the dinosaurs are still out there.' ""It is undoubtedly the case. I see it from time to time. ""But equally I see the opposite, I also see that senior men in the City are talking to me about how they can help. ""So I don't want to portray a picture of bleakness - there are definitely pockets that haven't improved, but there are definitely very influential men and women who want to make it [greater gender equality] work."" Ms Gadhia revealed that one of her toughest periods in work was following the birth of her daughter, Amy, in 2003. With her husband, Ash, she had been through many cycles of IVF which had not worked. They had tried one final time and Ms Gadhia had become pregnant, which had made her feel ""thrilled"". But depression struck after the birth. ""Ash had given up his job and we had only me earning, a new mouth to feed and I remember feeling completely out of control because what I wanted to achieve - that is, packing up work and staying with my child - was unachievable,"" Ms Gadhia said, speaking publicly about how she was affected for the first time. ""How on earth was I going to manage that? ""It was the first time that I'd ever, ever experienced what people described as depression. ""I had always thought, despite the fact that my mum had suffered over the years with her own issues, that depression is something that was a bit weak-minded or something. ""And when it hit me, I realised nothing could be further from the truth. ""And when I read the Harry Potter books and saw the Dementors, that is how depression felt to me - that sort of a thing that comes into your life and sucks all of your energy out of it - and I just felt hopeless. ""I didn't know where to go, I didn't know what to do do, who to talk to and at that point, everybody expects you to be happy and thrilled."" After many months of suffering - at one point, Ms Gadhia was convinced her baby daughter was dead - she eventually went to the doctor for help. The clinical tests showed that her depression was serious. ""It was knowing what I was dealing with that helped me to deal with it,"" she said. ""I think if I'd have just gone on and not realised that I had a clinical problem and that depression wasn't something that you can just sort of push through, it would have been very different."" Prince Harry has been praised for speaking out by mental health charities Ms Gadhia started working shorter hours, took exercise and put her life back into ""balance"". She says that a healthier work-life balance wasn't just good for her and her family, it was also good for work. The first year she changed the way she worked, Ms Gadhia received the highest bonus of her career. She said that it was important that businesses had an open attitude to mental health, which can affect up to one in four adults. More than 15 million working days a year are lost to problems of depression, anxiety or stress, costing businesses up to Â£70bn annually. Yesterday, Prince Harry received widespread praise after talking to the Telegraph's Bryony Gordon about his mental health problems, following the death of his mother, Princess Diana. Prince Harry revealed that he had ""shut down all his emotions"" for 16 years before seeking help. ""I think we still have a culture of not talking about it,"" Ms Gadhia said. ""I don't want to get to a place where we we've got everybody crying on each other's shoulders. ""But I think finding a way for organisations to support staff that want to talk about the issues that they're going through and having maturity of line management to know when that's required - to know where help can come - is really important. ""If someone turns up to work on crutches with a broken leg, it is easier to sympathise or empathise or help. ""But when you can't see it, I think that's much harder. It is easier to dismiss and the dismissal, the putdown if you like, makes the problem worse. ""I think that's part of the reason why both raising the issue - and in a sensible and controlled way, discussing it - means it can be remediated in some way, whatever the right way is for the individual. It's super-important.""

Subliminal messages," Lucky in China, and a bridal and fertility symbol in the East, red is the colour of love, anger and action. It actually raises the blood pressure and generates excitement and power – it has the longest visual wavelength, so it makes a huge impact in a room. Red actually appears to be moving forward, which explains why it’s used as an 'alarm' colour. It adds urgency, youth and vigour, and lends appeal to drinks, food and services aimed at the young. It’s also used for sales and clearance sites – ‘Quick, buy it now, when it’s gone it’s gone!’ There’s an enormous sense of mystery around the colour black. It’s a challenging colour for brands to use in the West because of its association with death. But it is also the colour of luxury brands: think glossy black limousines, designer watches, and pints worth waiting for! There’s an exclusivity and a premium side to black, an aspirational element, and it’s very grown up. “I don’t need to try, I’m just quality.” It’s very powerful and sophisticated when used as a primary colour in branding. We have the Egyptians mining lapis lazuli to thank for blue, and on a more general level we’re immersed in it. It reconnects us with the earth and our place in it – the sky, the sea, the eyes of a newborn baby. Blue is seen as a reassuring, calming, tranquil colour. Blue light in public places has even been shown to reduce criminal activities. It’s the colour of reliability which is why it’s associated with banks and corporations. We trust it because it’s a constant in our lives, and we also associate it with the emergency services – the cool competence of a nurse. And by the way, if you’re in the dock, wear a blue dress or a blue suit. You’re more likely to get off. But don’t say we told you. Green is an environmental colour: it’s calming and is used to give the perception of a product being environmentally friendly. Green spaces around our houses increase their value, and hospital patients who look out on green views are nicer to their nurses. We have an emotional response to it as it reconnects us to our natural environment, so when we’re picking between two products and one looks greener, we’ll associate that with having a beneficial environmental effect. But beware of greenwashing – you might be looking at a product that’s switched to green to recover from an environmental disaster. It’s also associated with growth and prosperity – the upward line on the FTSE index is green, and it’s “Go!” on a traffic light. Purple is loved by teenage girls, Prince, and chocolate manufacturers. Purple can be overwhelming to live with. As we grow up we move away from purple, but women come back to it as they get older, possibly because it works so well with grey. It’s associated with valuable things – purple dye used to be more expensive than silver and it was worn by royalty.
