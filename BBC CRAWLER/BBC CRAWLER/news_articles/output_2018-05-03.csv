"I killed over 100 people, with no regret","Syria has been at war for seven long, deadly years. President Bashar al-Assad's government is fighting both rebel groups and the jihadists of Islamic State. The northern city of Raqqa has been a key battleground for many factions in the conflict. This is the story of how one peaceful protester there got sucked into the spiralling bloodshed, and became a killer. Warning: This piece contains descriptions of torture which some readers may find upsetting. Some names have been changed or removed. Khaled did not simply wake up in Raqqa to the smell of death and dust, and decide to become an assassin. He was sent a special invitation. Six men were ordered to report to an airfield in Aleppo, in north-western Syria, where a French trainer would teach them to kill with pistols, silenced weapons, and sniper rifles. They learned to murder methodically, taking prisoners as their victims. ""Our practice targets were detained soldiers from the regime,"" he says. ""They put them in a difficult place so you need a sniper to hit them. Or they send out a group of detainees and ask you to target one without hitting the others. ""Most of the time assassinations are done from a motorbike. You need another person to ride the bike and you sit behind him. You ride next to the target's car - then you shoot him and he cannot escape."" Khaled - not his real name - learned how to follow people. How to ""buy"" targets he could not reach through those close to them. How to distract a convoy of cars, so a fellow assassin can pick off their mark. It was a bloody, inhuman education. But in mid-2013, soon after the Syrian army retreated from Raqqa, it suited the leaders of Ahrar al-Sham - a hardline Islamist group striving to rule the northern city and eliminate its rivals. Rebels claimed near-total control of Raqqa in March 2013 Khaled was one of the group's commanders, in charge of Raqqa's security office. And yet, he told the BBC, when the Syrian revolution drew its first breaths in 2011 he was a man of peace, ""a bit religious, but not too strict"", with a job organising pilgrimages. ""It was an amazing feeling of freedom mixed with fear of the regime,"" he says, recalling the first day he joined the anti-government protests. Why is there a war in Syria? The war on IS - illustrated ""We felt that we were doing something to help our country, to bring freedom and to be able to choose a president other than Assad. We were a small group, no more than 25-30 people."" Khaled says no-one thought about taking weapons to the early protests - ""we didn't have the courage for that"", but the security forces arrested and beat people nonetheless. One day, it was him they detained.

Political Security, State Security... and then to the Central Prison where I stayed for a month before they released me. ""By the time I entered the Central Prison I couldn't walk, and couldn't sleep because of my backache."" Syria's anti-government protests began in Deraa in early 2011, triggering a national uprising Khaled says his most barbaric abuser was a guard at the Criminal Security Department who forced him to kneel before a picture of President Assad, saying: ""Your god will die, and he will not die. God dies, and Assad endures."" ""His shift was every other day, and when it came I knew I would be tortured. ""He used to hang me from my arms with chains to the ceiling. He would force me to strip, then put me on 'the flying carpet' and whip my back. He would tell me: 'I hate you, I hate you, I want to you to die. I hope you die at my hands.' ""I left his prison paralysed, and when they moved me to the Central Prison inmates were crying when they saw me. They brought me in on a stretcher. ""I decided that if God saved me I would kill him wherever he goes. Even if he went to Damascus, I would kill him."" Khaled was detained after someone recognised him in film footage from anti-government protests When he was freed from prison, Khaled took up arms against the government. He says he ""helped"" 35 Syrian army soldiers to defect from the 17th Reserve Division, which was stationed in the country's north-east. Some of them he kidnapped, selling their possessions to make money for guns. Sometimes, he says, he joined forces with attractive women to lure ""notorious individuals who hurt protesters"" with offers of marriage. He spared their lives, but forced them to make defection videos so they could never again serve President Assad. For his first hostage, the ransom was set at 15 Kalashnikovs, or their value in cash. One man received no such mercy: the guard who tormented Khaled. ""I asked people about [the guard] who worked at the Criminal Security Department until I found him. We followed him home, and took him. ""He told me something that I reminded him of later. When I was in prison, he told me: 'If you leave this prison alive and you manage to capture me, do not have mercy on me' - and that's what I did. ""I took him to a farm near the Central Prison which was a liberated area. I cut off his hand with a butcher's knife. I pulled out his tongue and cut it with scissors. And still I wasn't satisfied. ""I killed him when he begged for it. I came for revenge, so I wasn't afraid. Khaled bartered his more fortunate captives for Kalashnikov rifles ""Despite all the torture methods I used with him, I don't feel regret or sorrow. On the contrary; if he came back to life again right now I would do the same. ""If there had been an authority to complain to, to say he beats and humiliates prisoners, I wouldn't have done this to him. But there was no-one to complain to and no state to stop him."" Khaled had lost his faith in the revolution. His focus became the daily battle for his own survival. And he would soon find an even darker role in Syria's savage conflict - as an assassin for the jihadist group Islamic State (IS). Friendship or betrayal, quarrels about tactics, and swings in the balance of power: these caused many of Syria's rebels to switch between factions, sometimes repeatedly. Against that backdrop, Khaled left the Islamists of Ahrar al-Sham who had trained him as a killer, and joined al-Nusra Front, then the official affiliate of al-Qaeda in Syria. By early 2014, IS - which he and other fighters once mocked as a no-account outfit with paltry numbers - had driven rebel factions out of Raqqa. The city would become the de facto capital of IS's ""caliphate"". Black jihadist flags appeared all over Raqqa as IS tightened its grip Militants terrorised the civilian population through beheadings, crucifixions and torture. ""IS would take their property, kill and imprison them for the silliest reasons,"" says Khaled. ""If you said, 'Oh, Muhammad' they would kill you for blasphemy. Taking photos, using mobiles; these have punishments. Smoking would result in prison. They did everything - killing, stealing, rape. ""They would accuse an innocent woman of adultery then stone her to death with kids watching. I don't even kill a chicken in front of my siblings."" Inside 'Islamic State': A Raqqa diary The rise and fall of 'Islamic State' The secret deal that helped IS flee Raqqa The jihadists bought up senior rebel leaders with cash and high-status positions. Khaled was offered a job as a ""security chief"", with an office and authority over IS fighters. He understood that refusing would sign his death warrant. So he reached a terrifying personal compromise. ""I agreed,"" he says, ""but with the consent of Abu al-Abbas, a senior al-Nusra leader, I became a double agent. I showed IS a friendly face, but I would secretly kidnap and interrogate their members, then kill them. The first one I kidnapped was Syrian, the leader of an IS training camp. ""I would leak to IS whatever Abu al-Abbas wanted me to leak. Some information was true, to make IS believe me. But at the same time I took secrets from them."" Al-Nusra Front had an obvious motive for spying on IS. It had rejected a merger announced by IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in 2013, and aligned itself with other rebel groups. Khaled's decision looked like a death wish, but it was others who died. He says he murdered around 16 people for IS, shooting them in their homes with a silenced pistol. He says they had sold their religion for money, betraying Ahrar al-Sham and the Free Syrian Army - the Western-backed alliance that first wrested Raqqa from government control. Khaled says IS sent him to assassinate people in secret (file picture) One of his victims was an Islamic scholar from al-Bab. ""I knocked at the door. He opened it. I immediately went in with a gun pointed at his face. His wife started screaming. He knew that I was coming to kill him. ""Before I said anything he said to me, 'What do you want? Money? This is my money - take whatever you want.' I said no, I don't want money. And I locked his wife in the other room. ""Then he said, 'Take the money - if you want my wife you can sleep with her in front of me, but don't kill me.' What he said encouraged me to kill him."" The IS emirs in Raqqa liked novelty, and routinely killed those they had bribed to replace them with new blood. Sometimes they blamed US-led coalition warplanes for the death; sometimes they didn't bother. Just a month after taking the IS job, Khaled was sure they would come for him soon. The assassin fled for his life, first by car to the eastern city of Deir al-Zour, and later on to Turkey. Khaled appears in BBC documentary Syria: The World's War Asked if he has any regrets or thinks he could one day be prosecuted, Khaled simply says: ""All I thought about was how to escape and stay alive. ""It isn't a crime, what I did. When you see someone pointing a weapon and beating your father, killing your brother or relatives, you cannot keep quiet and no force can stop you. What I did was self-defence. ""I killed over a hundred people in battles against the regime and IS, and I don't regret itâ¦ because God knows I never killed a civilian or an innocent person. ""When I look in the mirror I see myself as a prince. And I sleep well at night, because everyone they asked me to kill, deserved to die. ""When I left Syria I became a civilian again. Now if anyone says anything rude to me, I respond - 'As you wish.'"" Khaled was interviewed last year for a documentary - Syria: The World's War - to be shown in the UK on BBC 2 at 21:00 on 3 and 4 May.

Medellin row over hit 'glorifying Escobar',"Victor Manuelle rebuffs claims he has disrespected MedellÃ­n's bloody past with his hit song Amarte Duro The mayor of the Colombian city of MedellÃ­n has demanded an apology from two Puerto Rican pop stars over their latest hit - which refers to the city's infamous past under the control of the drug lord Pablo Escobar. Federico GutiÃ©rrez accused Victor Manuelle and Farruko of celebrating drugs and Escobar. The salsa number, Amarte Duro, or Love You Hard, was released last month. The mayor said the song ignored the 20,000 victims of the Escobar era. At the height of his career, Escobar's cartel supplied an estimated 80% of the cocaine smuggled into the United States. He was killed in a shoot-out with police in MedellÃ­n in 1993. US rapper Wiz Khalifa in drug lord row Atoning for the sins of a brother Escobar's brother asks to review Narcos In an open letter, Mr GutiÃ©rrez said the two men had been irresponsible.

He said many young children still dream of being ""drug lords in their neighbourhoods because of the TV series [Narcos, shown on Netflix] where Escobar is the hero and songs, like theirs, which glorify him. ""Don't underestimate the influence they have on younger generations. ""They have no respect for our pain. This is a city which is trying to move forward, and the minimum they could do, in fact, is to respect it."" Amarte Duro includes the verses in Spanish, ""Where I let my eye fall, I put a bullet and never fail"" and ""What I feel for you is like the coca of MedellÃ­n, I am no Pablo [Escobar], but you know what I am talking about."" Mr GutiÃ©rrez also complained that the song celebrated violence against women and demanded a public apology from the two artists to both the city of MedellÃ­n and women. In an open letter posted on Twitter, Victor Manuelle said he had not intended to cause offence. ""I would never be capable of deliberately offending anyone, let alone Medellin, the city which has given me so much love throughout my career,"" he said. Allow Twitter content?

In previous statements he has denied promoting gender violence with lyrics such as ""I'm going to give it hard to you the way Chris did to Rihanna"", recallingthe star's 2009 assault at the hands of her ex-boyfriend, insisting the song is about an intense love relationship. Since the 1990s, successive MedellÃ­n mayors have worked hard to break the power of the cartels and paramilitary gangs with social and education programmes. Although the violence is much reduced, there are still small drug gangs and drug traffickers operating in the city. Escobar's drug wealth catapulted him into the Forbes list of global billionaires for seven years, ending with his 1993 death The same year, he was responsible for the bombing of Avianca Flight 203, killing 107 people In all, Escobar is thought to be responsible for some 4,000 deaths His gang targeted politicians, the police and journalists After he was arrested in 1991, Escobar was housed in a prison of his own design, nicknamed the Cathedral, where he continued to oversee the Medellin Cartel This is not the first time the MedellÃ­n mayor has complained of the glorification of drugs and Pablo Escobar. Last monthhe said US rap artist Wiz Khalifa should apologise for ""advocating crime""after he laid flowers on Escobar's grave. And last year he gave the reggaeton artist J Ãlvarez a lecture on who Escobar really was after he wore a shirt carrying references to Pablo Escobar during the inauguration of the local MedellÃ­n flower fair. He also sent a letter to the airline Air Panama which has offered a ""MedellÃ­n Narco Tour"" for $499 (Â£370) per passenger, which includes three nights in a hotel and a visit to Pablo Escobar's abandoned ranch, Napoles.

EU's Juncker: Let UK staff become Belgians,"British expats in Brussels don't want to lose the rights they currently enjoy The EU Commission President, Jean-Claude Juncker, has urged Belgium to grant citizenship to British EU staff worried about their post-Brexit status. About 1,100 UK citizens work for the EU in Brussels and Luxembourg. Mr Juncker called Belgium a kind host and asked its prime minister, Charles Michel, to ""show the same generosity when it comes to granting Belgian citizenship"" to British EU staff. When the UK leaves the EU next March Britons will lose their EU citizenship. The UK and EU have already pledged to protect citizens' rights after Brexit, but that does not mean granting nationality. Article 49 of the EU staff rules states that ""an official may be required to resign"",externalif he or she loses their EU citizenship and is no longer a national of an EU member state. Many British EU staff are longstanding residents with families. An internal EU Commission document quoted by Politico news last month,externalsaid Article 49 would not mean British staff losing their EU jobs, apart from cases involving ""conflicts of interest or international obligations"". The huge Berlaymont building in central Brussels houses the European Commission Responding to Mr Juncker's plea during a European Parliament debate, Mr Michel said Belgium's citizenship law in the context of Brexit was ""contradictory"", but he did not specify the difficulties. ""The government is examining the judicial possibilities on this question, which affects a number of people who have been living in our country for a long time,"" he said. European Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas said later that Mr Juncker's remarks were meant as a reminder for the Belgian leader. ""We live up to the promise that our colleagues of British nationality should be given maximum guarantees to stay, not only with their employment but also if they want to stay as Belgian citizens. But this is entirely in the hands of the Belgian government, not ours,"" he said. Why some Brits are opting for Belgian citizenship Brexit: All you need to know Britons win legal step in EU rights case Rights of EU citizens in UK and Britons in EU after Brexit EU citizenship is described in Article 20 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and includes the rights to: Travel and live anywhere in the EU Vote and stand as a candidate in European and local elections in another EU country Get diplomatic protection and consular help from any other EU country in another part of the world. Michael Ashbrook of Solidarity, Independence, Democracy (SID), a trade union representing EU staff, told the BBC that ""all the British staff are trying for EU citizenship"". ""They are very worried"", he said, referring to the impact of Brexit on their jobs. ""There has been talk of dismissing British 'contract agents' on Brexit day, rather than letting them complete their fixed-term contracts,"" he said. Resolving the status of British staff, to keep them in their jobs, would take the Commission ""just a few minutes"", he said. Brexit sets a legal precedent for the EU and raises a host of new legal challenges, because no state has left the 28-nation bloc before. In the debate the Belgian leader clashed with UKIP's Nigel Farage, an anti-EU MEP. ""Belgium is not a nation; it's an artificial creation,"" Mr Farage said. The Dutch- and French-speaking parts of Belgium ""dislike each other intensely"", he alleged. Mr Michel replied ironically: ""I'm happy to hear this sound advice from Nigel Farage on the future of Belgium. He has been busy with the future of Britain, with Brexit - and we can see where Britain has got to with that."" To qualify for Belgian citizenship, an applicant must have lived in Belgium for at least five years legally and passed a language test. Luxembourg requires at least five years' residence and competence in Luxembourgish, a language with only about 390,000 native speakers.

"Afghan interpreters able to stay in UKThe home secretary said fees will be waived for the interpreters who ""put their lives at risk"".4m4 minutes agoUK","Mohammed Hares is one of more than 150 Afghan interpreters who wrote to the home secretary asking for the fee to be waived Afghan interpreters who served with British troops fighting against the Taliban will be able to stay in the UK for free, the home secretary has said. More than 150 Afghans given five-year residency permits said they faced being sent back to Afghanistan when they expire, unless they paid Â£2,389 to apply for indefinite leave to remain. Sajid Javid said the fees had been waived. A spokesman for the translators said they were ""delighted"" with the news. But the group asked that their families be allowed to join them. Currently, the interpreters' wives and children are not allowed to live in the UK unless they travelled at the same time as those given permits. The group called this a ""miserable injustice"" because it was not possible for many families to gain the necessary documents to travel at the time. Afghan interpreters worked with the Army on the frontline in Helmand Province The group also said they were having to pay more than Â£1,000 to get proper documentation for children born in the UK. The home secretary said about 400 former Afghan interpreters had relocated to the UK as part of the government scheme. Mr Javid said: ""The local Afghan interpreters worked in dangerous and challenging situations, regularly putting their lives at risk.

He added that the Home Office was ""looking again at what can be done"" to make it easier for the interpreters to bring their wives and children into the country.

Ex-VW boss charged over diesel scandal,"Former VW chief Martin Winterkorn has been charged by US authorities Former Volkswagen chief executive Martin Winterkorn has been charged by US prosecutors in Detroit over the diesel emissions scandal. He has been accused of conspiring to mislead regulators about the German car maker's efforts to cheat the emissions tests of its diesel-fuelled vehicles. Charges filed in March were revealed on Thursday, adding Mr Winterkorn to the list of accused former VW executives. VW said it was cooperating with US probes and declined to comment further. US Attorney General Jeff Sessions said the indictment showed that Volkswagen's scheme to cheat its legal requirements went ""all the way to the top"". Volkswagen: The scandal explained Emissions cheat bill hits $30bn Mr Winterkorn, 70, resigned soon after the scandal over polluting vehicles in the US erupted in September 2015. He is the ninth person to be hit with US criminal charges connected to the emissions cheating scandal. Two have pleaded guilty and are serving time in prison. Despite a bill of more than $30bn in fines and buying back cars, as well as the indictment of several mid-level executives, it always seemed like the man at the top of Volkswagen would escape prosecution. Martin Winterkorn, who was in charge of the world's largest car maker during the period it installed cheat devices on millions of vehicles, has always maintained that he reported the illegal activity to authorities soon after becoming aware of it. But in an unprecedented filing against an overseas business leader, a federal grand jury in Michigan charged Mr Winterkorn with making ""false representations to regulators and the public"" about the emission levels of VW vehicles. He is already in legal trouble in Stuttgart, where VW investors claim he sat on information of the scandal, which wiped billions off the company's market value, for more than a year. But even if found guilty by US authorities, it's unlikely Mr Winterkorn, who resigned soon after the scandal broke in 2015, will ever see the inside of a US courtroom, much less prison, as Germany does not extradite its citizens. Volkswagen pleaded guilty in March 2017 to criminal charges that it deceived US regulatory agencies, including the Environmental Protection Agency and the California Air Resources Board, by installing so-called software defeat devices in diesel vehicles emissions control systems. The devices, which allowed vehicles to perform better in test conditions than they did on the road, were installed on almost 600,000 vehicles sold in the US from 2009 though 2015 and millions more globally. They came to light after a study of emissions by researchers at West Virginia University. The scandal has sparked investigations in Germany and other countries. US prosecutors say Mr Winterkorn was informed of the issue as early as May 2014 and was present at a July 2015 meeting when executives agreed to deflect questions from regulators with excuses such as ""irregularities"". VW in 2016 said,externalthat it did not know if participants at that meeting understood that the changes to the software violated US law. The firm on Thursday said: ""Volkswagen continues to cooperate with investigations by the Department of Justice into the conduct of individuals. It would not be appropriate to comment on individual cases."" Mr Winterkorn, who became chief executive in 2007, has said he was unaware of the issue until shortly before it became public. German prosecutors have also saidthat Mr Winterkorn may have been aware of the problems earlier than he admitted.

Undercover officer fired over relationship,"Det Con Jim Boyling worked for the now-disbanded Special Demonstrations Squad A former undercover police officer has been sacked from the Met after having a sexual relationship with a woman in a campaign group he was targeting. Det Con Jim Boyling, who worked for the Special Demonstrations Squad (SDS), was found guilty of gross misconduct. Using the name Sutton he infiltrated the campaign group Reclaim The Streets and had relationships with three women. Det Con Boyling has accused Scotland Yard of having ""selective amnesia"" about what he had previously told them. It is the first time such a finding has been made in relation to an undercover officer. The Met said his actions had been ""unacceptable"". This video can not be played 'Rosa' says her sense of reality has been taken away from her (picture posed by model) Posing as a fellow anti-roads protester, the officer had relationships with women in the group. When the third woman, known only as Rosa for legal reasons, tracked him down in 2001 they resumed the relationship and the officer subsequently revealed his true identity. They married and had two children but she left him six years later, accusing the officer of not only tricking her into the first relationship, but psychologically manipulating her into getting back together and forming a family. Det Con Boyling used the name Jim Sutton when he infiltrated the anti-roads campaign group During the week-long disciplinary hearing, a panel heard allegations the officer had begun a sexual relationship with Rosa ""without authorisation and without a policing purpose"". The panel ruled this amounted to gross misconduct. It further ruled the officer had failed to disclose the relationship to his superiors and he broke strict police rules by admitting to Rosa he was an undercover officer. ""Undercover policing is an important and lawful tactic, but it must never be abused,"" Deputy Assistant Commissioner Richard Martin said. This video can not be played Environmental campaigner ""Monica"" said she was tricked into a sexual relationship with Det Con Boyling Det Con Boyling, who was an officer for 30 years, said: ""The disciplinary charge from the Met specifies that I had a relationship which constituted misconduct because it was 'without a police purpose'. ""The position of the Met appears to be that a relationship entered into as an operational tactic is acceptable, but a genuine one resulting in marriage and children constitutes misconduct."" He said he used his real name and registered his occupation as a police officer on the marriage certificate and both birth certificates, and that Rosa knew he had worked undercover. He also made a written declaration of his marriage to the Met's vetting unit. ""The Met does a good line in selective amnesia, as indeed they do in selective disclosure,"" he added. Det Con Boyling said he did not contest the Met disciplinary hearing because he could not afford to stay in London during the proceedings, and did not wish to drag former colleagues and his ex-wife through the process. However, he said he would give evidence to the public inquiry into undercover policing. The Metropolitan Police has already made an unreserved apology to Rosa and 11 other women who had relationships with undercover officers and has paid out substantial sums in settlements to the women.

Declaration times and what to watch for,"Will Jeremy Corbyn be feasting on success? The local council elections in England are being held in predominantly Labour-held areas. The party holds more than half the seats that are being contested. So with the two main parties neck and neck in national polls, you would expect Labour to win more seats given that they are playing on home turf. But there is still room for improvement. In 2014 - the last time many of the seats were contested - the party missed out on winning some of its target councils because of a UKIP surge - in what was its second best local election result. The Projected National Share of the Vote - which seeks to calculate the share of the vote as though the whole nation had gone to the polls, and not just in the contested council areas - from 2014 put Labour at 31%, two points ahead of the Conservatives with UKIP on 17%. UKIP gained 161 seats in 2014 but because of boundary changes the party is defending only 126 of them now. But an analysis by election gurus Rallings and Thrasher - who have studied the result of local council by-elections in eyes-glazing-over detail - suggest the party could lose around 125 of these. Yes, that's right - almost all of them. So a bad night for UKIP seems likely. Where their votes go, however, will be interesting. There are Election 2018 special programmes from 23:45 BST on BBC One, continuing on the BBC News Channel and then on BBC Two for most of Friday afternoon. BBC News Online has rolling coverage as all the results come in, with all the reaction and analysis as it happens onBBC Election Live On radio there will also be full coverage on BBC Radio 5live and on BBC local radio At the general election last year, a collapsing UKIP vote didn't translate in to an across-the-board boost for the Conservatives. So areas to watch out for include Dudley, the black country council where Labour is the largest party but the second-placed Conservatives are in control with the help of the seven UKIP councillors who hold the balance of power. Nearly seven out of 10 voters there backed Brexit in the referendum. So this is a good test of whether the Conservatives can sweep up ex-UKIP votes or whether a mixture of local issues and any discontent at how Brexit is being handled by the government can help Labour. In Basildon and Peterborough the Conservatives seem more confident of benefiting from a UKIP retreat, and gains here could potentially mask overall losses nationally. The Conservatives have a fight on their hands holding onto Wandsworth Calderdale in Yorkshire provides a slightly different test. Again, it's a Leave area. Labour is the largest party in a hung council and is hoping to take overall control. In 2017, the parliamentary seats saw a swing to Labour. So if the party fails to improve this may be a sign that, outside London, support for the party is waning and not building since its extraordinary general election performance. Equally, it's a test for the Conservatives, too. After a disastrous general election campaign, can they show progress in areas that would be highly desirable for them to win back if they hope to regain a parliamentary majority? And another clue to the relative standing of the two parties in the urban areas in the south of England will be the outcome of the Tory/Labour dogfights in Swindon and Plymouth. London was different in 2014 - Labour won more than half of the council seats in the capital, and gained the highest share of the vote at 43%. And it's different now. Six out of 10 voters in London voted to remain in the EU. Even though the Labour frontbench often restates its respect for the referendum result, in many parts of the city the party has been more successful than the pro-EU Lib Dems at picking up Remain votes. So Labour expects to do even better than 2014 - but has had trouble managing expectations. London Mayor Sadiq Khan has confidently talked about there being ""no no-go areas"" for Labour in London now. There are special circumstances in Conservative-controlled Kensington and Chelsea, following the Grenfell disaster. Elsewhere, the result in Barnet could indicate whether the anti-Semitism row has hurt Labour electorally. Labour hopes to take it from the Conservatives. There are about 50,000 Jewish voters in this north London borough and in some wards how they cast their ballots could be decisive. Labour has also been hopeful of taking Wandsworth in south London from the Conservatives for the first time in four decades. The UKIP leader says he will be happy with between 5% and 7% of the vote They are hoping the 11% of the electorate that are EU citizens will bother to vote, and vote Labour as a protest against how the government has handled citizens' rights. It's quite an ask and Labour would require around an 8% swing to take the borough. So if they win it's a sign of a very good night for Labour in London - and that a Jeremy Corbyn-led party can win in areas that even Tony Blair at the height of his popularity couldn't conquer. But retaining Wandsworth doesn't mean it will be a good night for the Conservatives. A genuine recovery would see them not just holding territory but winning back councils such as Croydon that were lost in 2014. And the eminent psephologist Sir John Curtice believes that the government's handling of Windrush could adversely affect Conservative performance in the capital. Unlike Labour, and perhaps sensibly, the Lib Dems have been managing expectations. Party leader Sir Vince Cable told me that he hopes to pick up ""one or two councils"" and simply hopes the worst is over for his party. The two councils would be Kingston and Richmond in south-west London, former Lib Dem strongholds where voters backed Remain in the referendum... although the party insists it has been talking more about the bins than Brexit on the doorstep. But they also have to defend their control in nearby Sutton - one of the few areas of London where a majority of voters backed Leave. Outside London, Woking in Surrey seems their best prospect in a head-to-head battle with the Conservatives. They don't expect to take control of councils but with around one in 12 voters backing the Green Party in the London-wide assembly elections in 2016 they are hopeful of at least gaining more seats across the capital. Outside London, some contests are likely to be genuinely dominated by local issues - will Labour lose out in Birmingham, for example, where there has been a bitter bin dispute? And will the tree-felling frenzy in Sheffield allow the party's opponents to put down roots? There will be a dizzying amount of spin from the parties. Well there are different measures but Rallings and Thrasher's study of recent council by-elections suggest that if Labour gains more than 200 council seats the party is outperforming recent results. Losing more than 75 seats wouldn't be great for the Conservatives. The Lib Dems tend to poll better in local contests than nationally and have done reasonably well in council by-elections so to perform at trend they'd need about 30 gains. And, frankly, for UKIP the bar is low. Just holding on to any of their gains from 2014 would at least suggest the party is still with us.

Breast screen helpline inundated by calls,"Breast cancer screening is offered once every three years to women aged 50 to 70 More than 8,000 calls have been made to a helpline since it was revealed that450,000 women were not invited to routine breast cancer screeningdue to a computer error. Public Health England says it was not aware of a national problem with the screening programme until January. But the BBC understands that two NHS trusts in England raised concerns about IT issues as early as March 2017. They were told the problems were a local - not national - matter. It is understood the IT problem related to an algorithm used to decide the order in which to send letters to women of different ages. The national screening error, which dates back to 2009, meant women aged 68 to 71 were not sent letters inviting them to their final screening appointment. Breast cancer screening is currently offered once every three years to women aged 50 to 70 in the UK. How many lives does breast screening save? Signs of breast cancer explained, using lemons Breast size dissatisfaction 'affects self-examination' Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said that up to 270 lives may have been cut short because of the mistake. The 309,000 women affected - those who are still alive - would be contacted by letter by the end of May with the offer of catch-up mammograms, he said. Breast cancer survivors are demanding answers and experts are asking why the error was not spotted sooner, as cancer charities are being inundated with calls. This video can not be played Helen Jarvis experienced problems with the helpline Breast Cancer Care said its helpline had received four times its usual number of calls in one day. Clinical director Dr Emma Pennery said women contacting them were feeling ""angry and confused"". ""Many are anxiously playing a waiting game until the letters arrive, not knowing if they've been affected. ""Others are extremely worried about when their letters will arrive and how long it will take to get screened."" Cancer experts have cautioned that there are pros and cons to screening - not all cancers are picked up by screening and sometimes those picked up do not need to be treated. If you think you may be affected: call the breast screening helpline number 0800 169 2692 go theNHS Choices website,externalfor more information you should receive a letter by the end of May Helen Baczkowska's mother Ann died of breast cancer in 2014, aged 74, after being diagnosed in 2012. She was registered with a GP but had not had a mammogram for several years. Helen fears she may have been one of those overlooked by the screening programme: ""I remember having conversations with her where she said, 'you know what, I haven't been called for a screening for some time', and there was just a question in her mind as to why she hadn't been called, and then of course she discovered a lump herself. ""We think she may have tried to inquire, but didn't really know who to speak to as it didn't come through the GP, it's a separate system. ""You never know with someone's cancer whether it could have been very aggressive anyway. There are so many variables. ""It's hard to lose somebody and to have tried to have moved on through your grief and then have it all brought back."" Lee Towsey's mother died of breast cancer in 2012, aged 70, having found a lump. She did not have a mammogram around the time that she should have done. Mr Towsey feels that the whole screening process was badly organised. He said: ""I don't know where to take it from here, but I need to talk to my family. ""I mean, it's outrageous, it's disgusting, and I think that someone needs to resign, to be honest. ""It's like it doesn't matter that 270 women died, it just doesn't matter. Who cares?"" Sara Hiom, director of early diagnosis at Cancer Research UK, said the women affected would have missed ""the final of what could have been seven rounds of screening"". ""If we assume that they attended every other screening round that they would have been invited to from the age of around 50, then they have at least had several opportunities to have any breast cancer diagnosed earlier."" A recent report on the NHS found that the number of women who accepted invitations to breast screenings had fallen to 71%, a 10-year low. The Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) has questioned why health chiefs did not raise any alarms. Public Health England spotted the issue in January while analysing data from the Age X trial - which was testing the idea of screening women up to the age of 73. Breast screening: Is the NHS programme working? Breast screening: What went wrong? Breast screening: For and against Why isn't breast cancer screening totally reliable? The BBC understands an error led to women in the control group wrongly being offered screenings up until their 70th birthday, rather than their 71st. Dr Jenny Harries, deputy medical director of Public Health England, toldBBC Radio 4's Today programme:""There are a number of organisations involved in this and I think we are all - Public Health England, the NHS, NHS Digital, the Department of Health - devastated by this. ""We have a screening programme that is world-class. ""We wouldn't want any lives to be shortened.

'Mystery pooper' unmasked as school chief,"Police say they have got to the bottom of the ""mystery pooper"" investigation Police hunting a suspect who relieved himself on school grounds ""on a daily basis"" in the US state of New Jersey have arrested a top education official. Kenilworth school superintendent Thomas Tramaglini, 42, was detained after investigators set up a sting operation to snare the ""mystery pooper"". Police were called after students complained of frequent excrement near their school running track and field. Mr Tramaglini is charged with lewdness, littering and defecating in public. In a statement,external, the Holmdel Township Police Department said they opened an investigation after high school staff and sports coaches reported ""they were finding human faeces, on or near the area of the High School track / football field on a daily basis"". According to local media, the superintendent lives about three miles (4.8km) from the Holmdel High School in Monmouth County, 40 miles from New York City. On Monday at 05:50 local time (09:50 GMT), officers approached the superintendent while he was running at the school track, the scene of the alleged crime. Mr Tramaglini, who earns nearly $150,000 (Â£110,000) per year as head of the local education authority, was arrested. Police officers said they had just observed him in the act. Vito Gagliardi, a lawyer for the school board, told APP.com that Mr Tramaglini has been ""highly regarded"" during his three years as head of the local schools. Allow Facebook content?

""Leaves can only be without pay in the face of indictments or tenure charges, as a matter of state law."" It is unclear why Mr Tramaglini allegedly did not use toilet facilities. On Facebook, local residents speculated on his potential motive, with some arguing he should not be punished unless his intent was malicious. Others questioned whether Mr Tramaglini, if guilty, could have a condition that left him unable to restrain his bowel movements.

Final voters cast ballots in local elections,"There is less than an hour to go for people to vote in council and mayoral elections across England. Polling stations, which opened at 07:00 BST, will close at 22:00 BST. Elections are being held in 150 local authorities, spanning metropolitan and district councils, unitary authorities and London boroughs. Watford, Hackney, Newham, Lewisham and Tower Hamlets will elect mayors while the first-ever mayor for the Sheffield City Region will also be chosen. There have been reports of some people being prevented from voting after turning up without the required identity documents, in the five areas which are trialling voter ID. Rolling updates: Voters go to polls How to cast your vote on polling day West Tyrone by-election voting under way There are no local elections in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. However, a parliamentary by-election for the Westminster seat of West Tyrone is taking place. The council polls, in which 4,371 seats are being contested, are the first England-wide test of electoral opinion since last year's general election.     The leaders of the four parties with MPs in England have all voted. Conservative leader Theresa May and her husband Philip voted at Westminster's Methodist Hall A primary school in Holloway, north London, served as a polling station for the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable voted at his local station in Twickenham Jonathan Bartley, Green Party co-leader, cast his vote in Lambeth, south London Swindon, Woking, Watford, Gosport and Bromley have been running the voter ID trials  - there are full detailson the UK government website,externalabout which ID is required in each of the pilot areas. One Bromley councillor said on Twitter that five people had been unable to vote and that long delays were putting more off. And in Woking, a councillor said a voter was turned away because his form of ID, a Surrey County Council document with his picture on it, was not accepted. The prime minister's spokesman said all eligible voters in those areas had been told they needed to bring a form of ID. He said: ""The vast majority of people are casting their vote without a problem. ""This is a pilot, an evidence-based approach, and obviously we will consider the pilot and decide the best way to go forward."" What can you not do in a polling station? How the BBC reports polling day Everyone else is able to vote as usual - just by telling the staff in the polling station their name and address - and will not need to take their polling card or other form of identity with them.

Polls close in English local elections,"This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: ""There's much more to come and it's going to get even better"" Jeremy Corbyn has said Labour achieved ""solid"" English local election results despite not making big gains. The party failed to take several targets from the Tories, including Wandsworth, but won back Plymouth and became the largest party in Trafford. Theresa May praised Tory councillors after winning Barnet, Basildon and Peterborough. The party gained from a collapse in UKIP's vote. The BBC's projected national vote share puts both parties on 35%. Polling expert Professor Sir John Curtice told the BBC it was ""a draw"", so far as both parties' national performance was concerned. The Lib Dems are on 16% according the BBC estimate, which uses the results of key wards to estimate what a Britain-wide vote would have been. Recap: How the election results unfolded Sir John Curtice: How important was Brexit? UKIP official compares party to the Black Death The final council to be declared was Tower Hamlets, which was gained by Labour from no overall control. Across the 150 council elections, Labour won 2,350 seats, up 77, the Conservatives won 1,332, down 33, the Lib Dems won 536, up 75, the Greens won 39, up eight and UKIP won three, down 123. The BBC estimate, based on 800 key wards, puts turnout at 36%, the same as in these wards four years ago. The Conservativesgained the London council of Barnetfrom no overall control, and held their flagship London councils of Westminster and Wandsworth. They also won Basildon and Peterborough, which had both also been under no overall control. But they havelost control of their northern flagship Trafford Councilafter 14 years of Conservative rule. Labour had high hopes for the night, and havewon Plymouth from the Toriesand gained Kirklees from no overall control butlost Nuneaton and BedworthandDerby. The Lib Dems have gained four councils, winning neighbouringKingston-upon-ThamesandRichmond-upon-Thamesin Greater London andSouth Cambridgeshirefrom the Tories andThree Riversfrom no overall control. The Greenshave gained seats- taking some from Labour in Sheffield and from the Tories in Richmond upon Thames. UKIP, which performed strongly last time most of the seats were fought in 2014,has seen its vote collapse. It had just three councillors elected, after losing 123. Sinn FÃ©inhas won the Westminster by-election in West Tyrone. Labour MP Dan Jarvis has beenelected mayor of the Sheffield City Region. This video can not be played Theresa May hails Tory campaigners in Wandsworth The Conservatives held on to their flagship London councils, gained control of Redditch from Labour and Barnet, Basildon and Peterborough, which had been under no overall control. But they have lost control of Trafford in Greater Manchester, a key northern stronghold, where Labour is now the largest party, Plymouth, and Mole Valley, Surrey - as well as losing two London councils to the Lib Dems. According to the BBC's projected national vote share, the party is three points down on what it achieved in 2017's county council elections but, after eight years in government, it is better than its performance in any of the local elections held between 2012 and 2014 and in 2016. Prime Minister Theresa May visited Wandsworth on Friday morning - one of the Conservative's key London councils which the party held, despite losing eight seats. She said: ""Labour thought they could take control, this was one of their top targets and they threw everything at it, but they failed."" She said the party ""won't take anything for granted"" and would ""build on this success for the future"". Party chairman Brandon Lewis acknowledged some disappointments, but told BBC Breakfast that voters had chosen the Tories after seeing ""good, clear and strong leadership"" from the prime minister. Labour did pick up a seat in the Tory stronghold of Kensington and Chelsea Council, but the Conservatives retained control, despite criticism of their handling of the Grenfell Tower disaster. Tory leader of the council, Elizabeth Campbell, said they needed to ""rebuild trust"". Labour had hoped to take control of Wandsworth Labour was defending the most seats - more than 2,200 - and had talked up its prospects in London, where it made gains in last year's general election. The party gained control of Plymouth from the Conservatives as well as Kirklees, but lost control of two Midlands councils - Derby and Nuneaton and Bedworth - to no overall control. Its hopes of seizing control of Wandsworth and Westminster proved unfounded while the party lost ground in Hillingdon. Labour's projected national vote share - at 35% - is its best such performance since 2012 and puts it neck and neck with the Conservatives - but in 2013, 2014 and 2016 it was estimated to be narrowly ahead of the Tories. Leader Jeremy Corbyn said his party's win in Plymouth was a ""fantastic result"" and ""a sign that Labour is back in this part of Britain"". Of the party's performance more widely, he said ""obviously I'm disappointed at any places where we lost a bit of ground"" but described it as a ""solid set of results"" which left the party ""well placed to fight and win the next general election"". Deputy leader Tom Watson said Labour now had more councillors in London than at any time since the 1970s. Shadow Local Government Secretary Andrew Gwynne said he believed the anti-Semitism row had had an impact on the result in Barnet, north London, which the Tories took back from no overall control. Backbencher Jess Phillips said the party had to look at what had gone wrong in white working class areas in northern England while Chuka Umunna called for an election ""post-mortem"" to look at why expected gains hadn't materialised. Mr Umunna said the government was ""divided and incompetent"" yet Labour had not seen ""the big win in Wandsworth or Kensington that was expected"". Victory proved sweet for the Liberal Democrats in Richmond-upon-Thames The Lib Dems have won back control of Kingston-upon-Thames, in south-west London, which they lost to the Tories four years ago, after taking neighbouring Richmond - both areas had a large majority in favour of remaining in the EU. The party has also gained control of Three Rivers, south-west Hertfordshire, which had been under no overall control and has won South Cambridgeshire from the Tories. The party also withstood a strong Conservative challenge to hold onto Sutton in south-west London - while it picked up nine seats in Kingston-upon-Hull. Professor Sir John Curtice said the party's 16% projected national vote share was an improvement on its performances between 2013 and 2015 - but well down on the 25% or so it would achieve before it entered the coalition government in 2010. Party leader Sir Vince Cable hailed the result in Richmond: ""It's certainly the beginning of the comeback of the Lib Dems. It's not going to happen overnight - Rome wasn't built in a day. ""Morale is now very high. We have demonstrated that we can win when we are focused and we can only build on that."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The Greens have made overall gains, including taking two seats off Labour in Sheffield, where the Labour-run council has been engulfed in a row over the felling of thousands of trees. They also took seats from the Conservatives in the London borough of Richmond-upon-Thames and added two new councillors in Trafford and one in Worcester. Greens co-leader Caroline Lucas told the BBC: ""I think the Greens have had a really good night and... even with a fraction of the resources, a fraction of the media time when people see Greens on the ground they like what they see and they elect more Greens. And that's what we are seeing from Richmond to Greater Manchester to the Midlands. We've had some great results."" But she acknowledged she was ""incredibly disappointed"" to lose five of the Greens' 10 seats on Norwich Council, blaming a ""bit of a Corbyn surge"" among younger voters.     The Eurosceptic party has, as predicted, haemorrhaged support, losing nearly all of the council seats it won in 2014, when it broke through into local government for the first time. It put up candidates in only 540 seats compared with 2,193 in 2014, lost all ten seats it contested in Basildon, five in Thurrock and seven in Dudley. So far they have lost more than 100 seats and won two - including unseating Labour's council leader in Derby. Former deputy chair Suzanne Evans said the fact it had taken two seats in Derby was a sign it could still ""put the cat among the pigeons"". Meanwhile its general secretary, Paul Oakley, compared UKIP to the Black Death and said the party ""not all over at all"". ""Think of the Black Death in the Middle Ages. It comes along and it causes disruption and then it goes dormant, and that's exactly what we are going to do. Our time isn't finished because Brexit is being betrayed."" By BBC Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg They seem stuck with each other - so close, in fact, that our projected national share of the vote from the results would mean that, in a hypothetical general election tomorrow, the two main Westminster parties would receive exactly the same levels of public support. For reasons we've discussed at length overnight and in recent days, we have to be careful about directly transposing what happened on Thursday into a theoretical nationwide election. But while in one sense not very much happened in the local election - not very many councils and seats changed hands and neither of the main parties have (with a couple of hours to go) made dramatic strides - something important did happen. Voters opted again for roughly the status quo, underlining the trends that we saw developing at the general election as the political parties grappled with a new landscape after the referendum. Read Laura's blog This video can not be played Professor Sir John Curtice on three things we learnt from the local election results Polling expert Professor Sir John Curtice said the Tories were performing relatively well in areas with a substantial Leave vote in the 2016 referendum, where they are picking up votes from UKIP, which did not stand candidates in many areas, while Labour were performing better in places where the Remain vote was stronger and with a higher proportion of younger voters. In addition to the council polls, there have been a series of mayoral elections in London boroughs. Labour mayors were elected in Hackney, Lewisham, Newham and Tower Hamlets - while in Watford, the Lib Dem candidate was elected. Labour MP Dan Jarvis has been elected mayor for the Sheffield City Region. There are no local elections in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. However, a parliamentary by-election for the Westminster seat of West Tyrone took place, with Sinn Fein retaining it.

Rewind to November 2017 and Arsalan was a member of a WhatsApp group with other people in the university's Bracton Law Society But the tone of the messages turned nasty - and Arsalan decided to post some of them to Facebook. They were shared thousands of times. The messages were sent between members of the Bracton Law Society ""It got too much for me so I just left the group chat and forwarded the messages to some of my [non-university] friends. ""I told them about everything that had happened and they were horrified. Arsalan's friends advised him to complain to Exeter University, but he says he just didn't get round to it immediately. ""I left it on the back burner for a while because I had essays to write, it was a busy time."" The next step was when Arsalan showed the messages to some of his university friends. He said they were horrified by what they saw: ""We talked about going through the university but one of my friends had had a far worse situation and it was a five-month investigation and an outcome that was incredibly vague. ""I've always been a massive advocate of freedom of speech [but] there is also an integrity you need to have as someone who wants to practise in the legal field. ""You should know the consequences of the statements you're making."" As well as being racist, sexist and bigoted, one of the messages targeted someone who'd been stabbed at university. ""Ignorant jokes are one thing, and genuinely appearing to have some form of prejudice towards people of colour is a total other thing."" This excerpt from the group chat appeared to reference the dark comedy film Four Lions After the investigation was finished an email was sent to students and staff by university officials. It explained expulsions, suspensions and other sanctions had been used. But there was no comment on how many people had been expelled. Arsalan says he thinks the investigation was handled well. ""I believe it was, because what if in the future my kid goes for an interview with a law firm and sits opposite one of those individuals? ""Regardless of how much they say they don't hold those views, those prejudices are still there - I've seen it first hand.

"Twitter tells users to change passwordsA glitch exposed some passwords to staff on the company's internal network, the social network says.4m5 minutes agoBusiness","Passwords that should have been scrambled were exposed on Twitter's network Twitter's 330 million users are being urged to change their passwords after some were exposed in plain text on its internal network. An error in the way the passwords were handled meant some were stored in easily readable form, said Twitter. The passwords should have been put through a procedure called ""hashing"" making them very difficult to read. Security experts said the way Twitter handled the potential breach was ""encouraging"". The bug caused the passwords to be stored on an internal computer log before the hashing process was completed. In a blog,the social network said once the mistake was uncovered,externalit carried out an internal investigation which found no indication passwords were stolen or misused by insiders. However, it still urged all users to consider changing their passwords ""out of an abundance of caution"". Twitter did not say how many passwords were affected but it is understood the number was ""substantial"" and that they were exposed for ""several months"". Twitter discovered the bug a few weeks ago and has reported it to some regulators, an insider told Reuters. Chief executive Jack Dorsey tweeted to say the ""bug"" had been fixed.

Independent security expert Graham Cluley said: ""It's quite encouraging that Twitter both found the problem internally, and informed its users quickly and transparently. ""Something similar just happened to Github and I wonder if Twitter's discovery was caused by them asking: 'Hey, see that Github problem? Do you think something like that could happen to us?'."" Users receive a warning message when logging in to Twitter Security expert Per Thorsheim, who regularly advises firms about the best password practices, said Twitter should be ""applauded for its transparency"". ""The problem they discovered is known since the dawn of logins with passwords,"" he told the BBC. ""The chance of passwords (or failed passwords) getting logged, in plain text logs available for staff or in worst case, complete strangers, is well known."" Troy Hunt, who runs the Have I Been Pwned website, which logs breaches, said the error was not something that would worry him because there was no indication that the login passwords were seen outside the company. Mr Hunt added: ""We've certainly seen many precedents of simply flaws resulting in data breaches. ""The Red Cross Blood Service in Australia used an outsourcing provider who inadvertently published their entire database to a public web server resulting in Australia's largest ever data breach,"" he said. All three experts urged users to act on Twitter's advice and change their password. Mr Cluley said enabling two-factor authentication that adds another ID check to login attempts would help ""harden"" accounts.

Ex-VW boss charged over diesel scandalMartin Winterkorn is accused by US prosecutors of conspiring to mislead regulators.21m21 minutes agoBusiness,"Former VW chief Martin Winterkorn has been charged by US authorities Former Volkswagen chief executive Martin Winterkorn has been charged by US prosecutors in Detroit over the diesel emissions scandal. He has been accused of conspiring to mislead regulators about the German car maker's efforts to cheat the emissions tests of its diesel-fuelled vehicles. Charges filed in March were revealed on Thursday, adding Mr Winterkorn to the list of accused former VW executives. VW said it was cooperating with US probes and declined to comment further. US Attorney General Jeff Sessions said the indictment showed that Volkswagen's scheme to cheat its legal requirements went ""all the way to the top"". Volkswagen: The scandal explained Emissions cheat bill hits $30bn Mr Winterkorn, 70, resigned soon after the scandal over polluting vehicles in the US erupted in September 2015. He is the ninth person to be hit with US criminal charges connected to the emissions cheating scandal. Two have pleaded guilty and are serving time in prison. Despite a bill of more than $30bn in fines and buying back cars, as well as the indictment of several mid-level executives, it always seemed like the man at the top of Volkswagen would escape prosecution. Martin Winterkorn, who was in charge of the world's largest car maker during the period it installed cheat devices on millions of vehicles, has always maintained that he reported the illegal activity to authorities soon after becoming aware of it. But in an unprecedented filing against an overseas business leader, a federal grand jury in Michigan charged Mr Winterkorn with making ""false representations to regulators and the public"" about the emission levels of VW vehicles. He is already in legal trouble in Stuttgart, where VW investors claim he sat on information of the scandal, which wiped billions off the company's market value, for more than a year. But even if found guilty by US authorities, it's unlikely Mr Winterkorn, who resigned soon after the scandal broke in 2015, will ever see the inside of a US courtroom, much less prison, as Germany does not extradite its citizens. Volkswagen pleaded guilty in March 2017 to criminal charges that it deceived US regulatory agencies, including the Environmental Protection Agency and the California Air Resources Board, by installing so-called software defeat devices in diesel vehicles emissions control systems. The devices, which allowed vehicles to perform better in test conditions than they did on the road, were installed on almost 600,000 vehicles sold in the US from 2009 though 2015 and millions more globally. They came to light after a study of emissions by researchers at West Virginia University. The scandal has sparked investigations in Germany and other countries. US prosecutors say Mr Winterkorn was informed of the issue as early as May 2014 and was present at a July 2015 meeting when executives agreed to deflect questions from regulators with excuses such as ""irregularities"". VW in 2016 said,externalthat it did not know if participants at that meeting understood that the changes to the software violated US law. The firm on Thursday said: ""Volkswagen continues to cooperate with investigations by the Department of Justice into the conduct of individuals. It would not be appropriate to comment on individual cases."" Mr Winterkorn, who became chief executive in 2007, has said he was unaware of the issue until shortly before it became public. German prosecutors have also saidthat Mr Winterkorn may have been aware of the problems earlier than he admitted.

Trump: No campaign cash paid to Daniels,"President Donald Trump has denied money used to buy a porn star's silence came from election campaign funds. He admitted, in a series of tweets, that lawyer Michael Cohen had paid off Stormy Daniels during the campaign and that he was reimbursed. It was the first time the president has referred directly to the payment, although he remains adamant there was no affair with Ms Daniels. Use of campaign funds would be a violation of federal law. Earlier, his legal aide Rudy Giuliani had said the money was Mr Trump's personal cash. Should Trump be worried about Stormy Daniels? The president and the porn star: Why this matters The president fired off three tweets on Thursday morning, focusing on the reimbursement and a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) with Daniels.

Mr Trump's argument appears to be that the NDA was a typical agreement entered into by celebrities and therefore not an election-related matter. This could be crucial in determining whether the $130,000 (Â£95,650) paid to Ms Daniels was legal. The actress says she had an affair with Mr Trump in 2006 and she slept with him once. In a particularly feisty White House daily news conference on Thursday, press secretary Sarah Sanders was asked when she became aware that Mr Trump had repaid Mr Cohen the money. ""The first awareness I had was during the [Giuliani] interview last night,"" she said. This video can not be played On 5 April Donald Trump said ""I don't know"" about a payment to Stormy Daniels When asked by reporters a month ago if he knew about the payment to Ms Daniels, Mr Trump said: ""No."" When asked why the payment was given to Ms Daniels, he added: ""You'll have to ask Michael Cohen."" The conflicting statements Speaking on Fox TV last week, Mr Trump suggested some knowledge of the matter in admitting Mr Cohen had represented him during the ""crazy Stormy Daniels deal"", but he did not go into specifics. Mr Cohen, for his part,told the New York Times in February,external: ""Neither the Trump Organization nor the Trump campaign was a party to the transaction with Ms Clifford, and neither reimbursed me for the payment, either directly or indirectly."" How this relates to any alleged personal repayments by Mr Trump is unclear. Mr Cohen is facing a criminal investigation. FBI agents searched his home and office in New York recently in relation to the NDA. By Anthony Zurcher, senior North America correspondent Donald Trump's April assertion that he had no idea where Michael Cohen found the money to secure Stormy Daniels' silence seems, to borrow a phrase from Nixon administration press secretary Ron Ziegler, ""no longer operative"". White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders stated in March that the president had ""no knowledge of any payments"". Now she's saying she can't comment on the situation. Michael Cohen - before he cited the Fifth Amendment in court to avoid self-incriminating testimony - insisted that he made the Daniels payment out of his own pocket. Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, a new arrival on the president's personal legal team, says Mr Trump reimbursed Mr Cohen for the payment over the course of 2017 and was tasked with handling ""things like this"". Someone has lied or is lying to protect Donald Trump. The questions are who - and why. Michael Avenatti, Daniels' lawyer, says his client has evidence that will prove the veracity of their claims. Mr Trump, in his tweets, promises a lawsuit to enforce Daniels' silence about what he calls ""false and extortionist accusations"". This White House storm shows no signs of ending anytime soon. The big question at heart of Stormy Daniels saga This video can not be played White House weighs in on Stormy Daniels US federal law restricts how much individuals and organisations can contribute to campaign financing, and there are also strict regulations on the disclosure of the financing. The key question may be whether the money was used to prevent Mr Trump's reputation being harmed during the campaign, and therefore be deemed as related to the election. Legal expert Lawrence Noble told the Washington Post,external: ""If the purpose of this was to stop [Daniels] from hurting the campaign, then what you have is Cohen made a loan to the campaign."" The $130,000 would exceed the amount an individual can donate to a presidential campaign. Any repayment by the Trump campaign would violate the law. But presidential candidates are allowed to contribute an unlimited amount to their own campaign. Mr Trump may be arguing that the personal nature of the repayment makes it legal. If the $130,000 were deemed to have been a loan to Mr Cohen, the president would only have had to disclose the repayment to the Federal Election Commission if it were an election-related expense. There is no mention of any debt to Mr Cohen on Mr Trump's personal financial disclosure form from June 2017. Former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani recently joined Mr Trump's legal team and had earlier been interviewed by Sean Hannity on Fox News, surprising many with his comments. He was the first to say Mr Trump repaid the money. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Children as young as 11 abusing Xanax drug,"The US-style bar-shaped version of the drug is the form that is most commonly traded among teenagers - but there are many counterfeit versions Children as young as 11 are being treated for abusing the anxiety drug Xanax, the BBC has found. Drugs charity Addaction said it was also aware of 13-year-olds ""dealing"" the tranquiliser on school premises. The BBC has seen a number of letters from head teachers to parents raising concerns over increasing abuse of prescription medications. One teacher said he feared pupils had made an assumption that taking Xanax was safer than using illegal drugs. Xanax, the brand name for the drug Alprazolam, is used to treat anxiety and panic attacks. It is widely prescribed in the US and can be obtained on private prescription in the UK. But among some teenagers and young adults in Britain it is increasingly being abused. The anxiety drug putting lives at risk Teens 'buying anxiety drug Xanax on social media' Xanax drug sold on social media found to be fake To gain an idea of the scale of Xanax abuse, the BBC sent a freedom of information request to six ambulance services about its call-outs to Xanax ingestion incidents where the patient was aged under 18. The North East Ambulance Service was the service that provided the most comprehensive details about when Xanax had been ingested - other services recorded all incidents involving the family name of the drug, benzodiazepine - and it said that in 2017 it had attended 240 call-outs for Xanax abuse by children aged between 11 and 18. Two of the cases last year had been for 11-year-old and there had also been cases recorded in 2014 and 2016 for children of that age. Nick Lind, deputy head of Redland Green School in Bristol, said that, over the last 18 months, he had written several letters to parents about Xanax abuse. He said he was concerned that the abuse of prescription medication had become a trend, and that pupils believed it was ""a safe alternative to illegal drugs"", obtaining supplies mainly from the dark web. ""Students are finding out that that's the drug that's available, they've seen other people using it. Sometimes it's mentioned, because it is an anti-depressant and an anti-anxiety drug. ""Because it's seen as a prescription drug and therefore not seen necessarily by some people as dangerous because it is prescription, they don't understand the risks. They think it's a safe way of getting into drugs."" And he said that he had heard various reason why pupils were taking the drug as a form of self-medication. ""They know the background of Xanax is as an anti-depressant, and they think they can use it when they're building up for exam stress or through difficult times in their lives."" The official form of Xanax is only available on private prescription in the UK to treat anxiety Kerry Robinson, a paediatrician at London's Whittington Hospital, said she had treated children aged under 16 for Xanax abuse. ""The cases that I've seen it's not a recreational party drug,"" she said. ""Young people have taken it during the school day, then stumbled into their next lesson and someone has picked up that things are not right."" She said symptoms included slurred speech, unsteadiness, and looking drunk, but without the lack of inhibition associated with alcohol. Addaction said it was ""concerned"" by the number of teenagers it was helping that had addiction problems related to the drug. Neil Coles, from Addaction, said that he and his colleagues were providing advice and support to a number of children as young as 13 caught using and ""dealing"" Xanax. He said: ""I don't think a lot of young people realise what Xanax is. They don't realise that it's a benzodiazepine. ""They don't realise that your tolerance builds to it very, very fast. They don't realise that if you mix it with alcohol it's problematic. ""So we're seeing a lot of young people who don't realise the dosage, they're taking far too much, collapsing on school premises, and therefore having to be taken to hospitals."" Mr Coles said teenagers were also buying the raw ingredients from the dark web to produce their own version of the drug. That means many other teenagers fail to realise that the Xanax they are buying is not of pharmacy grade and is instead counterfeit, he added. One 17-year-old, who wished to remain anonymous, said he started taking Xanax at 14 to calm his anxiety. He said he had mixed the drug with alcohol, and ended up in hospital ""a couple of times"". He said: ""People need to be careful, because you can take one bar and be feeling absolutely fine, and then they can take another one and then two days later wake up in a police cell or hospital with absolutely no memory of what happened."" ABBC Three investigation into Xanaxfound that, last year, Border Force officers seized more 50kg of the powder form of the drug - enough to make 25 million typical-sized pills containing 2mg each. A Home Office statement said firm action was being taken ""to prevent the harms caused by drugs"". It added: ""Law enforcement agencies continue to work with internet providers to shut down UK-based websites found to be selling these drugs illegally.""

Academy expels Cosby and Polanski,"Bill Cosby and Roman Polanski have been expelled from the US Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. The academy - which runs the Oscars - said this was done in accordance with its standards of conduct. TV star Cosby was convicted of sexual assault last month. Oscar-winning director Polanski admitted unlawful sex with a 13-year-old girl in 1977. Producer Harvey Weinstein was kicked out last year, following numerous allegations of sexual assault. Less than a year after the downfall of the producer the #MeToo movement is catching up with other men who abused their power, the BBC's James Cook in Los Angeles reports. Neither Cosby nor Polanski have publicly reacted to the academy's decision. Cosby's wife, Camille, described his conviction as ""mob justice, not real justice"". ""This tragedy must be undone not just for Bill Cosby, but for the country,"" she said. Oscars board expels Harvey Weinstein Bill Cosby: The fall of 'America's Dad' The prestigious organisation made the announcement on Thursday - two days after its board members voted on the issue. In a statement, it said its board ""has voted to expel actor Bill Cosby and director Roman Polanski from its membership in accordance with the organisation's Standards of Conduct"". ""The Board continues to encourage ethical standards that require members to uphold the Academy's values of respect for human dignity,"" it added. Only four people are known to have been expelled in its 91-year history. The first was actor Carmine Caridi, who had his membership revoked in 2004 afterhe allegedly sent confidential film preview videos,externalto a friend which ended up online. On social media, many people have been asking what took the academy so long to take action against Polanski, who has been honoured in the decades since he admitted to statutory rape. 1981: Best Director for Tess 2003: Best Picture for The Pianist 2003: Best Director for The Pianist (which he won) The unlawful sex case against Polanski, now aged 84, has dragged on for more than 40 years. Polanski admitted unlawful sex with Samantha Geimer, who was a minor in 1977, and served 42 days in prison, but later fled the US over concern that a plea bargain deal would be scrapped. This video can not be played Samantha Geimar: Consequences of rape were awful He has French and Polish citizenship, and has evaded various extradition attempts by US authorities. France - where he lives - does not extradite its own citizens. A Polish court also rejected a US request when he was filming in Krakow in 2015. The Swiss authorities also turned down a US warrant in 2010, after placing Polanski under house arrest for nine months. Last year,he was picked to head the jury at the CÃ©sars, the French equivalent of the Oscars. He stepped down after the move sparked outrage. Last year, Ms Geimer told a US court she had forgiven Polanski and wanted to move on. But the court refused her plea. By James Cook, BBC News, Los Angeles Why now? That's the question, isn't it? For Bill Cosby, the answer appears obvious. A criminal conviction seems to be the standard which was applied in this case: expulsion from the academy came just one week after a guilty verdict. Roman Polanski's expulsion, by very stark contrast, comes more than 2,000 weeks after he pleaded guilty to having sex with a minor. Not only that but Harvey Weinstein was expelled without a criminal conviction although he faces (and denies) allegations of rape. So why did it take Hollywood more than 40 years to decide that the statutory rape of a 13-year-old was beneath its precious ""values of respect for human dignity""? The academy recently implemented revised standards of conduct for its 8,400 members, including a provision to suspend or expel those who ""compromise the integrity"" of the organisation. The real answer though does not lie in bureaucracy but in shame. The industry has been shamed into action by the disinfecting sunlight of the #MeToo and Time's Up movements. The problem for the academy is that this harsh glare is shining on many other members and with each expulsion the pressure grows to act in those cases too. In April, Cosby, 80, was found guilty of three counts of sexual assault, each of which carries a potential 10 years in prison. He was on trial for drugging and assaulting ex-basketball player Andrea Constand in 2004. It was the second time the actor had stood trial for the allegations, after an earlier jury failed to reach a verdict in 2017. Cosby starred in sitcom The Cosby Show, which was a global hit and ran from 1984-92. Cosby was widely known as ""America's Dad"" for his fatherly role in the comedy.

Bercow behaviour 'explosive and intemperate',"This video can not be played Ex-Black Rod: John Bercow called me an anti-Semite Commons Speaker John Bercow creates a climate of ""fear and intimidation"", an ex-senior Parliament official has said. David Leakey, who was responsible for keeping order in the House of Lords, told BBC Newsnight he had seen ""bullying and unreasonable"" behaviour. He is the second official to accuse the Speaker of bullying. Earlier in the week Mr Bercow's ex-private secretary accused him of ""angry outbursts"". Mr Bercow's official spokesman has rejected all of the claims. Mr Leakey, who served as Black Rod until 2017, said he had a disagreement with Mr Bercow over seating arrangements for a ""high profile visit"" at Westminster. He said ""the red mist descended"" on Mr Bercow who ""banged the table, yelled and was highly insulting to me personally"". Mr Leakey said the speaker called him an ""anti-Semite"" for which Mr Bercow later apologised. The former Black Rod said: ""For me it's water off a duck's back but if that happened to someone else who was not used to that sort of treatment, that is by any definition bullying, it is intimidating, unreasonable, disproportionate."" Mr Leakey said Mr Bercow's behaviour could be seen by the public in the chamber where the speaker ""intimidates, mimics and mocks"" MPs. He said MPs were ""fearful"" of complaining because the speaker could be ""vindictive"" and not call on them to speak in the future. Mr Leakey said he did not believe Mr Bercow ""matches up to the standard"" he would expect from a public servant. He also said removing Mr Bercow would need the support of the Labour party but they ""obtain a considerable political benefit"" from the speaker's treatment of Conservative front-benchers. A spokesman for Mr Bercow's office said: ""John Bercow and David Leakey are two very different people with very different backgrounds, perspectives and ideas. ""They had fundamental disagreements in 2011 and 2012, but interacted adequately after that."" Bercow claims 'concerning', says No 10 Harassment at the House of Commons MPs' discipline 'cannot be left to MPs' The Speaker's Chaplain Rev Rose Hudson-Wilkin told BBC's Daily Politics that Mr Bercow was ""very kind, caring and compassionate."" ""I know that if he felt that he had done something to someone, that he would be mortified,"" she said. ""It feels like a frenzy at the moment and that concerns me. Not only in relation to Mr Bercow, but in terms of other MPs, there are times when a frenzy is whipped up around individuals and that is quite concerning in terms of their well-being."" This video can not be played John Bercow is asked in the Commons about bullying allegations against him On Wednesday, the prime minister's spokesman said that allegations of bullying against Mr Bercow claims were ""concerning"" and should be properly investigated. Mr Bercow's former private secretaryAngus Sinclair has claimed that the Speaker shouted and swore at him, and attempted to physically intimidate him. Mr Sinclair toldNewsnightthat he faced angry outbursts from Mr Bercow whilst working for him in 2009-10. A spokesman for Mr Bercow said there was ""no substance"" to the allegations. Mr Bercow said in the Commons on Wednesday:  ""I have a superb team of dedicated, effective and long-serving staff, five of whom have served me for a collective total of over 40 years. ""I am also happy to confirm that the great majority of people who have left my service have done so on perfectly amicable terms."" An inquiry, under Dame Laura Cox QC, is under way into claims of bullying by MPs. Leader of the House and Tory MP Andrea Leadsom said on Wednesday it was up to Dame Laura to decide if her independent inquiry needed to be expanded to allow for investigations into individuals to take place.

Dust storms kill more than 100 in India,"This video can not be played The storms destroyed homes and uprooted trees At least 109 people have been killed and scores more injured in fierce dust storms that hit the northern Indian states of Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan. The storms on Wednesday disrupted electricity, uprooted trees, destroyed houses and killed livestock. Many of the dead were sleeping when their houses collapsed after being struck by intense bursts of lightning. Dust storms are common in this part of India during summer but loss of life on this scale is unusual. At least 73 people died in Uttar Pradesh - more than half of them of them in Agra district, which is home to the Taj Mahal monument. Officials say the death toll could increase further. Taj Mahal minarets damaged in storm The victims of India's poisonous dust The tragic lives of India's mistreated captive elephants Falling trees and walls killed many people in the state. Local journalist Laxmikant Pachouri told the BBC that 21 people had died in the village of Kheragarh, about 50km (30 miles) south-west of Agra. More than 20 people were left dead in Kheragarh village Some of the houses there were made of mud, others from bricks and mortar. ""People are in shock and can't believe that such destruction happened in their village. I met a family which lost four children last night - it was so disturbing. The family can't believe it. They told me that their children were playing in the house when a wall collapsed on them,"" Pachouri said. ""Their parents are so distraught and cannot stop crying."" Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he was saddened by the loss of life. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Officials say Alwar is worst affected. Schools in the district are closed. Alwar hotel owner Shivam Lohia said he abandoned his car after it was almost blown off the road. ""I haven't seen such a devastating storm in at least 25 years. Everyone was scared and running for cover as trees and homes were getting blown away. It was a nightmare,"" he told the AFP news agency. The Uttar Pradesh government has also announced that families of the dead will receive 400,000 rupees ($6,000; Â£4,400) as compensation. The southern state of Andhra Pradesh, meanwhile, was hit by more than 41,000 lightning strikes on Wednesday, reported news agency AFP - saying there had also been deaths in that state. Officials said they had been taken aback by the ferocity of the storms. ""I've been in office for 20 years and this is the worst I've seen,"" Hemant Gera, secretary for disaster management and relief in Rajasthan, told the BBC. This man in Agra was one of many carried from the debris of homes ""We had a high intensity dust storm on 11 April - 19 people died then - but this time it struck during the night so many people sleeping and couldn't get out of their houses when mud walls collapsed."" Mr Gera said teams were trying to restore electricity to homes after 200 to 300 electricity poles were felled in the storm. The dust storm also hit the capital Delhi, more than 100km (62 miles) away, late on Wednesday evening. The city was also belted by heavy rain.

"Breast screen helpline inundated by callsIt follows revelations that 450,000 women have not been invited for breast scans since 2009.22m22 minutes agoHealth","Breast cancer screening is offered once every three years to women aged 50 to 70 More than 8,000 calls have been made to a helpline since it was revealed that450,000 women were not invited to routine breast cancer screeningdue to a computer error. Public Health England says it was not aware of a national problem with the screening programme until January. But the BBC understands that two NHS trusts in England raised concerns about IT issues as early as March 2017. They were told the problems were a local - not national - matter. It is understood the IT problem related to an algorithm used to decide the order in which to send letters to women of different ages. The national screening error, which dates back to 2009, meant women aged 68 to 71 were not sent letters inviting them to their final screening appointment. Breast cancer screening is currently offered once every three years to women aged 50 to 70 in the UK. How many lives does breast screening save? Signs of breast cancer explained, using lemons Breast size dissatisfaction 'affects self-examination' Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said that up to 270 lives may have been cut short because of the mistake. The 309,000 women affected - those who are still alive - would be contacted by letter by the end of May with the offer of catch-up mammograms, he said. Breast cancer survivors are demanding answers and experts are asking why the error was not spotted sooner, as cancer charities are being inundated with calls. This video can not be played Helen Jarvis experienced problems with the helpline Breast Cancer Care said its helpline had received four times its usual number of calls in one day. Clinical director Dr Emma Pennery said women contacting them were feeling ""angry and confused"". ""Many are anxiously playing a waiting game until the letters arrive, not knowing if they've been affected. ""Others are extremely worried about when their letters will arrive and how long it will take to get screened."" Cancer experts have cautioned that there are pros and cons to screening - not all cancers are picked up by screening and sometimes those picked up do not need to be treated. If you think you may be affected: call the breast screening helpline number 0800 169 2692 go theNHS Choices website,externalfor more information you should receive a letter by the end of May Helen Baczkowska's mother Ann died of breast cancer in 2014, aged 74, after being diagnosed in 2012. She was registered with a GP but had not had a mammogram for several years. Helen fears she may have been one of those overlooked by the screening programme: ""I remember having conversations with her where she said, 'you know what, I haven't been called for a screening for some time', and there was just a question in her mind as to why she hadn't been called, and then of course she discovered a lump herself. ""We think she may have tried to inquire, but didn't really know who to speak to as it didn't come through the GP, it's a separate system. ""You never know with someone's cancer whether it could have been very aggressive anyway. There are so many variables. ""It's hard to lose somebody and to have tried to have moved on through your grief and then have it all brought back."" Lee Towsey's mother died of breast cancer in 2012, aged 70, having found a lump. She did not have a mammogram around the time that she should have done. Mr Towsey feels that the whole screening process was badly organised. He said: ""I don't know where to take it from here, but I need to talk to my family. ""I mean, it's outrageous, it's disgusting, and I think that someone needs to resign, to be honest. ""It's like it doesn't matter that 270 women died, it just doesn't matter. Who cares?"" Sara Hiom, director of early diagnosis at Cancer Research UK, said the women affected would have missed ""the final of what could have been seven rounds of screening"". ""If we assume that they attended every other screening round that they would have been invited to from the age of around 50, then they have at least had several opportunities to have any breast cancer diagnosed earlier."" A recent report on the NHS found that the number of women who accepted invitations to breast screenings had fallen to 71%, a 10-year low. The Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) has questioned why health chiefs did not raise any alarms. Public Health England spotted the issue in January while analysing data from the Age X trial - which was testing the idea of screening women up to the age of 73. Breast screening: Is the NHS programme working? Breast screening: What went wrong? Breast screening: For and against Why isn't breast cancer screening totally reliable? The BBC understands an error led to women in the control group wrongly being offered screenings up until their 70th birthday, rather than their 71st. Dr Jenny Harries, deputy medical director of Public Health England, toldBBC Radio 4's Today programme:""There are a number of organisations involved in this and I think we are all - Public Health England, the NHS, NHS Digital, the Department of Health - devastated by this. ""We have a screening programme that is world-class. ""We wouldn't want any lives to be shortened. We have gone back and fixed all these glitches and audited that, so women can be assured going forward that that is sorted.""

Afghan interpreters 'should stay in UK'The defence secretary says he is confident those who served with British troops will be able to remain.2h2 hours agoUK,"Afghan interpreters worked with the Army on the frontline in Helmand Province Afghan interpreters who served with British troops fighting against the Taliban should be able to stay in the UK, the defence secretary has said. More than 150 Afghans given five-year residency permits say they face being sent back to Afghanistan when they expire, unless they pay Â£2,389 to apply for indefinite leave to remain. Gavin Williamson said the Home Office should waive the fees. The UK owed them gratitude, he said, and they had ""every right"" to remain. Afghan interpreter 'will die if deported' BBC reporter killed in Afghanistan attack In a letter to the Home Office and Mr Williamson - which has been seen by the BBC - the interpreters said they had been left in ""limbo"" and urged the government to grant them and their families the right to live in the UK. They accused the government of preventing some of their families from coming to Britain, noting that couples who had had children since arriving were facing problems. The group, who served on the front line in Helmand Province, also called for access to veterans' benefits, war pensions for the wounded and for interpreters left back in Afghanistan to be brought over on the same terms as those now in the UK. Mr Williamson told BBC defence correspondent Jonathan Beale: ""We've made it absolutely clear they should be staying in this country. ""We've been in touch with the Home Office making that position clear, and I'm confident that the Home Office will be supporting us to ensure that that happens as quickly as possible."" When asked if the visa fees - which many interpreters say they cannot pay - will be waived, Mr Williamson said: ""That is our suggestion and we are very confident the Home Office will see the sense in what we are proposing."" The defence secretary said he would be ""amazed"" if interpreters who helped the Army were deported The group behind the letter served with the Army in 2012 and were brought to the UK in 2014 on initial five-year residency permits. Numerous problems have followed, however, with some complaining their uncertain status has prevented them from finding employment. Others whose children have been born in the UK are struggling to obtain documentation for them - and may have to pay Â£1,200 to apply for an Afghan passport and then a British visa. Many interpreters fear their ties to the British forces will endanger them if they return to Afghanistan, withone telling the BBC he believed he would be killed by the Taliban. The defence secretary added that he had ""no doubt"" the matter would be resolved swiftly. The BBC has contacted the Home Office for comment.

England council voting enters final hours,"There is less than an hour to go for people to vote in council and mayoral elections across England. Polling stations, which opened at 07:00 BST, will close at 22:00 BST. Elections are being held in 150 local authorities, spanning metropolitan and district councils, unitary authorities and London boroughs. Watford, Hackney, Newham, Lewisham and Tower Hamlets will elect mayors while the first-ever mayor for the Sheffield City Region will also be chosen.

Rolling updates: Voters go to polls How to cast your vote on polling day West Tyrone by-election voting under way There are no local elections in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. However, a parliamentary by-election for the Westminster seat of West Tyrone is taking place. The council polls, in which 4,371 seats are being contested, are the first England-wide test of electoral opinion since last year's general election.

The prime minister's spokesman said all eligible voters in those areas had been told they needed to bring a form of ID. He said: ""The vast majority of people are casting their vote without a problem.

Should Trump worry about Stormy?,"This video can not be played Stormy Daniels: 'I was threatened' A porn star has given details in a television interview of an alleged affair with the US president. What impact might this have on Donald Trump? Like kids waiting for Santa to come down the chimney, how can the expectation and anticipation ever live up to the reality? And so it was with Stormy. There were ""watch parties"" as friends gathered a la Superbowl or Oscars, with bowls of nachos and popcorn lined up on coffee tables. Bars were offering Dark and Stormy cocktails in honour of the eponymous star of the show. Like so much else in this presidency it was reality TV on steroids. I confess I had been with friends and we discussed what would be the worst thing she could say. What if she brought on to set three 12-year-old blond-haired boys with comb-overs and red ties that went below their waist? In the event there was nothing of the sort. Stormy Daniels seemed poised throughout the interview. She detailed a night in Lake Tahoe where she says she had sex with the president, without too much salacious detail. Yes, a bit of light-hearted slap and tickle. But the way she described it, it was more saucy end-of-the-pier show than it was Fifty Shades of Grey. Some people were glued to it She is whip smart (to coin a phrase).  And with a quick wit. I thought one of the killer lines was when she recalled that Donald Trump is alleged to have said: ""You are smart, just like my daughter."" (I can't imagine Ivanka taking kindly to that). Porn star 'threatened over Trump affair' Stormy was very quick to point out their encounter was consensual, and that she was making no #MeToo-style complaint. On social media most of the discussion seemed to be about the size of her pupils during the interview. They were huge, and normally when you are under blinding camera lights they are pinpoints. The interview also suffered because quite a lot of things had been offered as teasers before it aired. I knew she was going to allege that she had been threatened. Her lawyer had said as much in an earlier interview. And we knew all about the $130,000 (Â£91,000) non-disclosure agreement. Also, it wasn't an affair - it was one night only. So when I finished watching I thought: ""Well, there really isn't that much there."" And the biggest tease of all - the picture posted on social media by Stormy's lawyer of a CD or DVD, with the caption ""If a picture is worth a thousand words, how much is this worthâ¦?"" There was no explanation. It was gratingly and somewhat too-clever-by-half left unexplained. Is it bluff, or is it real? Is it the secret weapon, only to be detonated in extremis? Whatever it is, the viewer was left none the wiser. Trump denies they had a relationship So a big yawn, and nothing like as exciting as the Kansas vs Duke basketball game that went into extra time, thus delaying the airing of the 60 Minutes interview. But hang on. This isn't a woman making allegations about some two-bit soap star. This is about the man who is now president of the United States. And yes, there is a lot of he said, she said - but isn't a ""she said"" that some goon threatened her as she was taking her infant child out of a car seat that unless she dropped the Trump allegations, kind of alarming? And her claims of repeated attempts to silence her? And then there is the one undisputed fact in all this. The president and the porn star: Why this matters Ex-model apologises for 'Trump affair' Donald Trump's lawyer paid her $130,000. You don't do that because you're worried that Stormy might reveal she had tea with Mr Trump at a golf tournament in Lake Tahoe or that she met him at a vodka launch in California. Does that payment pass the smell test? Are we to believe that this philanthropic, beneficent great big softie of an attorney just dishes out suitcases of $100 bills to anyone passing by? ""Here you are young lady, go and buy yourself a lovely new mink coat, courtesy of meâ¦"" You don't have to believe every word that Stormy Daniels uttered (although most people I've spoken to - and by no means all anti-Trump - think she came across as credible), and she admits that she lied in putting her name to the denial of an affair. There are uncomfortable questions for her conduct and her motives. But surely the burden is on the president to explain why she was paid that money, and with such stringent conditions attached. Again, as I say, if it was just a cup of tea and a little chat about appearing on Celebrity Apprentice, why would you want her silenced? Which brings us to consequences. There is a legal argument over whether this payment breaks campaign finance laws. I am no scholar in this matter, but isn't this a payment to benefit the Trump campaign? Surely it strains credulity that the payment, made 11 days before polling, was some kind of weird coincidence. Her silence certainly did help his campaign. The rockiest moment of Mr Trump's bid for the White House had come earlier with the publication of the Access Hollywood tape when he was heard making lewd comments about what he could do to women. Fresh disclosures from a former porn star would have certainly whipped up a Stormy storm. Complaints have been made to the Federal Election Commission and to the Justice Department. That is awkward, but wheels there move slowly - and what is the worst that is going to happen? A fine? A slap on the wrists? Perhaps more dangerous is that this might prick the interest of the special counsel, Robert Mueller, looking into allegations of Russian collusion and the Trump campaign. And before you rightly say to me: ""Huh? What's Stormy got to do with Russian cyber-hacking?"" it's worth pointing out what happened with the special prosecutor, Kenneth Starr, who was appointed to investigate Bill Clinton. It started as an inquiry into an Arkansas land deal, and ended with the perjury committed by the president over his relationship with Monica Lewinsky. Mr Mueller might be investigating Russia, but if he's going through a dark room with his torch/flashlight and trips over something else, the thing that he accidentally kicked over can easily become the subject of investigation. Another thing. In Washington we move from story to story with lightning speed. Everything is here today gone tomorrow. I honestly struggle to remember which story I covered two days ago, such is the breathless pace. Stormy Daniels has been in the news for weeks now. It may not affect the Trump core of supporters. But the 52% of white, college educated women who voted for him in 2016? The evangelicals? The independents? Old-school Republicans? There are important mid-term elections coming up in November, remember. There's been no response from the president since the interview and all calls to his press office refer us to previous White House statements denying the relationship took place. Stormy Daniels was interviewed by Anderson Cooper for CBS News 60 Minutes So a final question - does Mr Trump care or is he just brushing this off? He boasts about what a great counter puncher he is. And we've seen it again and again. Theresa May criticises him over retweeting anti Muslim videos - and biff - he hits back. Meryl Streep dares to question him - and thwack, she's an overrated actor. His enemies are mercilessly assailed: weak, pathetic, useless, snivelling, lying, low-energy, little. And of Stormy Daniels he has not tweeted a single word.

How the BBC reports polling day,"Online coverage of election night will come from the BBC newsroom in central London The BBC, like other broadcasters, isn't allowed to report details of campaigning while the polls are open. The BBC is required by electoral law to adopt a code of practice, ensuring fairness between candidates and that is particularly important on polling day. The code of practice is contained in more detailed election guidelines which are written and published for each election - and theyinclude guidance on polling day, here.,external On polling day specifically, the BBC doesn't report on any of the election campaigns from 00:30 BST until polls close at 22:00 BST on TV, radio or bbc.co.uk or on social media and other channels. However, online sites do not have to remove archived reports, including, for instance, programmes on iPlayer. Coverage on the day is usually restricted to uncontroversial factual accounts, such as the appearance of politicians at polling stations, or the weather. It tends to focus on giving information which will help voters with the process of going to polling stations. Subjects which have been at issue or part of the campaign - or other controversial matters relating to the election - must not be covered on polling day itself;  it's important that the BBC's output cannot be seen to be directly influencing the ballot while the polls are open. However, that does not mean that other politics, for instance, what happens in Parliament or political events and stories not directly connected to the elections, cannot be covered. And, of course, output broadcasting only to places where there are no elections, such as in Scotland and Wales, are not subject to the restrictions in the same way. No opinion poll on any issue relating to politics or the election can be published until after the polls have closed. Whilst the polls are open, it is a criminal offence to publish anything about the way in which people have voted in that election. From 22:00 BST normal reporting of the council election resumes, with rolling online BBC coverage overnight, and Election 2018 on BBC One with Huw Edwards and Laura Kuenssberg.

EU's Juncker: Let UK staff become BelgiansThe EU Commission chief wants Belgium to grant citizenship to British EU staff.,"British expats in Brussels don't want to lose the rights they currently enjoy The EU Commission President, Jean-Claude Juncker, has urged Belgium to grant citizenship to British EU staff worried about their post-Brexit status. About 1,100 UK citizens work for the EU in Brussels and Luxembourg. Mr Juncker called Belgium a kind host and asked its prime minister, Charles Michel, to ""show the same generosity when it comes to granting Belgian citizenship"" to British EU staff. When the UK leaves the EU next March Britons will lose their EU citizenship. The UK and EU have already pledged to protect citizens' rights after Brexit, but that does not mean granting nationality. Article 49 of the EU staff rules states that ""an official may be required to resign"",externalif he or she loses their EU citizenship and is no longer a national of an EU member state. Many British EU staff are longstanding residents with families. An internal EU Commission document quoted by Politico news last month,externalsaid Article 49 would not mean British staff losing their EU jobs, apart from cases involving ""conflicts of interest or international obligations"". The huge Berlaymont building in central Brussels houses the European Commission Responding to Mr Juncker's plea during a European Parliament debate, Mr Michel said Belgium's citizenship law in the context of Brexit was ""contradictory"", but he did not specify the difficulties. ""The government is examining the judicial possibilities on this question, which affects a number of people who have been living in our country for a long time,"" he said. European Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas said later that Mr Juncker's remarks were meant as a reminder for the Belgian leader. ""We live up to the promise that our colleagues of British nationality should be given maximum guarantees to stay, not only with their employment but also if they want to stay as Belgian citizens. But this is entirely in the hands of the Belgian government, not ours,"" he said. Why some Brits are opting for Belgian citizenship Brexit: All you need to know Britons win legal step in EU rights case Rights of EU citizens in UK and Britons in EU after Brexit EU citizenship is described in Article 20 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and includes the rights to: Travel and live anywhere in the EU Vote and stand as a candidate in European and local elections in another EU country Get diplomatic protection and consular help from any other EU country in another part of the world. Michael Ashbrook of Solidarity, Independence, Democracy (SID), a trade union representing EU staff, told the BBC that ""all the British staff are trying for EU citizenship"". ""They are very worried"", he said, referring to the impact of Brexit on their jobs. ""There has been talk of dismissing British 'contract agents' on Brexit day, rather than letting them complete their fixed-term contracts,"" he said. Resolving the status of British staff, to keep them in their jobs, would take the Commission ""just a few minutes"", he said. Brexit sets a legal precedent for the EU and raises a host of new legal challenges, because no state has left the 28-nation bloc before. In the debate the Belgian leader clashed with UKIP's Nigel Farage, an anti-EU MEP. ""Belgium is not a nation; it's an artificial creation,"" Mr Farage said. The Dutch- and French-speaking parts of Belgium ""dislike each other intensely"", he alleged. Mr Michel replied ironically: ""I'm happy to hear this sound advice from Nigel Farage on the future of Belgium. He has been busy with the future of Britain, with Brexit - and we can see where Britain has got to with that."" To qualify for Belgian citizenship, an applicant must have lived in Belgium for at least five years legally and passed a language test. Luxembourg requires at least five years' residence and competence in Luxembourgish, a language with only about 390,000 native speakers.

Dust storms kill at least 100 in India,"This video can not be played The storms destroyed homes and uprooted trees At least 109 people have been killed and scores more injured in fierce dust storms that hit the northern Indian states of Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan. The storms on Wednesday disrupted electricity, uprooted trees, destroyed houses and killed livestock. Many of the dead were sleeping when their houses collapsed after being struck by intense bursts of lightning. Dust storms are common in this part of India during summer but loss of life on this scale is unusual. At least 73 people died in Uttar Pradesh - more than half of them of them in Agra district, which is home to the Taj Mahal monument. Officials say the death toll could increase further. Taj Mahal minarets damaged in storm The victims of India's poisonous dust The tragic lives of India's mistreated captive elephants Falling trees and walls killed many people in the state. Local journalist Laxmikant Pachouri told the BBC that 21 people had died in the village of Kheragarh, about 50km (30 miles) south-west of Agra. More than 20 people were left dead in Kheragarh village Some of the houses there were made of mud, others from bricks and mortar. ""People are in shock and can't believe that such destruction happened in their village. I met a family which lost four children last night - it was so disturbing. The family can't believe it. They told me that their children were playing in the house when a wall collapsed on them,"" Pachouri said. ""Their parents are so distraught and cannot stop crying."" Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he was saddened by the loss of life. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Officials say Alwar is worst affected. Schools in the district are closed. Alwar hotel owner Shivam Lohia said he abandoned his car after it was almost blown off the road. ""I haven't seen such a devastating storm in at least 25 years. Everyone was scared and running for cover as trees and homes were getting blown away. It was a nightmare,"" he told the AFP news agency. The Uttar Pradesh government has also announced that families of the dead will receive 400,000 rupees ($6,000; Â£4,400) as compensation. The southern state of Andhra Pradesh, meanwhile, was hit by more than 41,000 lightning strikes on Wednesday, reported news agency AFP - saying there had also been deaths in that state. Officials said they had been taken aback by the ferocity of the storms. ""I've been in office for 20 years and this is the worst I've seen,"" Hemant Gera, secretary for disaster management and relief in Rajasthan, told the BBC. This man in Agra was one of many carried from the debris of homes ""We had a high intensity dust storm on 11 April - 19 people died then - but this time it struck during the night so many people sleeping and couldn't get out of their houses when mud walls collapsed."" Mr Gera said teams were trying to restore electricity to homes after 200 to 300 electricity poles were felled in the storm. The dust storm also hit the capital Delhi, more than 100km (62 miles) away, late on Wednesday evening. The city was also belted by heavy rain.

Voters going to the polls across England,"There is less than an hour to go for people to vote in council and mayoral elections across England. Polling stations, which opened at 07:00 BST, will close at 22:00 BST. Elections are being held in 150 local authorities, spanning metropolitan and district councils, unitary authorities and London boroughs. Watford, Hackney, Newham, Lewisham and Tower Hamlets will elect mayors while the first-ever mayor for the Sheffield City Region will also be chosen.

Afghan interpreters 'should stay in UK',"Afghan interpreters worked with the Army on the frontline in Helmand Province Afghan interpreters who served with British troops fighting against the Taliban should be able to stay in the UK, the defence secretary has said. More than 150 Afghans given five-year residency permits say they face being sent back to Afghanistan when they expire, unless they pay Â£2,389 to apply for indefinite leave to remain. Gavin Williamson said the Home Office should waive the fees. The UK owed them gratitude, he said, and they had ""every right"" to remain. Afghan interpreter 'will die if deported' BBC reporter killed in Afghanistan attack In a letter to the Home Office and Mr Williamson - which has been seen by the BBC - the interpreters said they had been left in ""limbo"" and urged the government to grant them and their families the right to live in the UK. They accused the government of preventing some of their families from coming to Britain, noting that couples who had had children since arriving were facing problems. The group, who served on the front line in Helmand Province, also called for access to veterans' benefits, war pensions for the wounded and for interpreters left back in Afghanistan to be brought over on the same terms as those now in the UK. Mr Williamson told BBC defence correspondent Jonathan Beale: ""We've made it absolutely clear they should be staying in this country. ""We've been in touch with the Home Office making that position clear, and I'm confident that the Home Office will be supporting us to ensure that that happens as quickly as possible."" When asked if the visa fees - which many interpreters say they cannot pay - will be waived, Mr Williamson said: ""That is our suggestion and we are very confident the Home Office will see the sense in what we are proposing."" The defence secretary said he would be ""amazed"" if interpreters who helped the Army were deported The group behind the letter served with the Army in 2012 and were brought to the UK in 2014 on initial five-year residency permits. Numerous problems have followed, however, with some complaining their uncertain status has prevented them from finding employment. Others whose children have been born in the UK are struggling to obtain documentation for them - and may have to pay Â£1,200 to apply for an Afghan passport and then a British visa. Many interpreters fear their ties to the British forces will endanger them if they return to Afghanistan, withone telling the BBC he believed he would be killed by the Taliban. The defence secretary added that he had ""no doubt"" the matter would be resolved swiftly. The BBC has contacted the Home Office for comment.

Acid victim 'told accused to kill herself',"Berlinah Wallace (right) said she and Mark van Dongen argued after he told her he had slept with another woman A man who had sulphuric acid thrown over him said his former partner should kill herself by drinking acid while he watched, a court has heard. Berlinah Wallace, 48, denies murder and applying a corrosive fluid to Mark van Dongen, 29, in Bristol in 2015. He ended his life in a Belgian euthanasia clinic 15 months later. Ms Wallace told Bristol Crown Court Mr van Dongen fetched a bottle of acid from the kitchen during an argument the day before he was allegedly attacked. Under questioning by Richard Smith QC, for the defence, Ms Wallace said she and Mr van Dongen had argued after he told her he had slept with another woman. ""I said 'why don't you just kill me', because I can't have any peace with him,"" Ms Wallace told the court. ""He said I should kill myself. He went into the kitchen and came back with the acid and put it on the table. ""He said 'there you go, you kill yourself - I'll watch'."" Berlinah Wallace denies murder and applying a corrosive fluid to Mr van Dongen Ms Wallace told the court Mr van Dongen had got her a glass of water for her to take her medication. She said she tried to leave the flat after the pair ""bickered"" and he tried to stop her physically from leaving. ""I asked him to stop, he didn't. I wanted something to hit him with. ""I reached for something, got a cup, turned around and threw the water at him."" Mr Smith asked: ""Did you know what was in the glass?"" ""No I didn't. I thought it was water. I just wanted him to stop because he was hurting me,"" Ms Wallace replied. She told the jury Mr van Dongen said ""ooh, you threw acid at me"", and as she turned around while trying to run away she saw ""smoke or something"" coming from him. ""He was saying 'it hurts, it hurts', she said. She told the court Mr van Dongen had a shower and then left the flat. Previously she told the court she had bought a bottle of sulphuric acid in order to clear drains and to ""distress"" fabric. Mr van Dongen was left paralysed from the neck down and lost his left leg, ear and eye following the alleged attack in the early hours of 23 September 2015. The trial continues.

"Teens 'plotted Columbine-style attack'Prosecutors allege they ""worshipped"" students behind the Columbine High school shootings in the US.15m16 minutes agoYork & North Yorkshire","The prosecution argues the boys planned to recreate an American high school shooting Two boys plotted to kill fellow pupils and teachers after becoming obsessed with a school shooting in the US, a court heard. Prosecutors allege the pair ""hero-worshipped"" two students who killed 12 pupils and a teacher at Columbine High School in Colorado in 1999. The boys, both 15, deny conspiracy to murder and other offences. They allegedly planned the attack at a school in Northallerton, North Yorkshire, Leeds Crown Court heard. Get live updates on this story and others across Yorkshire The Columbine massacre was carried out by Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, who then committed suicide. Prosecutor Paul Greaney QC said: ""Eighteen years after the Columbine massacre and nearly 4,500 miles away, two young teenagers in North Yorkshire became fascinated with Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold. ""Those two teenagers researched and discussed those killers and their interest in them turned to hero worship."" He said this was the background that led the then 14-year-olds to plot their own attack at the school, which cannot be named. ""In that attack, they intended to shoot and kill other pupils and teachers against whom they held a grievance,"" Mr Greaney added. ""They also, like their heroes, intended to deploy explosives and researched bombing-making techniques to that end."" Mr Greaney said the ""hideout"" of one of the boys, described as the apparent leader, was found in an abandoned shack and contained materials, including petrol and a bag of screws, that were capable of being used in bomb-making. He said this showed the boys' plan was not a fantasy. He told the jury that both defendants had downloaded a bomb-making manual from the internet within minutes of each other and one of the boys had kept a diary with ""significant and disturbing content"". ""Even the diary that has been recovered demonstrates that murderous intentions were real,"" Mr Greaney said. Mr Greaney also revealed a conversation between the two boys on an instant messaging platform in May 2017: ""Boy 1: 'I can't be bothered anymore.' ""Boy 2 (the alleged leader): 'Why not take some others out as well?' ""Boy 1: 'What do you mean?' ""Boy 2: 'If you're gonna kill yourself, shoot up the school.""' He said the boys - who cannot be identified because of their ages - were stopped before they could put the plan into action. Both defendants deny a joint charge of conspiracy to murder between 31 December 2016 and 29 October last year. They also deny a charge of intentionally encouraging or assisting an offence and a charge of encouraging or assisting an offence believing it would be committed. One of the boys is also charged with one offence of the unlawful wounding of a teenage girl and another of aggravated burglary, which he denies. The trial continues.

Dust storms kill nearly 100 in India,"This video can not be played The storms destroyed homes and uprooted trees At least 109 people have been killed and scores more injured in fierce dust storms that hit the northern Indian states of Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan. The storms on Wednesday disrupted electricity, uprooted trees, destroyed houses and killed livestock. Many of the dead were sleeping when their houses collapsed after being struck by intense bursts of lightning. Dust storms are common in this part of India during summer but loss of life on this scale is unusual. At least 73 people died in Uttar Pradesh - more than half of them of them in Agra district, which is home to the Taj Mahal monument. Officials say the death toll could increase further. Taj Mahal minarets damaged in storm The victims of India's poisonous dust The tragic lives of India's mistreated captive elephants Falling trees and walls killed many people in the state. Local journalist Laxmikant Pachouri told the BBC that 21 people had died in the village of Kheragarh, about 50km (30 miles) south-west of Agra. More than 20 people were left dead in Kheragarh village Some of the houses there were made of mud, others from bricks and mortar. ""People are in shock and can't believe that such destruction happened in their village. I met a family which lost four children last night - it was so disturbing. The family can't believe it. They told me that their children were playing in the house when a wall collapsed on them,"" Pachouri said. ""Their parents are so distraught and cannot stop crying."" Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he was saddened by the loss of life. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Officials say Alwar is worst affected. Schools in the district are closed. Alwar hotel owner Shivam Lohia said he abandoned his car after it was almost blown off the road. ""I haven't seen such a devastating storm in at least 25 years. Everyone was scared and running for cover as trees and homes were getting blown away. It was a nightmare,"" he told the AFP news agency. The Uttar Pradesh government has also announced that families of the dead will receive 400,000 rupees ($6,000; Â£4,400) as compensation. The southern state of Andhra Pradesh, meanwhile, was hit by more than 41,000 lightning strikes on Wednesday, reported news agency AFP - saying there had also been deaths in that state. Officials said they had been taken aback by the ferocity of the storms. ""I've been in office for 20 years and this is the worst I've seen,"" Hemant Gera, secretary for disaster management and relief in Rajasthan, told the BBC. This man in Agra was one of many carried from the debris of homes ""We had a high intensity dust storm on 11 April - 19 people died then - but this time it struck during the night so many people sleeping and couldn't get out of their houses when mud walls collapsed."" Mr Gera said teams were trying to restore electricity to homes after 200 to 300 electricity poles were felled in the storm. The dust storm also hit the capital Delhi, more than 100km (62 miles) away, late on Wednesday evening. The city was also belted by heavy rain.

Free speech pledge for universitiesThe universities minister promises clearer rules to protect free speech and open debate on campuses.2h2 hours agoFamily & Education,"The right to protest and free speech needs clearer guidelines, the universities minister says Free speech in universities has to be protected from ""chilling"" intolerance and ""over-zealous"" regulations, says the Universities Minister, Sam Gyimah. The minister has met university and student leaders on Thursday to create a more straightforward set of guidelines for ensuring open debate on campus. Mr Gyimah warned ""unfashionable or unpopular"" views should not be stifled. Sir Michael Barber, who chairs the Office for Students, said ""challenging"" ideas had a right to be heard. The meeting of higher education groups and government - described as a ""free speech summit"" - is a response to concerns that universities have become hostile places for freedom of expression. There have been warnings about speakers being blocked by so-called ""no platforming"", where it's claimed their views are so offensive that students try to stop them speaking. But when Parliament's Joint Committee on Human Rights investigated, it found that a bigger problem wasred tape and confusion over what was permissible. ""University bureaucracy"" and fear of controversy was inhibiting free speech, said Harriet Harman, who chairs the committee. Sam Gyimah said free speech needed to be protected from ""wreckers"" and ""bureaucrats"" Mr Gyimah is sending a strong message that a culture of censorship is not acceptable - but also that universities need to have a clearer set of rules over what are the boundaries of debate and protest. He describes the current regulations as ""murky"" and lacking in consistency - and for the first time wants a more coherent set of guidelines that can be used across institutions. It's being claimed as the biggest intervention by ministers in campus free speech for more than 30 years. ""A society in which people feel they have a legitimate right to stop someone expressing their views on campus simply because they are unfashionable or unpopular is rather chilling,"" says Mr Gyimah. ""There is a risk that overzealous interpretation of a dizzying variety of rules is acting as a brake on legal free speech on campus. ""That is why I am bringing together leaders from across the higher education sector to clarify the rules and regulations around speakers and events to prevent bureaucrats or wreckers on campus from exploiting gaps for their own ends."" The new higher education watchdog, the Office for Students, has a responsibility for protecting free speech. Jacob Rees-Mogg faced protests at the University of the West of England Sir Michael Barber, who chairs the new regulator, said: ""Our universities are places where free speech should always be promoted and fostered. ""That includes the ability for everyone to share views which may be challenging or unpopular, even if that makes some people feel uncomfortable."" But Alistair Jarvis, chief executive of Universities UK, pointed to the finding of the parliamentary committee that ""there is no systematic problem with free speech in universities"". ""Universities are committed to promoting and protecting free speech within the law. Tens of thousands of speaking events are put on every year across the country, the majority pass without incident,"" he said. The report from MPs and peers on the Joint Committee on Human Rights found that flashpoints tended to be around a number of ""divisive issues"" - such as Israel and the Palestinian territories, ""transgender issues"", right- and left-wing clashes and ""pro-life or anti-abortion views"". But the committee found little evidence that censorship or confrontations were ""pervasive"" - but instead found that a relatively small number of incidents were being widely shared. Among the most high-profile incidents was a protest against Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg, when he was speaking at the University of the West of England. When Mr Rees-Mogg gave evidence to the committee, he saidheckling could help politicians. ""It can actually be very good for the speaker rather than damaging,"" he told the committee. Harriet Harman, who chaired the committee, said: ""The minister is right to recognise the confusing array of guidance on free speech."" She called for an end to the ""confusion of the duties arising from Prevent, charity law, and the Education Act"". ""Education and learning depend on dialogue and debate,"" she said, and free speech ""includes the right to say anything that's lawful, even when others may find it disturbing, upsetting or offensive"".

Why the Stormy saga matters,"President Donald Trump denies the allegations made by Stormy Daniels Adult film star Stormy Daniels is suing President Donald Trump over a so-called ""hush agreement"". Ms Daniels (her real name is Stephanie Clifford) alleges she and Mr Trump had sex in 2006, and that he has been trying to keep it quiet ever since. A lawyer for Ms Daniels has made claims of a cover-up, and others have raised questions about potentially illegal campaign payments. The president rejects all the allegations, and lawyers are suing Ms Daniels back for breaking this deal. Mr Trump denies that any money from his 2016 presidential campaign was used to buy Ms Daniels' silence,and says that the affair never happened. Using campaign funds could have been a violation of federal law. But while Mr Trump's supporters have largely ignored the story, along withallegations of sexual assaultandthe infamous Access Hollywood tape, the Stormy Daniels case could see the president testify in court - with 2018 mid-term elections just around the corner. She was born in Louisiana in 1979. She moved into the adult film industry first as a performer, before in 2004 branching out into directing and also writing. Her stage name comes from MÃ¶tley CrÃ¼e's bassist Nikki Sixx's daughter Storm, and the US whisky Jack Daniels - which southerner Ms Clifford chose after reading an ad calling the drink ""a Southern favourite"". You may also recognise her cameo appearances in films The 40-Year-Old Virgin and Knocked Up, and the music video for Maroon Five's song Wake Up Call. She also thought of running for a US Senate seat in Louisiana in 2010 but called off her run after she said her candidacy was not being taken seriously. Stormy Daniels, real name Stephanie Clifford, claims she met Donald Trump in 2006 It all goes back to July 2006 - when the White House was merely a twinkle in Donald Trump's eye. Ms Daniels says she met him that month at a charity golf tournament in Lake Tahoe, a resort area between California and Nevada. In a2011 interview with In Touch Weekly,external, published in full in January, she says Mr Trump invited her to dinner and that she went to meet him in his hotel room. ""He was all sprawled out on the couch, watching television or something,"" she said in the interview. ""He was wearing pyjama pants."" Donald Trump, Melania Trump and Barron Trump in January 2007 Ms Daniels alleges the pair had sex in the hotel room, something Mr Trump's lawyer said his client ""vehemently denies"". If Ms Daniels' account is true, this would all have happened just four months after the birth of Mr Trump's youngest child, Barron. This video can not be played Stormy Daniels: 'I was threatened' In a 60 Minutes interview that aired in late March, Ms Daniels claimed she was threatened to stay quiet about the affair. She alleged a man approached her in a Las Vegas car park in 2011, shortly after she agreed to the In Touch Weekly interview, and told her to ""leave Trump alone"". Ms Daniels said the last time they spoke was in 2010, around the time she called off her US Senate bid. Porn star 'threatened over Trump affair' Rumours of the affair started to appear before the November 2016 presidential election. In January,the Wall Street Journal published an article,externalclaiming President Trump's lawyer, Michael Cohen, made a $130,000 (Â£94,000) payment to Ms Daniels in October 2016, one month before the election. The Journal said the money was part of a non-disclosure agreement with Ms Clifford, which said she couldn't discuss the affair publicly. ""These are old, recycled reports, which were published and strongly denied prior to the election,"" a White House official said. Michael Cohen reportedly set up a corporation that made a $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels in October 2016 Mr Cohen denied the payment. In a statement to the Journal, he called the allegations ""outlandish"", and said they'd been ""consistently denied by all parties"" for years. But in February he announced he had in fact paid Ms Daniels the money. In a statement to the New York Times,external, Mr Cohen said neither the Trump campaign nor the Trump organisation knew anything about the payment, which he had made from his own pocket. ""The payment to Ms Daniels was lawful, and was not a campaign contribution or a campaign expenditure by anyone."" On 3 May,President Trump admitted that Mr Cohen had paid off Ms Danielsand was reimbursed. Earlier, his legal aide Rudy Giuliani had said in a TV interview that the money was Mr Trump's personal cash. Meanwhile, Michael Avenatti, Ms Daniels' lawyer, has claimed that the non-disclosure deal Ms Daniels signed was delivered to Mr Cohen at his Trump Tower office. ""This idea that there's a separation now between Mr Cohen, individually, and the Trump Organization or Mr Cohen, individually, and Donald Trump, it's nonsense,"" he told 60 Minutes. Who said what about Stormy Daniels saga Porn star 'free to discuss' Trump story The porn star scandal Trump can't shake The 60 Minutes interview was highly anticipated, withthe New York Times writing about viewing parties across the US,externaland ""Dark and Stormy"" cocktails on offer in bars. Shortly after it aired, lawyers for Mr Cohen filed a cease-and-desist against Ms Daniels and her lawyer, saying the allegations of a threat defamed Mr Cohen. ""Mr Cohen had absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with any such person or incident, and does not even believe that any such person exists, or that such incident ever occurred,"" the letter reads. Before the 60 Minutes episode,President Trump's lawyers sued Ms Daniels for $20mand to keep the case out of the public eye. The lawyers claim she broke their non-disclosure deal, or ""hush agreement"". This followsMs Daniels saying she was suing Mr Trump, claiming he didn't even sign the ""hush agreement"". Her lawyer, Michael Avenatti, tweeted about the lawsuit with a link to the documents filed in a California court. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

There were also reports thatPresident Trump had won a restraining order against Ms Danielsin February. In April,the FBI raided the New York offices of Mr Cohenfollowing a referral from Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating suspected Russian meddling in the 2016 election. US media reported that documents relating to the payment to Ms Daniels were seized in the raid. But the payment was only one of several topics being investigated, according to the New York Times. Mr Cohen's $130,000 payment to Ms Daniels just before the 2016 election could count as an illegal contribution to President Trump's campaign. Trevor Potter, president of the Campaign Legal Center, said if Mr Cohen did this on Mr Trump's behalf, ""that is a co-ordinated, illegal, in-kind contribution by Cohen for the purpose of influencing the election"". Democrats Ted Lieu and Kathleen Rice, representatives for California and New York respectively, have asked the FBI to investigate Mr Cohen's payment to Ms Daniels. Allow Twitter content?

More importantly, the fact there was a payment made at all by Mr Cohen has not been fully explained. Asked whether the affair is important, Ms Daniels' lawyers said: ""This is about the cover-up. ""This is about the extent that Mr Cohen and the president have gone to intimidate this woman, to silence her, to threaten her, and to put her under their thumb,"" said Mr Avenatti. One of the few Republicans to comment, South Carolina congressman Mark Sanford, told the Washington Post the claims were ""deeply troubling"". ""If it was a Democratic president and hush money had been paid in the campaign, would there be a series of hearings going on?"" Mr Sanford asked. ""I think you could probably point to a fair number of indicators that suggest there would be."" President Trump's supporters,even those on the religious right, have largely brushed off his past behaviour and women's accusations against him. But the growing scandal could have a bearing on the midterm elections, with Democrats already making gains in traditionally Republican areas, to the concern of the party. And the Stormy Daniels scandal could see President Trump called in to testify in court - bringing even greater exposure to the case.

The audiotape was recorded in September 2016, two months before the election. The affair allegedly dates to 2006.

Michael Cohen, pleading guilty to electoral finance violations, 21 August 2018 Cohen told a court in New York that he had in fact paid hush money to two women, believed to be Ms Daniels and Ms McDougal, and had done so ""at the direction"" of Mr Trump. Donald Trump, speaking in interview, 23 August July 2018 Mr Trump admitted that the hush money paid by Cohen was his own but argued that the law had not been broken because it had not come out of his campaign funds.

Acid victim 'told accused to kill herself'Berlinah Wallace denies murder and applying a corrosive fluid to Mark van Dongen in Bristol in 2015.2h2 hours agoBristol,"Berlinah Wallace (right) said she and Mark van Dongen argued after he told her he had slept with another woman A man who had sulphuric acid thrown over him said his former partner should kill herself by drinking acid while he watched, a court has heard. Berlinah Wallace, 48, denies murder and applying a corrosive fluid to Mark van Dongen, 29, in Bristol in 2015. He ended his life in a Belgian euthanasia clinic 15 months later. Ms Wallace told Bristol Crown Court Mr van Dongen fetched a bottle of acid from the kitchen during an argument the day before he was allegedly attacked. Under questioning by Richard Smith QC, for the defence, Ms Wallace said she and Mr van Dongen had argued after he told her he had slept with another woman. ""I said 'why don't you just kill me', because I can't have any peace with him,"" Ms Wallace told the court. ""He said I should kill myself. He went into the kitchen and came back with the acid and put it on the table. ""He said 'there you go, you kill yourself - I'll watch'."" Berlinah Wallace denies murder and applying a corrosive fluid to Mr van Dongen Ms Wallace told the court Mr van Dongen had got her a glass of water for her to take her medication. She said she tried to leave the flat after the pair ""bickered"" and he tried to stop her physically from leaving. ""I asked him to stop, he didn't. I wanted something to hit him with. ""I reached for something, got a cup, turned around and threw the water at him."" Mr Smith asked: ""Did you know what was in the glass?"" ""No I didn't. I thought it was water. I just wanted him to stop because he was hurting me,"" Ms Wallace replied. She told the jury Mr van Dongen said ""ooh, you threw acid at me"", and as she turned around while trying to run away she saw ""smoke or something"" coming from him. ""He was saying 'it hurts, it hurts', she said. She told the court Mr van Dongen had a shower and then left the flat. Previously she told the court she had bought a bottle of sulphuric acid in order to clear drains and to ""distress"" fabric. Mr van Dongen was left paralysed from the neck down and lost his left leg, ear and eye following the alleged attack in the early hours of 23 September 2015. The trial continues.

Dwight Yorke in Mirror phone-hacking settlementModel Danielle Lloyd and actress Jennifer Ellison are among those to receive undisclosed damages.3h3 hours agoUK,"The High Court case related to Danielle Lloyd, Jennifer Ellison, Dwight Yorke and Andrew Cole Model Danielle Lloyd and ex-footballer Dwight Yorke are among the latest group of people to receive damages after settling phone-hacking claims with Mirror Group Newspapers (MGN). They, alongside fellow ex-Manchester United footballer Andrew Cole and actress Jennifer Ellison, were paid an undisclosed amount and legal costs. MGN apologised in each case but none of the claimants attended the hearing. The newspaper group has already settled dozens of phone-hacking cases. MGN admitted during the High Court hearing that they had targeted the voicemails of each of the well-known figures and hired private investigators to obtain private information about them, more than a decade ago. The lawyer representing the claimants, Mark Elder, told the court of the emotional distress the hacking had caused them, and that Ellison felt it had damaged her career. Mr Elder, of law firm Shoosmiths, said: ""We're pleased to have resolved these claims against MGN on behalf of our clients. ""Our clients may be in the public eye but they have a right to a private life, which should be respected. ""A settlement has been reached with MGN and our clients are happy with the outcome."" It follows aseries of settlements reached by MGNwith more than 40 celebrities, including TV presenter Davina McCall, and actresses Patsy Kensit, Michelle Collins and Kym Marsh. Actor Hugh Grant is understood to havereceived a six-figure sum from the groupafter settling a claim earlier this year.

"Man jailed over 'bully' boss murderDavid Browning stabbed Jillian Howell to death and wrote ""bully"" on her forehead.1han hour agoSussex","David Browning reacted with anger when Jillian Howell rejected him A man who stabbed his boss to death and wrote ""bully"" on her forehead has been jailed for life and ordered to serve at least 28 years. David Browning, 52, of Seaford, was found guilty of murder at Hove Crown Court on Wednesday. He stabbed Jillian Howell in the chest, neck and abdomen, leaving her with 15 stab and slash wounds in October. Browning had formed an intense attachment to the 46-year-old Brighton university payroll boss, jurors heard. The court was told he had gone to her house for dinner and reacted with anger when she rejected him. Sentencing, Judge Christine Laing QC said the way in which Browning murdered her was ""savage"", adding: ""This was a sustained attack and the terror and trauma for her in the final few minutes of her life is unimaginable."" The judge said Ms Howell ""desperately tried to defend herself"". She said Browning ""defiled"" her body by writing the world ""bully"" on her forehead but added: ""Nothing was further from the truth."" Ms Howell told friends she wanted to help Browning ""The reality of Jillian Howell is that she was a compassionate woman, a quality that cost her her life,"" she said. Ms Laing said Browning had developed a crush that turned into an obsession. The judge told him: ""I am quite satisfied that what led to you killing her was a very ordinary cocktail of human emotions, desire, jealously, frustration and anger."" Jillian Howell with close friend Sean McDonald at Wembley This was illustrated in his vitriol towards Ms Howell's close friend Sean McDonald, who he tried and failed to frame for the killing, she added. ""Jillian did more than most people would have done to support you as a concerned colleague and friend but it is plain you wanted to be more important or special to her than that. ""I have watched you closely during this trial and you have shown no emotion and little remorse other than for your own situation."" He killed his boss after they shared a curry Browning had claimed he and Ms Howell clashed when they first started working together in 2015, but then became friends. The court heard Browning described as the ""epitome of urban normality"" until his father died in 2016, leaving him with depression. Ms Howell told friends she wanted to help him. In the months before the killing, Browning applied for a firearms licence, bought a shotgun and knife, hired a van, deleted messages and data on his phone and took a change of clothes to the crime scene. The court heard the pair shared a curry and then he stabbed her. An image was uploaded to Browning's Facebook page After the killing, he posted a cartoon on Facebook with the slogan ""stand up to bullies, then kill them"", before he phoned the Samaritans. When he handed himself in to police, the father-of-two claimed it was manslaughter by diminished responsibility. Graham Trembath, defending, said Browning showed ""no mercy"" in the inexcusable killing but asked for ""some light at the end of the tunnel"". Ms Laing accepted his diagnosed condition may have played some part, but said he had been rational at the time. Flowers were left at the house in Brighton After the hearing, Mr McDonald described how he felt when he found out Ms Howell had died - and then days later discovered someone had tried to implicate him in the killing. ""I thought beforehand I could not be any more heartbroken but then I was and it completely broke me. ""It hurt me quite deeply that anyone thought I could harm Jill in any way at all."" Describing Ms Howell as ""intensely private"" and ""very unassuming,"" he said: ""It was disgraceful that anyone should try and link me to harming someone so beautiful."" Browning sprayed graffiti on the walls at the crime scene to try to frame Mr McDonald Adding that Ms Howell had been loved by everybody, he said: ""As regards the murderer, I'll never mention his name ever again. I'll never speak about him and he can be forgotten, but every day I'll remember Jill."" Tributes to Ms Howell were also paid by director of Brighton and Hove Samaritans Alison Pratt who said the ""dedicated"" volunteer supported people in distress and played a vital role in recruiting and training.

Doctors warned of killer's knife hoard,"Alexander Palmer was jailed for a minimum of 28 years in March The parents of a mentally ill ex-soldier warned a health trust he was collecting knives before he murdered an 83-year-old dog walker. Alexander Palmer, 24, stabbed Peter Wrighton 45 times in woodland near East Harling, Norfolk, in August. A letter from a Norfolk and Suffolk NHS Foundation Trust psychiatrist said Palmer was told to ""get rid"" of the weapons and would ""hopefully"" comply. The trust said an internal review into the case was under way. Palmer was described as ""dangerous"" when he was sentenced to life in prison for murdering Mr Wrighton, whose injuries were so severe police initially thought he had been killed by an animal. Palmer's parents said their warnings that their son was not taking his medication were ignored because health workers said they could only ""believe the patient"". His mother and stepfather - who do not want to be named - told BBC Look East he had been documented as saying it was ""inevitable"" he would kill. Peter Wrighton was walking his dogs alone when he was set upon from behind by Palmer The parents said they also told mental health professionals Palmer had knives and added the ""severity"" of his illness was not appreciated. ""Alex was purchasing knives. Once he knew I knew that he'd got them, he became more secretive,"" his mother said. In January 2017, Palmer, who lived in Cringleford near Norwich, told his GP he was experiencing more voices telling him to hurt people and had bought a hunting knife and a machete. Palmer, 24, subsequently visited a specialist at the Norfolk and Suffolk NHS Foundation Trust, who wrote to the GP. ""It is in his best interests to get rid of such weapons. Alex is aware of this and understands this and hopefully will act accordingly,"" the specialist wrote. The letter goes on to say that Palmer did not feel driven to act on his violent fantasies. This video can not be played Alexander Palmer's parents tell the BBC's Robby West warnings about their son were ignored Palmer had served in an Army commando regiment but was discharged in November 2015 after his head was ""crushed"" in a violent attack, his parents said. They said he returned home a ""different"" person but received multiple diagnoses from a string of professionals. His mother added: ""It says in the letter 'mum was concerned about what Alex was going to do with those knives'. There was no 'this is a mental health patient with a machete'."" His stepfather said: ""They were talking to him like he was a teenager as opposed to a trained soldier."" Dog walker's killer jailed for 28 years 'Voices' told accused to kill dog walker DNA of accused found on killed dog walker His mother said it had been noted in two reports that her son ""said he is going to kill somebody, how he is going to kill somebody and he's said it's inevitable"". ""They thought we were busybodies, interfering in Alex's mental health and care, because they were the experts,"" she added. Correspondence sent by mental health professionals over a two-year period before the murder documented Palmer's violent fantasies and the voices telling him to harm others. After he was sectioned in 2015 in Peterborough, medical notes said he wanted to ""get rid"" of people in the street by ""stringing them up and cutting them open"". Peter Wrighton's body was discovered on the edge of woodland by walkers A psychologist who treated Palmer at RAF Marham contacted police after reading press reports about Mr Wrighton's murder, saying she thought he could be responsible. His mother said Norfolk and Suffolk NHS Foundation Trust had ""missed chances"" to prevent the killing. ""I am not going to blame them solely, maybe we should have done more, but the amount of times we were treated like we were interfering, it didn't matter how desperate I was,"" she said. Palmer's stepfather added: ""Peter Wrighton paid the price and his family continues to do so."" In a statement, Norfolk and Suffolk NHS Foundation Trust said its independently-chaired internal review was due to finish this summer. It said it would ""incorporate information from all involved, including the families, carers and, of course, clinicians, along with any external parties who may have any relevant information"". ""The trust wishes to offer its continued support to the victim's family and to others who have been affected by these tragic violent events,"" it added. ""It would be inappropriate to pre-judge the findings of any review or to comment any further at this point."" His parents said their concerns about medical treatment for their son were continuing. Before Palmer was convicted, he was held at Rampton Secure Hospital but he is now serving his sentence in the general prison population at Wakefield jail, West Yorkshire. His mother said within two weeks he had carved the word 'help' into his arm and lost two stones. She believed he needed to be transferred to a psychiatric hospital. ""We are aware Alex has committed a horrendous crime... but we both believe he was let down... even now he is not getting any support in prison,""she told the BBC's Today programme. ""He still is an ill person."" The Ministry of Justice said it would not comment on individual cases.

Free speech pledge for universities,"The right to protest and free speech needs clearer guidelines, the universities minister says Free speech in universities has to be protected from ""chilling"" intolerance and ""over-zealous"" regulations, says the Universities Minister, Sam Gyimah. The minister has met university and student leaders on Thursday to create a more straightforward set of guidelines for ensuring open debate on campus. Mr Gyimah warned ""unfashionable or unpopular"" views should not be stifled. Sir Michael Barber, who chairs the Office for Students, said ""challenging"" ideas had a right to be heard. The meeting of higher education groups and government - described as a ""free speech summit"" - is a response to concerns that universities have become hostile places for freedom of expression. There have been warnings about speakers being blocked by so-called ""no platforming"", where it's claimed their views are so offensive that students try to stop them speaking. But when Parliament's Joint Committee on Human Rights investigated, it found that a bigger problem wasred tape and confusion over what was permissible. ""University bureaucracy"" and fear of controversy was inhibiting free speech, said Harriet Harman, who chairs the committee. Sam Gyimah said free speech needed to be protected from ""wreckers"" and ""bureaucrats"" Mr Gyimah is sending a strong message that a culture of censorship is not acceptable - but also that universities need to have a clearer set of rules over what are the boundaries of debate and protest. He describes the current regulations as ""murky"" and lacking in consistency - and for the first time wants a more coherent set of guidelines that can be used across institutions. It's being claimed as the biggest intervention by ministers in campus free speech for more than 30 years. ""A society in which people feel they have a legitimate right to stop someone expressing their views on campus simply because they are unfashionable or unpopular is rather chilling,"" says Mr Gyimah. ""There is a risk that overzealous interpretation of a dizzying variety of rules is acting as a brake on legal free speech on campus. ""That is why I am bringing together leaders from across the higher education sector to clarify the rules and regulations around speakers and events to prevent bureaucrats or wreckers on campus from exploiting gaps for their own ends."" The new higher education watchdog, the Office for Students, has a responsibility for protecting free speech. Jacob Rees-Mogg faced protests at the University of the West of England Sir Michael Barber, who chairs the new regulator, said: ""Our universities are places where free speech should always be promoted and fostered. ""That includes the ability for everyone to share views which may be challenging or unpopular, even if that makes some people feel uncomfortable."" But Alistair Jarvis, chief executive of Universities UK, pointed to the finding of the parliamentary committee that ""there is no systematic problem with free speech in universities"". ""Universities are committed to promoting and protecting free speech within the law. Tens of thousands of speaking events are put on every year across the country, the majority pass without incident,"" he said. The report from MPs and peers on the Joint Committee on Human Rights found that flashpoints tended to be around a number of ""divisive issues"" - such as Israel and the Palestinian territories, ""transgender issues"", right- and left-wing clashes and ""pro-life or anti-abortion views"". But the committee found little evidence that censorship or confrontations were ""pervasive"" - but instead found that a relatively small number of incidents were being widely shared. Among the most high-profile incidents was a protest against Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg, when he was speaking at the University of the West of England. When Mr Rees-Mogg gave evidence to the committee, he saidheckling could help politicians. ""It can actually be very good for the speaker rather than damaging,"" he told the committee. Harriet Harman, who chaired the committee, said: ""The minister is right to recognise the confusing array of guidance on free speech."" She called for an end to the ""confusion of the duties arising from Prevent, charity law, and the Education Act"". ""Education and learning depend on dialogue and debate,"" she said, and free speech ""includes the right to say anything that's lawful, even when others may find it disturbing, upsetting or offensive"".

"Afghan interpreters 'should stay in UK'The defence secretary says he is ""confident"" those who worked with the Army will be able to stay in Britain.7m8 minutes agoUK","Afghan interpreters worked with the Army on the frontline in Helmand Province Afghan interpreters who served with British troops fighting against the Taliban should be able to stay in the UK, the defence secretary has said. More than 150 Afghans given five-year residency permits say they face being sent back to Afghanistan when they expire, unless they pay Â£2,389 to apply for indefinite leave to remain. Gavin Williamson said the Home Office should waive the fees. The UK owed them gratitude, he said, and they had ""every right"" to remain. Afghan interpreter 'will die if deported' BBC reporter killed in Afghanistan attack In a letter to the Home Office and Mr Williamson - which has been seen by the BBC - the interpreters said they had been left in ""limbo"" and urged the government to grant them and their families the right to live in the UK. They accused the government of preventing some of their families from coming to Britain, noting that couples who had had children since arriving were facing problems. The group, who served on the front line in Helmand Province, also called for access to veterans' benefits, war pensions for the wounded and for interpreters left back in Afghanistan to be brought over on the same terms as those now in the UK. Mr Williamson told BBC defence correspondent Jonathan Beale: ""We've made it absolutely clear they should be staying in this country. ""We've been in touch with the Home Office making that position clear, and I'm confident that the Home Office will be supporting us to ensure that that happens as quickly as possible."" When asked if the visa fees - which many interpreters say they cannot pay - will be waived, Mr Williamson said: ""That is our suggestion and we are very confident the Home Office will see the sense in what we are proposing."" The defence secretary said he would be ""amazed"" if interpreters who helped the Army were deported The group behind the letter served with the Army in 2012 and were brought to the UK in 2014 on initial five-year residency permits. Numerous problems have followed, however, with some complaining their uncertain status has prevented them from finding employment. Others whose children have been born in the UK are struggling to obtain documentation for them - and may have to pay Â£1,200 to apply for an Afghan passport and then a British visa. Many interpreters fear their ties to the British forces will endanger them if they return to Afghanistan, withone telling the BBC he believed he would be killed by the Taliban. The defence secretary added that he had ""no doubt"" the matter would be resolved swiftly. The BBC has contacted the Home Office for comment.

"Breast cancer widower's shock over IT errorA man says his wife might have lived if she had not been one of 450,000 women who missed being screened.13h13 hours agoUK","This video can not be played Patricia Minchin says her cancer may have been spotted earlier had she received a screening letter A breast cancer survivor and a man whose wife died from the disease have reacted angrily to revelations that an NHS computer error led to 450,000 people missing screening tests. Patricia Minchin said her ""traumatic journey"" could have been ""avoided"". Brian Gough, whose wife Trixie died in 2015, said she might have survived if her cancer had been diagnosed earlier. A think tank has questioned why the error, for whichthe health secretary has apologised, was not spotted sooner. Women aged between 50 and 70 are supposed to be invited for a mammogram every three years. But about 450,000 women in England aged 68-71 failed to get invitations since 2009 because of a computer error, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt told the Commons. He said the mistake could have shortened the lives of up to 270 women. Breast screening: What went wrong? Breast scan error 'shortened up to 270 lives' Breast screening: For and against Why isn't breast cancer screening totally reliable? Ms Minchin, a former nurse, told the BBC she believed she was one of those who should have got an invitation for a screening, but didn't. She was tested in 2009 when she was 67 but was not called back for a second examination. In 2015 she discovered three lumps in her breast, two of which ""were deep"" and ""had obviously been growing for some time"". Mrs Minchin underwent chemotherapy and radiotherapy in what she called a ""traumatic journey"". She said: ""You can never say it could have been prevented but I really think if I had had a mammogram when I was 70, (the cancer) may have been picked up."" Brian and Trixie Gough had been married for 56 years Brian Gough, 77, said he was shocked by Mr Hunt's revelation. His wife Trixie was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2010, a year after she should have had a scan. The cancer was treated but returned and his wife died three days after Christmas 2015 aged 76. Mr Gough, from Norfolk, said: ""She didn't know anything about it until a year too late."" Call the breast screening helpline number 0800 169 2692 Go theNHS Choices website,externalfor more information You should receive a letter by the end of May He said ""maybe just maybe"" Mrs Gough - to whom he had been married to for 56 years - would have survived if treatment for the first cancer had started earlier. The widower said: ""I can't express how sad it is. ""I know we can't be certain it would have picked up her cancer as it may not have developed or that she would have survived, but it is possible."" Early diagnosis is ""absolutely essential"" according to Baroness Delyth Morgan, chief executive of Breast Cancer Now. She said: ""I feel extremely sad for the women affected by this colossal administrative disaster. ""It's hugely significant, we have to be concerned about confidence in the screening service."" Baroness Morgan said the revelation was ""hugely significant"" Meanwhile, the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) has questioned why a fall in the number of women getting screened did not raise any alarms. In a recent report on the NHS, the IPPR said the number of women who accepted invitations had fallen to 71%, a 10 year low. The IPPR said health chiefs should have examined the data earlier to find out what was happening. An independent review set up by ministers will try to establish who was responsible and whether problems should have been flagged up sooner. All women affected will now be contacted by letter by the end of May and those under 72 will receive an appointment for a catch-up mammogram. Women aged over 72 can contact a helpline to talk through the pros and cons of having breast screening. Scans in older women sometimes pick up cancers which do not require treatment.

Model in Mirror phone-hacking settlement,"The High Court case related to Danielle Lloyd, Jennifer Ellison, Dwight Yorke and Andrew Cole Model Danielle Lloyd and ex-footballer Dwight Yorke are among the latest group of people to receive damages after settling phone-hacking claims with Mirror Group Newspapers (MGN). They, alongside fellow ex-Manchester United footballer Andrew Cole and actress Jennifer Ellison, were paid an undisclosed amount and legal costs. MGN apologised in each case but none of the claimants attended the hearing. The newspaper group has already settled dozens of phone-hacking cases. MGN admitted during the High Court hearing that they had targeted the voicemails of each of the well-known figures and hired private investigators to obtain private information about them, more than a decade ago. The lawyer representing the claimants, Mark Elder, told the court of the emotional distress the hacking had caused them, and that Ellison felt it had damaged her career. Mr Elder, of law firm Shoosmiths, said: ""We're pleased to have resolved these claims against MGN on behalf of our clients. ""Our clients may be in the public eye but they have a right to a private life, which should be respected. ""A settlement has been reached with MGN and our clients are happy with the outcome."" It follows aseries of settlements reached by MGNwith more than 40 celebrities, including TV presenter Davina McCall, and actresses Patsy Kensit, Michelle Collins and Kym Marsh.

Lockerbie bomber conviction to be reviewed,"Abdelbaset al-Megrahi is the only person to have been convicted of the 1988 bombing A review of Abdelbaset al-Megrahi's conviction for the Lockerbie bombing is to be carried out by the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission. The commission said it would examine the case to decide whether it would be appropriate to refer the matter for a fresh appeal. Megrahi was jailed for 27 years in 2001 for the 1988 bombing of Pan Am flight 103 which killed 270 people. He died in 2012 after being released on compassionate grounds in 2009. Timeline: Lockerbie bombing Megrahi lost an appeal against his conviction in 2002, with the SCCRC recommending in 2007 that he should be granted a second appeal. He dropped the second attempt to overturn his conviction in 2009, ahead of his return to Libya. He continued to protest his innocence until his death. Megrahi was permitted to return to Libya on compassionate grounds after he was diagnosed with terminal cancer. SCCRC chief executive Gerard Sinclair said the commission believed Megrahi abandoned his appeal as he believed that would allow him to return to Libya. ""In any application where an applicant has previously chosen to abandon an appeal against conviction the commission will, at the first stage of its process, look carefully at the reasons why the appeal was abandoned and consider whether it is in the interests of justice to allow a further review of the conviction,"" he said. ""The commission has now investigated this particular matter and interviewed the key personnel who were involved in the process at the time the previous appeal was abandoned in 2009. ""The commission has also sought access to the relevant materials and has recovered the vast majority of these, including the defence papers which were not provided during its previous review. ""Having considered all the available evidence the commission believes that Mr Megrahi, in abandoning his appeal, did so as he held a genuine and reasonable belief that such a course of action would result in him being able to return home to Libya, at a time when he was suffering from terminal cancer. ""On that basis, the commission has decided that it is in the interests of justice to accept the current application for a full review of his conviction."" In December it will be 30 years since the bombing, Britain's worst terrorist outrage. After a trial in the Netherlands Megrahi was the only man to be convicted - but following a four-year investigation by the SCCRC, he began a second appeal which he abandoned in 2009. Why he did this has always been a matter for conjecture. Many people point to the""Deal in the Desert"" between Tony Blair and the Libyan leader Colonel Gadaffi,externalas forming part of the pressure put on the Scottish government. Its Justice Secretary, Kenny MacAskill visited Megrahi in Greenock Prison shortly before the appeal was dropped, and then came the surprise announcement that Megrahi was to be freed from prison on compassionate grounds, because of his terminal prostate cancer. Now the application by Megrahi's family for a review of the case has been accepted, the SCCRC will take several months to sift through the evidence before it, including the original six grounds of appeal. These include doubts over a witness who identified Megrahi as the bomber, and crucial evidence of the fragment of bomb timer recovered from the ground. If the commission agrees there might have been a miscarriage of justice, the case will return yet again to the court of appeal. The Pan Am flight from London to New York exploded 31,000 feet over Lockerbie, 38 minutes after take-off from London on 21 December 1988. The 259 people on board the Boeing 747 were killed, along with 11 people on the ground. Megrahi was found guilty of 270 counts of murder in 2001, after a historic trial under Scots law at a special court in the Netherlands. He is the only person to have been found guilty of Britain's worst act of terrorism. Megrahi continued to protest his innocence until his death in Libya in 2012. His family made an application to the SCCRC to have his conviction overturned last July. Their solicitor Aamer Anwar told BBC Scotland they had endured ""a long journey in the pursuit for truth and justice"". He added: ""When Mr Megrahi abandoned his appeal it simply didn't make sense. He had maintained his innocence until his dying breath, so nobody could understand why all of sudden he would drop it. ""There have always been allegations that the UK government applied pressure to him and others, including the Libyan government, over the appeal. That is a matter that will be addressed at a later stage. ""But the commission has accepted there was a genuine and reasonable belief by Mr Megrahi that unless he dropped his appeal then he would simply die in prison in Scotland."" He said the family's application to the SCCRC was supported by Jim Swire, who lost his 23-year-old daughter Flora in the bombing; the Rev John F Mosey, whose 19-year-old daughter Helga died; and ""many other British relatives of passengers who died on board Pan Am Flight 103"".

"'Why I revealed my friends' racist messages'Law students were expelled from Exeter University after a fellow student revealed their ""vile"" comments.","Arsalan Motavali says he has no regrets about his decision to go public with the ""vile"" WhatsApp messages ""It went from crude humour to racial slurs. Awful things were said about rape. Every group was targeted."" Exeter University student Arsalan Motavali is talking about the WhatsApp group he was in with fellow members of the university's law society. ""[The messages] started to get progressively worse after certain people were added."" Five months on and several of them have beenexpelledafter Arsalan's post of their ""vile"" screen shots went viral. Speaking to Newsbeat, the 21-year-old said he had no regrets about his decision to go public. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Rewind to November 2017 and Arsalan was a member of a WhatsApp group with other people in the university's Bracton Law Society But the tone of the messages turned nasty - and Arsalan decided to post some of them to Facebook. They were shared thousands of times. The messages were sent between members of the Bracton Law Society ""It got too much for me so I just left the group chat and forwarded the messages to some of my [non-university] friends. ""I told them about everything that had happened and they were horrified. Arsalan's friends advised him to complain to Exeter University, but he says he just didn't get round to it immediately. ""I left it on the back burner for a while because I had essays to write, it was a busy time."" The next step was when Arsalan showed the messages to some of his university friends. He said they were horrified by what they saw: ""We talked about going through the university but one of my friends had had a far worse situation and it was a five-month investigation and an outcome that was incredibly vague. ""I've always been a massive advocate of freedom of speech [but] there is also an integrity you need to have as someone who wants to practise in the legal field. ""You should know the consequences of the statements you're making."" As well as being racist, sexist and bigoted, one of the messages targeted someone who'd been stabbed at university. ""Ignorant jokes are one thing, and genuinely appearing to have some form of prejudice towards people of colour is a total other thing."" This excerpt from the group chat appeared to reference the dark comedy film Four Lions After the investigation was finished an email was sent to students and staff by university officials. It explained expulsions, suspensions and other sanctions had been used. But there was no comment on how many people had been expelled. Arsalan says he thinks the investigation was handled well. ""I believe it was, because what if in the future my kid goes for an interview with a law firm and sits opposite one of those individuals? ""Regardless of how much they say they don't hold those views, those prejudices are still there - I've seen it first hand. ""I don't think I've fixed [the problem] but I feel like a conversation has been opened up."" Follow Newsbeat onInstagram,external,Facebook,externalandTwitter,external.

Man jailed over 'bully' boss murder,"David Browning reacted with anger when Jillian Howell rejected him A man who stabbed his boss to death and wrote ""bully"" on her forehead has been jailed for life and ordered to serve at least 28 years. David Browning, 52, of Seaford, was found guilty of murder at Hove Crown Court on Wednesday. He stabbed Jillian Howell in the chest, neck and abdomen, leaving her with 15 stab and slash wounds in October. Browning had formed an intense attachment to the 46-year-old Brighton university payroll boss, jurors heard. The court was told he had gone to her house for dinner and reacted with anger when she rejected him. Sentencing, Judge Christine Laing QC said the way in which Browning murdered her was ""savage"", adding: ""This was a sustained attack and the terror and trauma for her in the final few minutes of her life is unimaginable."" The judge said Ms Howell ""desperately tried to defend herself"". She said Browning ""defiled"" her body by writing the world ""bully"" on her forehead but added: ""Nothing was further from the truth."" Ms Howell told friends she wanted to help Browning ""The reality of Jillian Howell is that she was a compassionate woman, a quality that cost her her life,"" she said. Ms Laing said Browning had developed a crush that turned into an obsession. The judge told him: ""I am quite satisfied that what led to you killing her was a very ordinary cocktail of human emotions, desire, jealously, frustration and anger."" Jillian Howell with close friend Sean McDonald at Wembley This was illustrated in his vitriol towards Ms Howell's close friend Sean McDonald, who he tried and failed to frame for the killing, she added. ""Jillian did more than most people would have done to support you as a concerned colleague and friend but it is plain you wanted to be more important or special to her than that. ""I have watched you closely during this trial and you have shown no emotion and little remorse other than for your own situation."" He killed his boss after they shared a curry Browning had claimed he and Ms Howell clashed when they first started working together in 2015, but then became friends. The court heard Browning described as the ""epitome of urban normality"" until his father died in 2016, leaving him with depression. Ms Howell told friends she wanted to help him. In the months before the killing, Browning applied for a firearms licence, bought a shotgun and knife, hired a van, deleted messages and data on his phone and took a change of clothes to the crime scene. The court heard the pair shared a curry and then he stabbed her. An image was uploaded to Browning's Facebook page After the killing, he posted a cartoon on Facebook with the slogan ""stand up to bullies, then kill them"", before he phoned the Samaritans. When he handed himself in to police, the father-of-two claimed it was manslaughter by diminished responsibility. Graham Trembath, defending, said Browning showed ""no mercy"" in the inexcusable killing but asked for ""some light at the end of the tunnel"". Ms Laing accepted his diagnosed condition may have played some part, but said he had been rational at the time. Flowers were left at the house in Brighton After the hearing, Mr McDonald described how he felt when he found out Ms Howell had died - and then days later discovered someone had tried to implicate him in the killing. ""I thought beforehand I could not be any more heartbroken but then I was and it completely broke me. ""It hurt me quite deeply that anyone thought I could harm Jill in any way at all."" Describing Ms Howell as ""intensely private"" and ""very unassuming,"" he said: ""It was disgraceful that anyone should try and link me to harming someone so beautiful."" Browning sprayed graffiti on the walls at the crime scene to try to frame Mr McDonald Adding that Ms Howell had been loved by everybody, he said: ""As regards the murderer, I'll never mention his name ever again. I'll never speak about him and he can be forgotten, but every day I'll remember Jill."" Tributes to Ms Howell were also paid by director of Brighton and Hove Samaritans Alison Pratt who said the ""dedicated"" volunteer supported people in distress and played a vital role in recruiting and training. ""We know that it will continue to be very difficult for Jill's family and friends, and our thoughts are with them,"" she said. ""We will remember her as a warm, compassionate and committed member of the team.""

Criminal probe into Vauxhall Zafira firesA government agency confirms a criminal probe into fires that affected the Vauxhall Zafira.4h4 hours agoBusiness,"Firefighters extinguish a Vauxhall Zafira which caught light in south west London A criminal investigation has been launched into Vauxhall Zafira fires, the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) has confirmed. A Transport Committee report last yearsaid the carmaker was too slow to begin a full investigation into fires affecting Zafira B models. The DVSA has teamed up with Luton Borough Council's trading standards officers to investigate Vauxhall. Vauxhall is understood to be complying with the investigation. The carmaker - which has its headquarters in Luton - says 92% of the affected models have been recalled. In a statement, the government agency said: ""DVSA's priority is to protect you from unsafe drivers and vehicles. ""We have made it clear to manufacturers that to protect consumers, they should swiftly rectify problems and meet their obligations under the code of practice. ""DVSA will take the necessary action against any manufacturers who fail to comply with their obligations."" The first reported incident of a Zafira catching fire was noted by Vauxhall in 2009, but it took until August 2015 for the carmaker to launch an investigation, after recording 161 reports of fires. In some cases, the fires were serious enough to destroy the entire vehicle, and victims were left with mere seconds to escape. To date, no one has been seriously injured in one of the vehicle fires, In November 2015, Vauxhall issueda recall for 200,000 Zafira B cars, and thena second recall for 234,000 carsof the same model in May 2016. The carmaker said the fires were caused by ""unauthorised repair"" of the thermal fuse in the vehicle's blower resistor. MPs in the Transport Committee concluded in their report that Vauxhall had shown ""a reckless disregard for safety"" of drivers.

Trump 'repaid porn actor's hush money',"Mr Trump has previously said he knew nothing of the payment to Ms Daniels President Donald Trump personally repaid his lawyer the $130,000 that was used to buy an adult film actor's silence about an alleged affair, his legal aide Rudy Giuliani has said. It appears to contradict Mr Trump, who said he did not know about the payment made by lawyer Michael Cohen to Stormy Daniels ahead of the 2016 election. Mr Trump has denied Ms Daniels' claims of an affair in 2006. Mr Giuliani said no campaign finance was used, a key issue in the matter. Should Trump be worried about Stormy Daniels? The president and the porn star: Why this matters What are non-disclosure agreements? The former New York City mayor recently joined Mr Trump's legal team and was talking to Sean Hannity on Fox News. The campaign finance issue appeared to be one his main motives for appearing on the programme - to deny that there was any wrongdoing. Allow Twitter content?

Mr Cohen's $130,000 (Â£95,650) payment to Ms Daniels just before the 2016 election could count as an illegal contribution to President Trump's campaign. Mr Giuliani said: ""That money was not campaign money. Sorry, I'm giving you a fact now that you don't know. It's not campaign money. No campaign finance violation. ""They funnelled it through a law firm and the president repaid it."" He added that the president ""didn't know about the specifics of it, as far as I know, but he did know about the general arrangement that Michael would take care of things like this"". Mr Giulianilater spoke to the New York Times,external, saying: ""Some time after the campaign is over, they set up a reimbursement, $35,000 a month, out of his personal family account."" The sum paid was $460,000-$470,000, including expenses, he said. He also said Mr Trump was aware of what he was going to say on Fox News and that he had spoken to the president before and after the interview. US federal law restricts how much individuals and organisations can contribute to campaign financing and there are also strict regulations on the disclosure of the financing. The first question is whether the payment to Ms Daniels was campaign related.Legal expert Lawrence Noble told the Washington Post,external: ""If the purpose of this was to stop [Daniels] from hurting the campaign, then what you have is Cohen made a loan to the campaign."" The $130,000 would exceed the amount an individual can donate to a presidential campaign. Michael Cohen is facing a criminal investigation over the matter Any repayment by the Trump campaign would violate the law. But presidential candidates are allowed to contribute an unlimited amount to their own campaign. Mr Trump may be arguing, through Mr Giuliani, that the personal nature of the repayment makes it legal. However, if the $130,000 is deemed to have been a loan, the president could face questions as to why his personal financial disclosure form from June 2017 made no mention of any debt to Mr Cohen. The repayment would have had to be disclosed to the Federal Election Commission if it were an election-related expense. A wilful violation could be a crime. Ms Daniels' lawyer said it would need to be determined whether the payment was hidden in such a way as to violate anti-money laundering statutes. When asked by reporters a month ago if he knew about the payment to Ms Daniels, Mr Trump said: ""No."" When asked why the payment was given to Ms Daniels, he added: ""You'll have to ask Michael Cohen."" The president might argue that the lawyer ""took care of things like this"", as Mr Giuliani suggested and that he knew nothing of the ""specifics"", making the repayment personally later. Mr Giuliani told the Times he did not know whether Mr Trump was aware of the payment to Ms Daniels at the time but his understanding was that the president had only learned about it recently. It is unclear how this fits with his statement that repayments were made over several months. Speaking on Fox TV last week, Mr Trump suggested some knowledge of the matter in admitting Mr Cohen had represented him during the ""crazy Stormy Daniels deal"", but did not go into specifics. Mr Cohen, for his part,told the New York Times in February,external: ""Neither the Trump Organization nor the Trump campaign was a party to the transaction with Ms Clifford, and neither reimbursed me for the payment, either directly or indirectly."" How this relates to any personal repayments by Mr Trump is unclear. Ms Daniels' lawyer, Michael Avenatti, said that Americans ""should be outraged"" at Mr Giuliani's comments. ""We predicted months ago that it would be proven that the American people had been lied to as to the $130k payment and what Mr Trump knew,"" he wrote on Twitter. He told Associated Press: ""Mr Trump evidently has participated in a felony and there must be serious consequences for his conduct and his lies and deception to the American people."" Analysis by BBC's Anthony Zurcher in Washington There are two ways to look at Rudy Giuliani's blockbuster revelation. The first is that the former New York mayor was freelancing and caught the president and the White House communications team flatfooted. In that case, Mr Giuliani's brief return to the political spotlight will be short-lived. The other possibility is that this was a pre-planned revelation in the friendly confines of Sean Hannity's Fox News talk show. Some in the White House may have been caught by surprise, but there was a strategy in play. Perhaps Mr Giuliani and the president decided that the legal exposure from hiding that Mr Trump made the payment was more dangerous than the political risk from admitting he cut the cheque and lied about it. Mr Trump has proven bulletproof when it comes to most political scandals and this one may prove no different, although the Stormy saga has proven to have staying power. Even with the revelation, the president and Mr Cohen's payment may still constitute a campaign finance law violation. The Stormy clouds aren't going away. The payment relates to allegations by Ms Daniels that she had sex with Mr Trump in 2006, allegations he denies. After initially denying the payment, Mr Cohen eventually admitted he had paid the sum privately to Ms Daniels, real name Stephanie Clifford, in October 2016 out of his own funds in exchange for her silence in a non-disclosure agreement. This video can not be played Stormy Daniels: ""I was threatened"" He denied that Mr Trump was a party to the transaction. Mr Cohen is now facing a criminal investigation. FBI agents searched his home and office in New York recently in relation to the nondisclosure agreement. In March this year, Ms Daniels filed a lawsuit against the president, alleging that the agreement was invalid because Mr Trump did not sign it. She later lost a court motion for Mr Trump to give sworn testimony about her claim that they had a relationship. While Mr Trump has denied her claims, his lawyers are seeking $20m in damages from Ms Daniels, arguing she broke the non-disclosure deal. Ms Daniels is also suing the president over a ""defamatory"" tweet he posted after she said she was threatened by a man in a Las Vegas car park to drop her allegations of the affair. Mr Trump said her claims were ""a total con job"". Trump sued for 'defamatory' tweet Should Trump be worried about Stormy Daniels?

Trump: No campaign cash paid to porn actor,"President Donald Trump has denied money used to buy a porn star's silence came from election campaign funds. He admitted, in a series of tweets, that lawyer Michael Cohen had paid off Stormy Daniels during the campaign and that he was reimbursed. It was the first time the president has referred directly to the payment, although he remains adamant there was no affair with Ms Daniels. Use of campaign funds would be a violation of federal law. Earlier, his legal aide Rudy Giuliani had said the money was Mr Trump's personal cash. Should Trump be worried about Stormy Daniels? The president and the porn star: Why this matters The president fired off three tweets on Thursday morning, focusing on the reimbursement and a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) with Daniels.

Mr Trump's argument appears to be that the NDA was a typical agreement entered into by celebrities and therefore not an election-related matter. This could be crucial in determining whether the $130,000 (Â£95,650) paid to Ms Daniels was legal. The actress says she had an affair with Mr Trump in 2006 and she slept with him once. In a particularly feisty White House daily news conference on Thursday, press secretary Sarah Sanders was asked when she became aware that Mr Trump had repaid Mr Cohen the money. ""The first awareness I had was during the [Giuliani] interview last night,"" she said. This video can not be played On 5 April Donald Trump said ""I don't know"" about a payment to Stormy Daniels When asked by reporters a month ago if he knew about the payment to Ms Daniels, Mr Trump said: ""No."" When asked why the payment was given to Ms Daniels, he added: ""You'll have to ask Michael Cohen."" The conflicting statements Speaking on Fox TV last week, Mr Trump suggested some knowledge of the matter in admitting Mr Cohen had represented him during the ""crazy Stormy Daniels deal"", but he did not go into specifics. Mr Cohen, for his part,told the New York Times in February,external: ""Neither the Trump Organization nor the Trump campaign was a party to the transaction with Ms Clifford, and neither reimbursed me for the payment, either directly or indirectly."" How this relates to any alleged personal repayments by Mr Trump is unclear. Mr Cohen is facing a criminal investigation. FBI agents searched his home and office in New York recently in relation to the NDA. By Anthony Zurcher, senior North America correspondent Donald Trump's April assertion that he had no idea where Michael Cohen found the money to secure Stormy Daniels' silence seems, to borrow a phrase from Nixon administration press secretary Ron Ziegler, ""no longer operative"". White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders stated in March that the president had ""no knowledge of any payments"". Now she's saying she can't comment on the situation. Michael Cohen - before he cited the Fifth Amendment in court to avoid self-incriminating testimony - insisted that he made the Daniels payment out of his own pocket. Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, a new arrival on the president's personal legal team, says Mr Trump reimbursed Mr Cohen for the payment over the course of 2017 and was tasked with handling ""things like this"". Someone has lied or is lying to protect Donald Trump. The questions are who - and why. Michael Avenatti, Daniels' lawyer, says his client has evidence that will prove the veracity of their claims. Mr Trump, in his tweets, promises a lawsuit to enforce Daniels' silence about what he calls ""false and extortionist accusations"". This White House storm shows no signs of ending anytime soon. The big question at heart of Stormy Daniels saga This video can not be played White House weighs in on Stormy Daniels US federal law restricts how much individuals and organisations can contribute to campaign financing, and there are also strict regulations on the disclosure of the financing. The key question may be whether the money was used to prevent Mr Trump's reputation being harmed during the campaign, and therefore be deemed as related to the election. Legal expert Lawrence Noble told the Washington Post,external: ""If the purpose of this was to stop [Daniels] from hurting the campaign, then what you have is Cohen made a loan to the campaign."" The $130,000 would exceed the amount an individual can donate to a presidential campaign. Any repayment by the Trump campaign would violate the law.

If the $130,000 were deemed to have been a loan to Mr Cohen, the president would only have had to disclose the repayment to the Federal Election Commission if it were an election-related expense. There is no mention of any debt to Mr Cohen on Mr Trump's personal financial disclosure form from June 2017. Former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani recently joined Mr Trump's legal team and had earlier been interviewed by Sean Hannity on Fox News, surprising many with his comments. He was the first to say Mr Trump repaid the money. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Patricia Minchin said her ""traumatic journey"" could have been ""avoided"". Brian Gough, whose wife Trixie died in 2015, said she might have survived if her cancer had been diagnosed earlier. A think tank has questioned why the error, for whichthe health secretary has apologised, was not spotted sooner. Women aged between 50 and 70 are supposed to be invited for a mammogram every three years. But about 450,000 women in England aged 68-71 failed to get invitations since 2009 because of a computer error, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt told the Commons. He said the mistake could have shortened the lives of up to 270 women. Breast screening: What went wrong? Breast scan error 'shortened up to 270 lives' Breast screening: For and against Why isn't breast cancer screening totally reliable? Ms Minchin, a former nurse, told the BBC she believed she was one of those who should have got an invitation for a screening, but didn't. She was tested in 2009 when she was 67 but was not called back for a second examination. In 2015 she discovered three lumps in her breast, two of which ""were deep"" and ""had obviously been growing for some time"". Mrs Minchin underwent chemotherapy and radiotherapy in what she called a ""traumatic journey"". She said: ""You can never say it could have been prevented but I really think if I had had a mammogram when I was 70, (the cancer) may have been picked up."" Brian and Trixie Gough had been married for 56 years Brian Gough, 77, said he was shocked by Mr Hunt's revelation. His wife Trixie was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2010, a year after she should have had a scan. The cancer was treated but returned and his wife died three days after Christmas 2015 aged 76. Mr Gough, from Norfolk, said: ""She didn't know anything about it until a year too late."" Call the breast screening helpline number 0800 169 2692 Go theNHS Choices website,externalfor more information You should receive a letter by the end of May He said ""maybe just maybe"" Mrs Gough - to whom he had been married to for 56 years - would have survived if treatment for the first cancer had started earlier. The widower said: ""I can't express how sad it is. ""I know we can't be certain it would have picked up her cancer as it may not have developed or that she would have survived, but it is possible."" Early diagnosis is ""absolutely essential"" according to Baroness Delyth Morgan, chief executive of Breast Cancer Now. She said: ""I feel extremely sad for the women affected by this colossal administrative disaster. ""It's hugely significant, we have to be concerned about confidence in the screening service."" Baroness Morgan said the revelation was ""hugely significant"" Meanwhile, the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) has questioned why a fall in the number of women getting screened did not raise any alarms. In a recent report on the NHS, the IPPR said the number of women who accepted invitations had fallen to 71%, a 10 year low. The IPPR said health chiefs should have examined the data earlier to find out what was happening. An independent review set up by ministers will try to establish who was responsible and whether problems should have been flagged up sooner. All women affected will now be contacted by letter by the end of May and those under 72 will receive an appointment for a catch-up mammogram. Women aged over 72 can contact a helpline to talk through the pros and cons of having breast screening. Scans in older women sometimes pick up cancers which do not require treatment.

Criminal probe into Vauxhall Zafira fires,"Firefighters extinguish a Vauxhall Zafira which caught light in south west London A criminal investigation has been launched into Vauxhall Zafira fires, the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) has confirmed. A Transport Committee report last yearsaid the carmaker was too slow to begin a full investigation into fires affecting Zafira B models. The DVSA has teamed up with Luton Borough Council's trading standards officers to investigate Vauxhall. Vauxhall is understood to be complying with the investigation. The carmaker - which has its headquarters in Luton - says 92% of the affected models have been recalled. In a statement, the government agency said: ""DVSA's priority is to protect you from unsafe drivers and vehicles. ""We have made it clear to manufacturers that to protect consumers, they should swiftly rectify problems and meet their obligations under the code of practice. ""DVSA will take the necessary action against any manufacturers who fail to comply with their obligations."" The first reported incident of a Zafira catching fire was noted by Vauxhall in 2009, but it took until August 2015 for the carmaker to launch an investigation, after recording 161 reports of fires. In some cases, the fires were serious enough to destroy the entire vehicle, and victims were left with mere seconds to escape. To date, no one has been seriously injured in one of the vehicle fires, In November 2015, Vauxhall issueda recall for 200,000 Zafira B cars, and thena second recall for 234,000 carsof the same model in May 2016. The carmaker said the fires were caused by ""unauthorised repair"" of the thermal fuse in the vehicle's blower resistor. MPs in the Transport Committee concluded in their report that Vauxhall had shown ""a reckless disregard for safety"" of drivers.

Father visits missing toddler excavation site,"Katrice Lee went missing on her second birthday while out shopping with her mother The father of a toddler who disappeared in Germany almost 37 years ago has revisited the area near where she was last seen. Two-year-old Katrice Lee, from Hartlepool, went missing from a Naafi supermarketnear Paderborn, in 1981. Richard Lee described his visit to an excavation site on the banks of the River Alme as ""a return to his nightmare"". About 100 police and military personnel are involved in the new search. Mr Lee, from Hartlepool, and Katrice's mother Sharon Lee, from Gosport, Hampshire, have always claimed the youngster was abducted. Heavy equipment arrived on Monday to begin the excavation of a 328ft (100m) stretch of the riverbank in Paderborn. Excavation work began at the search site on Monday Richard Lee was at the dig site as the work got under way RMP officials say the search will last about five weeks Mr Lee travelled from Hartlepool with the town's MP Mike Hill, who lobbied the Ministry of Defence to sanction the fresh search. He said: ""We've just got to do this. I don't want them to find anything, but honestly, I am struggling. ""It's a killer, absolutely a killer. It's a return to my nightmare. ""If Katrice is living a lie, which I believe she is and she is living and being brought up with another family and speaking a different language, she may actually pick up this information and say 'yes that's me'. ""I've always felt Katrice is out there, that's she's living a lie, but unfortunately this rocks our faith a little bit and for five weeks we are going to live in the dark until we get the results."" Last night when we walked down to the scene of the search for the first time, I saw that nightmare being re-lived. It was in his voice and it was in his tears. He's a military man and he knows how to fight. For the last seven years I've been following that fight, interviewing him on dozens of occasions. Always measured, always in control of his message and the injustice he feels Katrice and his family have been served. Last night, as we stood at the banks of the Alme, I saw, just for a few minutes, that fight make way for the raw agony of what's unfolded over the last 36 years. Met with the emotionally brutal sight of the work going on to find his little girl's body, it became almost too much for him. He still says he doesn't believe the search will find Katrice but he's facing this scene for her. Mr Lee, a former sergeant major who was stationed at the German base, has welcomed the search, but said it should have been undertaken years ago. Katrice went missing on 28 November - her second birthday - while out shopping with her mother. Mr Lee addressed the media at a press conference at the dig site About 100 police and military personnel are involved in the search Police said this man was seen putting a child in a green saloon car near where Katrice Lee disappeared In 2012, Royal Military Police chiefs admitted mistakes were made during the initial investigation. Border guards were not informed when Katrice disappeared, statements from shop workers were not taken until six weeks later and information about an eye condition Katrice had was not made known. The River Alme site was identified after the release of an age-progressed photo-fit of a man seen near the Naafi shop holding a child similar to Katrice. He was seen parked in a green car on a bridge over the river the day after she went missing. Mr Lee told media he had faith in the current investigation but he remained angry at the previous failings. ""I feel we are singing off the same song sheet for the first time for a long time,"" he said. ""Do I forgive them? The answer is, categorically, no, I do not and I never will.""

"Man jailed over 'bully' boss murderDavid Browning stabbed Jillian Howell to death and wrote ""bully"" on her forehead.14m15 minutes agoSussex","David Browning reacted with anger when Jillian Howell rejected him A man who stabbed his boss to death and wrote ""bully"" on her forehead has been jailed for life and ordered to serve at least 28 years. David Browning, 52, of Seaford, was found guilty of murder at Hove Crown Court on Wednesday. He stabbed Jillian Howell in the chest, neck and abdomen, leaving her with 15 stab and slash wounds in October. Browning had formed an intense attachment to the 46-year-old Brighton university payroll boss, jurors heard. The court was told he had gone to her house for dinner and reacted with anger when she rejected him. Sentencing, Judge Christine Laing QC said the way in which Browning murdered her was ""savage"", adding: ""This was a sustained attack and the terror and trauma for her in the final few minutes of her life is unimaginable."" The judge said Ms Howell ""desperately tried to defend herself"". She said Browning ""defiled"" her body by writing the world ""bully"" on her forehead but added: ""Nothing was further from the truth."" Ms Howell told friends she wanted to help Browning ""The reality of Jillian Howell is that she was a compassionate woman, a quality that cost her her life,"" she said. Ms Laing said Browning had developed a crush that turned into an obsession. The judge told him: ""I am quite satisfied that what led to you killing her was a very ordinary cocktail of human emotions, desire, jealously, frustration and anger."" Jillian Howell with close friend Sean McDonald at Wembley This was illustrated in his vitriol towards Ms Howell's close friend Sean McDonald, who he tried and failed to frame for the killing, she added. ""Jillian did more than most people would have done to support you as a concerned colleague and friend but it is plain you wanted to be more important or special to her than that. ""I have watched you closely during this trial and you have shown no emotion and little remorse other than for your own situation."" He killed his boss after they shared a curry Browning had claimed he and Ms Howell clashed when they first started working together in 2015, but then became friends. The court heard Browning described as the ""epitome of urban normality"" until his father died in 2016, leaving him with depression. Ms Howell told friends she wanted to help him. In the months before the killing, Browning applied for a firearms licence, bought a shotgun and knife, hired a van, deleted messages and data on his phone and took a change of clothes to the crime scene. The court heard the pair shared a curry and then he stabbed her. An image was uploaded to Browning's Facebook page After the killing, he posted a cartoon on Facebook with the slogan ""stand up to bullies, then kill them"", before he phoned the Samaritans. When he handed himself in to police, the father-of-two claimed it was manslaughter by diminished responsibility. Graham Trembath, defending, said Browning showed ""no mercy"" in the inexcusable killing but asked for ""some light at the end of the tunnel"". Ms Laing accepted his diagnosed condition may have played some part, but said he had been rational at the time. Flowers were left at the house in Brighton After the hearing, Mr McDonald described how he felt when he found out Ms Howell had died - and then days later discovered someone had tried to implicate him in the killing. ""I thought beforehand I could not be any more heartbroken but then I was and it completely broke me. ""It hurt me quite deeply that anyone thought I could harm Jill in any way at all."" Describing Ms Howell as ""intensely private"" and ""very unassuming,"" he said: ""It was disgraceful that anyone should try and link me to harming someone so beautiful."" Browning sprayed graffiti on the walls at the crime scene to try to frame Mr McDonald Adding that Ms Howell had been loved by everybody, he said: ""As regards the murderer, I'll never mention his name ever again. I'll never speak about him and he can be forgotten, but every day I'll remember Jill."" Tributes to Ms Howell were also paid by director of Brighton and Hove Samaritans Alison Pratt who said the ""dedicated"" volunteer supported people in distress and played a vital role in recruiting and training.

"What we know about North Korea's US detaineesThe trio were held for 'hostile acts' in North Korea, but they may be closer to release.8h8 hours agoAsia","One of the three men who have been reportedly relocated, Kim Dong-chul, was sentenced to 10 years' hard labour after appearing before the media to confess in March 2016 Three Americans detained in North Korea are on their way home after being released in what is likely to be a goodwill gesture ahead of unprecedented talks between the leaders of US and North Korea. US President Donald Trump tweeted: ""I am pleased to inform you that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is in the air and on his way back from North Korea with the 3 wonderful gentlemen that everyone is looking so forward to meeting."" Their release came after a meeting between Mr Pompeo and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. Just asking! Trump floats Korea border idea The tricky task of preparing for the Trump-Kim summit Will we ever know what happened to Otto Warmbier? A White House statement said the three men appeared to be in good health and were able to walk on to their plane unassisted. The only other US prisoner to be released by North Korea under Donald Trump's presidency was university student Otto Warmbier, who returned to the US in a coma and died days later. Two of the newly released detainees were jailed in 2017, after Mr Trump became president. Here is what we know about the three men. Kim Hak-song worked at the Pyongyang University of Science and Technology (PUST)and was held on suspicion of ""hostile acts"" on 6 May 2017. He was reportedly detained while in Pyongyang Station. The university, which mostly teaches the children of North Korea's elite, was founded in 2010 by a Korean-American Christian entrepreneur, with much of the costs funded by US and South Korea Christian charities. Several foreign lecturers are thought to teach there. This video can not be played Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un: From enemies to frenemies Kim Hak-song had previously described himself as a Christian missionary who intended to start an experimental farm at PUST, Reuters news agency reported, citing an online post by Mr Kim. He is, reports say, an ethnic Korean born just across the North Korean border in China who emigrated to the US in the 1990s. He is said to have gone on to study agriculture in Yanbian, a Chinese prefecture which borders North Korea, before moving to Pyongyang. Two weeks before Kim Hak-song was arrested, Kim Sang-duk - also known as Tony Kim -was detained on espionage charges. He was trying to leave the country after spending a month working at PUST. South Korean media said he was 55 and had been involved in humanitarian work in the North. ""Some officials at PUST told me his arrest was not related to his work at PUST,"" the chancellor of the university, Chan-Mo Park, told Reuters news agency. Tony Kim was detained on espionage charges ""He had been involved with some other activities outside PUST, such as helping an orphanage."" Mr Kim studied accounting at two American universities and had worked as an accountant in the US for more than a decade, his Facebook page says. He had also taught in Yanbian. A South Korea-born US citizen, Kim Dong-chul is a pastor in his early 60s. He was detained in 2015 on spying chargesand sentenced to 10 years' hard labour in 2016. Before his trial, he was presented at a government-arranged press conference, where he apparently confessed to stealing military secrets in collusion with South Korea - a claim rejected by Seoul. In an interview with CNN in January 2016,external, Mr Kim said he lived in Fairfax, Virginia. He said he used to run a trading and hotel services company in Rason, a special economic zone near the border zone in north-east North Korea. He told CNN he had left a wife and two daughters behind in China, but had had no contact with them since his detention.

"Orchestral musicians 'living on breadline'Nearly half of the UK's classical musicians don't earn enough to live on, says the Musicians' Union.2h2 hours agoEntertainment & Arts","This video can not be played Classical musicians need multiple jobs to survive, says Jemma Freestone Nearly half of the UK's classical musicians don't earn enough to live on, says the Musicians' Union (MU). Although rank-and-file members of the BBC Philharmonic or City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra are paid about Â£30,000 a year, wages have stagnated as funding cuts take hold. Young musicians are particularly affected, with two-fifths of newcomers taking unpaid work in the last year. Forty-four per cent of players told the MU they struggled to make ends meet. And two-thirds of veteran musicians - who'd been playing for more than 30 years - said they'd considered alternative careers. ""Wages are increasingly depressed,"" said Michael Kidd, who plays French horn with the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra. ""If it continues in that direction, it's not going to remain a viable career option."" The 29-year-old, who played at the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, receiving a piece of wedding cake from Prince Charles as a thank you gift, told the BBC that many musicians were also saddled with debt. ""A lot of the string players are basically having to take out a mortgage to buy an instrument on top of a not very good salary,"" he said. The Musicians' Union says there could be a ""cultural void"" if orchestras are forced to close. Flautist Jemma Freestone says she, like many other players, supplements her salary by taking other music-related jobs. ""It's becoming increasingly obvious that playing your instrument is a small part of what is needed to survive in this industry,"" she told the BBC. ""For me, that's a brilliant thing. I love teaching and I love doing workshops but for some other people that can be very difficult. ""All you learn in music college is how to play your instrument. You don't learn these auxiliary skills that, in reality, you need to survive."" Ms Freestone plays with the Southbank Sinfonia and the National Theatre, aside from her teaching and outreach work. But she notes that in other European countries, orchestral musicians ""the salary is far higher"". ""Perhaps it's not valued enough as a profession,"" she said. ""We study for five, six, seven years. It's very competitive, and it's very difficult to get a job as an orchestral musician. And when you get there, you like to think that that's enough. ""I don't think anybody enters music for the money,"" she added, ""but you do have to earn a living"". Mr Kidd said many of his orchestral colleagues lived under the constant threat of unemployment. ""It's reached a point where [we] are having to rely increasingly on generous concert-goers - not just ticket buyers, but the few that are prepared to pay a little bit extra to keep supporting the orchestras,"" he said. ""Obviously we're all very passionate about what we do. But if we're entirely reliant on the goodwill of our audience, you inevitably have the fear of 'Will this survive?'. ""It could all go belly-up."" The Musicians' Union surveyed 285 musicians in seven orchestras across the UK to reach its findings.

Bath oils for child eczema 'ineffective',"Experts said there was a ""good case"" to spend NHS money on other eczema treatments Bath oils used to help treat eczema in children offer no meaningful benefit as part of their care, a trial has found. Emollient bath additives are estimated to make up as much as a third of the cost of treating eczema in the UK. But a newtrial, published in the BMJ,external, found ""no evidence of clinical benefit"" when they were used in addition to other treatments for the condition. Experts said it suggested the Â£23m spent each year by the NHS on the additives could be used better. 'Natural defence' treatment for eczema New approach to eczema treatment closer Eczema is the most common inflammatory skin condition in childhood and often lasts for years. Emollients come in three forms - leave-on emollients, soap substitutes and bath additives - and are often prescribed in combination with each other. Although there was evidence that leave-on emollients and soap substitutes were effective, until now there had been a lack of strong research on how well bath additives worked, authors of this new paper said. For their study they randomly assigned 482 children aged one to 11 from England and Wales into two groups - with one receiving the bath emollient and the other not using it. All of the children continued their normal eczema care routine, including regular use of leave-on emollients and corticosteroid creams, which reduce inflammation and irritation. Symptoms had improved in both groups over the course of 16 weeks, but there had been no statistically significant difference between them, the trial found. There were also no significant differences between the two groups across other measures, including eczema severity over one year, number of eczema flare-ups, quality of life and cost-effectiveness. Dr Miriam Santer, a GP and associate professor at Southampton University in primary care research, who led the study, said: ""We don't need to tell people to put the bath additives in the water anymore. ""That will save trouble for families, knowing how best to treat the eczema and which treatments really help, and will also save the NHS money. ""The bath additives don't work - basically you're pouring stuff down the plughole."" But she added that people should continue to use the leave-on emollients and soap substitutes. Dr Martin Ward Platt, a consultant paediatrician in neonatal at the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle, not involved in the study, said the trial's ""robust"" findings suggested NHS money should be spent on other treatments. He said: ""That doesn't mean they shouldn't be available on sale for people who want to give them a try or use them out of personal preference, but the notion that one should prescribe them and spend public money on them is heavily undermined. ""There's a good case now to not have these on prescription and use the money elsewhere."" Andrew Proctor, from the National Eczema Society, said wider research showed emollients were safe and effective and a ""vital part of day-to-day skin care"" for people living with eczema. ""People tell us that using emollient when bathing can be a help in managing their eczema. ""It's vital that we have better evidence about what works well, so people are able to manage their eczema more effectively. For a condition that affects millions of children and adults, it's concerning that more research hasn't already been done into basic treatment approaches,"" he said. The study said it could not rule out the possibility that bath additives could offer small benefits to children bathing more than five times a week or among children under five. One limitation of the trial was that the bath additive was used with other treatments, so it did not look at how effective it was in isolation. But Dr Ward Platt said it was ""very unlikely"" that it would work well on its own, as if it did it would probably have added to the effect of the other treatments. Follow Alex on Twitter,external.

Dust storms kill dozens in India,"This video can not be played The storms destroyed homes and uprooted trees At least 109 people have been killed and scores more injured in fierce dust storms that hit the northern Indian states of Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan. The storms on Wednesday disrupted electricity, uprooted trees, destroyed houses and killed livestock. Many of the dead were sleeping when their houses collapsed after being struck by intense bursts of lightning. Dust storms are common in this part of India during summer but loss of life on this scale is unusual. At least 73 people died in Uttar Pradesh - more than half of them of them in Agra district, which is home to the Taj Mahal monument. Officials say the death toll could increase further. Taj Mahal minarets damaged in storm The victims of India's poisonous dust The tragic lives of India's mistreated captive elephants Falling trees and walls killed many people in the state. Local journalist Laxmikant Pachouri told the BBC that 21 people had died in the village of Kheragarh, about 50km (30 miles) south-west of Agra. More than 20 people were left dead in Kheragarh village Some of the houses there were made of mud, others from bricks and mortar. ""People are in shock and can't believe that such destruction happened in their village. I met a family which lost four children last night - it was so disturbing. The family can't believe it. They told me that their children were playing in the house when a wall collapsed on them,"" Pachouri said. ""Their parents are so distraught and cannot stop crying."" Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he was saddened by the loss of life. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has directed officials to personally monitor relief operations. This video can not be played Storm risk continues for parts of India The storms also affected three districts in neighbouring Rajasthan state - Alwar, Bharatpur and Dholpur - where at least 36 people were killed. Officials say Alwar is worst affected. Schools in the district are closed. Alwar hotel owner Shivam Lohia said he abandoned his car after it was almost blown off the road. ""I haven't seen such a devastating storm in at least 25 years. Everyone was scared and running for cover as trees and homes were getting blown away. It was a nightmare,"" he told the AFP news agency. The Uttar Pradesh government has also announced that families of the dead will receive 400,000 rupees ($6,000; Â£4,400) as compensation. The southern state of Andhra Pradesh, meanwhile, was hit by more than 41,000 lightning strikes on Wednesday, reported news agency AFP - saying there had also been deaths in that state. Officials said they had been taken aback by the ferocity of the storms. ""I've been in office for 20 years and this is the worst I've seen,"" Hemant Gera, secretary for disaster management and relief in Rajasthan, told the BBC. This man in Agra was one of many carried from the debris of homes ""We had a high intensity dust storm on 11 April - 19 people died then - but this time it struck during the night so many people sleeping and couldn't get out of their houses when mud walls collapsed."" Mr Gera said teams were trying to restore electricity to homes after 200 to 300 electricity poles were felled in the storm. The dust storm also hit the capital Delhi, more than 100km (62 miles) away, late on Wednesday evening. The city was also belted by heavy rain.

'Synthetic' embryos could help fertility,"Two of the embryo-like structures grown by the scientists in the lab Dutch scientists have built ""synthetic"" embryos in their laboratory using mouse cells other than sperm and eggs. The stem cell breakthrough, described inNature journal,external, is not for cloning people or animals, but about understanding why many pregnancies fail at an early stage - implantation. The embryos, made in a dish, attached to the womb lining of live female mice and grew for a few days. Studying the process could help human fertility, experts say. Many miscarriages occur before a woman is even aware she is pregnant, when the fertilised egg does not manage to implant in the womb. Experts do not fully understand why this occurs, although it is likely to be linked to abnormalities in the growing embryo. Studying how early embryos develop is tricky both ethically and technically. Using stem cells, rather than sperm and eggs, to make model embryos could offer a plentiful supply for scientific research. Representation of the synthetic embryo Stem cells are immature cells that can turn into many different types in the body during early life and growth. Dr Nicolas Rivron, from the Merlin Institute of Maastricht University, and his team created the embryo-like structures by mixing two types of stem cells from mice. Under the microscope, they looked identical to real early embryos or blastocysts, with the same spherical ball of cells that would usually go on to make the placenta and baby. The researchers were then able to observe it implant in mice - something that hasn't been done before, althoughother scientists have created stem cell embryos for research. Dr Rivron told the BBC: ""We can now generate extremely large numbers of these embryos and study them in detail. It could help us understand why some embryos fail to implant and let us screen for drugs that might help with fertility."" He said there were no plans yet to repeat the results using human stem cells. That would require approval. Prof Robin Lovell-Badge, an expert at the UK's Francis Crick Institute, said the prospects for obtaining human embryo-like structures in this way was currently ""very remote"". ""This is a pity for basic research because it would be very useful to have a limitless supply of human blastocyst-like stage embryos to understand the relevant cell-cell interactions required to make normal embryos and to study mechanisms of implantation. ""However, it may come as a relief to others that such a method of producing many genetically identical human embryo-like structures that might be capable of implantation is not feasible - even if it would be illegal to implant them into women, as is clearly the situation in the UK."" Dr Harry Leitch, Group Head at the MRC London Institute of Medical Sciences and Honorary Clinical Lecturer at Imperial College London, said it was the most successful attempt so far at building an early embryo from stem cell lines. Dr Dusko Ilic, a stem cell expert at King's College London, said: ""This is the first time that scientists have been able to shed a light on the molecular mechanisms of implantation and these findings may help us to understand more about some aspects of infertility and improve outcomes of assisted reproduction.""

What we know about North Korea's US detainees,"One of the three men who have been reportedly relocated, Kim Dong-chul, was sentenced to 10 years' hard labour after appearing before the media to confess in March 2016 Three Americans detained in North Korea are on their way home after being released in what is likely to be a goodwill gesture ahead of unprecedented talks between the leaders of US and North Korea. US President Donald Trump tweeted: ""I am pleased to inform you that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is in the air and on his way back from North Korea with the 3 wonderful gentlemen that everyone is looking so forward to meeting."" Their release came after a meeting between Mr Pompeo and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. Just asking! Trump floats Korea border idea The tricky task of preparing for the Trump-Kim summit Will we ever know what happened to Otto Warmbier? A White House statement said the three men appeared to be in good health and were able to walk on to their plane unassisted. The only other US prisoner to be released by North Korea under Donald Trump's presidency was university student Otto Warmbier, who returned to the US in a coma and died days later. Two of the newly released detainees were jailed in 2017, after Mr Trump became president. Here is what we know about the three men. Kim Hak-song worked at the Pyongyang University of Science and Technology (PUST)and was held on suspicion of ""hostile acts"" on 6 May 2017. He was reportedly detained while in Pyongyang Station. The university, which mostly teaches the children of North Korea's elite, was founded in 2010 by a Korean-American Christian entrepreneur, with much of the costs funded by US and South Korea Christian charities. Several foreign lecturers are thought to teach there. This video can not be played Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un: From enemies to frenemies Kim Hak-song had previously described himself as a Christian missionary who intended to start an experimental farm at PUST, Reuters news agency reported, citing an online post by Mr Kim. He is, reports say, an ethnic Korean born just across the North Korean border in China who emigrated to the US in the 1990s. He is said to have gone on to study agriculture in Yanbian, a Chinese prefecture which borders North Korea, before moving to Pyongyang. Two weeks before Kim Hak-song was arrested, Kim Sang-duk - also known as Tony Kim -was detained on espionage charges. He was trying to leave the country after spending a month working at PUST. South Korean media said he was 55 and had been involved in humanitarian work in the North. ""Some officials at PUST told me his arrest was not related to his work at PUST,"" the chancellor of the university, Chan-Mo Park, told Reuters news agency. Tony Kim was detained on espionage charges ""He had been involved with some other activities outside PUST, such as helping an orphanage."" Mr Kim studied accounting at two American universities and had worked as an accountant in the US for more than a decade, his Facebook page says. He had also taught in Yanbian. A South Korea-born US citizen, Kim Dong-chul is a pastor in his early 60s. He was detained in 2015 on spying chargesand sentenced to 10 years' hard labour in 2016. Before his trial, he was presented at a government-arranged press conference, where he apparently confessed to stealing military secrets in collusion with South Korea - a claim rejected by Seoul. In an interview with CNN in January 2016,external, Mr Kim said he lived in Fairfax, Virginia. He said he used to run a trading and hotel services company in Rason, a special economic zone near the border zone in north-east North Korea. He told CNN he had left a wife and two daughters behind in China, but had had no contact with them since his detention.

"Do not quit Iran deal, UN urges Trump","This video can not be played UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres tells US not to withdraw from nuclear deal with Iran UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has urged Donald Trump not to walk away from an international deal designed to prevent Iran acquiring nuclear weapons. Speaking to the BBC, Mr Guterres said there was a real risk of war if the 2015 agreement was not preserved. Mr Trump has been a strong critic of the accord, in which Iran agreed to limit its nuclear programme in return for the lifting of sanctions. The US president has until 12 May to decide whether to stick with the deal. Mr Guterres told the BBC that the Iran agreement was an ""important diplomatic victory"" and should be maintained. ""We should not scrap it unless we have a good alternative,"" he said, adding: ""We face dangerous times."" Could the Iran nuclear deal collapse? It comes just days after Israel revealed ""secret nuclear files"" accusing Iran of having covertly pursued nuclear weapons. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the files provided proof that the Obama-era nuclear deal was ""built on lies"". European allies France, the UK and Germany meanwhile have agreed that pursuing the current nuclear deal with Iran is the best way to stop it developing nuclear weapons. In 2015 Tehran signed a deal with the US, China, Russia, Germany, France and Britain agreeing to limit its nuclear activities in return for the lifting of crippling economic sanctions. Under the deal, officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), Iran is committed to slashing the number of its centrifuges, which are machines used to enrich uranium. It is also meant to cut its stockpile of enriched uranium drastically and not enrich remaining uranium to the level needed to produce nuclear weapons. Iran nuclear agreement: Key details The number of centrifuges installed at Iran's Natanz and Fordo sites was cut drastically soon after the deal while tonnes of low-enriched uranium were shipped to Russia. Furthermore, monitors from the IAEA have been able to carry out snap inspections at Iranian nuclear sites. On Monday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu revealed what he said were pages of material that proved Iran had covertly pursued nuclear weapons. Speaking in English from Israel's defence ministry in Tel Aviv, Mr Netanyahu showed off what he said were ""exact copies"" of documents obtained by Israeli intelligence from a secret storage facility in Tehran. This video can not be played In 2018, Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu unveiled what he claimed to be Iran's secret atomic archive There were, he said, 55,000 pages of evidence and a further 55,000 files on 183 CDs relating to a secret nuclear weapons programme, dubbed Project Amad. The project, he said, had had the explicit goal of producing five warheads, each with the yield of 10 kilotonnes of TNT. He said Tehran had continued to pursue what he described as nuclear weapons knowledge after the project was shuttered in 2003. He said this was evidence that Iran had lied about its nuclear ambitions before the deal was signed in 2015. Tension between the long-standing enemies has grown steadily since Iran built up its military presence in Syria, which lies to the north-east of Israel. Mr Trump has frequently voiced his opposition to the ""insane"" deal, which he has described as the ""worst ever"". He has warned that the US would withdraw completely on 12 May - the next deadline for waiving sanctions - unless European signatories to the deal and Congress addressed his concerns. This video can not be played A timeline of what Trump's said about the Iran deal He is unhappy that the deal only limited Iran's nuclear activities for a fixed period and had failed to stop the development of ballistic missiles. He also said it had handed Iran a $100bn (Â£72bn) windfall that it used ""as a slush fund for weapons, terror, and oppression"" across the Middle East. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has questioned the legitimacy of efforts by the US and France to change the nuclear deal with his country. Mr Rouhani has said that Mr Trump has no ""right"" to renegotiate the seven-party agreement. How sanctions have hit ordinary Iranians He has said Iran ""will not accept any restrictions beyond its commitments"" to comply with international rules in the years ahead. Mr Rouhani has also accused Mr Trump of ""maliciously violating"" the nuclear agreement. Iran maintains that the missiles it has tested are not designed to carry nuclear warheads and insists its nuclear programme is a peaceful one for energy purposes.

Doctors 'warned' of killer's knife hoard,"Alexander Palmer was jailed for a minimum of 28 years in March The parents of a mentally ill ex-soldier warned a health trust he was collecting knives before he murdered an 83-year-old dog walker. Alexander Palmer, 24, stabbed Peter Wrighton 45 times in woodland near East Harling, Norfolk, in August. A letter from a Norfolk and Suffolk NHS Foundation Trust psychiatrist said Palmer was told to ""get rid"" of the weapons and would ""hopefully"" comply. The trust said an internal review into the case was under way. Palmer was described as ""dangerous"" when he was sentenced to life in prison for murdering Mr Wrighton, whose injuries were so severe police initially thought he had been killed by an animal. Palmer's parents said their warnings that their son was not taking his medication were ignored because health workers said they could only ""believe the patient"". His mother and stepfather - who do not want to be named - told BBC Look East he had been documented as saying it was ""inevitable"" he would kill. Peter Wrighton was walking his dogs alone when he was set upon from behind by Palmer The parents said they also told mental health professionals Palmer had knives and added the ""severity"" of his illness was not appreciated. ""Alex was purchasing knives. Once he knew I knew that he'd got them, he became more secretive,"" his mother said. In January 2017, Palmer, who lived in Cringleford near Norwich, told his GP he was experiencing more voices telling him to hurt people and had bought a hunting knife and a machete. Palmer, 24, subsequently visited a specialist at the Norfolk and Suffolk NHS Foundation Trust, who wrote to the GP. ""It is in his best interests to get rid of such weapons. Alex is aware of this and understands this and hopefully will act accordingly,"" the specialist wrote. The letter goes on to say that Palmer did not feel driven to act on his violent fantasies. This video can not be played Alexander Palmer's parents tell the BBC's Robby West warnings about their son were ignored Palmer had served in an Army commando regiment but was discharged in November 2015 after his head was ""crushed"" in a violent attack, his parents said. They said he returned home a ""different"" person but received multiple diagnoses from a string of professionals. His mother added: ""It says in the letter 'mum was concerned about what Alex was going to do with those knives'. There was no 'this is a mental health patient with a machete'."" His stepfather said: ""They were talking to him like he was a teenager as opposed to a trained soldier."" Dog walker's killer jailed for 28 years 'Voices' told accused to kill dog walker DNA of accused found on killed dog walker His mother said it had been noted in two reports that her son ""said he is going to kill somebody, how he is going to kill somebody and he's said it's inevitable"". ""They thought we were busybodies, interfering in Alex's mental health and care, because they were the experts,"" she added. Correspondence sent by mental health professionals over a two-year period before the murder documented Palmer's violent fantasies and the voices telling him to harm others. After he was sectioned in 2015 in Peterborough, medical notes said he wanted to ""get rid"" of people in the street by ""stringing them up and cutting them open"". Peter Wrighton's body was discovered on the edge of woodland by walkers A psychologist who treated Palmer at RAF Marham contacted police after reading press reports about Mr Wrighton's murder, saying she thought he could be responsible. His mother said Norfolk and Suffolk NHS Foundation Trust had ""missed chances"" to prevent the killing. ""I am not going to blame them solely, maybe we should have done more, but the amount of times we were treated like we were interfering, it didn't matter how desperate I was,"" she said. Palmer's stepfather added: ""Peter Wrighton paid the price and his family continues to do so."" In a statement, Norfolk and Suffolk NHS Foundation Trust said its independently-chaired internal review was due to finish this summer. It said it would ""incorporate information from all involved, including the families, carers and, of course, clinicians, along with any external parties who may have any relevant information"". ""The trust wishes to offer its continued support to the victim's family and to others who have been affected by these tragic violent events,"" it added. ""It would be inappropriate to pre-judge the findings of any review or to comment any further at this point."" His parents said their concerns about medical treatment for their son were continuing. Before Palmer was convicted, he was held at Rampton Secure Hospital but he is now serving his sentence in the general prison population at Wakefield jail, West Yorkshire. His mother said within two weeks he had carved the word 'help' into his arm and lost two stones. She believed he needed to be transferred to a psychiatric hospital. ""We are aware Alex has committed a horrendous crime... but we both believe he was let down... even now he is not getting any support in prison,""she told the BBC's Today programme. ""He still is an ill person."" The Ministry of Justice said it would not comment on individual cases.

Breast cancer widower's IT error shock,"This video can not be played Patricia Minchin says her cancer may have been spotted earlier had she received a screening letter A breast cancer survivor and a man whose wife died from the disease have reacted angrily to revelations that an NHS computer error led to 450,000 people missing screening tests. Patricia Minchin said her ""traumatic journey"" could have been ""avoided"". Brian Gough, whose wife Trixie died in 2015, said she might have survived if her cancer had been diagnosed earlier. A think tank has questioned why the error, for whichthe health secretary has apologised, was not spotted sooner. Women aged between 50 and 70 are supposed to be invited for a mammogram every three years. But about 450,000 women in England aged 68-71 failed to get invitations since 2009 because of a computer error, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt told the Commons. He said the mistake could have shortened the lives of up to 270 women. Breast screening: What went wrong? Breast scan error 'shortened up to 270 lives' Breast screening: For and against Why isn't breast cancer screening totally reliable? Ms Minchin, a former nurse, told the BBC she believed she was one of those who should have got an invitation for a screening, but didn't. She was tested in 2009 when she was 67 but was not called back for a second examination. In 2015 she discovered three lumps in her breast, two of which ""were deep"" and ""had obviously been growing for some time"". Mrs Minchin underwent chemotherapy and radiotherapy in what she called a ""traumatic journey"". She said: ""You can never say it could have been prevented but I really think if I had had a mammogram when I was 70, (the cancer) may have been picked up."" Brian and Trixie Gough had been married for 56 years Brian Gough, 77, said he was shocked by Mr Hunt's revelation. His wife Trixie was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2010, a year after she should have had a scan. The cancer was treated but returned and his wife died three days after Christmas 2015 aged 76. Mr Gough, from Norfolk, said: ""She didn't know anything about it until a year too late."" Call the breast screening helpline number 0800 169 2692 Go theNHS Choices website,externalfor more information You should receive a letter by the end of May He said ""maybe just maybe"" Mrs Gough - to whom he had been married to for 56 years - would have survived if treatment for the first cancer had started earlier. The widower said: ""I can't express how sad it is. ""I know we can't be certain it would have picked up her cancer as it may not have developed or that she would have survived, but it is possible."" Early diagnosis is ""absolutely essential"" according to Baroness Delyth Morgan, chief executive of Breast Cancer Now. She said: ""I feel extremely sad for the women affected by this colossal administrative disaster. ""It's hugely significant, we have to be concerned about confidence in the screening service."" Baroness Morgan said the revelation was ""hugely significant"" Meanwhile, the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) has questioned why a fall in the number of women getting screened did not raise any alarms. In a recent report on the NHS, the IPPR said the number of women who accepted invitations had fallen to 71%, a 10 year low. The IPPR said health chiefs should have examined the data earlier to find out what was happening. An independent review set up by ministers will try to establish who was responsible and whether problems should have been flagged up sooner. All women affected will now be contacted by letter by the end of May and those under 72 will receive an appointment for a catch-up mammogram. Women aged over 72 can contact a helpline to talk through the pros and cons of having breast screening. Scans in older women sometimes pick up cancers which do not require treatment.

"Orchestral musicians 'living on breadline'Nearly half of the UK's classical musicians don't earn enough to live on, says the Musicians' Union.5h5 hours agoEntertainment & Arts","This video can not be played Classical musicians need multiple jobs to survive, says Jemma Freestone Nearly half of the UK's classical musicians don't earn enough to live on, says the Musicians' Union (MU). Although rank-and-file members of the BBC Philharmonic or City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra are paid about Â£30,000 a year, wages have stagnated as funding cuts take hold. Young musicians are particularly affected, with two-fifths of newcomers taking unpaid work in the last year. Forty-four per cent of players told the MU they struggled to make ends meet. And two-thirds of veteran musicians - who'd been playing for more than 30 years - said they'd considered alternative careers. ""Wages are increasingly depressed,"" said Michael Kidd, who plays French horn with the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra. ""If it continues in that direction, it's not going to remain a viable career option."" The 29-year-old, who played at the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, receiving a piece of wedding cake from Prince Charles as a thank you gift, told the BBC that many musicians were also saddled with debt. ""A lot of the string players are basically having to take out a mortgage to buy an instrument on top of a not very good salary,"" he said. The Musicians' Union says there could be a ""cultural void"" if orchestras are forced to close. Flautist Jemma Freestone says she, like many other players, supplements her salary by taking other music-related jobs. ""It's becoming increasingly obvious that playing your instrument is a small part of what is needed to survive in this industry,"" she told the BBC. ""For me, that's a brilliant thing. I love teaching and I love doing workshops but for some other people that can be very difficult. ""All you learn in music college is how to play your instrument. You don't learn these auxiliary skills that, in reality, you need to survive."" Ms Freestone plays with the Southbank Sinfonia and the National Theatre, aside from her teaching and outreach work. But she notes that in other European countries, orchestral musicians ""the salary is far higher"". ""Perhaps it's not valued enough as a profession,"" she said. ""We study for five, six, seven years. It's very competitive, and it's very difficult to get a job as an orchestral musician. And when you get there, you like to think that that's enough. ""I don't think anybody enters music for the money,"" she added, ""but you do have to earn a living"". Mr Kidd said many of his orchestral colleagues lived under the constant threat of unemployment. ""It's reached a point where [we] are having to rely increasingly on generous concert-goers - not just ticket buyers, but the few that are prepared to pay a little bit extra to keep supporting the orchestras,"" he said. ""Obviously we're all very passionate about what we do. But if we're entirely reliant on the goodwill of our audience, you inevitably have the fear of 'Will this survive?'. ""It could all go belly-up."" The Musicians' Union surveyed 285 musicians in seven orchestras across the UK to reach its findings. To highlight their predicament, the organisation is launching a campaign, Musician Behind the Moment, to remind people of how valuable orchestras can be - in the hope fans will put pressure on the Arts Council and local councils to increase funding. ""Even if you're not a classic music fan, you probably interact with orchestras more than you realise,"" said Naomi Pohl, the MU's assistant general secretary. ""So if you're watching your favourite TV programme or film, or playing your favourite video game - orchestral musicians are on those soundtracks. ""Also our members do a lot of work in dementia homes and hospitals now, as well as in education settings, like teaching a child a musical instrument for the first time. ""We know there's not an unlimited pot of money but we're trying to make the point that orchestras are really valuable resources in communities. We want to see a bit of an increased priority for orchestras."" ""The worst case scenario is we'll see a lot of orchestras closing,"" she added. ""It would be disastrous.""

Trump 'repaid lawyer's Stormy hush money',"Mr Trump has previously said he knew nothing of the payment to Ms Daniels President Donald Trump personally repaid his lawyer the $130,000 that was used to buy an adult film actor's silence about an alleged affair, his legal aide Rudy Giuliani has said. It appears to contradict Mr Trump, who said he did not know about the payment made by lawyer Michael Cohen to Stormy Daniels ahead of the 2016 election. Mr Trump has denied Ms Daniels' claims of an affair in 2006. Mr Giuliani said no campaign finance was used, a key issue in the matter. Should Trump be worried about Stormy Daniels? The president and the porn star: Why this matters What are non-disclosure agreements? The former New York City mayor recently joined Mr Trump's legal team and was talking to Sean Hannity on Fox News. The campaign finance issue appeared to be one his main motives for appearing on the programme - to deny that there was any wrongdoing. Allow Twitter content?

Mr Cohen's $130,000 (Â£95,650) payment to Ms Daniels just before the 2016 election could count as an illegal contribution to President Trump's campaign. Mr Giuliani said: ""That money was not campaign money. Sorry, I'm giving you a fact now that you don't know. It's not campaign money. No campaign finance violation. ""They funnelled it through a law firm and the president repaid it."" He added that the president ""didn't know about the specifics of it, as far as I know, but he did know about the general arrangement that Michael would take care of things like this"". Mr Giulianilater spoke to the New York Times,external, saying: ""Some time after the campaign is over, they set up a reimbursement, $35,000 a month, out of his personal family account."" The sum paid was $460,000-$470,000, including expenses, he said. He also said Mr Trump was aware of what he was going to say on Fox News and that he had spoken to the president before and after the interview. US federal law restricts how much individuals and organisations can contribute to campaign financing and there are also strict regulations on the disclosure of the financing. The first question is whether the payment to Ms Daniels was campaign related.Legal expert Lawrence Noble told the Washington Post,external: ""If the purpose of this was to stop [Daniels] from hurting the campaign, then what you have is Cohen made a loan to the campaign."" The $130,000 would exceed the amount an individual can donate to a presidential campaign. Michael Cohen is facing a criminal investigation over the matter Any repayment by the Trump campaign would violate the law. But presidential candidates are allowed to contribute an unlimited amount to their own campaign. Mr Trump may be arguing, through Mr Giuliani, that the personal nature of the repayment makes it legal. However, if the $130,000 is deemed to have been a loan, the president could face questions as to why his personal financial disclosure form from June 2017 made no mention of any debt to Mr Cohen. The repayment would have had to be disclosed to the Federal Election Commission if it were an election-related expense. A wilful violation could be a crime. Ms Daniels' lawyer said it would need to be determined whether the payment was hidden in such a way as to violate anti-money laundering statutes. When asked by reporters a month ago if he knew about the payment to Ms Daniels, Mr Trump said: ""No."" When asked why the payment was given to Ms Daniels, he added: ""You'll have to ask Michael Cohen."" The president might argue that the lawyer ""took care of things like this"", as Mr Giuliani suggested and that he knew nothing of the ""specifics"", making the repayment personally later. Mr Giuliani told the Times he did not know whether Mr Trump was aware of the payment to Ms Daniels at the time but his understanding was that the president had only learned about it recently. It is unclear how this fits with his statement that repayments were made over several months. Speaking on Fox TV last week, Mr Trump suggested some knowledge of the matter in admitting Mr Cohen had represented him during the ""crazy Stormy Daniels deal"", but did not go into specifics. Mr Cohen, for his part,told the New York Times in February,external: ""Neither the Trump Organization nor the Trump campaign was a party to the transaction with Ms Clifford, and neither reimbursed me for the payment, either directly or indirectly."" How this relates to any personal repayments by Mr Trump is unclear. Ms Daniels' lawyer, Michael Avenatti, said that Americans ""should be outraged"" at Mr Giuliani's comments. ""We predicted months ago that it would be proven that the American people had been lied to as to the $130k payment and what Mr Trump knew,"" he wrote on Twitter. He told Associated Press: ""Mr Trump evidently has participated in a felony and there must be serious consequences for his conduct and his lies and deception to the American people."" Analysis by BBC's Anthony Zurcher in Washington There are two ways to look at Rudy Giuliani's blockbuster revelation. The first is that the former New York mayor was freelancing and caught the president and the White House communications team flatfooted. In that case, Mr Giuliani's brief return to the political spotlight will be short-lived. The other possibility is that this was a pre-planned revelation in the friendly confines of Sean Hannity's Fox News talk show. Some in the White House may have been caught by surprise, but there was a strategy in play. Perhaps Mr Giuliani and the president decided that the legal exposure from hiding that Mr Trump made the payment was more dangerous than the political risk from admitting he cut the cheque and lied about it. Mr Trump has proven bulletproof when it comes to most political scandals and this one may prove no different, although the Stormy saga has proven to have staying power. Even with the revelation, the president and Mr Cohen's payment may still constitute a campaign finance law violation. The Stormy clouds aren't going away. The payment relates to allegations by Ms Daniels that she had sex with Mr Trump in 2006, allegations he denies. After initially denying the payment, Mr Cohen eventually admitted he had paid the sum privately to Ms Daniels, real name Stephanie Clifford, in October 2016 out of his own funds in exchange for her silence in a non-disclosure agreement. This video can not be played Stormy Daniels: ""I was threatened"" He denied that Mr Trump was a party to the transaction. Mr Cohen is now facing a criminal investigation. FBI agents searched his home and office in New York recently in relation to the nondisclosure agreement. In March this year, Ms Daniels filed a lawsuit against the president, alleging that the agreement was invalid because Mr Trump did not sign it. She later lost a court motion for Mr Trump to give sworn testimony about her claim that they had a relationship. While Mr Trump has denied her claims, his lawyers are seeking $20m in damages from Ms Daniels, arguing she broke the non-disclosure deal. Ms Daniels is also suing the president over a ""defamatory"" tweet he posted after she said she was threatened by a man in a Las Vegas car park to drop her allegations of the affair. Mr Trump said her claims were ""a total con job"". Trump sued for 'defamatory' tweet Should Trump be worried about Stormy Daniels?

Why Trump and Stormy saga matters,"President Donald Trump denies the allegations made by Stormy Daniels Adult film star Stormy Daniels is suing President Donald Trump over a so-called ""hush agreement"". Ms Daniels (her real name is Stephanie Clifford) alleges she and Mr Trump had sex in 2006, and that he has been trying to keep it quiet ever since. A lawyer for Ms Daniels has made claims of a cover-up, and others have raised questions about potentially illegal campaign payments. The president rejects all the allegations, and lawyers are suing Ms Daniels back for breaking this deal. Mr Trump denies that any money from his 2016 presidential campaign was used to buy Ms Daniels' silence,and says that the affair never happened. Using campaign funds could have been a violation of federal law. But while Mr Trump's supporters have largely ignored the story, along withallegations of sexual assaultandthe infamous Access Hollywood tape, the Stormy Daniels case could see the president testify in court - with 2018 mid-term elections just around the corner. She was born in Louisiana in 1979. She moved into the adult film industry first as a performer, before in 2004 branching out into directing and also writing. Her stage name comes from MÃ¶tley CrÃ¼e's bassist Nikki Sixx's daughter Storm, and the US whisky Jack Daniels - which southerner Ms Clifford chose after reading an ad calling the drink ""a Southern favourite"". You may also recognise her cameo appearances in films The 40-Year-Old Virgin and Knocked Up, and the music video for Maroon Five's song Wake Up Call. She also thought of running for a US Senate seat in Louisiana in 2010 but called off her run after she said her candidacy was not being taken seriously. Stormy Daniels, real name Stephanie Clifford, claims she met Donald Trump in 2006 It all goes back to July 2006 - when the White House was merely a twinkle in Donald Trump's eye. Ms Daniels says she met him that month at a charity golf tournament in Lake Tahoe, a resort area between California and Nevada. In a2011 interview with In Touch Weekly,external, published in full in January, she says Mr Trump invited her to dinner and that she went to meet him in his hotel room. ""He was all sprawled out on the couch, watching television or something,"" she said in the interview. ""He was wearing pyjama pants."" Donald Trump, Melania Trump and Barron Trump in January 2007 Ms Daniels alleges the pair had sex in the hotel room, something Mr Trump's lawyer said his client ""vehemently denies"". If Ms Daniels' account is true, this would all have happened just four months after the birth of Mr Trump's youngest child, Barron. This video can not be played Stormy Daniels: 'I was threatened' In a 60 Minutes interview that aired in late March, Ms Daniels claimed she was threatened to stay quiet about the affair. She alleged a man approached her in a Las Vegas car park in 2011, shortly after she agreed to the In Touch Weekly interview, and told her to ""leave Trump alone"". Ms Daniels said the last time they spoke was in 2010, around the time she called off her US Senate bid. Porn star 'threatened over Trump affair' Rumours of the affair started to appear before the November 2016 presidential election. In January,the Wall Street Journal published an article,externalclaiming President Trump's lawyer, Michael Cohen, made a $130,000 (Â£94,000) payment to Ms Daniels in October 2016, one month before the election. The Journal said the money was part of a non-disclosure agreement with Ms Clifford, which said she couldn't discuss the affair publicly. ""These are old, recycled reports, which were published and strongly denied prior to the election,"" a White House official said. Michael Cohen reportedly set up a corporation that made a $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels in October 2016 Mr Cohen denied the payment. In a statement to the Journal, he called the allegations ""outlandish"", and said they'd been ""consistently denied by all parties"" for years. But in February he announced he had in fact paid Ms Daniels the money. In a statement to the New York Times,external, Mr Cohen said neither the Trump campaign nor the Trump organisation knew anything about the payment, which he had made from his own pocket. ""The payment to Ms Daniels was lawful, and was not a campaign contribution or a campaign expenditure by anyone."" On 3 May,President Trump admitted that Mr Cohen had paid off Ms Danielsand was reimbursed. Earlier, his legal aide Rudy Giuliani had said in a TV interview that the money was Mr Trump's personal cash. Meanwhile, Michael Avenatti, Ms Daniels' lawyer, has claimed that the non-disclosure deal Ms Daniels signed was delivered to Mr Cohen at his Trump Tower office. ""This idea that there's a separation now between Mr Cohen, individually, and the Trump Organization or Mr Cohen, individually, and Donald Trump, it's nonsense,"" he told 60 Minutes. Who said what about Stormy Daniels saga Porn star 'free to discuss' Trump story The porn star scandal Trump can't shake The 60 Minutes interview was highly anticipated, withthe New York Times writing about viewing parties across the US,externaland ""Dark and Stormy"" cocktails on offer in bars. Shortly after it aired, lawyers for Mr Cohen filed a cease-and-desist against Ms Daniels and her lawyer, saying the allegations of a threat defamed Mr Cohen. ""Mr Cohen had absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with any such person or incident, and does not even believe that any such person exists, or that such incident ever occurred,"" the letter reads. Before the 60 Minutes episode,President Trump's lawyers sued Ms Daniels for $20mand to keep the case out of the public eye. The lawyers claim she broke their non-disclosure deal, or ""hush agreement"". This followsMs Daniels saying she was suing Mr Trump, claiming he didn't even sign the ""hush agreement"". Her lawyer, Michael Avenatti, tweeted about the lawsuit with a link to the documents filed in a California court. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

There were also reports thatPresident Trump had won a restraining order against Ms Danielsin February. In April,the FBI raided the New York offices of Mr Cohenfollowing a referral from Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating suspected Russian meddling in the 2016 election. US media reported that documents relating to the payment to Ms Daniels were seized in the raid. But the payment was only one of several topics being investigated, according to the New York Times. Mr Cohen's $130,000 payment to Ms Daniels just before the 2016 election could count as an illegal contribution to President Trump's campaign. Trevor Potter, president of the Campaign Legal Center, said if Mr Cohen did this on Mr Trump's behalf, ""that is a co-ordinated, illegal, in-kind contribution by Cohen for the purpose of influencing the election"". Democrats Ted Lieu and Kathleen Rice, representatives for California and New York respectively, have asked the FBI to investigate Mr Cohen's payment to Ms Daniels. Allow Twitter content?

More importantly, the fact there was a payment made at all by Mr Cohen has not been fully explained. Asked whether the affair is important, Ms Daniels' lawyers said: ""This is about the cover-up. ""This is about the extent that Mr Cohen and the president have gone to intimidate this woman, to silence her, to threaten her, and to put her under their thumb,"" said Mr Avenatti. One of the few Republicans to comment, South Carolina congressman Mark Sanford, told the Washington Post the claims were ""deeply troubling"". ""If it was a Democratic president and hush money had been paid in the campaign, would there be a series of hearings going on?"" Mr Sanford asked. ""I think you could probably point to a fair number of indicators that suggest there would be."" President Trump's supporters,even those on the religious right, have largely brushed off his past behaviour and women's accusations against him. But the growing scandal could have a bearing on the midterm elections, with Democrats already making gains in traditionally Republican areas, to the concern of the party. And the Stormy Daniels scandal could see President Trump called in to testify in court - bringing even greater exposure to the case.

Scientists build 'synthetic embryos',"Two of the embryo-like structures grown by the scientists in the lab Dutch scientists have built ""synthetic"" embryos in their laboratory using mouse cells other than sperm and eggs. The stem cell breakthrough, described inNature journal,external, is not for cloning people or animals, but about understanding why many pregnancies fail at an early stage - implantation. The embryos, made in a dish, attached to the womb lining of live female mice and grew for a few days. Studying the process could help human fertility, experts say. Many miscarriages occur before a woman is even aware she is pregnant, when the fertilised egg does not manage to implant in the womb. Experts do not fully understand why this occurs, although it is likely to be linked to abnormalities in the growing embryo. Studying how early embryos develop is tricky both ethically and technically. Using stem cells, rather than sperm and eggs, to make model embryos could offer a plentiful supply for scientific research. Representation of the synthetic embryo Stem cells are immature cells that can turn into many different types in the body during early life and growth. Dr Nicolas Rivron, from the Merlin Institute of Maastricht University, and his team created the embryo-like structures by mixing two types of stem cells from mice. Under the microscope, they looked identical to real early embryos or blastocysts, with the same spherical ball of cells that would usually go on to make the placenta and baby. The researchers were then able to observe it implant in mice - something that hasn't been done before, althoughother scientists have created stem cell embryos for research. Dr Rivron told the BBC: ""We can now generate extremely large numbers of these embryos and study them in detail. It could help us understand why some embryos fail to implant and let us screen for drugs that might help with fertility."" He said there were no plans yet to repeat the results using human stem cells. That would require approval. Prof Robin Lovell-Badge, an expert at the UK's Francis Crick Institute, said the prospects for obtaining human embryo-like structures in this way was currently ""very remote"". ""This is a pity for basic research because it would be very useful to have a limitless supply of human blastocyst-like stage embryos to understand the relevant cell-cell interactions required to make normal embryos and to study mechanisms of implantation. ""However, it may come as a relief to others that such a method of producing many genetically identical human embryo-like structures that might be capable of implantation is not feasible - even if it would be illegal to implant them into women, as is clearly the situation in the UK."" Dr Harry Leitch, Group Head at the MRC London Institute of Medical Sciences and Honorary Clinical Lecturer at Imperial College London, said it was the most successful attempt so far at building an early embryo from stem cell lines. Dr Dusko Ilic, a stem cell expert at King's College London, said: ""This is the first time that scientists have been able to shed a light on the molecular mechanisms of implantation and these findings may help us to understand more about some aspects of infertility and improve outcomes of assisted reproduction.""

"Do not quit Iran deal, UN urges TrumpUN Secretary General Antonio Guterres warns of the risk of war if the nuclear accord is not preserved.1han hour agoUS & Canada","This video can not be played UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres tells US not to withdraw from nuclear deal with Iran UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has urged Donald Trump not to walk away from an international deal designed to prevent Iran acquiring nuclear weapons. Speaking to the BBC, Mr Guterres said there was a real risk of war if the 2015 agreement was not preserved. Mr Trump has been a strong critic of the accord, in which Iran agreed to limit its nuclear programme in return for the lifting of sanctions. The US president has until 12 May to decide whether to stick with the deal. Mr Guterres told the BBC that the Iran agreement was an ""important diplomatic victory"" and should be maintained. ""We should not scrap it unless we have a good alternative,"" he said, adding: ""We face dangerous times."" Could the Iran nuclear deal collapse? It comes just days after Israel revealed ""secret nuclear files"" accusing Iran of having covertly pursued nuclear weapons. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the files provided proof that the Obama-era nuclear deal was ""built on lies"". European allies France, the UK and Germany meanwhile have agreed that pursuing the current nuclear deal with Iran is the best way to stop it developing nuclear weapons. In 2015 Tehran signed a deal with the US, China, Russia, Germany, France and Britain agreeing to limit its nuclear activities in return for the lifting of crippling economic sanctions. Under the deal, officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), Iran is committed to slashing the number of its centrifuges, which are machines used to enrich uranium. It is also meant to cut its stockpile of enriched uranium drastically and not enrich remaining uranium to the level needed to produce nuclear weapons. Iran nuclear agreement: Key details The number of centrifuges installed at Iran's Natanz and Fordo sites was cut drastically soon after the deal while tonnes of low-enriched uranium were shipped to Russia. Furthermore, monitors from the IAEA have been able to carry out snap inspections at Iranian nuclear sites. On Monday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu revealed what he said were pages of material that proved Iran had covertly pursued nuclear weapons. Speaking in English from Israel's defence ministry in Tel Aviv, Mr Netanyahu showed off what he said were ""exact copies"" of documents obtained by Israeli intelligence from a secret storage facility in Tehran. This video can not be played In 2018, Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu unveiled what he claimed to be Iran's secret atomic archive There were, he said, 55,000 pages of evidence and a further 55,000 files on 183 CDs relating to a secret nuclear weapons programme, dubbed Project Amad. The project, he said, had had the explicit goal of producing five warheads, each with the yield of 10 kilotonnes of TNT. He said Tehran had continued to pursue what he described as nuclear weapons knowledge after the project was shuttered in 2003. He said this was evidence that Iran had lied about its nuclear ambitions before the deal was signed in 2015. Tension between the long-standing enemies has grown steadily since Iran built up its military presence in Syria, which lies to the north-east of Israel. Mr Trump has frequently voiced his opposition to the ""insane"" deal, which he has described as the ""worst ever"". He has warned that the US would withdraw completely on 12 May - the next deadline for waiving sanctions - unless European signatories to the deal and Congress addressed his concerns. This video can not be played A timeline of what Trump's said about the Iran deal He is unhappy that the deal only limited Iran's nuclear activities for a fixed period and had failed to stop the development of ballistic missiles. He also said it had handed Iran a $100bn (Â£72bn) windfall that it used ""as a slush fund for weapons, terror, and oppression"" across the Middle East. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has questioned the legitimacy of efforts by the US and France to change the nuclear deal with his country. Mr Rouhani has said that Mr Trump has no ""right"" to renegotiate the seven-party agreement. How sanctions have hit ordinary Iranians He has said Iran ""will not accept any restrictions beyond its commitments"" to comply with international rules in the years ahead. Mr Rouhani has also accused Mr Trump of ""maliciously violating"" the nuclear agreement. Iran maintains that the missiles it has tested are not designed to carry nuclear warheads and insists its nuclear programme is a peaceful one for energy purposes.

Cambridge Analytica is shutting down,"Cambridge Analytica's name has already been taken down from the wall of the London office it occupied Cambridge Analytica, the political consultancy at the centre of the Facebook data-sharing scandal, is shutting down. The firm was accused of improperly obtaining personal information on behalf of political clients. According to Facebook, data about up to 87 million of its members was harvested by a quiz app and then passed on to the political consultancy. The social network said its own probe into the matter would continue. ""This doesn't change our commitment and determination to understand exactly what happened and make sure it doesn't happen again,"" said a spokesman. ""We are continuing with our investigation in cooperation with the relevant authorities."" The company has been accused of using the personal data of millions of Facebook users to sway the outcome of the US 2016 presidential election and the UK Brexit referendum. Cambridge Analytica: The story so far The global reach of Cambridge Analytica In March, Channel 4 aired undercover footage of Cambridge Analytica's CEO, Alexander Nix, giving examples of how the firm could swing elections around the world with underhand tactics such as smear campaigns and honey traps. The UK-based company, which denies any wrongdoing, has an extensive record of working abroad on many election campaigns, including in Italy, Kenya and Nigeria. Clarence Mitchell, a spokesman for Cambridge Analytica, referred the BBC to astatement on the firm's website,external. ""Over the past several months, Cambridge Analytica has been the subject of numerous unfounded accusations and, despite the company's efforts to correct the record, has been vilified for activities that are not only legal, but also widely accepted as a standard component of online advertising in both the political and commercial arenas,"" it said. ""Despite Cambridge Analytica's unwavering confidence that its employees have acted ethically and lawfully... the siege of media coverage has driven away virtually all of the company's customers and suppliers. ""As a result, it has been determined that it is no longer viable to continue operating the business."" Zuckerberg faces formal summons from MPs Was Facebook data's value 'literally nothing'? 'Facebook in PR crisis mode'' The statement added that its parent company SCL Elections was also commencing bankruptcy proceedings. Cambridge Analytica's chief executive Alexander Nix was suspended two months ago By the BBC's technology correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones, in California When the news of Cambridge Analytica's demise broke here at Facebook's F8 developer conference, it is safe to say few tears were shed. The scandal over data misuse has been a crisis not just for Facebook but for the thousands of external developers whose access to data has been curbed in response to the affair. But if they were tempted to celebrate there was a sting in the tail in the political consultancy's statement. It claimed that what it did was not only legal but was standard practice in the world of online advertising. That rang true to some people in this world and there may be more evidence of such practices as Facebook continues its audit of apps. Cambridge Analytica may be gone but as more stones are lifted there may be more unpleasant surprises to come about the use and misuse of personal data. The UK's Financial Times newspaper says it has spoken to another ex-employee of Cambridge Analytica, on condition of anonymity, who said they were sure the company would emerge ""in some other incarnation or guise"". The Observer journalist whose investigation first exposed the data privacy scandal,externalhas suggested that the public remain sceptical. Allow Twitter content?

Cambridge Analytica's chief executive Alexander Nix was suspended in March after the Channel 4 News footage was aired. Last month,Cambridge Analytica said it had only licensed 30 million records,externalbelonging to US citizens from the quiz app's creator Dr Aleksandr Kogan, and that they had not been used in the US presidential election. The firm added that it had since deleted all the information despite claims to the contrary by others. Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg has said the privacy scandal was a ""breach of trust"" One of Cambridge Analytica's major investors is the US hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer. He is said to have put $15m (Â£11m) into the business, according to the Guardian. Mr Mercer, a former computer scientist, is also a major donor to the US Republican Party and helped support Donald Trump's election campaign. He has never given an interview about his political views and is not thought to have commented publicly about the data-harvesting scandal. Earlier on Wednesday, a cyber-security specialist presented evidence to the UK parliament's Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee.

"Orchestral musicians 'living on breadline'Nearly half of the UK's classical musicians don't earn enough to live on, says the Musicians' Union.","This video can not be played Classical musicians need multiple jobs to survive, says Jemma Freestone Nearly half of the UK's classical musicians don't earn enough to live on, says the Musicians' Union (MU). Although rank-and-file members of the BBC Philharmonic or City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra are paid about Â£30,000 a year, wages have stagnated as funding cuts take hold. Young musicians are particularly affected, with two-fifths of newcomers taking unpaid work in the last year. Forty-four per cent of players told the MU they struggled to make ends meet. And two-thirds of veteran musicians - who'd been playing for more than 30 years - said they'd considered alternative careers. ""Wages are increasingly depressed,"" said Michael Kidd, who plays French horn with the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra. ""If it continues in that direction, it's not going to remain a viable career option."" The 29-year-old, who played at the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, receiving a piece of wedding cake from Prince Charles as a thank you gift, told the BBC that many musicians were also saddled with debt. ""A lot of the string players are basically having to take out a mortgage to buy an instrument on top of a not very good salary,"" he said. The Musicians' Union says there could be a ""cultural void"" if orchestras are forced to close. Flautist Jemma Freestone says she, like many other players, supplements her salary by taking other music-related jobs. ""It's becoming increasingly obvious that playing your instrument is a small part of what is needed to survive in this industry,"" she told the BBC. ""For me, that's a brilliant thing. I love teaching and I love doing workshops but for some other people that can be very difficult. ""All you learn in music college is how to play your instrument. You don't learn these auxiliary skills that, in reality, you need to survive."" Ms Freestone plays with the Southbank Sinfonia and the National Theatre, aside from her teaching and outreach work. But she notes that in other European countries, orchestral musicians ""the salary is far higher"". ""Perhaps it's not valued enough as a profession,"" she said. ""We study for five, six, seven years. It's very competitive, and it's very difficult to get a job as an orchestral musician. And when you get there, you like to think that that's enough. ""I don't think anybody enters music for the money,"" she added, ""but you do have to earn a living"". Mr Kidd said many of his orchestral colleagues lived under the constant threat of unemployment. ""It's reached a point where [we] are having to rely increasingly on generous concert-goers - not just ticket buyers, but the few that are prepared to pay a little bit extra to keep supporting the orchestras,"" he said. ""Obviously we're all very passionate about what we do. But if we're entirely reliant on the goodwill of our audience, you inevitably have the fear of 'Will this survive?'. ""It could all go belly-up."" The Musicians' Union surveyed 285 musicians in seven orchestras across the UK to reach its findings. To highlight their predicament, the organisation is launching a campaign, Musician Behind the Moment, to remind people of how valuable orchestras can be - in the hope fans will put pressure on the Arts Council and local councils to increase funding. ""Even if you're not a classic music fan, you probably interact with orchestras more than you realise,"" said Naomi Pohl, the MU's assistant general secretary. ""So if you're watching your favourite TV programme or film, or playing your favourite video game - orchestral musicians are on those soundtracks. ""Also our members do a lot of work in dementia homes and hospitals now, as well as in education settings, like teaching a child a musical instrument for the first time. ""We know there's not an unlimited pot of money but we're trying to make the point that orchestras are really valuable resources in communities. We want to see a bit of an increased priority for orchestras."" ""The worst case scenario is we'll see a lot of orchestras closing,"" she added. ""It would be disastrous.""

"Men arrested at Starbucks settle for $1The two black men will each receive $1 and $200,000 for a youth employment programme.6h6 hours agoUS & Canada","Rashon Nelson (L) and Donte Robinson (R) will each receive $1 and a promise from the city to set up a youth programme Two black men who were arrested at a Starbucks cafe by Philadelphia police last month have reached a financial settlement with the city. Rashon Nelson and Donte Robinson will each receive a symbolic $1 and a promise from officials to set up a programme for young entrepreneurs. The arrest of the men, who had not yet ordered and were waiting for a friend, kicked off a row over racial profiling. Starbucks announced days later it would require employee anti-bias training. This video can not be played Watch the arrest of two black men at Starbucks - and the protests that followed The settlement, which was confirmed to BBC News by a spokesman for Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenny, includes a vow from the city to contribute $200,000 (Â£147,000) to the new programme. The grant money will go towards creating a pilot programme ""for city public high school students with aspirations of becoming entrepreneurs, as envisioned by Robinson and Nelson, who will not receive any money from the grant"", the city announced in a press release. The 12 April arrest led to protests at Starbucks cafes around the country, while other customers shared claims of racial profiling by company staff. The arrest was captured on mobile phone video and showed the men being led away in handcuffs after a manager had accused them of trespassing and causing a disturbance. Starbucks shuts US cafes for race training 'This is an America thing, not Starbucks' Starbucks 'sorry' over black men arrest The two longtime friends, both 23, had just sat down at the coffee chain's downtown location for a meeting to discuss a possible real estate deal. After spending hours in jail, they were released and no charges were filed. The Philadelphia chief of police later apologised for his handling of the arrest. Mayor Kenney said in a statement that he was ""pleased to have resolved the potential claims against the city in this productive manner"". ""This was an incident that evoked a lot of pain in our city,"" he continued. Starbucks race row leaves customers with a bitter aftertaste ""Rather than spending time, money, and resources to engage in a potentially adversarial process, Rashon Nelson and Donte Robinson approached the city and invited us to partner with them in an attempt to make something positive come of this. ""This agreement is the result of those conversations, and I look forward to seeing the fruits of this effort in the coming months and years."" This video can not be played Brandon Wardâs video of his encounter at a Starbucks has gone viral Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson came to Philadelphia to personally apologise to the two men. In a joint statement with Mr Nelson and Mr Robinson,external, Starbucks announced that it had reached a separate financial settlement with the men earlier this week. That confidential settlement ""will allow both sides to move forward and continue to talk and explore means of preventing similar occurrences at any Starbucks locations"", the statement said. Mr Johnson added that he wishes to ""thank Donte and Rashon for their willingness to reconcile"". Mr Nelson and Mr Robinson jointly said they appreciate the effort to foster communication, and add ""we will be measured by our action not words"". As part of the settlement both men have been offered university scholarships by Starbucks, and the opportunity to meet former US Attorney Eric Holder, who has been hired ""as part of the company's long-term diversity and equity efforts"".

Bath oils for child eczema 'ineffective'Experts say the findings suggest the NHS could better spend the Â£23m each year it costs for the treatment.3m4 minutes agoHealth,"Experts said there was a ""good case"" to spend NHS money on other eczema treatments Bath oils used to help treat eczema in children offer no meaningful benefit as part of their care, a trial has found. Emollient bath additives are estimated to make up as much as a third of the cost of treating eczema in the UK. But a newtrial, published in the BMJ,external, found ""no evidence of clinical benefit"" when they were used in addition to other treatments for the condition. Experts said it suggested the Â£23m spent each year by the NHS on the additives could be used better. 'Natural defence' treatment for eczema New approach to eczema treatment closer Eczema is the most common inflammatory skin condition in childhood and often lasts for years. Emollients come in three forms - leave-on emollients, soap substitutes and bath additives - and are often prescribed in combination with each other. Although there was evidence that leave-on emollients and soap substitutes were effective, until now there had been a lack of strong research on how well bath additives worked, authors of this new paper said. For their study they randomly assigned 482 children aged one to 11 from England and Wales into two groups - with one receiving the bath emollient and the other not using it. All of the children continued their normal eczema care routine, including regular use of leave-on emollients and corticosteroid creams, which reduce inflammation and irritation. Symptoms had improved in both groups over the course of 16 weeks, but there had been no statistically significant difference between them, the trial found. There were also no significant differences between the two groups across other measures, including eczema severity over one year, number of eczema flare-ups, quality of life and cost-effectiveness. Dr Miriam Santer, a GP and associate professor at Southampton University in primary care research, who led the study, said: ""We don't need to tell people to put the bath additives in the water anymore. ""That will save trouble for families, knowing how best to treat the eczema and which treatments really help, and will also save the NHS money. ""The bath additives don't work - basically you're pouring stuff down the plughole."" But she added that people should continue to use the leave-on emollients and soap substitutes. Dr Martin Ward Platt, a consultant paediatrician in neonatal at the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle, not involved in the study, said the trial's ""robust"" findings suggested NHS money should be spent on other treatments. He said: ""That doesn't mean they shouldn't be available on sale for people who want to give them a try or use them out of personal preference, but the notion that one should prescribe them and spend public money on them is heavily undermined. ""There's a good case now to not have these on prescription and use the money elsewhere."" Andrew Proctor, from the National Eczema Society, said wider research showed emollients were safe and effective and a ""vital part of day-to-day skin care"" for people living with eczema. ""People tell us that using emollient when bathing can be a help in managing their eczema. ""It's vital that we have better evidence about what works well, so people are able to manage their eczema more effectively. For a condition that affects millions of children and adults, it's concerning that more research hasn't already been done into basic treatment approaches,"" he said. The study said it could not rule out the possibility that bath additives could offer small benefits to children bathing more than five times a week or among children under five. One limitation of the trial was that the bath additive was used with other treatments, so it did not look at how effective it was in isolation. But Dr Ward Platt said it was ""very unlikely"" that it would work well on its own, as if it did it would probably have added to the effect of the other treatments. Follow Alex on Twitter,external.

Scientists build 'synthetic embryos'They were made in a dish from mouse stem cells and resembled an embryo of about three days old.4m4 minutes agoHealth,"Two of the embryo-like structures grown by the scientists in the lab Dutch scientists have built ""synthetic"" embryos in their laboratory using mouse cells other than sperm and eggs. The stem cell breakthrough, described inNature journal,external, is not for cloning people or animals, but about understanding why many pregnancies fail at an early stage - implantation. The embryos, made in a dish, attached to the womb lining of live female mice and grew for a few days. Studying the process could help human fertility, experts say. Many miscarriages occur before a woman is even aware she is pregnant, when the fertilised egg does not manage to implant in the womb. Experts do not fully understand why this occurs, although it is likely to be linked to abnormalities in the growing embryo. Studying how early embryos develop is tricky both ethically and technically. Using stem cells, rather than sperm and eggs, to make model embryos could offer a plentiful supply for scientific research. Representation of the synthetic embryo Stem cells are immature cells that can turn into many different types in the body during early life and growth. Dr Nicolas Rivron, from the Merlin Institute of Maastricht University, and his team created the embryo-like structures by mixing two types of stem cells from mice. Under the microscope, they looked identical to real early embryos or blastocysts, with the same spherical ball of cells that would usually go on to make the placenta and baby. The researchers were then able to observe it implant in mice - something that hasn't been done before, althoughother scientists have created stem cell embryos for research. Dr Rivron told the BBC: ""We can now generate extremely large numbers of these embryos and study them in detail. It could help us understand why some embryos fail to implant and let us screen for drugs that might help with fertility."" He said there were no plans yet to repeat the results using human stem cells. That would require approval. Prof Robin Lovell-Badge, an expert at the UK's Francis Crick Institute, said the prospects for obtaining human embryo-like structures in this way was currently ""very remote"". ""This is a pity for basic research because it would be very useful to have a limitless supply of human blastocyst-like stage embryos to understand the relevant cell-cell interactions required to make normal embryos and to study mechanisms of implantation. ""However, it may come as a relief to others that such a method of producing many genetically identical human embryo-like structures that might be capable of implantation is not feasible - even if it would be illegal to implant them into women, as is clearly the situation in the UK."" Dr Harry Leitch, Group Head at the MRC London Institute of Medical Sciences and Honorary Clinical Lecturer at Imperial College London, said it was the most successful attempt so far at building an early embryo from stem cell lines. Dr Dusko Ilic, a stem cell expert at King's College London, said: ""This is the first time that scientists have been able to shed a light on the molecular mechanisms of implantation and these findings may help us to understand more about some aspects of infertility and improve outcomes of assisted reproduction.""

Tesla optimistic despite new record lossElon Musk's electric car maker lost more than $700m in the first three months of 2018.,"Tesla boss Elon Musk declined to answer a question about orders for the Model 3 car Tesla said it will be profitable in the second half of 2018 - but only if it can make 5,000 Model 3 cars every week. Reaching that goal is in doubt given the electric car maker produced just 2,270 in the last week of April. Tesla is striving to produce more cars as questions mount about its financial situation. The company posted a record quarterly loss of almost $710m (Â£523m) for the three months to March - more than double the same period last year. Revenues jumped 26% to $3.4bn, but it continued to burn through cash. Tesla said it would cut capital spending this year to less than $3bn as it focuses on ""near-term needs"". Elon Musk's firm also told investors that it will deliver more of its expensive luxury models in the second half of the year. Tesla's manufacturing challenges persist, however. It suspended Model 3 production in mid-April in a planned shutdown and expects a total of 10 days of downtime this quarter. Elon Musk: Just walk out of bad meetings SpaceX and Tesla alive 'by skin of their teeth' The company is trying to improve its manufacturing process of the Model 3, its newest car aimed at the mass market. ""We made a mistake by adding too much automation too quickly,"" Tesla told investors on Wednesday. Efraim Levy, an analyst at CFRA, said the results were ""mixed"", noting the decline in the firm's available cash. On a call with financial analysts, the strain over the firm's finances was apparent. Mr Musk refused to answer a question about the number of Model 3 reservations, and cut short an exchange about Tesla's spending plans. ""These questions are so dry. They're killing me,"" he said, moving to take questions from a private shareholder and owner of a finance-focused YouTube channel rather than an institutional analyst. Mr Musk also criticised media coverage of accidents involving driverless cars, saying reports gave a misleading impression about the safety of such vehicles. Tesla shares, which had declined slightly at the start of the call, fell about 5% in after-hours trading in New York. Mr Musk said investors should be focused on the long-term and dismissed concerns about rapid stock movements. ""If people are concerned about volatility, they should definitely not buy our stock,"" he said. Despite its heavy losses the company is worth about $51bn - roughly as much as General Motors, America's biggest car maker. Jamie Albertine, an analyst at Consumer Edge, said in a note: ""Steady, a word not often used in describing Tesla, is becoming more of a reality as management continues to chip away at its 5,000 units per week Model 3 production goal."" He estimated the company would hit that target in the second half of 2018. Is Tesla heading for trouble?

Breast cancer widower's IT error shockA man said his wife might have survived breast cancer if she had been scanned and diagnosed earlier.2m3 minutes agoUK,"This video can not be played Patricia Minchin says her cancer may have been spotted earlier had she received a screening letter A breast cancer survivor and a man whose wife died from the disease have reacted angrily to revelations that an NHS computer error led to 450,000 people missing screening tests. Patricia Minchin said her ""traumatic journey"" could have been ""avoided"". Brian Gough, whose wife Trixie died in 2015, said she might have survived if her cancer had been diagnosed earlier. A think tank has questioned why the error, for whichthe health secretary has apologised, was not spotted sooner. Women aged between 50 and 70 are supposed to be invited for a mammogram every three years. But about 450,000 women in England aged 68-71 failed to get invitations since 2009 because of a computer error, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt told the Commons. He said the mistake could have shortened the lives of up to 270 women. Breast screening: What went wrong? Breast scan error 'shortened up to 270 lives' Breast screening: For and against Why isn't breast cancer screening totally reliable? Ms Minchin, a former nurse, told the BBC she believed she was one of those who should have got an invitation for a screening, but didn't. She was tested in 2009 when she was 67 but was not called back for a second examination. In 2015 she discovered three lumps in her breast, two of which ""were deep"" and ""had obviously been growing for some time"". Mrs Minchin underwent chemotherapy and radiotherapy in what she called a ""traumatic journey"". She said: ""You can never say it could have been prevented but I really think if I had had a mammogram when I was 70, (the cancer) may have been picked up."" Brian and Trixie Gough had been married for 56 years Brian Gough, 77, said he was shocked by Mr Hunt's revelation. His wife Trixie was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2010, a year after she should have had a scan. The cancer was treated but returned and his wife died three days after Christmas 2015 aged 76. Mr Gough, from Norfolk, said: ""She didn't know anything about it until a year too late."" Call the breast screening helpline number 0800 169 2692 Go theNHS Choices website,externalfor more information You should receive a letter by the end of May He said ""maybe just maybe"" Mrs Gough - to whom he had been married to for 56 years - would have survived if treatment for the first cancer had started earlier. The widower said: ""I can't express how sad it is. ""I know we can't be certain it would have picked up her cancer as it may not have developed or that she would have survived, but it is possible."" Early diagnosis is ""absolutely essential"" according to Baroness Delyth Morgan, chief executive of Breast Cancer Now. She said: ""I feel extremely sad for the women affected by this colossal administrative disaster. ""It's hugely significant, we have to be concerned about confidence in the screening service."" Baroness Morgan said the revelation was ""hugely significant"" Meanwhile, the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) has questioned why a fall in the number of women getting screened did not raise any alarms. In a recent report on the NHS, the IPPR said the number of women who accepted invitations had fallen to 71%, a 10 year low. The IPPR said health chiefs should have examined the data earlier to find out what was happening. An independent review set up by ministers will try to establish who was responsible and whether problems should have been flagged up sooner. All women affected will now be contacted by letter by the end of May and those under 72 will receive an appointment for a catch-up mammogram. Women aged over 72 can contact a helpline to talk through the pros and cons of having breast screening. Scans in older women sometimes pick up cancers which do not require treatment.

Breast scan error 'shortened up to 270 lives'Hundreds of women in England may have died prematurely after failing to receive breast scan invitations.11h11 hours agoHealth,"This video can not be played Patricia Minchin says her cancer may have been spotted earlier had she received a screening letter Up to 270 women in England may have died because they did not receive invitations to a final routine breast cancer screening, the Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt says. Speaking in the Commons, he said 450,000 women aged 68-71 had failed to get invitations since 2009. Mr Hunt has announced an independent review and apologised ""wholeheartedly"" to the women and their families. He said oversight of the NHS screening programme had ""not been good enough"". Mr Hunt told the Commons that computer modelling suggested between 135 and 270 women may have had their lives shortened. GPs' leaders said they were ""shocked"" to learn of the error and said the implications for GPs would potentially be ""significant"". Of the 450,000 women affected, 309,000 are still alive and in their 70s. Breast screening: What went wrong? Breast screening: For and against Why isn't breast cancer screening totally reliable? Mr Hunt said: ""For them and others it is incredibly upsetting to know that you did not receive an invitation for screening at the correct time and totally devastating to hear you may have lost or be about to lose a loved one because of administrative incompetence."" He said a computer algorithm failure was to blame, which meant, in some cases, women approaching their 71st birthday were not sent an invitation for a final breast scan as they should have been. Variation in the way that local services sent out invitations may also have been a factor, he said. Breast cancer screening is currently offered once every three years to women aged 50 to 70 in England. All women affected will now be contacted by letter by the end of May and those under 72 will receive an appointment for a catch-up mammogram. Women aged over 72 can contact a helpline to talk through the pros and cons of having breast screening - scans in older women sometimes pick up cancers which do not require treatment. Any woman who wants a mammogram will get one within six months, Mr Hunt said. Call the breast screening helpline number 0800 169 2692 Go theNHS Choices website,externalfor more information You should receive a letter by the end of May The health secretary said it was a priority to make sure additional scans did not cause any delays in the screening programme for other women. Public Health England discovered the problem after analysing data and has apologised to the women affected. Dr Jenny Harries, deputy medical director at PHE, said: ""They and their families' wellbeing is our top priority and we are very sorry for these faults in the system."" Mr Hunt told MPs in the Commons: ""Irrespective of when the incident started, the fact is for many years oversight of our screening programme has not been good enough."" This video can not be played Jeremy Hunt says ""there may be between 135 and 270 women who had their lives shortened"" He apologised ""wholeheartedly and unreservedly"" for the suffering caused. And he added: ""We also need to get to the bottom of precisely how many people were affected, why it happened and most importantly how we can prevent it from ever happening again."" Women in Scotland are not affected by the error because it has a different IT system. Wales and Northern Ireland have similar systems to England but Mr Hunt said there was no reason to believe they were affected. The Royal College of GPs welcomed the independent review and urged women affected not to panic. Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard, chair of the RCGP, said: ""The priority should not be to establish blame, but to put measures in place to invite those women affected for screening, where appropriate; to ensure there are enough resources in the system to cope with any additional demand that might follow as a result; and to take steps to ensure this never happens again."" Emma Greenwood, Cancer Research UK's director of policy and public affairs, said the breast screening error was ""very concerning"". She added: ""It's worth remembering that many breast cancers are still found by women themselves, outside of the screening programme, so if you notice any unusual changes in your breast see your GP straight away."" All women in this age group registered with a GP are invited for screening every three years - around 2.5 million people. This is because the likelihood of getting breast cancer increases with age. After 70, women can still have screening if they choose to by contacting their GP.

Doctors 'warned' of killer's knife hoardAlexander Palmer's parents say they shared their fears before he stabbed an 83-year-old dog walker.1han hour agoNorfolk,"Alexander Palmer was jailed for a minimum of 28 years in March The parents of a mentally ill ex-soldier warned a health trust he was collecting knives before he murdered an 83-year-old dog walker. Alexander Palmer, 24, stabbed Peter Wrighton 45 times in woodland near East Harling, Norfolk, in August. A letter from a Norfolk and Suffolk NHS Foundation Trust psychiatrist said Palmer was told to ""get rid"" of the weapons and would ""hopefully"" comply. The trust said an internal review into the case was under way. Palmer was described as ""dangerous"" when he was sentenced to life in prison for murdering Mr Wrighton, whose injuries were so severe police initially thought he had been killed by an animal. Palmer's parents said their warnings that their son was not taking his medication were ignored because health workers said they could only ""believe the patient"". His mother and stepfather - who do not want to be named - told BBC Look East he had been documented as saying it was ""inevitable"" he would kill. Peter Wrighton was walking his dogs alone when he was set upon from behind by Palmer The parents said they also told mental health professionals Palmer had knives and added the ""severity"" of his illness was not appreciated. ""Alex was purchasing knives. Once he knew I knew that he'd got them, he became more secretive,"" his mother said. In January 2017, Palmer, who lived in Cringleford near Norwich, told his GP he was experiencing more voices telling him to hurt people and had bought a hunting knife and a machete. Palmer, 24, subsequently visited a specialist at the Norfolk and Suffolk NHS Foundation Trust, who wrote to the GP. ""It is in his best interests to get rid of such weapons. Alex is aware of this and understands this and hopefully will act accordingly,"" the specialist wrote. The letter goes on to say that Palmer did not feel driven to act on his violent fantasies. This video can not be played Alexander Palmer's parents tell the BBC's Robby West warnings about their son were ignored Palmer had served in an Army commando regiment but was discharged in November 2015 after his head was ""crushed"" in a violent attack, his parents said. They said he returned home a ""different"" person but received multiple diagnoses from a string of professionals. His mother added: ""It says in the letter 'mum was concerned about what Alex was going to do with those knives'. There was no 'this is a mental health patient with a machete'."" His stepfather said: ""They were talking to him like he was a teenager as opposed to a trained soldier."" Dog walker's killer jailed for 28 years 'Voices' told accused to kill dog walker DNA of accused found on killed dog walker His mother said it had been noted in two reports that her son ""said he is going to kill somebody, how he is going to kill somebody and he's said it's inevitable"". ""They thought we were busybodies, interfering in Alex's mental health and care, because they were the experts,"" she added. Correspondence sent by mental health professionals over a two-year period before the murder documented Palmer's violent fantasies and the voices telling him to harm others. After he was sectioned in 2015 in Peterborough, medical notes said he wanted to ""get rid"" of people in the street by ""stringing them up and cutting them open"". Peter Wrighton's body was discovered on the edge of woodland by walkers A psychologist who treated Palmer at RAF Marham contacted police after reading press reports about Mr Wrighton's murder, saying she thought he could be responsible. His mother said Norfolk and Suffolk NHS Foundation Trust had ""missed chances"" to prevent the killing. ""I am not going to blame them solely, maybe we should have done more, but the amount of times we were treated like we were interfering, it didn't matter how desperate I was,"" she said. Palmer's stepfather added: ""Peter Wrighton paid the price and his family continues to do so."" In a statement, Norfolk and Suffolk NHS Foundation Trust said its independently-chaired internal review was due to finish this summer. It said it would ""incorporate information from all involved, including the families, carers and, of course, clinicians, along with any external parties who may have any relevant information"". ""The trust wishes to offer its continued support to the victim's family and to others who have been affected by these tragic violent events,"" it added. ""It would be inappropriate to pre-judge the findings of any review or to comment any further at this point."" His parents said their concerns about medical treatment for their son were continuing. Before Palmer was convicted, he was held at Rampton Secure Hospital but he is now serving his sentence in the general prison population at Wakefield jail, West Yorkshire. His mother said within two weeks he had carved the word 'help' into his arm and lost two stones. She believed he needed to be transferred to a psychiatric hospital. ""We are aware Alex has committed a horrendous crime... but we both believe he was let down... even now he is not getting any support in prison,""she told the BBC's Today programme. ""He still is an ill person."" The Ministry of Justice said it would not comment on individual cases.

"US releases Saudi Guantanamo convictAhmed al-Darbi, who pleaded guilty to a bomb attack on an oil tanker, is sent back to Saudi Arabia.","The 2002 attack on the French-owned Limburg oil tanker killed one and injured 12 others A Saudi man held at the US military prison at Guantanamo Bay who pleaded guilty to war crimes has been transferred back to Saudi Arabia. Ahmed al-Darbi pleaded guilty in 2014 to the 2002 bomb attack on an oil tanker in the waters off Yemen. The transfer was announced by the Pentagon in a statement on Wednesday. It is the first time under Donald Trump's presidency that a detainee has left the military prison at Guantanamo Bay, and leaves 40 prisoners there. Darbi's transfer was cleared after he met the terms of an agreement following his prior admission to guilt, the Pentagon statement said. Under the plea deal, Darbi agreed not to sue the US over his capture and the conditions of his confinement. He had previously alleged that he was subjected to waterboardingamong other forms of torture while in US custody, the Associated Press news agency reported in 2014. The US ""co-ordinated with the government of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to ensure the transfer took place in accordance with established standards for security and humane treatment,"" the Pentagon added. Last year, US military judges sentenced Darbi to 13 years' detention at the controversial Guantanamo Bay camp after he was found guilty of terrorism. Guantanamo Bay: A thorn in Cuba's side Should Guantanamo inmate artwork go on display? After waiving his right to appeal, he will now serve the remainder of his sentence in Saudi Arabia. Darbi, who was taken to the US prison in Cuba in August 2002, pleaded guilty to five charges related to the 2002 bombing of the MV Limburg, which killed one crewmember and injured 12. The tanker was French-owned and chartered to a Malaysian oil company. Prosecutors said Darbi had helped plan the bombing and bought the boats involved in the attack. In June 2002, he was arrested in Azerbaijan on a charge of possessing counterfeit currency. He was then transferred to American custody and was reportedly taken blindfolded to the US base in Bagram, Afghanistan, where he reportedly said he was tortured.
