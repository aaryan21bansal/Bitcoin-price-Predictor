Business leaders unite in Brexit warning,"David Davis is holding Brexit talks in Paris on Monday The UK risks losing jobs and investment without an urgent Brexit transition deal, Britain's five biggest business lobby groups have warned. In a joint letter being sent to Brexit Secretary David Davis, the groups including the CBI and Institute of Directors, say time is running out. The head of the CBI said firms wanted an agreement on the transition period by the end of the year. A government spokesman said the talks were ""making real, tangible progress"". The other lobby groups backing the letter are the British Chambers of Commerce, the Federation of Small Businesses, and the EEF manufacturers' body. CBI director-general Carolyn Fairbairn told the BBC: ""One of the big messages from firms is 'get on with it' on both sides. ""This is real, this is urgent and a transition agreement by the end of the year would help enormously to keep investment and jobs in the country,"" she said. Theresa May has suggested a transition period of about two years, with the UK and EU trading on broadly similar terms to now and payments to Brussels to meet Britain's budget commitments. Firms in the City of London are drawing up Brexit contingency plans But although EU negotiators have agreed to start preliminary work on a future relationship, they still want more concessions on the UK's so-called ""divorce payment"" before starting talks on trade and transition. The five business bodies - which together represent firms employing millions of people - are calling for more urgency, with less than a year and a half left until the UK leaves the European Union. Reality Check: Why Brexit transition may not buy time Brexit deadlock talk 'exaggerated' - Tusk Concern about the loss of UK jobs and investment was underlined last week when the boss of investment banking giant Goldman Sachs, Lloyd Blankfein,tweetedthat he will be ""spending a lot more time"" in Frankfurt. Earlier this month, the deputy governor of the Bank of England, Sam Woods,warnedthat the UK and the EU must agree a transition deal by Christmas or companies would start triggering contingency plans. And in a survey released on Monday, the EEF said that Brexit uncertainty was holding back the plans of manufacturing firms to invest in new plants and machinery. Mr Davis is holding Brexit talks in Paris on Monday after France appeared to emerge as the most hardline EU member state when it comes to the divorce bill. The prime minister is also due to update the Commons on the progress made during last week's summit of EU leaders in Brussels. It is thought that Mrs May will say that negotiations are ""deeply technical"", but she has not forgotten that the lives of millions of people are at the heart of the process. A spokesman for the Department for Exiting the European Union said the prime minister proposed a strictly time-limited implementation period in her Florence speech. He said: ""We are making real and tangible progress in a number of vital areas in negotiations. However, many of the issues that remain are linked to the discussions we need to have on our future relationship. ""That is why we are pleased that the EU has now agreed to start internal preparatory discussions on the framework for transitional arrangements as well as our future partnership.""

Man arrested after bowling alley siege,"This video can not be played Megan Westwood: ""We got evacuated one by one"" A suspected gunman was arrested after police ended a four-hour siege at a bowling alley in Nuneaton. Officers were called to MFA Bowl in Bermuda Park at around 14:30 BST on Sunday after reports a man with a shotgun had taken two hostages. A 53-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of making threats to kill after police stormed the building at about 18:30 BST. The suspect was treated for minor injuries. Two other men were uninjured. Midlands Live: Latest reaction to bowling alley raid; footballer not allowed to play because of his wedding ring Ch Supt Alex Franklin-Smith, from Warwickshire Police, said officers brought the incident to ""a peaceful resolution"". The siege was ""unconnected"" to terrorism, he added. Police said at about 19:00 BST that the cordon at the retail and leisure complex had been lifted and advised people they could now and any vehicles left there overnight. The gunman reportedly walked into MFA Bowl and yelled ""game over"" before ordering people to get out. About 40 or 50 people were said to be inside the complex at the time. This video can not be played Eyewitness: ""The guy ran up to the door with a gun"" Both of the hostages - a duty manager and a bowling lane host - were unharmed but treated for shock. Chris Clegg, operations director of MFA Bowl, said: ""It's obviously not an everyday situation. The ambulance, police were checking them and making sure they were OK."" The firm's chief executive Mehdi Amshar said he understood the man was known to a member of staff at the bowling alley. Specialist firearms officers and police negotiators were sent to the scene, and used flash bangs - which create a loud noise and bright light - to enter the premises. Allow Twitter content?

Warwickshire Police said officers were called to reports of a man - described by eyewitnesses as ""in his 40s"" with a gun ""slung"" over his shoulder - with a firearm at 14:30 BST. One witness, Chris Turner, told the BBC he was walking past the front entrance to the bowling alley when the man ""ran up to the door"". He had ""a gun in his hand"" and told him to ""get out of the area"", he said. Mr Turner said the man shouted at a crowd of people outside to leave, saying: ""I've already told you once."" This video can not be played 'We were trying to keep all the kids together' Eyewitnesses also spoke about how they fled the bowling alley, while others hid in toilets, as the gunman brandished a weapon above his head. Alex Mulholland said he was bowling when he looked up to see a man holding a gun over his head. ""He was saying 'game over, game over', everyone was shouting, screaming, panicking, trying to get out and I didn't know what to make of it, really,"" he said.  ""I ran, got my things as quickly as I could and got out of there."" Other businesses in the leisure park, including a children's soft play centre and restaurants, were put into lockdown. Families inside the soft play centre told the BBC they barricaded the front door with tables and chairs. Warwickshire Police said the incident was unconnected to terrorism A number of ambulances were dispatched to the area around the bowling alley Kelly Perrett, who was at the Frankie and Benny's restaurant, told the BBC she was ""hiding in the toilet with about 20 people"". ""It looks like police have got the bowling alley surrounded. The police told me that the gunman is near the door with a hostage,"" she said as the incident unfolded. This video can not be played Footage posted on social media showed police officers at the scene in Bermuda Park Megan Westward said she was about to leave a children's soft play centre when staff told her to move away from the windows. ""There are quite a few bullet proof vans,"" she said. ""We've just seen an air ambulance take off, there are ambulances and there are police in full body suits with guns."" She was then evacuated to a nearby hotel. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"US wiped Raqqa off map, says Russia","This video can not be played The BBC's Feras Kilani was in Raqqa with anti-IS troops Russia has accused the US-led coalition of bombing the Syrian city of Raqqa ""off the face of the earth"" during the fight against so-called Islamic State. The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a US-backed alliance of Kurdish and Arab fighters, took Raqqa last week. Pictures suggest much of Raqqa is in ruins, and Moscow compared it to the Allied destruction of the German city of Dresden in World War Two. The US-led coalition says it tried to minimise risks to civilians. Russia has itself been accused ofcommitting war crimesfor its bombardment of Aleppo last year. UN war crimes investigatorsin Junethat there had been a ""staggering loss of civilian life"" in Raqqa. Syrian activists say between 1,130 and 1,873 civilians were killed and that many of the civilian casualties were the result of the intense US-led air strikes that helped the SDF, an alliance of Kurdish and Arab militias, advance. Islamic State group: The full story The city fit for no-one Inside 'Islamic State': A Raqqa diary A Russian defence ministry spokesman said the ruins evoked the destruction of Dresden. ""Raqqa has inherited the fate of Dresden in 1945, wiped off the face of the earth by Anglo-American bombardments,"" Maj Gen Igor Konashenkov said. He said the West now appeared to be hurrying to send financial aid to Raqqa as a way of covering up evidence of its crimes. Allied bombing destroyed most of Dresden in 1945 The US-led coalition said it had adhered to strict targeting processes and procedures aimed to minimise risks to civilians. The SDF declared victory in Raqqa last week after a four-month battle to retake the city from IS, which had ruled it for three years. They say they have since taken the al-Omar oilfield, Syria's largest and a significant source of revenue for IS. The SDF's fight against the militants is now focused on their last stronghold in Syria's eastern province of Deir al-Zour. The Syrian army, supported by Russian airpower and Iranian-backed militias, is also attacking the extremist group.

Budget 'ambush' and transition deal plea,"The Daily Mirror leads with a claim that50 children a week are now referred to gender realignment clinics,external- some as young as four. A gender dysphoria expert and a clinical psychologist tell the paper the rise in cases could be the result of a growing acceptance of gender issues. However, another gender expert cautions that it could be be ""a fad among parents who indulge their children"". Elsewhere on Monday, business leaders take to the Financial Times to""sharply criticise the state of capitalism"",external. A panel of more than 50 leading figures in finance, business and policymaking describe capitalism as in need of reform, as ""management greed, corporate tax dodging and investor short-termism"" have caused it to ""lose its way"", focusing too much on delivering for shareholders, rather than increasing productivity. The Times,externalreports that US President Donald Trump's dismissal of so much of the media as ""fake news"" has led to a rise in young Americans paying for newspaper subscriptions. Online payments for news have gone up 7% in the past year in the United States. The Times says Mr Trump's ""tirades"" have persuaded millennials that print media is cool again. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the paper argues that investment in quality journalism is needed now more than ever. ""No mercy for the jihadis"",,externaldeclares the Daily Express, as it welcomes the suggestion by government minister Rory Stewart that the ""only way"" to deal with British fighters for the Islamic State group is to kill them. In its comment piece, the paper says it is ""refreshing to hear a government minister speak forthrightly"" on the issue. ""Those we spare will not hesitate to return to our shores and murder us,"" it goes on, adding: ""They have forfeited any right to mercy."" As the government brings in measures to tackle so-called health tourism in the UK, the Daily Telegraph reports that there has been a trebling in the past three years in the number ofBritish nationals seeking healthcare overseas,external. The paper says record waiting times prompted almost 144,000 people to go abroad for treatment last year, compared with 48,000 in 2014. In other news, the Queen and Prince Philip are keeping their platinum wedding anniversary celebrations low key by refusing to hold a national celebration to mark the event next month, according to theDaily Express,external. The paper says they will be the first Royal couple in Britain to celebrate 70 years of marriage. But it points out they have a little way to go to beat the world record for the longest Royal marriage: Japan's Prince Mikasa and Yuriko, Princess Mikasa, were together for 75 years. Finally, the tabloids offer up some grim weather prospects for the coming season. The Daily Mirror warns of thepotential for 120mph (193km/h) winds,external. The Daily Star predicts there will bea calm before the storm,external- a mini-heatwave later this week, with temperatures of 21C (70F).

Dubai Scot jailed for three months,"Jamie Harron was convicted of public indecency over the incident in a Dubai bar A Scottish man has been sentenced to three months in jail for touching a man's hip in a Dubai bar. Jamie Harron, from Stirling, was arrested in July and charged with public indecency. He claimed he had simply been trying to avoid spilling his drink when he touched the man. The 27-year-old electrician had already been sentenced toa month in jail for drinking beerand still faces further court proceedings. The businessman who made the complaint against Mr Harron later withdrew it, but prosecutors in Dubai continued with the case. News of the three-month sentence was released by campaign group Detained in Dubai, which has been supporting Mr Harron. Mr Harron was on a stopover break in the United Arab Emirates when the incident happened The group said lawyers acting for him would appeal and they would be pursuing a civil action against his accusers. A statement from the group said: ""Today Jamie Harron was sentenced to three months imprisonment for accidentally brushing the hip of an Arab customer at the Rock Bottom bar in Dubai. ""Key witnesses to the incident were not called upon to testify to discredit the allegations. ""Jamie will appeal the verdict, though this will prolong his increasingly difficult circumstances in Dubai, and compound the enormous financial losses he has suffered as a consequence of the ongoing case."" Detained in Dubai's chief executive Radha Stirling said Mr Harron was ""understandably distraught"". She added: ""Now Jamie has been sentenced to three months, there is no telling whether a judgment on appeal will be better or worse. ""He has already suffered tremendously as a result of these allegations, and now faces the likelihood of incarceration. ""His family was unable to visit him during this critical time because they faced a very real risk of imprisonment themselves under the UAE's cybercrime laws which forbid criticism of the government. ""At this point, Jamie will definitely be pursuing civil action against his accusers when he does eventually return home, as it appears that he will not be able to find justice in the UAE. ""He is angry, disappointed, and dreads what may happen next. He feels betrayed and exploited by the system, which did not investigate the reports of key witnesses in his defence and led him to believe that the case would be dropped."" Mr Harron, who worked as an electrician in Afghanistan, was on a two-day stopover in the United Arab Emirates at the time of the incident on 15 July. He is still to face court on two other charges stemming from the case - one of consuming alcohol, and one for allegedly making a rude gesture.

WHO cancels Mugabe ambassador role,"Mr Mugabe often travels abroad for medical treatment The World Health Organization has revoked the appointment of Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe as a goodwill ambassador following a widespread outcry. ""I have listened carefully to all who have expressed their concerns,""WHO head Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said,externalin a statement. He had previously praised Zimbabwe for its commitment to public health. But critics pointed out that Zimbabwe's healthcare system had collapsed in recent years. During the first 20 years of his 37-year rule, Mr Mugabe widely expanded health care, but the system has badly been affected by the collapse of the Zimbabwean economy since 2000. Staff often go without pay, medicines are in short supply, and Mr Mugabe, who has outlived the average life expectancy in his country by three decades, travels abroad for medical treatment. Africa's 'medical tourist' presidents Profile: Robert Mugabe Mr Tedros said he had consulted with the Zimbabwean government and decided that rescinding Mr Mugabe's position was ""in the best interests of"" the WHO. He said he remained ""firmly committed to working with all countries and their leaders"" to build universal health care. Mr Tedros, elected in May under the slogan ""let's prove the impossible is possible"" had said he hoped Mr Mugabe would use his goodwill ambassador role to ""influence his peers in the region"". But the appointment was met by a wave of surprise and condemnation. The UK government, the Canadian prime minister, the Wellcome Trust, the NCD Alliance, UN Watch, the World Heart Federation, Action Against Smoking and Zimbabwean lawyers and social media users were among those who criticised the decision. The BBC's Andrew Harding in Johannesburg reports that Mr Mugabe's supporters are likely to see this episode as Western meddling in Africa. Imogen Foulkes, BBC News, Geneva Following the storm of criticism from human rights groups and expressions of dismay from many member states, the WHO had little choice but to cancel its plan to make Robert Mugabe a goodwill ambassador. The about-face will raise questions over the leadership of the WHO's new director general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. The decision to honour Mr Mugabe is likely to have been taken several weeks ago, and at no point did Mr Tedros seem aware that appointing as goodwill ambassador a man who has been accused of human rights abuses, and of neglecting to the point of collapse his own country's health service, might be controversial. The WHO was supposed to be embarking on a new era of reform. Instead, it is mired in a public relations disaster. Africa's 'medical tourist' presidents Robert Mugabe - hero or villain?

The gunman reportedly walked into MFA Bowl and yelled ""game over"" before ordering people to get out. About 40 or 50 people were said to be inside the complex at the time. This video can not be played Eyewitness: ""The guy ran up to the door with a gun"" Both of the hostages - a duty manager and a bowling lane host - were unharmed but treated for shock. Chris Clegg, operations director of MFA Bowl, said: ""It's obviously not an everyday situation. The ambulance, police were checking them and making sure they were OK."" The firm's chief executive Mehdi Amshar said he understood the man was known to a member of staff at the bowling alley. Specialist firearms officers and police negotiators were sent to the scene, and used flash bangs - which create a loud noise and bright light - to enter the premises. Allow Twitter content?

Borrow more to fix housing crisis - Javid,"This video can not be played Communities Secretary Sajid Javid: 'We are looking at new investments' The government should borrow money to fund the building of hundreds of thousands of new homes, a cabinet minister says. Communities Secretary Sajid Javid said taking advantage of record-low interest rates ""can be the right thing if done sensibly"". Housing charity Shelter said his comments suggested the government was ""going in the right direction"". Labour said spending on new affordable homes had been ""slashed"" since 2010. It comes as Mr Javidlaunched an eight-week review of housing, in which he has called on the industry to offer solutions to the home-buying and selling process. Reality Check: What's the problem with housing? Is Help to Buy working? The government has admitted house-building in the UK is failing to keep up with demand, and has described the current market as ""broken"". Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr show, Mr Javid said successive governments had failed to build enough homes, and that the housing crisis Britain faced was ""the biggest barrier to social progress in our country today"". This video can not be played Want to buy a house? Under 25? Watch this He said between 275,000 and 300,000 homes a year - a level of house-building not seen since the 1960s - were needed in England alone to help tackle the shortage in affordable housing. ""We are looking at new investments and there will be announcements,"" he said, saying these would come in next month's Budget. Asked about the change in tone from the Tories' previous approach to borrowing, Mr Javid said a distinction should be drawn between ""vitally important"" deficit reduction and ""investing for the future"" in housing and infrastructure. ""So for example... you borrow more to invest in the infrastructure that leads to more housing - take advantage of some of the record-low interest rates that we have. I think we should absolutely be considering that,"" he said. Analysis by BBC political correspondent Jonathan Blake Not so long ago, ministers would repeat at every opportunity the need to ""balance the books"". Austerity was necessary to cut the deficit - to eliminate the gap between the amount the government spent and how much it received through taxes. Now though, a cabinet minister openly suggests borrowing more money to fund a major policy. So what's changed? The economic impact of the Brexit vote means the chancellor's catchphrase is the politically more convenient but far less catchy ""commitment to fiscal discipline"". Not unlike Labour's ""fiscal credibility rule"", the Conservatives now seem comfortable with borrowing large amounts to fund long-term investment projects. The government will be hoping that as well as new homes, it will get support from voters in return. Recent announcements by the government include a pledge by Theresa May at the Conservative Party conference this month of an extra Â£2bn to build an additional 25,000 social homes. Earlier this year, the government unveiled a newhousing strategy,externalfor England, which included giving councils powers to pressurise developers to start to build on land they own, and building more affordable homes to buy and rent. And last month Mr Javid promised a ""top-to-bottom review"" of social housing in the UK. Kate Webb, of Shelter, said: ""What the government are now talking about is exactly what they should have been talking about all along."" At a time of low interest rates, borrowing for housing was a ""good investment"" for the government, she said, but the key would be the types of houses that are actually built. Where can I afford to rent or buy? House prices: Have they actually gone up? How to own a home by the age of 25 These have to be affordable to, for example, a teaching assistant or a shop worker, she added. Councillor Martin Tett, of the Local Government Association, called for councils to be given the power and funding to build houses. Labour's housing spokesman John Healey said there had already been plenty of ""hot air"" from ministers on house-building. ""Any promise of new investment is welcome, but the reality is spending on new affordable homes has been slashed since 2010, so new affordable house-building is at a 24 year low."" He promised Labour would build 100,000 ""genuinely affordable"" homes per year. Home-buying review to tackle gazumping Are house prices back from the crash?

Spain denies 'coup' against Catalonia,"This video can not be played Many pictures showing Spanish police acting violently during the referendum were fake - Spanish foreign minister The Spanish Foreign Minister, Alfonso Dastis, has denied that his government's move to reassert control over Catalonia amounts to a ""coup"". The speaker of the Catalan parliament, Carme Forcadell, called measures announced by the government on Saturday a ""de facto coup d'Ã©tat"". ""If anyone has attempted a coup, it is the Catalan regional government,"" Mr Dastis told the BBC. Madrid acted after regional leaders refused to halt an independence drive. Anxious independence supporters listened to Carles Puigdemont's speech on their smartphones in Barcelona The Catalan government, led by President Carles Puigdemont, points to the majority Yes vote in a referendum on independence it held on 1 October despite a ban by Spain's  Constitutional Court. Of the 43% of Catalans said to have taken part, 90% voted in favour of independence, it said. Unionist parties who won about 40% of the vote at the 2015 Catalan elections boycotted the ballot and many anti-independence supporters stayed away, arguing it was not valid. Spain faces delicate task over Catalan rule The crisis in 300 words On Saturday, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy announced plans to sack Catalonia's regional government and curtail some of the freedoms of its parliament. This video can not be played Police inspector: 'We are not politicians' Reports suggest the central authorities will also seek to take control of Catalonia's local police force and its public broadcaster, TV3. ""If there is a coup d'Ã©tat, this is one followed by Mr Puigdemont and his government,"" Mr Dastis toldThe Andrew Marr Show. ""What we are doing is following strictly the provision of our constitution,"" he said, describing it as a ""carbon copy of the German constitution"".

The government itselfapologised to injured demonstratorsdays after the vote, as a result of which 1,066 people required medical attention, according to the Catalan health department. The ferocity of the police response was reported at the time by the BBC's Tom Burridge. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Lt-Col Antonio Tejero de Molina (C) took MPs hostage in 1981 The French term literally means a ""blow against the state"" and refers to the sudden, usually violent, overthrow of a country's government. Catalan nationalists regard their region as a nation and state in its own right, a definition Spain does not accept. Spain last sawa coup attempt on 23 February 1981,externalwhen soldiers and police stormed parliament, firing guns and shouting orders. The rebellion was suppressed but came as a startling reminder of the country's recent military dictatorship (1939-75) under Gen Francisco Franco. President Puigdemont has described the move to impose direct rule as the worst attack on Catalonia's institutions since Franco, when the region lost its autonomy. ""Return to the past"" is how Catalonia's Catalan-language, pro-independence El Punt Avui sums up Saturday's developments on its front page. Inan opinion piece,external, Xevi Xirgo argues that Madrid is mounting a ""coup d'Ã©tat"" to submit Catalonia to central rule in a way not seen since the 18th Century. Inan editorial in El PeriÃ³dico,external, Spain's fifth-biggest newspaper which publishes both in Spanish and Catalan, Enric HernÃ ndez argues that Madrid responded in kind to ""the aggression of the independence camp"", which ignored Spanish law to hold a ""sham referendum"". HernÃ ndez calls on Mr Puigdemont to agree to Mr Rajoy's call for early regional elections as the best way out of the crisis or else face a ""social revolt with unforeseeable consequences"". Meanwhile El PaÃ­s, Spain's biggest paper, a left-of-centre daily, endorses the government inan editorial entitled ""The democratic state responds"",externaland declares that Mr Rajoy is acting to ""restore constitutional legality in Catalonia"". ""Democracy not only has the right to defend itself but a duty to do so,"" it says. The Spanish Senate is expected to approve the government's measures on Friday along with a proposal for fresh regional elections. This video can not be played Catalan president's message to Europe There are reports that the Catalan parliament plans to meet the same day to debate the crackdown. Mr Puigdemont has said his government will not accept direct rule. On Saturday, an estimated 450,000 people protested in the regional capital Barcelona, chanting ""independence"" and ""freedom"". Appeals by separatists for outside intervention in the crisis have had little effect, with the EU takingthe position it is an internal affair for Spain to decide. The man who wants to break up Spain Spain has been a multi-party, constitutional monarchy for nearly 40 years with some of the most liberal laws in Europe. It was one of the earliest EU states to adopt same-sex marriage, for instance (2005). A pro-independence poster in Barcelona imagines Franco (left) kissing Rajoy The late dictator is particularly reviled among nationalists and leftists in Catalonia, a stronghold of the Republican side during the Civil War. The suggestion that the current Spanish government is employing Francoist tactics touches a sensitive spot within Prime Minister Rajoy's Popular Party, which was founded by one of Franco's own ministers, Manuel Fraga. However, Mr Rajoy has the support of two of the main opposition parties, the centrist Ciudadanos and the Socialists (PSOE). The PSOE's power base is solidly anti-Franco, particularly in southern regions like Andalusia, which supplied some of the extra police officers deployed in Catalonia for the referendum. So the reasons why the rest of Spain is uniting behind tough measures to curb Catalan separatism are more complex.

Murder arrest over toddler window fall,"A woman has been arrested on suspicion of murdering an 18-month-old boy who fell from a sixth-floor flat window. It ""quickly became apparent"" the boy had died when police were called to Newcastle House in Barkerend Road, Bradford, at 17:10 BST on Saturday. A 23-year-old woman arrested on suspicion of murder is receiving medical assessment in custody. One woman told how she, her husband and a friend tried to save the child, who was naked when he fell. Danuta Tomaszewicz, 59, said she had been on her phone, looking out of the window from a first-floor flat when she suddenly noticed the child on the ground below. She thought the child was a doll at first, she said. Her niece, Monika Tomaszewicz, said: ""She screamed for help and her husband and his friend ran downstairs. ""The friend took his shirt off because the baby was naked."" She said the ambulance arrived after about 20 minutes. Mrs Tomaszewicz's niece added: ""She could not sleep at all last night. ""She doesn't know how she is going to live here as every time she looks out of the window she will see the baby. ""They tried their best for the baby."" Andrew White, 53, said he lived on the same landing as the flat where the baby fell. He said a couple with two young children live there. Mr White, a father-of-three with four grandchildren, said: ""They are a nice young couple who keep themselves to themselves which is normal here."" West Yorkshire Police said it was an ""extremely traumatic incident"". Det Supt Nick Wallen said: ""Specially trained officers are working to support the child's family members and those who witnessed what took place. ""It is no exaggeration to say those who witnessed this incident will have been deeply traumatised by what they saw."" Police said they were not looking for anyone else in connection with the death. Newcastle House, which is in the city centre, is a seven-storey block of flats with shops on the ground floor. An unnamed resident, who lives on the same landing where the boy had fallen from, said: ""There's quite a high turnover of people in these flats, you wouldn't necessarily know your neighbours. I just keep to myself."" He said there were people of different nationalities living in the block. The resident said he saw police activity in the flats on Saturday night but only discovered what happened the next morning by watching the news. ""It's horrible,"" he said. ""It's hard to take.""

US 'wiped Raqqa off Earth' - Russia,"This video can not be played The BBC's Feras Kilani was in Raqqa with anti-IS troops Russia has accused the US-led coalition of bombing the Syrian city of Raqqa ""off the face of the earth"" during the fight against so-called Islamic State. The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a US-backed alliance of Kurdish and Arab fighters, took Raqqa last week. Pictures suggest much of Raqqa is in ruins, and Moscow compared it to the Allied destruction of the German city of Dresden in World War Two. The US-led coalition says it tried to minimise risks to civilians. Russia has itself been accused ofcommitting war crimesfor its bombardment of Aleppo last year. UN war crimes investigatorsin Junethat there had been a ""staggering loss of civilian life"" in Raqqa. Syrian activists say between 1,130 and 1,873 civilians were killed and that many of the civilian casualties were the result of the intense US-led air strikes that helped the SDF, an alliance of Kurdish and Arab militias, advance. Islamic State group: The full story The city fit for no-one Inside 'Islamic State': A Raqqa diary A Russian defence ministry spokesman said the ruins evoked the destruction of Dresden. ""Raqqa has inherited the fate of Dresden in 1945, wiped off the face of the earth by Anglo-American bombardments,"" Maj Gen Igor Konashenkov said. He said the West now appeared to be hurrying to send financial aid to Raqqa as a way of covering up evidence of its crimes. Allied bombing destroyed most of Dresden in 1945 The US-led coalition said it had adhered to strict targeting processes and procedures aimed to minimise risks to civilians. The SDF declared victory in Raqqa last week after a four-month battle to retake the city from IS, which had ruled it for three years. They say they have since taken the al-Omar oilfield, Syria's largest and a significant source of revenue for IS. The SDF's fight against the militants is now focused on their last stronghold in Syria's eastern province of Deir al-Zour. The Syrian army, supported by Russian airpower and Iranian-backed militias, is also attacking the extremist group.

'No Brexit disruption' for Brits in Spain,"Spain is the most popular destination for Britons living in other EU countries Britons living in Spain will not have their lives ""disrupted"" after Brexit - even if there is no UK-EU deal, the Spanish foreign minister says. The two sides are yet to reach an agreement about how the rights of expats will be protected after Brexit. Theresa May has called for ""urgency"" from the EU side in finding a solution. And speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, Alfonso Dastis sought to reassure more than 300,000 Britons living in Spain. Labour thinks the UK's heading for a 'no deal' on Brexit ""I do hope that there will be a deal,"" the minister said. ""If there is no deal we will make sure that the lives of ordinary people who are in Spain, the UK people, is not disrupted. ""As you know, the relationship between the UK and Spain is a very close one in terms of economic relations and also social exchanges. ""Over 17 million Brits come to Spain every year and many of them live here or retire here and we want to keep it that way as much as possible."" This video can not be played British expats sum up Brexit in one word According to the Office for National Statistics, Spain is host to the largest number of British citizens living in the EU (308,805), and just over a third (101,045) are aged 65 and over. Citizens' rights are one of the first subjects being negotiated in the first round of Brexit talks - which have moved so slowly there has been increased talk of no deal at all being reached between the two sides. The role of the European Court of Justice in guaranteeing the rights of EU nationals in the UK has been a sticking point. The EU argues this must continue, but ministers say the EU court will no longer have jurisdiction in the UK after Brexit. Ahead of last week's Brussels summit, Mrs May said the two sides were ""in touching distance"" of finding an agreement. On Monday she is expected to tell MPs she will ""put people first"" in the ""complicated and deeply technical"" negotiations.

Police 'end' Nuneaton bowling alley siege,"This video can not be played Megan Westwood: ""We got evacuated one by one"" A suspected gunman was arrested after police ended a four-hour siege at a bowling alley in Nuneaton. Officers were called to MFA Bowl in Bermuda Park at around 14:30 BST on Sunday after reports a man with a shotgun had taken two hostages. A 53-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of making threats to kill after police stormed the building at about 18:30 BST. The suspect was treated for minor injuries. Two other men were uninjured. Midlands Live: Latest reaction to bowling alley raid; footballer not allowed to play because of his wedding ring Ch Supt Alex Franklin-Smith, from Warwickshire Police, said officers brought the incident to ""a peaceful resolution"". The siege was ""unconnected"" to terrorism, he added. Police said at about 19:00 BST that the cordon at the retail and leisure complex had been lifted and advised people they could now and any vehicles left there overnight. The gunman reportedly walked into MFA Bowl and yelled ""game over"" before ordering people to get out. About 40 or 50 people were said to be inside the complex at the time. This video can not be played Eyewitness: ""The guy ran up to the door with a gun"" Both of the hostages - a duty manager and a bowling lane host - were unharmed but treated for shock. Chris Clegg, operations director of MFA Bowl, said: ""It's obviously not an everyday situation. The ambulance, police were checking them and making sure they were OK."" The firm's chief executive Mehdi Amshar said he understood the man was known to a member of staff at the bowling alley. Specialist firearms officers and police negotiators were sent to the scene, and used flash bangs - which create a loud noise and bright light - to enter the premises. Allow Twitter content?

Police dealing with Nuneaton incident,"This video can not be played Megan Westwood: ""We got evacuated one by one"" A suspected gunman was arrested after police ended a four-hour siege at a bowling alley in Nuneaton. Officers were called to MFA Bowl in Bermuda Park at around 14:30 BST on Sunday after reports a man with a shotgun had taken two hostages. A 53-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of making threats to kill after police stormed the building at about 18:30 BST. The suspect was treated for minor injuries. Two other men were uninjured. Midlands Live: Latest reaction to bowling alley raid; footballer not allowed to play because of his wedding ring Ch Supt Alex Franklin-Smith, from Warwickshire Police, said officers brought the incident to ""a peaceful resolution"". The siege was ""unconnected"" to terrorism, he added. Police said at about 19:00 BST that the cordon at the retail and leisure complex had been lifted and advised people they could now and any vehicles left there overnight. The gunman reportedly walked into MFA Bowl and yelled ""game over"" before ordering people to get out. About 40 or 50 people were said to be inside the complex at the time. This video can not be played Eyewitness: ""The guy ran up to the door with a gun"" Both of the hostages - a duty manager and a bowling lane host - were unharmed but treated for shock. Chris Clegg, operations director of MFA Bowl, said: ""It's obviously not an everyday situation. The ambulance, police were checking them and making sure they were OK."" The firm's chief executive Mehdi Amshar said he understood the man was known to a member of staff at the bowling alley. Specialist firearms officers and police negotiators were sent to the scene, and used flash bangs - which create a loud noise and bright light - to enter the premises. Allow Twitter content?

Warwickshire Police said officers were called to reports of a man - described by eyewitnesses as ""in his 40s"" with a gun ""slung"" over his shoulder - with a firearm at 14:30 BST. One witness, Chris Turner, told the BBC he was walking past the front entrance to the bowling alley when the man ""ran up to the door"". He had ""a gun in his hand"" and told him to ""get out of the area"", he said. Mr Turner said the man shouted at a crowd of people outside to leave, saying: ""I've already told you once."" This video can not be played 'We were trying to keep all the kids together' Eyewitnesses also spoke about how they fled the bowling alley, while others hid in toilets, as the gunman brandished a weapon above his head. Alex Mulholland said he was bowling when he looked up to see a man holding a gun over his head. ""He was saying 'game over, game over', everyone was shouting, screaming, panicking, trying to get out and I didn't know what to make of it, really,"" he said.  ""I ran, got my things as quickly as I could and got out of there."" Other businesses in the leisure park, including a children's soft play centre and restaurants, were put into lockdown. Families inside the soft play centre told the BBC they barricaded the front door with tables and chairs. Warwickshire Police said the incident was unconnected to terrorism A number of ambulances were dispatched to the area around the bowling alley Kelly Perrett, who was at the Frankie and Benny's restaurant, told the BBC she was ""hiding in the toilet with about 20 people"". ""It looks like police have got the bowling alley surrounded. The police told me that the gunman is near the door with a hostage,"" she said as the incident unfolded. This video can not be played Footage posted on social media showed police officers at the scene in Bermuda Park Megan Westward said she was about to leave a children's soft play centre when staff told her to move away from the windows. ""There are quite a few bullet proof vans,"" she said. ""We've just seen an air ambulance take off, there are ambulances and there are police in full body suits with guns."" She was then evacuated to a nearby hotel. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Bird hunters risk steep cliffs to catch gannets,"The Faroe Islands are home to an impressive array of seabirds but there is only one colony of gannets, located on the most westerly island, Mykines. The young birds are considered a delicacy by the islanders. So, once a year, hunters abseil down the cliffs to catch the birds. It takes eight fit men to carry the 150m of thick rope which will form the essential lifeline for the bird catchers. As thick as a man's wrist, it has to be lugged along a cliff-top path and then across a narrow gorge to the adjoining island of Mykinesholmur. Oscar Joensen lays out the long rope needed for the climb Skirting a colony of chattering puffins outside their burrows, I followed the men for an hour towards the gannet cliffs, 150m high, and dropping almost vertically into the Atlantic swell. Carrying the rope out to the bird cliffs takes a strong team As dusk fell I could see the ghostly white shapes of the adult birds, cruising silently above the darkening ocean. About 50 men had taken the small ferry out to the island to help with the hunt, essential now that Mykines's single village only has about a dozen full-time residents. Mykines village only has a dozen full-time residents On a steep grassy incline we stopped to rest. In the half-light, food supplies were shared - bread andskerpikjot, fermented legs of lamb, which the men carved with sharp hunting knives at their belts. Once it was dark, the final climb to the cliff edge where the birds nest began. Nesting gannets can be seen on the northerly cliffs of Mykinesholmur One by one the men stepped into a simple harness cushioned with sheep's wool, and abseiled backwards down the rock face. The drop is sheer and within seconds they were out of sight. Once on a suitable ledge below, each of them removed the safety harness and the rope was hauled back up for the next man. Men from the rope team are needed to pull the hunters back up the cliffs ""Hiva! Hiva!"" came the cry to pull together. Once about a dozen men had been deposited on ledges out of sight, the rest of us could only wait, and in my case imagine the slaughter going on below. From Our Own Correspondenthas insight and analysis from BBC journalists, correspondents and writers from around the world Listen on iPlayer, getthe podcastor listen on the BBC World Service, or on Radio 4 on Thursdays at 11:00 and Saturdays at 11:30 BST The constant wind chilled me to the bone, and groups of men lay in the grass through the darkest hours talking about the hunt, wondering how manysula,as they are called locally, would be caught. They seemed impervious to the cold, bred in a country where even in summer it rarely gets above 16C (60F). The hunters were sanguine about the process. ""We look forward to the gannet hunt,"" a young man named Johannus explained. ""The seabirds, the sheep and even the pilot whales which we catch occasionally are all part of the traditional Faroese diet. That's our culture,"" he insisted. ""We don't want to depend on imported food from plastic packets and eat animals kept in captivity all of their lives."" This young gannet still has down rather than feathers, so it will be spared At around 04:30 in the morning a watery dawn light crept across the sea, and we returned to the rope. Slowly and with much effort, hundreds of dead birds tied by the neck in bunches were hauled up. These chicks, just a day or two away from flying for the first time, were large, over 4kg (8lb) in weight and perhaps 80cm (30in) tall. And then the men came. They were an extraordinary sight, faces and hands sometimes as black as if they had been down a coalmine. Reeking of the oily, fishy smell of gannet guano, many had scratched hands and ripped clothes, caused by the birds' spear-like beaks. A gannet's nostrils are inside, rather than outside, its beak The last man up was Espern, the island's chief gannet catcher. Extraordinarily fit and strong he walked up the vertical cliff with the rope in one hand and two live gannets held by the neck in the other. A swift expert cut to the back of the neck and in a second the great grey creatures hung lifelessly from a beefy human hand. But the night's work was not over. Now the birds had to be thrown from the cliffs into the sea to be picked up by a small fishing boat which would deliver them to the village jetty. Otherwise, in rougher weather, the men would have to carry the rope and climbing equipment as well as around 500 birds, all the way back to the village. A boat waits at the bottom of the cliffs to collect the birds Later, after a hearty serving of soup, we were allowed to choose two birds each, as a reward for helping raise and lower the rope during the long cold night. We had all been up for the best part of two days and a night, but everyone was in a good mood. ""Now you know what to do, you must come again next year,"" said Johannus. ""And maybe try going down the cliff next time."" It was a generous offer. But I know I'm simply not brave enough.

Spain faces delicate task over Catalan rule,"Spain's prime minister rarely talks in such stark language. But his message to Catalonia's devolved government, which spearheads the pro-independence movement, was blunt. He said Madrid would remove its leaders and impose direct rule. Mariano Rajoy is conservative by party, and in his political style. He has meandered his way through other crises; a financial one for his country; a corruption scandal that tainted his party. His ""keep calm and carry on"" strategy worked each time. But Catalonia today is a completely different ball game. This Spanish region has enjoyed a high degree of autonomy since the 1980s - only the Basque Country has more. Reality Check: Would Catalonia be a viable country? Cases for and against independence The crisis in 300 words It's also important to note that in cultural terms, Catalonia is arguably the most distinct of Spain's regions. The Catalan language is widely spoken and from the folkloric dance of Sardana to human towers, there is a long list of cultural traditions here, which enforce the sense of Catalan identity. And a large part of Catalan society will see Madrid's planned takeover as an affront to their whole way of life. Competitions to build tall and elaborate human towers are a common sight at Catalan regional festivals The word among the pro-independence camp is that, in the coming weeks, peaceful direct action will be the order of the day. The Spanish government has outlined a clear strategy, couched within a legal framework. Advisers close to the prime minister emphasise that the decision to intervene was not taken lightly but they also argue that Mr Rajoy was left with no choice. At stake, they say, is Spain's entire system of governance; no other Western government would allow a regional administration to ride roughshod over its constitution and laws. Catalonia's independence, or a legitimate vote on the matter, has never been and never will be an option, they exclaim. But over the next days Mariano Rajoy's government faces an unfathomably delicate task. It must now reassert Madrid's authority in Catalonia. The practicalities of that won't be straightforward. Some within Catalonia's civil service will be die-hard supporters of independence. Others will simply hate the concept of Madrid being ultimately in charge. Catalonia's regional police force, Mossos, insists it remains impartial. ""We are policemen, not politicians,"" Inspector Albert Oliva told me. This video can not be played Police inspector: 'We are not politicians' But he admits that his force is in the middle of a ""political hurricane."" Over the coming weeks the loyalties of Catalan police will be tested to the absolute limit. Before we reach that point, the Spanish senate will have to approve Madrid's proposals. That could take days. In the meantime, the soon-to-be-sacked Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont will try and convene the regional parliament, before it is stripped of powers. If that happens, he will probably make a more emphatic declaration of independence. The vast majority of Spaniards will, in turn, declare that meaningless. But every twist and turn from now will play into an already febrile political atmosphere. Every time I speak to a taxi driver or an old lady pushing her shopping trolley down the street, be it in Catalonia or in the neighbouring region of Aragon, people's views, on both sides, have hardened. To the naked eye of a tourist, Spain is a country at ease, a country of sun, sea, beautiful buildings and friendly people. Scratch below and there are deep political divisions. And in Catalonia the situation is becoming fractured beyond belief. Spain denies 'coup' against Catalonia Cases for and against independence Would Catalonia be a viable country?

Why more people are running across America,"Steve and Paula Boone have run more than 1,000 marathons between them Why are more people running marathons in all 50 states - and what does it say about modern America? In 1988, Steve Boone was a computer systems designer who played football in his spare time. One of his customers was training for the Houston Marathon. He bet Steve - a 39-year-old who had never run 26 miles - that he couldn't finish the race. It's safe to say Steve won that bet. He finished the 1988 Houston Marathon, and has returned to the race every year since. The 2018 event will be his 31st in a row, and his 700th marathon in total. The only downside? ""It was a principle bet,"" says Steve. ""No money at stake."" In 1997, Steve was at the Boston Marathon, waiting outside a hotel for a bus that didn't turn up. By this point, he had run more than 100 marathons, including one in all 50 states. He had the idea after running in San Francisco. ""It was one of those obsessions,"" he admits. While waiting for the bus, he got talking to one of his fellow runners, Paula. ""By the time we walked back to the hotel we were best friends,"" he says. They were married 18 months later. In 2001, the Boones decidedto start a club for people who had run - or wanted to run - marathons in all 50 states,external. They began with 82 members; Steve thought they might get 400 or 500 total. At the last count, there were 4,326 members. In total, more than 1,500 have finished all 50 states. Of the finishers, more than a third are female, and almost all come from the US, although there are members from Brazil to Bermuda. But the interesting thing isn't where they come from. It's why they run in the first place. 50 State Marathon Club:The rules (or some of them) The event shall have a minimum of 10 finishers It must have a minimum of 60 days' advanced publicity in a running publication, magazine, newspaper, website or race brochure The event must either start or finish in the state being counted. A marathon that runs into two states counts as one In 1997, Paula Boone was a marathon novice. She ran her first, in her home state of Utah, a year earlier while ""getting in shape after having my two kids"". But after meeting Steve the pace picked up. By 2003, she too had run a marathon in all 50 states. She now has 330 marathons in total, including at least four in each state. ""Steve was a really bad influence,"" she says. Paula - who's 51 and lives with her husband in Humble, Texas - says she isn't an elite athlete. Her last marathon took seven hours, although she ran her first in three hours and 59 minutes. So if she's not breaking records, or winning races, why does she keep going - step after step, state after state, more than 8,000 miles and counting? ""The actual running is really difficult,"" she says. ""But I love to travel, that's my favourite thing to do. It's really the best way to see the country."" For example - one race took Paula to Minot, North Dakota, a town that's not in many travel brochures. ""The middle of nowhere in the middle of nowhere,"" she says. Jody Reed and her running partner, Sydney There's also the social side. Jody Reed, a 58-year-old lawyer from Ashburn, Virginia, ran her first marathon in 1987 and has now done 152 - including at least one in every state. ""At this point, it's the friends [that keep me going],"" she says, speaking from Milwaukee where she's about to run another race. ""I'm here with a friend who I met last fall. We've done several races together since then. ""It would be a very unusual marathon where I'm not with people I know. And not just people I know - friends."" But while camaraderie is important, Paula thinks there's a deeper reason why people run. ""Most of us have pretty cushy jobs,"" she says. ""We're not out there sweating, and as humans we like to have some sort of striving, some kind of drive. ""The marathon fulfils that. We want to work towards some kind of goal; [to have] some kind of stress and strain."" So running marathons is a counterforce to the comfort of modern life? This video can not be played London Marathon: An inspirational end to the Marathon for two runners ""I think so,"" says Paula. ""The people who join our club are from every walk of life - people who are very poor, people who are very rich, and everything in between. The one thing that ties everybody together is they all strive. They are all self-driven. ""The mountains have all been climbed, everything has been discovered, but this is manageable - while being out of your comfort zone."" The man who catches marathon cheats Ross Brennan, a 57-year-old from Washington, DC, ran his first marathon in 1990. Back then, he says, marathon running ""was just becoming a thing - it was still a little bit exotic"". Now, marathons are certainly a thing. During the weekend of October 21-22, at least 26 cities in the US and Canada will host one according to marathonguide.com. There are 15 the weekend after and 24 the weekend after that. There are a number of reasons for that, says Ross. More people keep fit; the internet makes it easier to find races; and technology has made running ""less boring"". ""You can nerd-out on the IT stuff,"" he says. ""There are heart rate monitors, you can listen to tunes. In the 80s you couldn't do that."" And, like Paula, Ross thinks modern life makes marathons more appealing. ""From time to time, it's kind of primal,"" he says. ""It's me and a pair of shoes, I'm not thinking about work, I'm not doing a PowerPoint presentation, and I've still got it. ""You can think 'my job sucks, I feel like crap, I'm getting old' but once in a while you show up and still do 26 goddamn miles."" Ross Brennan: a self-confessed 'total geography nerd' But - while that may explain running marathons - it doesn't explain doing one in every state. ""Oh, I'm a total geography nerd,"" admits Ross. ""I love travelling in the US. It's so heart-warming to turn up in a small town. The whole place welcomes you and it's wonderful. ""There are banners, free ice creams at the ice cream parlour, a party in the city park... I need that reality check. It's so much part of why I do it."" American cricket gets ready for take-off The man with 7,000 licence plates At first, Ross didn't realise he was collecting states. He ran on holiday. He ran during work trips. But it was only when looking at his spreadsheet - all runners have a spreadsheet, it seems - he noticed he was covering the country, slowly but sorely. Ross was helped by the rise of ""series marathons"", when races are organised back-to-back over a week or so - often for people who want to complete all 50 states. ""The most I did was five in a week,"" he says. ""It was the Riverboat Series - Kentucky, Tennessee, Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, I think - four of which I hadn't done before."" Ross told his wife he wanted to run in 50 states only three years ago. ""I did it in quite a subtle way,"" he says. ""It was like: 'Here's this thing I'm doing...'"" But when he flew to Hawaii to complete the set, his family came to watch him cross the line. The date was 26 June 2016; his time was just under five hours. A journey that began 26 years earlier, 5,000 miles east, had ended. He has now run 71 marathons and there are no plans to stop. ""Even if I'm not planning to run, I'll log onto Marathon Guide and see what's out there."" While that may be ""eccentric"", as Ross says, it's nothing compared to some members of the 50 State Marathons Club. ""I remember being on a shuttle bus in a race in Montana, or somewhere,"" says Ross. ""This guy said to me 'It's number 11.' ""I said 'Cool - are you going to do all 50 states?' He replied 'No - I've done all 50 states. This is the 11th time round.'"" Inspirational end to London Marathon for two runners.

Turning a nightmare into pop music,"This video can not be played Everything Everything perform Can't Do at BBC Music Introducing Live 2017 ""There's a tide and it's coming in now,"" sings Jonathan Higgs onNight Of The Long Knives,external, the latest single from Everything Everything. The title refers to Hitler's bloody purge of the Nazi party in 1934, drawing a parallel to the rise of the right-wing politics in the last two years. Only Higgs isn't convinced that fascism will sweep everything in its path. ""They're saying it's a wave but it feels like a dribbling mouth,"" he sneers in the single, questioning whether the alt-right are a powerful force, or just a bunch of idiots. ""And the answer is both,"" says the singer, sitting down to discuss the album with BBC News at the Brixton Academy. ""It depends how we react to it. If everyone [panics and] says, 'Oh God!' the next thing you know, they're the prime minister. ""But if you go, 'Ha, ha, ha, you're idiots,' well... they'll probably still become prime minister. But you have to keep your head about it."" It's surprising to hear Higgs make a plea for perspective. After all, this is a man whose last album, Get To Heaven, was a ""wretched and anxious"" response to Islamic State militants, beheadings, mass shootings and political corruption. ""I was in a dark place,""he told the BBCon its release. ""I was essentially trying to inhabit the minds of the [extremists] and that's a really horrible thing to face."" Everything Everything's new album dials back on the paranoia and dread - partly because Higgs thinks the world has caught up with him. ""I'm not less in that headspace, but I think everyone else is in it more,"" he says. ""But the album's a bit more abstract, a bit more personal. Away from politics and all that stuff, it's about the human relationships we all have."" The album is called A Fever Dream, a reference to the ""surreal, nightmarish things happening, day after day"" - especially the absurdity of modern politics. It's there in Big Game, a pomposity-pricking parable about Donald Trump (""Even little children see through you""), and it's there in Run the Numbers, a song that explores Michael Gove's comment that ""people in this country have had enough of experts,external"". ""Is it the first song to be inspired by Michael Gove? Yes, and it should be the only one. Let's leave it at that."" A Fever Dream reached number five when it was released in August - the band's best chart position to date Higgs is smart enough to be aware that he comes from a position of privilege, and his liberal views are out of step with the prevailing political climate. There's a song on the album calledIvory Tower,external, where people threaten to ""come and crush me in the Waitrose aisle"". On thetitle track,external, he sings: ""I hate the neighbours, they hate me too / The fear and the fury make me feel good."" ""It's admitting that I sort of enjoy arguing,"" he explains. ""I think we all do on some level. It's certainly popular."" ""With anonymity you can go much further than you ever could in real life,"" Higgs continues. ""People become very extreme very quickly. It feels good to give yourself over to that emotion."" This leads to a discussion of thefake news storiesthat spread in the wake of this month's mass shooting in Las Vegas. Everything Everything are named after the first two words on Radiohead's Kid A album ""I just can't begin to find a way into that mindset,"" says Higgs. ""But the whole idea about what's true has been thrown up in the air: Who do we trust? Why do we trust our journalists? Is it just because we're used to it?"" ""There are codes of practices in place, right?"" interjects his bandmate, Jeremy Pritchard. ""But does the Daily Mail care? Does Fox News care? I don't think so."" Higgs says keeping up with the news ""feels like a bad dream - sometimes it's scary and frightening and sometimes it's electrifying and exciting"". He adds: ""That's why there's a reference to being asleep or dreaming or waking up in every single song. There's a feeling of 'is it real, or is it not?'"" If this all sounds pretty heavy, it's worth noting that Everything Everything have always dressed up their angst in a cathartic explosion of melodic pop. That's how they sneak songs likeCough Cough,external(about greed for oil),My Kz Ur Bf,external(airstrikes) and Night Of The Long Knives onto daytime radio. ""Musically, A Fever Dream's a bit more electronic but also heavier with guitars and riffs,"" says Pritchard (second left) In concert, this results in fans bellowing out the lyrics toNo Reptiles,external- a song about feeling passive and useless and alienated from society. There's something bizarre, I observe, about hearing 3,000 people chanting: ""It's alright to feel like a fat child in a pushchair."" ""You're telling me,"" laughs Higgs. ""We're always surprised by what people's favourites are,"" adds Pritchard. ""And we're still towards the beginning of that process on this album. ""We've written them, we've recorded them and now we're seeing what works in the live arena - where the energy is, how to play it."" But the ""fat child in a pushchair"" remains the bassist's favourite part of the set, every night. ""I don't have to play anything at that point in the song,"" he says, ""So I always take my earphones out and listen to the crowd. It's incredible."" A Fever Dream is out now.

How tribesmen took on a maharaja's army,"A view of Muzaffarabad, where the Neelum River divides the main city from hillside settlements Towering some 550 metres (1,800 ft) above the Pakistani town of Garhi Habibullah to the west, and the Kashmiri city of Muzaffarabad to the east, Dub Gali looks serene on a cool October morning. Some two dozen shops sit quietly on both sides of a security barrier that marks the border between Kashmir and the Pakistani province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. There is nothing to suggest that hordes of militant Pathan tribal warriors who invaded Kashmir exactly 70 years ago to start one of the world's most enduring territorial conflicts actually broke into the region through this very point. But a local villager, Mohammad Hasan Qureshi, 86, clearly remembers those stormy days. ""A week before the Pathans came, there were rumours that Kashmiri Sikhs [who had a significant population in this area] were planning to attack Muzaffarabad,"" he says. ""A couple of days later, we heard that Pathans were coming."" Mohammad Hasan Qureshi says he saw hundreds of Pathans with axes and swords Such rumours were natural, coming as they did amid a series of upheavals that shook the princely state of Kashmir when the so-called 3 June Plan was announced. Under the plan, British India, a Hindu-majority colony, was to be partitioned to create the Muslim state of Pakistan. The fate of Kashmir, a princely state with a Muslim majority but a Hindu ruler, hung in the balance. Muslims in the western districts of the state revolted against the ruling maharaja in June and there were anti-Muslim riots in southern Kashmir in September. There were also reports of a leaked Pakistani plan for raising a tribal column of 20,000 fighters to attack and annex Kashmir. Mr Qureshi remembers the evening of 21 October, when he and some friends climbed a ridge to have a view of the western valley. They saw trucks carrying Pathans drive down the Batrasi hills into Garhi Habibullah. ""We stayed up all night, waiting. They came in the morning - just before daybreak. There were hundreds of them. Most of them carried axes and swords. Some had muskets, others just sticks. The Maharaja's guards at the barrier had vanished."" First clashes took place on their way down to Muzaffarabad, some 8km (5 miles) of steep descent. This 1947 picture shows Pathan tribesmen waiting for trucks and more ammunition as they prepare to go into battle Gohar Rahman, a World War Two veteran from Battagram, 80km north-west of Garhi Habibullah, was in the column that crossed from Dub Gali. ""We knew the area so we led one group through this shorter route, on foot,"" he says. ""The bulk of the Frontier tribesmen - Wazir, Mahsud, Turi, Afridi, Mohmand, the Malakand Yusufzais - went via the longer but easier Lohar Gali route in lorries and trucks."" Around 2,000 tribesmen stormed Muzaffarabad that morning and easily scattered the Kashmir state army deployed there. Military historians estimate it was just 500-strong at the time and had also suffered defections by Muslim soldiers. Perhaps the biggest movement of people in history, outside war and famine. Two newly independent states were created - India and Pakistan. About 12 million people became refugees. Between half a million and a million people were killed in religious violence. Tens of thousands of women were abducted.

""They plundered the state armoury, set entire markets on fire and looted their goods,"" Mr Rahman says. ""They shot everyone who couldn't recite the kalima - the Arabic-language Muslim declaration of faith. Many non-Muslim women were enslaved, while many others jumped in the river to escape capture."" The streets were littered with signs of mayhem - broken buildings, broken shop furniture, the ashes of burnt goods and dead bodies, including those of tribal fighters, state soldiers and local men and women. There were also bodies floating in the river. The raiders spent about three days in Muzaffarabad before sense prevailed and the leaders urged them to move on towards Srinagar, the state capital some 170km to the east. From here, one column drove in trucks down the Jhelum river, breezing past Uri and reaching Baramulla where another round of looting and arson ensued. Gohar Rahman says the tribesmen shot non-Muslims when they stormed Muzaffarabad Mr Rahman was part of the column that headed north on foot to Teetwal from where they turned east and went past Kupwara to arrive at the outskirts of Srinagar, a journey of well over 200km. They did not face any resistance. The maharaja's army had scattered, and Hindus and Sikhs had fled the villages. They only met Muslims on the way. ""Muslim women would sometimes offer us food but the Pathans were reluctant to accept, thinking it may be poisoned. They would instead capture those people's goats and sheep, slaughter them and roast the meat on fire."" One night the fires attracted aircraft that dropped bombs, killing scores of them. ""Bodies were strewn over a large area in a forest."" Unbeknown to them, the maharaja had by then signed an instrument of accession with India. Between 26 and 30 October, the Indians flew in enough troops to Srinagar to tilt the balance against tribal fighters. The tribesmen still had numerical superiority but they were more adept at guerrilla war than infantry-style battles. At that point, Pakistan's attempt to launch a formal attack on Srinagar in aid of the tribesmen was frustrated due to opposition from the British joint command of the as-yet-undivided militaries of India and Pakistan. By November's end, the tribesmen had mostly pulled back to Uri, where the Jhelum gorge becomes narrower and easy to defend. Soon the winter snows arrived and put an end to the Indian advance towards Muzaffarabad. It was here that the line that divides Kashmir between the Indian and Pakistani parts stabilised. Pakistani forces formally arrived on the scene in the spring of 1948 to reinforce this border. What is Kashmir like? A country divided: How partition affected me When teens from Kashmir and Delhi became pen pals Hussain Gul, a resident of Shalozan village in the Kurram tribal region who was then a soldier of the paramilitary Kurram Militia, was part of that force. ""We were there to attack and recapture [the 2,800-metre] Pandu ridge which the Indians had occupied during autumn,"" he says. ""It was a good victory. We were able to occupy a considerable part of Kashmir but we still lost most of it. It made one feel sad, like when you lose a part of your house,"" His father, who went in with a band of friends to fight during the previous season, ""came back defeated"". ""They brought back war booty though; gold and some women,"" he chuckles. Hussain Gul holds the rifle he used in the battle for Pandu ridge The picture on Mr Gul's Kurram Militia ID In his mid-90s now, and with a fading memory, he is not sure what happened to the women. As for gold, ""they were cheated out of it by Majoor"", an ethnic Hazara businessman in Parachinar, the central town of Kurram. Gohar Rahman returned to Garhi Habibullah when the first winter snows came. With him were many other tribesmen. ""They had returned with war booty,"" he says. ""Some had brought cattle, some horses. Most of them had brought arms, and many brought women. One Afridi tribesman walked back with two women in tow. They wept incessantly and just wouldn't stop. A local feudal lord took pity on them and forced the Afridi man to release them."" The invasion not only traumatised a previously well-settled and peaceful Kashmiri society, it also set a disastrous pattern for India-Pakistan relations. Is India losing Kashmir? The stolen childhoods of Kashmir in pencil and crayon The shopkeeper who lived through Kashmir's wars Major-General Akbar Khan, an army officer who is widely believed to have played a pivotal role in starting the invasion, emerged as ""the architect of (the) philosophy of armed insurrection by aiding non-state actors as state proxies"", writes a military historian, Major (Retd) Agha Humayun Amin, in his book , The 1947-48 Kashmir War: The War of Lost Opportunities. Pakistanrepeated this strategy in Kashmir in 1965, during the Kashmir insurgency of 1988-2003, as well as in the Kargil War of 1999. It also used non-state actors in Afghanistan. But instead of liberating Kashmir or taming Afghanistan, it has led to the weakening of political processes, and has militarised society not only in Kashmir and Afghanistan, but also in Pakistan. 3 June 1947:The June Plan, also called the Mountbatten Plan, is approved in a meeting.

Will Australia's 'miracle economy' keep on winning?,"It was the year Australia went to war in the Gulf, when Monica Seles and Boris Becker won tennis grand slams in Melbourne, and The Simpsons was first shown on Aussie television, while a swooning Bryan Adams was a hit with love-struck teenagers (""Look into your heart, baby""). It was 1991, and the last time Australia tasted the bitter economic taste of recession, defined in these parts, at least, as two or more back-to-back quarters of negative growth in real gross domestic product, or the value of all services and goods. Since then, Australia has sidestepped the worst effects of the Asian financial crisis in 1997 and its more destructive big brother that hammered global markets a decade or so later. Australia's economy - the ""wonder down under"" - has somehow dodged the unstoppable forces that sent other wealthy countries tumbling into reverse. Australia experiences slowest quarterly growth in five years Australia's child poverty 'national shame' When bad news about Australia's economy hits home When a slump hits a vast iron ore mine in Australia For this, a nation of 24 million people must thank not only sound judgement by those in charge but also good fortune, according to Shane Oliver, chief economist at financial services company AMP in Sydney. ""I certainly don't see Australia as being a miracle,"" he says.  ""It has had a bit of good luck and good management, but it would be dangerous to assume that it is never going to have a recession again."" Coal production helped the Australian economy stay afloat The economy is growing by about 1.9% per year, according to the Reserve Bank. In 2012, that figure was 3.7%.  Weaker growth means that pay packets are shrinking for many workers when adjusted for the rising cost of living, and near-record levels of underemployment are stifling wage increases. In August, retail sales posted their biggest retreat in about four-and-a-half years, falling by 0.6%, with cafes and restaurants reporting declining turnovers. Rocks, coal and demand from China insulated this country from the global financial meltdown in 2008, as a red-hot mining industry delivered unprecedented wealth. Surging commodity prices fuelled the bonanza in Western Australia and Queensland, which propped up under-performing states in the south-east, where most Australians live. Shane Oliver says the situation has now ""been turned on its head"" and Australia is once again in transition. The mining boom has faded, but areas that once struggled have bounced back in part because of record low interest rates that have unleashed a frenzy into the housing market. Meanwhile, eye-watering wads of public money have poured into infrastructure projects, which are redefining parts of New South Wales, the most populous state. There was another critical factor that helped Australia to largely avoid the ravages of the global financial crisis - unprecedented spending by the Labor government that boosted public expenditure by a whopping 13% in an attempt to stimulate growth. It was a classic Keynesian economic manoeuvre to use billions of dollars to sustain household spending, demand and employment. Australia loves to win. Here international cricket matches are akin to ""wars"" and Olympic gold medals - or a lack thereof - are greeted with congratulatory back-slapping - or hand-wringing. If there was a podium for economic success, this is a country that would be bending forward to accept the award. More than 25 years of uninterrupted growth is a remarkable achievement, although there is debate about the competition. Australian economy has been recession-free for 25 years Some commentators believe the recent economic prosperity enjoyed by the Netherlands lasted for (only) 22 years, putting it firmly into silver medal position behind the Aussies. Tim Harcourt, an economics fellow at the University of New South Wales, believes Australia deserves the plaudits. ""This time the 'lucky country' made its own luck. ""The Hawke-Keating [government] reforms of the 1980s and 1990s - the currency float, tariff changes, and embrace of Asia - set up us up for a quarter of a century of growth. ""Australia found itself in the right place at the right time and embraced the Asia century,"" he argues. But as the economy has soared,  some Australians have been left behind.  At almost 13%, youth unemployment is more than twice the national average. Labouring work had left 21-year-old Mohammad Al-Khafaji, the son of an Iranian refugee, with endless back pain and homelessness soon followed. ""I was just trying to apply for jobs online, and then people were just putting me down saying 'you are never going to get that job', so I just stopped trying,"" he says. Mohammad is now employed by a hire car company in Sydney, and has ambitions to one day be the boss. He works with Shiv Dhingra, an Indian migrant from Punjab. They are proof that much of Australia's economic might is down to immigration. ""I am the only one working in my family,"" Shiv explained.  ""I am the main financial support they have.  I am working seven days a week for the last year. I've got plans for my own business."" Charity Bounce runs sessions in partnership with professional athletes Both young men were helped by Charity Bounce, a Sydney-based non-profit organisation that uses basketball to reach out to the disadvantaged and long-term unemployed, who, according to chief executive, Ian Heininger, also deserve a slice of Australia's prosperity. ""We find a lot of the young people are desperate to find work,"" he says, ""desperate to find an opportunity that is going to get them into a place where they are contributing back to the world."" But will they be part of an ever-expanding economy? Mr Oliver thinks Australia's luck will eventually run out, but not for a while. ""The Aussie economy is probably going to continue muddling along, not fantastically strong as housing slows and consumer spending remains a bit weak,"" he predicts. ""We are probably going to go for at least another few years before we have that recession some people say is inevitable.""

Wim Wenders puts the snap back into Polaroid,"Wim Wenders chose himself as a subject for some of his photos Wim Wenders became a major film-maker when, in the 1970s, German cinema became cool around the world.  His hits included The American Friend and Paris, Texas.  But Wenders was privately experimenting with one of the most straightforward of visual technologies - the Polaroid stills camera.  Thousands of those shots were thrown away - but now a selection of surviving images has gone on display in London. Wenders says when he started taking Polaroid pictures in the mid-1960s it had nothing to do with art. Wim Wenders says taking snaps was useful to his film-making and it was fun ""It was just part of my life.  I would photograph things to do with movies I was making, or when I travelled.  It was useful and fun - which I think is what Polaroids were for most people."" Instant photography - doing away with a separate and lengthy process of developing film outside the camera - arrived commercially in 1948. It was the creation of Polaroid's founder Edwin Land.  In the early years the images were black and white. The big step forward was the arrival of the Polaroid sx-70 camera in the early 1970s. ""It was science fiction and nobody had seen anything like it. You pointed the camera and took the picture and then it came out - an empty, blank bit of white paper. ""And before your eyes it slowly turned into the image you had shot a few moments before.  It was exhilarating in its colours and brightness. New York is given the Wim Wenders treatment ""You have to remember that at this time people didn't have even VHS tape - we were in a simpler, analogue world.  So to be able to create and record a visual image almost immediately seemed extraordinary."" Now some 200 of the images are on display in London, under the title Instant Stories. Some of them show well-known people the director worked with such as the actor Dennis Hopper. Others are landscapes or pictures of odd corners in places Wenders visited such as New York or Sydney. There are also close-up images of a TV set showing the 1956 film The Girl Can't Help It, with appearances from Eddie Cochrane and Gene Vincent. ""It's still my favourite rock and roll movie.  And suddenly with a Polaroid you could photograph something you enjoyed and you had it in front of you to hold, almost at once. At the time it was extraordinary. ""The other great thing is that if friends were in the image you could give it to them - and that's what happened to many of the pictures I took. ""I'd had traditional cameras since I was six or so and I enjoyed using them. But there was a whole new spontaneity with the Polaroid which I think some people are now starting to rediscover the way they've rediscovered music on vinyl. ""Everyone says, 'oh the kids aren't interested in physical objects any more: they don't want a book or a newspaper or a CD.' ""But the kids will regret it when they're older: if you're 25 you have to realise that the phone which seems so great now will one day be yesterday's technology and lots of the digital images we all have will be hard or even impossible to look at."" Dennis Hopper invented the selfie in the Wenders movie The American Friend, says the director But doesn't a modern smartphone produce images far more sophisticated than any Polaroid camera did 40 years ago? Wenders says the basic character of the technology was part of the appeal. ""I think people who look at the images will find a sort of beauty here. The colours the process produced are great, though the monochrome images are attractive too."" The director points out a particular black and white picture. ""It's the Hoboken Terminal in New York and I was shooting a film 30 years ago there called Lightning Over Water.  These places are mainly gone."" For a long time the pictures just went up on Wenders' refrigerator and then were stored away in cigar boxes. ""But they remain unique: they only existed once and there's no negative and you can't duplicate it. Forty years later they seem quite precious."" Wenders remembers that at the time a new Polaroid model or a big technical development was the equivalent of an Apple launch today. ""So when the sx-70 came out we were delighted to get hold of it early to use in the film Alice in the Cities (1974)."" The new show in London plays on a loop the scene from The American Friend in which, says Wenders, ""Dennis Hopper invents the selfie with a Polaroid camera."" There was something ""sacred"" about the instantaneity of the Polaroid, says Wenders There was also a use behind the camera.  ""So at this time there's no video playout and you only see your rushes three days later.  The Polaroid camera can be a real help setting up a shot."" But in the 1980s Wenders abandoned Polaroids entirely.  ""I was starting to take stills photography more seriously and I started to use large-size cameras"". But he retained one of his old Polaroid cameras and only recently gave it to Patti Smith to replace one she was having problems with. Wenders thinks digital photography is now so problem-free and so cheap that a lot of the creativity has gone. ""It's so easy for a professional photographer to take hundreds or even thousands of pictures of a particular face or of a scene and of course a few of them will be good and the rest are wiped.  It can be an impersonal, industrial process. ""The Polaroid was instant but it was still connected to the original idea of photography.  There was always something sacred about the act of stealing an image from the world."" Instant Stories: Wim Wenders' Polaroids is at the Photographers' Gallery in London until 11 February 2018.

Reality Check: Why Brexit transition may not buy time,"This video can not be played David Davis updates Parliament on Brexit talks So the focus of the Brexit talks has shifted slightly as a result of the EU leaders' summit in Brussels. There is still plenty of tough bargaining ahead in the next few weeks, especially on the question of money. But there is also going to be more and more talk about preparing for a transition period - for what happens immediately after the UK leaves the EU in March 2019. Plenty of people see transition as a way to buy a little more time to sort things out - to finalise negotiations on a future trade deal. But the UK government prefers to calls the transition phase a ""period of implementation"". It is not entirely clear what would be implemented. But the Brexit Secretary David Davis warned this week that without a final deal on a future partnership with the EU - at least in principle - the government would not want to trigger any kind of transition at all. Does it mean the two sides view the prospects for transition very differently? How are the Brexit talks progressing? The EU27 - the other member states without the UK - have now agreed to start working on new guidelines for their negotiators. And both the EU and Theresa May (in herFlorence speech) have said that any transition/implementation period would take place under ""the existing structure of EU rules and regulations"". There will be plenty of technical challenges: what happens, for example, to the UK's role in EU trade agreements with third countries? Those third countries might have their own opinions about that. But there is also the question of what happens during a transition period itself? It could mean roughly two more years to continue negotiations on the details of a future partnership with the EU on trade, security and a host of other issues. TheConfederation of British Industry,external, for example, argues that in order to avoid a ""cliff-edge"" Brexit, negotiations on a trading agreement should continue during a transition. But UK government policy is rather different. It still argues that a deal on our ""final relationship"" with the rest of the EU can be completed before the UK leaves the EU at the end of March 2019. Most observers are convinced that, for practical reasons, that will not be possible - there is simply too much to do. But Mr Davis insisted in the House of Commons this week that if the broad outlines of a permanent deal are not in place when the UK leaves, a transition period will not be triggered. Asked by Conservative MP Rishi Sunak for reassurance that ""what is meant to be a transitory state of affairs does not become a permanent bridge to nowhere"", Mr Davis said: ""We will try to get the nature of the implementation phase agreed as soon as possible, so that businesses can take that into account."" He added: ""But he's right that such a transition phase would only be triggered once we've completed the deal itself, we cannot carry on negotiating through that - our negotiating position during the transition phase would not be very strong."" In other words, Mr Davis is saying - in stronger language than the government appears to have used before - that if there is no final deal by March 2019, at least in principle, then the UK would not want to trigger a transition period. The words ""at least in principle"" contain a fair amount of wiggle room. And the EU itself would be delighted if the outlines of a future agreement could be agreed so quickly. It says only that a withdrawal agreement (as opposed to a future trade agreement) has to be finalised in order for there to be a transition. And Article 50 simply says the withdrawal agreement must ""take account of the framework for a future relationship"". But Mr Davis appears to be upping the ante. ""No final deal"" equals ""no transition"" equals ""hard Brexit"". As a negotiating tactic, it may be designed to keep the pressure on. But it may not be what many business leaders want to hear.

Labour: UK heading for no Brexit deal,"This video can not be played Emily Thornberry: ""I think we are heading for no-deal Brexit"" Brexit negotiations with the EU are heading for a ""no deal"" scenario, Labour's Emily Thornberry has warned. Shadow foreign secretary Ms Thornberry said the PM's failure to control her party was causing ""intransigence"" on the UK side, which was a ""serious threat to Britain"" and its interests. But International Trade Secretary Liam Fox said a failure to agree a deal was ""not exactly a nightmare scenario"". The UK was preparing ""mitigation"" measures for such an outcome, he said. Meanwhile, theSpanish foreign minister said the lives of UK expats in Spainwould not be ""disrupted"" - even if no Brexit deal is agreed. Labour demands changes to Brexit repeal bill Brexit: Why a transition period may not buy time What would 'no deal' look like? Theresa May will update MPs on Monday on the progress made at last week's Brussels summit, where EU leaders agreed to begin scoping work on future trade talks while asking for more concessions from the UK on the opening phase of negotiations. These talks, covering the UK's ""divorce bill"", the rights of expats after Brexit and the border in Northern Ireland, have failed to reach agreement so far - leading to a focus on what happens if nothing is put in place by the time the UK leaves the European Union in March 2019. Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, Ms Thornberry said: ""I think what we may be seeing is the Europeans trying to make it clear that it is not their fault that there are these difficulties - the intransigence does not come from their side, it comes from Theresa May's side. ""And in the end I think the reality is the intransigence is on Theresa May's side, because she doesn't have the strength or the authority to be able to control her backbenchers, let alone her cabinet. And I think we are heading for no deal, and I think that that is a serious threat to Britain and it is not in Britain's interests for that to happen. ""We will stop that."" This video can not be played Three key points about how the Brexit talks are going Labour is seeking to work with Tory rebelsto amend a key plank of Brexit legislation- the EU Withdrawal Bill - so that Parliament has the power to reject whatever the outcome of the negotiations turns out to be. Following last week's summit, European Council President Donald Tusk said that although not enough progress had been made to begin trade talks, reports of deadlock may have been exaggerated. French President Emmanuel Macron said there was still much work to be done on the financial commitment before trade talks can begin, adding: ""We are not halfway there."" Speaking on ITV's Peston on Sunday, Mr Fox said a final figure for the UK's financial settlement with the EU cannot come ""until we know what the final package looks like"", later in the negotiation process. He also dismissed President Macron's suggestion that ""secondary players"" in the UK were ""bluffing"" about the possibility of a no deal outcome, saying this was ""completely wrong"". Mr Fox, who is responsible for striking global trade deals after Brexit, said he would prefer a ""comprehensive"" arrangement to be agreed - but was ""not scared"" of what would happen if this was not possible. And he said trade talks would only be complicated if the ""European elite"" tried to ""punish Britain for having the audacity to use our legal rights to leave the European Union"". He said he hoped ""economic sense"" would prevail, as opposed to the ""near-theological"" pursuit of closer EU integration. When she addresses MPs on Monday, Mrs May is expected to reaffirm her commitment to EU nationals living in the UK, saying she will ""put people first"" in the ""deeply technical"" talks. Speaking on the Marr show, Spanish Foreign Minister Alfonso Dastis said expats would be allowed to continue living in Spain even if no Brexit deal was reached. ""I do hope that there will be a deal,"" he said. ""If there is no deal we will make sure that the lives of ordinary people who are in Spain, the UK people, is not disrupted. ""As you know, the relationship between the UK and Spain is a very close one in terms of economic relations and also social exchanges. ""Over 17 million Brits come to Spain every year and many of them live here or retire here, and we want to keep it that way as much as possible.""

Toddler dies in sixth-floor window fall,"A woman has been arrested on suspicion of murdering an 18-month-old boy who fell from a sixth-floor flat window. It ""quickly became apparent"" the boy had died when police were called to Newcastle House in Barkerend Road, Bradford, at 17:10 BST on Saturday. A 23-year-old woman arrested on suspicion of murder is receiving medical assessment in custody. One woman told how she, her husband and a friend tried to save the child, who was naked when he fell. Danuta Tomaszewicz, 59, said she had been on her phone, looking out of the window from a first-floor flat when she suddenly noticed the child on the ground below. She thought the child was a doll at first, she said. Her niece, Monika Tomaszewicz, said: ""She screamed for help and her husband and his friend ran downstairs. ""The friend took his shirt off because the baby was naked."" She said the ambulance arrived after about 20 minutes. Mrs Tomaszewicz's niece added: ""She could not sleep at all last night. ""She doesn't know how she is going to live here as every time she looks out of the window she will see the baby. ""They tried their best for the baby."" Andrew White, 53, said he lived on the same landing as the flat where the baby fell. He said a couple with two young children live there. Mr White, a father-of-three with four grandchildren, said: ""They are a nice young couple who keep themselves to themselves which is normal here."" West Yorkshire Police said it was an ""extremely traumatic incident"". Det Supt Nick Wallen said: ""Specially trained officers are working to support the child's family members and those who witnessed what took place. ""It is no exaggeration to say those who witnessed this incident will have been deeply traumatised by what they saw."" Police said they were not looking for anyone else in connection with the death. Newcastle House, which is in the city centre, is a seven-storey block of flats with shops on the ground floor. An unnamed resident, who lives on the same landing where the boy had fallen from, said: ""There's quite a high turnover of people in these flats, you wouldn't necessarily know your neighbours. I just keep to myself."" He said there were people of different nationalities living in the block. The resident said he saw police activity in the flats on Saturday night but only discovered what happened the next morning by watching the news. ""It's horrible,"" he said. ""It's hard to take.""

Fox kept O'Reilly despite harassment suit,"O'Reilly is known to have settled at least six sexual harassment suits Former Fox News commentator Bill O'Reilly was handed a new contract in January, despite  the network's parent company knowing he had recently settled a sexual harassment case. The $32m (Â£24m) settlement was paid to former Fox legal analyst Lis Wiehl, according to the New York Times. In a statement, parent company 21st Century Fox said was aware of the settlement, but not the sum, when it signed a $25m-a-year contract renewal. O'Reilly has denied any wrongdoing. He wasforced to resign in Aprilfollowing a raft of sexual harassment allegations. The settlement with Wiehl - which was ""extraordinarily large"" for such cases,according to the Times,external- is one of six involving O'Reilly that are in the public domain, totalling $45m. Several of those suits also involved former Fox News chairman Roger Ailes, who stepped down in 2016 amid accusations of harassment. Wiehl had worked for Fox for 15 years at the time of the settlement with O'Reilly and appeared regularly on his show The O'Reilly Factor. She left at the time of the settlement. ""When the company renewed Bill O'Reilly's contract in February, it knew that a sexual harassment lawsuit had been threatened against him by Lis Wiehl, but was informed by Mr O'Reilly that he had settled the matter personally, on financial terms that he and Ms Wiehl had agreed were confidential and not disclosed to the company,"" 21st Century Fox said in a statement. The company signed a $25 million-per-year deal with the commentator, but added corporate protections against future allegations of harassment against him. O'Reilly denied the allegations to the New York Times. ""I have never mistreated anyone,"" he said, adding that he had resolved matters with Wiehl privately because he wanted to spare his children from controversy. The commentator was forced to resign in April after a string of smaller settlements was reported by the Times and advertisers pulled out of his programme. In a statement to Reuters, Mark Fabiani, a spokesman for O'Reilly, criticised the Times for printing ""leaked information... that is out of context, false, defamatory, and obviously designed to embarrass Bill O'Reilly and to keep him from competing in the marketplace"". He also denounced the newspaper for not printing what he said was an affidavit signed by Wiehl withdrawing her allegations following the settlement. The disclosure of the Wiehl settlement follows a string of sexual assault allegations against Hollywood film mogul Harvey Weinstein, including accusations of rape, that sparked a international conversation about harassment in the film industry and beyond. Weinstein, 65, who was sacked by his own production firm, The Weinstein Company, and suspended by the board of the Oscars, has denied having non-consensual sex with anyone.

Presidents gather for hurricane fundraiser,"The five living former US presidents have gathered for a concert in aid of victims of the hurricanes which ravaged the US this year. Barack Obama, George W Bush, Bill Clinton, George HW Bush and Jimmy Carter appeared in Texas on Saturday. The three Democrats and two Republicans came together behind The One America Appeal, set up to help those caught up in the devastating trails of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria. It has raised $31m (Â£23.5m) so far. Watch: Why Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico so hard Who cleans up after hurricanes? Irma: How dangerous is the devastating storm? The politicians launched the appeal in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey, which caused billions in damage after it made landfall in Texas in August. Lady Gaga gave a surprise performance However, it has since been expanded to include the communities in Florida, Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands which were hit by the storms which followed. ""As former presidents, we wanted to help our fellow Americans begin to recover,"" Mr Obama explained to concertgoers in a pre-recorded message. His immediate predecessor added: ""People are hurting down here but as one Texan put it, we've got more love in Texas than water."" All five presidents appeared on stage for the anthem, before taking their seats to watch acts including Lee Greenwood, who opened  with Proud to be an American, and Lady Gaga. The One America Appeal was launched after Hurricane Harvey They were not joined by sitting President Donald Trump, who sent a message ahead of the show praising their ""wonderful"" work and expressing his ""deep gratitude"".

Home-buying review to tackle gazumping,"Home-buying and selling in England and Wales could be ""faster and less stressful"" under plans to simplify sales and tackle gazumping. Communities Secretary Sajid Javid launched an eight-week review, saying he wanted to ""hear from the industry"" on how to streamline home-buying. Ways of locking in deals and stopping sellers accepting higher offers at the last minute will be considered. But Labour said the plans were ""feeble"" and ""smack of political diversion"". ""This is a government out of touch and out of ideas,"" said Shadow housing secretary John Healey. ""After seven years of failure, ministers still have no plan to fix the housing crisis."" Gazumping: your views Where can I afford to rent or buy? House prices: Have they actually gone up? The current 'call for evidence'  follows proposals announced this month to look atnew ways to protect leaseholders and tenants from ""rogue agents""- both part of a drive by Mr Javid to modernise and improve the housing market. Although a million homes are bought and sold in England every year, a quarter of sales fall through, wasting hundreds of millions of pounds. Gazumping - when a seller accepts a higher offer from a new buyer, having previously accepted a lower offer - is among the most contentious of house-buying practices. Ministers will look at schemes such as ""lock-in agreements"" as a means of building confidence in the housing chain, which often collapse leaving those involved disappointed and out of pocket. The review will also look at ways of speeding up the process of home-buying, and will consider how to advise home buyers and sellers so they are sale-ready. Mr Javid called on estate agents, mortgage lenders and solicitors to share their experiences of the housing market - in order to ""help save people money and time so they can focus on what matters - finding their dream home"". He said: ""Buying a home is one of life's largest investments, so if it goes wrong it can be costly. That's why we're determined to take action. ""We want to help everyone have a good quality home they can afford, and improving the process of buying and selling is part of delivering that. "" Alex Neill, of consumer magazine Which?, described the house-buying process as ""outdated and flawed"". ""Buying a home can be one of the most stressful experiences in life, with sales often taking too long or falling through, with some consumers losing substantial sums of money. ""The government must put consumers first, ensuring that estate agents deliver a better service for both home-buyers and sellers and that the conveyancing process is simplified."" Mark Hayward, of the National Association of Estate Agents Propertymark, agreed there was ""scope to improve the process for home buying and selling"". But the estate agent Robert Red from Wright Marshall estate agents said stopping gazumping was difficult to avoid because it was a legal obligation to pass on an offer to a client. ""No matter how distasteful I might find it, I have to, by law, report [an increased offer] to my client, and my client will make the decision about that offer, and I have to carry out their instructions via the legal process,"" he told BBC Radio 5 Live. In a government survey of more than 2,000 people who have bought or sold a home recently, nearly half (46%) of sellers had concerns about a buyer changing their mind after making an offer. The survey found a quarter (24%) of sellers said they would use a different estate agent if they had to go through the process again, while almost a third (32%) of sellers and 28% of buyers were dissatisfied with the other party's solicitor.

WHO 'rethinking' Mugabe's appointment,"Robert Mugabe is frequently taken to task over human rights abuses The new head of the World Health Organisation (WHO) is rethinking a plan to appoint Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe as a goodwill ambassador. Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus's original proposal sparked an outcry. He had previously praised Zimbabwe for its commitment to public health. But Mr Mugabe's critics say Zimbabwe's healthcare system has collapsed under his 30-year rule, with staff often going without pay while medicines are in short supply. Profile: Robert Mugabe Africa's 'medical tourist' presidents It led Zimbabwean human rights lawyer Doug Coltart totake to Twitter,externalto question how the WHO felt about having ""a Goodwill Ambassador who destroyed the health sector in his country"". Other social media users accused the president - who, at 93, has outlived his country's average life expectancy by more than three decades - of travelling abroad to receive his own medical treatment.

Meanwhile, the UK government described his selection as ""surprising and disappointing"" given his country's human rights record, and warned it could overshadow the WHO's work. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he ""thought it was a bad April Fool's joke"", while the US state department said it ""clearly contradicts the United Nations ideals of respect for human rights and human dignity"". Zimbabwe's leader has been frequently taken to task over human rights abuses by both the EU and the US. Critics have long argued that Zimbabwe's health service is not meeting the needs of patients Other groups who have criticised Mr Mugabe's appointment include the Wellcome Trust, the NCD Alliance, UN Watch, the World Heart Federation and Action Against Smoking. Dr Tedros had said Zimbabwe was a country that ""places universal health coverage and health promotion at the centre of its policies to provide health care to all"". However, the Ethiopian said on Saturday he was ""rethinking his approach in light of WHO values"". Mr Mugabe was supposed to be goodwill ambassador ""to help tackle non-communicable diseases"", which includes things like heart attacks and asthma. Dr Tedrosis the first African to lead the WHO.

Italian regions vote on more autonomy,"""Yes"" posters in the Veneto region Two of Italy's richest northern regions have voted for more autonomy, according to their leaders. More than 90% of voters in Lombardy, home to Italy's financial capital Milan, and the Veneto region around Venice, voted yes in the non-binding referendum, their presidents claimed. Both men are members of the Northern League, which has long argued that the north is subsidising the poorer south. The regions together account for about 30% of Italy's national wealth. Critics of the polls call them a stunt to bolster the right-wing Northern League before a general election next year, while the central government in Rome says the polls are unnecessary although they are permitted under the Italian constitution. They contrast sharply withthe crisis in Spainwhere one of the richest regions, Catalonia, held an referendum on independence on 1 October, despite the country's constitutional court ruling it illegal. In response, Spain's government plans to impose direct rule. Reality Check: Do referendums bring about change? Italy country profile But President Roberto Maroni, who leads Lombardy, where voter turnout was about 40%, has sought to distance the Italian vote from the situation in Spain. ""We are not Catalonia,"" he told Reuters news agency in Milan. Roberto Maroni is a leading member of the Northern League ""We remain inside the Italian nation with more autonomy while Catalonia wants to become the 29th state of the European Union. We, no. Not for now."" One of the regions' main complaints is that they send much more in taxes to Rome than they get back in public spending, and want to roughly halve their contribution. Lombardy, Mr Maroni says, annually pays out â¬54bn (Â£48bn; $64bn) more than it receives while for Veneto, where voter turnout was higher, at between 57% and 61%, this figure is said to be about â¬15.5bn. ""Our taxes should be spent here, not in Sicily,"" Giuseppe Colonna, 84, told AFP news agency in Venice. But critics object to millions of euros being spent on referendums when all regions already have the constitutional right to negotiate directly with Rome. ""Once you open up the issue of what the northern regions pay, then I expect a backlash in southern Italy,"" Giovanni Orsina, history professor at Rome's Luiss-Guido Carli University, told Reuters.

Universal credit wait time 'must be cut',"The six-week waiting time for universal credit must be cut as the idea that people have a nest egg to fall back on is ""grotesquely ignorant"", the Archbishop of York has said. Writing in The Sunday Times,external, Dr John Sentamu said ministers must take a ""courageous"" look at the benefit. Addressing the delay must be a priority, he said. The government said it was determined to ensure people would not face hardship. Changes recently announced to the system of advanced payments meant people could access these as soon as they got into the system, a spokesman said. What is universal credit? 'My five-year-old searched bins for food' Universal credit rolls six working-age benefits into a single payment. This video can not be played Holly Sargent has had to sell her possessions because of problems receiving universal credit Since it began rolling out four years ago, almost a quarter of the 610,000 claimants receiving the benefit have had to wait for a month and a half for the first payment. Although Dr Sentamu praised the concept of a single welfare payment, he wrote that the current system ""seems to assume that everyone has a nest egg that will tide them over as they wait a minimum of 42 days for payouts"". ""That assumption is grotesquely ignorant, because millions of people, especially those in need of support, are already in debt and have nothing to fall back on,"" he said. Dr Sentamu added that the UK's poorest were at risk of falling into a downward spiral of debt, with some taking out expensive loans to bridge the 42-day benefit gap, so that the repayment of loans or of interest ""becomes the first call on any payment they receive"". He wrote: ""In the Bible, the hardest-pressed of all poor people were summarised as 'widows and orphans' for they were the group most at risk and with least support. ""Our concern should be for their present-day successors whose essential outgoings are costing more and more and their incomes standing still or going down."" The Joseph Rowntree Foundation has warned that an additional 340,000 people will be in poverty by 2022 because of cuts implemented by former Chancellor George Osborne to the universal credit work allowance. The independent charity claimed that a lone parent working full-time on the national living wage will be Â£832 a year worse off because of the cut. The equivalent figure for couples with a single breadwinner working full-time is Â£468, it said. Last week, Prime Minister Theresa Mayagreed to scrap premium rate charges for phone calls to the universal credit helpline, which can be up to 55p a minute. However, she refused to pause the roll-out of the scheme despite a non-binding vote by the opposition backing the move. Tory MPs were ordered to abstain from voting. Stephen McPartland, a Conservative MP who threatened to rebel, told BBC Radio 4's Week at Westminster that he thought a resolution to the issue was close. He would like a reduction in the delay to four weeks and said: ""I think the Secretary of State [David Gauke] has found it very difficult to justify inside the parliamentary party why they need to defend a six-week wait.""

Labour 'could back Tory rebels on Brexit',"Sir Keir Starmer wants six changes to the government's repeal bill Labour will back Conservative rebels over Brexit unless the prime minister accepts changes to its repeal bill, the party's shadow Brexit secretary says. Sir Keir Starmer wants six changes to the bill, which aims to transfer EU legislation into British law. If these are not accepted Labour will back Tory rebels in an attempt to force a vote on the final EU deal, he said. The government said it would listen to MPs about possible improvements to the bill but would not let it be ""wrecked"". Reality Check: Why Brexit transition may not buy time Brexit deadlock talk 'exaggerated' - Tusk EU mood music improves on Brexit bargaining The loss of the government's Commons majority in the June general election means a relatively small revolt by Conservative MPs could derail the legislation. Hundreds of amendments to the bill have already been tabled by Tory rebels, as well as opposition MPs. Writing in the Sunday Times,external, Sir Keir said the government had withheld the legislation from the House of Commons for two weeks running because it fears defeat on at least 13 amendments at the hands of Tory rebels. He said it was ""clear"" that ministers could not proceed with the bill as it stands and threatened to ""work with all sides"" to get his changes made - unless ministers adopted them and end the ""paralysis"". Sir Keir demanded that: MPs get the ""final say on whether to approve the withdrawal agreement and how best to implement it"" The transition period requested by Prime Minister Theresa May is added into the legislation A ""completely different approach"" to the use of powers the government argues are needed to make technical changes to regulations from Brussels A guarantee that workers' and consumer rights, as well as environmental standards, are not watered down after Brexit A concession to devolved administrations who want repatriated powers that would normally fall under their remit to go straight to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, rather than the Westminster government first Putting the EU charter of fundamental rights into UK law The shadow Brexit secretary wrote: ""I believe there is a consensus in Parliament for these changes. ""And there is certainly no majority for weakening rights, silencing Parliament and sidelining the devolved administrations. ""There is a way through this paralysis. ""Labour will work with all sides to make that happen."" Theresa May is due to update the Commons on the progress made on Brexit at the European Council meeting Sir Keir's intervention comes days after EU leaders agreed to begin scoping work on trade talks. But they also made clear Britain must make further concessions on its divorce bill to unlock talks on a future trading relationship. Brexit Secretary David Davis will travel to Paris for Brexit talks on Monday after France appeared to emerge as the most hardline EU member state on the exit bill. The prime minister is due to update the Commons on Monday on the progress made during the summit on Thursday and Friday. Mrs May is expected to say that while negotiations on Brexit are ""deeply technical"" she has never forgotten that millions of people are at the heart of the process and they remain her ""first priority"". She will also say that the millions of European citizens living in the UK make an ""extraordinary contribution"" to our society and that ""we want them to stay"". A government spokesman said the repeal bill was ""essential"" to deliver on the result of the referendum while ensuring the maximum possible legal certainty for businesses and citizens. The UK is due to leave the EU in March 2019, following last year's referendum result.

Catalan leaders decry direct rule plan,"This video can not be played Some 450,000 people protested on Saturday, local police said The Catalan president, Carles Puigdemont, says the region will not accept Madrid's plan for direct rule. He described it as the worst attack on Catalonia's institutions since General Franco's 1939-1975 dictatorship, under which regional autonomy was dissolved. Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy's plans include the removal of Catalonia's leaders and curbs on its parliament. An independence referendum went ahead on 1 October, despite being banned by Spain's Constitutional Court. Reality Check: Would Catalonia be a viable country? Cases for and against independence The crisis in 300 words Mr Puigdemont said the Spanish government was acting against the democratic will of Catalans after refusing all offers of dialogue. This video can not be played Catalan president's message to Europe He said he would call for a session of the Catalan parliament to debate a response to Mr Rajoy's plans. Addressing European citizens in English, he added that the EU's founding values were ""at risk"" in Catalonia. Barcelona police said 450,000 people protested in the regional capital earlier on Saturday, with many chanting ""freedom"" and ""independence"". Mr Rajoy said he was triggering Article 155 of the constitution, which allows for direct rule to be imposed in a crisis on any of the country's autonomous regions. Speaking after an emergency cabinet meeting, Mr Rajoy stopped short of dissolving the region's parliament but put forward plans for elections. He insisted the measures would not mean Catalan self-government itself was being suspended. Instead, he said, the plan was to remove those people who had ""taken self-government outside the law and the constitution"". The measures, which are supported by opposition parties, must now be approved by the Senate in the next few days. Mr Rajoy said the government would apply Spain's Article 155 Reports say Spain's interior ministry is preparing to take control of Catalonia's Mossos d'Esquadra police force and remove its commander, Josep LluÃ­s Trapero, who is already facing sedition charges. The government is also considering taking control of Catalonia's public broadcaster TV3, El PaÃ­s newspaperreports (in Spanish),external. ""Return to the past"" is how Catalonia's Catalan-language, pro-independence El Punt Avui sums up Saturday's developments on its front page. Inan opinion piece,external, Xevi Xirgo argues that Madrid is mounting a ""coup d'etat"" to submit Catalonia to central rule in a way not seen since the 18th Century. Inan editorial in El PeriÃ³dico,external, Spain's fifth-biggest newspaper which publishes both in Spanish and Catalan, Enric HernÃ ndez argues that Madrid responded in kind to ""the aggression of the independence camp"", which ignored Spanish law to hold a ""sham referendum"". HernÃ ndez calls on Mr Puigdemont to agree to Mr Rajoy's call for early regional elections as the best way out of the crisis or else face a ""social revolt with unforeseeable consequences"". Meanwhile El PaÃ­s, Spain's biggest paper, a left-of-centre daily, endorses the government inan editorial entitled ""The democratic state responds"",externaland declares that Mr Rajoy is acting to ""restore constitutional legality in Catalonia"". ""Democracy not only has the right to defend itself but a duty to do so,"" it says. The use of Article 155 has sparked widespread criticism in Catalonia, where many say it amounts to a suspension of the region's powers of self-government. The Speaker of the Catalan Parliament, Carme Forcadell, called the measures a ""de facto coup d'etat"". This video can not be played Police inspector: 'We are not politicians' Barcelona Mayor Ada Colau said it was a ""serious attack on the rights and freedoms of all, both here and elsewhere"". But InÃ©s Arrimadas, head of the centrist Ciudadanos party in Catalonia, which is against independence, said holding fresh elections would ""restore goodwill and democracy"" in the region. Guy Hedgecoe, BBC News, Madrid Mariano Rajoy's use of Article 155 had been widely anticipated but his announcement when it came still had a huge impact. The article has never been invoked before, so there was a certain amount of mystery surrounding its potential reach and meaning. Although Mr Rajoy insists Catalonia's self-government is not being suspended, many will disagree. The removal from office of Carles Puigdemont and all the members of his cabinet, to allow ministers in Madrid to take on their duties, amounts to a major reining in of Catalonia's devolved powers. The Spanish prime minister said one of his aims was to restore peaceful co-existence to Catalonia with these measures. Many Catalans who want to remain in Spain will approve of this strident action. But those who want independence for their region are likely to see this as a provocation rather than a solution. Even though Spain's constitutional court ruled it illegal, Catalonia's regional government held a referendum on 1 October to ask residents of the region if they wanted to break away. Of the 43% of Catalans said to have taken part, 90% voted in favour of independence. Unionist parties who won about 40% of the vote at the 2015 Catalan elections boycotted the ballot and many anti-independence supporters stayed away, arguing it was not valid. Mr Puigdemont and other regional leaders later signed a declaration of independence but immediately suspended it in order to allow for talks. He then defied two deadlines set by the national government to clarify Catalonia's position.

Baby dies in sixth-floor window fall,"A woman has been arrested on suspicion of murdering an 18-month-old boy who fell from a sixth-floor flat window. It ""quickly became apparent"" the boy had died when police were called to Newcastle House in Barkerend Road, Bradford, at 17:10 BST on Saturday. A 23-year-old woman arrested on suspicion of murder is receiving medical assessment in custody. One woman told how she, her husband and a friend tried to save the child, who was naked when he fell. Danuta Tomaszewicz, 59, said she had been on her phone, looking out of the window from a first-floor flat when she suddenly noticed the child on the ground below. She thought the child was a doll at first, she said. Her niece, Monika Tomaszewicz, said: ""She screamed for help and her husband and his friend ran downstairs. ""The friend took his shirt off because the baby was naked."" She said the ambulance arrived after about 20 minutes. Mrs Tomaszewicz's niece added: ""She could not sleep at all last night. ""She doesn't know how she is going to live here as every time she looks out of the window she will see the baby. ""They tried their best for the baby."" Andrew White, 53, said he lived on the same landing as the flat where the baby fell. He said a couple with two young children live there. Mr White, a father-of-three with four grandchildren, said: ""They are a nice young couple who keep themselves to themselves which is normal here."" West Yorkshire Police said it was an ""extremely traumatic incident"". Det Supt Nick Wallen said: ""Specially trained officers are working to support the child's family members and those who witnessed what took place. ""It is no exaggeration to say those who witnessed this incident will have been deeply traumatised by what they saw."" Police said they were not looking for anyone else in connection with the death. Newcastle House, which is in the city centre, is a seven-storey block of flats with shops on the ground floor. An unnamed resident, who lives on the same landing where the boy had fallen from, said: ""There's quite a high turnover of people in these flats, you wouldn't necessarily know your neighbours. I just keep to myself."" He said there were people of different nationalities living in the block. The resident said he saw police activity in the flats on Saturday night but only discovered what happened the next morning by watching the news. ""It's horrible,"" he said. ""It's hard to take.""

Abseiling down a cliff at night to kill 500 gannets,"The Faroe Islands are home to an impressive array of seabirds but there is only one colony of gannets, located on the most westerly island, Mykines. The young birds are considered a delicacy by the islanders. So, once a year, hunters abseil down the cliffs to catch the birds. It takes eight fit men to carry the 150m of thick rope which will form the essential lifeline for the bird catchers. As thick as a man's wrist, it has to be lugged along a cliff-top path and then across a narrow gorge to the adjoining island of Mykinesholmur. Oscar Joensen lays out the long rope needed for the climb Skirting a colony of chattering puffins outside their burrows, I followed the men for an hour towards the gannet cliffs, 150m high, and dropping almost vertically into the Atlantic swell. Carrying the rope out to the bird cliffs takes a strong team As dusk fell I could see the ghostly white shapes of the adult birds, cruising silently above the darkening ocean. About 50 men had taken the small ferry out to the island to help with the hunt, essential now that Mykines's single village only has about a dozen full-time residents. Mykines village only has a dozen full-time residents On a steep grassy incline we stopped to rest. In the half-light, food supplies were shared - bread andskerpikjot, fermented legs of lamb, which the men carved with sharp hunting knives at their belts. Once it was dark, the final climb to the cliff edge where the birds nest began. Nesting gannets can be seen on the northerly cliffs of Mykinesholmur One by one the men stepped into a simple harness cushioned with sheep's wool, and abseiled backwards down the rock face. The drop is sheer and within seconds they were out of sight. Once on a suitable ledge below, each of them removed the safety harness and the rope was hauled back up for the next man. Men from the rope team are needed to pull the hunters back up the cliffs ""Hiva! Hiva!"" came the cry to pull together. Once about a dozen men had been deposited on ledges out of sight, the rest of us could only wait, and in my case imagine the slaughter going on below. From Our Own Correspondenthas insight and analysis from BBC journalists, correspondents and writers from around the world Listen on iPlayer, getthe podcastor listen on the BBC World Service, or on Radio 4 on Thursdays at 11:00 and Saturdays at 11:30 BST The constant wind chilled me to the bone, and groups of men lay in the grass through the darkest hours talking about the hunt, wondering how manysula,as they are called locally, would be caught. They seemed impervious to the cold, bred in a country where even in summer it rarely gets above 16C (60F). The hunters were sanguine about the process. ""We look forward to the gannet hunt,"" a young man named Johannus explained. ""The seabirds, the sheep and even the pilot whales which we catch occasionally are all part of the traditional Faroese diet. That's our culture,"" he insisted. ""We don't want to depend on imported food from plastic packets and eat animals kept in captivity all of their lives."" This young gannet still has down rather than feathers, so it will be spared At around 04:30 in the morning a watery dawn light crept across the sea, and we returned to the rope. Slowly and with much effort, hundreds of dead birds tied by the neck in bunches were hauled up. These chicks, just a day or two away from flying for the first time, were large, over 4kg (8lb) in weight and perhaps 80cm (30in) tall. And then the men came. They were an extraordinary sight, faces and hands sometimes as black as if they had been down a coalmine. Reeking of the oily, fishy smell of gannet guano, many had scratched hands and ripped clothes, caused by the birds' spear-like beaks. A gannet's nostrils are inside, rather than outside, its beak The last man up was Espern, the island's chief gannet catcher. Extraordinarily fit and strong he walked up the vertical cliff with the rope in one hand and two live gannets held by the neck in the other. A swift expert cut to the back of the neck and in a second the great grey creatures hung lifelessly from a beefy human hand. But the night's work was not over. Now the birds had to be thrown from the cliffs into the sea to be picked up by a small fishing boat which would deliver them to the village jetty. Otherwise, in rougher weather, the men would have to carry the rope and climbing equipment as well as around 500 birds, all the way back to the village. A boat waits at the bottom of the cliffs to collect the birds Later, after a hearty serving of soup, we were allowed to choose two birds each, as a reward for helping raise and lower the rope during the long cold night. We had all been up for the best part of two days and a night, but everyone was in a good mood. ""Now you know what to do, you must come again next year,"" said Johannus. ""And maybe try going down the cliff next time."" It was a generous offer. But I know I'm simply not brave enough.

Old banger v diesel: Which is more toxic?," I have a memory of my dad from the 1980s. Every summer we would drive to France, taking the ferry from Portsmouth to Le Havre. As we were about to dock, people would get into their cars and start their engines. There would be a 10-or-15-minute delay before the doors opened and the cars started down the gangplank on to French soil. Until that happened, exhaust fumes began to fill the car deck. My dad would rail against the practice. He would tap on people's windows and ask them to turn off their engines. In those days there was lead in petrol, but the main problem was carbon monoxide. Dad was a surgeon and here were people needlessly filling their bodies with toxins from their exhausts. All because they couldn't wait to turn that key in the ignition. Tom and his parents on a ferry to France in the 1980s At the time I was embarrassed. Why were we always the last ones to turn our engine on? It's more than 30 years since those Townsend Thoresen ferry crossings. And today what gets me is this - these days my dad drives a diesel. Tom and his dad, Hubert Diesels are in the newspapers nearly every day. They are killing thousands of people in the UK every year, we read. The diesel driver is a new kind of bogeyman. But when I ask my dad when he's going to scrap his car for the good of humanity, he looks at me with a mixture of surprise and annoyance. “Why would I do that?” Three weeks later I am near Wandsworth Bridge, stuck in a line of traffic that jerks forward a foot or two at a time. It is early July, London is in the grip of a heatwave and Melvyn, my 23-year-old petrol-fuelled VW Golf, has no air-con. I have my window open and you can almost chew the 30C air - a soupy sludge made from the exhaust gases of the cars, buses and vans around us. Beth, my partner, asks me to close the window for the sake of our 11-week-old baby asleep in the back. We start to argue about which is worse for our daughter - overheating or exhaust fumes. Beth wins. The windows are shut, the car gets warmer, but at least we are keeping the noxious gases out. Or some of them. These two experiences will lead, months later, to a family experiment. Father and son, two cars, and the same type of emissions test that rumbled VW. We want to find out whose car is worst for human health. The result is interesting. But the real surprise is that few people really know what their cars are doing to us, and that some new cars are far, far worse than others, and even worse than some old cars. I'd been thinking about London's air ever since Beth and I moved back from a year in the French countryside. In January 2017, a month after our return, London briefly overtook Beijing for levels of particulates - tiny soot particles that can lodge in the lungs or enter the bloodstream. Smog in London, January 2017 Londoners were advised to reduce their physical activity, particularly outdoors. Across the UK, vehicle pollution in the form of particulates and nitrogen oxides was killing 40,000 people per year, according to government figures. Aberdeen, Birmingham, Bournemouth, Burnley, Chelmsford, Derby, Leeds, Northampton, and Sheffield were just some of the towns and cities mentioned for exceeding limits on nitrogen dioxide. Hang on, I thought, weren't engines supposed to be getting cleaner? Three weeks later I am near Wandsworth Bridge, stuck in a line of traffic that jerks forward a foot or two at a time.

Hang on, I thought, weren't engines supposed to be getting cleaner? The Volkswagen scandal two years ago showed just how untrustworthy official emissions figures were for diesels. While particulates are the achilles heel of older diesels, new diesels have efficient particulate filters. What they struggle to control is NOx - oxides of nitrogen, the most harmful of which is nitrogen dioxide. In the US, researchers believe there is a strong link between inhaling nitrogen oxides and lung and heart problems, and this has resulted in tighter emission limits. In order to get its diesels into the country, VW realised it would have to cheat. So it installed “defeat devices” in the car's on-board computer that would recognise when a test was taking place and lower NOx emissions for the duration of the test. For older cars - petrol or diesel - emissions figures simply aren’t available. Even if you trust the official figures issued when they were first made, the engines will have become less efficient and more polluting over time. But how much? You’ll be hard pressed to find out. Mulling all this over, an idea began to take shape. My dad and I had two very interesting cars. The kind of cars that would be held up as just the kind we should be scrapping. Why not test my ageing petrol Golf against dad's newer Skoda Octavia diesel? It would be Top Trumps - but for emissions rather than 0-60 in 3.8 seconds. I was hoping our two cars would tell us something about the existing stock of cars on the road. My dad's car was made in 2009, so it's eight years old, the average age of a car in the UK. Mine, at 23 years old, is a senior citizen. But that too would tell us something about petrol engines from the distant past and how they age. Despite the outcry about air quality, no-one really knows how to frame the problem. Is it all to do with the type of engine - diesel v petrol? Is it the age of the engine - are old bangers the problem? Or is it about the manufacturer - are some makes better than others? And then what about NOx and particulates - are some good on one and poor on the other? And where does that leave carbon dioxide emissions, the greenhouse gas now rather forgotten in our focus on the more immediate peril of particulates and NOx? In late July the government published its air quality plan - after being compelled to by the High Court. The document put the onus on local authorities to enforce controls where limits on NOx were being exceeded. Highly polluting vehicles could be charged or banned from certain areas. A car scrappage scheme was not in the plan but neither was it ruled out. London has already jumped the gun with its T Charge, to begin on 23 October, which will charge drivers of pre-2005 cars (Euro 1, 2 or 3 in the jargon) an extra £10 to enter the congestion zone, regardless of whether their car is petrol or diesel. It is a precursor to the much more ambitious Ultra Low Emission Zone, penalising any vehicle made before autumn 2009 (pre-Euro 5) - which now seems likely to come into force in 2019 and to cover a large area between the North and South Circular ring roads. In other words, local government is coming for you. But are they going after the right targets? At a certain point my mother and father go to a lecture by Prof Frank Kelly who advises the government on the medical effects of air pollutants. He paints a stark picture. The closer you get to an exhaust pipe the more serious the problem is, the air at a busy junction is worse than on a quiet street a stone's throw away. Kelly recommends using back streets and keeping away from the kerb. This is not some amorphous cloud. Each individual car's exhaust is causing damage to individual people on every street. Dad was fascinated but also concerned. I sense his attitude has mellowed since we last discussed diesels. I seize the moment. We always used to buy petrol cars when I was growing up. So why, about 15 years ago, did he switch to diesel? It was to do with fuel economy, he explains. You can go further on a gallon of diesel, and in France - on holiday, travelling long distances - it was much cheaper. Hubert de Castella - Tom's dad Diesel was not seen as perfect, he recalls. He remembers being encouraged to phone a hotline to report dirty diesels with their telltale black smoke. But a well-tuned diesel was seen as the superior technology for miles per gallon and carbon dioxide emissions. Indeed, when I check I see that in 2001 the then chancellor Gordon Brown introduced tax breaks for diesel cars because of their lower CO2 emissions. “We didn't think much about NOx at that time,” my dad says. “It's all come to light, the actual forms of pollution, in the last two or three years as far as the public are concerned. It shows that people do the wrong things for the right motives.” But knowing what we do now, shouldn't drivers like him be penalised? (I'm enjoying grilling my dad the way he has often grilled me over the years.) He isn't fazed though. “I think once the word ‘penalising’ comes into it people would start litigation saying, 'You got us into this mess, so how dare you penalise us for what we've done on your behalf,’” he replies. It seems to me that one might also blame those carmakers who have helped disguise the extent of the problem, either by cheating or simply by designing cars that pass emissions tests in the lab but continue to emit high levels of pollutants in real-world driving. And this brings me on to my final question. I ask if he's willing to submit the Skoda to an independent emissions test. “My Golf versus your Skoda, may the best car win - what do you say?” He thinks about it for a second, smiles and nods wearily. I sense that deep down he's also curious to find out what his car is pumping into the air. It's a bet of sorts. So what about the stakes? We settle on a pint. I may have my Dad on board. But how do you even get a car tested for emissions? You can't just walk in off the street and ask a garage for a NOx or particulate test. A garage tests emissions as part of the MoT. But it’s quite a crude system - it doesn't pick up NOx and misses invisible particulates. The best way of finding out what a car emits is to test it in real-world driving, with a PEMS - portable emissions measurement system. This is the kit that a bunch of students and their lecturers at the University of West Virginia used to identify differences in what VW cars emitted in a lab and what they produced on the roads. It led to dieselgate. Very few people in the UK seem to have a PEMS kit though. I assumed there would be a government-funded research centre to study vehicle emissions. The closest I can find, though, is the Transport Research Laboratory, which in the 1970s invented the mini-roundabout, and was privatised in 1996. But they don't have a PEMS kit. I do find two vehicle testing firms who regularly use PEMS. The first discusses my request internally for a week before saying they don't have the capacity for “ad hoc emissions testing”. An executive at the second company tells me, as an aside, that their clients are carmakers who don't want any potentially negative coverage of vehicle emissions. I later discover that there is a body called the Vehicle Certification Agency that is responsible for vehicle type approval, including measuring fuel consumption and emissions. But they do not have their own centre, they use private contractors - the two companies I have just been talking to. In the course of my enquiries I also discover the test is expensive. No-one will give precise figures but it's somewhere between £3,000 and £10,000 per car. Due to the unique way the BBC is funded, this isn't going to work. And then I hear about a small independent firm, Emissions Analytics, based in the Buckinghamshire village of Stokenchurch. It was started in 2011 by an Oxford economics graduate called Nick Molden, who spotted what he calls “a market failure” caused by poor data. Nick Molden “The official statistics were leading people to buy the wrong car,” he says. They were told it did 60mpg but in fact it did 40mpg.” Not only that, the regulations were leading the manufacturers to build the wrong kind of car. “They would meet the NOx limit in the lab but it would emit 10 times that when on the road. My mission was to create a new system that was real-world, accurate and independent.” Today the firm tests 500 vehicles a year selling its emissions information to subscribers rather than working for the carmakers. Being independent is their whole USP, Molden says. That's how I find myself in a small hangar with metal roof, breeze block walls and a floor that squeaks when I reverse Melvyn into the narrow space where he will be fitted with the PEMS. Watching the setting up of the test demands patience. First Melvyn is emptied of all the detritus that has built up over my two-and-a-half years' ownership. Then the rear seat is lowered and he is loaded with analyser boxes. A weather probe and GPS emanate from his one operable rear window. GPS is needed to track his journey, including climbs and descents, and weather needs to be factored in to any results. Heavy rain is a bigger problem and can stop the test as it can play havoc with the electrics. Two engineers screw pipes into Melvyn's exhaust. They are then connected to two plastic tubes that look a bit like the kind you find on a vacuum cleaner. Most of the exhaust emissions are released into the air but a small proportion will be measured. One pipe goes into the gas analyser, the other into a machine called a CPN that measures particulates. After about two hours, when it's all assembled, the mechanic hooks the pipes up to cylinders of various different gases and monitors the gas flowing through the system on a laptop. It's a control to check everything's working. In the back of the car a loud whirring noise comes from a fan used to cool the analysers, which get hot during the test. How will Melvyn cope? He's been around Europe under a previous owner (a retired Australian gentleman called Melvyn, hence the name). With Beth and me he has picked his way through the Pyrenees and made it to Galicia in north-west Spain. In all, he's clocked up more than 163,000 miles (262,675km). I put the question to Steve Hayton, the project director. A Golf Mk 3 like Melvyn is never going to be super clean but he could be OK, he says. It's all down to how he's been serviced over the years. And then it's time to go. Adam, one of the technicians, drives off in Melvyn, while I follow in a “chase car” driven by Lawrence, another technician. It's a grey day as we set off but Melvyn makes a striking sight. There are silver pipes and black plastic tubes climbing up his rear, some of which feed into a shiny blue box, and his boot - not fully closed - is held together by ties. We arrive at a petrol station, carry out a quick check to make sure everything's working, then the test starts. Nick Molden later tells me that several carmakers have tried to follow their test vehicle to identify the exact route. So I mustn't give too much away. What can be said is that we mix up 20-minute sections - town, country and then motorway - to give an approximation of normal driving. We move through High Wycombe's main roads and back streets, pausing in traffic and waiting for a white van to unload. Soon it becomes leafier, we're passing semi-detached houses with paved drives, acacias and privet hedges. Then we're out of the town and up to 50mph passing wheat fields, woodland and country pubs. Next it's on to the M40 and the Chilterns. We're not far from the opening credits of Vicar of Dibley, Paul the photographer points out. Melvyn is up to 70mph. “That's a diesel,” says Lawrence pointing to a Peugeot van in the slow lane belching black smoke. A petrol engine that's badly tuned produces blue smoke, he says. “But yours looks fine.” We're off the motorway passing sheep, flint houses and village greens in places with names like Piddington. Our speed fluctuates as we round corners and wait behind tractors. It's a far cry from those car advertisements of my youth that measured fuel consumption “at a constant 56mph”. The next day we do it all again with the Skoda Octavia. This time the sun shines, we talk about more than just emissions, and get to know rather a lot about each other's lives. It's the camaraderie of a car journey. At one point the radio bursts unexpectedly into life with Jon Bon Jovi singing “Woah, We're Half-Way There”. It's Peter Kay's Car Share with a PEMS attached. Two-and-a-half hours after the test began, the Skoda arrives back at the hangar. The results won't be ready for a couple of days. So who will they favour - Melvyn or the Skoda? At the time I'm only vaguely aware that they could have ramifications that point far beyond our father-son bet. The moment of truth arrives in the form of an Excel document. Nick Molden is on the phone to talk me through it. “Both cars have stats that are directly comparable with each other and our wider data set,” he begins. “Hopefully it's an interesting result.” “Go on, then,” I think. It’s taken a long time to get this far, and the suspense is killing me. First I must scroll horizontally across a document listing fuel efficiency, CO2 emissions, NOx and carbon monoxide emissions. There are no values for the particulates here - those results have not come back yet, he says. NOx is the big one. And there is a clear winner: the diesel. Although diesels are castigated for being the big offenders as regards NOx, it’s not that simple. In fact Melvyn emits three times more NOx than the Skoda - 0.798 grams per kilometre as opposed to 0.260g/km. The urban/rural/motorway breakdown shows that both cars produce more on the motorway than in the other two settings, which perhaps isn’t surprising as they are going faster and working harder. Nitrogen oxides are at their most dangerous in built-up areas where people breathe them in higher concentrations. Melvyn, a VW Golf GL 1.8, performed a little better in urban driving than he did in the other two parts of the test. But at 0.678g/km his reading is still more than two-and-a-half times worse than the 0.262g/km registered by the Octavia Elegance 1.9. Melvyn's carbon monoxide value is high too. In urban driving it is 3.804g/km - “very poor” by today's standards. But his overall figure of 2.499g/km, taking into account his performance in other parts of the test, means he is still legal. Just. Diesels do not emit much carbon monoxide and the Skoda's urban figure is just 0.014g/km. On fuel economy the Golf posts 34.0 miles per gallon against the Skoda's 50.5mpg. The national average for Euro 6 (post-autumn 2014) petrol cars is 35.6mpg so Melvyn is only a little way behind. For diesel cars it’s 45.0mpg. A side-effect of this is that they produce less CO2, so there was some logic in Gordon Brown’s measures to promote the sale of diesels. I'm relieved to say that neither car is breaking the law. But at the same time, neither would be allowed to be sold new today if these results were obtained in lab conditions. And here it gets interesting. In fact it gets downright controversial. Nick clears his throat. “The average real-world [NOx] emissions from our Euro 6 diesels that we've tested is currently 0.399g/km. The Skoda is about a third less than the current average.” I ask him if I've understood correctly. My dad's 2009 car emits less NOx than most new diesels they've tested in the past three years? Yes, a third less, he says. So how come they are legal if the Skoda would not now pass the legal limit? Here's the tricky bit. The limit on NOx for Euro 6 diesels is 0.08g/km. My dad's Skoda comes in at 0.262g/km. In other words, more than three times today's limit. But it is still better than most modern diesels. Something doesn't add up here. And it's all down to the testing. The new diesels pass the 0.08g/km figure in the lab. Like a child coached to pass an exam they do well in controlled conditions. But out in the real world they struggle. Some of them emit many times the European limit. I dig into theEqua Index, produced by Nick Molden’s company, which gives cars ratings from A to H. Having looked at the data for cars tested in 2016 and 2017, I request the exact NOx figures for some of the more surprising scores. And what comes back is pretty shocking. Here are two examples: ~ The Renault Megane Experience (1461cc) produces 0.991g/km - 12 times the limit (made in 2016, tested in January 2017) ~ The Fiat 500X CityLook Popstar (1598cc) produces 1.153g/km - 14 times the limit (made in 2015, tested in December 2015) But the worst is the Nissan Qashqai, which last month overtook the Ford Fiesta to become the UK's most registered car (counting diesel and petrol models together). The Qashqai N-Connecta DCI CVT (1598cc) produces 1.46g of NOx per kilometre. That is more than 18 times Europe's 0.08g/km limit. It's almost twice Melvyn's score. Five of my dad's Skodas would produce less NOx than this version of the Qashqai. Asked to comment on this poor result, Nissan replied: “Nissan is committed to upholding the law and meeting or exceeding regulations in every market where we operate. All our vehicles sold in Europe meet the Euro 5/6 emission standards.” Renault said all of its vehicles complied with the laws and regulations of the country in which they were sold, adding that it was aware of “significant potential for improvement regarding the release of nitrogen oxides (NOx) in real use conditions”. The company said it had been gradually taking action to reduce the gap between the performance of its vehicles in the lab and on the road, for example by reprogramming their engine injection computer. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said carmakers were investing billions in low-emission technologies to help improve air quality, adding it that it couldn’t comment on “non-official tests”. But how can it be that some new diesels are so dirty? Haven't they improved at all since my dad's car left the factory in 2009? Molden explains that there is a huge range. While most petrol cars leave diesels far behind when it comes to NOx some new diesels are relatively clean and some are very dirty. I look again at the list. It's true the Mercedes C250 AMG Line Premium DAproduces 0.080g/km of NOx in real-world driving, so it complies with the regulations outside the lab as well as inside. A version of the VW Tiguan (the SE-L BiTDI SCR 4MOTION Blue Motion Technology, to give it its full name) even comes in at 0.076g/km, just below the 0.08g/km limit. Both cars produce less than a third of the amount of NOx that my dad's Skoda emits. But they are a rarity. So why are diesels managing to pass strict limits in the lab while producing high levels of emissions on the road? It’s all down to the New European Driving Cycle - the laboratory process in place in Europe since 1997 -  says Anup Bandivadekar, passenger vehicles director at the International Council on Clean Transportation. This puts cars through a test involving steady acceleration, constant speed driving and steady deceleration. It bears no relation to how people actually drive, Bandivadekar says. This narrow focus has made it easy to game the system, he says. Auto makers rather than trying to meet the spirit of the regulations are trying to meet the letter of the law. “There doesn't seem to be enough incentive to do the right thing so companies are doing the bare minimum. That's the crux of this. The technical reasons are multiple.” There is one big disappointment about the Skoda's test results, I discover a couple of days later - it proved impossible to get an accurate measurement of the particulates emitted. Molden is happy to say that Melvyn emitted a negligible quantity of particulates whereas the Skoda emitted more, but due to a technical problem I cannot publish the exact value. So what does the test show? Quite a lot, it seems to me. That a diesel can be better for NOx than an old banger with a petrol engine. That older diesels can beat newer ones. That the European testing regime failed at some point in the last decade. And that the Euro 4, 5, 6, designations are misleading. Belatedly, the authorities have woken up to the problem of misleading lab tests. Last month the European Union began its Real Driving Emissions (RDE) test on all new cars. The SMMT describes the new EU testing regime as the “toughest in the world”. But it is not retrospective, so all the millions of diesels labelled as compliant with the Euro 6 standard on the basis of a flawed lab test are still out there pumping out high levels of NOx. And in Bandivadekar’s view, the RDE test is too lenient. The way it defines “real” driving is still too simplistic, he argues. In addition, until 2019 carmakers will be given leeway of 2.1 times the European limit - diesel cars will be allowed to emit 0.168g/km instead of 0.08g/km. After that they will be given leeway of 1.5 times the limit. This is partly because there is some variability in the results of the PEMS test. The new T Charge arrives next week in London. It will quite rightly penalise my Golf. I'll have to pay £10 to drive into the central London congestion charge zone, in addition to the standard charge. But no-one is stopping me from driving round my built-up area of south-east London. Meanwhile the Skoda, as a Euro 4 car, will not be penalised by the T Charge. But the next big change, the Ultra Low Emission Zone due to come into force in London in 2019, will penalise Euro 4 cars and older. At the same time it will permit the Euro 6 diesels like the Nissan Qashqai N-Connecta DCI CVT to pump out NOx at 18 times the European limit. It all seems very arbitrary. Some cities - Oxford and Paris - have set ambitious targets on banning all combustion engines. Problem sorted? Not according to Prof Frank Kelly, the man whose lecture helped change my dad's mind. Even electric vehicles produce particulates from wear on brake discs and tyres, and by throwing up dust on roads. In any case it seems unlikely that petrol and diesel vehicles will vanish in the next five or 10 years. In which case there's a desperate need to sort the wheat from the chaff, the Tiguans from the Qashqais. In a bid to do this the Mayor of London’s website is now going to publish Emissions Analytics’ Equa Index on its website. When I phone my Dad to discuss the results, he's magnanimous in victory and agrees to accept a half rather than a pint because of the Skoda's higher particulates. He says he is pleasantly surprised by the Skoda's NOx levels. But it's not enough. “I'm going to get rid of it,” he says. It's partly because it's getting old. But he's also done some soul searching. He worries about the particulates and the NOx in the city, so hopes to find a buyer who lives in a rural area. His next car? I wouldn't buy another diesel. I'm wondering about an electric car, but the problem is range. So I'm tempted more by a hybrid.” And what of Melvyn? Eight days after the test I get a call from Beth saying that clouds of steam are billowing from his bonnet and she's been forced to park in a cul-de-sac 10 minutes from home. It turns out to be a broken radiator hose and he's soon back on the road again. But we've made up our mind to have him scrapped. He is 13 times over the NOx limit for a new petrol car after all. It'll be sad to say goodbye. He's only my second ever car. We've been to a lot of places together. He's carried our daughter Hannah in the first six months of her life. But he's dirty and the world will be better off without him. We probably won't replace him - we only bought him to move out of London, and now we're back. It's easy for us to be ethical - Melvyn cost just £950. If you've spent £19,000 on a Nissan Qashqai diesel it'll be rather harder to take a stand to help clean up the air we breathe.
