Call for better virus masks for all medical staff,"Doctors' leaders have called for urgent improvements in personal protective equipment for health workers. The British Medical Association is appealing for a higher grade of face mask to guard against coronavirus infection. It says there is 'growing evidence' that the virus is being spread through the air by aerosols. These are tiny virus particles that can build up in stuffy rooms and they have been linked to outbreaks of Covid-19. This follows an open letter from more than 1,500 health professionals for staff on general wards to be given the type of high-quality masks usually only worn in intensive care units. Public Health England (PHE) has issued guidance on what PPE staff in different settings require. It was last updatedin October 2020,external. Coronavirus: Has the NHS got enough PPE? Covid PPE: Hospital gowns that cost Â£122m never used Early in the pandemic, it was widely believed that to catch the disease you had to either be close to an infected person and hit by droplets from their coughs or sneezes or touch a surface they had contaminated. But research during the course of last year highlighted how it is also possible for the virus to be carried in what are called aerosols, drifting and accumulating in the air. Most infections are thought to have occurred indoors in badly ventilated rooms, and many studies have shown that the 'airborne route' can be an important factor. Across the UK, the guidance for hospital staff is to wear surgical masks in most areas. More sophisticated masks - a type known as FFP3 that includes an air filter - are only required in intensive care or when certain procedures are carried out that are known to generate aerosols. In their letter, the consultants, doctors and nurses say healthcare workers are three to four times more likely to become infected than the general population. But they point out that staff in intensive care units, who have the best level of protection, have about half the risk of catching the virus than colleagues on general wards. The letter states: ""It is now essential that healthcare workers have their PPE upgraded to protect against airborne transmission"". Barry McAree, a consultant surgeon in Northern Ireland, is one of many healthcare workers to be ill with Covid. He is self-isolating at home right after his testing positive for the second time. A signatory to the letter, he says his hospital in Antrim followed the guidance about which type of masks should be worn in which areas, but he became infected nonetheless. It is not clear how and when he caught it. ""There's so much evidence that we are talking about an airborne infection that it has to be said that it is not appropriate just to wear FFP3 in environments when aerosol generating procedures take place."" He believes that with such high levels of the virus in the community and in hospitals, staff should be wearing the higher-grade masks whenever they're close to patients. Surgical masks can be bought online for about 10p each, while the FFP3 masks are far more expensive about Â£5.00. Dr Barry Jones, a retired gastroenterologist and leading expert on aerosols, says that's nothing compared to the cost of a patient with Covid, He points to data showing that roughly a fifth of people needing hospital treatment for Covid may have acquired the infection in hospital in the first place. ""We should do everything we can to reduce that possibility - it's the air we share that's killing us."" A few hospitals have decided to break with official guidance. It's understood that hospitals in Cambridge, Plymouth and Exeter have decided to equip staff with FFP3 masks if they face patients diagnosed with Covid or suspected of having it. One consultant, who did not want to be named, said: ""When you realise patients are more infectious at an earlier stage of disease and are presenting at general wards with poorer ventilation than intensive care units and staff are wearing a poorer quality of PPE, you really want those in a position of leadership to listen and to act."" RCN General Secretary Dame Donna Kinnair, said: ""Without delay, they must state whether existing PPE guidance is adequate for the new variant. ""While more research is carried out, we ask for the precautionary principle to be applied and staff to be given a higher level of PPE if working with suspected or confirmed cases."" Public Health England said this was a matter for NHS England to comment on. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""The safety of NHS and social care staff has always been our top priority and we continue to work tirelessly to deliver PPE that protects those on the frontline. ""UK guidance on the safest levels of PPE is written by experts and agreed by all four chief medical officers. Our guidance is kept under constant review based on the latest evidence and data. ""Emerging evidence and data, including on variant strains, will be continually monitored and reviewed, and the guidance updated accordingly if needed.""

New test rule for UK arrivals pushed back,"Pre-departure Covid-19 testing will now be required for everyone travelling to England from 04:00 GMT on Monday. The rules had been due to come into force on Friday, but the government said people needed time ""to prepare"". Those arriving by plane, train or boat, including UK nationals, will have to take a test up to 72 hours before leaving the country they are in. Anyone arriving from places not on the UK's travel corridor list must still self-isolate for 10 days. The Scottish government is planning to impose the same rules and has had to defer them coming into effect as a result of changes in England. ""This meant Scotland was also obliged to delay implementation as we need sight of their final regulations in order to properly draft and approve the relevant Scottish regulations,"" a spokeswoman said. It is expected the requirement will come into force in Scotland at 04:00 GMT on Monday as well. Wales and Northern Ireland are expected to announce plans for pre-arrival testing in the coming days. Who needs a negative test to travel to the UK? Why is the UK bringing in travel testing? PM: 24-7 vaccine hubs as soon as supply allows Lockdown impact 'starting to show' Announcing the deferral on Twitter,Transport Secretary Mr Shapps said:,external""To give international arrivals time to prepare, passengers will be required to provide proof of a negative Covid-19 test before departure to England from Monday 18 January at 4am."" He also reminded travellers to fill out thePassenger Locator Form,external- used in track and trace - and added that those without proof of a negative test faced a fine of Â£500. Problems with testing availability and capacity mean some countries will initially be exempt. For instance, the requirement will not apply to travellers from St Lucia, Barbados, Antigua and Barbuda until 04:00 GMT on 21 January. Travellers from Falkland Islands, Ascension Islands and St Helena are exempted permanently. Hauliers are exempt to allow the free flow of freight, as are air, international rail and maritime crew. The government has said all forms of PCR test will be accepted, as will other forms of test with ""97% specificity, 80% sensitivity"". The move comes asa further 1,564 people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive Covid test- the biggest figure reported in a single day since the pandemic began. Wednesday's figure brings the total number of deaths by that measure to 84,767. Dr Yvonne Doyle, medical director at Public Health England, said there had now been more deaths in the second wave than the first. Meanwhile on Wednesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was ""concerned"" about a new coronavirus variant that is believed to have emerged in Brazil. He acknowledged it was not yet clear how effective existing vaccines would be against the latest new variant. Mr Johnson said the UK was taking steps to make sure it was not brought into the country. A government Covid committee is meeting on Thursday to discuss the possibility of stopping flights from Brazil. Arrivals from Brazil already have to self-isolate for 10 days.

GCSE and A-level students could face mini exams,"Pupils are currently learning remotely from home A-level, AS and GCSE students in England could be asked to sit mini external exams to help teachers with their assessments after formal exams were cancelled last week. In a letter to the exams regulator, Ofqual, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said this would help teachers to decide ""deserved grades"". He promised not to use an algorithm which led to controversy last summer. Head teachers said the ""devil was in the detail"" for these plans. The letter,externalwas published on Wednesday morning, as Mr Williamson appeared before the education select committee to answer questions on the impact of Covid-19 on education. Gavin Williamson: How has he survived? Williamson pledges 300,000 extra laptops for pupils Teachers' grades for cancelled exams in England In the letter to Ofqual he said: ""A breadth of evidence should inform teachers' judgments, and the provision of training and guidance will support teachers to reach their assessment of a student's deserved grade. ""In addition, I would like to explore the possibility of providing externally set tasks or papers, in order that teachers can draw on this resource to support their assessments of students."" Mr Williamson's pledge not to use an algorithm to determine grades comes after thousands of A-level students had their results downgraded from school estimates last summer - before Ofqual announced a U-turn allowing them to use teachers' predictions. ""We have agreed that we will not use an algorithm to set or automatically standardise anyone's grade,"" the letter says. This video can not be played Gavin Williamson: ""The top priority is for all those that work in schools"" ""Schools and colleges should undertake quality assurance of their teachers' assessments and provide reassurance to the exam boards. We should provide training and guidance to support that, and there should also be external checks in place to support fairness and consistency between different institutions and to avoid schools and colleges proposing anomalous grades."" But he added: ""Changes should only be made if those grades cannot be justified, rather than as a result of marginal differences of opinion. ""Any changes should be based on human decisions, not by an automatic process or algorithm."" A consultation on plans for this year is being launched later this week. Geoff Barton, head of the Association of School and College Leaders, said the letter set out ""broad and sensible parameters"" for assessing GCSEs and A-levels after exams were cancelled. ""But, as ever, the devil will be in the detail of how this is turned into reality,"" Mr Barton said. He welcomed confirmation that no algorithm would be applied this year ""following last summer's grading debacle."" But he questioned how any system of externally set assessment would work and how it could ensures fairness for students whose education had been heavily disrupted. ""It is vital that the final plans not only provide fairness and consistency but that they are also workable for schools, colleges and teaching staff who will have to put them into practice,"" he added. National Education Union joint general secretary Dr Mary Bousted said: ""Had the government listened to the NEU and put in place a contingency plan sooner we would be in a better position now to make sure grades could be awarded reliably and without creating severe workload issues for education staff and students. She said the union would continue to work with the Dfe and Ofqual, but they needed to see the full details of the plans as soon as possible to ensure grades are fair and the process is manageable for staff. Taking questions from MPs on the education select committee, Mr Williamson said he wanted to see schools re-opening at the earliest opportunity and that he would ""never apologise for being the biggest champion for keeping schools open"". He said attendance rates of vulnerable and key worker pupils in schools since the start of term were higher than in the first lockdown. Answering a wide range of questions, Mr Williamson said: confirmed that a national food voucher scheme would be available to all English schools from next week said he was ""absolutely disgusted"" after seeing pictures of food parcels delivered to families by food service provider Chartwells and that the government would ""name and shame"" companies not delivering to standard defended his decision to keep nurseries open, saying that many families rely on early years education services and said there was ""no intention"" to close them said he would ""make no apology"" for pushing to have all those who worked in schools prioritised for vaccination and said he was fighting ""tooth and nail"" to ensure they were vaccinated at the earliest opportunity said mass testing would be rolled out for both teaching and support staff in primary schools by next week, adding that primary teachers and support staff would be able to self-administer tests at home with the help of a Â£78m support package confirmed that the government was looking at a system where parents could test their children at home, saying it was ""not appropriate or right"" to ask staff to test primary-school pupils defended the Department for Education's decision to order Greenwich Council in London to keep its schools open in the last week of the autumn term, saying that their Covid case numbers were far lower than many areas of the north of England and the Midlands, where schools had stayed open the department had procured an additional 1.3 million digital devices for pupils and schools would have 750,000 devices by the end of this week.

How Wales is coping with Covid - in six charts,"This video can not be played See how case rates have changed in each part of Wales How is Covid-19 affecting Wales? Nearly a month since the latest lockdown came into force, hospitals have more patients with the virus than ever before and weekly deaths are close to the peak levels seen at the end of April. But case rates seem to be easing off and the vaccination rollout has started, if a little stutteringly. Here is a snapshot - in six charts - to show where we are. Merthyr Tydfil in lockdown: As early as November, it was among the worst-hit areas of the UK for case rates In the week before Christmas, Merthyr Tydfil had the highest case rate in the UK for Covid-19. From that peak of 1,349 cases per 100,000, it has been cut considerably. The latest figures show 545.5 cases per 100,000, which is 29 positive cases in the past week. But while the south Wales valleys and Bridgend were showing up as hotspots for weeks, concerns have switched to north Wales - and the north east region in particular. Covid patients in hospital now double April's peak Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales NHS staff left 'traumatised' by first Covid wave Health officials believe the faster-spreading variant of Covid-19 has taken root and is responsible for at least 70% of cases in north Wales. Wrexham has seen a steady rise in its case rate. It now stands at 970.9 cases per 100,000 - its highest point. Twelve of its communities make up the highest 20 localised hotspots in Wales, when those figures are broken down further. With at least 30% of recent positive cases in south Wales also due to the new variant, health officials will be anxious to keep a lid on its spread. The case rate in Wales as a whole was for a period in December one of the highest in the world but it has been falling since the week before Christmas. Indeed England - including six of its regions - and Northern Ireland are now ahead of it. The chief medical officer for Wales Frank Atherton cautiously welcomed this ""small fall."" He also said around 20% of tests were now coming back positive, down from 25% last week. ""This is heading in the right direction but is still too high and shows that there's still a lot of coronavirus circulating in the community,"" he said. Doctors believe it could be at least a month before falling case rates work their way through to hospitals. The pressures within Welsh hospitals have been growing - with 36% of all patients in beds having Covid. This is twice the proportion we saw in May. In the Cwm Taf Morgannwg health board, which covers Bridgend, Merthyr Tydfil and Rhondda Cynon Taf, more than half its hospital patients have the virus. There are also record numbers of recovering Covid patients - now more than 1,000. These are people who no longer have the virus but are too sick from the effects of it to be allowed home. The numbers in critical care or on ventilators are the highest seen since the peak of the pandemic in April. The challenges of containing Covid-19 infections within hospitals themselves have proved difficult. There have now been more than 3,300 infections linked to hospital outbreaks since the start of October, with 271 new cases in the most recent week. Not seen in the figures themselves are the effects on staff, who were said by NHS Wales bosses on Wednesday to be exhausted and on a ""constant treadmill."" The number of Covid-19 deaths during the pandemicpassed the 5,000 mark in Walesin the latest weekly update from the Office for National Statistics. Rhondda Cynon Taf has the worst mortality rate - and by one measure has the highest across England and Wales. On the day the most recent lockdown came into force, there were 65 deaths involving Covid-19 in Wales - the worst in a single day since April. It is still running at an average of 43 a day in the past week. Looking at the five-year average - seen as a reliable measure - so far this year there have been 3,945 ""excess"" deaths in Wales. Behaviour has changed over lockdowns, as revealed by the mobile phones we carry around.Mobility data tracked from the likes of Googleshow dramatic drops in journeys to work, on public transport and to shops. This information is gleaned by scientists and policy-makers as part of the overall picture on formulating the restrictions to reduce transmission of the virus. We can see again how the lockdown just before Christmas caused some of the most dramatic shifts yet - but partly of course, people would be spending more time at home anyway. More people in Wales were back grocery shopping, and more quickly, than after previous lockdowns. But it is still not back to the period before Christmas and is 20% below the baseline, where we were back in May. Workplace data also suggests not as many are working from home than during the April-May lockdown. After an admittedly slow start off the blocks, Wales' vaccine rollout programme saw more than 10,000 first doses administered at the start of the week, almost double the number the previous day. Although the overall proportion is still behind the other UK nations, there was a sign of drawing closer to England and Scotland's rate in the latest daily figures. Wales will hope to catch up as it aims to reach 1.5 million people in the first phase. Covid in Wales: What do the stats tell us?

Mum's 'sadness' at 'mean' free school meal parcel,"England and Man Utd footballer Marcus Rashford is a high-profile campaigner for children on free school meals and said the PM had assured him ""he is committed to correcting the issue"" A mother who posted a photo on social media of a food parcel she received has told of the ""sense of sadness"" she felt on seeing what it contained. The mother, who wants to be anonymous, told the BBC: ""As I unpacked that food parcel... and looked at the contents, it felt very sad and depressing."" Chartwells, the firm which supplied the parcel, has apologised. The education secretary said schools will be able to offer vouchers rather than food parcels from next week. Gavin Williamson told the education select committee on Wednesday that he was ""absolutely disgusted"" by the photo of the food parcel's contents, and that his department had made it clear ""this sort of behaviour is just not right [and] will not be tolerated"". He said the government would ""support any school that needs to take action"" and ""name and shame those that are not delivering against the standards"" set by the Department for Education. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer challenged Boris Johnson on online images of the ""disgraceful"" food parcels during Wednesday's Prime Minister's Questions (PMQs). What free school meals are children supposed to get? School food firm apologises after Rashford intervenes The PM insisted the government had ""massively increased the value of what we're providing"" in the form of anotherÂ£170m in the winter grant scheme, Â£220m for holiday activities and food programme, as well as the rollout of the national voucher scheme. He expressed his gratitude to the footballer Marcus Rashford - a high-profile campaigner for children on free school meals who shared images of some parcels online - for highlighting the issue. Speaking to MPs on the Commons Liaison committee on Wednesday afternoon, Mr Johnson said the free school meals pictured online do not reflect government guidance, adding it was a ""scandal and a disgrace that some companies are trying to get away with the provision that they're offering"". The PM added that it was the decision of the schools on whether or not to have vouchers or food parcels, saying that about 75% opt for vouchers but that some schools wish to continue to support caterers. Mr Rashford, who has met with Chartwells andspoke to Mr Johnson earlier,external, called for a ""full major review"" of the free school meal system. In a Twitter thread on Wednesday,,externalMr Rashford said many vulnerable children had been helped during the pandemic ""thanks to the efforts of individuals, businesses, charities, educators, and government"". But he added: ""It's 2021. Our eyes are open. Now is the time for a full major review of the Free School Meal system."" Food parcels have been sent to pupils in England who would normally be eligible for free school meals while schools are closed during the coronavirus lockdown. The national voucher scheme providessupermarket vouchers through an online portal. The government had previously used this scheme duringthe first lockdown. A row broke out after the mother, using the online name Roadside Mum, posted a photo on Twitter of two carrots, two potatoes, a tin of baked beans and a small range of other food items, which she calculated to have cost about Â£5. The post prompted others to complain about the quality and quantity of the food they had received in similar parcels. The mother, who is disabled, had thought it was supposed to last 10 school days and should have been worth Â£30. ""Public funds were charged Â£30. I'd have bought this for Â£5.22,"" said Twitter user Roadside Mum of the parcel she received She told BBC Breakfast: ""As I unpacked that food parcel in my living room and looked at the contents, it felt very sad and very depressing. ""One of my children came in and saw me laying this out on the floor, and I said I was going to picture it because it didn't look like a lot. ""I could see the child's realisation that this is what I've been given to eat for a week and the sense of sadness. ""Where has the rest of the food gone? This is meant to be a week's food. Why is it so mean?"" Lockdown meals teacher restarts deliveries Inside Rashford's campaign to tackle child hunger 'I remember going to bed with hunger pains' Chartwells, the company that provided the parcel, said it was actually only intended to last one school week and had cost Â£10.50 for food, packing and distribution. In a further statement posted on Wednesday,external, the firm, which is owned by Compass group, said it had ""fully investigated"" its food parcels provision in the last few hours. It apologised for those parcels that did not meet the firm's high standards, and committed to refunding the costs. It added that from Monday, the lunches would be enhanced to reflect the Department for Education's additional allowance of Â£3.50 per week per child. The company has since said,externalthat it will add breakfast free of charge into the food parcels from 25 January, and will continue to do so while schools are closed. It will include bread, butter, yoghurts, juice, milk, oats and fruit, it said.

""It's very humiliating,"" one parent toldPolitics Home.,external""Why would you decide for us? Why not give us the money?"" Future Academies, which runs the school, told the BBC it had asked its caterers to improve the quality of its food parcels. Impact Food Group, the suppliers, said the pot contained ""bread mix"" and the only extra ingredient needed was water. The intention was to help parents create ""an interactive cooking experience"" with their children and to help with some food education at home, he said. The academy chain has said its own voucher scheme would start on 18 January. Rachel said she was not 'impressed' with the amount of food in one parcel she received Rachel Rodgers, a mother of three children aged 14, eight, and five, said she was not ""impressed"" with the amount of food provided in a parcel for her youngest child. Rachel, from Essex, says: ""I got so much more with the vouchers. I always looked for meat and vegetables on offer at the supermarket, so I made the vouchers stretch even more. ""What am I supposed to do with one potato?"" Rachel, who receives food parcels for her two youngest children and a voucher for her eldest, says it would have been ""nice to get a little more"" food, adding that ""even sandwich meat would have been good"". One mother said she was 'disappointed' by the food parcel she received for her two children, who are at secondary school One mother of three says she was ""disappointed"" by the contents of food parcels. The mum, who does not want to be identified, says the food box she received for two of her children at secondary school contained sliced frozen bread ""[which] did not stay fresh""; two slices of cheese that [were] ""hard and taste disgusting"", as well as beans, tinned tomatoes, apples, pasta and potatoes. She says her youngest child, who is in primary school, received a parcel of five rolls ""that were going stale"", grated cheese, three packs of crackers, five yoghurts and packs of biscuits. The mother adds: ""It is a good job I already had some cheese and bacon in the fridge, because this is disheartening. ""We have never had support feeding our children through the holidays even when I was young. We need help now."" The initial social media images of food parcels drew widespread criticism. Becca Lyon, head of child poverty campaigns at Save the Children, said the charity welcomed the return of the voucher scheme - adding that theproblems some families had with the vouchers last yearshould not be repeated. Anne Longfield, the children's commissioner, called on companies to provide ""real food and real amounts that will really help families"". Meanwhile, Dr Max Davie, of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said the contents of the food parcels were ""not nutritionally sufficient for children and young people"". Parcels should contain food items rather than pre-prepared meals due to food safety considerations Minimise the fridge and freezer space that schools and families will need to store foods Contain items which parents can use to prepare healthy lunches for their child/children across the week Not rely on parents having additional ingredients at home to prepare meals Not contain items restricted under the school food standards Cater for pupils who require special diets, for example, allergies, vegetarians or religious diets - schools should ensure there are systems in place to avoid cross-contamination Contain appropriate packaging sizes for household use, rather than wholesale sizes Source:Department for Education,external In Wales, the provision of free school meals during the holidays has been extended by a year, and the Northern Ireland Executive made a pledge in November to provide free school meals in holidays until Easter 2022. In Scotland - where holiday provision is currently promised up to Easter 2021 - both the SNP and the Scottish Conservatives have pledged to fund free school meals for all primary school pupils during term-time and holidays if they win the 2021 Scottish election.

Dealer's last Nazi-looted work returned to owners,"Many of the works in Gurlitt's collection were in poor condition when they were discovered in 2012 (file photo) When a trove of 1,500 artworks hoarded by the son of a Nazi-era art dealer was discovered in 2012, an investigation began to find out how many were looted from Jewish owners. Eventually only 14 were conclusively identified as looted, and now Germany has declared the last of those works has been returned to the owner's heirs. Das Klavierspiel (Playing the Piano) by Carl Spitzweg was owned by music publisher Henri Hinrichsen. He was murdered at Auschwitz in 1942. German Culture Minister Monika GrÃ¼tters said the return of the work sent an ""important signal"", and that while it could not make up for the deep suffering, it could ""make a contribution to historical justice and fulfil our moral responsibility"". The 19th-Century work by Spitzweg was confiscated by the Nazis in 1939, the same year that Hinrichsen had bought it. Das Klavierspiel by Carl Spitzweg was seized by the Nazis in 1939 It was bought in 1940 by Hildebrand Gurlitt, a Nazi-era dealer who had been given the task by Adolf Hitler of dealing in art seized from Jewish collectors and of buying up so-called ""degenerate art"" removed from museums for a planned FÃ¼hrermuseum in the Austrian city of Linz. The money for the Spitzweg work was paid into a blocked account, so Hinrichsen would never have received it. In 2015, the piece was identified as looted, and it was handed over to the auctioneers Christie's on Tuesday, according to the wishes of Hinrichsen's heirs. In pictures: Nazi art trove on display One lonely man and his hoard of Nazi art Swiss museum to accept 'Nazi art' Although his collection of 1,500 works, plundered from museums as well as individuals, was initially confiscated after the war by the Allies, Hildebrand Gurlitt eventually managed to get it back. Gurlitt died in the 1950s and when German authorities approached his widow in 1961 in search of part of his collection, she claimed the works had been destroyed at the end of World War Two by Allied bombing. This video can not be played The BBC's Stephen Evans was granted exclusive access to look at some of the long-lost masterpieces in 2014 It was only when tax investigators searched the Munich flat of his son Cornelius Gurlitt in 2012 that they found more than 1,400 of the works. Another 60 pieces were discovered at his Austrian home in Salzburg the following year. The son died in 2014 with questions still hanging over the ownership of the collection - as he was protected by a statute of limitations. A court ruled that the works could be bequeathed to the Museum of Fine Arts in the Swiss capital Bern, as Cornelius Gurlitt had requested. While some of the works were deemed to belong to the family, the German Lost Art Foundation then tried to find out, with the Swiss museum, who were the rightful owners of the rest. Fourteen pieces have now conclusively identified as belonging to Jewish owners and returned.

Tightening of Scottish lockdown rules announced,"This video can not be played Covid in Scotland: Stricter retail and takeaway rules 'to cut contact' Covid restrictions around takeaway and click and collect services in Scotland are to tighten. Only shops selling essential items - such as clothing, footwear, baby equipment, homeware and books - will be allowed to offer click and collect. Collections must also be outdoors, with appointments staggered to avoid queuing. And takeaways can no longer allow customers indoors, and must instead operate from a hatch or doorway. Retail organisations have warned that the new restrictions could be ""revenue-crushing"" for many businesses and would further harm already struggling retail and hospitality firms. The changes are among six new rules that will come into force on Saturday. They also include a ban on drinking alcohol outdoors in level four areas - which includes mainland Scotland and some islands - meaning takeaway pints cannot be consumed on the street or in places such as parks. Live: Stricter rules within days in Scotland What are Scotland's six new lockdown rules? Analysis: Business clicks but doesnât collect And statutory guidance will also be published for employers to support people working from home. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said that it essentially meant that if people were working from home during the lockdown last year, they must do so again this time. Rules around work carried out in private properties will also be tightened - with only work for ""maintenance, upkeep and functioning"" to be allowed, rather than for example painting and decorating. Finally, the first minister said the wording of the stay at home law will be altered to ""close an apparent loophole"" by preventing people from leaving home for an essential purpose and then remaining outdoors for non-essential reasons. Click and collect services have been a lifeline for many businesses since the level four rules were imposed across Scotland on Boxing Day Ms Sturgeon said: ""We believe that both individually and collectively these additional measures, in further reducing the interactions that allow the virus to spread, will help our essential efforts to suppress it."" And she urged people to stick to the spirit, not just the letter, of the lockdown rules, saying: ""Don't think in terms of the maximum interactions you can have without breaking the rules. ""Think instead about how you minimise your interactions to the bare essentials to remove as many opportunities as possible for the virus to spread. ""In everything you do, assume that the virus is there with you - that either you have it or any person you are in contact with has it - and act in a way that prevents it passing between you."" The Scottish government is acting now because of the strain on the health service. Its experts are warning the NHS could beoverwhelmed even under a 'stay at home' scenario,external. We've already seen two health boards postponing all non-urgent surgical procedures as an increase in Covid cases puts growing pressure on the system. The action from NHS Lanarkshire and NHS Ayrshire and Arran is showing how the numbers of Covid patients in hospital is really starting to impact on wider care. Wards that would usually treat people recovering from hip or knee replacements for example may need to be converted into Covid wards. Theatres, usually busy carrying out multiple routine surgeries will become high dependency or intensive care facilities. When staff need to be redeployed to work with Covid patients, it is not safe to carry out other routine work. These are the difficult choices many health boards will face over the coming weeks. Action required now to deal with this health emergency will have consequences later. A further 1,949 people have tested positive for Covid-19 in the past 24 hours, representing 10.2% of the total number of people tested. Patients in hospital with a confirmed case rose by 77 to 1,794, while 134 people are in intensive care units. The first minister also announced that the deaths of a further 79 people who had tested positive for the virus have been recorded - bringing the total by that measure to 5,102. But separate figures by National Records of Scotland put the total number of people to have died with confirmed or suspected cases of the virus at 7,074. All of mainland Scotland and some islands were placed into level four restrictions on 26 December - meaning all non-essential shops had to close - with schools remaining closed to most pupils until at least the end of the month. An evidence paper published by the Scottish government, which informed the latest restrictions, said Scotland's R number showed the virus was ""likely in another growth phase"" - although Ms Sturgeon said there were some signs that the lockdown was ""starting to stabilise"" the virus. The paper concluded that the current pattern of case numbers meant that rising levels of infection impacting hospitals and ICU was expected. It said this could lead to the NHS being ""overwhelmed"" in some areas ""even under a 'stay at home' scenario"". Business organisation CBI Scotland said click and collect services were often a ""lifeline"" for struggling small businesses amid the forced closure of all non-essential shops. And it said the government must publish ""compelling"" evidence to justify the tightening of restrictions. CBI Scotland director Tracy Black said: ""When well organised, click and collect services instinctively feel like a safe way for firms to keep trading. ""Of course, firms can choose to suspend click and collect if that makes sense for them, but for many others it could mean the difference between business survival or not."" The Scottish Chambers of Commerce said the new rules would ""only add to the growing desperation of businesses who have put finance and time aside to make their business Covid compliant, only to have to close anyway, with no clear route back to reopening.'' There have also been concerns that limiting click and collect will merely encourage more people to go to supermarkets to shop instead."" Scottish Conservative group leader Ruth Davidson said business owners felt the evidence for the ""unexpected"" decisions had not been made clear, and called on the first minister to ensure sufficient financial support was put in place.

Human remains found in search for missing cyclist,"Tony Parsons was last seen on 29 September 2017 Police have discovered human remains during a search for a man who went missing more than three years ago during a charity cycle ride. Tony Parsons, from Tillicoultry, was last seen on 29 September 2017 outside the Bridge of Orchy Hotel. Detectives said the discovery was made during a detailed search of a remote site close to a farm near the A82 at Bridge of Orchy. Police said that Mr Parsons' family have been made aware of the discovery. Efforts to recover the remains will continue over the coming days before a post mortem is held to establish their identity. Two men, both aged 29, were arrested and then released pending further inquiries in December in connection with the disappearance of Mr Parsons. Police have been carrying out searches in the area in recent days Det Ch Insp Alan Somerville said: ""This is clearly a significant development and extensive work is ongoing to recover the remains and confirm their identity. ""We have informed Mr Parsons' family, who are being supported by specialist officers. ""The thoughts of everyone involved in the investigation are with them at this difficult time.""

British tourist blamed for cancelled ski race,"The Lauberhorn course is the longest downhill run in the world (file image) A British tourist has been blamed for a spike in coronavirus cases that led officials to cancel Switzerland's famous Lauberhorn ski race. The resort of Wengen, where the race is held, had recorded only 10 cases of the virus by mid-December. But the number soon began to rise and many cases have since been linked to the new highly infectious variant of Covid-19 first identified in the UK. At least 27 cases are connected to one British tourist, contact tracers say. The tourist stayed in a hotel in Wengen over the holiday period. The Lauberhorn course is the longest downhill run in the world, and racers can reach speeds of 160km/h (100 mph). Defiant ski nations bid to save holiday season 'Momentous' errors in ski resort Covid outbreak Border checks to stop French skiing abroad Officials desperately tried to save the race, shutting schools and offering to close off the resort to everyone but the competitors. Swiss health officials initially agreed with the plan, but a further jump in cases at the start of this week prompted them to pull the emergency brake and cancel the event. The Lauberhorn track is 4,480m (14,700ft) long - and the race will now have to wait until 2022 Wengen is devastated. The Lauberhorn is one of the top competitions on the World Cup ski circuit. It is dearly loved by the Swiss, who have watched with delight as some of their own homegrown talent, such as Beat Feuz and Carlo Janka, have triumphed there. Moreover, the long love affair between Switzerland and British winter tourists has frosted over to some extent. It was only last month thatthe vanishing Brits of Verbier, who reportedly fled Switzerland rather than accept the government mandated quarantine, triggered a flurry of negative headlines. This video can not be played Italy's Foppolo ski resort was closed until 6 January and missed the all-important Christmas ski season Now the high point of Switzerland's skiing calendar has been abruptly cancelled, and some Swiss blame the British. Others say Switzerland only has itself to blame. While neighbours France and Italy closed their resorts over the festive period, the Swiss government opted for a precarious balancing act. It kept its slopes open, but closed all bars and restaurants and limited ski lifts to two-thirds capacity. Most Swiss resorts are quiet, with just a few locals enjoying the runs. But still some tourists arrived and, as Wengen's experience shows, just one infected guest is enough to cause major damage. Instead of hosting a major ski race, Wengen officials are now racing to control the virus. Mass testing has already begun in the resort. Switzerland's government has extended the closure of bars, restaurants, museums, and theatres until the end of February in a bid to control the new variant. It has also ordered non-essential shops to close and made working from home obligatory. As for the Lauberhorn, Switzerland's oldest and fiercest skiing rival, Austria, will now host the postponed event. Nothing could have been calculated to upset the Swiss more. The event was first moved to the Austrian ski resort of KitzbÃ¼hel, but an outbreak of coronavirus there has prompted another move, this time to Flachau, 100km to the east. The cluster of cases in Jochberg near KitzbÃ¼hel broke out among a group of mainly British trainee ski instructors.

Belgian king caught in clashes over custody death,"The Belgian interior minister has condemned the violence Hundreds of people rioted in Brussels on Wednesday night over the death of a 23-year-old in police custody at the weekend. Video from the scene shows King Philippe's car being hit by projectiles as it passed through the area. A police station was reportedly briefly set on fire during the unrest, which saw local streets vandalised. A police spokeswoman told the AFP news agency they had made several arrests and said four officers were injured. Police said about 500 people gathered Wednesday close to Brussels-North police station over the death of a person identified in Belgian media as Ibrahima B. Belgium 'wakes up' to its bloody colonial past The man was arrested on Saturday evening after fleeing police who were checking on a group suspected of violating local coronavirus measures. King Philippe's car was protected by police as it drove through the area Officials say he lost consciousness after being taken to a police station and was transported to hospital, where he died at 20:22 local time (19:22 GMT) just over an hour after his arrest. The reasons for his death remain unclear but a police oversight body has opened an investigation, according to the Brussels public prosecutor's office. On Wednesday afternoon protesters marched to a police station at the centre of the inquiry calling for the truth about the death, before the demonstration escalated into violence. Interior Minister Annelies Verlinden has condemned Wednesday's events as ""totally unacceptable"" and sought to assure the public over the investigation. ""We will follow that up and, if necessary, take the necessary steps to also condemn misconduct by the police,""Ms Verlinden was quoted by the Brussels Times as saying,external.

Comic Uncle Roger scraps video with China critic,"Nigel Ng finds himself at the centre of a storm over digital content creators bowing to Chinese censorship Comedian Nigel Ng has deleted a video and apologised to his fans after featuring a YouTuber who had criticised the Chinese government. Nigel Ng has three million subscribers on YouTube where he plays the character Uncle Roger and gives a running commentary on Asian recipe videos. On Tuesday, Mr Ng apologised on Chinese social media for including Mike Chen, a popular YouTuber, in one of his videos. Mr Chen has previously spoken out about the treatment of Uighurs in Xinjiang. Twitter deletes China's Xinjiang women tweet China expands its Uighur detention camps - report Mr Ng's decision has led some to accuse him of pandering to China - while also leaving his fans on Chinese social media confused. UK viewers may be familiar withhis humorous critique of a BBC Good Food recipe for egg-fried rice.,external Mr Ng's video, titled ""Uncle Roger reviews ugliest dumpling ever"", was uploaded to YouTube on Monday. However, it was removed just a day later. Nigel Ng posts videos to YouTube as the character Uncle Roger Mr Ng, a UK-based Malaysian, then apologised on Chinese social media site Weibo for causing a bad ""social impression"" with the video. ""Taking into account the seriousness of the situation and the possible negative effects of the video itself, after discussion, we decided to delete it,"" he wrote. He added that he had not been aware of Mr Chen's ""political thoughts and incorrect comments about China in the past"". Mr Chen, who is based in the US and posts about food on his YouTube channel Strictly Dumpling, has previously criticised the Chinese government's policies and human rights record. In 2019, he criticised Beijing on Twitter, mentioning the treatment of Uighurs in Xinjiang and the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre. He has also been associated with Falun Gong, a spiritual movement banned by the Chinese government. Falun Gong followers say they are a peaceful law-abiding group, following a philosophy and regime of exercises which lead to spiritual enlightenment and improved health. The Chinese government, meanwhile, accuses Falun Gong of being an ""evil cult"". On Tuesday,Mr Chen told the South China Morning Post,external: ""I hold no animosity towards Nigel for what he did, because it's hard to stand up to the [Chinese Communist Party]'s tactics. I do hope that he learns more about the human rights abuses that the CCP has committed because he lives in a free country where he can do that."" ""I have always said that I love China, and I love the kind-hearted Chinese people. They are my people. The CCP, however, is not China and certainly should not be equated to the Chinese people,"" he added. The apology and deletion of the video has caused some people to accuse Mr Ng of self-censoring for the sake of Chinese fans. One person on Twitter wrote: ""Taste of RMB is much better than MSG. Isn't that right Uncle Roger"", referring to the Chinese currency and a flavour enhancer commonly added to some Asian foods. Meanwhile, on Weibo, many people appeared unclear as to what exactly had happened. One user commented: ""Uncle Roger's political sensitivity is so high, we still don't know what happened."" Many Western companies have backtracked and issued apologies in the past, after their products or campaigns angered Chinese social media users and sparked a backlash. For example,in 2019 Versace was forced to apologiseafter one of its T-shirts did not specify that Hong Kong and Macau were part of China, whileDolce & Gabbana faced calls for a boycottin 2018 after one of its campaigns was accused of ""trivialising China's centuries-old culture"". However, it appears Mr Ng's video was deleted very quickly - and before any significant backlash emerged on Chinese social media at all. Observers have long argued that artists and companies have begun self-censoring in order to attract Chinese audiences. Last year, a report by free speech charity PEN America claimed that Hollywood bosseshad been censoring films to avoid losing access to China's lucrative box office market.

Did Trump's words incite the riot?,"Donald Trump has been acquitted of a single impeachment charge that he incited a mob to storm the US Capitol. So what did the president say prior to the violence? On 6 January, thousands of Trump supporters gathered at a ""Save America"" rally organised to challenge the result of last November's presidential election. They listened as Mr Trump spoke to them on the National Mall, near the White House in Washington DC. In a 70-minute address, Mr Trump exhorted them to march on Congress where politicians had met to certify Democrat Joe Biden's win. The attack began moments after he took the applause. Those words have now played a central part in his second impeachment, which lawmakers voted in favour of last month. So what did he say? Here are five key quotes, followed by some legal analysis from Professor Garrett Epps of the University of Baltimore. What verdict means for Trump, Biden and America Capitol riots timeline: How the day unfolded This was three minutes into his speech. It was a false assertion that Democrats used as the starting point for the incitement charge - not just because he said it on this day but for weeks before. This quote appears in the article of impeachment, the charge that was backed by the House of Representatives, lower chamber of Congress. In the months preceding the Joint Session, President Trump repeatedly issued false statements asserting that the Presidential election results were the product of widespread fraud and should not be accepted by the American people or certified by State or Federal officials. Shortly before the Joint Session commenced, President Trump, addressed a crowd at the Ellipse in Washington, DC. There, he reiterated false claims that ""we won this election, and we won it by a landslide"". The article has been sent to the Senate, where Mr Trump's trial will begin on Tuesday. Here Trump was echoing the slogan of the movement to fight Mr Biden's election victory, which was started a day after the result was declared. It soon gathered pace on social media and led to rallies across the US. The largest one yet was the one Mr Trump addressed on 6 January. The deep roots of Trumpâs 'voter fraud' strategy This was Mr Trump saying in the clearest terms yet that he will never accept Mr Biden's win. Referring to himself and his supporters collectively, Mr Trump said there would be no concession. He went on: ""You don't concede when there's theft involved. Our country has had enough. We will not take it anymore."" This video can not be played ""We will never give up, we will never concede"", Trump tells supporters At one point, Mr Trump said the Biden presidency had to be challenged. ""You will have an illegitimate president. That is what you will have, and we can't let that happen."" This is the longest quote from Mr Trump's speech that appears in the article of impeachment. It could also be the one that his lawyers will find hardest to defend in the trial. He also wilfully made statements that, in context, encouraged - and foreseeably resulted in - lawless action at the Capitol, such as: ""if you don't fight like hell you're not going to have a country anymore"". However, Mr Trump's lawyers have argued his use of the word ""fight"" was figurative, which has long been accepted in public discourse. This was the part of Mr Trump's speech that his defenders have seized on to show that he never incited the crowd. He said: ""I know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard."" The language was very different from other sections, which borrowed more from combat or war. Indeed, Mr Trump's lawyers have suggested they will highlight his use of the word ""peacefully"" in the trial. The president used ""we"" but he didn't join them as his supporters took the short walk from the rally to Congress. He said: ""We're going to walk down to the Capitol and we're going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women, and we're probably not going to be cheering so much for some of them."" Can Trump be removed or banned from politics? What is incitement under the law? Incitement is not a crime under the First Amendment unless it meets certain criteria. First of all, it has to be intended to cause violence (and you infer that intent from the circumstances). It also has to be likely to cause violence. If I go downtown and I say to two drunks standing in front of a bank, ""let's rob this bank right now"", I haven't really incited anybody, because it's not very likely they'll rob the bank. If I say let's meet here tomorrow and rip things up, I'm not inciting because - in the words of the Supreme Court - where there is time for better counsels to prevail, the remedy for speech is more speech. The speech has to be likely to cause - and this is very important - imminent violent action. If this was a court of law, does Trump cross the line? It's quite rare that somebody can be convicted of incitement. In applying that to the president's speech at the rally, it's an agonisingly close case. It's pretty goddamn imminent because he's telling people to march to the Capitol and I will march with you. There wouldn't be any time for better counsels to prevail because you're just going to leave the Ellipse and walk down Pennsylvania Avenue. He said we have to fight and show strength, but he also said we're very peacefully and patriotically going to ask, so he's covering himself. In the end, I think it's a jury question. I'm not sure he's entitled to a dismissal of charges as a matter of law. There's some discussion that government leaders have more leeway, but I don't know how that would play out. He clearly knew there were people in that crowd who were ready to and intended to be violent, and he certainly did nothing to discourage that. He not only did nothing to discourage it, he strongly hinted it should happen.

What happens to impeached presidents?,"President Donald Trump has become the first president in history to be impeached twice by the US House of Representatives - and remains one of just three to have been impeached at all. Here's what happened to the others. Andrew Johnson was the first US president to face impeachment In the shadow of the Civil War, President Andrew Johnson - a Democrat - sparred constantly with the Republican-held Congress over how to rebuild the defeated US South. The ""Radical Republicans"" of this period pushed for legislation to punish former Confederate leaders and protect the rights of freed slaves. Johnson used his presidential veto to block the Republican efforts at every turn. In March, Congress passed the Tenure of Office Act, crafted to curtail the president's ability to fire members of his cabinet without approval from the Senate.  In defiance, Johnson suspended a cabinet member and political rival, Edwin Stanton, while Congress was in recess. If today's proceedings seem like a lot of political theatrics, it is in keeping with impeachment tradition: Stanton responded to his firing by locking himself in his office and refusing to leave. Stanton's removal proved to be the final straw - the House Republicans rushed to draft 11 articles of impeachment. A wood engraving shows the Senate trial of Andrew Johnson After a vote along party lines the articles were presented to the Senate, where he was acquitted, but only just. It was a single vote short of the two-thirds majority needed to convict. According to some accounts, Johnson wept at the news of his acquittal, vowing to devote himself to restoring his reputation. It didn't work. He served out the rest of his presidential term, but his final months in office were beset with the same power struggles that warped his tenure prior to impeachment. And in 1869, Democrats lost the White House to Republican candidate General Ulysses S Grant, who allowed his party's plan for Radical Reconstruction to continue. What this means for Trump, Biden and America Did Trump's words at rally incite the riot? Being impeached. And buying Alaska in 1867 for a cool $7.2m. Johnson was also one of the poorest presidents. He never went to school. The near-impeachment of Richard Nixon traces back to the 1972 break-in of the Democratic party's headquarters at the Watergate office complex in Washington DC. As investigations revealed that the burglars had been paid with funds from Nixon's re-election campaign, the Watergate scandal spread far beyond the break-in, implicating top White House officials. For nearly two years, Nixon scrambled to cover up his role in the conspiracy, leading to his eventual demise. The Republican president's efforts proved futile. In August 1974, as the House Judiciary Committee prepared impeachment articles, Nixon was forced to release Oval Office recordings in which the president is heard ordering his staff to have the CIA tell the FBI to stop its investigation into the Watergate break-in. This now-infamous ""smoking gun"" tape marked the final breakdown of Nixon's attempted cover-up. Nixon's secret testimony released Tapes reveal Nixon amid Watergate On 27 July, the House Judiciary Committee voted to pass three articles of impeachment - obstruction of justice, misuse of power and contempt of Congress - and sent them to the House for a full vote. But, the vote never occurred. On 8 August, 1974, Nixon announced his resignation. He remains the only US president in history to have done so. Nixon says goodbye to his staff after announcing his resignation ""I have never been a quitter,"" he said in his resignation speech. ""To leave office before my term is completed is abhorrent to every instinct in my body. But as president, I must put the interest of America first."" Vice-President Gerald Ford was sworn in as president and pardoned Nixon for any crimes he had committed while in office. Up for election less than two years later, Ford lost the White House to Democrat Jimmy Carter. What does it take to impeach a president? No contest. It's the Watergate scandal. Though he never admitted to any criminal wrongdoing, his actions remain a cautionary tale of abuse of presidential power. Nixon died in April 1994, 20 years after he resigned in disgrace. Speaking at his funeral, then-President Bill Clinton focused on Nixon's work in foreign affairs. ""Let us say: may the day of judging President Nixon on anything less than his entire life and career come to a close,"" Mr Clinton said. President Clinton addresses the nation after being impeached by the US House of Representatives Just a few years after President Bill Clinton preached forgiveness for Nixon's failings, the Arkansas Democrat was facing his own political crisis. Within one year of taking office, Mr Clinton found himself under investigation by a Justice Department special prosecutor. Under special counsel Kenneth Starr, the scope of the probe into real estate dealings expanded in January 1998 to include the president's affair with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky. The link between Monica Lewinsky and Donald Trump Clinton: 'I acted right' over Lewinsky As part of a separate lawsuit against the president - the sexual harassment of Paula Jones - Mr Clinton was asked about his relationship to Ms Lewinsky. Under oath on 17 January, Mr Clinton denied having a relationship with the former White House aide. Monica Lewinsky agreed to participate in the special counsel investigation into Bill Clinton Days later, Mr Clinton famously doubled down on his denial. ""I want you to listen to me,"" President Clinton said to media at a White House appearance. ""I did not have sex with that woman, Monica Lewinsky. I never told a single person to lie, not a single time, never."" On 9 September 1998, Mr Starr released his report to Congress. The public, too, soon got to see the 445-page Starr report which included salacious testimony from Ms Lewinsky, who had struck an immunity deal with the independent counsel in exchange for her co-operation. The report also included 11 possible grounds for impeachment. In December 1998, the House of Representatives voted along party lines to impeach Mr Clinton on two counts: perjury and obstruction of Congress. In February, Mr Clinton was acquitted by the Republican-controlled Senate. For the year that the Lewinsky-Clinton scandal consumed the country, the president resisted growing calls to resign. It was during this period, at the end of January 1998, that Mr Clinton laid claim to one of his highest-ever opinion poll ratings. In a poll for CNN, Gallup found that 67% of Americans approved of the president. In the end, the only politicians to lose their jobs during the impeachment crisis were Republicans. The Republican plan to ride the scandal to victory in the 1998 midterms backfired: Democrats made gains in both the House and the Senate. Mr Clinton left office in January 2001 with a 65% approval rating - the highest of any of his predecessors in half a century. But his party lost the White House when George W Bush beat Al Gore after a recount in Florida. Depends who you ask but the Monica Lewinsky scandal would be up there for most people as the first thing they think of. The impeachment that followed? Less so. His high popularity ratings throughout the process suggest he was not as damaged by it as the previous two presidents who faced it.

This time around, the president was charged with inciting the riot at the US Capitol last week, which left five people dead. Ten Republicans in the House of Representatives broke party ranks and voted to impeach Trump. It's a marked change from 2019's proceedings when no Republicans voted to impeach. Shortly after the vote, Trump released a video statement condemning last week's violence, but did not mention impeachment. Trump will now face trial in the Senate. This won't happen until after Democrat Joe Biden takes office next week on 20 January. Looking for more? Read more about today's vote here.

Chief Art Acevedo said the officer had been relieved of his duties and notified that he will face a disciplinary hearing. Acevedo said there was a ""high probability"" the officer will face federal charges.

""I have directed federal agencies to use all necessary resources to maintain order in Washington DC,"" Trump says. ""We are bringing in thousands of National Guard members to secure the city and ensure that a transition can occur safely and without incident."" ""Like all of you I was shocked and deeply saddened by the calamity at the Capitol last week. I want to thank the hundreds of millions of incredible American citizens who have responded to this moment with calm moderation."" During his remarks, Trump criticised what he described as an ""assault on free speech"". In recent days, the president's personal accounts have been removed from Twitter, YouTube and Facebook. ""These are tense and difficult times. The efforts to censor, cancel and blacklist our fellow citizens are wrong. ""And they are dangerous. What is needed now is for us to listen to one another. Not to silence one another."" Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi has just signed the article of impeachment against President Trump. Now it's official. She's appeared with the House leaders and impeachment managers - these are the lawmakers who were tasked with presenting the case to the Senate as prosecutors. Senators will then act as jurors during the trial and ultimately decide whether or not to convict the president on the charge. The lead manager is Jamie Raskin. He's joined by Diana DeGette, David Cicilline, Joaquin Castro, Eric Swalwell, Madeleine Dean and Joe Neguse. ""Today the House demonstrated that no one is above the law, not even the president of the United States,"" Pelosi said before signing. ""That Donald Trump is a clear and present danger to the country and that once again we honour that oath of office to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States. ""And now, I sadly and with a heart broken over what this means to our country, of a president who would incite insurrection, will sign the engrossment of the article of impeachment."" President Trump ends with a call for unity. ""All of us can choose by our actions to rise above the rancour and find common ground and shared purpose. We must focus on advancing the interests of the whole nation, delivering the miracle vaccines, defeating the pandemic, rebuilding the economy, protecting our national security and upholding the rule of law,"" he says. ""Today I am calling on all Americans to overcome the passions of the moment, and join together as one American people,"" he says. ""God bless you, and God bless America."" The violence, Trump says, must stop. ""Whether you are on the right, or on the left, a Democrat or a Republican, there is never a justification for violence. No excuses. No exceptions. America is a nation of laws. Those who engaged in the attacks last week will be brought to justice."" Trump refers to the additional protests planned across the US in the coming days, saying he has been briefed by authorities on potential threats. ""Every American deserves to have their voice heard in a respectful and peaceful way. That is your First Amendment right. But I cannot emphasise that there must be no violence, no law breaking, and no vandalism of any kind [sic]. Everyone must follow our laws and obey the instructions of law enforcement."" In a sombre tone addressing his ""fellow Americans"", President Trump says he ""unequivocally"" condemns the violence in America's capital yesterday. ""No true supporter of mine could ever endorse political violence. No true supporter of mine could ever disrespect law enforcement or our great American flag,"" he said. ""If you do any of these things you are not supporting our movement you are attacking it and you are attacking our country. We cannot tolerate it."" It is Trump's strongest statement to date after a mob of his supporters broke into the US Capitol building. Five people died as a result. In a video message posted to the White House's Twitter account, Donald Trump has just condemned the violence in the Capitol last week, saying ""violence and vandalism have absolutely no place in our country and no place in our movement"". He did not make any reference to impeachment. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

President Trump has just become the first sitting president to be impeached twice by the US House of Representatives. Arecent CBS poll,externalshowed a small majority of Americans favoured impeaching Trump. We asked members of our BBC voter panel to weigh in as well. Here's what they said: Everything he has done is unconstitutional and, as a president, the number one thing he should be doing is upholding the Constitution. If not for him continually fighting the election results and claiming the election was stolen, if not for him holding that rally near the Capitol, if not for him talking about 'uprising', last week would very likely not have happened. Unfortunately it was completely predictable. Melissa Dangaran, 51, from Minnesota Unprecedented. He should not have been impeached at all. There is no justification, no legal basis, no constitutional basis for it. It's a rush to judgment for ulterior motives and a dark stain on our country. I'm concerned about the double standard and I'm afraid our Constitution is on its deathbed. Why would anybody who's rational think that our president meant for people to go break into the Capitol? Belinda Noah, 45, from Florida It's more of a symbolic impeachment at this point because he'll be out soon, but it's necessary nonetheless. Not only is he a threat to our national security, but he doesn't condone white supremacy and other threats. It's deeply saddening to me. Williams Morales, 19, from Georgia I was in DC at the rally - not near the Capitol - but I saw the president speak with my own eyes and he did not call for anyone to storm the building or cause harm. It's just a way to ensure he will not run in the next four years. It is political and it will create a bigger divide between left and right. All violence should be condemned fairly and justly. It was a very sad outcome, but I do not believe it was the most horrible day in our country's history. Gabriel Montalvo, 21, from New York Republican pollster Frank Luntz says the most ""amazing statistic"" to him is the fact that half of Trump's voters want him to keep fighting over election 2020. ""They want him to continue to fight right up to the inauguration,"" he told the BBC. He says this passion, even in the face of evidence, explains what happened during the riot last week. Luntz also warns that ""there's a danger that the Republican party actually splits in half"" post-Trump - and as things stands, at the moment, ""there are more people who'd go with Trump"". ""The level of passion among Trump voters has not dissipated,"" he notes. ""They are as loud and as passionate and I believe a whole lot of them are coming to Washington next week for the inauguration and they're not coming to cheer on Joe Biden.""

Trump has made history with his second impeachment. Here's how the moment is being covered, worldwide. Donald Trump is expected to speak tonight, likely sometime in the next 45 minutes. The White House is reportedly still working out where to post the video message, which will come on the heels of his second impeachment. The president's personal accounts have been barred from Twitter, YouTube and Facebook following last week's riots. President Clinton addresses the nation after being impeached by the US House of Representatives When he was first impeached in 2019, President Donald Trump became part of a small group of rebuked US leaders. After today, President Trump is the first president to be impeached twice. Only two other presidents in history have been impeached by the House of Representatives - Andrew Johnson, back in 1868, and Bill Clinton in 1998. Another - Richard Nixon - stepped down and resigned. But to date, no president has ever been removed from the White House by Congress. So what happened to their popularity and the fortunes of their party?Read more here. Â© 2025 BBC.

Trump impeached for 'inciting' US Capitol riotDonald Trump becomes first president in US history to be impeached twice.,"This video can not be played Watch the moment President Trump was impeached for a second time Donald Trump has become the first president in US history to be impeached twice, after being charged with ""incitement of insurrection"" over last week's deadly storming of Congress. The House of Representatives accused Mr Trump of encouraging violence with his false claims of election fraud. He now faces trial in the upper chamber, the Senate, but not before he leaves office next Wednesday. Senators can vote to bar him from ever holding public office again. In a video released after the vote,externalin the House on Wednesday, Mr Trump called on his followers to remain peaceful, without mentioning his impeachment. ""Violence and vandalism have no place in our country... No true supporter of mine would ever endorse political violence,"" he said, striking a sombre and conciliatory tone. 'Symbolic but necessaryâ: US voters react What happens to impeached presidents? Troops keep watch at Capitol, one week after riots The FBI has warned of possible armed protests planned for Washington DC and all 50 US state capitals in the days before Joe Biden, a Democrat, is inaugurated as the new US president. This video can not be played Trump: 'Violence and vandalism have no place in our country' Impeachment charges are political, not criminal. The president was accused by the House of inciting the storming of the Capitol - the seat of the US Congress - with a speech on 6 January to supporters outside the White House. He urged them to ""peacefully and patriotically"" make their voices heard, but also to ""fight like hell"" against an election that he falsely told them had been stolen. Following Mr Trump's remarks, his supporters broke into the Capitol, forcing lawmakers to suspend certification of election results and take shelter. The building was placed on lockdown and five people died in the melee. Did Trump's words at rally incite the riot? A visual guide to the Congress riots Can Trump be removed or banned from politics? The article of impeachment stated that Mr Trump ""repeatedly issued false statements asserting that the presidential election results were fraudulent and should not be accepted"". It says he then repeated these claims and ""wilfully made statements to the crowd that encouraged and foreseeably resulted in lawless action at the Capitol"", leading to the violence and loss of life. ""President Trump gravely endangered the security of the United States and its institutions of government, threatened the integrity of the democratic system, interfered with the peaceful transition of power, and imperilled a coequal branch of government."" Last week, 139 Republicans voted against accepting the result of the 2020 election and Mr Trump's defeat. What is impeachment?Impeachment is when a sitting president is charged with crimes. In this case, President Trump was charged with inciting insurrection by encouraging his supporters to storm the Capitol Could Trump be removed from office?The House of Representatives has impeached him, moving the case to the Senate for a trial. But a trial will not be carried out before Mr Trump leaves office on 20 January So what does it mean?A trial can happen after his term ends, and senators can vote to bar him from holding public office again For two hours on Wednesday, members of the Democratic-controlled House made statements for and against the vote in the same chamber where they hid under chairs and donned gas masks as rioters tried to force their way inside last week. National Guard troops kept watch inside and outside the Capitol. Ten of Mr Trump's Republican party joined Democrats to impeach him by 232-197. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, said on the House floor: ""The president of the United States incited this insurrection, this armed rebellion against our common country. He must go. He is a clear and present danger to the nation that we all love."" Democratic congressman Julian Castro called Mr Trump ""the most dangerous man to ever occupy the Oval Office"". This video can not be played How did Republicans defend Trump - and who voted to impeach? Most Republicans did not seek to defend Mr Trump's rhetoric, instead arguing that the impeachment had bypassed the customary hearings and calling on Democrats to drop it for the sake of national unity. ""Impeaching the president in such a short time frame would be a mistake,"" said Kevin McCarthy, the House's top Republican. ""That doesn't mean the president's free from fault. The president bears responsibility for Wednesday's attack on Congress by mob rioters."" Jim Jordan, an Ohio Republican, accused Democrats of recklessly dividing the country to pursue a political vendetta. ""This is about getting the president of the United States. It's always been about getting the president, no matter what. It's an obsession."" Among members of the president's party who voted to impeach him was the third-ranking House Republican, Liz Cheney. The Wyoming representative, the daughter of former Vice-President Dick Cheney, said of the riot that ""there has never been a greater betrayal by a president"". Donald Trump has made history once again, this time as the first president to be impeached twice. A year ago, the move was opposed in lockstep by the Republican Party. This time, a handful of conservatives backed the move. It is a reflection not only of the gravity of the moment, but also the president's declining influence in the final days of his administration. Impeachment sets up a Senate trial for Mr Trump that now appears destined to stretch into the early days of Joe Biden's presidency, creating yet another challenge for the incoming president. It also will stoke an ongoing debate among Republicans over the direction their party takes in the days ahead. The party is on a path that splits in two very different directions. On one side is continued allegiance to the president's brand of politics - one that created a new coalition of voters that delivered the White House and Congress in 2016, but lost both in 2020. On the other is an uncertain future - but one free from the president's unique style of heat and rhetoric - unfiltered invective that even many Republicans now believe contributed to last week's Capitol riot Read more from Anthony The impeachment article will head to the Senate, which will hold a trial to determine the president's guilt. A two-thirds majority is needed to convict Mr Trump, meaning at least 17 Republicans would have to vote with Democrats in the evenly split, 100-seat chamber. As many as 20 Senate Republicans are open to convicting the president, the New York Times reported on Tuesday. If Mr Trump is convicted by the Senate, lawmakers could hold another vote to block him from running for elected office again - which he has indicated he planned to do in 2024. But the trial will not come during Mr Trump's remaining week in office. Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement: ""Given the rules, procedures, and Senate precedents that govern presidential impeachment trials, there is simply no chance that a fair or serious trial could conclude before President-elect Biden is sworn in next week."" He said it would best serve the interests of the nation if Congress focused on a safe and orderly transition of power for the incoming Biden administration. In a note to colleagues, Mr McConnell also said he had not made a final decision on how he would vote. Mindful that his first days in office could become mired in the impeachment drama, Mr Biden said he hoped senators would not neglect the ""other urgent business of this nation"", such as approving his cabinet nominees, coronavirus relief and the nationwide vaccination programme. However, a Republican congresswoman, Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, announced she would file articles of impeachment against Mr Biden, accusing him of abuse of power, the day after his inauguration. No US president has ever been removed from office through impeachment. Mr Trump was impeached by the House in 2019 over his dealings in Ukraine, but acquitted by the Senate. So was Bill Clinton in 1998 and Andrew Johnson in 1868. At least 10 confirmed dead in Los Angeles wildfires What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

Archbishop of Glasgow dies after contracting Covid,"The Archbishop of Glasgow, the Most Reverend Philip Tartaglia, has died suddenly at his home in the city. He was 70 years old. Archbishop Tartaglia had tested positive for Covid-19 shortly after Christmas and was self-isolating. The Catholic Church said the cause of his death was not yet clear. He was ordained a priest in 1975 and had served as leader of Scotland's largest Catholic community since 2012. A statement from the Archdiocese of Glasgow said: ""It is with the greatest sorrow that we announce the death of our Archbishop. ""The Pope's Ambassador to Great Britain, Archbishop Claudio Gugerotti, has been informed. ""It will be for Pope Francis to appoint a new Archbishop to succeed Archbishop Tartaglia, but until then the Archdiocese will be overseen by an administrator."" Scotland's Catholic bishops described Archbishop Tartaglia as a ""gentle, caring and warm-hearted pastor"". They said in a statement: ""His loss to his family, his clergy and the people of the Archdiocese of Glasgow will be immeasurable but for the entire Church in Scotland this is a day of immense loss and sadness. ""He was a gentle, caring and warm-hearted pastor who combined compassion with a piercing intellect. ""His contribution to the work of the Bishops' Conference of Scotland over the past 16 years was significant and we will miss his wisdom, wit and robust Catholic spirit very much."" Archbishop Tartaglia had been self-isolating at home after contracting coronavirus The statement concluded: ""On behalf of the Bishops of Scotland, we commend his soul into the hands of God and pray that he may enjoy eternal rest.""

First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the archbishop was ""a fine man who was much loved within the Catholic community and beyond"". Ms Sturgeon tweeted,external: ""I always valued my interactions with him and he will be greatly missed. My thoughts are with his loved ones and wider community. May he rest in peace."" The leader of the Scottish Conservatives,Douglas Ross, tweeted,external: ""Tragic news about the sudden passing of Archbishop Philip Tartaglia. My condolences to his friends and family. ""His death will be keenly felt within the Catholic Church and across the wider community."" The leader of Glasgow City Council described the archbishop as ""a true Glaswegian"" who ""knew its people and the challenges faced by ordinary citizens, regardless of their faith or beliefs"". Councillor Susan Aitken added: ""He was also unafraid to use his position to challenge deprivation, austerity and the ill-effects of welfare reform when he believed it was his duty to call them out."" Archbishop Tartaglia was born in Glasgow on 11 January 1951 - the eldest son of Guido and Annita Tartaglia. After attending St Thomas' Primary in Riddrie, he began his secondary education at St Mungo's Academy before moving to the national junior seminary at St Vincent's College, Langbank. He later attended St Mary's College, at Blairs, Aberdeen, before completing his ecclesiastical studies at the Pontifical Scots College, and the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome. On returning to Scotland, he was an assistant and then parish priest at Our Lady of Lourdes, Cardonald, St Patrick's, Dumbarton, and St Mary's, Duntocher. Archbishop Tartaglia was ordained by then Archbishop Thomas Winning in the Church of Our Lady of Good Counsel, Dennistoun, on 30 June 1975. He was a leading opponent of proposals to legalise same-sex marriage in Scotland and also criticised ministers over anti-bigotry legislation. The Archdiocese of Glasgow is the largest of Scotland's eight dioceses with an estimated Catholic population of about 200,000.  It comprises 95 parishes and is served by about 200 priests. Archbishop Tartaglia was the eighth person to hold the office since the restoration of the Catholic hierarchy in Scotland in 1878. He followed Archbishop Mario Conti and Archbishop Thomas Winning, who later became Cardinal Winning.

Did Trump's words at rally incite the riot?,"Donald Trump has been acquitted of a single impeachment charge that he incited a mob to storm the US Capitol. So what did the president say prior to the violence? On 6 January, thousands of Trump supporters gathered at a ""Save America"" rally organised to challenge the result of last November's presidential election. They listened as Mr Trump spoke to them on the National Mall, near the White House in Washington DC. In a 70-minute address, Mr Trump exhorted them to march on Congress where politicians had met to certify Democrat Joe Biden's win. The attack began moments after he took the applause. Those words have now played a central part in his second impeachment, which lawmakers voted in favour of last month. So what did he say? Here are five key quotes, followed by some legal analysis from Professor Garrett Epps of the University of Baltimore. What verdict means for Trump, Biden and America Capitol riots timeline: How the day unfolded This was three minutes into his speech. It was a false assertion that Democrats used as the starting point for the incitement charge - not just because he said it on this day but for weeks before. This quote appears in the article of impeachment, the charge that was backed by the House of Representatives, lower chamber of Congress. In the months preceding the Joint Session, President Trump repeatedly issued false statements asserting that the Presidential election results were the product of widespread fraud and should not be accepted by the American people or certified by State or Federal officials. Shortly before the Joint Session commenced, President Trump, addressed a crowd at the Ellipse in Washington, DC. There, he reiterated false claims that ""we won this election, and we won it by a landslide"". The article has been sent to the Senate, where Mr Trump's trial will begin on Tuesday. Here Trump was echoing the slogan of the movement to fight Mr Biden's election victory, which was started a day after the result was declared. It soon gathered pace on social media and led to rallies across the US. The largest one yet was the one Mr Trump addressed on 6 January. The deep roots of Trumpâs 'voter fraud' strategy This was Mr Trump saying in the clearest terms yet that he will never accept Mr Biden's win. Referring to himself and his supporters collectively, Mr Trump said there would be no concession. He went on: ""You don't concede when there's theft involved. Our country has had enough. We will not take it anymore."" This video can not be played ""We will never give up, we will never concede"", Trump tells supporters At one point, Mr Trump said the Biden presidency had to be challenged. ""You will have an illegitimate president. That is what you will have, and we can't let that happen."" This is the longest quote from Mr Trump's speech that appears in the article of impeachment. It could also be the one that his lawyers will find hardest to defend in the trial. He also wilfully made statements that, in context, encouraged - and foreseeably resulted in - lawless action at the Capitol, such as: ""if you don't fight like hell you're not going to have a country anymore"". However, Mr Trump's lawyers have argued his use of the word ""fight"" was figurative, which has long been accepted in public discourse. This was the part of Mr Trump's speech that his defenders have seized on to show that he never incited the crowd. He said: ""I know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard."" The language was very different from other sections, which borrowed more from combat or war. Indeed, Mr Trump's lawyers have suggested they will highlight his use of the word ""peacefully"" in the trial. The president used ""we"" but he didn't join them as his supporters took the short walk from the rally to Congress. He said: ""We're going to walk down to the Capitol and we're going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women, and we're probably not going to be cheering so much for some of them."" Can Trump be removed or banned from politics? What is incitement under the law? Incitement is not a crime under the First Amendment unless it meets certain criteria. First of all, it has to be intended to cause violence (and you infer that intent from the circumstances). It also has to be likely to cause violence. If I go downtown and I say to two drunks standing in front of a bank, ""let's rob this bank right now"", I haven't really incited anybody, because it's not very likely they'll rob the bank. If I say let's meet here tomorrow and rip things up, I'm not inciting because - in the words of the Supreme Court - where there is time for better counsels to prevail, the remedy for speech is more speech. The speech has to be likely to cause - and this is very important - imminent violent action. If this was a court of law, does Trump cross the line? It's quite rare that somebody can be convicted of incitement. In applying that to the president's speech at the rally, it's an agonisingly close case. It's pretty goddamn imminent because he's telling people to march to the Capitol and I will march with you. There wouldn't be any time for better counsels to prevail because you're just going to leave the Ellipse and walk down Pennsylvania Avenue. He said we have to fight and show strength, but he also said we're very peacefully and patriotically going to ask, so he's covering himself. In the end, I think it's a jury question. I'm not sure he's entitled to a dismissal of charges as a matter of law. There's some discussion that government leaders have more leeway, but I don't know how that would play out. He clearly knew there were people in that crowd who were ready to and intended to be violent, and he certainly did nothing to discourage that. He not only did nothing to discourage it, he strongly hinted it should happen.

Can Trump be removed or banned from politics?,"Donald Trump became the first US president to be impeached twice Former US President Donald Trump is being put on trial by lawmakers for allegedly inciting a riot at the US Capitol. Last month Mr Trump became the first president in US history to be charged with misconduct - or impeached - twice by the lower chamber of Congress. Republicans and Democrats in the House of Representatives voted to pass an article of impeachment that accused Mr Trump of ""incitement of insurrection"". The article alleged that Mr Trump had made false allegations of election fraud and encouraged his supporters to storm Congress on 6 January. Now a trial is being held in the upper chamber of Congress, the Senate, which will decide whether to convict or clear Mr Trump of the charge. This is an unprecedented moment for the US, which has never put an impeached president on trial after they have left office. So, what can we expect? The trial in the Senate is political, rather than criminal. A vote will be held at the end of the trial to determine whether Mr Trump is guilty of the charge. A two-thirds majority of the 100-member Senate must back a guilty verdict to convict Mr Trump. If Mr Trump is convicted, senators could also vote to bar him from ever holding public office again. This video can not be played House delivers impeachment charge against Donald Trump to the Senate The trial opened on Tuesday with a four-hour debate on whether the proceedings were unconstitutional because Mr Trump is no longer president. A 56-44 majority then voted in favour of continuing, with six Republicans backing the measure. Each side will then be given 16 hours in total to make their arguments, and this will be limited to eight hours in any one day. There will be an option to request a debate and a vote on whether witnesses should be called. Both Democrats and Republicans are said to favour a speedy trial, amid an ongoing effort to get President Joe Biden's Covid-19 relief plan approved. It is thought a vote on a conviction could come as early as Monday if no witnesses are called. Democrats prosecuting the case opened the proceedings by showing a dramatic video montage of Mr Trump's 6 January speech and the deadly rioting by some of his supporters. ""That's a high crime and misdemeanour,"" Representative Jamie Raskin of Maryland - who is leading the case - said of the footage. ""If that's not an impeachable offence, then there's no such thing."" They say Mr Trump is ""personally responsible"" for the riot and must be convicted. This video can not be played Jamie Raskin: 'They thought they were going to die' According toa pre-trial legal brief, they will say his repeated refusal to concede the election led to an ""incitement of insurrection against the republic he swore to protect"". Mr Trump's ""statements turned his 'wild' rally on 6 January into a powder keg waiting to blow"", they will argue. Although he is no longer in office, Mr Trump ""must answer comprehensively for his conduct in office from his first day in office through his last"", Democrats argue. They have called for Mr Trump to be disqualified from ever running for office again. On the opening day, his defence lawyers argued unsuccessfully that it was unconstitutional to put a private citizen through the impeachment process. Defence lawyer David Schoen said the Democrats were using ""the guise of impeachment as a tool to disenfranchise"" those who support Donald Trump. His lawyers are now likely to change tack and argue that Mr Trump's supporters stormed Congress of their own accord. This video can not be played Trump's lawyer, David Schoen: 'Overriding emotion is to cry for the US Constitution' According to their own pre-trial brief, they will argue that Mr Trump's pre-riot remarks did not amount to incitement. The former president's call to ""fight"" was not meant to be taken literally, they say. ""To characterise this statement alone as 'incitement to insurrection' is to ignore, wholesale, the remainder of Mr Trump's speech that day, including his call for his supporters to 'peacefully' making their 'voices heard,'"" they add. Moreover, FBI documents had shown that the riot was planned days in advance, the lawyers said. It is never happened before, so it is untested and the US Constitution does not say. Impeachment proceedings against President Richard Nixon were ended when he quit in 1974. So Mr Trump could take his case to the Supreme Court, claiming his trial was unconstitutional. Some lower ranked officials have been impeached after leaving office. What happens to impeached presidents? What impeachment means for Trump, Biden and America That is certainly what prosecutors wanted. Last week, they sent a letter inviting him to testify under oath ""at a mutually convenient time and place"". The prosecution team suggested that they would cite Mr Trump's silence as further proof that their allegations were true. Within hours, however, the former president's lawyers had rejected the request as a publicity stunt. They made clear he would not testify voluntarily. The prosecutors do have the power to issue a subpoena - or an order to compel him to appear in court to testify - but that is considered unlikely. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts presided over the first impeachment trial of Mr Trump, but will not do so again. Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy - third in the line of presidential succession - is presiding over the trial instead. Prosecuting the case are nine House Democrats, known as the impeachment managers. Mr Trump is being represented by two attorneys - Bruce Castor and David Schoen. All 100 US senators have been sworn in as jurors in the trial. Democrats only hold half the 100 seats so they would require 17 Republicans to vote against someone from their own party. That is a high bar for a party that has largely remained publicly loyal to Mr Trump. Ten Republicans in the House supported impeachment and a handful of senators have indicated they are open to it. But Tuesday's vote implied loyalty toward the former president in his party remained high enough to avoid a conviction. At the Capitol: Trump's Christian supporters 'Like a medieval battle': The riots frontline If he is convicted by the Senate, lawmakers must hold another vote to block him from running for elected office again - which he had indicated he planned to do in 2024. This could be the biggest consequence of this impeachment. If he is convicted, a simple majority of senators would be needed to block Mr Trump from holding ""any office of honour, trust or profit under the United States"". So 50 senators plus a casting vote from Vice-President Kamala Harris would be enough to damn Mr Trump's hopes of political power. This could be appealing to Republicans hoping to run for president in the future and those who want Mr Trump out of the party. There has been talk of Mr Trump losing benefits granted to his predecessors under the 1958 Former Presidents Act, which include a pension and health insurance, and potentially a lifetime security detail at taxpayers' expense. However, Mr Trump is likely to keep these benefits if he is convicted after leaving office. That was over his dealings with Ukraine, although he denied any wrongdoing. He was accused of pressing the country's leader to open an investigation into Mr Biden, then his emerging rival for the White House, and his son Hunter. Mr Trump appeared to use military aid as leverage. He was impeached by the House and cleared by the then Republican-controlled Senate. Hang on, why was Trump impeached again?

"UK reports record 1,564 daily Covid deathsThe prime minister warns there is a ""very substantial"" risk of intensive care being ""overtopped"".","A further 1,564 people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive Covid test - the biggest figure reported in a single day since the pandemic began. It brings the total number of deaths by that measure to 84,767. Dr Yvonne Doyle, medical director at Public Health England, said there have now been more deaths in the second wave than the first.

Speaking to the Commons Liaison Committee, Boris Johnson said the situation was ""very, very tough"" in the NHS and the strain on staff was ""colossal"".

Similar measures are in place across much of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. A further 47,525 new caseshave also been recorded.,external Perhaps the most distressing element about the latest Covid deaths is that the numbers are almost certainly going to rise from here. People who are dying now are likely to have been infected three or so weeks ago, around Christmas time. That was at a point when infection rates were rising quite steeply, so in the coming days and weeks we should, sadly, expect to see more deaths than this being reported. Today's figures are affected by the weekend, which sees delays in reporting deaths that tend to translate into higher figures from Tuesday onwards. Currently around 1,000 people a day on average are dying once you take this into account. But the figures also provide some hope. For the third day in a row the number of newly diagnosed infections are well below 50,000. There have been several days where they have exceeded 60,000. If that trend continues, and the number of new cases keeps coming down, that will eventually translate into the number of deaths falling. But it is going to take some weeks for that to happen.

Are we really staying at home?,"Health Secretary Matt Hancock has urged people to ""stay at home and reduce all social contact that is not absolutely necessary"". But are people acting on his advice and how does their behaviour compare with previous lockdowns? People are leaving their homes more than during the first days of the March lockdown, according to data from several sources. Apple, Google and the Department for Transport all collect ""mobility data"". Google does it by recording the location histories on people's mobile devices, while Apple records how many people are asking for directions. The Department for Transport uses different metrics, including traffic cameras and ticket sales. They then take that data and compare how different it is to a national ""baseline"" established in early 2020, before the pandemic started We used the data to look at what it showed for the first Friday of each lockdown in England : lockdown one (which began on 23 March, 2020) lockdown two (which began on 5 November 2020) lockdown three (which began on 5 January 2021) The Google and Department of Transport data covers England, Scotland and Wales, while the Apple data also includes Northern Ireland. We are looking at this data relative to English lockdown rules. This means that in November, during England's second lockdown, the data might be slightly swayed by mobility in other nations with less strict coronavirus restrictions. Both now and in March, all countries had ""stay at home"" rules at the same time. The Department for Transport data shows that trains, buses, the Tube in London and cars are all being used more now than during the first lockdown. Back in March and April 2020, car use dropped to about 35% of pre-pandemic levels. This lockdown, it's around 60% of pre-pandemic levels. The first lockdown saw National Rail and London Underground usage drop to 10% and 6% of its usual traffic alike on the first Friday of the restrictions. This time, they both have around 16% of the usual traffic. Data fromApple's mobility report shows,externalthat on the first Friday of the most recent lockdown, people were driving and walking around at twice the rate of the first lockdown. Public transport use was also higher. Similarly, data fromGoogle gives us more clues,externalabout activity outside the home. Workplaces appear noticeably busier than in the first lockdown but the gap is smaller when it comes to parks and supermarkets. It's worth noting that in both the Google and Apple reports, people appear to be moving around a lot less during lockdown three than in lockdown two in November. Separate data from the route-search app Citymapper shows about twice as many routes were planned in Birmingham, Manchester and London in early January 2021 compared with March 2020. It's important to note that increased levels of activity - compared with the first lockdown - don't necessarily mean more people are flouting the rules. Could I be fined for breaking lockdown rules? Fines 'increasingly likely' for rule-breakers More things are open now compared with March last year, including nurseries, garden centres and estate agents. This could explain why more people are going to work. And while these numbers suggest more movement,the Office for National Statistics' weekly survey,external(conducted over the Christmas period) on attitudes to coronavirus, suggests almost 80% of people in Great Britain still support restrictions. The same survey shows that over the course of the pandemic (even when rules were loosened) around nine in 10 people say they have consistently followed social distancing and contact rules. This survey is regularly updated but has not yet covered the third lockdown. SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? TESTING:How do I get a virus test? SUPPORT BUBBLES:What are they and who can be in yours? TEST AND TRACE:How does it work? But police officers across the country have reported some elements of lockdown fatigue. Paul Netherton, deputy chief constable of Devon and Cornwall Police, told BBC Breakfast: ""I think people are beginning to get fed up with it. I can understand that but we have to be firm, we have to save lives, we have to make sure people are keeping apart, isolating and staying at home."" The Office for National Statistics' survey also notes an increased pessimism - over time - about when the crisis might end. The same ONS survey notes almost a third of people think they do not have enough information from the government to ""manage"" the coronavirus pandemic. And a smaller proportion (12%) say it is difficult to understand the rules. What do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

Your vaccine questions answered,"The government has announced the end of all legal Covid restrictions in England, and Scotland has taken similar steps. Here are some of your questions on the changes: Because your son is in a clinical risk group - and as long as he is over five - he shouldsoon be offered two doses of the Pfizer vaccine. You should be contacted by your GP or specialist team to arrange this. With regard to the dangers of mixing, the UK has also recommended that Covid vaccines are offered to all children aged 5 to 11, not just those at high clinical risk. This is likely to start in England in April. Children are generally at much lower risk of becoming seriously ill from a Covid infection, although some do still get sick and need hospital care. Over-12s can already be vaccinated, and it's hoped that extending the rollout to younger age groups will help protect even more children from the risk of catching and spreading Covid. Schools are expected to work with and support families who have concerns about a pupil returning to the classroom. It is compulsory for school-age children to attend, even if they were previously shielding - the only exception is a small number of children whose clinician or GP has advised them not to attend. If you have concerns about this, you should talk to your doctor. If you live in England and are not in a vulnerable group yourself, it is unlikely that you will be entitled to a free test after 1 April. From that point, lateral flow tests should be available to buy from pharmacies and other retailers. The government says it will continue to provide free tests to the oldest age groups and those most vulnerable to Covid. We don't have the details of how this will work yet, but your mother and her care workers should still be eligible for free tests. Care homes are responsible for their own visiting policies, but at the moment across the UK, all visitors are expected to test for Covid before arrival. The chief scientific adviser Patrick Vallance has warned that further variants of Covid are expected - and that they could be more severe than previous ones. Therefore, although most of the free testing system is being dismantled in England, the government insists that the UK will continue to do detailed checks and surveillance to look for resurgences of Covid and any concerning new variants which may emerge. For example, some people in the community will still be asked to do regular tests for Covid as part of theOffice for National Statisticsâ Infection Survey. Positive test results collected this way can be analysed to identify the type of Covid people have. Throughout the pandemic, scientists have learned a great deal about how to track the virus, and the government says it will be possible to scale up such operations again in the future if necessary. Trials are already underway to test updated vaccines that could be a better match for the virus as it continues to change. The UK government also says it will also help support other countries in developing their own surveillance capabilities, because a new variant can emerge anywhere. NHS England says patients and staff should continue to wear face masks in GP practiceseven though they are no longer mandatory in public places. Face coverings also remain compulsory in healthcare settings in Scotland and Wales, and it is ""strongly advised"" that people wear them in Northern Ireland. Your doctor will be able to advise about what tests you will need before you have an operation. You may need to have a Covid test, and the government has said free testing will still be available in certain settings, such as hospitals. Infection control measures will continue to help keep people safe and limit the spread of the virus. SYMPTOMS:How do I know I've got Covid?

Republicans turn on Trump over impeachment,"This video can not be played President Trump: ""Be careful what you wish for"" The US House of Representatives is deciding whether to impeach President Donald Trump over his role in last week's storming of Congress. Democrats accuse the president of encouraging his supporters to attack the Capitol building. Five people died. Some in Mr Trump's Republican party say they will join Democrats to impeach him on Wednesday, formally charging the president with inciting insurrection. President Trump has rejected any responsibility for the violence. The riot last Wednesday happened after Mr Trump told supporters at a rally in Washington DC to ""fight like hell"" against the result of November's election. As the House continued its debate, Mr Trump responded to the latest reports of planned protests, urging calm. ""I urge that there must be NO violence, NO lawbreaking and NO vandalism of any kind,"" he said in statement released by the White House. ""That is not what I stand for, and it is not what America stands for. ""I call on ALL Americans to help ease tensions and calm tempers. Thank You."" As Democrats hold a majority in the House, the vote is likely to pass. ""We have been asked to turn a blind eye to the criminality, corruption and blatant disregard to the rule of law by the tyrant president we have in the White House,"" Democratic Representative Ilhan Omar said in the House debate. ""We as a nation can no longer look away."" Follow our live updates Can Trump be removed or banned from politics? How many arrests so far from Capitol riots? Did Trump's words at rally incite the riot? At least nine Republicans have voted in favour impeachment, but the majority remain loyal to the president. ""Instead of moving forward as a unifying force, the majority in the House is choosing to divide us further... Let us look forward, not backward. Let us come together, not apart,"" Republican Tom Cole told the House. He was one of 139 Republicans who last week voted against accepting the result of the 2020 election and Mr Trump's defeat. Democratic congresswoman Ilhan Omar called on the House to vote to impeach Mr Trump Once it has passed in the House of Representatives, the impeachment article will then head for the Senate, where a trial will be held to determine the president's guilt. A two-thirds majority would be needed there to convict Mr Trump, meaning at least 17 Republicans would have to vote for conviction. As many as 20 Senate Republicans are open to convicting the president, the New York Times reports. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he had not yet decided whether or not he would vote in favour of impeachment. Mr McConnell has been a key ally for Mr Trump in achieving his legislative agenda and securing a conservative majority on many US courts, including the Supreme Court. The timeline for a potential trial is not clear but it will not finish before Mr Trump leaves office on 20 January, when Joe Biden will be sworn in as president. The Senate will not reconvene this week and probably not until 19 January, according to Mr McConnell's spokesman. The Senate could also use an impeachment trial to block Mr Trump from ever running for office again. He has indicated he plans to campaign for president in 2024. Wednesday's vote means that Mr Trump is likely to become the first US president ever to be impeached twice. In December 2019 he became the third president to be impeached, charged with breaking the law by asking Ukraine to investigate Mr Biden to boost his own chances of re-election. The Senate cleared him. What is impeachment?Impeachment is when a sitting president is charged with crimes. In this case, President Trump is accused of inciting insurrection by encouraging his supporters to storm the Capitol Could Trump be removed from office?A simple majority of the House of Representatives is enough to impeach him - but to remove him from office, he then needs to be convicted of those charges by the Senate, where a two-thirds majority required for conviction is not guaranteed So what does it mean?This is the second time Mr Trump will have been impeached, and even though a trial could begin after his term ends, a conviction could mean he is barred from holding public office again The third most senior Republican in the House, Liz Cheney, has vowed to back impeachment, saying Mr Trump had ""summoned this mob, assembled the mob, and lit the flame of this attack"". ""There has never been a greater betrayal by a president of the United States of his office and his oath to the Constitution,"" said the Wyoming representative, daughter of former Vice-President Dick Cheney. So far, eight more Republicans have voted in favour. Dan Newhouse, a Republican from Washington state, said: ""Turning a blind eye to this brutal assault on our Republic is not an option,external."" This video can not be played A day that shook America House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy, a Trump ally who has said he opposes impeachment, decided not to ask rank-and-file members of the party to vote against the measure, US media reported. According to the New York Times, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell told confidants he was pleased Democrats wanted to impeach the president because he believed it would help rid the Republican party of Mr Trump. On Tuesday, the House passed a resolution calling on Vice-President Mike Pence to help remove Mr Trump using the 25th Amendment - a plan Mr Pence rejected. With just a week left in his term, it now appears all but certain that Donald Trump will become the first president to be impeached twice. Unlike his first go through the process, this vote will have the support of at least a handful of Republicans - including Liz Cheney, a member of the party's House leadership team. There is also, unlike January 2020, a chance the Senate has enough votes to successfully convict the president. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's recent signals of approval are evidence of that. Of course, the primary consequence of Senate conviction - removal from office - seems of limited relevance with so little time left in the Trump presidency. Democrats, however, view impeachment as a formal way of marking their outrage at the president's behaviour, not just last week, but during his months of challenging and undermining November's election results. A successful conviction could also result in Trump's being banned from ever holding federal public office again and stripped of the privileges enjoyed by ex-presidents. That prospect alone, in the minds of Democrats (and, perhaps, some Republicans ready to break with Trumpism), makes impeachment worth the effort.

"UK reports record 1,564 daily Covid deathsThe prime minister warns there is a ""very substantial"" risk of intensive care being ""overtopped"".UK","A further 1,564 people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive Covid test - the biggest figure reported in a single day since the pandemic began. It brings the total number of deaths by that measure to 84,767. Dr Yvonne Doyle, medical director at Public Health England, said there have now been more deaths in the second wave than the first. And the prime minister warned there was a ""very substantial"" risk of intensive care capacity being ""overtopped"". Speaking to the Commons Liaison Committee, Boris Johnson said the situation was ""very, very tough"" in the NHS and the strain on staff was ""colossal"".

Shakira is the latest star to sell her songs,"Shakira is one of the most successful Latin recording artists of all time Shakira has become the latest artist to sell the rights to her music for a multi-million dollar sum. All 145 of her songs, including Hips Don't Lie, Whenever, Wherever and She Wolf, are included in the deal. The songs have made her the best-selling female Latin artist of all time, with 80 million records sold worldwide. The deal was struck with the Hipgnosis Song Fund, which also recently acquired Blondie and Neil Young's music. Shakira: 'I doubted I'd ever sing again' Jennifer Lopez and Shakira sparkle at the Super Bowl Neil Young sells song rights in '$150m' deal Hipgnosis company did not disclose financial details of the sale, but it typically pays the equivalent of 15 years' royalties up front. With tax relief, many walk away with ""about 25 years worth of money in one fell swoop"", the company's founder,Merck Mercuriadis, told the BBC last year. That provides the artists with immediate financial security, while Hipgnosis - which owns the songs in perpetuity - hopes to profit by building new revenue streams for the music via film and TV licensing, merchandise, cover versions and performance royalties. Shakira performed at last year's Super Bowl half-time show Hipgnosis has been on a billion-dollar spending spree over the last few years, snapping up the rights to music by artists like Nile Rodgers, Blondie, Barry Manilow, Chrissie Hynde and Fleetwood Mac's Lindsey Buckingham. Shakira's hits came more recently than those ""legacy"" artists, but she is one of the most successful singer-songwriters of the last 25 years. Since releasing her first album in 1991, at the age of 13, she has sold more than 80 million records, won three Grammy Awards and 12 Latin Grammy Awards. Her first English-language album, Laundry Service, was bought by more than 13 million fans in 2001, while her hit singles include Whenever, Wherever, Underneath Your Clothes, Hips Don't Lie and the 2010 Fifa World Cup song Waka Waka (This Time For Africa), which topped the charts in 15 countries.

The star's most recent album, El Dorado, was certified diamond in the US. She is one of only three female artists to have two videos exceeding two billion views on YouTube. And her latest single, Girl Like Me, has spawned aviral dance craze on Tik Tok,external. Last year, she starred in the Super Bowl half-time show alongside Jennifer Lopez, giving her song catalogue a further boost - and increasing its value to investors. ""She is a superb creator who has led the charge from what was massive physical success to now having bigger success in streaming than most of her contemporaries,"" said Mercuriadis in a statement. ""This is the result of her being a determined force of nature and having written songs the world is incredibly passionate about."" Stevie Nicks recently sold the publishing rights to songs like Dreams, Rhiannon and Edge Of Seventeen Financial security is the obvious reason. Rather than gambling that their songs will continue earn royalties, for the next 25 years, singers like Shakira get a lump sum up-front. Hipgnosis's pitch to musicians is that they are not a traditional publisher, exploiting the rights of a composition, but a ""song management company"" that will ensure an artist's legacy by careful stewardship of their music. After buying a 50% take in Neil Young's catalogue, for example, Mercuriadis promised that the singer's classic track Heart of Gold would never be found on a burger commercial. Why the Church of England co-owns a BeyoncÃ© hit Hipgnosis is not the only company in the game. Earlier this week, investment company KKR (Kohlberg Kravis Roberts) bought the rights to 500 songs written by Ryan Tedder - including tracks like Ed Sheeran's Happier, Camila Cabello's Into It and the Jonas Brothers' Sucker. Bob Dylan recently handed his600-song back catalogueto Universal Music, in a deal that was reported to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars. And the US-based Primary Wave has been buying up the rights to music by Stevie Nicks, Leon Russell, Leo Sayer and soft-rock duo Air Supply. For Shakira, another factor in selling up could be theâ¬14.5m (Â£13m) tax bill,externalshe recently faced from Spanish government. Prince fought to regain control of his masters for much of his career Certainly, a lot of musicians have gone to war over the rights to their music. Paul McCartney famously fell out with Michael Jackson after he bought the rights to the Beatles songs in the 1980s. Prince spent most of the 1990s battling record label Warner Bros over the ownership of his music - even writing the word ""slave"" on his face in protest. And right now, Taylor Swift is busily re-recording all of her first six albums, after the master tapes (i.e. the original recordings) were sold to a private investment company against her will. Swift shares first clip of re-recorded Love Story Someone like Swift is unlikely to sell her publishing rights (which cover the music and lyrics) but other artists will take a different view. Sophisticated buyers work hand-in-hand with musicians, defining how their songs and recordings can (and cannot) be used. And some artists, like Neil Young, have only sold a portion of their rights - meaning they retain a degree of control. Another potential benefit of selling is that, when an artist dies, their music won't be tied up in ugly and lengthy family battles over who will manage their legacy. The singer says she writes music ""to make sense of the world"" In a statement, the Colombian said Hipgnosis would be a ""great home"" for her music, and waxed lyrical about her love of songwriting. ""Being a songwriter is an accomplishment that I consider equal to and perhaps even greater than being a singer and an artist, "" she said. ""At eight years old - long before I sang - I wrote to make sense of the world. Each song is a reflection of the person I was at the time that I wrote it, but once a song is out in the world, it belongs not only to me but to those who appreciate it as well. ""I'm humbled that songwriting has given me the privilege of communicating with others, of being a part of something bigger than myself."" So now you know.

Fraud: 'I'm down as furloughed for a job I quit',"Sally told the BBC she is still waiting for her P45 despite handing in her notice in November Hairdresser Sally had a surprise when she looked at her tax record with HM Revenue and Customs: ""It said I'd still been getting furlough pay from a job I left in November."" She told BBC Radio 5 Live's Wake up to Money: ""That was a revelation - none of it had landed in my bank account."" Hers is among more than 21,000 reports of suspected furlough fraud currently being handled by HMRC. The money is either due to fraudulent claims, or is being paid out in error. The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, commonly called the furlough scheme was launched in March 2020, at the start of the coronavirus crisis, to minimise unemployment. Under the scheme,the government pays 80% of employees' wages up to Â£2,500 a month. The number of tip offs to the taxman has spiralled sincelast April, from 3,000 to 21,378 reports of suspect payments by early January. Sally's former employer told the BBC she did not know Sally had resigned At the peak of its use in early May, the scheme was supporting 8.9 million jobs. It wasextendedin January until the end of April 2021 and now also applies to those who are unable to work due to caring responsibilities, or because they areclinically extremely vulnerable,external. The scheme has been widely supported for its role in supporting employers and jobs during the pandemic, but it has been found to be open to abuse. Tax lawyer Anita Clifford said at the 'extreme end' of furlough fraud were 'dormant companies being resurrected' and 'fake employees' Sally believes her former employer broke the rules after she resigned from the salon last year. She told the BBC she sent her resignation letter and returned her uniform to her employer in the post in November, but ""heard nothing back"". A client later contacted her asking if she was OK, as they had heard she was off work, ""sick"". Sally started to get her paperwork together to register as self-employed but when she opened her online HMRC account, she noticed she was registered as receiving payments equivalent to those she was getting while on furlough - although the money was not reaching her account. She left it a couple of weeks in case her resignation was taking a few weeks to be processed. To date, Sally has still has not received a P45, and says she is still registered as being paid through the furlough scheme. HMRC has called on anyone concerned about suspected abuse of the team to get in touch with the department ""In the middle of the pandemic, where people are losing homes because they can't get any help, I think it's quite sickening,"" she said. ""It's wrong, and it makes a mockery of all those people who are suffering."" The BBC contacted Sally's former employer, who has denied the claims, saying she did not know that Sally had resigned, and had struggled to get in touch with her. Tax barrister, Anita Clifford, from the firm Bright Line Law, said Sally's experience was ""a classic example"". ""Whether it's a mistake, or whether some actors are doing it deliberately, continuing furlough payments for former employees is a classic way of defrauding the system."" HMRC has previously stressed that some employers may accidentally be committing furlough fraud. Ms Clifford told the BBC that she was seeing businesses coming forward, ""worried about the mistakes that they've made"". But she added examples of furlough fraud could be more extreme, where some businesses ""are seeking to claim money for completely fake employees"". ""In time to come, we'll certainly see enforcement activity, and people very worried about being on the receiving end of a criminal prosecution for some of these things. ""Certainly where you have dormant companies being resurrected, in order to claim money from the furlough scheme, you have fake employees... businesses being quite unscrupulous, you're not using the funds to pay salaries, I think those are the businesses you'll eventually see being looked at very seriously for criminal prosecution,"" she said. HMRC told the BBC: ""The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme is part of the collective national effort to protect jobs. This is taxpayers' money and fraudulent claims limit our ability to support people and deprive public services of essential funding.""

Murder accused âkept sex toy burglary trophiesâ,"Libby Squire was not seen alive after travelling to Oak Road playing fields with Pawel Relowicz, a court heard A man accused of raping and murdering a student committed a string of ""sexually motivated"" burglaries in the months before her death, a court has heard. Pawel Relowicz, 26, denies killing Libby Squire and dumping her body. Jurors heard ""trophies"" - underwear and sex toys - stolen from other women were found after his arrest. Prosecutors claim he was ""prowling the streets"" of Hull's student area in search of a victim when he intercepted the ""extremely vulnerable"" Ms Squire. Sheffield Crown Court previously heard the defendant drove Ms Squire - who had earlier been refused entry to a nightclub -to the Oak Road playing fields. Once there, jurors were told, he subjected her to an ""act of sexual violence"" before he disposed of her body in the River Hull. Her remains were found in the Humber Estuary almost seven weeks later. Prosecutor Richard Wright QC said Mr Relowicz would claim Ms Squire had ""instigated consensual sexual intercourse"", and he had left her ""safe and well"" on the fields. Richard Wright QC continued to outline the case against Pawel Relowicz on Wednesday However, Sam Alford, who lives nearby, reported hearing a woman's ""desperate screams"" coming from the direction of the river, the court heard. Prosecutors allege the screams were Ms Squire's and a man seen ""emerging from the darkness"" and fleeing the area was the defendant. ""Libby was never seen again"", Mr Wright told jurors. The screams, and scratches to the defendant's face were evidence Ms Squire had ""fought him off"", the court heard. Mr Wright said the evidence established ""that she was raped by a man whose entire motivation for coming into contact with her that night was to take her away from safety to a remote area well known to him and there to subject her to his uncontrollable sexual urges"". The prosecutor said a pathologist concluded he could not establish how Ms Squire died despite ""an obvious bruise"" to the inside of her right thigh. Mr Wright told jurors a CCTV recording made after the last sighting of Ms Squire showed Mr Relowicz performing a sex act in the middle of a street. A condom found at the scene days later yielded a DNA profile matching the defendant, the court heard. In the year leading up to Ms Squire's disappearance, Mr Relowicz exposed himself to women in public and watched them through windows as they changed or had sex, the court heard. He also ""burgled their homes with the purpose of stealing their underwear and sexual toys or other objects,"" Mr Wright said. University of Hull student Libby Squire was last seen in the early hours of 1 February 2019 Following his arrest on 6 February, Mr Wright said, police recovered the pink holdall ""full of sex toys... and some photographs of young women and several pairs of women's knickers and thongs"". A statement made by Ms Squire's mother, Lisa Squire, was read out in court describing her daughter having battled mental health issues including an eating disorder, self-harming - cutting the top of her arms, legs and chest - and depression. She said her eldest child had been afraid of water since she was young, to the point she would not go near a swimming pool when on holiday. She was also scared of the dark, jurors were told. Statements by Ms Squire's boyfriend Connor James-Pye were also read out, in which he described Libby as being ""a happy drunk"" and that she ""didn't understand moderation"". However, on the night she disappeared, the court heard Ms Squire ""didn't want to go out because she had a lecture the next morning, but she didn't want to let the girls down"". Mr James-Pye last heard from his girlfriend at about 22:30 on 31 January, jurors heard. The trial continues.

Covid patients in hospital now double April's peak,"This video can not be played Covid: A third of hospital beds in Wales are taken by coronavirus patients The number of Covid patients in Wales' hospitals is now more than double the previous peak seen last April. Welsh NHS Chief Executive Andrew Goodall said 2,870 Covid patients were being treated. The effect of lockdown restrictions will take some weeks to be felt, he told coronavirus briefing. There are some signs that coronavirus levels are starting to stabilise, although an official warned rates remained high in parts of north Wales. Dr Goodall told Wednesday's press conference that - at current levels - the NHS would have to make ""some very difficult decisions"" about the services it could provide. It was already the most challenging winter of his career, he said, adding it would be ""a while yet"" before the number of admissions to hospital began to fall. ""The impact of the restrictions, including the lockdown measures, will take some weeks to be felt in the NHS,"" he said. A further 66 peopleare reported to have died in Wales with coronavirus, according to Public Health Wales, along with 1,533 new cases. The number of Covid patients in hospital on 12 January was 2,879, 107 more than the week before. Numbers have been running at record levels It had risen by 17% in the Betsi Cadwaladr heath board and reflects the pressures at Wrexham Maelor Hospital, which suspended routine surgery to cope. Of those in hospital on 12 January, 1,610 were confirmed Covid-19 patients, 195 were suspected of having Covid and 1,074 were recovering from the virus and are too ill to be discharged. This number is by far the highest level we've seen since then - but because recovering patient figures were not reported until the end of May, so it is a little difficult to compare figures with April. Chief Medical Officer Dr Frank Atherton said there were some encouraging signs over the past few days ""that coronavirus is beginning to stabilise in Wales"". There are 410 cases for every 100,000 individuals at the moment, down from about 650 per 100,000 in mid-December, he said. But Dr Atherton struck a cautious tone, saying there were high rates in areas of Wrexham and Flintshire. Covid care home residents and staff sees 78% rise Online education 'patchy and inconsistent' There are now 14 hospitals at level three or four - the two highest levels used by the NHS to measure pressure on services. Three hospitals are at level four. Dr Goodall warned new variants of the coronavirus could lead to further increases in transmission in Wales in the coming weeks. Public Health Wales said at least 30% of recent positive tests in south east Wales are of the new variant, with at least 70% of cases having the variant in north Wales. Dr Goodall said his greatest concern was ""the impact on critical care"" with 150 people now in intensive care units with coronavirus. ""This is the highest level we have seen during the second wave. This is almost our entire non-pandemic critical care capacity,"" he said. The average age of patients in critical care is 59, with almost twice as many men as women. Meanwhile, 186 patients are in field hospitals, with that number increasing, Dr Goodall said. He said staff were ""exhausted"" and sickness levels were higher than normal for this time of year. About 9% were off sick, compared to the usual 5-6%. Close to half of that was due to Covid-19 - either because staff were ill or had to self-isolate. Dr Goodall said it had been a ""constant treadmill"" for staff. The NHS will have to take difficult decisions about the services it provides, Dr Goodall said A senior Welsh doctor said there could be another four-to-five weeks of ""serious issues"" in hospitals. Dr David Bailey, of the British Medical Association, said: ""It's good that the numbers have started to drop, but that's going to take three, four, five weeks to work its way through to the medical workload at the sharp end, in medical units, in emergency admissions and in critical care. ""People stay in critical care for a couple of weeks; you develop a serious illness with Covid maybe 10 days after you start, so all of these things move down the way in terms of when they come through in the health service."" Paul Davies, leader of the Conservatives in the Senedd, said: ""We need to roll out the vaccine as soon as possible because that's the way out of tackling the virus. ""327,000 doses have been received (in Wales) but only 101,000 people have received the vaccine and we are falling behind other parts of the UK."" The Welsh Government has said there has been asignificant accelerationin the roll out. Meanwhile, Wales' Health Minister Vaughan Gething told a Senedd committee NHS bodies would not achieve the efficiency savings of previous years this year or next due to Covid-19. He said it would be ""wholly unrealistic and unfair"" to expect 1% savings ""during the middle of the pandemic"".

There's been a lot of coronavirus news around today - here are some of the main headlines: Jordan has launched a Covid-19 vaccination programme intended
to protect more than 20% of the kingdomâs 10 million population. The government has said the first stage will focus on people
over the age of 60, those with chronic illnesses, and medical personnel. It aims
to administer 5,000 shots a day at 29 centres. Health Minister Nazir Obeidattold the state news agency Petra,externalthat the first day had gone âsmoothlyâ. But the head of the ministryâs epidemics and communicable
diseases department, Wael Hayajneh,urged more people to register for the free vaccines,external, with
only 200,000 reportedly signed up since late December. The government has purchased vaccines produced by Pfizer-BioNTech
and China's Sinopharm. The latter was granted an âemergency licenceâ on Saturday. Jordan has seen a sharp fall in the daily number of new
infections since mid-November, when restrictions that
had been eased during the summer were reintroduced. More than 309,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19
and 4,076 deaths have been reported since the start of the pandemic. There's been focus this week on whether people are adhering to the rules around wearing face coverings in shops. Tesco, Asda and Waitrose have becomethe latest supermarkets to say they will deny entry to shoppers who do not wear face masks,  unless they are medically exempt. It follows a similar move by Morrisons, while Sainsbury's says it will challenge those who flout the rules. So what protection do masks offer, what sort can be worn, and what are the rules across the UK? Read our explainer here The education select committee chairman has asked the PM for the roadmap for reopening schools in England. Robert Halfon asked the prime minister about the mental health and social isolation effects on children being away from schools. Boris Johnson says the lockdown measures âhave got to continue to workâ, after showing âsome early signs of progressâ. But he says it was âfar, far too earlyâ to say that would lead to a relaxation next month. This video can not be played Covid-19: Johnson and Halfon on lockdown effect on children Gavin StampBBC political reporter The UK governmentâs Covid O
committee is expected to discuss the new variant of coronavirus that has
emerged in Brazil tomorrow. The prime minister hinted to MPs that there could be restrictions on travel from Brazil to the UK - but a final decision has not been taken. Speaking to MPs he said: ""We are taking steps to ensure that we do not see
the import of this new variant from Brazil."" The Catholic Archbishop of Glasgow has died after contracting Covid-19 shortly after Christmas. Philip Tartaglia, 70, was one of the most senior figures in the Catholic Church in Scotland. The Church said his cause of death was not yet clear. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she felt ""deep sadness"" to hear of Archbishop Tartaglia's death. She told Scottish Parliament: ""I'm sure that is sadness shared by everybody across this chamber - and to send my deepest condolences to his loved ones and of course everybody in his community."" Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf said he had ""many fond memories"" of conversations he had shared with the archbishop. Philip Tartaglia was born in Glasgow in 1951 and was appointed Archbishop of Glasgow in 2012. He died on 13 January, which is the Feast of St Mungo - the patron saint of Glasgow. More than 9.3 million of Americans have received the first shot of a Covid vaccine The US has been by far the world's worst-hit nation in the pandemic, with Johns Hopkins University reporting late on Tuesday a record 4,470 Covid-related deaths in the past 24 hours. Here are the latest key developments in America on Wednesday:  The US has had more than 22 million confirmed infections since the start of the outbreak, according to Johns Hopkins. The overall Covid-related death toll has now exceeded 380,000, and is closing in fast on the number of American soldiers killed in World War Two, at about 407,000. Doctors' leaders have called for urgent improvements in personal protective equipment for health workers. The British Medical Association isappealing for a higher grade of face maskto guard against coronavirus infection. It says there is 'growing evidence' that the virus is being spread through the air by aerosols. These are tiny virus particles that can build up in stuffy rooms and they have been linked to outbreaks of Covid-19. This follows an open letter from more than 1,500 health professionals for staff on general wards to be given the type of high-quality masks usually only worn in intensive care units. Public Health England (PHE) has issued guidance on what PPE staff in different settings require. It was last updatedin October 2020,external. And you canread our explainer hereon face masks, including what protection they offer, what sort can be worn, and what the rules are across the UK. A highly contagious strain of coronavirus first detected in South Africa has spread to 20 countries, the WHO says The World Health Organisation (WHO) has expressed concern about the spread of new coronavirus variants. A highly infectious strain, which originated in the UK, has now spread to 50 countries and territories, the WHO said. Since the strain was first detected late last year, it has driven a spike in coronavirus infections and deaths linked to the disease in the UK. A strain first identified in South Africa, meanwhile, has spread to 20 other countries, the WHO said. Health experts say both new variants appear to be more transmissible than previous strains but not necessarily any more dangerous. They have also played down the possibility that vaccines will not be as effective against these variants. Still, the increased transmission of these variants is taking its toll. ""Going into a second year of this [pandemic] could even be tougher given some of the transmission dynamics,"" WHO expert Mike Ryan said during an event on social media. There are also concerns about a third new strain the Japanese authorities have identified in four people who are thought to have caught it in Brazil. BBC Radio 5 Live The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has been a major plank of the government's support during the pandemic. Under the furlough scheme, the government pays up to 80% of employees' wages up to Â£2,500. But it has been found to be open to abuse. New figures from HMRC given to BBC Radio 5 Live's Wake Up to Money programme show the department ishandling more than 21,000 reportsof suspected fraudulent use of the furlough scheme, 5,000 of which are under formal investigation. The money is either due to fraudulent claims, or is being paid out in error. The number of tip offs has spiralled sincelast April, from 3,000 to 21,378 reports of suspect payments by early January. HMRC told the BBC: ""This is taxpayers' money and fraudulent claims limit our ability to support people and deprive public services of essential funding."" The DUPâs Ian Paisley has failed to trigger an emergency Commons debate on the discarding of donated kidneys during the coronavirus pandemic.

The Scottish government is acting now because of the strain on the health service. Its experts are warning the NHS could beoverwhelmed even under a 'stay at home' scenario,external. We've already seen two health boards postponing all non-urgent surgical procedures as an increase in Covid cases puts growing pressure on the system. The action from NHS Lanarkshire and NHS Ayrshire and Arran is showing how the numbers of Covid patients in hospital is really starting to impact on wider care. Wards that would usually treat people recovering from hip or knee replacements for example may need to be converted into Covid wards. Theatres, usually busy carrying out multiple routine surgeries will become high dependency or intensive care facilities. When staff need to be redeployed to work with Covid patients, it is not safe to carry out other routine work. These are the difficult choices many health boards will face over the coming weeks. Action required now to deal with this health emergency will have consequences later. Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva The event at Wengen is one of the most prestigious at the Ski World Cup Switzerlandâs iconic Lauberhorn ski race has been cancelled because of rising cases of Covid-19, many of them, Swiss health officials say, spread by one British tourist. The resort of Wengen, where the famous race is held, had recorded no cases of the virus until October, and only ten until mid-December. After that, cases began to shoot up, and, worryingly, sequencing revealed many of them were the new highly infectious variant first detected in the UK. Contact tracers found that 27 of the cases alone could be linked to one British tourist who recently stayed in a Wengen hotel. Wengen desperately tried to save the race, offering to close off the resort to everyone but competitors, and even closing its schools. At first Swiss health officials agreed, but when, at the start of this week yet more Covid-19 cases were recorded, they pulled the emergency brake. Wengen is devastated. The Lauberhorn is not just any race, but one of the top competitions on the Ski World Cup circuit. It is dearly loved by the Swiss, who have watched with delight as some of their own home-grown talent - such as Beat Feuz and Carlo Janka - triumphed there. Rachel SchraerBBC Health Reporter As MPs have been mentioning today - a coronavirus variant has been found circulating in the Amazonas state of Brazil, and was picked up in Japan in travellers from the region. Itâs different from the UK and South African variants, but it contains common mutations - two changes to the virusâ ""spike"" in particular which have been flagged as potentially making the virus more infectious. This is not going to be the last mutation we hear about. At the moment changes are mainly being picked up in areas that do lots of genetic tracking of the virus - itâs almost certain there are other mutations already circulating unseen in other parts of the world. And the virus will continue to mutate - itâs just a question of how, how much and how fast. For now thereâs no evidence the virus is becoming more dangerous - but if more people catch it then, left unchecked, more will potentially become ill or die. But the vaccines, which target several different areas of the virusâ spike, should still work - though thatâs something that scientists the world over will be monitoring very closely. There have now been more deaths in the second wave of the pandemic than the first, Public Health England's medical director has said. Dr Yvonne Doyle was reacting to the new record of 1,564 deaths within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus in the UK that have been announced this hour. She said: âWith each passing day, more and more people are tragically losing their lives to this terrible virus, and today we have reported the highest number of deaths on a single day since the pandemic began. ""There have now been more deaths in the second wave than the first. âAbout one-in-three people with Covid-19 donât show symptoms, but can still pass it on to others so it is essential that we stay at home, minimise contact with other people and act as if you have the virus.â Labour's chair of the Home Affairs Committee Yvette Cooper, points out loopholes for travellers arriving home from abroad - including travelling on UK public transport when coming back from a holiday destination. Mr Johnson says there is a ""balanced approach"" from the government on the health of the nation vs the health of the economy. Ms Cooper says other countries brought in negative Covid tests as a requirement to travel ""months ago"" whereas the UK is only bringing these in from Friday. Mr Johnson says 3.5m passengers have been spot-checked since June 2020. He says a ""great deal of work"" goes into checking ""passenger data forms"" to check where people have come from. Ms Cooper says over 90% of those passenger data forms are not being checked. She says these checks ""might as well be voluntary"". Mr Johnson replies that those arriving from abroad are being screened. Ms Cooper asks why people from Brazil are not being checked for Covid, considering that there is a new strain in the South American country which could undermine the UK's vaccination programme. ""We are taking steps to ensure"" that the UK doesn't see the new variant in Brazil coming to the UK, replies Mr Johnson. Caroline Nokes, who chairs Parliament's Women and Equalities Commitee, then asks the PM about access to healthcare during the pandemic. She says the evidence shows it is women who are finding accessing services difficult, referring to a constituent who said her surgery was not currently doing smear tests. Nokes asks the PM what is an acceptable wait for a smear test? The PM says he sympathises with anybody who has had their treatment delayed. ""Sadly, that's what we are seeing. We're seeing delays in cancer, we're seeing delays in smear tests and vital services that people need, and that's a result in the increase in the numbers of Covid patients and that's why we have to work flat out to get the virus under control and reduce the current wave and give people the service we need."" Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Perhaps the most distressing element about the latest Covid deaths is that the numbers are almost certainly going to rise from here. People who are dying now are likely to have been infected around three weeks ago. That was at a point when infection rates were rising quite steeply, so in the coming days and weeks we should, sadly, expect to see more deaths than this. Todayâs figures are affected by the weekend, which sees delays reporting deaths that tend to translate into higher figures from Tuesday onwards. Currently around 800 to 900 people a day on average are dying once you take this into account. But the figures also provide some hope. For the third day, in a row the number of newly diagnosed infections are well below 50,000. There had been several days where they have exceeded 60,000. If that trend continues, and the number of new cases keeps coming down, that will eventually translate into the number of deaths falling. But it is going to take some weeks for that to happen. These are, as many have been saying, the darkest days of the pandemic so far. Caroline Nokes, who chairs Parliament's Women and Equalities Committee, asks the PM what additional protections are being put in place to help victims of domestic abuse who have insecure immigration status. The PM says the government has done ""what we can"" since the start of the pandemic to encourage victims of domestic abuse to come forward, including setting up helplines and investing in independent domestic abuse advisers. He says lockdown rules don't apply to victims of domestic abuse. Nokes follows up by asking why a better job is not being done of explaining lockdown rules to vulnerable people - for example, those who rely on British Sign Language or who might have learning difficulties. The PM says he has been asked a couple of times about sign language in particular, and he is going to ""take that away and see what we can do to increase sign language"". He adds that campaigns the government have produced are available in accessible formats and translations. Â© 2025 BBC.

Dealer's last Nazi-looted work returned to ownersThe last of 14 works identified as looted from Jewish collectors is returned to the owner's heirs.Europe,"Many of the works in Gurlitt's collection were in poor condition when they were discovered in 2012 (file photo) When a trove of 1,500 artworks hoarded by the son of a Nazi-era art dealer was discovered in 2012, an investigation began to find out how many were looted from Jewish owners. Eventually only 14 were conclusively identified as looted, and now Germany has declared the last of those works has been returned to the owner's heirs. Das Klavierspiel (Playing the Piano) by Carl Spitzweg was owned by music publisher Henri Hinrichsen. He was murdered at Auschwitz in 1942. German Culture Minister Monika GrÃ¼tters said the return of the work sent an ""important signal"", and that while it could not make up for the deep suffering, it could ""make a contribution to historical justice and fulfil our moral responsibility"". The 19th-Century work by Spitzweg was confiscated by the Nazis in 1939, the same year that Hinrichsen had bought it. Das Klavierspiel by Carl Spitzweg was seized by the Nazis in 1939 It was bought in 1940 by Hildebrand Gurlitt, a Nazi-era dealer who had been given the task by Adolf Hitler of dealing in art seized from Jewish collectors and of buying up so-called ""degenerate art"" removed from museums for a planned FÃ¼hrermuseum in the Austrian city of Linz. The money for the Spitzweg work was paid into a blocked account, so Hinrichsen would never have received it. In 2015, the piece was identified as looted, and it was handed over to the auctioneers Christie's on Tuesday, according to the wishes of Hinrichsen's heirs. In pictures: Nazi art trove on display One lonely man and his hoard of Nazi art Swiss museum to accept 'Nazi art' Although his collection of 1,500 works, plundered from museums as well as individuals, was initially confiscated after the war by the Allies, Hildebrand Gurlitt eventually managed to get it back. Gurlitt died in the 1950s and when German authorities approached his widow in 1961 in search of part of his collection, she claimed the works had been destroyed at the end of World War Two by Allied bombing. This video can not be played The BBC's Stephen Evans was granted exclusive access to look at some of the long-lost masterpieces in 2014 It was only when tax investigators searched the Munich flat of his son Cornelius Gurlitt in 2012 that they found more than 1,400 of the works. Another 60 pieces were discovered at his Austrian home in Salzburg the following year. The son died in 2014 with questions still hanging over the ownership of the collection - as he was protected by a statute of limitations. A court ruled that the works could be bequeathed to the Museum of Fine Arts in the Swiss capital Bern, as Cornelius Gurlitt had requested. While some of the works were deemed to belong to the family, the German Lost Art Foundation then tried to find out, with the Swiss museum, who were the rightful owners of the rest. Fourteen pieces have now conclusively identified as belonging to Jewish owners and returned.

Johnson: 24-7 vaccine hubs as soon as supply allows,"Covid vaccinations will be offered 24 hours a day, seven days a week as soon as supply allows, Boris Johnson says. The prime minister said the plan was to extend opening hours of vaccination centres - at the moment, most sites run from 08:00 to 22:00. The 24-7 service will be piloted in a small number of places first - with NHS staff likely to be offered the option of overnight vaccinations first. But Mr Johnson said supply was the limiting factor at the moment. The NHS had just over a million doses available last week and used up most of them. This week, there are thought to be more but not yet enough to vaccinate two million people - the weekly target the government is aiming to reach in the coming weeks. How will the UK jab millions of people? Can we really jab our way out of lockdown? Covid vaccine: When will you be eligible? At Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Johnson said there would be 24-7 vaccination ""as soon as possible"". The UK has access to two vaccines at the moment - the Pfizer-BioNTech jab and another produced in partnership by Oxford University and AstraZeneca. A third vaccine made by the US company Moderna has been approved but is not yet available to the UK. Mr Johnson praised the work of the more than 200 hospitals and 1,000 GP-led NHS vaccination sites running at the moment. ""They are going exceptionally fast,"" he added. By the end of Monday, 2.4 million people had received their first vaccine dose. The government has promised all the over-70s, the extremely clinically vulnerable and front-line health and care workers - about 15 million people - will be offered a jab by mid February. There is actually enough vaccine in the country to vaccinate all the highest at-risk groups. The problem is that not all of it has been packaged into vials or passed through the final safety checks. There should soon be two million doses available each week for the NHS to use. But the key question once that is achieved is how quickly and by how much supply can increase from there. To make full use of the network of vaccination centres - the ambition is to have 2,700 up and running - many millions of doses will be needed each week. There is huge global demand for these vaccines. And while the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab is made in the UK, the Pfizer-BioNTech one is made abroad as is the Moderna vaccine. Supplies of the latter are not expected until the spring. This is an issue the government is likely to be grappling with for some time. But despite the concerns, it should also be recognised the UK has been quick out of the blocks. Only two countries have vaccinated a larger proportion of the population than the UK. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said it was vital the government moved quickly. Speaking about the planned 24-7 vaccination, he said: ""I obviously welcome that and urge the prime minister and the government to get on with this."" Meanwhile, Nadhim Zahawi, the minister in charge of the vaccination programme, was also asked about supply, at an appearance before the Science and Technology Committee. He said he had a ""clear line of sight"" for the expected numbers that would be available to the NHS for the next few months but refused to give any more detail. ""The more we show off about how many vaccine batches we're receiving, the more difficult life becomes for the manufacturers,"" he said. AstraZeneca vice president Sir Mene Pangalos said one of the issues the firm was facing was that infections among staff had begun to hinder production. ""I feel that it is critical that those who are working on vaccines are immunised because if you have an outbreak at one of the centres, which we've had actually or in one of the groups in Oxford that's working on new variants, or those working on the regulatory files everything stops.""

"Covid patients in hospital now double April's peakNHS boss Andrew Goodall says there are now 2,870 Covid patients in Wales' hospitals.Wales politics","This video can not be played Covid: A third of hospital beds in Wales are taken by coronavirus patients The number of Covid patients in Wales' hospitals is now more than double the previous peak seen last April. Welsh NHS Chief Executive Andrew Goodall said 2,870 Covid patients were being treated. The effect of lockdown restrictions will take some weeks to be felt, he told coronavirus briefing. There are some signs that coronavirus levels are starting to stabilise, although an official warned rates remained high in parts of north Wales. Dr Goodall told Wednesday's press conference that - at current levels - the NHS would have to make ""some very difficult decisions"" about the services it could provide. It was already the most challenging winter of his career, he said, adding it would be ""a while yet"" before the number of admissions to hospital began to fall. ""The impact of the restrictions, including the lockdown measures, will take some weeks to be felt in the NHS,"" he said. A further 66 peopleare reported to have died in Wales with coronavirus, according to Public Health Wales, along with 1,533 new cases. The number of Covid patients in hospital on 12 January was 2,879, 107 more than the week before. Numbers have been running at record levels It had risen by 17% in the Betsi Cadwaladr heath board and reflects the pressures at Wrexham Maelor Hospital, which suspended routine surgery to cope. Of those in hospital on 12 January, 1,610 were confirmed Covid-19 patients, 195 were suspected of having Covid and 1,074 were recovering from the virus and are too ill to be discharged. This number is by far the highest level we've seen since then - but because recovering patient figures were not reported until the end of May, so it is a little difficult to compare figures with April. Chief Medical Officer Dr Frank Atherton said there were some encouraging signs over the past few days ""that coronavirus is beginning to stabilise in Wales"". There are 410 cases for every 100,000 individuals at the moment, down from about 650 per 100,000 in mid-December, he said. But Dr Atherton struck a cautious tone, saying there were high rates in areas of Wrexham and Flintshire. Covid care home residents and staff sees 78% rise Online education 'patchy and inconsistent' There are now 14 hospitals at level three or four - the two highest levels used by the NHS to measure pressure on services. Three hospitals are at level four. Dr Goodall warned new variants of the coronavirus could lead to further increases in transmission in Wales in the coming weeks. Public Health Wales said at least 30% of recent positive tests in south east Wales are of the new variant, with at least 70% of cases having the variant in north Wales. Dr Goodall said his greatest concern was ""the impact on critical care"" with 150 people now in intensive care units with coronavirus. ""This is the highest level we have seen during the second wave. This is almost our entire non-pandemic critical care capacity,"" he said. The average age of patients in critical care is 59, with almost twice as many men as women. Meanwhile, 186 patients are in field hospitals, with that number increasing, Dr Goodall said. He said staff were ""exhausted"" and sickness levels were higher than normal for this time of year. About 9% were off sick, compared to the usual 5-6%. Close to half of that was due to Covid-19 - either because staff were ill or had to self-isolate. Dr Goodall said it had been a ""constant treadmill"" for staff. The NHS will have to take difficult decisions about the services it provides, Dr Goodall said A senior Welsh doctor said there could be another four-to-five weeks of ""serious issues"" in hospitals. Dr David Bailey, of the British Medical Association, said: ""It's good that the numbers have started to drop, but that's going to take three, four, five weeks to work its way through to the medical workload at the sharp end, in medical units, in emergency admissions and in critical care. ""People stay in critical care for a couple of weeks; you develop a serious illness with Covid maybe 10 days after you start, so all of these things move down the way in terms of when they come through in the health service."" Paul Davies, leader of the Conservatives in the Senedd, said: ""We need to roll out the vaccine as soon as possible because that's the way out of tackling the virus. ""327,000 doses have been received (in Wales) but only 101,000 people have received the vaccine and we are falling behind other parts of the UK."" The Welsh Government has said there has been asignificant accelerationin the roll out. Meanwhile, Wales' Health Minister Vaughan Gething told a Senedd committee NHS bodies would not achieve the efficiency savings of previous years this year or next due to Covid-19. He said it would be ""wholly unrealistic and unfair"" to expect 1% savings ""during the middle of the pandemic"".

There's been a lot of coronavirus news around today - here are some of the main headlines: Jordan has launched a Covid-19 vaccination programme intended
to protect more than 20% of the kingdomâs 10 million population. The government has said the first stage will focus on people
over the age of 60, those with chronic illnesses, and medical personnel. It aims
to administer 5,000 shots a day at 29 centres. Health Minister Nazir Obeidattold the state news agency Petra,externalthat the first day had gone âsmoothlyâ. But the head of the ministryâs epidemics and communicable
diseases department, Wael Hayajneh,urged more people to register for the free vaccines,external, with
only 200,000 reportedly signed up since late December. The government has purchased vaccines produced by Pfizer-BioNTech
and China's Sinopharm. The latter was granted an âemergency licenceâ on Saturday. Jordan has seen a sharp fall in the daily number of new
infections since mid-November, when restrictions that
had been eased during the summer were reintroduced. More than 309,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19
and 4,076 deaths have been reported since the start of the pandemic. There's been focus this week on whether people are adhering to the rules around wearing face coverings in shops. Tesco, Asda and Waitrose have becomethe latest supermarkets to say they will deny entry to shoppers who do not wear face masks,  unless they are medically exempt. It follows a similar move by Morrisons, while Sainsbury's says it will challenge those who flout the rules. So what protection do masks offer, what sort can be worn, and what are the rules across the UK? Read our explainer here The education select committee chairman has asked the PM for the roadmap for reopening schools in England. Robert Halfon asked the prime minister about the mental health and social isolation effects on children being away from schools. Boris Johnson says the lockdown measures âhave got to continue to workâ, after showing âsome early signs of progressâ. But he says it was âfar, far too earlyâ to say that would lead to a relaxation next month. This video can not be played Covid-19: Johnson and Halfon on lockdown effect on children Gavin StampBBC political reporter The UK governmentâs Covid O
committee is expected to discuss the new variant of coronavirus that has
emerged in Brazil tomorrow. The prime minister hinted to MPs that there could be restrictions on travel from Brazil to the UK - but a final decision has not been taken. Speaking to MPs he said: ""We are taking steps to ensure that we do not see
the import of this new variant from Brazil."" The Catholic Archbishop of Glasgow has died after contracting Covid-19 shortly after Christmas. Philip Tartaglia, 70, was one of the most senior figures in the Catholic Church in Scotland. The Church said his cause of death was not yet clear. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she felt ""deep sadness"" to hear of Archbishop Tartaglia's death. She told Scottish Parliament: ""I'm sure that is sadness shared by everybody across this chamber - and to send my deepest condolences to his loved ones and of course everybody in his community."" Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf said he had ""many fond memories"" of conversations he had shared with the archbishop. Philip Tartaglia was born in Glasgow in 1951 and was appointed Archbishop of Glasgow in 2012. He died on 13 January, which is the Feast of St Mungo - the patron saint of Glasgow. More than 9.3 million of Americans have received the first shot of a Covid vaccine The US has been by far the world's worst-hit nation in the pandemic, with Johns Hopkins University reporting late on Tuesday a record 4,470 Covid-related deaths in the past 24 hours. Here are the latest key developments in America on Wednesday:  The US has had more than 22 million confirmed infections since the start of the outbreak, according to Johns Hopkins. The overall Covid-related death toll has now exceeded 380,000, and is closing in fast on the number of American soldiers killed in World War Two, at about 407,000. Doctors' leaders have called for urgent improvements in personal protective equipment for health workers. The British Medical Association isappealing for a higher grade of face maskto guard against coronavirus infection. It says there is 'growing evidence' that the virus is being spread through the air by aerosols. These are tiny virus particles that can build up in stuffy rooms and they have been linked to outbreaks of Covid-19. This follows an open letter from more than 1,500 health professionals for staff on general wards to be given the type of high-quality masks usually only worn in intensive care units. Public Health England (PHE) has issued guidance on what PPE staff in different settings require. It was last updatedin October 2020,external. And you canread our explainer hereon face masks, including what protection they offer, what sort can be worn, and what the rules are across the UK. A highly contagious strain of coronavirus first detected in South Africa has spread to 20 countries, the WHO says The World Health Organisation (WHO) has expressed concern about the spread of new coronavirus variants. A highly infectious strain, which originated in the UK, has now spread to 50 countries and territories, the WHO said. Since the strain was first detected late last year, it has driven a spike in coronavirus infections and deaths linked to the disease in the UK. A strain first identified in South Africa, meanwhile, has spread to 20 other countries, the WHO said. Health experts say both new variants appear to be more transmissible than previous strains but not necessarily any more dangerous. They have also played down the possibility that vaccines will not be as effective against these variants. Still, the increased transmission of these variants is taking its toll. ""Going into a second year of this [pandemic] could even be tougher given some of the transmission dynamics,"" WHO expert Mike Ryan said during an event on social media. There are also concerns about a third new strain the Japanese authorities have identified in four people who are thought to have caught it in Brazil. BBC Radio 5 Live The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has been a major plank of the government's support during the pandemic. Under the furlough scheme, the government pays up to 80% of employees' wages up to Â£2,500. But it has been found to be open to abuse. New figures from HMRC given to BBC Radio 5 Live's Wake Up to Money programme show the department ishandling more than 21,000 reportsof suspected fraudulent use of the furlough scheme, 5,000 of which are under formal investigation. The money is either due to fraudulent claims, or is being paid out in error. The number of tip offs has spiralled sincelast April, from 3,000 to 21,378 reports of suspect payments by early January. HMRC told the BBC: ""This is taxpayers' money and fraudulent claims limit our ability to support people and deprive public services of essential funding."" The DUPâs Ian Paisley has failed to trigger an emergency Commons debate on the discarding of donated kidneys during the coronavirus pandemic.

Wards that would usually treat people recovering from hip or knee replacements for example may need to be converted into Covid wards. Theatres, usually busy carrying out multiple routine surgeries will become high dependency or intensive care facilities.

Action required now to deal with this health emergency will have consequences later. Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva The event at Wengen is one of the most prestigious at the Ski World Cup Switzerlandâs iconic Lauberhorn ski race has been cancelled because of rising cases of Covid-19, many of them, Swiss health officials say, spread by one British tourist. The resort of Wengen, where the famous race is held, had recorded no cases of the virus until October, and only ten until mid-December. After that, cases began to shoot up, and, worryingly, sequencing revealed many of them were the new highly infectious variant first detected in the UK. Contact tracers found that 27 of the cases alone could be linked to one British tourist who recently stayed in a Wengen hotel. Wengen desperately tried to save the race, offering to close off the resort to everyone but competitors, and even closing its schools. At first Swiss health officials agreed, but when, at the start of this week yet more Covid-19 cases were recorded, they pulled the emergency brake. Wengen is devastated. The Lauberhorn is not just any race, but one of the top competitions on the Ski World Cup circuit. It is dearly loved by the Swiss, who have watched with delight as some of their own home-grown talent - such as Beat Feuz and Carlo Janka - triumphed there. Rachel SchraerBBC Health Reporter As MPs have been mentioning today - a coronavirus variant has been found circulating in the Amazonas state of Brazil, and was picked up in Japan in travellers from the region. Itâs different from the UK and South African variants, but it contains common mutations - two changes to the virusâ ""spike"" in particular which have been flagged as potentially making the virus more infectious. This is not going to be the last mutation we hear about. At the moment changes are mainly being picked up in areas that do lots of genetic tracking of the virus - itâs almost certain there are other mutations already circulating unseen in other parts of the world. And the virus will continue to mutate - itâs just a question of how, how much and how fast. For now thereâs no evidence the virus is becoming more dangerous - but if more people catch it then, left unchecked, more will potentially become ill or die. But the vaccines, which target several different areas of the virusâ spike, should still work - though thatâs something that scientists the world over will be monitoring very closely. There have now been more deaths in the second wave of the pandemic than the first, Public Health England's medical director has said. Dr Yvonne Doyle was reacting to the new record of 1,564 deaths within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus in the UK that have been announced this hour. She said: âWith each passing day, more and more people are tragically losing their lives to this terrible virus, and today we have reported the highest number of deaths on a single day since the pandemic began. ""There have now been more deaths in the second wave than the first. âAbout one-in-three people with Covid-19 donât show symptoms, but can still pass it on to others so it is essential that we stay at home, minimise contact with other people and act as if you have the virus.â Labour's chair of the Home Affairs Committee Yvette Cooper, points out loopholes for travellers arriving home from abroad - including travelling on UK public transport when coming back from a holiday destination. Mr Johnson says there is a ""balanced approach"" from the government on the health of the nation vs the health of the economy. Ms Cooper says other countries brought in negative Covid tests as a requirement to travel ""months ago"" whereas the UK is only bringing these in from Friday. Mr Johnson says 3.5m passengers have been spot-checked since June 2020. He says a ""great deal of work"" goes into checking ""passenger data forms"" to check where people have come from. Ms Cooper says over 90% of those passenger data forms are not being checked. She says these checks ""might as well be voluntary"". Mr Johnson replies that those arriving from abroad are being screened. Ms Cooper asks why people from Brazil are not being checked for Covid, considering that there is a new strain in the South American country which could undermine the UK's vaccination programme. ""We are taking steps to ensure"" that the UK doesn't see the new variant in Brazil coming to the UK, replies Mr Johnson. Caroline Nokes, who chairs Parliament's Women and Equalities Commitee, then asks the PM about access to healthcare during the pandemic. She says the evidence shows it is women who are finding accessing services difficult, referring to a constituent who said her surgery was not currently doing smear tests. Nokes asks the PM what is an acceptable wait for a smear test? The PM says he sympathises with anybody who has had their treatment delayed. ""Sadly, that's what we are seeing. We're seeing delays in cancer, we're seeing delays in smear tests and vital services that people need, and that's a result in the increase in the numbers of Covid patients and that's why we have to work flat out to get the virus under control and reduce the current wave and give people the service we need."" Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Perhaps the most distressing element about the latest Covid deaths is that the numbers are almost certainly going to rise from here. People who are dying now are likely to have been infected around three weeks ago. That was at a point when infection rates were rising quite steeply, so in the coming days and weeks we should, sadly, expect to see more deaths than this. Todayâs figures are affected by the weekend, which sees delays reporting deaths that tend to translate into higher figures from Tuesday onwards. Currently around 800 to 900 people a day on average are dying once you take this into account. But the figures also provide some hope. For the third day, in a row the number of newly diagnosed infections are well below 50,000. There had been several days where they have exceeded 60,000. If that trend continues, and the number of new cases keeps coming down, that will eventually translate into the number of deaths falling. But it is going to take some weeks for that to happen. These are, as many have been saying, the darkest days of the pandemic so far. Caroline Nokes, who chairs Parliament's Women and Equalities Committee, asks the PM what additional protections are being put in place to help victims of domestic abuse who have insecure immigration status. The PM says the government has done ""what we can"" since the start of the pandemic to encourage victims of domestic abuse to come forward, including setting up helplines and investing in independent domestic abuse advisers. He says lockdown rules don't apply to victims of domestic abuse. Nokes follows up by asking why a better job is not being done of explaining lockdown rules to vulnerable people - for example, those who rely on British Sign Language or who might have learning difficulties. The PM says he has been asked a couple of times about sign language in particular, and he is going to ""take that away and see what we can do to increase sign language"". He adds that campaigns the government have produced are available in accessible formats and translations. Â© 2025 BBC.

There's been a lot of coronavirus news around today - here are some of the main headlines: Jordan has launched a Covid-19 vaccination programme intended
to protect more than 20% of the kingdomâs 10 million population. The government has said the first stage will focus on people
over the age of 60, those with chronic illnesses, and medical personnel. It aims
to administer 5,000 shots a day at 29 centres. Health Minister Nazir Obeidattold the state news agency Petra,externalthat the first day had gone âsmoothlyâ. But the head of the ministryâs epidemics and communicable
diseases department, Wael Hayajneh,urged more people to register for the free vaccines,external, with
only 200,000 reportedly signed up since late December. The government has purchased vaccines produced by Pfizer-BioNTech
and China's Sinopharm. The latter was granted an âemergency licenceâ on Saturday. Jordan has seen a sharp fall in the daily number of new
infections since mid-November, when restrictions that
had been eased during the summer were reintroduced. More than 309,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19
and 4,076 deaths have been reported since the start of the pandemic. There's been focus this week on whether people are adhering to the rules around wearing face coverings in shops. Tesco, Asda and Waitrose have becomethe latest supermarkets to say they will deny entry to shoppers who do not wear face masks,  unless they are medically exempt. It follows a similar move by Morrisons, while Sainsbury's says it will challenge those who flout the rules. So what protection do masks offer, what sort can be worn, and what are the rules across the UK? Read our explainer here The education select committee chairman has asked the PM for the roadmap for reopening schools in England. Robert Halfon asked the prime minister about the mental health and social isolation effects on children being away from schools. Boris Johnson says the lockdown measures âhave got to continue to workâ, after showing âsome early signs of progressâ. But he says it was âfar, far too earlyâ to say that would lead to a relaxation next month. This video can not be played Covid-19: Johnson and Halfon on lockdown effect on children Gavin StampBBC political reporter The UK governmentâs Covid O
committee is expected to discuss the new variant of coronavirus that has
emerged in Brazil tomorrow. The prime minister hinted to MPs that there could be restrictions on travel from Brazil to the UK - but a final decision has not been taken. Speaking to MPs he said: ""We are taking steps to ensure that we do not see
the import of this new variant from Brazil."" The Catholic Archbishop of Glasgow has died after contracting Covid-19 shortly after Christmas. Philip Tartaglia, 70, was one of the most senior figures in the Catholic Church in Scotland. The Church said his cause of death was not yet clear. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she felt ""deep sadness"" to hear of Archbishop Tartaglia's death. She told Scottish Parliament: ""I'm sure that is sadness shared by everybody across this chamber - and to send my deepest condolences to his loved ones and of course everybody in his community."" Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf said he had ""many fond memories"" of conversations he had shared with the archbishop. Philip Tartaglia was born in Glasgow in 1951 and was appointed Archbishop of Glasgow in 2012. He died on 13 January, which is the Feast of St Mungo - the patron saint of Glasgow. More than 9.3 million of Americans have received the first shot of a Covid vaccine The US has been by far the world's worst-hit nation in the pandemic, with Johns Hopkins University reporting late on Tuesday a record 4,470 Covid-related deaths in the past 24 hours. Here are the latest key developments in America on Wednesday:  The US has had more than 22 million confirmed infections since the start of the outbreak, according to Johns Hopkins. The overall Covid-related death toll has now exceeded 380,000, and is closing in fast on the number of American soldiers killed in World War Two, at about 407,000. Doctors' leaders have called for urgent improvements in personal protective equipment for health workers. The British Medical Association isappealing for a higher grade of face maskto guard against coronavirus infection. It says there is 'growing evidence' that the virus is being spread through the air by aerosols. These are tiny virus particles that can build up in stuffy rooms and they have been linked to outbreaks of Covid-19. This follows an open letter from more than 1,500 health professionals for staff on general wards to be given the type of high-quality masks usually only worn in intensive care units. Public Health England (PHE) has issued guidance on what PPE staff in different settings require. It was last updatedin October 2020,external. And you canread our explainer hereon face masks, including what protection they offer, what sort can be worn, and what the rules are across the UK. A highly contagious strain of coronavirus first detected in South Africa has spread to 20 countries, the WHO says The World Health Organisation (WHO) has expressed concern about the spread of new coronavirus variants. A highly infectious strain, which originated in the UK, has now spread to 50 countries and territories, the WHO said. Since the strain was first detected late last year, it has driven a spike in coronavirus infections and deaths linked to the disease in the UK. A strain first identified in South Africa, meanwhile, has spread to 20 other countries, the WHO said. Health experts say both new variants appear to be more transmissible than previous strains but not necessarily any more dangerous. They have also played down the possibility that vaccines will not be as effective against these variants. Still, the increased transmission of these variants is taking its toll. ""Going into a second year of this [pandemic] could even be tougher given some of the transmission dynamics,"" WHO expert Mike Ryan said during an event on social media. There are also concerns about a third new strain the Japanese authorities have identified in four people who are thought to have caught it in Brazil. BBC Radio 5 Live The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has been a major plank of the government's support during the pandemic. Under the furlough scheme, the government pays up to 80% of employees' wages up to Â£2,500. But it has been found to be open to abuse. New figures from HMRC given to BBC Radio 5 Live's Wake Up to Money programme show the department ishandling more than 21,000 reportsof suspected fraudulent use of the furlough scheme, 5,000 of which are under formal investigation. The money is either due to fraudulent claims, or is being paid out in error. The number of tip offs has spiralled sincelast April, from 3,000 to 21,378 reports of suspect payments by early January. HMRC told the BBC: ""This is taxpayers' money and fraudulent claims limit our ability to support people and deprive public services of essential funding."" The DUPâs Ian Paisley has failed to trigger an emergency Commons debate on the discarding of donated kidneys during the coronavirus pandemic. The MP for North Antrim said he had heard some viable organs had been discarded, and called for transplant operations to continue, perhaps using private facilities. Deputy Speaker Eleanor Laing later told him it would be not be allowed, but said a health minister was present and listening to his request.

Tightening of Scottish lockdown rules announcedRestrictions around takeaway food and click-and-collect services in Scotland are to be toughened.ScotlandComments,"This video can not be played Covid in Scotland: Stricter retail and takeaway rules 'to cut contact' Covid restrictions around takeaway and click and collect services in Scotland are to tighten. Only shops selling essential items - such as clothing, footwear, baby equipment, homeware and books - will be allowed to offer click and collect. Collections must also be outdoors, with appointments staggered to avoid queuing. And takeaways can no longer allow customers indoors, and must instead operate from a hatch or doorway. Retail organisations have warned that the new restrictions could be ""revenue-crushing"" for many businesses and would further harm already struggling retail and hospitality firms. The changes are among six new rules that will come into force on Saturday. They also include a ban on drinking alcohol outdoors in level four areas - which includes mainland Scotland and some islands - meaning takeaway pints cannot be consumed on the street or in places such as parks. Live: Stricter rules within days in Scotland What are Scotland's six new lockdown rules? Analysis: Business clicks but doesnât collect And statutory guidance will also be published for employers to support people working from home. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said that it essentially meant that if people were working from home during the lockdown last year, they must do so again this time. Rules around work carried out in private properties will also be tightened - with only work for ""maintenance, upkeep and functioning"" to be allowed, rather than for example painting and decorating. Finally, the first minister said the wording of the stay at home law will be altered to ""close an apparent loophole"" by preventing people from leaving home for an essential purpose and then remaining outdoors for non-essential reasons. Click and collect services have been a lifeline for many businesses since the level four rules were imposed across Scotland on Boxing Day Ms Sturgeon said: ""We believe that both individually and collectively these additional measures, in further reducing the interactions that allow the virus to spread, will help our essential efforts to suppress it."" And she urged people to stick to the spirit, not just the letter, of the lockdown rules, saying: ""Don't think in terms of the maximum interactions you can have without breaking the rules. ""Think instead about how you minimise your interactions to the bare essentials to remove as many opportunities as possible for the virus to spread. ""In everything you do, assume that the virus is there with you - that either you have it or any person you are in contact with has it - and act in a way that prevents it passing between you."" The Scottish government is acting now because of the strain on the health service. Its experts are warning the NHS could beoverwhelmed even under a 'stay at home' scenario,external. We've already seen two health boards postponing all non-urgent surgical procedures as an increase in Covid cases puts growing pressure on the system. The action from NHS Lanarkshire and NHS Ayrshire and Arran is showing how the numbers of Covid patients in hospital is really starting to impact on wider care. Wards that would usually treat people recovering from hip or knee replacements for example may need to be converted into Covid wards. Theatres, usually busy carrying out multiple routine surgeries will become high dependency or intensive care facilities. When staff need to be redeployed to work with Covid patients, it is not safe to carry out other routine work. These are the difficult choices many health boards will face over the coming weeks. Action required now to deal with this health emergency will have consequences later. A further 1,949 people have tested positive for Covid-19 in the past 24 hours, representing 10.2% of the total number of people tested. Patients in hospital with a confirmed case rose by 77 to 1,794, while 134 people are in intensive care units. The first minister also announced that the deaths of a further 79 people who had tested positive for the virus have been recorded - bringing the total by that measure to 5,102. But separate figures by National Records of Scotland put the total number of people to have died with confirmed or suspected cases of the virus at 7,074. All of mainland Scotland and some islands were placed into level four restrictions on 26 December - meaning all non-essential shops had to close - with schools remaining closed to most pupils until at least the end of the month. An evidence paper published by the Scottish government, which informed the latest restrictions, said Scotland's R number showed the virus was ""likely in another growth phase"" - although Ms Sturgeon said there were some signs that the lockdown was ""starting to stabilise"" the virus. The paper concluded that the current pattern of case numbers meant that rising levels of infection impacting hospitals and ICU was expected. It said this could lead to the NHS being ""overwhelmed"" in some areas ""even under a 'stay at home' scenario"". Business organisation CBI Scotland said click and collect services were often a ""lifeline"" for struggling small businesses amid the forced closure of all non-essential shops. And it said the government must publish ""compelling"" evidence to justify the tightening of restrictions. CBI Scotland director Tracy Black said: ""When well organised, click and collect services instinctively feel like a safe way for firms to keep trading. ""Of course, firms can choose to suspend click and collect if that makes sense for them, but for many others it could mean the difference between business survival or not."" The Scottish Chambers of Commerce said the new rules would ""only add to the growing desperation of businesses who have put finance and time aside to make their business Covid compliant, only to have to close anyway, with no clear route back to reopening.'' There have also been concerns that limiting click and collect will merely encourage more people to go to supermarkets to shop instead."" Scottish Conservative group leader Ruth Davidson said business owners felt the evidence for the ""unexpected"" decisions had not been made clear, and called on the first minister to ensure sufficient financial support was put in place.

Bombers charged with attacking prison officer,"Hashem Abedi (left) and Ahmed Hassan are due to appear at Bromley Magistrates' Court The Manchester Arena and Parsons Green bombers have been charged with assaulting a prison officer together, the BBC has learned. Hashem Abedi, 23, and Ahmed Hassan, 21, are accused of assaulting an officer in HMP Belmarsh, south London, in May last year. Another man who is awaiting sentencing for terror offences is also charged with assaulting the same person. The three men are due to appear at Bromley Magistrates' Court on 7 April. Abedi, who was jailed in August for murdering the 22 victims of the May 2017 Manchester Arena attack, is also charged with assaulting a second prison officer during the same incident on 11 May. Hassan, from London, whose Parsons Green tube bomb injured 51 people in September 2017, was jailed for attempted murder the following year. Muhammed Saeed, 22, from Manchester, is the third person charged. Last year, he admitted possessing terrorist documents.

Covid-19: Welsh Government updateDetails and reaction to a briefing by Wales' chief medical officer and NHS Wales chief executive.Wales,"Chief Medical Officer Dr Frank Atherton and NHS Wales Chief Executive Dr Andrew Goodall have been giving a press briefing on the pandemic Dr Goodall says the number of Covid patients in Wales' hospitals is now more than double the previous peak seen last April A health board launches a cancellation line for people unable to attend their Covid jab appointment after a small number of no-shows Online education is ""patchy and inconsistent"" and needs a clearer national approach, according to Wales' future generations commissioner Childline appeals for more volunteer counsellors, following a rise in calls during the pandemic Nicola Bryan and Andy Roberts That's all from our live coverage of the Welsh Government update on the pandemic. Here's a quick recap of today's main developments:  Thanks for joining us - you can keep up to date via the BBC News website and social media channels. Customs operators havepleaded with the UK government to prioritise vaccinations for their staffin the effort to keep vital supplies flowing into the UK. One operator told the BBC his staff were working flat out - often up to 16 hours a day - to help traders comply with the new post-Brexit customs requirements. ""A Covid outbreak would be disastrous. Customs clearance staff should be identified as key workers and fast-tracked for vaccination,"" the operator said. Another operator said he had written to Transport Secretary Grant Shapps and his local MP for Ashford, Damian Green, saying any coronavirus-related staff shortages could force them to close. Customs officers are having to help traders comply with post-Brexit rules Llangollen has been hosting a gathering of performers from all over the world since 1947 An annual world music festival is ""unlikely"" to go ahead this year in its traditional format because of the pandemic, organisers have said. Llangollen International Eisteddfod chair Dr Rhys Davies said restrictions in Wales and around the world are likely to impact staging the event. The committee is now working on a ""hybrid"" eisteddfod, combining virtual and small-scale live performances. Last July's event wascancelled for the first time in its historydue to Covid. The eisteddfod attracts about 40,000 visitors from around the world to the Denbighshire town every year. This video can not be played Have you been wondering when you will get your coronavirus vaccine, where you will have it and what to expect? More than 100,000 people across Wales have been vaccinated so far - but when will it be your turn? The Welsh Governmentpublished its vaccine strategy,externalon Monday, saying people aged over 50 and others with underlying health conditions will be offered a jab by spring, and all other adults by autumn. Here is a run down of everything you need to know. Avoiding care homes in Wales
closing due to coronavirus has been ""quite an achievement"" but the
situation remains ""precarious"", a minister has said. Homes have faced rising costs,
such as more staffing and personal protective equipment (PPE), and falling occupancy due to higher death rates. Deputy Health and Social
Services Minister Julie Morgan said homes had received financial help using a
hardship fund through local councils. ""We've been able to keep
them running but it has been difficult,"" she told the Senedd Health, Social Care and Sport Committee. ""Via the hardship fund that we've put in through local government, we've been able to avoid any homes
actually closing because of Covid reasons, which I think is actually quite an
achievement because that does mean that people who depend on their home
continuing are not disrupted,"" she said. ""We know how awful it is if
elderly people have to actually move. ""By helping to fund the
voids, that inevitably have been created in care homes, we've been able to keep
them running, but it has been difficult. ""It is precarious keeping
the care homes running, and I think we're aware of that the whole time.""  Adults with learning disabilities who live in supported housingshould be a higher priority for the Covid-19 vaccination, campaigners have said. A parents and carers' group want them vaccinated in the same round as health and social care workers and over-80s. There are about 3,500 adults with learning disabilities living in supported accommodation in Wales. The Welsh Government said the priority groups were set by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation. An academic said people with learning disabilities aged over 35 were at the same risk of dying as those in their 70s. People with learning disabilities are six times more likely to die from the virus than people of the same age and sex, according to a recent report fromPublic Health England,external. Pauline Dowden's son Steven, 36, is profoundly autistic with severe learning disabilities and lives in supported accommodation in Rhondda Cynon Taf. Mrs Dowden said he was very obese and had put on weight because his exercise activities had stopped in the pandemic. She says his team of 10 carers will be in priority group two for the vaccine, and she wants Steven and those in similar situations to be treated at the same time. The Welsh Conservatives have repeated their call for a faster delivery of Covid vaccines to people in Wales. Senedd group leader Paul Davies told BBC Wales: âWe need to roll out the vaccine as soon as possible because thatâs the way out of tackling the virus. ""327,000 doses have been received [in Wales] but only 101,000 people have received the vaccine, and we are falling behind other parts of the UK.â The Conservatives have called for a dedicated minister in the Welsh Government to be appointed to oversee the vaccination programme. Responding to suggestions of Covid cases stabilising in Wales, Dr David Bailey, chair of the BMAâs Welsh Council, said: âItâs good that the numbers have started to drop. ""But thatâs going to take three, four, five weeks to work its way through to the medical workload at the sharp end, in medical units, in emergency admissions and in critical care,"" he told BBC Wales. âPeople stay in critical care for a couple of weeks; you develop a serious illness with Covid maybe 10 days after you start, so all of these things move down the way in terms of when they come through in the health service. ""So weâve got at least another four, maybe five weeks of serious issues in terms of capacity.â The NHS Wales chief executive has dismissed the idea of sending recovering coronavirus patients to hotels as a strategy for freeing up hospital beds. Asked whether or not Wales could adopt the approach, which is reportedly under consideration in England, Dr Andrew Goodall said it âwouldnât be appropriateâ. He said the NHS field hospitals would provide a better alternative in many cases, but emphasised that for some patients, traditional hospital settings remained the best option. âWhilst they may have a label of 'recovering' on them, that does include some patients who are still very seriously ill and require a lot of additional clinical supportâ, Dr Goodall said. âI donât think that would be appropriate for either a field hospital environment and certainly wouldnât be appropriate for a hotel environment. âThe model that we put in place in respect of field hospitals for Wales was deliberately about supporting a post-discharge from acute hospital site, but pre-returning to home environment. âWe have 186 patients in our field hospitals across Wales and that volume is increasing at this stage."" It is too early to
know whether annual coronavirus vaccines will be needed, but people will have
to learn to live with the virus, Wales' chief medical officer says. Dr Frank Atherton pointed out that smallpox had been the only disease ever eradicated. Achieving the same
feat again was âan impossibility, pretty muchâ, he told the Welsh Government's
coronavirus briefing. âIt is likely â
well, it's pretty much a certainty - that we are going to have to learn to live
with coronavirus,â he said. âWe just don't know
what will happen to the virus. âIt does mutate,
like all viruses do.â Dr Atherton added: âIt's
quite possible that it may mutate to a milder form and become more of a
seasonal issue that we have to deal with on a yearly basis. âIf that is the
case then it's entirely likely that we may have to move to a situation, rather
like flu vaccination, where we have to give a seasonal vaccine against
coronavirus every year. âBut it is really
too early to know for sure. We will have to wait and see. âBut, for sure, coronavirus will be on the planet for some time to come.â Wales' chief medical officer says he would expect health
boards to set up vaccination centres working around the clock if there were public
demand for such a move. It comes after Prime Minister Boris
Johnson said hewanted
to get vaccine centres in England working 24/7 ""as soon as we can"". But Dr Frank Atherton said the public needed to recognise the need not to ""destabilise"" the NHS by diverting staff who were busy on other duties to run vaccination centres. ""If there is a real demand for further hours of opening then I would
expect them [health boards] to meet those,"" he said. ""But it depends partly on the supply... we'll go as
fast as we can but we will go as safely as we can, and we will go in a way which
avoids wastage as much as we possibly can."" Hospital staff are
exhausted and sickness levels are higher than normal for the time of year, the chief executive of NHS Wales says. Dr Andrew Goodall told
the Welsh Government's coronavirus briefing: âOur NHS staff report,
understandably so, that they are exhausted at the moment because this has been
a constant treadmill.â Around 9% were off
sick, compared to a usual rate of 5-6% for the time of year, he said. About half of that
was due to Covid-19 â either because staff themselves were ill or they had to
self-isolate. The woman said she could have bought the items in a parcel which cost the taxpayer Â£30 for little more than Â£5 A mother whoposted a photo on social media of a food parcel she receivedduring the pandemic has told of the ""sense of sadness"" she felt on seeing what it contained. Food parcels have been sent to pupils in England who would normally be eligible for free school meals while schools are closed during the coronavirus lockdown. The woman, using the online name Roadside Mum, posted a photo on Twitter of two carrots, two potatoes, a tin of baked beans and a small range of other food items. She estimated she could have bought the items - supposed to last 10 school days and worth Â£30 - for just over Â£5. The woman, who wants to be anonymous, told the BBC: ""As I unpacked that food parcel... and looked at the contents, it felt very sad and depressing."" Chartwells, the firm which supplied the parcel, has apologised. England's Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said schools will be able to offer vouchers rather than food parcels from next week. He told MPs he was ""absolutely disgusted"" by the photo of the food parcel's contents, and that his department had made it clear ""this sort of behaviour is just not right [and] will not be tolerated"". Twitter users in Wales compared the parcel unfavourably to one supplied to a family in Caerphilly. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

New variants of coronavirus could lead to further increases in transmission in Wales in the coming weeks, the chief executive of NHS Wales has warned. Dr Andrew Goodall said that while there were positive signs that the case rates in much of Wales were falling, there was concern that trajectory could change quickly. There were particular fears around north Wales, he said, where the number of people hospitalised with Covid-19 has doubled since Boxing Day. âI think this winter will be the most challenging I and other NHS staff will have experiencedâ, Dr Goodall said. âWelsh Government has put in place a number of interventions through December and pre-Christmas, which have perhaps allowed for us to have some impact and some evidence that things are starting to improve. âIf I look at the confirmed cases, actually they have both stabilised and perhaps even reduced a little bit. âIt still remains very challenging and very busy, and I think one of our worries for January is wherever we are, if the new variant has traction, we will potentially see further increases happening."" Wales is sticking to a UK-wide policy on delaying second doses of Covid-19 vaccine, Chief Medical Officer Dr Frank Atherton says. Official data suggest fewer people are getting second jabs in Wales than in other UK nations. Dr Atherton said: âYou will have to ask people in England why there are some cases where people have had second doses. âThere are a few in Wales. ""By and large I am really pleased that everybody in Wales is understanding that a second dose given now is a first dose denied to somebody else, and they need that protection.â Second doses had been given in some cases to avoid wasting vaccine after packs had been opened, he said, adding less than 1% of vaccine was being wasted in Wales. On 30 December the four UK chief medical officersagreed second doses of the Covid vaccines would be given 12 weeksafter the first jab, instead of four weeks. That means the system would âget more vaccine into more peopleâ, Dr Atherton said. There are some signs coronvirus levels are starting to stabilise, Walesâ chief medical officer says. Dr Frank Atherton said the case rate was around 410 per 100,000 people, but the numbers were still increasing in areas like Wrexham and Flintshire. ""The situation remains very serious, and we are still dealing with the added factor of the new, highly-contagious strain of the virus,â he said. âOver the course of the last few days, we have seen a small fall in the overall rate of the virus.â Around 20% of tests are now coming positive, Dr Atherton said, down from 25% last week. âThis is heading in the right direction but is still way too high,â he said. NHS Wales Chief Executive Dr Andrew Goodall says at current levels of Covid cases the health service would have to make some
very difficult decisions about the balance of services it could provide. It was already the most
challenging winter of his career, he said, adding it would be ""a while
yet"" before the number of admissions to hospital began to fall. ""The impact of the
restrictions, including the lockdown measures, will take some weeks to be felt
in the NHS,"" Dr Goodall said. The numbers of care home
residents and staff testing positive for Covid-19 have hit their highest
levels. There were 1,507 positive tests
in care homes in Wales in the most recent week, a 78% rise on the week before. Across Wales, 37,026 residents
and staff were tested by either the NHS or the Lighthouse laboratories the week beginning 4 January, according to Public
Health Wales. Broken down, 6,466 care home
residents were tested in the most recent week and 582 (9%) were positive in
results from NHS laboratories. Also, 248 care home workers
tested positive, with about 96% of tests negative. But there were another 677
positive test results from Lighthouse labs, which do not distinguish between
residents and care home staff. All of these categories saw the
highest numbers yet recorded. Residents and staff are supposed
to be tested weekly at care homes in Wales. Care Home Inspectorate Wales
also now publishseparate figures
around testing, which showed 137 care homes in Wales (13%)
had notified one or more positive cases in staff or residents in the most
recent week available and 31.8% within the last month. Swansea had 17 care homes which
had notified at least one case in the week ending 1 January; Cardiff had 15
homes with at least one case and Bridgend was next with 13 care homes. The number of Covid patients in Wales' hospitals is nowmore than double the previous peak seen last April. NHS Wales Chief Executive Dr Andrew Goodall said 2,870 people were being treated for the virus. The effect of lockdown restrictions will take some weeks to be felt, he told the Welsh Government's pandemic press conference. There are some signs that coronavirus levels are starting to stabilise, although numbers are still increasing in parts of north Wales.  Wrexham is still the local authority area with the
highest case rate in Wales, rising to 970.9 cases per 100,000 people. It is followed by
Flintshire, which has risen from 682.3 cases per 100,000 people yesterday to 710.4 today. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Lockdown impact 'starting to show' - PM,"The prime minister has said lockdown measures are ""starting to show signs of some effect"", but he has refused to rule out extra restrictions in England. At PMQs, Boris Johnson said measures were kept under ""constant review"" after Labour's Sir Keir Starmer said it was obvious more restrictions were needed. Mr Johnson added that vaccine centres would move to 24-7 ""as soon as we can"". Under the national lockdown, people in England must stay at home and only go out for limited reasons. This includes for food shopping, exercise, or work if they cannot do so from home. Similar measures are in place across much of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Later, Mr Johnson told the Commons Liaison Committee there was a ""very substantial"" risk of intensive care capacity in hospitals being ""overtopped"", and appealed to people to follow lockdown rules. He said the situation was ""very, very tough"" in the NHS and the strain on staff was ""colossal"". Meanwhile, First Minister Nicola Sturgeonhas announced new restrictions in Scotland from Saturday, including limiting click and collect services to essential items only and restricting takeaways. PM: 24-7 vaccine hubs as soon as supply allows Can I hug my vaccinated dad? And other questions When will you be eligible for the Covid vaccine? At Prime Minister's Questions, Sir Keir said stronger restrictions were needed in England and accused Mr Johnson of being ""slow to act"". He asked the prime minister why restrictions were weaker in this lockdown compared with March. This video can not be played Boris Johnson says the government acted ""within 24 hours"" of advice on the new Covid-19 variant ""We keep things under constant review,"" Mr Johnson replied. ""If there is any need to toughen up restrictions - which I don't rule out - we will of course come to this House. ""The lockdown measures we have in place combined with tier four measures that we were using are starting to show signs of some effect and we must take account of that too."" He added it was early days and urged people to abide by the rules. Questioned by the liaison committee on Wednesday afternoon, Mr Johnson said it was ""far, far too early"" to say there could be any relaxation of the lockdown in the middle of February, and ""we've got to work very hard to achieve that"". He acknowledged that it was a ""tragedy"" that so many children were missing face-to-face teaching at school and said reopening schools was ""the priority"". Tier four - the highest level in England's tier system which bans households mixing indoors - was introduced on 21 December in parts of south-east England, including London. It was then widened to include more of southern England on Boxing Day. England has been in a national lockdown since 5 January. Mr Johnson also said the vaccination programme was going ""exceptionally fast"" but ""at the moment the limit is on supply"" of the vaccine. ""We will be going to 24/7 as soon as we can,"" he told MPs, saying Health Secretary Matt Hancock will set out further details ""in due course"". Are we really staying at home? What is a 'reasonable excuse' for leaving home? More than 2.4 million people have had a first dose of a coronavirus vaccine, while 412,167 people have had a second dose. Scotland's Health Secretary Jeane Freeman said it was ""entirely possible"" to offer round-the-clock vaccinations in Scotland once mass sites were up and running by late February or early March. There are very early signs that infections may have peaked - although as always we should be careful about reading too much into a few days' worth of data. The past two days have seen newly diagnosed cases hover around the 46,000-mark. Up to the weekend, the average was close to 60,000. The drop has largely been driven by falls in new cases in London, the South East and East of England. The national picture does mask some regional differences. Cases are rising in the North West, which is causing particular concern. It is too early for the vaccination programme to be having any significant impact so a combination of the national lockdown on top of the tier four restrictions that were imposed in some areas before Christmas look like they may be beginning to have an impact. There is also some evidence the new variant may not be quite as fast-spreading as first feared - a Public Health England study suggested rather than being 70% more transmissible, it may actually be somewhere between 30% to 50%. And, if it does represent the start of a continuous fall, it is important to remember it will still take some time to translate into fewer hospital cases - people being admitted at the moment are those who would have caught the virus a week or two ago. But after six weeks of pretty sustained rises, it is at least an encouraging sign. Earlier, Health Secretary Matt Hancock questioned whether there would be demand for a round-the-clock vaccination operation, saying: ""Most people want to get vaccinated in the daytime, and also most people who are doing the vaccinations want to give them in the daytime, but there may be circumstances in which that would help."" He said England's lockdown measures were ""always under review"", but he would be ""very reluctant"" to remove the rule of meeting one other person outside for exercise as ""it is a lifeline"" for some people, including those who live alone. Mr Hancock has already ruled out scrapping support bubbles. ""What I'd rather is that everybody follow that rule and doesn't stretch it or flex it,"" he said.

Murder accused 'kept sex burglary trophies',"Libby Squire was not seen alive after travelling to Oak Road playing fields with Pawel Relowicz, a court heard A man accused of raping and murdering a student committed a string of ""sexually motivated"" burglaries in the months before her death, a court has heard. Pawel Relowicz, 26, denies killing Libby Squire and dumping her body. Jurors heard ""trophies"" - underwear and sex toys - stolen from other women were found after his arrest. Prosecutors claim he was ""prowling the streets"" of Hull's student area in search of a victim when he intercepted the ""extremely vulnerable"" Ms Squire. Sheffield Crown Court previously heard the defendant drove Ms Squire - who had earlier been refused entry to a nightclub -to the Oak Road playing fields. Once there, jurors were told, he subjected her to an ""act of sexual violence"" before he disposed of her body in the River Hull. Her remains were found in the Humber Estuary almost seven weeks later. Prosecutor Richard Wright QC said Mr Relowicz would claim Ms Squire had ""instigated consensual sexual intercourse"", and he had left her ""safe and well"" on the fields. Richard Wright QC continued to outline the case against Pawel Relowicz on Wednesday However, Sam Alford, who lives nearby, reported hearing a woman's ""desperate screams"" coming from the direction of the river, the court heard. Prosecutors allege the screams were Ms Squire's and a man seen ""emerging from the darkness"" and fleeing the area was the defendant. ""Libby was never seen again"", Mr Wright told jurors. The screams, and scratches to the defendant's face were evidence Ms Squire had ""fought him off"", the court heard. Mr Wright said the evidence established ""that she was raped by a man whose entire motivation for coming into contact with her that night was to take her away from safety to a remote area well known to him and there to subject her to his uncontrollable sexual urges"". The prosecutor said a pathologist concluded he could not establish how Ms Squire died despite ""an obvious bruise"" to the inside of her right thigh. Mr Wright told jurors a CCTV recording made after the last sighting of Ms Squire showed Mr Relowicz performing a sex act in the middle of a street. A condom found at the scene days later yielded a DNA profile matching the defendant, the court heard. In the year leading up to Ms Squire's disappearance, Mr Relowicz exposed himself to women in public and watched them through windows as they changed or had sex, the court heard. He also ""burgled their homes with the purpose of stealing their underwear and sexual toys or other objects,"" Mr Wright said. University of Hull student Libby Squire was last seen in the early hours of 1 February 2019 Following his arrest on 6 February, Mr Wright said, police recovered the pink holdall ""full of sex toys... and some photographs of young women and several pairs of women's knickers and thongs"". A statement made by Ms Squire's mother, Lisa Squire, was read out in court describing her daughter having battled mental health issues including an eating disorder, self-harming - cutting the top of her arms, legs and chest - and depression. She said her eldest child had been afraid of water since she was young, to the point she would not go near a swimming pool when on holiday. She was also scared of the dark, jurors were told. Statements by Ms Squire's boyfriend Connor James-Pye were also read out, in which he described Libby as being ""a happy drunk"" and that she ""didn't understand moderation"". However, on the night she disappeared, the court heard Ms Squire ""didn't want to go out because she had a lecture the next morning, but she didn't want to let the girls down"". Mr James-Pye last heard from his girlfriend at about 22:30 on 31 January, jurors heard. The trial continues.

Your vaccination questions answered,"The government has announced the end of all legal Covid restrictions in England, and Scotland has taken similar steps. Here are some of your questions on the changes: Because your son is in a clinical risk group - and as long as he is over five - he shouldsoon be offered two doses of the Pfizer vaccine. You should be contacted by your GP or specialist team to arrange this. With regard to the dangers of mixing, the UK has also recommended that Covid vaccines are offered to all children aged 5 to 11, not just those at high clinical risk. This is likely to start in England in April. Children are generally at much lower risk of becoming seriously ill from a Covid infection, although some do still get sick and need hospital care. Over-12s can already be vaccinated, and it's hoped that extending the rollout to younger age groups will help protect even more children from the risk of catching and spreading Covid. Schools are expected to work with and support families who have concerns about a pupil returning to the classroom. It is compulsory for school-age children to attend, even if they were previously shielding - the only exception is a small number of children whose clinician or GP has advised them not to attend. If you have concerns about this, you should talk to your doctor. If you live in England and are not in a vulnerable group yourself, it is unlikely that you will be entitled to a free test after 1 April. From that point, lateral flow tests should be available to buy from pharmacies and other retailers. The government says it will continue to provide free tests to the oldest age groups and those most vulnerable to Covid. We don't have the details of how this will work yet, but your mother and her care workers should still be eligible for free tests. Care homes are responsible for their own visiting policies, but at the moment across the UK, all visitors are expected to test for Covid before arrival. The chief scientific adviser Patrick Vallance has warned that further variants of Covid are expected - and that they could be more severe than previous ones. Therefore, although most of the free testing system is being dismantled in England, the government insists that the UK will continue to do detailed checks and surveillance to look for resurgences of Covid and any concerning new variants which may emerge. For example, some people in the community will still be asked to do regular tests for Covid as part of theOffice for National Statisticsâ Infection Survey. Positive test results collected this way can be analysed to identify the type of Covid people have. Throughout the pandemic, scientists have learned a great deal about how to track the virus, and the government says it will be possible to scale up such operations again in the future if necessary. Trials are already underway to test updated vaccines that could be a better match for the virus as it continues to change. The UK government also says it will also help support other countries in developing their own surveillance capabilities, because a new variant can emerge anywhere. NHS England says patients and staff should continue to wear face masks in GP practiceseven though they are no longer mandatory in public places. Face coverings also remain compulsory in healthcare settings in Scotland and Wales, and it is ""strongly advised"" that people wear them in Northern Ireland.

"UK reports record 1,564 daily Covid deathsIt brings the total number of deaths within 28 days of a positive test result to 84,767.","A further 1,564 people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive Covid test - the biggest figure reported in a single day since the pandemic began. It brings the total number of deaths by that measure to 84,767. Dr Yvonne Doyle, medical director at Public Health England, said there have now been more deaths in the second wave than the first. And the prime minister warned there was a ""very substantial"" risk of intensive care capacity being ""overtopped"". Speaking to the Commons Liaison Committee, Boris Johnson said the situation was ""very, very tough"" in the NHS and the strain on staff was ""colossal"". He appealed to the public to follow lockdown rules, which require people in England to stay at home and only go out for limited reasons, such as for food shopping, exercise, or work if they cannot do so from home. Similar measures are in place across much of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. A further 47,525 new caseshave also been recorded.,external Perhaps the most distressing element about the latest Covid deaths is that the numbers are almost certainly going to rise from here. People who are dying now are likely to have been infected three or so weeks ago, around Christmas time. That was at a point when infection rates were rising quite steeply, so in the coming days and weeks we should, sadly, expect to see more deaths than this being reported. Today's figures are affected by the weekend, which sees delays in reporting deaths that tend to translate into higher figures from Tuesday onwards. Currently around 1,000 people a day on average are dying once you take this into account. But the figures also provide some hope. For the third day in a row the number of newly diagnosed infections are well below 50,000. There have been several days where they have exceeded 60,000. If that trend continues, and the number of new cases keeps coming down, that will eventually translate into the number of deaths falling. But it is going to take some weeks for that to happen. These are, as many have been saying, the darkest days of the pandemic so far. Earlier, during Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Johnsonsaid lockdown measures were ""starting to show signs of some effect"". Labour's Sir Keir Starmer called for tougher restrictions in England, asking why they were weaker in this lockdown compared with March. During the first lockdown, nurseries were closed to most children and it was not permitted to exercise with someone from another household. ""We keep things under constant review,"" Mr Johnson replied. ""If there is any need to toughen up restrictions - which I don't rule out - we will of course come to this House."" He stressed that it was early days, but said: ""The lockdown measures we have in place combined with tier four measures that we were using are starting to show signs of some effect."" PM: 24-7 vaccine hubs as soon as supply allows Lockdown impact 'starting to show' Deputy chief medical officer gives out Covid jabs Later, asked by the Commons Liaison Committee whether schools could reopen after February half-term, Mr Johnson said: ""It is far, far too early for us to say [early signs of progress mean] we can go into any kind of relaxation in the middle of February, we've got to work very hard to achieve that."" This video can not be played Boris Johnson took questions from MPs on the Commons Liaison Committee The prime minister also said on Wednesday thatCovid vaccinations will be offered 24 hours a day, seven days a week as soon as supply allows. The number of people in the UK who have received the first dose of a vaccine has risen to 2,639,309 - up by 207,661 from the day before. Commenting on the latest daily figures, PHE's Dr Doyle said: ""With each passing day, more and more people are tragically losing their lives to this terrible virus."" She added: ""It is essential that we stay at home, minimise contact with other people and act as if you have the virus."" The vast majority of the deaths reported on Tuesday happened over the past week. However, at least 100 were in 2020, with one death dating back to May. The previous highest daily death toll was on Friday,when 1,325 people were reported to have died. These government figures count people who died within 28 days of testing positive, butthere are other ways of measuring the total number of deaths. When all deaths where coronavirus is mentioned on the death certificate are counted, plus deaths known to have occurred more recently, the number of deaths involving Covid in the UK is more than 100,000. Another method is to count excess deaths - all deaths over and above the usual number at the time of year. This video can not be played Johnson: ""We are taking steps to ensure that we do not see the import of this new variant"". Meanwhile, the prime minister has said he is ""concerned"" about a new coronavirus variant that is believed to have emerged in Brazil. He acknowledged it is not yet clear how effective existing vaccines will be against the latest new variant. The UK is taking steps to make sure it is not brought into the country, Mr Johnson said. A government Covid committee is meeting on Thursday to discuss the possibility of stopping flights from Brazil. Arrivals from Brazil already have to self-isolate for 10 days. And from Monday,anyone arriving into the UK from any countrywill have to present a negative Covid test. The new rule had been due to come into force this week but the government said it was being put back to give travellers more time to prepare. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area?

Vaccines from two companies are currently in use across the UK: Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna. People are advised to take whichever vaccine they are offered, as both provide protection against severe illness or death.

There's been a lot of coronavirus news around today - here are some of the main headlines: Jordan has launched a Covid-19 vaccination programme intended
to protect more than 20% of the kingdomâs 10 million population. The government has said the first stage will focus on people
over the age of 60, those with chronic illnesses, and medical personnel. It aims
to administer 5,000 shots a day at 29 centres. Health Minister Nazir Obeidattold the state news agency Petra,externalthat the first day had gone âsmoothlyâ. But the head of the ministryâs epidemics and communicable
diseases department, Wael Hayajneh,urged more people to register for the free vaccines,external, with
only 200,000 reportedly signed up since late December. The government has purchased vaccines produced by Pfizer-BioNTech
and China's Sinopharm. The latter was granted an âemergency licenceâ on Saturday. Jordan has seen a sharp fall in the daily number of new
infections since mid-November, when restrictions that
had been eased during the summer were reintroduced. More than 309,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19
and 4,076 deaths have been reported since the start of the pandemic. There's been focus this week on whether people are adhering to the rules around wearing face coverings in shops. Tesco, Asda and Waitrose have becomethe latest supermarkets to say they will deny entry to shoppers who do not wear face masks,  unless they are medically exempt. It follows a similar move by Morrisons, while Sainsbury's says it will challenge those who flout the rules. So what protection do masks offer, what sort can be worn, and what are the rules across the UK? Read our explainer here The education select committee chairman has asked the PM for the roadmap for reopening schools in England. Robert Halfon asked the prime minister about the mental health and social isolation effects on children being away from schools. Boris Johnson says the lockdown measures âhave got to continue to workâ, after showing âsome early signs of progressâ. But he says it was âfar, far too earlyâ to say that would lead to a relaxation next month.

committee is expected to discuss the new variant of coronavirus that has
emerged in Brazil tomorrow. The prime minister hinted to MPs that there could be restrictions on travel from Brazil to the UK - but a final decision has not been taken. Speaking to MPs he said: ""We are taking steps to ensure that we do not see
the import of this new variant from Brazil."" The Catholic Archbishop of Glasgow has died after contracting Covid-19 shortly after Christmas. Philip Tartaglia, 70, was one of the most senior figures in the Catholic Church in Scotland. The Church said his cause of death was not yet clear. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she felt ""deep sadness"" to hear of Archbishop Tartaglia's death. She told Scottish Parliament: ""I'm sure that is sadness shared by everybody across this chamber - and to send my deepest condolences to his loved ones and of course everybody in his community."" Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf said he had ""many fond memories"" of conversations he had shared with the archbishop. Philip Tartaglia was born in Glasgow in 1951 and was appointed Archbishop of Glasgow in 2012. He died on 13 January, which is the Feast of St Mungo - the patron saint of Glasgow. More than 9.3 million of Americans have received the first shot of a Covid vaccine The US has been by far the world's worst-hit nation in the pandemic, with Johns Hopkins University reporting late on Tuesday a record 4,470 Covid-related deaths in the past 24 hours. Here are the latest key developments in America on Wednesday:  The US has had more than 22 million confirmed infections since the start of the outbreak, according to Johns Hopkins. The overall Covid-related death toll has now exceeded 380,000, and is closing in fast on the number of American soldiers killed in World War Two, at about 407,000. Doctors' leaders have called for urgent improvements in personal protective equipment for health workers. The British Medical Association isappealing for a higher grade of face maskto guard against coronavirus infection. It says there is 'growing evidence' that the virus is being spread through the air by aerosols. These are tiny virus particles that can build up in stuffy rooms and they have been linked to outbreaks of Covid-19. This follows an open letter from more than 1,500 health professionals for staff on general wards to be given the type of high-quality masks usually only worn in intensive care units. Public Health England (PHE) has issued guidance on what PPE staff in different settings require. It was last updatedin October 2020,external. And you canread our explainer hereon face masks, including what protection they offer, what sort can be worn, and what the rules are across the UK. A highly contagious strain of coronavirus first detected in South Africa has spread to 20 countries, the WHO says The World Health Organisation (WHO) has expressed concern about the spread of new coronavirus variants. A highly infectious strain, which originated in the UK, has now spread to 50 countries and territories, the WHO said. Since the strain was first detected late last year, it has driven a spike in coronavirus infections and deaths linked to the disease in the UK. A strain first identified in South Africa, meanwhile, has spread to 20 other countries, the WHO said. Health experts say both new variants appear to be more transmissible than previous strains but not necessarily any more dangerous. They have also played down the possibility that vaccines will not be as effective against these variants. Still, the increased transmission of these variants is taking its toll. ""Going into a second year of this [pandemic] could even be tougher given some of the transmission dynamics,"" WHO expert Mike Ryan said during an event on social media. There are also concerns about a third new strain the Japanese authorities have identified in four people who are thought to have caught it in Brazil. BBC Radio 5 Live The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has been a major plank of the government's support during the pandemic. Under the furlough scheme, the government pays up to 80% of employees' wages up to Â£2,500. But it has been found to be open to abuse. New figures from HMRC given to BBC Radio 5 Live's Wake Up to Money programme show the department ishandling more than 21,000 reportsof suspected fraudulent use of the furlough scheme, 5,000 of which are under formal investigation. The money is either due to fraudulent claims, or is being paid out in error. The number of tip offs has spiralled sincelast April, from 3,000 to 21,378 reports of suspect payments by early January. HMRC told the BBC: ""This is taxpayers' money and fraudulent claims limit our ability to support people and deprive public services of essential funding."" The DUPâs Ian Paisley has failed to trigger an emergency Commons debate on the discarding of donated kidneys during the coronavirus pandemic. The MP for North Antrim said he had heard some viable organs had been discarded, and called for transplant operations to continue, perhaps using private facilities. Deputy Speaker Eleanor Laing later told him it would be not be allowed, but said a health minister was present and listening to his request. This video can not be played Covid-19: DUP MP says donated kidney discarded in pandemic Lisa SummersBBC Scotland Health Correspondent We heard earlier from Nicola Sturgeon thatrestrictions in Scotland will tightenfrom Saturday. The Scottish government is acting now because of the strain on the health service. Its experts are warning the NHS could beoverwhelmed even under a 'stay at home' scenario,external. We've already seen two health boards postponing all non-urgent surgical procedures as an increase in Covid cases puts growing pressure on the system. The action from NHS Lanarkshire and NHS Ayrshire and Arran is showing how the numbers of Covid patients in hospital is really starting to impact on wider care. Wards that would usually treat people recovering from hip or knee replacements for example may need to be converted into Covid wards. Theatres, usually busy carrying out multiple routine surgeries will become high dependency or intensive care facilities. When staff need to be redeployed to work with Covid patients, it is not safe to carry out other routine work. These are the difficult choices many health boards will face over the coming weeks. Action required now to deal with this health emergency will have consequences later. Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva The event at Wengen is one of the most prestigious at the Ski World Cup Switzerlandâs iconic Lauberhorn ski race has been cancelled because of rising cases of Covid-19, many of them, Swiss health officials say, spread by one British tourist. The resort of Wengen, where the famous race is held, had recorded no cases of the virus until October, and only ten until mid-December. After that, cases began to shoot up, and, worryingly, sequencing revealed many of them were the new highly infectious variant first detected in the UK. Contact tracers found that 27 of the cases alone could be linked to one British tourist who recently stayed in a Wengen hotel. Wengen desperately tried to save the race, offering to close off the resort to everyone but competitors, and even closing its schools. At first Swiss health officials agreed, but when, at the start of this week yet more Covid-19 cases were recorded, they pulled the emergency brake. Wengen is devastated. The Lauberhorn is not just any race, but one of the top competitions on the Ski World Cup circuit. It is dearly loved by the Swiss, who have watched with delight as some of their own home-grown talent - such as Beat Feuz and Carlo Janka - triumphed there. Rachel SchraerBBC Health Reporter As MPs have been mentioning today - a coronavirus variant has been found circulating in the Amazonas state of Brazil, and was picked up in Japan in travellers from the region. Itâs different from the UK and South African variants, but it contains common mutations - two changes to the virusâ ""spike"" in particular which have been flagged as potentially making the virus more infectious. This is not going to be the last mutation we hear about. At the moment changes are mainly being picked up in areas that do lots of genetic tracking of the virus - itâs almost certain there are other mutations already circulating unseen in other parts of the world. And the virus will continue to mutate - itâs just a question of how, how much and how fast. For now thereâs no evidence the virus is becoming more dangerous - but if more people catch it then, left unchecked, more will potentially become ill or die. But the vaccines, which target several different areas of the virusâ spike, should still work - though thatâs something that scientists the world over will be monitoring very closely. There have now been more deaths in the second wave of the pandemic than the first, Public Health England's medical director has said. Dr Yvonne Doyle was reacting to the new record of 1,564 deaths within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus in the UK that have been announced this hour. She said: âWith each passing day, more and more people are tragically losing their lives to this terrible virus, and today we have reported the highest number of deaths on a single day since the pandemic began. ""There have now been more deaths in the second wave than the first. âAbout one-in-three people with Covid-19 donât show symptoms, but can still pass it on to others so it is essential that we stay at home, minimise contact with other people and act as if you have the virus.â Labour's chair of the Home Affairs Committee Yvette Cooper, points out loopholes for travellers arriving home from abroad - including travelling on UK public transport when coming back from a holiday destination. Mr Johnson says there is a ""balanced approach"" from the government on the health of the nation vs the health of the economy. Ms Cooper says other countries brought in negative Covid tests as a requirement to travel ""months ago"" whereas the UK is only bringing these in from Friday. Mr Johnson says 3.5m passengers have been spot-checked since June 2020. He says a ""great deal of work"" goes into checking ""passenger data forms"" to check where people have come from. Ms Cooper says over 90% of those passenger data forms are not being checked. She says these checks ""might as well be voluntary"". Mr Johnson replies that those arriving from abroad are being screened. Ms Cooper asks why people from Brazil are not being checked for Covid, considering that there is a new strain in the South American country which could undermine the UK's vaccination programme. ""We are taking steps to ensure"" that the UK doesn't see the new variant in Brazil coming to the UK, replies Mr Johnson. Caroline Nokes, who chairs Parliament's Women and Equalities Commitee, then asks the PM about access to healthcare during the pandemic. She says the evidence shows it is women who are finding accessing services difficult, referring to a constituent who said her surgery was not currently doing smear tests. Nokes asks the PM what is an acceptable wait for a smear test? The PM says he sympathises with anybody who has had their treatment delayed. ""Sadly, that's what we are seeing. We're seeing delays in cancer, we're seeing delays in smear tests and vital services that people need, and that's a result in the increase in the numbers of Covid patients and that's why we have to work flat out to get the virus under control and reduce the current wave and give people the service we need."" Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Perhaps the most distressing element about the latest Covid deaths is that the numbers are almost certainly going to rise from here. People who are dying now are likely to have been infected around three weeks ago. That was at a point when infection rates were rising quite steeply, so in the coming days and weeks we should, sadly, expect to see more deaths than this. Todayâs figures are affected by the weekend, which sees delays reporting deaths that tend to translate into higher figures from Tuesday onwards. Currently around 800 to 900 people a day on average are dying once you take this into account. But the figures also provide some hope. For the third day, in a row the number of newly diagnosed infections are well below 50,000. There had been several days where they have exceeded 60,000. If that trend continues, and the number of new cases keeps coming down, that will eventually translate into the number of deaths falling. But it is going to take some weeks for that to happen. These are, as many have been saying, the darkest days of the pandemic so far. Caroline Nokes, who chairs Parliament's Women and Equalities Committee, asks the PM what additional protections are being put in place to help victims of domestic abuse who have insecure immigration status. The PM says the government has done ""what we can"" since the start of the pandemic to encourage victims of domestic abuse to come forward, including setting up helplines and investing in independent domestic abuse advisers. He says lockdown rules don't apply to victims of domestic abuse. Nokes follows up by asking why a better job is not being done of explaining lockdown rules to vulnerable people - for example, those who rely on British Sign Language or who might have learning difficulties. The PM says he has been asked a couple of times about sign language in particular, and he is going to ""take that away and see what we can do to increase sign language"". He adds that campaigns the government have produced are available in accessible formats and translations. Â© 2025 BBC.

Large trial of new Covid treatment begins in UK,"Kaye Flitney is one of those enrolled on the clinical trial A large-scale trial of a new treatment it is hoped will help stop Covid-19 patients from developing severe illness has begun in the UK. The first patient received the treatment at Hull Royal Infirmary on Tuesday afternoon. It involves inhaling a protein called interferon beta which the body produces when it gets a viral infection. The hope is it will stimulate the immune system, priming cells to be ready to fight off viruses. Early findings suggested the treatment cut the odds of a Covid-19 patient in hospital developing severe disease - such as requiring ventilation - by almost 80%. It was developed at Southampton University Hospital and is being produced by the Southampton-based biotech company, Synairgen. A course of treatment with the new drug could cost around Â£2,000, which is not that expensive for a hospital treatment. ""To be viable it will have to represent good value for money,"" Synairgen's chief executive Richard Marsden said. Covid: UK at 'worst point' of pandemic, says Hancock Two more life-saving Covid drugs discovered What drugs can help treat coronavirus? Alexandra Constantin, 34, was the first person to receive the treatment as part of this new trial, after she was admitted to the hospital with coronavirus on Monday. She has a young daughter at home she is desperate to get back to. Demonstrating the treatment, the nurse handed her a nebuliser that makes the drug into a fine mist, which Alexandra inhaled as deep into her lungs as she could. Interferon beta is part of the body's first line of defence against viruses, warning it to expect a viral attack. The coronavirus seems to suppress its production as part of its strategy to evade our immune systems. The new drug is a special formulation of interferon beta delivered directly to the airways via a nebuliser which makes the protein into an aerosol. The idea is that a direct dose of the protein in the lungs will trigger a stronger anti-viral response, even in patients whose immune systems are already weak. Interferon beta is commonly used in the treatment of multiple sclerosis. Previous clinical trials conducted by Synairgen have shown that it can stimulate an immune response and that patients with asthma and other chronic lung conditions can comfortably tolerate the treatment. The results of a smaller, phase two clinical trial of the treatment conducted last year were promising. It suggested the chances of a Covid-19 patient in hospital getting severe disease - requiring ventilation, for example - were reduced by almost 80%. Patients were two to three times more likely to recover to the point where everyday activities were not compromised by their illness, Synairgen claimed. It said the trial also indicated ""very significant"" reductions in breathlessness among patients who received the treatment. In addition, the average time patients spent in hospital is said to have been reduced by a third, for those receiving the new drug - down from an average of nine days to six days. But the trial was small, just 100 patients, and more testing is needed before it can be authorised for use. This new ""phase three"" trial is much larger. It will involve more than 600 patients in 20 countries. As in the earlier trial, half the participants will be given the drug, the other half will get what is known as a placebo - an inactive substance. The team running the trial say they hope it will be completed by early summer. If the results are anywhere near as good as in the earlier trial, they expect authorisation for the drug to be used in patients in the UK and other countries to follow shortly afterwards. This video can not be played Synairgen CEO Richard Marsden explains how the treatment uses the protein interferon beta to help fight the virus ""If we had a positive study, we would hope to move rapidly into scaled manufacture and delivery of the drug in clinical practice,"" said Prof Tom Wilkinson, of the University of Southampton, who is overseeing the trial. He added that he believes the new drug - if it proves effective - will be a complement to the vaccines that are being rolled out. He also pointed out it would take a long time for the whole world to be vaccinated. There will need to be treatments for people who miss out on vaccination or choose not to get the jab. There is also the risk the virus mutates and vaccines become less effective - meaning people begin to develop the disease again. The treatment is the result of the discovery by a team from Southampton University that people with lung diseases such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) often had low levels of interferon beta. ""We thought why not boost patients' interferon beta levels by getting them to inhale the protein,"" Prof Donna Davies, who was part of that team, said. She said research has now shown that Covid-19 can suppress the interferon beta response. But experts warn that drugs often do not live up to the promise of early trials. ""This is exciting, but we have to see what the phase three results show,"" says Dr Lamis Latif, a south London GP who has been working in emergency care with Covid-19 patients. ""We've had other drugs in similar circumstances, we've had hydroxychloroquine, for example, but again, when that reached further trials, it wasn't as promising as it initially made up to be. ""So that's something to really take note for this current drug."" VACCINES:When will you be eligible? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? GLOBAL SPREAD:How many worldwide cases are there?

Morrisons first UK supermarket to pay Â£10 an hour,"Morrisons will become the first UK supermarket to pay at least Â£10 an hour from April. It will increase its minimum pay for up to 96,000 workers from Â£9.20. Retail trade union Usdaw negotiated the Â£10 per hour basic rate which is 50p an hour above the voluntary Living Wage Foundation rate. However, other big supermarkets appear unlikely to follow any time soon, with Asda saying that just looking at hourly rates does not tell the full story. Morrisons said for the majority of its workers the pay increase will be approximately 9%. Part of the increase will result from changing the company's annual bonus scheme from a discretionary yearly payment into a guaranteed amount in workers' hourly rates. It will boost the weekly pay of someone working 36.75 hours a week from Â£330.10 to Â£367.50. Union members still need to approve the deal. The result will be announced on 12 February and, if accepted, the new rates will be paid from 5 April 2021. ""The new consolidated hourly rate is now the leading rate of the major supermarkets,"" said Joanne McGuinness, Usdaw national officer after the Morrisons announcement. ""It's been a tough time for food retail staff who have worked throughout the pandemic in difficult circumstances,"" said Ms McGuinness. ""They provide the essential service of keeping the nation fed and deserve our support, respect and appreciation. Most of all they deserve decent pay and this offer is a welcome boost."" In addition to the hourly pay increase, Morrisons will pay a higher London weighting. Rates for inner London will be 85p and for outer London 60p per hour, up from 75p in inner London and 50p in outer London. David Potts, Morrisons chief executive said: ""It's a symbolic and important milestone that represents another step in rewarding the incredibly important work that our colleagues do up and down the country."" Morrisons' move propels it to the top of the supermarket pay league, leapfrogging Aldi and Lidl. Will other big rivals follow suit? Supermarket staff have become frontline heroes in this pandemic and there's a new-found respect for the vital work they do in keeping us fed day-in day-out. Many consumers may welcome the idea of higher rewards for those staff. But supermarkets have already taken on a lot of extra costs in ramping up their operations as well as recruiting thousands of extra staff. And there are no shortage of workers looking for jobs right now, which could keep a lid on pay. Lidl has already announced plans to increase its hourly wage for staff from March, increasing the rate for 20,000 workers from Â£9.30 to Â£9.50. Within London's M25 motorway boundary the rate has increased from Â£10.75 to Â£10.85 an hour. ""It is only right that we increase the income for our colleagues who are the backbone of our business.,"" said chief executive Christian HÃ¤rtnagel. ""This is about recognising their hard work and dedication in keeping the nation fed during a year like no other. Asda, which pays Â£9.18 outside London and either Â£9.76 or Â£10.31 inside the capital, pointed out that it pays above National Living Wage rules and never employs on 'zero hours' contracts. An Asda statement said: ""On top of a competitive wage structure, Asda colleagues also receive a host of benefits which contribute to their yearly earnings, these including colleague discount in our stores and online, special discounts for shops and a yearly performance-based bonus. ""So simply looking at the hourly rate doesn't tell the full story."" Sainsbury's basic hourly pay is Â£9.30, and a statement to the BBC made no mention of any immediate intention to raise the rate. A spokesperson said, ""Our colleagues do a brilliant job and we are so proud of how they continue to go above and beyond for our customers. ""We have made two thank you payments to frontline workers in recognition of this in the last year and regularly review colleague pay to make sure we offer leading rates."" A Waitrose spokesperson said: ""Our hourly minimum starting pay across the UK for non-management Partners in Waitrose is currently Â£9.10 following a short induction period, with scope for higher pay according to performance. ""We review Partner pay annually each April and will do so again this year."" M&S said their minimum pay for workers is Â£9.00 an hour, but pointed out that those that worked during the pandemic last April and May were handed a 15% pay reward on top of the rate. Latest available data suggests Aldi currently pays Â£9.40 an hour, Tesco Â£9.30 and Co-op Â£9.

"Breaking|Breaking newsUK Covid daily death toll reaches new record highAnother 1,564 people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive Covid test.UK","A further 1,564 people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive Covid test - the biggest figure reported in a single day since the pandemic began. It brings the total number of deaths by that measure to 84,767. Dr Yvonne Doyle, medical director at Public Health England, said there have now been more deaths in the second wave than the first. And the prime minister warned there was a ""very substantial"" risk of intensive care capacity being ""overtopped"". Speaking to the Commons Liaison Committee, Boris Johnson said the situation was ""very, very tough"" in the NHS and the strain on staff was ""colossal"". He appealed to the public to follow lockdown rules, which require people in England to stay at home and only go out for limited reasons, such as for food shopping, exercise, or work if they cannot do so from home. Similar measures are in place across much of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. A further 47,525 new caseshave also been recorded.,external Perhaps the most distressing element about the latest Covid deaths is that the numbers are almost certainly going to rise from here. People who are dying now are likely to have been infected three or so weeks ago, around Christmas time. That was at a point when infection rates were rising quite steeply, so in the coming days and weeks we should, sadly, expect to see more deaths than this being reported. Today's figures are affected by the weekend, which sees delays in reporting deaths that tend to translate into higher figures from Tuesday onwards. Currently around 1,000 people a day on average are dying once you take this into account. But the figures also provide some hope. For the third day in a row the number of newly diagnosed infections are well below 50,000. There have been several days where they have exceeded 60,000. If that trend continues, and the number of new cases keeps coming down, that will eventually translate into the number of deaths falling. But it is going to take some weeks for that to happen. These are, as many have been saying, the darkest days of the pandemic so far. Earlier, during Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Johnsonsaid lockdown measures were ""starting to show signs of some effect"". Labour's Sir Keir Starmer called for tougher restrictions in England, asking why they were weaker in this lockdown compared with March. During the first lockdown, nurseries were closed to most children and it was not permitted to exercise with someone from another household. ""We keep things under constant review,"" Mr Johnson replied. ""If there is any need to toughen up restrictions - which I don't rule out - we will of course come to this House."" He stressed that it was early days, but said: ""The lockdown measures we have in place combined with tier four measures that we were using are starting to show signs of some effect."" PM: 24-7 vaccine hubs as soon as supply allows Lockdown impact 'starting to show' Deputy chief medical officer gives out Covid jabs Later, asked by the Commons Liaison Committee whether schools could reopen after February half-term, Mr Johnson said: ""It is far, far too early for us to say [early signs of progress mean] we can go into any kind of relaxation in the middle of February, we've got to work very hard to achieve that."" This video can not be played Boris Johnson took questions from MPs on the Commons Liaison Committee The prime minister also said on Wednesday thatCovid vaccinations will be offered 24 hours a day, seven days a week as soon as supply allows. The number of people in the UK who have received the first dose of a vaccine has risen to 2,639,309 - up by 207,661 from the day before. Commenting on the latest daily figures, PHE's Dr Doyle said: ""With each passing day, more and more people are tragically losing their lives to this terrible virus."" She added: ""It is essential that we stay at home, minimise contact with other people and act as if you have the virus."" The vast majority of the deaths reported on Tuesday happened over the past week. However, at least 100 were in 2020, with one death dating back to May. The previous highest daily death toll was on Friday,when 1,325 people were reported to have died. These government figures count people who died within 28 days of testing positive, butthere are other ways of measuring the total number of deaths. When all deaths where coronavirus is mentioned on the death certificate are counted, plus deaths known to have occurred more recently, the number of deaths involving Covid in the UK is more than 100,000. Another method is to count excess deaths - all deaths over and above the usual number at the time of year. This video can not be played Johnson: ""We are taking steps to ensure that we do not see the import of this new variant"". Meanwhile, the prime minister has said he is ""concerned"" about a new coronavirus variant that is believed to have emerged in Brazil. He acknowledged it is not yet clear how effective existing vaccines will be against the latest new variant. The UK is taking steps to make sure it is not brought into the country, Mr Johnson said. A government Covid committee is meeting on Thursday to discuss the possibility of stopping flights from Brazil. Arrivals from Brazil already have to self-isolate for 10 days. And from Monday,anyone arriving into the UK from any countrywill have to present a negative Covid test. The new rule had been due to come into force this week but the government said it was being put back to give travellers more time to prepare. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area?

Johnson: 24-7 vaccine hubs as soon as supply allowsThe prime minister wants round-the-clock vaccination but adds supply is currently the limiting factor.,"Covid vaccinations will be offered 24 hours a day, seven days a week as soon as supply allows, Boris Johnson says. The prime minister said the plan was to extend opening hours of vaccination centres - at the moment, most sites run from 08:00 to 22:00. The 24-7 service will be piloted in a small number of places first - with NHS staff likely to be offered the option of overnight vaccinations first. But Mr Johnson said supply was the limiting factor at the moment. The NHS had just over a million doses available last week and used up most of them. This week, there are thought to be more but not yet enough to vaccinate two million people - the weekly target the government is aiming to reach in the coming weeks. How will the UK jab millions of people? Can we really jab our way out of lockdown? Covid vaccine: When will you be eligible? At Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Johnson said there would be 24-7 vaccination ""as soon as possible"". The UK has access to two vaccines at the moment - the Pfizer-BioNTech jab and another produced in partnership by Oxford University and AstraZeneca. A third vaccine made by the US company Moderna has been approved but is not yet available to the UK. Mr Johnson praised the work of the more than 200 hospitals and 1,000 GP-led NHS vaccination sites running at the moment. ""They are going exceptionally fast,"" he added. By the end of Monday, 2.4 million people had received their first vaccine dose. The government has promised all the over-70s, the extremely clinically vulnerable and front-line health and care workers - about 15 million people - will be offered a jab by mid February. There is actually enough vaccine in the country to vaccinate all the highest at-risk groups. The problem is that not all of it has been packaged into vials or passed through the final safety checks. There should soon be two million doses available each week for the NHS to use. But the key question once that is achieved is how quickly and by how much supply can increase from there. To make full use of the network of vaccination centres - the ambition is to have 2,700 up and running - many millions of doses will be needed each week. There is huge global demand for these vaccines. And while the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab is made in the UK, the Pfizer-BioNTech one is made abroad as is the Moderna vaccine. Supplies of the latter are not expected until the spring. This is an issue the government is likely to be grappling with for some time. But despite the concerns, it should also be recognised the UK has been quick out of the blocks. Only two countries have vaccinated a larger proportion of the population than the UK. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said it was vital the government moved quickly. Speaking about the planned 24-7 vaccination, he said: ""I obviously welcome that and urge the prime minister and the government to get on with this."" Meanwhile, Nadhim Zahawi, the minister in charge of the vaccination programme, was also asked about supply, at an appearance before the Science and Technology Committee. He said he had a ""clear line of sight"" for the expected numbers that would be available to the NHS for the next few months but refused to give any more detail. ""The more we show off about how many vaccine batches we're receiving, the more difficult life becomes for the manufacturers,"" he said. AstraZeneca vice president Sir Mene Pangalos said one of the issues the firm was facing was that infections among staff had begun to hinder production. ""I feel that it is critical that those who are working on vaccines are immunised because if you have an outbreak at one of the centres, which we've had actually or in one of the groups in Oxford that's working on new variants, or those working on the regulatory files everything stops.""

US executes only woman on federal death row,"Lisa Montgomery was sentenced to death in 2007 Lisa Montgomery - the only female inmate on federal death row in the US - has been executed for murder. She received a lethal injection at a prison in Terre Haute, Indiana, after a last-minute stay of execution was lifted by the US Supreme Court. The case attracted attention because her lawyers argued she was mentally ill and suffered serious abuse as a child. The 52-year-old strangled a pregnant woman before cutting out and kidnapping her baby in Missouri in 2004. Her victim, 23-year-old Bobbie Jo Stinnett, bled to death but her baby was safely recovered and returned to her family. Montgomery is the first female federal inmate to be put to death by the US government in 67 years. According to witnesses, a woman standing next to Montgomery during the execution process, removed the inmate's face mask and asked her if she had any last words. Montgomery responded ""no"", and said nothing else. She was pronounced dead at 01:31 (06:31 GMT). Montgomery's lawyer, Kelley Henry, said that everyone who had participated in the execution ""should feel shame"". ""The government stopped at nothing in its zeal to kill this damaged and delusional woman,"" she said in a statement. ""Lisa Montgomery's execution was far from justice."" Protesters demanding an end to the death penalty gathered outside the prison in Terre Haute, Indiana The latest execution was postponed twice - first by Covid-19, then by a judge - until a Supreme Court ruling cleared the way for it to take place in the early hours of Wednesday. In adramatic move late on Monday, a judge in Indiana had halted the scheduled injection until a mental competency hearing could be held. Her lawyers argued that she had been born brain-damaged and was too mentally ill to be executed. As a child she was routinely sexually and physically abused by her father and trafficked by her mother, family members said. Her treatment was so violent that it amounted to torture, her lawyers say. Her defence team believe that at the time of her crime, Montgomery was psychotic and out of touch with reality. That opinion is supported by 41 current and former lawyers as well as human rights groups like the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. But her victim's family and friends say the murder committed by Montgomery was so horrific that she deserved to be put to death regardless of her mental health. Lisa Montgomery: Looking for answers in the life of a killer In Trump's final days, a rush of federal executions US government death penalty move draws sharp criticism She killed 23-year-old Stinnett in Skidmore, Missouri, after befriending the pregnant woman online over a shared love of dogs. After driving to Stinnett's house, Montgomery overpowered the pregnant woman, strangled her with a piece of rope, and cut the baby out of her womb. Police found Montgomery cradling a new-born girl she claimed to have given birth to the day before. After her story fell apart, she confessed to the killing. She was found guilty of the crime in 2007. The next day, she was sentenced to death. Analysis by Jessica Lussenhop, BBC News, Washington The fight to save the life of a death row inmate is always dramatic up until the very last moment, and none more so than the fight to save Lisa Montgomery. Although only President Trump had the power to grant her clemency and commute her sentence to life in prison, if her lawyers were able to delay her execution until after President-elect Biden takes office, they would have effectively achieved the same thing. Biden has pledged to end the death penalty on the federal level. And so it all ended - as many death penalty cases do - in an 11th hour flurry of legal filings that pitted Montgomery's legal team against lawyers for the Department of Justice, who were urging the execution forward. Ultimately, the US Supreme Court ruled against Montgomery in all three of her final legal challenges, including one that argued that it would be unconstitutional to execute Montgomery because she is not mentally competent. Since 2008, Montgomery had been held in a federal prison in Texas for female inmates with special needs, where she has been receiving psychiatric care. Since receiving her execution date, she'd been placed on suicide watch in an isolated cell. Montgomery's lawyer, Ms Henry, said her original legal defence was woefully inadequate, and presented few of the details about her abuse, trauma and mental illness. The Supreme Court outlawed the death penalty at state and federal level in 1972 but reversed the decision four years later. Since 1976, 16 women other than Lisa Montgomery have been executed but all by individual states rather than by the government. Before Montgomery's execution, the last woman to be executed by the US government was Bonnie Heady, who died in a gas chamber in Missouri in 1953, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. Federal executions had been on pause for 17 years before President Donald Trump ordered them to resume earlier last year.

What are Scotland's six new rules?,"Changes to Scotland's lockdown restrictions have been announced. The tightening of the rules follows concerns the ""stay at home"" message is not having the same impact it did during last year's lockdown. The changes will come into effect on Saturday. Follow the latest coronavirus news Tightening of Scottish lockdown rules announced The availability and operation of click and collect services will be limited to retailers selling essential items such as clothes, footwear, baby equipment, homeware and books. Also, outlets that sell electrical goods; do key cutting; undertake shoe repairs, plus garden centres and plant nurseries can continue the collect service. For qualifying businesses, staggered appointments will need to be offered to avoid any potential for queuing, and access inside premises for collection will not be permitted. Analysis: Business clicks but doesnât collect Customers in Scotland will no longer be allowed to go inside to collect takeaway food or coffee. Businesses will have to operate from a serving hatch or doorway. The aim is to reduce the risk of customers coming into contact indoors with each other, or with staff. It will be against the law in all level four areas of Scotland to drink alcohol outdoors in public. This will mean that buying a takeaway pint and consuming on the street will not be permitted. It is intended to underline the message that people should only be leaving home for essential purposes. The Scottish government is strengthening the obligation on employers to allow their staff to work from home whenever possible. The law already says that people should only be leaving home to go to work if it is work that cannot be done from home. This is a legal obligation that falls on individuals. However, statutory guidance is being introduced to make clear that employers should support employees to work from home wherever possible. The Scottish government is strengthening provisions in relation to work inside people's houses. Current guidance says that in level four areas work is only permitted within a private dwelling if it is essential for the upkeep, maintenance and functioning of the household.  This guidance is now being put into law. The final change is an amendment to the regulations requiring people to stay at home. This is intended to close an apparent loophole rather than change the spirit of the law. It will also bring the wording of the stay at home regulations in Scotland into line with the other UK nations. Currently the law states that people can only leave home for an essential purpose. The amendment will make it clear that people ""must not leave or remain outside"" the home unless it is for an essential purpose.

"Scotland aims for 400,000 vaccinations each week","Up to 400,000 people could be given the Covid-19 vaccine every week by the end of February, Scottish Health Secretary Jeane Freeman has told MSPs. Health teams are ramping up the rollout of jabs, with 1,100 vaccination centres now open and using two vaccines. Ministers aim to vaccinate care home residents, NHS staff and over-80s by the first week of February. They then hope to have completed the over-70 group by mid-February and over-65 and vulnerable groups by March. This would see 1.4m people given the jab, and Ms Freeman said the government's ""priority is to vaccinate as many people as quickly as possible"". Live: Latest on coronavirus in Scotland All over-80s to be vaccinated by February However, the BMA Scottish GP Committee has warned the vaccine supply is ""stuttering"" and blamed ""bureaucratic hold-ups"" for delaying distribution. In a statement at Holyrood, the health secretary said Scotland faces ""a more perilous situation than at any point in this pandemic"", with the new variant of coronavirus ""increasing in its dominance"" of infections north of the border. However Ms Freeman said there was hope in the form of the vaccination programme, which she said was ""scaling up rapidly"". A first dose of vaccine has now been given to just over 80% of care home residents and 55% of staff, along with 52% of frontline NHS staff. And in the eight days since 4 January, just over 2% of those aged 80 or over in the community have been given a first dose. Ms Freeman said that age was ""the greatest risk factor for serious illness and death from Covid, and represents well over 90% of preventable mortality"". The government is prioritising giving a first dose to as many people as possible, which Ms Freeman said provides ""very high protection"", with a second dose of the same vaccine then administered within 12 weeks. Ms Freeman said that by the end of February, an average of 400,000 people should be getting a jab per week. Jeane Freeman said the vaccine programme was ""scaling up rapidly"" The government is also working to set up large vaccination centres in the community, which could handle up to 20,000 vaccinations a week in a single location. Sites include the Event Complex conference centre in Aberdeen, Ravenscraig Regional Sports Facility in Motherwell, Queen Margaret University in Musselburgh and the Edinburgh International Conference Centre, and Ms Freeman said work was ongoing to secure more centres in the Glasgow area in particular. A total of 4.5m adults in Scotland are in line to be vaccinated. Ms Freeman said she was aware that people would ""want to know when it will be their turn"", saying a national advertising campaign would be established to ""inform the public"". Scottish Conservative health spokesman Donald Cameron said it was ""clear not enough people are being vaccinated each day and timetables are slipping"". He also asked Ms Freeman whether there were delays to the creation of a national booking system, after speculation that it could hold up the start of mass vaccinations. The health secretary said she did not believe it was the case that timetables were slipping, and said there were no delays to the national booking system - adding that it would be ""ready from the beginning of February to do its job"". Meanwhile Scottish Labour's Monica Lennon asked how quickly the country could move to a 24 hours a day rollout of vaccines. Ms Freeman said this was ""entirely possible"" once the mass vaccination centres are open, saying she ""would anticipate that would be by the end of February or early March"". She said: ""The will is there to do that, if that is what it takes, because the objective is to get as many people vaccinated as possible."" The BMA Scottish GP Committee has said practices ""don't know when their next supply is coming in"". Its chairman, Dr Andrew Buist, toldBBC Scotland's Drivetime programmethe Scottish government ""must do everything possible to ensure vaccine supply is as good as it can be"". He said: ""I've spoken with the chief medical officer about this and emphasised we should remove any bureaucratic hold-up to the distribution of this vaccine. ""People are obviously very anxious to get it as soon as possible. ""We know what the priority groups are, we have the practices ready and running to give it to their patients. We just need to get the vaccine to them."" LEVELS:What are the restrictions in your area? LOCKDOWN:Six months that changed our lives CASES:Where are the latest cases in Scotland?

There's been a lot of coronavirus news around today - here are some of the main headlines: Jordan has launched a Covid-19 vaccination programme intended
to protect more than 20% of the kingdomâs 10 million population. The government has said the first stage will focus on people
over the age of 60, those with chronic illnesses, and medical personnel. It aims
to administer 5,000 shots a day at 29 centres. Health Minister Nazir Obeidattold the state news agency Petra,externalthat the first day had gone âsmoothlyâ. But the head of the ministryâs epidemics and communicable
diseases department, Wael Hayajneh,urged more people to register for the free vaccines,external, with
only 200,000 reportedly signed up since late December. The government has purchased vaccines produced by Pfizer-BioNTech
and China's Sinopharm. The latter was granted an âemergency licenceâ on Saturday. Jordan has seen a sharp fall in the daily number of new
infections since mid-November, when restrictions that
had been eased during the summer were reintroduced. More than 309,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19
and 4,076 deaths have been reported since the start of the pandemic. There's been focus this week on whether people are adhering to the rules around wearing face coverings in shops. Tesco, Asda and Waitrose have becomethe latest supermarkets to say they will deny entry to shoppers who do not wear face masks,  unless they are medically exempt. It follows a similar move by Morrisons, while Sainsbury's says it will challenge those who flout the rules. So what protection do masks offer, what sort can be worn, and what are the rules across the UK? Read our explainer here The education select committee chairman has asked the PM for the roadmap for reopening schools in England. Robert Halfon asked the prime minister about the mental health and social isolation effects on children being away from schools. Boris Johnson says the lockdown measures âhave got to continue to workâ, after showing âsome early signs of progressâ. But he says it was âfar, far too earlyâ to say that would lead to a relaxation next month.

committee is expected to discuss the new variant of coronavirus that has
emerged in Brazil tomorrow. The prime minister hinted to MPs that there could be restrictions on travel from Brazil to the UK - but a final decision has not been taken. Speaking to MPs he said: ""We are taking steps to ensure that we do not see
the import of this new variant from Brazil."" The Catholic Archbishop of Glasgow has died after contracting Covid-19 shortly after Christmas. Philip Tartaglia, 70, was one of the most senior figures in the Catholic Church in Scotland. The Church said his cause of death was not yet clear. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she felt ""deep sadness"" to hear of Archbishop Tartaglia's death. She told Scottish Parliament: ""I'm sure that is sadness shared by everybody across this chamber - and to send my deepest condolences to his loved ones and of course everybody in his community."" Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf said he had ""many fond memories"" of conversations he had shared with the archbishop. Philip Tartaglia was born in Glasgow in 1951 and was appointed Archbishop of Glasgow in 2012. He died on 13 January, which is the Feast of St Mungo - the patron saint of Glasgow. More than 9.3 million of Americans have received the first shot of a Covid vaccine The US has been by far the world's worst-hit nation in the pandemic, with Johns Hopkins University reporting late on Tuesday a record 4,470 Covid-related deaths in the past 24 hours. Here are the latest key developments in America on Wednesday:  The US has had more than 22 million confirmed infections since the start of the outbreak, according to Johns Hopkins. The overall Covid-related death toll has now exceeded 380,000, and is closing in fast on the number of American soldiers killed in World War Two, at about 407,000. Doctors' leaders have called for urgent improvements in personal protective equipment for health workers. The British Medical Association isappealing for a higher grade of face maskto guard against coronavirus infection. It says there is 'growing evidence' that the virus is being spread through the air by aerosols. These are tiny virus particles that can build up in stuffy rooms and they have been linked to outbreaks of Covid-19. This follows an open letter from more than 1,500 health professionals for staff on general wards to be given the type of high-quality masks usually only worn in intensive care units. Public Health England (PHE) has issued guidance on what PPE staff in different settings require. It was last updatedin October 2020,external. And you canread our explainer hereon face masks, including what protection they offer, what sort can be worn, and what the rules are across the UK. A highly contagious strain of coronavirus first detected in South Africa has spread to 20 countries, the WHO says The World Health Organisation (WHO) has expressed concern about the spread of new coronavirus variants. A highly infectious strain, which originated in the UK, has now spread to 50 countries and territories, the WHO said. Since the strain was first detected late last year, it has driven a spike in coronavirus infections and deaths linked to the disease in the UK. A strain first identified in South Africa, meanwhile, has spread to 20 other countries, the WHO said. Health experts say both new variants appear to be more transmissible than previous strains but not necessarily any more dangerous. They have also played down the possibility that vaccines will not be as effective against these variants. Still, the increased transmission of these variants is taking its toll. ""Going into a second year of this [pandemic] could even be tougher given some of the transmission dynamics,"" WHO expert Mike Ryan said during an event on social media. There are also concerns about a third new strain the Japanese authorities have identified in four people who are thought to have caught it in Brazil. BBC Radio 5 Live The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has been a major plank of the government's support during the pandemic. Under the furlough scheme, the government pays up to 80% of employees' wages up to Â£2,500. But it has been found to be open to abuse. New figures from HMRC given to BBC Radio 5 Live's Wake Up to Money programme show the department ishandling more than 21,000 reportsof suspected fraudulent use of the furlough scheme, 5,000 of which are under formal investigation. The money is either due to fraudulent claims, or is being paid out in error. The number of tip offs has spiralled sincelast April, from 3,000 to 21,378 reports of suspect payments by early January. HMRC told the BBC: ""This is taxpayers' money and fraudulent claims limit our ability to support people and deprive public services of essential funding."" The DUPâs Ian Paisley has failed to trigger an emergency Commons debate on the discarding of donated kidneys during the coronavirus pandemic. The MP for North Antrim said he had heard some viable organs had been discarded, and called for transplant operations to continue, perhaps using private facilities. Deputy Speaker Eleanor Laing later told him it would be not be allowed, but said a health minister was present and listening to his request. This video can not be played Covid-19: DUP MP says donated kidney discarded in pandemic Lisa SummersBBC Scotland Health Correspondent We heard earlier from Nicola Sturgeon thatrestrictions in Scotland will tightenfrom Saturday. The Scottish government is acting now because of the strain on the health service. Its experts are warning the NHS could beoverwhelmed even under a 'stay at home' scenario,external. We've already seen two health boards postponing all non-urgent surgical procedures as an increase in Covid cases puts growing pressure on the system. The action from NHS Lanarkshire and NHS Ayrshire and Arran is showing how the numbers of Covid patients in hospital is really starting to impact on wider care. Wards that would usually treat people recovering from hip or knee replacements for example may need to be converted into Covid wards. Theatres, usually busy carrying out multiple routine surgeries will become high dependency or intensive care facilities. When staff need to be redeployed to work with Covid patients, it is not safe to carry out other routine work. These are the difficult choices many health boards will face over the coming weeks. Action required now to deal with this health emergency will have consequences later. Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva The event at Wengen is one of the most prestigious at the Ski World Cup Switzerlandâs iconic Lauberhorn ski race has been cancelled because of rising cases of Covid-19, many of them, Swiss health officials say, spread by one British tourist. The resort of Wengen, where the famous race is held, had recorded no cases of the virus until October, and only ten until mid-December. After that, cases began to shoot up, and, worryingly, sequencing revealed many of them were the new highly infectious variant first detected in the UK. Contact tracers found that 27 of the cases alone could be linked to one British tourist who recently stayed in a Wengen hotel. Wengen desperately tried to save the race, offering to close off the resort to everyone but competitors, and even closing its schools. At first Swiss health officials agreed, but when, at the start of this week yet more Covid-19 cases were recorded, they pulled the emergency brake. Wengen is devastated. The Lauberhorn is not just any race, but one of the top competitions on the Ski World Cup circuit. It is dearly loved by the Swiss, who have watched with delight as some of their own home-grown talent - such as Beat Feuz and Carlo Janka - triumphed there. Rachel SchraerBBC Health Reporter As MPs have been mentioning today - a coronavirus variant has been found circulating in the Amazonas state of Brazil, and was picked up in Japan in travellers from the region. Itâs different from the UK and South African variants, but it contains common mutations - two changes to the virusâ ""spike"" in particular which have been flagged as potentially making the virus more infectious. This is not going to be the last mutation we hear about. At the moment changes are mainly being picked up in areas that do lots of genetic tracking of the virus - itâs almost certain there are other mutations already circulating unseen in other parts of the world. And the virus will continue to mutate - itâs just a question of how, how much and how fast. For now thereâs no evidence the virus is becoming more dangerous - but if more people catch it then, left unchecked, more will potentially become ill or die. But the vaccines, which target several different areas of the virusâ spike, should still work - though thatâs something that scientists the world over will be monitoring very closely. There have now been more deaths in the second wave of the pandemic than the first, Public Health England's medical director has said. Dr Yvonne Doyle was reacting to the new record of 1,564 deaths within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus in the UK that have been announced this hour. She said: âWith each passing day, more and more people are tragically losing their lives to this terrible virus, and today we have reported the highest number of deaths on a single day since the pandemic began. ""There have now been more deaths in the second wave than the first. âAbout one-in-three people with Covid-19 donât show symptoms, but can still pass it on to others so it is essential that we stay at home, minimise contact with other people and act as if you have the virus.â Labour's chair of the Home Affairs Committee Yvette Cooper, points out loopholes for travellers arriving home from abroad - including travelling on UK public transport when coming back from a holiday destination. Mr Johnson says there is a ""balanced approach"" from the government on the health of the nation vs the health of the economy. Ms Cooper says other countries brought in negative Covid tests as a requirement to travel ""months ago"" whereas the UK is only bringing these in from Friday. Mr Johnson says 3.5m passengers have been spot-checked since June 2020. He says a ""great deal of work"" goes into checking ""passenger data forms"" to check where people have come from. Ms Cooper says over 90% of those passenger data forms are not being checked. She says these checks ""might as well be voluntary"". Mr Johnson replies that those arriving from abroad are being screened. Ms Cooper asks why people from Brazil are not being checked for Covid, considering that there is a new strain in the South American country which could undermine the UK's vaccination programme. ""We are taking steps to ensure"" that the UK doesn't see the new variant in Brazil coming to the UK, replies Mr Johnson. Caroline Nokes, who chairs Parliament's Women and Equalities Commitee, then asks the PM about access to healthcare during the pandemic. She says the evidence shows it is women who are finding accessing services difficult, referring to a constituent who said her surgery was not currently doing smear tests. Nokes asks the PM what is an acceptable wait for a smear test? The PM says he sympathises with anybody who has had their treatment delayed. ""Sadly, that's what we are seeing. We're seeing delays in cancer, we're seeing delays in smear tests and vital services that people need, and that's a result in the increase in the numbers of Covid patients and that's why we have to work flat out to get the virus under control and reduce the current wave and give people the service we need."" Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Perhaps the most distressing element about the latest Covid deaths is that the numbers are almost certainly going to rise from here. People who are dying now are likely to have been infected around three weeks ago. That was at a point when infection rates were rising quite steeply, so in the coming days and weeks we should, sadly, expect to see more deaths than this. Todayâs figures are affected by the weekend, which sees delays reporting deaths that tend to translate into higher figures from Tuesday onwards. Currently around 800 to 900 people a day on average are dying once you take this into account. But the figures also provide some hope. For the third day, in a row the number of newly diagnosed infections are well below 50,000. There had been several days where they have exceeded 60,000. If that trend continues, and the number of new cases keeps coming down, that will eventually translate into the number of deaths falling. But it is going to take some weeks for that to happen. These are, as many have been saying, the darkest days of the pandemic so far. Caroline Nokes, who chairs Parliament's Women and Equalities Committee, asks the PM what additional protections are being put in place to help victims of domestic abuse who have insecure immigration status. The PM says the government has done ""what we can"" since the start of the pandemic to encourage victims of domestic abuse to come forward, including setting up helplines and investing in independent domestic abuse advisers. He says lockdown rules don't apply to victims of domestic abuse. Nokes follows up by asking why a better job is not being done of explaining lockdown rules to vulnerable people - for example, those who rely on British Sign Language or who might have learning difficulties. The PM says he has been asked a couple of times about sign language in particular, and he is going to ""take that away and see what we can do to increase sign language"". He adds that campaigns the government have produced are available in accessible formats and translations. Â© 2025 BBC.

There's been a lot of coronavirus news around today - here are some of the main headlines: Jordan has launched a Covid-19 vaccination programme intended
to protect more than 20% of the kingdomâs 10 million population. The government has said the first stage will focus on people
over the age of 60, those with chronic illnesses, and medical personnel. It aims
to administer 5,000 shots a day at 29 centres. Health Minister Nazir Obeidattold the state news agency Petra,externalthat the first day had gone âsmoothlyâ. But the head of the ministryâs epidemics and communicable
diseases department, Wael Hayajneh,urged more people to register for the free vaccines,external, with
only 200,000 reportedly signed up since late December. The government has purchased vaccines produced by Pfizer-BioNTech
and China's Sinopharm. The latter was granted an âemergency licenceâ on Saturday. Jordan has seen a sharp fall in the daily number of new
infections since mid-November, when restrictions that
had been eased during the summer were reintroduced. More than 309,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19
and 4,076 deaths have been reported since the start of the pandemic. There's been focus this week on whether people are adhering to the rules around wearing face coverings in shops. Tesco, Asda and Waitrose have becomethe latest supermarkets to say they will deny entry to shoppers who do not wear face masks,  unless they are medically exempt. It follows a similar move by Morrisons, while Sainsbury's says it will challenge those who flout the rules. So what protection do masks offer, what sort can be worn, and what are the rules across the UK? Read our explainer here The education select committee chairman has asked the PM for the roadmap for reopening schools in England. Robert Halfon asked the prime minister about the mental health and social isolation effects on children being away from schools. Boris Johnson says the lockdown measures âhave got to continue to workâ, after showing âsome early signs of progressâ. But he says it was âfar, far too earlyâ to say that would lead to a relaxation next month. This video can not be played Covid-19: Johnson and Halfon on lockdown effect on children Gavin StampBBC political reporter The UK governmentâs Covid O
committee is expected to discuss the new variant of coronavirus that has
emerged in Brazil tomorrow. The prime minister hinted to MPs that there could be restrictions on travel from Brazil to the UK - but a final decision has not been taken. Speaking to MPs he said: ""We are taking steps to ensure that we do not see
the import of this new variant from Brazil."" The Catholic Archbishop of Glasgow has died after contracting Covid-19 shortly after Christmas. Philip Tartaglia, 70, was one of the most senior figures in the Catholic Church in Scotland. The Church said his cause of death was not yet clear. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she felt ""deep sadness"" to hear of Archbishop Tartaglia's death. She told Scottish Parliament: ""I'm sure that is sadness shared by everybody across this chamber - and to send my deepest condolences to his loved ones and of course everybody in his community."" Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf said he had ""many fond memories"" of conversations he had shared with the archbishop. Philip Tartaglia was born in Glasgow in 1951 and was appointed Archbishop of Glasgow in 2012. He died on 13 January, which is the Feast of St Mungo - the patron saint of Glasgow. More than 9.3 million of Americans have received the first shot of a Covid vaccine The US has been by far the world's worst-hit nation in the pandemic, with Johns Hopkins University reporting late on Tuesday a record 4,470 Covid-related deaths in the past 24 hours. Here are the latest key developments in America on Wednesday:  The US has had more than 22 million confirmed infections since the start of the outbreak, according to Johns Hopkins. The overall Covid-related death toll has now exceeded 380,000, and is closing in fast on the number of American soldiers killed in World War Two, at about 407,000. Doctors' leaders have called for urgent improvements in personal protective equipment for health workers. The British Medical Association isappealing for a higher grade of face maskto guard against coronavirus infection. It says there is 'growing evidence' that the virus is being spread through the air by aerosols. These are tiny virus particles that can build up in stuffy rooms and they have been linked to outbreaks of Covid-19. This follows an open letter from more than 1,500 health professionals for staff on general wards to be given the type of high-quality masks usually only worn in intensive care units. Public Health England (PHE) has issued guidance on what PPE staff in different settings require. It was last updatedin October 2020,external. And you canread our explainer hereon face masks, including what protection they offer, what sort can be worn, and what the rules are across the UK. A highly contagious strain of coronavirus first detected in South Africa has spread to 20 countries, the WHO says The World Health Organisation (WHO) has expressed concern about the spread of new coronavirus variants. A highly infectious strain, which originated in the UK, has now spread to 50 countries and territories, the WHO said. Since the strain was first detected late last year, it has driven a spike in coronavirus infections and deaths linked to the disease in the UK. A strain first identified in South Africa, meanwhile, has spread to 20 other countries, the WHO said. Health experts say both new variants appear to be more transmissible than previous strains but not necessarily any more dangerous. They have also played down the possibility that vaccines will not be as effective against these variants. Still, the increased transmission of these variants is taking its toll. ""Going into a second year of this [pandemic] could even be tougher given some of the transmission dynamics,"" WHO expert Mike Ryan said during an event on social media. There are also concerns about a third new strain the Japanese authorities have identified in four people who are thought to have caught it in Brazil. BBC Radio 5 Live The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has been a major plank of the government's support during the pandemic. Under the furlough scheme, the government pays up to 80% of employees' wages up to Â£2,500. But it has been found to be open to abuse. New figures from HMRC given to BBC Radio 5 Live's Wake Up to Money programme show the department ishandling more than 21,000 reportsof suspected fraudulent use of the furlough scheme, 5,000 of which are under formal investigation. The money is either due to fraudulent claims, or is being paid out in error. The number of tip offs has spiralled sincelast April, from 3,000 to 21,378 reports of suspect payments by early January. HMRC told the BBC: ""This is taxpayers' money and fraudulent claims limit our ability to support people and deprive public services of essential funding."" The DUPâs Ian Paisley has failed to trigger an emergency Commons debate on the discarding of donated kidneys during the coronavirus pandemic. The MP for North Antrim said he had heard some viable organs had been discarded, and called for transplant operations to continue, perhaps using private facilities. Deputy Speaker Eleanor Laing later told him it would be not be allowed, but said a health minister was present and listening to his request. This video can not be played Covid-19: DUP MP says donated kidney discarded in pandemic Lisa SummersBBC Scotland Health Correspondent We heard earlier from Nicola Sturgeon thatrestrictions in Scotland will tightenfrom Saturday. The Scottish government is acting now because of the strain on the health service. Its experts are warning the NHS could beoverwhelmed even under a 'stay at home' scenario,external. We've already seen two health boards postponing all non-urgent surgical procedures as an increase in Covid cases puts growing pressure on the system. The action from NHS Lanarkshire and NHS Ayrshire and Arran is showing how the numbers of Covid patients in hospital is really starting to impact on wider care. Wards that would usually treat people recovering from hip or knee replacements for example may need to be converted into Covid wards. Theatres, usually busy carrying out multiple routine surgeries will become high dependency or intensive care facilities. When staff need to be redeployed to work with Covid patients, it is not safe to carry out other routine work. These are the difficult choices many health boards will face over the coming weeks. Action required now to deal with this health emergency will have consequences later. Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva The event at Wengen is one of the most prestigious at the Ski World Cup Switzerlandâs iconic Lauberhorn ski race has been cancelled because of rising cases of Covid-19, many of them, Swiss health officials say, spread by one British tourist. The resort of Wengen, where the famous race is held, had recorded no cases of the virus until October, and only ten until mid-December. After that, cases began to shoot up, and, worryingly, sequencing revealed many of them were the new highly infectious variant first detected in the UK. Contact tracers found that 27 of the cases alone could be linked to one British tourist who recently stayed in a Wengen hotel. Wengen desperately tried to save the race, offering to close off the resort to everyone but competitors, and even closing its schools. At first Swiss health officials agreed, but when, at the start of this week yet more Covid-19 cases were recorded, they pulled the emergency brake. Wengen is devastated. The Lauberhorn is not just any race, but one of the top competitions on the Ski World Cup circuit. It is dearly loved by the Swiss, who have watched with delight as some of their own home-grown talent - such as Beat Feuz and Carlo Janka - triumphed there. Rachel SchraerBBC Health Reporter As MPs have been mentioning today - a coronavirus variant has been found circulating in the Amazonas state of Brazil, and was picked up in Japan in travellers from the region. Itâs different from the UK and South African variants, but it contains common mutations - two changes to the virusâ ""spike"" in particular which have been flagged as potentially making the virus more infectious. This is not going to be the last mutation we hear about. At the moment changes are mainly being picked up in areas that do lots of genetic tracking of the virus - itâs almost certain there are other mutations already circulating unseen in other parts of the world. And the virus will continue to mutate - itâs just a question of how, how much and how fast. For now thereâs no evidence the virus is becoming more dangerous - but if more people catch it then, left unchecked, more will potentially become ill or die. But the vaccines, which target several different areas of the virusâ spike, should still work - though thatâs something that scientists the world over will be monitoring very closely. There have now been more deaths in the second wave of the pandemic than the first, Public Health England's medical director has said. Dr Yvonne Doyle was reacting to the new record of 1,564 deaths within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus in the UK that have been announced this hour. She said: âWith each passing day, more and more people are tragically losing their lives to this terrible virus, and today we have reported the highest number of deaths on a single day since the pandemic began. ""There have now been more deaths in the second wave than the first. âAbout one-in-three people with Covid-19 donât show symptoms, but can still pass it on to others so it is essential that we stay at home, minimise contact with other people and act as if you have the virus.â Labour's chair of the Home Affairs Committee Yvette Cooper, points out loopholes for travellers arriving home from abroad - including travelling on UK public transport when coming back from a holiday destination. Mr Johnson says there is a ""balanced approach"" from the government on the health of the nation vs the health of the economy. Ms Cooper says other countries brought in negative Covid tests as a requirement to travel ""months ago"" whereas the UK is only bringing these in from Friday. Mr Johnson says 3.5m passengers have been spot-checked since June 2020. He says a ""great deal of work"" goes into checking ""passenger data forms"" to check where people have come from. Ms Cooper says over 90% of those passenger data forms are not being checked. She says these checks ""might as well be voluntary"". Mr Johnson replies that those arriving from abroad are being screened. Ms Cooper asks why people from Brazil are not being checked for Covid, considering that there is a new strain in the South American country which could undermine the UK's vaccination programme. ""We are taking steps to ensure"" that the UK doesn't see the new variant in Brazil coming to the UK, replies Mr Johnson.

Where are Scotland's latest cases?,"The number of Covid-19 infections in Scotland has risen, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). TheONS Covid infection survey,externalestimates an average of219,600people were infected on any given day in the week up to 31 December - that's aboutone in 25 people. Figures from theNational Records of Scotland,externalalso show there were81Covid deaths in the week ending 8 January, which is higher than the previous week. A total of16,465people in Scotland have died with Covid since the outbreak began in March 2020. This page analyses the key figures for the Covid pandemic in Scotland and is updated weekly. The ONS has been carrying out a Covid infection survey of randomly selected households in Scotland since September 2020. Nowmass testing has ended, it has become the best estimate of the extent of the coronavirus outbreak in Scotland. The pandemic has created a huge load on Scotland's hospitals. At the peak of the outbreak in spring 2020, there were more than 1,500 Covid patients in hospital, with more than 200 being treated in intensive care. Numbers reduced over the summer of 2020, but started to rise steadily again in the autumn. In January 2021, the number of patients with Covid in hospital went above 2,000. During the Omicron surge in cases in early 2022, the total number of patients with Covid surpassed the 2021 peak. However, the numbers being treated in intensive care are lower than they were early in the pandemic. The first Covid-19 death in Scotlandwas reported by NHS Lothian on 13 March 2020. The spring outbreak peaked in mid-April 2020 and then mainly declined until the summer, when deaths remained at a relatively low level. The rate of new deaths rose again in the autumn of 2020 as the second wave of the pandemic took hold, finally peaking at the end of January 2021. The number of deaths in subsequent waves of Covid infections peaked at much lower levels, but deaths are still occurring. There are two ways to count total deaths from Covid-19.The National Records of Scotland (NRS) reports all death certificates that mention Covid-19, even if the person has not been tested for the virus. The NRS also publishes data on excess deaths,compared with a five-year average,external. Excess deaths from most causes rose in 2020and in 2021. The exception in both years has been deaths from respiratory diseases, which have seen lower than average excess deaths.

Battery lodged in baby's throat for four months,"The button battery was stuck in Sofia-Grace's throat for four months An 11-month-old girl who was rejecting solid food had a button battery lodged in her throat for four months. Doctors thought Sofia-Grace Hill had tonsillitis or a viral infection until an X-ray revealed the battery the size of a 10p in her oesophagus. She underwent a two-hour operation to remove it and is now on a liquid only diet. A surgeon said her survival may be due to the battery being old and without charge. Dad Calham, from Swindon, first noticed something was wrong in January 2020 and had countless paramedic call-outs and visits to the GP and local hospital. She had a two-hour operation to remove the battery He was convinced there was something else going on as Sofia-Grace would only eat pureed food. After another hospital trip in May, she was given an X-ray which showed the battery lodged in her oesophagus was causing serious damage as it had corroded. Mr Hill said: ""I was gutted when I saw it and angry at myself. I blamed myself, but now I realise there was nothing we could have done to know."" The button battery is the size of a 10p Sofia-Grace had a feeding tube fitted to help her with food and to stop her throat from closing. Every two weeks she has a general anaesthetic to stretch her oesophagus but faces the prospect of further surgery. How long does it take to poo Lego out if a child eats it? Mr Hill said: ""The damage has left a pocket in her oesophagus which needs to close but Sofia is improving week by week with regular dilations which is improving her oesophagus. ""But I know the chance of survival in the first weeks after this happens is very low so we are moving in the right direction."" Sofia-Grace is improving week by week, her dad said Mr Hill is unsure how Sofia-Grace, now almost two-years-old, got hold of the button battery and warned parents about the dangers. He said: ""Just get rid of them or lock them away and don't give your child car keys to play with. Always trust your instincts as a parent."" Janet McNally, consultant paediatric surgeon at Bristol Royal Hospital for Children, who is treating Sofia-Grace, said her survival may be because the battery was old and had lost its charge. She said that without someone seeing a child swallow a battery or obvious symptoms it was not unusual for it to be missed. ""Clinicians and the government have been warning of the dangers of button batteries for a long time. But not all parents are aware of how dangerous they can be.

What are Scotland's six new lockdown rules?,"Changes to Scotland's lockdown restrictions have been announced. The tightening of the rules follows concerns the ""stay at home"" message is not having the same impact it did during last year's lockdown. The changes will come into effect on Saturday. Follow the latest coronavirus news Tightening of Scottish lockdown rules announced The availability and operation of click and collect services will be limited to retailers selling essential items such as clothes, footwear, baby equipment, homeware and books. Also, outlets that sell electrical goods; do key cutting; undertake shoe repairs, plus garden centres and plant nurseries can continue the collect service. For qualifying businesses, staggered appointments will need to be offered to avoid any potential for queuing, and access inside premises for collection will not be permitted. Analysis: Business clicks but doesnât collect Customers in Scotland will no longer be allowed to go inside to collect takeaway food or coffee. Businesses will have to operate from a serving hatch or doorway. The aim is to reduce the risk of customers coming into contact indoors with each other, or with staff. It will be against the law in all level four areas of Scotland to drink alcohol outdoors in public. This will mean that buying a takeaway pint and consuming on the street will not be permitted. It is intended to underline the message that people should only be leaving home for essential purposes. The Scottish government is strengthening the obligation on employers to allow their staff to work from home whenever possible. The law already says that people should only be leaving home to go to work if it is work that cannot be done from home. This is a legal obligation that falls on individuals. However, statutory guidance is being introduced to make clear that employers should support employees to work from home wherever possible. The Scottish government is strengthening provisions in relation to work inside people's houses. Current guidance says that in level four areas work is only permitted within a private dwelling if it is essential for the upkeep, maintenance and functioning of the household.  This guidance is now being put into law. The final change is an amendment to the regulations requiring people to stay at home. This is intended to close an apparent loophole rather than change the spirit of the law. It will also bring the wording of the stay at home regulations in Scotland into line with the other UK nations. Currently the law states that people can only leave home for an essential purpose. The amendment will make it clear that people ""must not leave or remain outside"" the home unless it is for an essential purpose.

"Media billionaire David Barclay dies, aged 86","David (right) and Frederick Barclay receiving their knighthoods in 2000 Sir David Barclay, the co-owner of the Daily Telegraph newspaper, has died at the age of 86. Sir David, together with his twin brother Sir Frederick, built up a business empire spanning hotels, retail and media. His death was announced in the Telegraph, which reported that he died on Sunday after a short illness. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, a former columnist for the paper, paid tribute to Sir David. ""Farewell with respect and admiration to Sir David Barclay who rescued a great newspaper, created many thousands of jobs across the UK and who believed passionately in the independence of this country and what it could achieve,"" he tweeted. The Barclay brothers, who had an estimated wealth of Â£7bn according to the 2020 Sunday Times Rich List, were known for being media shy and rarely gave interviews. Billionaireâs nephew 'caught with bugging device' Who are the Barclay brothers? Ritz 'paying no corporation tax' Barclay brothers wind up island work Born in Hammersmith, west London, in 1934, Sir David was profoundly shaped by his childhood memories of war, and the death of his father when he was 12. He and his twin Frederick - who was 10 minutes younger - started out as painters and decorators, before moving into property and eventually hotels. Their success in property and hotels helped them take over Ellerman Lines, a shipping business with interests in brewing, in 1983. This provided a launch pad from which they would become billionaires. At various times, their hotel portfolio has included a number of trophy assets, including the Ritz Hotel in London, which they sold in March last year. In 2012, the BBCâs Panorama reported that the Ritz had not paid any corporation tax since it had been taken over by the Barclays in 1995. At the time, Sir David said they had âacted in a responsible way with regard to taxation and have never been involved in any tax avoidance scheme.â In 2015, the twins sold off the hospitality group Maybourne, which included luxury hotels like Claridges. The brothers first ventured into media ownership with their 1992 purchase of The European, a pan-European newspaper that shut down in 1998. They also bought The Scotsman in 1995 and Sunday Business in 1997. âAfter these ventures in the publishing arena, the brothers had nurtured since the 1980s an ambition to own the Telegraph group,â The Telegraph said. They acquired the Telegraph Group in 2004 for Â£665m from Canadian media magnate Conrad Black's Hollinger group. The brothers also had a number of forays into retail, including Shop Direct, fashion retailer Very and delivery firm Yodel. The pair were knighted in 2000 for services to charity. By this point their foundation was thought to have donated about Â£40m to charity and medical research. The notoriously private twins' relationship was the subject of an extraordinary legal case last year, in which Sir David's three sons were accused by his brother of bugging conversations at the Ritz Hotel, which they previously owned. In its obituary the Telegraph said Sir David had been a voracious reader, obsessed with newspapers, business, economics and politics, and had always said he had been educated at the ""university of life"".

The Scottish Greens' Patrick Harvie asks the first minister about support for those who need to self-isolate. A more proactive approach is needed to help people to do the right thing, Mr Harvie adds. He points out that generally people want to comply with the rules. The first minister says eligibility criteria for support grants has been extended and that outreach services are available through local authorities. ""There is not a suggestion that people are not"" self-isolating, the FM adds. Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie says the full capacity of the gold-standard PCR tests is not being used. Why are we not using the full capacity to find as many cases as possible? Ms Sturgeon says PCR tests are used for testing everyone with symptoms. She says turnaround times are extremely good and it's important that capacity is available when it's needed for those who have symptoms. She says mass testing for those who don't have symptoms is generally most effectively carried out through a different route - using lateral flow tests - which are not as sensitive at detecting the virus. Mr Rennie says the government is great at making announcements about testing but is poor at delivering on them. We should be using the gold standard tests to hunt down the people in our community who have the virus but don't know it. Willie Rennie, Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Richard Leonard says in the past four weeks Scotland has carried out fewer tests per 100,000 than any other nation of the UK. The Scottish Labour leader quotes Mark Woolhouse, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at Edinburgh University, who says ""we are only finding half, or even less than half of the cases. This is like fighting the epidemic with one arm behind our back"". He asks when the community roll out of mass testing will happen The first minister suspects the figures Mr Leonard is using are from the demand-led testing schemes. The numbers are lower in Scotland than the rest of the UK is because the prevalence of the virus is lower here, she explains. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The Scottish government will seek to close a loophole allowing people to do non-essential things during lockdown. Nicola Sturgeon said regulations would be changed, forbidding people from leaving home for an essential purpose and then doing something considered not to be essential after they have left the house. It does mean that if the police challenge you for being out of the house doing something that is not essential, it will not be a defence to say you initially left the house to do something that was essential. Nicola Sturgeon, First Minister The Scottish Conservatives' Ruth Davidson asks if businesses that are affected by today's changes will be given extra financial support, and asks where the evidence is to back up the changes. Ms Sturgeon says an evidence paper is due to be published, but adds that because community prevalence is so high - due to the new variant - all interactions between people have to be minimised. ""There is significant money available, much of it already with businesses and much more of it flowing to businesses over the course of this month,"" the first minister insists. She adds that she will continue to look at what the Scottish government can do ""within its resources"". The first minister told MSPs in Holyrood that statutory guidance would now be introduced urging employers to support workers to remain at home ""wherever possible"". Guidance previously issued to only allow essential work in people's houses will now be placed into law, Ms Sturgeon added. We have already issued guidance to the effect that in Level 4 areas work is only permitted within a private dwelling if it is essential for the upkeep, maintenance and functioning of the household. We will now put this guidance into law, Nicola Sturgeon, First Minister The first minister says today's measures are a ""regrettable but necessary means to an end"". Ms Sturgeon points out that although these are dark and difficult times, there are also grounds for hope. She says there are early signs the lockdown is having an affect so ""we must stick with it"". The first minister says vaccination will protect many more in the weeks and months ahead. She concludes none of us are powerless in the face of this virus as we can behave in a way that reduces the risk of passing it on. ""Please stick to the spirit and not just the letter of these rules."" Interactions should be minimised and in anything we do we should assume we have the virus and follow FACTS. ""At this critical and dangerous moment please Stay Home, Protect the NHS, Save Lives."" The first minister has set out new restrictions designed to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. From Saturday, only shops selling essential items will be allowed to offer click and collect services and customers won't be able to go into takeaway food and drinks venues. Allow Twitter content?

The first minister warns pressure on the NHS is likely to increase further and continue for some time. Ms Sturgeon says last week saw the highest number of registered deaths from Covid since early May. The case numbers must be reduced to relieve pressure on the NHS and save lives, she says . That is why the cabinet is further tightening the lockdown restrictions. The first minister says: ""For now of course we are in a race against the virus. ""To win the race we must complete the vaccination programme as quickly as possible and that is what we will do. ""But we must also slow down the virus."" Ms Sturgeon says the new variant is spreading rapidly making up 60% of new cases and is making it more difficult to get the R number below one without severe restrictions. There are some signs lockdown may be having some affect, appearing to slow down and stabalise new cases. The first minister outlines Scotland's vaccination programme and highlights: Â© 2025 BBC.

"Media billionaire David Barclay dies, aged 86Together with his twin brother, Sir David built a business empire spanning hotels, retail and newspapers.","David (right) and Frederick Barclay receiving their knighthoods in 2000 Sir David Barclay, the co-owner of the Daily Telegraph newspaper, has died at the age of 86.

Battery lodged in baby's throat for four monthsDoctors believed 11-month-old Sofia-Grace Hill was rejecting food because she had tonsillitis.Wiltshire,"The button battery was stuck in Sofia-Grace's throat for four months An 11-month-old girl who was rejecting solid food had a button battery lodged in her throat for four months. Doctors thought Sofia-Grace Hill had tonsillitis or a viral infection until an X-ray revealed the battery the size of a 10p in her oesophagus. She underwent a two-hour operation to remove it and is now on a liquid only diet. A surgeon said her survival may be due to the battery being old and without charge. Dad Calham, from Swindon, first noticed something was wrong in January 2020 and had countless paramedic call-outs and visits to the GP and local hospital. She had a two-hour operation to remove the battery He was convinced there was something else going on as Sofia-Grace would only eat pureed food. After another hospital trip in May, she was given an X-ray which showed the battery lodged in her oesophagus was causing serious damage as it had corroded. Mr Hill said: ""I was gutted when I saw it and angry at myself. I blamed myself, but now I realise there was nothing we could have done to know."" The button battery is the size of a 10p Sofia-Grace had a feeding tube fitted to help her with food and to stop her throat from closing. Every two weeks she has a general anaesthetic to stretch her oesophagus but faces the prospect of further surgery. How long does it take to poo Lego out if a child eats it? Mr Hill said: ""The damage has left a pocket in her oesophagus which needs to close but Sofia is improving week by week with regular dilations which is improving her oesophagus. ""But I know the chance of survival in the first weeks after this happens is very low so we are moving in the right direction."" Sofia-Grace is improving week by week, her dad said Mr Hill is unsure how Sofia-Grace, now almost two-years-old, got hold of the button battery and warned parents about the dangers. He said: ""Just get rid of them or lock them away and don't give your child car keys to play with. Always trust your instincts as a parent."" Janet McNally, consultant paediatric surgeon at Bristol Royal Hospital for Children, who is treating Sofia-Grace, said her survival may be because the battery was old and had lost its charge. She said that without someone seeing a child swallow a battery or obvious symptoms it was not unusual for it to be missed. ""Clinicians and the government have been warning of the dangers of button batteries for a long time. But not all parents are aware of how dangerous they can be.

Online education 'patchy and inconsistent',"This video can not be played 'Given the choice, I think they'd rather be back in the classroom', said Nick Langston Online education is ""patchy and inconsistent"" and there should be a clearer national approach, according to Wales' future generations commissioner. Sophie Howe said the Welsh Government should do more to ensure consistency of learning by schools across Wales. Schools areset to remain closeduntil at least the end of January, with teaching delivered remotely. The Welsh Government said it had been commended for the way it had provided devices to access online learning. Ms Howe said ""real leadership from the top"" was needed along with clarity about what parents should expect regarding ""how many hours, what type of work, how we should be using digital platforms, and indeed how best to support parents to facilitate all of that"". She said a chief digital officer for education was needed. ""What we're seeing at the moment is parents having to compete with multiple different platforms. I think I counted about six or seven that my four children are on,"" she said. ""It does seem that some schools are offering face-to-face virtual lessons, some are just offering worksheets and so on."" The Welsh Government said it had successfully providedlaptops and MiFi devices to familieswho were struggling to access online learning, plus guidance and training for teachers. It confirmed there was no legal duty on schools in Wales to deliver a minimum amount of online teaching after schools in England were told it would be mandatory to deliverthree to five hours of remote learningper day - a duty overseen by school inspectors. The Welsh Government said the inspectorate, Estyn, was not formally overseeing the delivery of remote learning in Wales but had been part of a Blended Learning Working Group which also involved regional education consortia and local authorities. Guidance to schools says pupils should generally receive ""the duration of learning time they would receive were they in school"". Lisa and Nick Langston have been helping their children with home schooling Children home-schooling 'denied laptops by schools' Q&A: What are Wales' lockdown rules? Nick Langston, a professional guitarist from Chepstow, Monmouthshire, and his wife Lisa, a solicitor, are helping home school their two young children. Their eight-year-old son is required to complete one piece of literacy and numeracy, and another topic every day which is set online and then sent back to teachers to be marked. Nick said: ""We were concerned initially that we'd be expected to be teaching the kids for six hours a day, which would have been quite a challenge. ""But, actually, the big focus seems to be on making sure the kids' reading and writing keep going, and their numbers keep going, and then they've given us flexibility."" Lisa said the communication from the primary school has been ""fantastic"". She said: ""They respond really quickly which is great because obviously they've got a lot of children to respond to, and they're very positive in their comments and encouraging and pushing the children along. ""There's a real interaction between the kids and the teacher which has been great."" Henry said he's found completing school work from home ""good"" but sometimes ""stressful"" Nick and Lisa's eight-year-old son Henry said he found doing his school work at home ""good"" although it could be ""a bit stressful doing it"". He said he had been completing maths, spelling and work learning about the forest, at home. ""It gets my brain working through the day. ""But it has been a bit annoying because everybody is talking and you have to concentrate to do work,"" he said. Jackson and his younger sister Mari have been learning at home for A-levels and GCSEs Meanwhile 17-year-old A-level student Jackson said the lesson work he is set was ""not that different"" to when he was in school. ""It varies for each lesson, ranging from 15 minutes to the entire hour,"" he said. Rhian Lundigran, head teacher at Glan yr Afon and Bryn Hafod primary schools in Llanrumney, Cardiff, said it is easier to plan for remote learning now schools know they will be closed for some weeks. Having handed out 300 devices and 200 dongles during the first lockdown, a further seven were distributed last week to families whose circumstances had changed. She said a mix of daily ""meets"" with the class teacher, along with setting tasks online, works well. ""We're very aware of children's wellbeing and parents' wellbeing,"" she added. ""We're also aware that teachers have their own children trying to learn at home while they're working at home, and it's trying to get that balance between wellbeing and learning online. ""Every school is different, every family has different circumstances and there are strengths I'm sure in many different schools, but to share that good practice would be really effective and would reduce the workload of teachers."" ""Face-to-face learning is the best way and anything that can replicate that, remotely, needs to be the focus,"" said Plaid education spokesperson Sian Gwenllian The huge challenges of home-schooling BBC's bilingual lessons for home-schooling parents Plaid Cymru said the Welsh Government needed a plan to get rid of a ""postcode lottery"" of provision and the government should provide clear expectations for teachers to address inconsistencies ""from school to school and pupil to pupil"". ""There should be a clearer expectation on schools [and] teachers coming from the Welsh Government that remote learning has to be ramped up. There should be national expectations set out that does include remote learning,"" said education spokesperson Sian Gwenllian. ""Obviously, face-to-face learning is the best way and anything that can replicate that, remotely, needs to be the focus - so live streaming of lessons and individual lessons between smaller groups."" The Welsh Conservatives said the situation had improved since schools were closed in March but the picture was still ""not very consistent"". Estyn boss Meilyr Rowlands: Distance learning provision ""becoming less variable than during the first lockdown"" ""I think there's a case to be made for a minimum number of hours, but without being prescriptive about what those hours are used for because teachers are best placed to know how individual classes would work,"" said the party's education spokesperson Suzy Davies. She said the regional education consortia should have a role in monitoring the quality of provision and ""supervising and supporting teachers"". The schools watchdog Estyn said provision was becoming ""less variable"" than during the first lockdown. Meilyr Rowlands, chief inspector of education, said education staff had risen to the challenges posed by the pandemic. ""The periods of learning from home has meant that all schools have had to think afresh about how pupils learn and how face-to-face teaching can best promote resilience and independent learning skills,"" he said. ""Overall, the education and training system is now better prepared for distance learning and the provision is becoming less variable than during the first lockdown. ""As a result, schools and other providers are planning to implement more extensive programmes of live-streamed and pre-recorded lessons for learners during the current lockdown period."" Most children will be learning from home until at least February half-term, unless there is a big drop in Covid cases Eithne Hughes, director of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) Cymru, said schools were now in a far better position than at the outset of the pandemic to deliver remote teaching. ""We will also be talking to the Welsh Government about how schools can be best supported in order to ensure this provision is of the highest quality,"" she said. ""However, the success or otherwise of remote education is not entirely within their power. ""Some children will not have access to a laptop or tablet, or will have to share access, or will not have a stable internet connection, or a quiet space in their homes.""

MSPs will shortly take evidence from teaching unions, the SQA and Education Scotland on education during the pandemic. You can watch the evidence session here on this live page with us from 2.30pm. The Archbishop of Glasgow, Philip Tartaglia, has died suddenly at his home in Glasgow. A spokeswoman for the Catholic Church said that Archbishop Tartagliahad tested positive for Covid-19 shortly after Christmasand was self-isolating at home. The cause of death is not yet clear. Archbishop Tartaglia, who was 70, was ordained a priest in 1975 and served as Archbishop of Glasgow since 2012. The spokeswoman said it would be for Pope Francis to appoint a new archbishop, but until then the Archdiocese will be overseen by an administrator. Changes to Scotland's lockdown restrictions have been announced. The tightening of the rules follows concerns the ""stay at home"" message is not having the same impact it did during last year's lockdown. The changes will come into effect on Saturday and affect:  Click here to find out all the details.  The Scottish Greens' Patrick Harvie asks the first minister about support for those who need to self-isolate. A more proactive approach is needed to help people to do the right thing, Mr Harvie adds. He points out that generally people want to comply with the rules. The first minister says eligibility criteria for support grants has been extended and that outreach services are available through local authorities. ""There is not a suggestion that people are not"" self-isolating, the FM adds. Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie says the full capacity of the gold-standard PCR tests is not being used. Why are we not using the full capacity to find as many cases as possible? Ms Sturgeon says PCR tests are used for testing everyone with symptoms. She says turnaround times are extremely good and it's important that capacity is available when it's needed for those who have symptoms. She says mass testing for those who don't have symptoms is generally most effectively carried out through a different route - using lateral flow tests - which are not as sensitive at detecting the virus. Mr Rennie says the government is great at making announcements about testing but is poor at delivering on them. We should be using the gold standard tests to hunt down the people in our community who have the virus but don't know it. Willie Rennie, Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Richard Leonard says in the past four weeks Scotland has carried out fewer tests per 100,000 than any other nation of the UK. The Scottish Labour leader quotes Mark Woolhouse, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at Edinburgh University, who says ""we are only finding half, or even less than half of the cases. This is like fighting the epidemic with one arm behind our back"". He asks when the community roll out of mass testing will happen The first minister suspects the figures Mr Leonard is using are from the demand-led testing schemes. The numbers are lower in Scotland than the rest of the UK is because the prevalence of the virus is lower here, she explains. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The Scottish government will seek to close a loophole allowing people to do non-essential things during lockdown. Nicola Sturgeon said regulations would be changed, forbidding people from leaving home for an essential purpose and then doing something considered not to be essential after they have left the house. It does mean that if the police challenge you for being out of the house doing something that is not essential, it will not be a defence to say you initially left the house to do something that was essential. Nicola Sturgeon, First Minister The Scottish Conservatives' Ruth Davidson asks if businesses that are affected by today's changes will be given extra financial support, and asks where the evidence is to back up the changes. Ms Sturgeon says an evidence paper is due to be published, but adds that because community prevalence is so high - due to the new variant - all interactions between people have to be minimised. ""There is significant money available, much of it already with businesses and much more of it flowing to businesses over the course of this month,"" the first minister insists. She adds that she will continue to look at what the Scottish government can do ""within its resources"". The first minister told MSPs in Holyrood that statutory guidance would now be introduced urging employers to support workers to remain at home ""wherever possible"". Guidance previously issued to only allow essential work in people's houses will now be placed into law, Ms Sturgeon added. We have already issued guidance to the effect that in Level 4 areas work is only permitted within a private dwelling if it is essential for the upkeep, maintenance and functioning of the household. We will now put this guidance into law, Nicola Sturgeon, First Minister The first minister says today's measures are a ""regrettable but necessary means to an end"". Ms Sturgeon points out that although these are dark and difficult times, there are also grounds for hope. She says there are early signs the lockdown is having an affect so ""we must stick with it"". The first minister says vaccination will protect many more in the weeks and months ahead. She concludes none of us are powerless in the face of this virus as we can behave in a way that reduces the risk of passing it on. ""Please stick to the spirit and not just the letter of these rules."" Interactions should be minimised and in anything we do we should assume we have the virus and follow FACTS. ""At this critical and dangerous moment please Stay Home, Protect the NHS, Save Lives."" The first minister has set out new restrictions designed to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. From Saturday, only shops selling essential items will be allowed to offer click and collect services and customers won't be able to go into takeaway food and drinks venues. Allow Twitter content?

The first minister warns pressure on the NHS is likely to increase further and continue for some time. Ms Sturgeon says last week saw the highest number of registered deaths from Covid since early May. The case numbers must be reduced to relieve pressure on the NHS and save lives, she says . That is why the cabinet is further tightening the lockdown restrictions. The first minister says: ""For now of course we are in a race against the virus. ""To win the race we must complete the vaccination programme as quickly as possible and that is what we will do. ""But we must also slow down the virus."" Ms Sturgeon says the new variant is spreading rapidly making up 60% of new cases and is making it more difficult to get the R number below one without severe restrictions. There are some signs lockdown may be having some affect, appearing to slow down and stabalise new cases. The first minister outlines Scotland's vaccination programme and highlights: Â© 2025 BBC.

There's been a lot of coronavirus news around today - here are some of the main headlines: Jordan has launched a Covid-19 vaccination programme intended
to protect more than 20% of the kingdomâs 10 million population. The government has said the first stage will focus on people
over the age of 60, those with chronic illnesses, and medical personnel. It aims
to administer 5,000 shots a day at 29 centres. Health Minister Nazir Obeidattold the state news agency Petra,externalthat the first day had gone âsmoothlyâ. But the head of the ministryâs epidemics and communicable
diseases department, Wael Hayajneh,urged more people to register for the free vaccines,external, with
only 200,000 reportedly signed up since late December. The government has purchased vaccines produced by Pfizer-BioNTech
and China's Sinopharm. The latter was granted an âemergency licenceâ on Saturday. Jordan has seen a sharp fall in the daily number of new
infections since mid-November, when restrictions that
had been eased during the summer were reintroduced. More than 309,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19
and 4,076 deaths have been reported since the start of the pandemic. There's been focus this week on whether people are adhering to the rules around wearing face coverings in shops. Tesco, Asda and Waitrose have becomethe latest supermarkets to say they will deny entry to shoppers who do not wear face masks,  unless they are medically exempt. It follows a similar move by Morrisons, while Sainsbury's says it will challenge those who flout the rules. So what protection do masks offer, what sort can be worn, and what are the rules across the UK? Read our explainer here The education select committee chairman has asked the PM for the roadmap for reopening schools in England. Robert Halfon asked the prime minister about the mental health and social isolation effects on children being away from schools. Boris Johnson says the lockdown measures âhave got to continue to workâ, after showing âsome early signs of progressâ. But he says it was âfar, far too earlyâ to say that would lead to a relaxation next month. This video can not be played Covid-19: Johnson and Halfon on lockdown effect on children Gavin StampBBC political reporter The UK governmentâs Covid O
committee is expected to discuss the new variant of coronavirus that has
emerged in Brazil tomorrow. The prime minister hinted to MPs that there could be restrictions on travel from Brazil to the UK - but a final decision has not been taken. Speaking to MPs he said: ""We are taking steps to ensure that we do not see
the import of this new variant from Brazil."" The Catholic Archbishop of Glasgow has died after contracting Covid-19 shortly after Christmas. Philip Tartaglia, 70, was one of the most senior figures in the Catholic Church in Scotland. The Church said his cause of death was not yet clear. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she felt ""deep sadness"" to hear of Archbishop Tartaglia's death. She told Scottish Parliament: ""I'm sure that is sadness shared by everybody across this chamber - and to send my deepest condolences to his loved ones and of course everybody in his community."" Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf said he had ""many fond memories"" of conversations he had shared with the archbishop. Philip Tartaglia was born in Glasgow in 1951 and was appointed Archbishop of Glasgow in 2012. He died on 13 January, which is the Feast of St Mungo - the patron saint of Glasgow. More than 9.3 million of Americans have received the first shot of a Covid vaccine The US has been by far the world's worst-hit nation in the pandemic, with Johns Hopkins University reporting late on Tuesday a record 4,470 Covid-related deaths in the past 24 hours. Here are the latest key developments in America on Wednesday:  The US has had more than 22 million confirmed infections since the start of the outbreak, according to Johns Hopkins. The overall Covid-related death toll has now exceeded 380,000, and is closing in fast on the number of American soldiers killed in World War Two, at about 407,000. Doctors' leaders have called for urgent improvements in personal protective equipment for health workers. The British Medical Association isappealing for a higher grade of face maskto guard against coronavirus infection. It says there is 'growing evidence' that the virus is being spread through the air by aerosols. These are tiny virus particles that can build up in stuffy rooms and they have been linked to outbreaks of Covid-19. This follows an open letter from more than 1,500 health professionals for staff on general wards to be given the type of high-quality masks usually only worn in intensive care units. Public Health England (PHE) has issued guidance on what PPE staff in different settings require. It was last updatedin October 2020,external. And you canread our explainer hereon face masks, including what protection they offer, what sort can be worn, and what the rules are across the UK. A highly contagious strain of coronavirus first detected in South Africa has spread to 20 countries, the WHO says The World Health Organisation (WHO) has expressed concern about the spread of new coronavirus variants. A highly infectious strain, which originated in the UK, has now spread to 50 countries and territories, the WHO said. Since the strain was first detected late last year, it has driven a spike in coronavirus infections and deaths linked to the disease in the UK. A strain first identified in South Africa, meanwhile, has spread to 20 other countries, the WHO said. Health experts say both new variants appear to be more transmissible than previous strains but not necessarily any more dangerous. They have also played down the possibility that vaccines will not be as effective against these variants. Still, the increased transmission of these variants is taking its toll. ""Going into a second year of this [pandemic] could even be tougher given some of the transmission dynamics,"" WHO expert Mike Ryan said during an event on social media. There are also concerns about a third new strain the Japanese authorities have identified in four people who are thought to have caught it in Brazil. BBC Radio 5 Live The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has been a major plank of the government's support during the pandemic. Under the furlough scheme, the government pays up to 80% of employees' wages up to Â£2,500. But it has been found to be open to abuse. New figures from HMRC given to BBC Radio 5 Live's Wake Up to Money programme show the department ishandling more than 21,000 reportsof suspected fraudulent use of the furlough scheme, 5,000 of which are under formal investigation. The money is either due to fraudulent claims, or is being paid out in error. The number of tip offs has spiralled sincelast April, from 3,000 to 21,378 reports of suspect payments by early January. HMRC told the BBC: ""This is taxpayers' money and fraudulent claims limit our ability to support people and deprive public services of essential funding."" The DUPâs Ian Paisley has failed to trigger an emergency Commons debate on the discarding of donated kidneys during the coronavirus pandemic. The MP for North Antrim said he had heard some viable organs had been discarded, and called for transplant operations to continue, perhaps using private facilities. Deputy Speaker Eleanor Laing later told him it would be not be allowed, but said a health minister was present and listening to his request. This video can not be played Covid-19: DUP MP says donated kidney discarded in pandemic Lisa SummersBBC Scotland Health Correspondent We heard earlier from Nicola Sturgeon thatrestrictions in Scotland will tightenfrom Saturday. The Scottish government is acting now because of the strain on the health service. Its experts are warning the NHS could beoverwhelmed even under a 'stay at home' scenario,external. We've already seen two health boards postponing all non-urgent surgical procedures as an increase in Covid cases puts growing pressure on the system. The action from NHS Lanarkshire and NHS Ayrshire and Arran is showing how the numbers of Covid patients in hospital is really starting to impact on wider care. Wards that would usually treat people recovering from hip or knee replacements for example may need to be converted into Covid wards. Theatres, usually busy carrying out multiple routine surgeries will become high dependency or intensive care facilities. When staff need to be redeployed to work with Covid patients, it is not safe to carry out other routine work. These are the difficult choices many health boards will face over the coming weeks. Action required now to deal with this health emergency will have consequences later. Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva The event at Wengen is one of the most prestigious at the Ski World Cup Switzerlandâs iconic Lauberhorn ski race has been cancelled because of rising cases of Covid-19, many of them, Swiss health officials say, spread by one British tourist. The resort of Wengen, where the famous race is held, had recorded no cases of the virus until October, and only ten until mid-December. After that, cases began to shoot up, and, worryingly, sequencing revealed many of them were the new highly infectious variant first detected in the UK. Contact tracers found that 27 of the cases alone could be linked to one British tourist who recently stayed in a Wengen hotel. Wengen desperately tried to save the race, offering to close off the resort to everyone but competitors, and even closing its schools. At first Swiss health officials agreed, but when, at the start of this week yet more Covid-19 cases were recorded, they pulled the emergency brake. Wengen is devastated. The Lauberhorn is not just any race, but one of the top competitions on the Ski World Cup circuit. It is dearly loved by the Swiss, who have watched with delight as some of their own home-grown talent - such as Beat Feuz and Carlo Janka - triumphed there. Rachel SchraerBBC Health Reporter As MPs have been mentioning today - a coronavirus variant has been found circulating in the Amazonas state of Brazil, and was picked up in Japan in travellers from the region. Itâs different from the UK and South African variants, but it contains common mutations - two changes to the virusâ ""spike"" in particular which have been flagged as potentially making the virus more infectious. This is not going to be the last mutation we hear about. At the moment changes are mainly being picked up in areas that do lots of genetic tracking of the virus - itâs almost certain there are other mutations already circulating unseen in other parts of the world. And the virus will continue to mutate - itâs just a question of how, how much and how fast. For now thereâs no evidence the virus is becoming more dangerous - but if more people catch it then, left unchecked, more will potentially become ill or die. But the vaccines, which target several different areas of the virusâ spike, should still work - though thatâs something that scientists the world over will be monitoring very closely. There have now been more deaths in the second wave of the pandemic than the first, Public Health England's medical director has said. Dr Yvonne Doyle was reacting to the new record of 1,564 deaths within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus in the UK that have been announced this hour. She said: âWith each passing day, more and more people are tragically losing their lives to this terrible virus, and today we have reported the highest number of deaths on a single day since the pandemic began. ""There have now been more deaths in the second wave than the first. âAbout one-in-three people with Covid-19 donât show symptoms, but can still pass it on to others so it is essential that we stay at home, minimise contact with other people and act as if you have the virus.â Labour's chair of the Home Affairs Committee Yvette Cooper, points out loopholes for travellers arriving home from abroad - including travelling on UK public transport when coming back from a holiday destination. Mr Johnson says there is a ""balanced approach"" from the government on the health of the nation vs the health of the economy. Ms Cooper says other countries brought in negative Covid tests as a requirement to travel ""months ago"" whereas the UK is only bringing these in from Friday. Mr Johnson says 3.5m passengers have been spot-checked since June 2020. He says a ""great deal of work"" goes into checking ""passenger data forms"" to check where people have come from. Ms Cooper says over 90% of those passenger data forms are not being checked. She says these checks ""might as well be voluntary"". Mr Johnson replies that those arriving from abroad are being screened. Ms Cooper asks why people from Brazil are not being checked for Covid, considering that there is a new strain in the South American country which could undermine the UK's vaccination programme. ""We are taking steps to ensure"" that the UK doesn't see the new variant in Brazil coming to the UK, replies Mr Johnson. Caroline Nokes, who chairs Parliament's Women and Equalities Commitee, then asks the PM about access to healthcare during the pandemic. She says the evidence shows it is women who are finding accessing services difficult, referring to a constituent who said her surgery was not currently doing smear tests. Nokes asks the PM what is an acceptable wait for a smear test? The PM says he sympathises with anybody who has had their treatment delayed. ""Sadly, that's what we are seeing. We're seeing delays in cancer, we're seeing delays in smear tests and vital services that people need, and that's a result in the increase in the numbers of Covid patients and that's why we have to work flat out to get the virus under control and reduce the current wave and give people the service we need."" Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Perhaps the most distressing element about the latest Covid deaths is that the numbers are almost certainly going to rise from here. People who are dying now are likely to have been infected around three weeks ago. That was at a point when infection rates were rising quite steeply, so in the coming days and weeks we should, sadly, expect to see more deaths than this. Todayâs figures are affected by the weekend, which sees delays reporting deaths that tend to translate into higher figures from Tuesday onwards. Currently around 800 to 900 people a day on average are dying once you take this into account. But the figures also provide some hope. For the third day, in a row the number of newly diagnosed infections are well below 50,000. There had been several days where they have exceeded 60,000. If that trend continues, and the number of new cases keeps coming down, that will eventually translate into the number of deaths falling. But it is going to take some weeks for that to happen. These are, as many have been saying, the darkest days of the pandemic so far. Caroline Nokes, who chairs Parliament's Women and Equalities Committee, asks the PM what additional protections are being put in place to help victims of domestic abuse who have insecure immigration status. The PM says the government has done ""what we can"" since the start of the pandemic to encourage victims of domestic abuse to come forward, including setting up helplines and investing in independent domestic abuse advisers. He says lockdown rules don't apply to victims of domestic abuse. Nokes follows up by asking why a better job is not being done of explaining lockdown rules to vulnerable people - for example, those who rely on British Sign Language or who might have learning difficulties. The PM says he has been asked a couple of times about sign language in particular, and he is going to ""take that away and see what we can do to increase sign language"". He adds that campaigns the government have produced are available in accessible formats and translations. Â© 2025 BBC.

MSPs will shortly take evidence from teaching unions, the SQA and Education Scotland on education during the pandemic. You can watch the evidence session here on this live page with us from 2.30pm. The Archbishop of Glasgow, Philip Tartaglia, has died suddenly at his home in Glasgow. A spokeswoman for the Catholic Church said that Archbishop Tartagliahad tested positive for Covid-19 shortly after Christmasand was self-isolating at home. The cause of death is not yet clear. Archbishop Tartaglia, who was 70, was ordained a priest in 1975 and served as Archbishop of Glasgow since 2012. The spokeswoman said it would be for Pope Francis to appoint a new archbishop, but until then the Archdiocese will be overseen by an administrator. Changes to Scotland's lockdown restrictions have been announced. The tightening of the rules follows concerns the ""stay at home"" message is not having the same impact it did during last year's lockdown. The changes will come into effect on Saturday and affect:  Click here to find out all the details.  The Scottish Greens' Patrick Harvie asks the first minister about support for those who need to self-isolate. A more proactive approach is needed to help people to do the right thing, Mr Harvie adds. He points out that generally people want to comply with the rules. The first minister says eligibility criteria for support grants has been extended and that outreach services are available through local authorities. ""There is not a suggestion that people are not"" self-isolating, the FM adds. Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie says the full capacity of the gold-standard PCR tests is not being used. Why are we not using the full capacity to find as many cases as possible? Ms Sturgeon says PCR tests are used for testing everyone with symptoms. She says turnaround times are extremely good and it's important that capacity is available when it's needed for those who have symptoms. She says mass testing for those who don't have symptoms is generally most effectively carried out through a different route - using lateral flow tests - which are not as sensitive at detecting the virus. Mr Rennie says the government is great at making announcements about testing but is poor at delivering on them. We should be using the gold standard tests to hunt down the people in our community who have the virus but don't know it. Willie Rennie, Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Richard Leonard says in the past four weeks Scotland has carried out fewer tests per 100,000 than any other nation of the UK. The Scottish Labour leader quotes Mark Woolhouse, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at Edinburgh University, who says ""we are only finding half, or even less than half of the cases. This is like fighting the epidemic with one arm behind our back"". He asks when the community roll out of mass testing will happen The first minister suspects the figures Mr Leonard is using are from the demand-led testing schemes. The numbers are lower in Scotland than the rest of the UK is because the prevalence of the virus is lower here, she explains. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The Scottish government will seek to close a loophole allowing people to do non-essential things during lockdown. Nicola Sturgeon said regulations would be changed, forbidding people from leaving home for an essential purpose and then doing something considered not to be essential after they have left the house. It does mean that if the police challenge you for being out of the house doing something that is not essential, it will not be a defence to say you initially left the house to do something that was essential. Nicola Sturgeon, First Minister The Scottish Conservatives' Ruth Davidson asks if businesses that are affected by today's changes will be given extra financial support, and asks where the evidence is to back up the changes. Ms Sturgeon says an evidence paper is due to be published, but adds that because community prevalence is so high - due to the new variant - all interactions between people have to be minimised. ""There is significant money available, much of it already with businesses and much more of it flowing to businesses over the course of this month,"" the first minister insists. She adds that she will continue to look at what the Scottish government can do ""within its resources"". The first minister told MSPs in Holyrood that statutory guidance would now be introduced urging employers to support workers to remain at home ""wherever possible"". Guidance previously issued to only allow essential work in people's houses will now be placed into law, Ms Sturgeon added. We have already issued guidance to the effect that in Level 4 areas work is only permitted within a private dwelling if it is essential for the upkeep, maintenance and functioning of the household. We will now put this guidance into law, Nicola Sturgeon, First Minister The first minister says today's measures are a ""regrettable but necessary means to an end"". Ms Sturgeon points out that although these are dark and difficult times, there are also grounds for hope. She says there are early signs the lockdown is having an affect so ""we must stick with it"". The first minister says vaccination will protect many more in the weeks and months ahead. She concludes none of us are powerless in the face of this virus as we can behave in a way that reduces the risk of passing it on. ""Please stick to the spirit and not just the letter of these rules."" Interactions should be minimised and in anything we do we should assume we have the virus and follow FACTS. ""At this critical and dangerous moment please Stay Home, Protect the NHS, Save Lives."" The first minister has set out new restrictions designed to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. From Saturday, only shops selling essential items will be allowed to offer click and collect services and customers won't be able to go into takeaway food and drinks venues. Allow Twitter content?

The first minister warns pressure on the NHS is likely to increase further and continue for some time. Ms Sturgeon says last week saw the highest number of registered deaths from Covid since early May. The case numbers must be reduced to relieve pressure on the NHS and save lives, she says . That is why the cabinet is further tightening the lockdown restrictions. The first minister says: ""For now of course we are in a race against the virus. ""To win the race we must complete the vaccination programme as quickly as possible and that is what we will do. ""But we must also slow down the virus."" Ms Sturgeon says the new variant is spreading rapidly making up 60% of new cases and is making it more difficult to get the R number below one without severe restrictions. There are some signs lockdown may be having some affect, appearing to slow down and stabalise new cases. The first minister outlines Scotland's vaccination programme and highlights: Â© 2025 BBC.

"How could Scotland's Covid rules change?The Scottish government is concerned that too many people have not been following the ""stay at home"" rule.","As Scotland's hospitals fill with Covid patients and the daily-registered death toll passes 5,000, there are concerns the ""stay at home"" message has not had the same impact it did during last year's lockdown. Some of the restrictions announced by Nicola Sturgeon in early January have now been tightened even further. How do Scotland's current lockdown rules compare tothose imposed last March? Lockdown 2020 Last March outdoor exercise was allowed only if people were alone or with someone from the same household. It was initially limited to once a day, before this restriction was eased in May 2020. All exercise had to be done close to home. No mixing with other households or other any outdoor relaxation was allowed. Lockdown 2021 Now up to two people from separate households can meet for outdoor sport or exercise. Children under 12 years old do not count towards this number. There is no limit on how many times you can go out to exercise each day, but you should still stay close to home and avoid crowded areas. Prof Jason Leitch, Scotland's clinical director, says police enforcement is used as ""last resort"" against people who break the rules. These rules are not expected to change in Scotland. However, the UK government has warned that exercise restrictions may be tightened after ""large groups"" have flouted their own two-person rule. Lockdown 2020 Last March non-essential shops were ordered to shut along with cafes, bars, restaurants and cinemas. Supermarkets and pharmacies were among premises which could stay open. In July a new law made it compulsory to wear a face covering in shops across Scotland. Lockdown 2021 All pubs, restaurants and cafes must remain closed in Scotland's level four areas - although they can still serve takeaway food. The definition of ""essential retail"" has also been narrowed, forcing homeware shops and garden centres to close once again. Rules on click and collect will be tightened from 16 January. The service will be limited to retailers selling essential items and access inside premises for collection will not be allowed. Takeaway customers will also no longer be allowed inside premises for pick-up from 16 January. Businesses will have to operate from a serving hatch or doorway. Lockdown 2020 Schools and nurseries wereclosed last March, with First Minister Nicola Sturgeon saying there were too many absent staff to continue. Many teachers prepared homeworking packs and some online learning. Parents and pupils had to get used to home schooling. Children of essential workers and vulnerable pupils were looked after by staff in childcare hubs. Lockdown 2021 Schools began the January 2021 term largely via online and remote learning. As before, only children of key workers and vulnerable children are allowed in classrooms - but this time there is more focus on learning than simply child care. The number of pupils attending school is much higher than last year. Prof Leitch suggests this may be because Scotland has ""too much open"" in the rest of society with working adults in greater need of childcare. He said a ""sweet spot"" needs to be found to keep children and adults safe. The Scottish government hopes pupils can return to the classroom in February, but this plan is to be kept under review. See where coronavirus case rates have been rising in Scotland with thisinteractive map,external. Lockdown 2020 People were told to stay at home except for essential shopping for food or medicine, going out for their daily exercise, or to care for the vulnerable. Employers were asked to make provisions for staff to work from home. Wearing of face coverings on public transport was not initially required, but became mandatory in Scotland in June. Lockdown 2021 It is a legal requirementnot to leave homefor anything other than essential purposes.  A ""reasonable excuse"" can include essential shopping, exercise or caring responsibilities. People should only go out to work if it absolutely cannot be done from home.  It is illegal to travel between Scotland and other parts of the UK unless the journey is essential. There are no expectations of enhanced travel restrictions, as the rules are already ""pretty tight"" says Prof Leitch. ""We have a stay at home law, it is illegal to fly overseas, it is illegal to travel, it is illegal to leave your home without a reason to do so,"" he added. The latestcontact tracing figures,externalfrom Public Health Scotland show that since November, shops have accounted for 19% of the places visited by people the week before their positive test. While these figures don't tell us whether people contracted the virus in a specific location, they do suggest the most likely sources. The number of cases traced to shopping-related locations increased by 83% between 27 December and 3 January. Other large increases were seen when: Visiting friends (328%) Attending private events (177%) People worked in the retail sector (154%) Working in food production and warehouses (148%) Accessing personal care services (125%) In your own home (124%) Lockdown 2020 In March ""essential"" was the key word for all employers. Businesses were told they could only stay open if what they do was ""essential"" to the effort of tackling Covid or the wellbeing of society. Nicola Sturgeon saidbuilding sites should closeunless they involved work on an ""essential building"" such as a hospital. Visits from tradespeople were allowed only for ""essential repairs"". Lockdown 2021 Outdoor workplaces, construction, manufacturing, veterinary services and film and TV production can remain open. Employers have been told to plan for the minimum number of people needed on site to operate safely and effectively. Home visits by tradespeople are still allowed for essential maintenance. This guidance is being put into law from 16 January. Prof Leitch says the Scottish government continues to examine rules around what constitutes essential and non-essential construction.

NHS staff left 'traumatised' by first Covid wave,"Many hospital staff treating the sickest patients during the first wave of the pandemic were left traumatised by the experience, astudy,externalsuggests. Researchers at King's College London asked 709 workers at nine intensive care units in England about how they were coping as the first wave eased. Nearly half reported symptoms of severe anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder or problem drinking. One in seven had thoughts of self-harming or being ""better off dead"". Nursing staff were more likely to report feelings of distress than doctors or other clinical staff in the anonymous web-based survey, which was carried out in June and July last year. Just over half reported good well-being. Victoria Sullivan, an intensive care nurse at Queen's Hospital in Romford, said she often can't sleep because she's thinking about what is happening at the hospital. Her worst moment was breaking the news of a death on the phone, she said, adding that the screams from the patient's relatives ""will honestly stay with me forever"". ""Telling someone over the phone and all you can say is 'I'm really sorry', whilst they're crying their heart out, is quite traumatising,"" she said. ""Although you're saying how sorry you are, in the back of your mind, you're also thinking: 'I've got three other patients I've got to go and see, the infusions need drawing up, and meds need to be given and a nurse needs support'. ""The guilt is just too much."" This video can not be played WATCH: ICU hospital staff ""scared, sad, petrified, worried"" In the study, which has been published online but has not yet been peer-reviewed: 291 (41%) were doctors, 344 (48.5%) were nurses, and 74 (10.4%) other healthcare staff 59% reported good well-being - but despite this, 45% met the threshold for probable clinical significance for at least one of: severe depression (6%), PTSD (39%), severe anxiety (11%) or problem drinking (7%) The researchers say the findings are, in some ways, not surprising given the pressures ICU staff have faced. Their workload has been relentless, caring for more patients than is ideal and under extremely challenging circumstances. Lead researcher Prof Neil Greenberg said the findings should be a ""wake-up call"" for NHS managers. He said: ""The severity of symptoms we identified are highly likely to impair some ICU staff's ability to provide high-quality care as well as negatively impacting on their quality of life."" Prof Greenberg said it was important to have ""occupationally focused"" mental health care to try to keep staff fighting fit or, where this was not possible, to ensure they got help to access the right sort of care. And he said that, while their work suggested things may have improved over the summer, there were signs the numbers experiencing mental health problems would rise in November and December. 'How long can we keep going like this? About a week' Prof Partha Kar, diabetes consultant at Portsmouth Hospitals NHS trust, said it was ""really, really difficult seeing people battling through all sorts of odds"". He added: ""We've got sickness rates high all around us and colleagues from all specialities, where they're not accustomed to seeing such ill patients, coming out and trying to help. ""Understandably the impact of that on everybody's mental health is not insignificant either... it's such a tough place to be in."" PTSD is an anxiety disorder caused by very stressful, frightening or distressing events. Someone with PTSD often relives the traumatic event through nightmares and flashbacks, and may experience feelings of isolation, irritability and guilt. They may also have problems sleeping, such as insomnia, and find concentrating difficult. These symptoms are often severe and persistent enough to have a significant impact on the person's day-to-day life. Causes of PTSD can include: serious road accidents violent personal assaults, such as sexual assault, mugging or robbery serious health problems childbirth experiences Source:NHS,external An NHS spokesperson said: ""This is an incredibly tough time for NHS staff working on the front line which is why we have invested Â£15m in support, including 38 local mental health and well-being hubs and a service for staff with complex mental health needs, such as trauma and addiction. ""The public can also help to support doctors and nurses by following the 'hands, space, face' guidance to reduce pressure on hospitals and save lives.""

Plastic bag charge to double in Scotland from April,"The minimum cost of carrier bags in Scotland is set to double to 10p from 1 April. The Scottish government has said it is important to increase the charge periodically to encourage the use of reusable options instead. Environment Secretary Roseanna Cunningham said the move was to deter the use of single-use plastic bags. The 5p charge was introduced in 2014, with plastic bag usage dropping by 80% by the following year. Plastic or paper: Which bag is greener? Reality Check: Where does the plastic bag charge go? Could this 'biodegradable bag' cut plastic pollution? Ms Cunningham said: ""Thanks to the people of Scotland, the introduction of the charge has been successful in reducing the amount of single-use carrier bags in circulation. ""While the 5p bag charge was suitable when it was first introduced, it is important that pricing is updated to ensure that the charge continues to be a factor in making people think twice about using a single-use carrier bag."" Some retailers have pledged to donate their carrier bag charges to good causes, with Â£2.5m raised in 2019. Prior to the charge being introduced in 2014, 800 million single use carrier bags were issued annually in Scotland. By 2015 this fell by 80% with the Marine Conservation Society noting in 2016 that the number of plastic carrier bags being found on Scotland's beaches dropped by 40% two years in a row with a further drop of 42% recorded between 2018 and 2019. Keep Scotland Beautiful chief executive Barry Fisher said: ""Since 2014 the single use carrier bag charge has significantly helped reduce the number of bags being given out by retailers - saving thousands of tonnes of single use plastic realising a significant net carbon saving and reducing the chances of these items becoming littered. ""However, there is still an opportunity to challenge individual behaviours and improve consumer awareness which the doubling of the charge will help do. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the Scottish government is looking into creating an exemption on the bag charge for certain deliveries and collections, as was the case last year at the onset of the pubic health crisis.

Drill music 'increasingly used in court cases',"Drill rap videos are increasingly being used as evidence in trials Drill music has captured headlines since it started to emerge in the UK in 2012. With its often provocative lyrics, it's been blamed by police for fuelling violence. It is also increasingly being used as evidence in trials with courts hearing allegations it incites gang rivalries. But some defence lawyers and academicsÂ say it stops defendants - often young black men - getting a fair trial. The BBC has looked into the detail of dozens of prosecutions across the UK. Wood Green on 2 February 2019 was ""more reminiscent of a Hollywood film than a winter's night in north London"", the Old Bailey was told. CCTV images showed mums with buggies fleeing as masked men ran amok with long knives. One man was shot and stabbed eight times but miraculously survived. Kamali Gabbidon-Lynck, 19, was less fortunate. He was chased into a hair salon where terrified customers, staff and children watched helplessly as he was stabbed to death. Five people were charged with his murder and put on trial. Three of them were just 16. Kamali Gabbidon-Lynck died after being stabbed five times The defendants could all be placed at the scene. But not all of them took part in the actual stabbing. The prosecution had to prove they were jointly guilty of murder. This is where drill music came in. It helped to tie the defendants together and establish a motive. There was a ""beef"" between street gangs, the court heard. Most of those on trial were linked to the gang known as Northumberland Park Killers. Their victims were linked to the rival Wood Green Mob. In these ""postcode killings"", itÂ was N17 versus N22. Others had previously lost their lives in the long-running feud and the hatred was played out in drill videos uploaded to YouTube. The court heard how 'Trills' Tyrell Graham, one of the defendants, had rapped about a fatal gang shooting the previous year. We were shown the lyrics. The first line is a reference to attacking opponents. The second to the victim. The prosecution claimed there were only two possible explanations for Tyrell Graham's lyrics: ""Either they describe the life he already leads or they describe the life he aspires to lead."" Drill lyrics were presented as evidence the defendants had embracedÂ a culture of violence. The jury agreed what took place that night was an ""organised sortie into enemy territory"". They found all five guilty of murder. ""These sentences take some very dangerous young criminals off the streets of the capital,"" the Crown Prosecution Service said. But for some experts the trial raised questions. They asked is it fair for a violent musical subculture to be used as evidence of involvement in crime? Or does drill - unlike other music - encourage acts of violence? Defenders of UK drill and rap argue it's an art form that shouldn't be taken literally. It uses violent language and imagery, but as one defence lawyer puts it, the Rolling Stones sang 'I'll stick my knife right down your throat, baby' but ""it doesn't mean (Mick) Jagger was involved in gangs"". Eithne Quinn, an academic at the University of Manchester, worries about the use of drill as evidence. She has worked as a defence expert witness on almost 20 trials and says juries are often shown videos featuring young men in balaclavas and masks, rapping about stabbings and drug dealing. They will be told ""this is like a diary entry, this is like a confession"", she says. Dr Quinn says drill rap is ""a very violent form"" of expression. ""It's out to shock. The music's meant to alienate parents."" But she says the provocative posturingÂ of the rapper is part and parcel of a popular genre and shouldn't be taken at face value. ""It has no place in the courtroom,"" says Dr Quinn who set up the Prosecuting Rap research project to widen understanding of what she considers the dangers of relying on drill and rap for court testimony. She acknowledges ""there are isolated instances when drill has incited violence"" but says drill is now being used in lots of cases and although it can initially look like there's a correlation between a rap and a violent act, ""when you look at it properly it falls away, it's not credible"".Â The BBC looked at nearly 70 trials across the UK from 2005 where drill and rap was used in evidence.Â Most were in the last two years and often rappers were on trial. Many featured allegations of murder. The vast majority of the defendants were young black men and boys. We identified a total of 232 people facing trial in the 67 cases. Only eight of them were female. Almost half were teenagers. Working with academics Eithne Quinn and Abenaa Owusu-Bempah, the BBC looked at nearly 70 trials across the UK We should be ""seriously concerned about what's happening in our courtrooms"", says Abenaa Owusu-Bempah, an expert in criminal evidence at the London School of Economics. She says the high number of black defendants ""indicates a targeting of rap music because we aren't seeing it with other genres of music"". Prosecutors draw on ""stereotypical imagery about young black men and boys as criminals"" and use drillÂ ""to amplify pre-existing stereotypes"", she says. She has identified 30 cases which were appealed. Only one was successful. For prosecutors that indicates the reliability and relevance of this type of evidence. But for Assistant Professor Owusu-Bempah, ""police, prosecutors and courts do not acknowledge or appreciate the artistic value of rap music"". Rosca Onya was 17 when he was convicted of firearm offences in 2010, after being arrested in a taxi by armed police in south-east London. Officers found a loaded handgun in a footwell of the car. It was before the UK drill scene took off but prosecutors used YouTube videos of him rapping as evidence of his gang membership. Onya protested they were ""to attract the attention of a record producer"". At an appeal hearing judges had to consider if ""the video was part of art"" or ""part of the life of warring gangs in south London"". In November 2010 they ruled the videos were relevant despite being made six months before the crime as they helped the jury understand the defendant's ""disposition"". His conviction was upheld and he spent over nine years in prison where he was rehabilitated and given therapy. First being exposed to violence growing up in Democratic Republic of Congo, he says he was encouraged into street gangs by older boys soon after arriving in the UK as a nine-year-old refugee. He acknowledges the police have to protect the public and doesn't deny his involvement in crime. But he says his youthful rapping was used unfairly against him in court. ""Young kids that were growing up in an environment that was chaotic in south London that's all we knew, that's all we saw. Of course I'm gonna talk about what I'm seeing around me... the drug dealing and young people getting into trouble."" He says his raps portrayed him as ""a monster"". His lyrics were presented as evidence that ""I was gonna shoot my rival gangs and that wasn't the case"". Rap is a form of poetry in which ""you are telling a story"", he adds. Rosca Onya said Jack Merritt gave him a voice Now, aged 29 and out of prison, Onya is using rap music to rebuild his damaged life. ""Music is a go-to tool for a lot of people to cope,"" he says. This week he is recording a new track, Patience, following the success of his song in praise of Jack Merritt, the man who helped turn his life around and who was murdered in a terrorist attack in London. Onya isn't a drill rapper but he says it isn't dangerous. ""These are kids finding a voice and trying to do something better with it."" For police and the Crown Prosecution Service the instant sharing of videos on social media means they've seen violentÂ disputes escalate quickly. Recently-issued guidance from the CPS to prosecutors noted that ""gangs are increasingly using drill music and social media to promote gang culture"". They point to 'diss' videos in which rivals are taunted. In December 2018 five young people were accused of killing a 17-year-old boy in Nottingham because of a dispute inflamed by drill videos. Lyrico Steede mocked his rivals as the ""Athlete Gang' because they ran away from fights. In retaliation he was lured to a park and repeatedly stabbed. Days later one of his alleged killers, Kasharn Campbell, 19, could be seen rapping in a video allegedly referring to the stabbing. This video can not be played Two drill music videos were recorded by the rival groups He and another man were convicted of murder. Three teenagers were found guilty of manslaughter. ""It is not for me to express a view about your or anyone's taste in music,"" the judge told the defendants. ""But this is a case about stabbing, and so much of that music is about stabbing."" In June 2019 the Met Police set up Project Alpha where officers from police gang unitsÂ monitor social media sites for evidence or intelligence about crime. That means monitoring drill videos where ""gangs have openly called out each other"", says Detective Inspector Kieran McAuliffe. ""What we're looking at is opportunities where we can intervene to stop some of the violence on the streets of London."" New figures given to the BBC show that since November 2016 the Met has made 579 referrals for ""potentially harmful content"" to be removed from social media platforms - 522 were removed, mostly from YouTube. The police deny they are censoring freedom of expression. ""We are not here to suppress drill music. It's fine to use it as an outlet,"" says DI McAuliffe, but he adds: ""Just think about what you're saying."" Does drill cause crime, or offer an escape from it?

"We can make this the peak, says Matt Hancock","This video can not be played Matt Hancock: 'Together we can make this the peak' ""We can make this the peak"" of the coronavirus pandemic ""if enough people follow the rules"", Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said. He told BBC Breakfast it was ""those individual decisions"" that determine the virus's spread and it ""comes down to the behaviour of everyone"". People ""shouldn't take the mickey out of the rules,"" he said. Under the national lockdown, people in England must stay at home and only go out for limited reasons. This includes for food shopping, exercise, or work if they cannot do so from home. Similar measures are in place across much of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Latest figures show there are now more than 35,000 people in hospital with Covid - an increase on the spring peak. It comes as Prime Minister Boris Johnson is set to be questioned by MPs on the vaccine rollout later. Meanwhile, Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon is also due to announce whether there will be any changes to lockdown restrictions later. Ministershave been discussingthe possibility of tightening the current restrictions. Can I hug my vaccinated dad? And other questions What is a 'reasonable excuse' for leaving home? Postcode check: Find out the rules where you live Large trial of new Covid treatment begins in UK When asked on BBC Breakfast if this was the peak of this wave of the pandemic, Mr Hancock replied: ""I want it to be, but that comes down to the behaviour of everyone. ""Together we can make this the peak if enough people follow the rules which are incredibly clear."" Mr Hancock said England's lockdown measures were ""always under review"", but he would be ""very reluctant"" to remove the rule of meeting one other person outside for exercise as ""it is a lifeline"" for some people, including those who live alone. Mr Hancock has already ruled out scrapping support bubbles. ""What I'd rather is that everybody follow that rule and doesn't stretch it or flex it,"" he said. On the news that patients at a hospital in London are to be discharged early and sent to a hotel to help free up beds for critically ill coronavirus patients, Mr Hancock said moving patients to hotels ""isn't something we are actively putting in place"". King's College Hospital said it would help to create space for the ""high numbers"" of new admissions and would ""temporarily accommodate mainly homeless patients who are ready to safely leave hospital and will benefit from further support from community partners"". There are very early signs that infections may have peaked - although as always we should be careful about reading too much into a few days' worth of data. The past two days have seen newly diagnosed cases hover around the 46,000-mark. Up to the weekend, the average was close to 60,000. The drop has largely been driven by falls in new cases in London, the South East and East of England. The national picture does mask some regional differences. Cases are rising in the North West, which is causing particular concern. It is too early for the vaccination programme to be having any significant impact so a combination of the national lockdown on top of the tier four restrictions that were imposed in some areas before Christmas look like they may be beginning to have an impact. There is also some evidence the new variant may not be quite as fast-spreading as first feared - a Public Health England study suggested rather than being 70% more transmissible it may actually be somewhere between 30% to 50%. And, if it does represent the start of a continuous fall, it is important to remember it will still take some time to translate into fewer hospital cases - people being admitted at the moment are those who would have caught the virus a week or two ago. But after six weeks of pretty sustained rises, it is at least an encouraging sign. Asked aboutimages of elite footballers celebrating goals with hugs, Mr Hancock said: ""I think elite sport is important because these are tough times, and being able to watch the football on the telly is really important because there's loads of things that you can't do."" He said the Premier League has ""special arrangements to ensure that players are safe"" as well as a testing regime. The health secretary told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the rollout of the coronavirus vaccine will accelerate over the coming weeks, saying they were ""on track"" to deliver it to 14 million people by mid-February. Vaccines deployment minister Nadhim Zahawi later told the Commons' science and technology committee that he was ""confident"" of achieving this target. More than 2.4 million people have now had a first dose of a coronavirus vaccine, while 412,167 people have had a second dose. Mr Hancock said 40% of the 3.4m people over 80 in England had been vaccinated so far. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? YOUR QUESTIONS:We answer your queries GLOBAL SPREAD:How many worldwide cases are there? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters ""We have the capacity to get that vaccine out. The challenge is that we need to get the vaccine in,"" Mr Hancock said. ""What I know is that the supply will increase over the next few weeks and that means the very rapid rate that we are going at at the moment will continue to accelerate over the next couple of weeks."" On Tuesday, NHS Providers chief executive Chris Hopson said it was ""pretty clear"" that because of the new strain the Covid-19 infection rate was not going to go down as quickly as it did during the first wave. ""It now looks like the peak for NHS demand may actually be in February,"" he said.

He is a clear and present danger to the nation"" Edited by Jessica Murphy That's all from us today. President Donald Trump has become the first president in US history to be impeached twice. This time around, the president was charged with inciting the riot at the US Capitol last week, which left five people dead. Ten Republicans in the House of Representatives broke party ranks and voted to impeach Trump. It's a marked change from 2019's proceedings when no Republicans voted to impeach. Shortly after the vote, Trump released a video statement condemning last week's violence, but did not mention impeachment. Trump will now face trial in the Senate. This won't happen until after Democrat Joe Biden takes office next week on 20 January. Looking for more? Read more about today's vote here.

In an interview with the BBC, former FBI Director James Comey warns of ""armed, disturbed, violent people"" who are planning to act in the coming days.

The police chief of Houston, Texas, has announced that an 18-year veteran of the city's police force was among those that illegally ""penetrated"" the Capitol during last week's riot. Chief Art Acevedo said the officer had been relieved of his duties and notified that he will face a disciplinary hearing. Acevedo said there was a ""high probability"" the officer will face federal charges. ""I canât tell you the anger I feel at the thought of a police officer and other police officers thinking they get to go storm the Capitol,"" he told a news conference. Meanwhile, the Department of Justice (DOJ) announced more arrests. Seven people accused of playing a role in the Capitol riot have been charged with rioting, looting and trespassing among other charges. According to the DOJ, the arrests took place from Idaho to Wisconsin to Florida. A number of celebrities who are vocal critics of Trump have taken to social media

""I have directed federal agencies to use all necessary resources to maintain order in Washington DC,"" Trump says. ""We are bringing in thousands of National Guard members to secure the city and ensure that a transition can occur safely and without incident."" ""Like all of you I was shocked and deeply saddened by the calamity at the Capitol last week. I want to thank the hundreds of millions of incredible American citizens who have responded to this moment with calm moderation."" During his remarks, Trump criticised what he described as an ""assault on free speech"". In recent days, the president's personal accounts have been removed from Twitter, YouTube and Facebook. ""These are tense and difficult times. The efforts to censor, cancel and blacklist our fellow citizens are wrong. ""And they are dangerous. What is needed now is for us to listen to one another. Not to silence one another."" Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi has just signed the article of impeachment against President Trump. Now it's official. She's appeared with the House leaders and impeachment managers - these are the lawmakers who were tasked with presenting the case to the Senate as prosecutors. Senators will then act as jurors during the trial and ultimately decide whether or not to convict the president on the charge. The lead manager is Jamie Raskin. He's joined by Diana DeGette, David Cicilline, Joaquin Castro, Eric Swalwell, Madeleine Dean and Joe Neguse. ""Today the House demonstrated that no one is above the law, not even the president of the United States,"" Pelosi said before signing. ""That Donald Trump is a clear and present danger to the country and that once again we honour that oath of office to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States. ""And now, I sadly and with a heart broken over what this means to our country, of a president who would incite insurrection, will sign the engrossment of the article of impeachment."" President Trump ends with a call for unity. ""All of us can choose by our actions to rise above the rancour and find common ground and shared purpose. We must focus on advancing the interests of the whole nation, delivering the miracle vaccines, defeating the pandemic, rebuilding the economy, protecting our national security and upholding the rule of law,"" he says. ""Today I am calling on all Americans to overcome the passions of the moment, and join together as one American people,"" he says. ""God bless you, and God bless America."" The violence, Trump says, must stop. ""Whether you are on the right, or on the left, a Democrat or a Republican, there is never a justification for violence. No excuses. No exceptions. America is a nation of laws. Those who engaged in the attacks last week will be brought to justice."" Trump refers to the additional protests planned across the US in the coming days, saying he has been briefed by authorities on potential threats. ""Every American deserves to have their voice heard in a respectful and peaceful way. That is your First Amendment right. But I cannot emphasise that there must be no violence, no law breaking, and no vandalism of any kind [sic]. Everyone must follow our laws and obey the instructions of law enforcement."" In a sombre tone addressing his ""fellow Americans"", President Trump says he ""unequivocally"" condemns the violence in America's capital yesterday. ""No true supporter of mine could ever endorse political violence. No true supporter of mine could ever disrespect law enforcement or our great American flag,"" he said. ""If you do any of these things you are not supporting our movement you are attacking it and you are attacking our country. We cannot tolerate it."" It is Trump's strongest statement to date after a mob of his supporters broke into the US Capitol building. Five people died as a result. In a video message posted to the White House's Twitter account, Donald Trump has just condemned the violence in the Capitol last week, saying ""violence and vandalism have absolutely no place in our country and no place in our movement"". He did not make any reference to impeachment. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

President Trump has just become the first sitting president to be impeached twice by the US House of Representatives. Arecent CBS poll,externalshowed a small majority of Americans favoured impeaching Trump. We asked members of our BBC voter panel to weigh in as well. Here's what they said: Everything he has done is unconstitutional and, as a president, the number one thing he should be doing is upholding the Constitution. If not for him continually fighting the election results and claiming the election was stolen, if not for him holding that rally near the Capitol, if not for him talking about 'uprising', last week would very likely not have happened. Unfortunately it was completely predictable. Melissa Dangaran, 51, from Minnesota Unprecedented. He should not have been impeached at all. There is no justification, no legal basis, no constitutional basis for it. It's a rush to judgment for ulterior motives and a dark stain on our country. I'm concerned about the double standard and I'm afraid our Constitution is on its deathbed. Why would anybody who's rational think that our president meant for people to go break into the Capitol? Belinda Noah, 45, from Florida It's more of a symbolic impeachment at this point because he'll be out soon, but it's necessary nonetheless. Not only is he a threat to our national security, but he doesn't condone white supremacy and other threats. It's deeply saddening to me. Williams Morales, 19, from Georgia I was in DC at the rally - not near the Capitol - but I saw the president speak with my own eyes and he did not call for anyone to storm the building or cause harm. It's just a way to ensure he will not run in the next four years. It is political and it will create a bigger divide between left and right. All violence should be condemned fairly and justly. It was a very sad outcome, but I do not believe it was the most horrible day in our country's history. Gabriel Montalvo, 21, from New York Republican pollster Frank Luntz says the most ""amazing statistic"" to him is the fact that half of Trump's voters want him to keep fighting over election 2020. ""They want him to continue to fight right up to the inauguration,"" he told the BBC. He says this passion, even in the face of evidence, explains what happened during the riot last week. Luntz also warns that ""there's a danger that the Republican party actually splits in half"" post-Trump - and as things stands, at the moment, ""there are more people who'd go with Trump"". ""The level of passion among Trump voters has not dissipated,"" he notes. ""They are as loud and as passionate and I believe a whole lot of them are coming to Washington next week for the inauguration and they're not coming to cheer on Joe Biden."" Watch the full clip below.

Trump has made history with his second impeachment. Here's how the moment is being covered, worldwide. Donald Trump is expected to speak tonight, likely sometime in the next 45 minutes. The White House is reportedly still working out where to post the video message, which will come on the heels of his second impeachment. The president's personal accounts have been barred from Twitter, YouTube and Facebook following last week's riots. President Clinton addresses the nation after being impeached by the US House of Representatives When he was first impeached in 2019, President Donald Trump became part of a small group of rebuked US leaders. After today, President Trump is the first president to be impeached twice. Only two other presidents in history have been impeached by the House of Representatives - Andrew Johnson, back in 1868, and Bill Clinton in 1998. Another - Richard Nixon - stepped down and resigned. But to date, no president has ever been removed from the White House by Congress. So what happened to their popularity and the fortunes of their party?Read more here. Â© 2025 BBC.

Leila NathooBBC political correspondent Sir Keir Starmer tried to pin the blame for meagre food parcels sent to some school children studying at home, on the government rather than individual suppliers. He claimed there wasnât actually much difference between the packages that the PM described as âdisgracefulâ and âan insult to familiesâ and an example of a package set out in official guidance. Downing St sources say he was âselectively quotingâ from that guidance and that the images highlighted on social media donât come close to whatâs recommended. But it's clear the issue of free school meals is a sensitive one for the government, and one that provides a bruise for Labour to press. Allow Twitter content?

Reality Check At Prime Ministerâs Questions, Boris Johnson said that âthe lockdown measures we had in place, combined with tier four measures, are starting to show some signs of effect.â Looking at cases of Covid-19 in England, the average for the week ending 1 January was almost 55,000 cases. The week ending 6 January shows a slight dip, to 52,400. These people will have been infected before Englandâs lockdown came in on January 6, although much of the country was under very strict measures before then. So, using publicly available data, it might be too early to make this assessment. And in the past month, weâve seen that a couple of days of decline can quickly be followed by a sustained increase in cases. But what is clear is that hospital admissions from coronavirus appear to be increasing (they usually peak up to a couple of weeks after high numbers of cases). The latest seven day average (ending on January 7) saw 3,705 people admitted to hospital daily in England â thatâs the highest throughout the entire pandemic.  BBC Politics Here's a recap on the main talking points from PMQs: Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle has brought PMQs to a close. Standby for a quick recap.... Labour's Andrew Slaughter says he has received an email from a teacher who says that ""lack of government guidance means her staff will soon be over 100 children - ten times as many as in the first lockdown"". He says ""lockdown in name only may suit the PM"" and accuses Mr Johnson of ""bending the rules himself"". Boris Johnson thanks all schools throughout the country and says that everyone ""wants to see the children of key workers and vulnerable children getting the education they need"". Conservative Andrea Leadsom says the lockdown has been ""awful"" for new parents and seeks reassurance from the PM that the recommendations of her review into early years will form ""a core part"" of his ambition to ""build back better"". Boris Johnson praises her passion for the issue and says he looks forward to working with her ""to achieve the change we want"". Ben Everitt MP In response to a question from Tory Ben Everitt about knife crime in his community, the PM says the government is acting across the board, through introducing knife crime protection orders, getting 6,000 more police officers on the beat and deterring criminals through ""continuous and serious law enforcement"". He adds that those caught with a knife in their possession should get the sentences they deserve. SNP MP Gavin Newlands says British Gas and British Airways' practices of firing and rehiring staff to force new terms and conditions is ""shameful"". He says he has a bill with cross-party support which would outlaw the practice, he asks for a meeting with the PM to discuss it. Mr Johnson says ""there are laws in place to ensure that contractual conditions"" cannot discriminate, but the government is meeting with the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (ACAS) to see what else can be done. Labour's Karl Turner says the government should make use of pharmacies who ""stand willing and able to deliver desperately-needed vaccines"". He accuses the government of ""shunning"" the ""fully-trained technicians"" who work in pharmacies. Boris Johnson says pharmacies do an amazing job but adds that ""we want to ensure we get doses to the places where they are going to get distributed most effectively. ""We need to avoid any wastage at all - that is why we are concentrating on the hospitals and mass vaccination sites."" Labour's Kevin Brennan asks about visas for British musicians to perform in the EU and vice versa, saying it is disappointing that a reciprocal deal has yet to be agreed. He says the issue is fixable but needs leadership from the top. He urges a cross-party approach to sort this out as soon as possible, given the damage he says it will do to the UK's reputation as one of the leading cultural centres in Europe. The PM agrees, saying he expects the EU will want to do more to facilitate easy travel for musicians and other professionals across a range of sectors, saying there is a ""mutual benefit"".  The Lib Dem's deputy leader Daisy Cooper says the vaccination drive in her local area is being hampered because the supply is inconsistent and often arrives at short notice. She asks the PM to ""personally intervene"" to ensure all centres have ""a greater and more consistent"" supply. Boris Johnson says the constraint is not the distribution network but the supply. He says the UK has a bigger supply than most other European countries. DUP MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson says his constituency has ""empty supermarket shelves"" and people cannot get materials or ship things over from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. He asks if the Northern Ireland Protocol can be invoked to help provide direct government intervention to help resolve Northern Ireland shipping problems. Mr Johnson says ""there are teething problems"" but there are no issues holding up goods. He says if the situation worsens then there will be no hesitation in invoking the Protocol to help Northern Ireland. The Northern Ireland Protocol was a key part of the withdrawal agreement the UK and EU agreed in 2019 as part of the UK's divorce from the bloc. You canread a bit more background on the NI Protocol here. We're now on to questions from backbenchers. Tory Julian Sturdy says progress on the vaccination rollout is very encouraging and seeks assurances that it is the PM's ""over-riding priority"" to lift the current nationwide restrictions at the earliest opportunity when current targets are met and ""immunity widens"". The PM promises a ""phased relaxation of controls"" when all the top four categories of most vulnerable groups - that's about 15 million people - have been innoculated. But he says this must be consistent with protecting the NHS and ensuring it is not overwhelmed. Leila NathooBBC political correspondent Pressed earlier by the Labour leader on why current restrictions in England are looser now than they were in March, Boris Johnson said the measures were starting to show signs of some effect and pointed to the damaging effects of lockdown. The PM seems determined to stick to the current framework for now â while still stressing that people must follow the rules.  Mr Blackford says the PM's reply was ""an insult"" to fishermen. He says Scottish seafood exporters are losing ""upwards of Â£1m in sales a day"". He asks the PM if the government will provide compensation to the fishing industry. Boris Johnson says the SNP's policy of an independent Scotland would be ""destructive to the Scottish economy"". He says the party should be focused on fighting the pandemic. The SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford says his constituent is experiencing his ""worst nightmare"". He says his constituent lost Â£40,000 of produce after a lorry-load of seafood was held up by ""Brexit red tape"". ""Where is the sea of opportunity that he and his Scottish Tories promised,"" Mr Blackford asks. Boris Johnson replies that his government is investing Â£100m into the fishing industry. He says the SNP wants to break up the UK under ""a hare brain scheme"" and accuses the party of wanting to ""hand back control of fisheries to Brussels"". Â© 2025 BBC.

There's been a lot of coronavirus news around today - here are some of the main headlines: Jordan has launched a Covid-19 vaccination programme intended
to protect more than 20% of the kingdomâs 10 million population. The government has said the first stage will focus on people
over the age of 60, those with chronic illnesses, and medical personnel. It aims
to administer 5,000 shots a day at 29 centres. Health Minister Nazir Obeidattold the state news agency Petra,externalthat the first day had gone âsmoothlyâ. But the head of the ministryâs epidemics and communicable
diseases department, Wael Hayajneh,urged more people to register for the free vaccines,external, with
only 200,000 reportedly signed up since late December. The government has purchased vaccines produced by Pfizer-BioNTech
and China's Sinopharm. The latter was granted an âemergency licenceâ on Saturday. Jordan has seen a sharp fall in the daily number of new
infections since mid-November, when restrictions that
had been eased during the summer were reintroduced. More than 309,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19
and 4,076 deaths have been reported since the start of the pandemic. There's been focus this week on whether people are adhering to the rules around wearing face coverings in shops. Tesco, Asda and Waitrose have becomethe latest supermarkets to say they will deny entry to shoppers who do not wear face masks,  unless they are medically exempt. It follows a similar move by Morrisons, while Sainsbury's says it will challenge those who flout the rules. So what protection do masks offer, what sort can be worn, and what are the rules across the UK? Read our explainer here The education select committee chairman has asked the PM for the roadmap for reopening schools in England. Robert Halfon asked the prime minister about the mental health and social isolation effects on children being away from schools. Boris Johnson says the lockdown measures âhave got to continue to workâ, after showing âsome early signs of progressâ. But he says it was âfar, far too earlyâ to say that would lead to a relaxation next month. This video can not be played Covid-19: Johnson and Halfon on lockdown effect on children Gavin StampBBC political reporter The UK governmentâs Covid O
committee is expected to discuss the new variant of coronavirus that has
emerged in Brazil tomorrow. The prime minister hinted to MPs that there could be restrictions on travel from Brazil to the UK - but a final decision has not been taken. Speaking to MPs he said: ""We are taking steps to ensure that we do not see
the import of this new variant from Brazil."" The Catholic Archbishop of Glasgow has died after contracting Covid-19 shortly after Christmas. Philip Tartaglia, 70, was one of the most senior figures in the Catholic Church in Scotland. The Church said his cause of death was not yet clear. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she felt ""deep sadness"" to hear of Archbishop Tartaglia's death. She told Scottish Parliament: ""I'm sure that is sadness shared by everybody across this chamber - and to send my deepest condolences to his loved ones and of course everybody in his community."" Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf said he had ""many fond memories"" of conversations he had shared with the archbishop. Philip Tartaglia was born in Glasgow in 1951 and was appointed Archbishop of Glasgow in 2012. He died on 13 January, which is the Feast of St Mungo - the patron saint of Glasgow. More than 9.3 million of Americans have received the first shot of a Covid vaccine The US has been by far the world's worst-hit nation in the pandemic, with Johns Hopkins University reporting late on Tuesday a record 4,470 Covid-related deaths in the past 24 hours. Here are the latest key developments in America on Wednesday:  The US has had more than 22 million confirmed infections since the start of the outbreak, according to Johns Hopkins. The overall Covid-related death toll has now exceeded 380,000, and is closing in fast on the number of American soldiers killed in World War Two, at about 407,000. Doctors' leaders have called for urgent improvements in personal protective equipment for health workers. The British Medical Association isappealing for a higher grade of face maskto guard against coronavirus infection. It says there is 'growing evidence' that the virus is being spread through the air by aerosols. These are tiny virus particles that can build up in stuffy rooms and they have been linked to outbreaks of Covid-19. This follows an open letter from more than 1,500 health professionals for staff on general wards to be given the type of high-quality masks usually only worn in intensive care units. Public Health England (PHE) has issued guidance on what PPE staff in different settings require. It was last updatedin October 2020,external. And you canread our explainer hereon face masks, including what protection they offer, what sort can be worn, and what the rules are across the UK. A highly contagious strain of coronavirus first detected in South Africa has spread to 20 countries, the WHO says The World Health Organisation (WHO) has expressed concern about the spread of new coronavirus variants. A highly infectious strain, which originated in the UK, has now spread to 50 countries and territories, the WHO said. Since the strain was first detected late last year, it has driven a spike in coronavirus infections and deaths linked to the disease in the UK. A strain first identified in South Africa, meanwhile, has spread to 20 other countries, the WHO said. Health experts say both new variants appear to be more transmissible than previous strains but not necessarily any more dangerous. They have also played down the possibility that vaccines will not be as effective against these variants. Still, the increased transmission of these variants is taking its toll. ""Going into a second year of this [pandemic] could even be tougher given some of the transmission dynamics,"" WHO expert Mike Ryan said during an event on social media. There are also concerns about a third new strain the Japanese authorities have identified in four people who are thought to have caught it in Brazil. BBC Radio 5 Live The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has been a major plank of the government's support during the pandemic. Under the furlough scheme, the government pays up to 80% of employees' wages up to Â£2,500. But it has been found to be open to abuse. New figures from HMRC given to BBC Radio 5 Live's Wake Up to Money programme show the department ishandling more than 21,000 reportsof suspected fraudulent use of the furlough scheme, 5,000 of which are under formal investigation. The money is either due to fraudulent claims, or is being paid out in error. The number of tip offs has spiralled sincelast April, from 3,000 to 21,378 reports of suspect payments by early January. HMRC told the BBC: ""This is taxpayers' money and fraudulent claims limit our ability to support people and deprive public services of essential funding."" The DUPâs Ian Paisley has failed to trigger an emergency Commons debate on the discarding of donated kidneys during the coronavirus pandemic. The MP for North Antrim said he had heard some viable organs had been discarded, and called for transplant operations to continue, perhaps using private facilities. Deputy Speaker Eleanor Laing later told him it would be not be allowed, but said a health minister was present and listening to his request. This video can not be played Covid-19: DUP MP says donated kidney discarded in pandemic Lisa SummersBBC Scotland Health Correspondent We heard earlier from Nicola Sturgeon thatrestrictions in Scotland will tightenfrom Saturday. The Scottish government is acting now because of the strain on the health service. Its experts are warning the NHS could beoverwhelmed even under a 'stay at home' scenario,external. We've already seen two health boards postponing all non-urgent surgical procedures as an increase in Covid cases puts growing pressure on the system. The action from NHS Lanarkshire and NHS Ayrshire and Arran is showing how the numbers of Covid patients in hospital is really starting to impact on wider care. Wards that would usually treat people recovering from hip or knee replacements for example may need to be converted into Covid wards. Theatres, usually busy carrying out multiple routine surgeries will become high dependency or intensive care facilities. When staff need to be redeployed to work with Covid patients, it is not safe to carry out other routine work. These are the difficult choices many health boards will face over the coming weeks. Action required now to deal with this health emergency will have consequences later. Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva The event at Wengen is one of the most prestigious at the Ski World Cup Switzerlandâs iconic Lauberhorn ski race has been cancelled because of rising cases of Covid-19, many of them, Swiss health officials say, spread by one British tourist. The resort of Wengen, where the famous race is held, had recorded no cases of the virus until October, and only ten until mid-December. After that, cases began to shoot up, and, worryingly, sequencing revealed many of them were the new highly infectious variant first detected in the UK. Contact tracers found that 27 of the cases alone could be linked to one British tourist who recently stayed in a Wengen hotel. Wengen desperately tried to save the race, offering to close off the resort to everyone but competitors, and even closing its schools. At first Swiss health officials agreed, but when, at the start of this week yet more Covid-19 cases were recorded, they pulled the emergency brake. Wengen is devastated. The Lauberhorn is not just any race, but one of the top competitions on the Ski World Cup circuit. It is dearly loved by the Swiss, who have watched with delight as some of their own home-grown talent - such as Beat Feuz and Carlo Janka - triumphed there. Rachel SchraerBBC Health Reporter As MPs have been mentioning today - a coronavirus variant has been found circulating in the Amazonas state of Brazil, and was picked up in Japan in travellers from the region. Itâs different from the UK and South African variants, but it contains common mutations - two changes to the virusâ ""spike"" in particular which have been flagged as potentially making the virus more infectious. This is not going to be the last mutation we hear about. At the moment changes are mainly being picked up in areas that do lots of genetic tracking of the virus - itâs almost certain there are other mutations already circulating unseen in other parts of the world. And the virus will continue to mutate - itâs just a question of how, how much and how fast. For now thereâs no evidence the virus is becoming more dangerous - but if more people catch it then, left unchecked, more will potentially become ill or die. But the vaccines, which target several different areas of the virusâ spike, should still work - though thatâs something that scientists the world over will be monitoring very closely. There have now been more deaths in the second wave of the pandemic than the first, Public Health England's medical director has said. Dr Yvonne Doyle was reacting to the new record of 1,564 deaths within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus in the UK that have been announced this hour. She said: âWith each passing day, more and more people are tragically losing their lives to this terrible virus, and today we have reported the highest number of deaths on a single day since the pandemic began. ""There have now been more deaths in the second wave than the first. âAbout one-in-three people with Covid-19 donât show symptoms, but can still pass it on to others so it is essential that we stay at home, minimise contact with other people and act as if you have the virus.â Labour's chair of the Home Affairs Committee Yvette Cooper, points out loopholes for travellers arriving home from abroad - including travelling on UK public transport when coming back from a holiday destination. Mr Johnson says there is a ""balanced approach"" from the government on the health of the nation vs the health of the economy. Ms Cooper says other countries brought in negative Covid tests as a requirement to travel ""months ago"" whereas the UK is only bringing these in from Friday. Mr Johnson says 3.5m passengers have been spot-checked since June 2020. He says a ""great deal of work"" goes into checking ""passenger data forms"" to check where people have come from. Ms Cooper says over 90% of those passenger data forms are not being checked. She says these checks ""might as well be voluntary"". Mr Johnson replies that those arriving from abroad are being screened. Ms Cooper asks why people from Brazil are not being checked for Covid, considering that there is a new strain in the South American country which could undermine the UK's vaccination programme. ""We are taking steps to ensure"" that the UK doesn't see the new variant in Brazil coming to the UK, replies Mr Johnson. Caroline Nokes, who chairs Parliament's Women and Equalities Commitee, then asks the PM about access to healthcare during the pandemic. She says the evidence shows it is women who are finding accessing services difficult, referring to a constituent who said her surgery was not currently doing smear tests. Nokes asks the PM what is an acceptable wait for a smear test? The PM says he sympathises with anybody who has had their treatment delayed. ""Sadly, that's what we are seeing. We're seeing delays in cancer, we're seeing delays in smear tests and vital services that people need, and that's a result in the increase in the numbers of Covid patients and that's why we have to work flat out to get the virus under control and reduce the current wave and give people the service we need."" Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Perhaps the most distressing element about the latest Covid deaths is that the numbers are almost certainly going to rise from here. People who are dying now are likely to have been infected around three weeks ago. That was at a point when infection rates were rising quite steeply, so in the coming days and weeks we should, sadly, expect to see more deaths than this. Todayâs figures are affected by the weekend, which sees delays reporting deaths that tend to translate into higher figures from Tuesday onwards. Currently around 800 to 900 people a day on average are dying once you take this into account. But the figures also provide some hope. For the third day, in a row the number of newly diagnosed infections are well below 50,000. There had been several days where they have exceeded 60,000. If that trend continues, and the number of new cases keeps coming down, that will eventually translate into the number of deaths falling. But it is going to take some weeks for that to happen. These are, as many have been saying, the darkest days of the pandemic so far. Caroline Nokes, who chairs Parliament's Women and Equalities Committee, asks the PM what additional protections are being put in place to help victims of domestic abuse who have insecure immigration status. The PM says the government has done ""what we can"" since the start of the pandemic to encourage victims of domestic abuse to come forward, including setting up helplines and investing in independent domestic abuse advisers. He says lockdown rules don't apply to victims of domestic abuse. Nokes follows up by asking why a better job is not being done of explaining lockdown rules to vulnerable people - for example, those who rely on British Sign Language or who might have learning difficulties. The PM says he has been asked a couple of times about sign language in particular, and he is going to ""take that away and see what we can do to increase sign language"". He adds that campaigns the government have produced are available in accessible formats and translations. Â© 2025 BBC.

Itâs different from the UK and South African variants, but it contains common mutations - two changes to the virusâ ""spike"" in particular which have been flagged as potentially making the virus more infectious. This is not going to be the last mutation we hear about. At the moment changes are mainly being picked up in areas that do lots of genetic tracking of the virus - itâs almost certain there are other mutations already circulating unseen in other parts of the world. And the virus will continue to mutate - itâs just a question of how, how much and how fast. For now thereâs no evidence the virus is becoming more dangerous - but if more people catch it then, left unchecked, more will potentially become ill or die. But the vaccines, which target several different areas of the virusâ spike, should still work - though thatâs something that scientists the world over will be monitoring very closely. There have now been more deaths in the second wave of the pandemic than the first, Public Health England's medical director has said. Dr Yvonne Doyle was reacting to the new record of 1,564 deaths within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus in the UK that have been announced this hour. She said: âWith each passing day, more and more people are tragically losing their lives to this terrible virus, and today we have reported the highest number of deaths on a single day since the pandemic began. ""There have now been more deaths in the second wave than the first. âAbout one-in-three people with Covid-19 donât show symptoms, but can still pass it on to others so it is essential that we stay at home, minimise contact with other people and act as if you have the virus.â Labour's chair of the Home Affairs Committee Yvette Cooper, points out loopholes for travellers arriving home from abroad - including travelling on UK public transport when coming back from a holiday destination. Mr Johnson says there is a ""balanced approach"" from the government on the health of the nation vs the health of the economy. Ms Cooper says other countries brought in negative Covid tests as a requirement to travel ""months ago"" whereas the UK is only bringing these in from Friday. Mr Johnson says 3.5m passengers have been spot-checked since June 2020. He says a ""great deal of work"" goes into checking ""passenger data forms"" to check where people have come from. Ms Cooper says over 90% of those passenger data forms are not being checked. She says these checks ""might as well be voluntary"". Mr Johnson replies that those arriving from abroad are being screened. Ms Cooper asks why people from Brazil are not being checked for Covid, considering that there is a new strain in the South American country which could undermine the UK's vaccination programme. ""We are taking steps to ensure"" that the UK doesn't see the new variant in Brazil coming to the UK, replies Mr Johnson. Caroline Nokes, who chairs Parliament's Women and Equalities Commitee, then asks the PM about access to healthcare during the pandemic. She says the evidence shows it is women who are finding accessing services difficult, referring to a constituent who said her surgery was not currently doing smear tests. Nokes asks the PM what is an acceptable wait for a smear test? The PM says he sympathises with anybody who has had their treatment delayed. ""Sadly, that's what we are seeing. We're seeing delays in cancer, we're seeing delays in smear tests and vital services that people need, and that's a result in the increase in the numbers of Covid patients and that's why we have to work flat out to get the virus under control and reduce the current wave and give people the service we need."" Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Perhaps the most distressing element about the latest Covid deaths is that the numbers are almost certainly going to rise from here. People who are dying now are likely to have been infected around three weeks ago. That was at a point when infection rates were rising quite steeply, so in the coming days and weeks we should, sadly, expect to see more deaths than this. Todayâs figures are affected by the weekend, which sees delays reporting deaths that tend to translate into higher figures from Tuesday onwards. Currently around 800 to 900 people a day on average are dying once you take this into account. But the figures also provide some hope. For the third day, in a row the number of newly diagnosed infections are well below 50,000. There had been several days where they have exceeded 60,000. If that trend continues, and the number of new cases keeps coming down, that will eventually translate into the number of deaths falling. But it is going to take some weeks for that to happen. These are, as many have been saying, the darkest days of the pandemic so far. Caroline Nokes, who chairs Parliament's Women and Equalities Committee, asks the PM what additional protections are being put in place to help victims of domestic abuse who have insecure immigration status. The PM says the government has done ""what we can"" since the start of the pandemic to encourage victims of domestic abuse to come forward, including setting up helplines and investing in independent domestic abuse advisers. He says lockdown rules don't apply to victims of domestic abuse. Nokes follows up by asking why a better job is not being done of explaining lockdown rules to vulnerable people - for example, those who rely on British Sign Language or who might have learning difficulties. The PM says he has been asked a couple of times about sign language in particular, and he is going to ""take that away and see what we can do to increase sign language"". He adds that campaigns the government have produced are available in accessible formats and translations. Â© 2025 BBC.

He is a clear and present danger to the nation"" Edited by Jessica Murphy That's all from us today. President Donald Trump has become the first president in US history to be impeached twice. This time around, the president was charged with inciting the riot at the US Capitol last week, which left five people dead. Ten Republicans in the House of Representatives broke party ranks and voted to impeach Trump. It's a marked change from 2019's proceedings when no Republicans voted to impeach. Shortly after the vote, Trump released a video statement condemning last week's violence, but did not mention impeachment. Trump will now face trial in the Senate. This won't happen until after Democrat Joe Biden takes office next week on 20 January. Looking for more? Read more about today's vote here.

""These are tense and difficult times. The efforts to censor, cancel and blacklist our fellow citizens are wrong. ""And they are dangerous. What is needed now is for us to listen to one another. Not to silence one another."" Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi has just signed the article of impeachment against President Trump. Now it's official. She's appeared with the House leaders and impeachment managers - these are the lawmakers who were tasked with presenting the case to the Senate as prosecutors. Senators will then act as jurors during the trial and ultimately decide whether or not to convict the president on the charge. The lead manager is Jamie Raskin. He's joined by Diana DeGette, David Cicilline, Joaquin Castro, Eric Swalwell, Madeleine Dean and Joe Neguse. ""Today the House demonstrated that no one is above the law, not even the president of the United States,"" Pelosi said before signing.

""If you do any of these things you are not supporting our movement you are attacking it and you are attacking our country. We cannot tolerate it."" It is Trump's strongest statement to date after a mob of his supporters broke into the US Capitol building. Five people died as a result.

President Trump has just become the first sitting president to be impeached twice by the US House of Representatives. Arecent CBS poll,externalshowed a small majority of Americans favoured impeaching Trump. We asked members of our BBC voter panel to weigh in as well. Here's what they said: Everything he has done is unconstitutional and, as a president, the number one thing he should be doing is upholding the Constitution. If not for him continually fighting the election results and claiming the election was stolen, if not for him holding that rally near the Capitol, if not for him talking about 'uprising', last week would very likely not have happened. Unfortunately it was completely predictable. Melissa Dangaran, 51, from Minnesota Unprecedented. He should not have been impeached at all. There is no justification, no legal basis, no constitutional basis for it. It's a rush to judgment for ulterior motives and a dark stain on our country. I'm concerned about the double standard and I'm afraid our Constitution is on its deathbed. Why would anybody who's rational think that our president meant for people to go break into the Capitol? Belinda Noah, 45, from Florida It's more of a symbolic impeachment at this point because he'll be out soon, but it's necessary nonetheless. Not only is he a threat to our national security, but he doesn't condone white supremacy and other threats. It's deeply saddening to me. Williams Morales, 19, from Georgia I was in DC at the rally - not near the Capitol - but I saw the president speak with my own eyes and he did not call for anyone to storm the building or cause harm. It's just a way to ensure he will not run in the next four years. It is political and it will create a bigger divide between left and right. All violence should be condemned fairly and justly. It was a very sad outcome, but I do not believe it was the most horrible day in our country's history. Gabriel Montalvo, 21, from New York Republican pollster Frank Luntz says the most ""amazing statistic"" to him is the fact that half of Trump's voters want him to keep fighting over election 2020. ""They want him to continue to fight right up to the inauguration,"" he told the BBC. He says this passion, even in the face of evidence, explains what happened during the riot last week. Luntz also warns that ""there's a danger that the Republican party actually splits in half"" post-Trump - and as things stands, at the moment, ""there are more people who'd go with Trump"". ""The level of passion among Trump voters has not dissipated,"" he notes. ""They are as loud and as passionate and I believe a whole lot of them are coming to Washington next week for the inauguration and they're not coming to cheer on Joe Biden."" Watch the full clip below. This video can not be played Trump impeachment: 'Three quarters of Trump voters believe he won' As reactions pour in from across the US, here's a look at what some of the 10 Republicans who voted to impeach Trump have to say.

Trump has made history with his second impeachment. Here's how the moment is being covered, worldwide. Donald Trump is expected to speak tonight, likely sometime in the next 45 minutes. The White House is reportedly still working out where to post the video message, which will come on the heels of his second impeachment. The president's personal accounts have been barred from Twitter, YouTube and Facebook following last week's riots. President Clinton addresses the nation after being impeached by the US House of Representatives When he was first impeached in 2019, President Donald Trump became part of a small group of rebuked US leaders. After today, President Trump is the first president to be impeached twice. Only two other presidents in history have been impeached by the House of Representatives - Andrew Johnson, back in 1868, and Bill Clinton in 1998. Another - Richard Nixon - stepped down and resigned. But to date, no president has ever been removed from the White House by Congress. So what happened to their popularity and the fortunes of their party?Read more here. Â© 2025 BBC.

Williams Morales, 19, from Georgia I was in DC at the rally - not near the Capitol - but I saw the president speak with my own eyes and he did not call for anyone to storm the building or cause harm. It's just a way to ensure he will not run in the next four years. It is political and it will create a bigger divide between left and right. All violence should be condemned fairly and justly. It was a very sad outcome, but I do not believe it was the most horrible day in our country's history. Gabriel Montalvo, 21, from New York Republican pollster Frank Luntz says the most ""amazing statistic"" to him is the fact that half of Trump's voters want him to keep fighting over election 2020. ""They want him to continue to fight right up to the inauguration,"" he told the BBC. He says this passion, even in the face of evidence, explains what happened during the riot last week. Luntz also warns that ""there's a danger that the Republican party actually splits in half"" post-Trump - and as things stands, at the moment, ""there are more people who'd go with Trump"". ""The level of passion among Trump voters has not dissipated,"" he notes. ""They are as loud and as passionate and I believe a whole lot of them are coming to Washington next week for the inauguration and they're not coming to cheer on Joe Biden.""

Trump has made history with his second impeachment. Here's how the moment is being covered, worldwide. Donald Trump is expected to speak tonight, likely sometime in the next 45 minutes. The White House is reportedly still working out where to post the video message, which will come on the heels of his second impeachment. The president's personal accounts have been barred from Twitter, YouTube and Facebook following last week's riots. President Clinton addresses the nation after being impeached by the US House of Representatives When he was first impeached in 2019, President Donald Trump became part of a small group of rebuked US leaders. After today, President Trump is the first president to be impeached twice. Only two other presidents in history have been impeached by the House of Representatives - Andrew Johnson, back in 1868, and Bill Clinton in 1998. Another - Richard Nixon - stepped down and resigned. But to date, no president has ever been removed from the White House by Congress. So what happened to their popularity and the fortunes of their party?Read more here. Â© 2025 BBC.

"US executes only woman on federal death rowLisa Montgomery, who killed a pregnant woman and took her baby, died by lethal injection in Indiana.","Lisa Montgomery was sentenced to death in 2007 Lisa Montgomery - the only female inmate on federal death row in the US - has been executed for murder. She received a lethal injection at a prison in Terre Haute, Indiana, after a last-minute stay of execution was lifted by the US Supreme Court. The case attracted attention because her lawyers argued she was mentally ill and suffered serious abuse as a child. The 52-year-old strangled a pregnant woman before cutting out and kidnapping her baby in Missouri in 2004. Her victim, 23-year-old Bobbie Jo Stinnett, bled to death but her baby was safely recovered and returned to her family. Montgomery is the first female federal inmate to be put to death by the US government in 67 years. According to witnesses, a woman standing next to Montgomery during the execution process, removed the inmate's face mask and asked her if she had any last words. Montgomery responded ""no"", and said nothing else. She was pronounced dead at 01:31 (06:31 GMT). Montgomery's lawyer, Kelley Henry, said that everyone who had participated in the execution ""should feel shame"". ""The government stopped at nothing in its zeal to kill this damaged and delusional woman,"" she said in a statement. ""Lisa Montgomery's execution was far from justice."" Protesters demanding an end to the death penalty gathered outside the prison in Terre Haute, Indiana The latest execution was postponed twice - first by Covid-19, then by a judge - until a Supreme Court ruling cleared the way for it to take place in the early hours of Wednesday. In adramatic move late on Monday, a judge in Indiana had halted the scheduled injection until a mental competency hearing could be held. Her lawyers argued that she had been born brain-damaged and was too mentally ill to be executed. As a child she was routinely sexually and physically abused by her father and trafficked by her mother, family members said. Her treatment was so violent that it amounted to torture, her lawyers say. Her defence team believe that at the time of her crime, Montgomery was psychotic and out of touch with reality. That opinion is supported by 41 current and former lawyers as well as human rights groups like the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. But her victim's family and friends say the murder committed by Montgomery was so horrific that she deserved to be put to death regardless of her mental health. Lisa Montgomery: Looking for answers in the life of a killer In Trump's final days, a rush of federal executions US government death penalty move draws sharp criticism She killed 23-year-old Stinnett in Skidmore, Missouri, after befriending the pregnant woman online over a shared love of dogs. After driving to Stinnett's house, Montgomery overpowered the pregnant woman, strangled her with a piece of rope, and cut the baby out of her womb. Police found Montgomery cradling a new-born girl she claimed to have given birth to the day before. After her story fell apart, she confessed to the killing. She was found guilty of the crime in 2007. The next day, she was sentenced to death. Analysis by Jessica Lussenhop, BBC News, Washington The fight to save the life of a death row inmate is always dramatic up until the very last moment, and none more so than the fight to save Lisa Montgomery. Although only President Trump had the power to grant her clemency and commute her sentence to life in prison, if her lawyers were able to delay her execution until after President-elect Biden takes office, they would have effectively achieved the same thing. Biden has pledged to end the death penalty on the federal level. And so it all ended - as many death penalty cases do - in an 11th hour flurry of legal filings that pitted Montgomery's legal team against lawyers for the Department of Justice, who were urging the execution forward. Ultimately, the US Supreme Court ruled against Montgomery in all three of her final legal challenges, including one that argued that it would be unconstitutional to execute Montgomery because she is not mentally competent. Since 2008, Montgomery had been held in a federal prison in Texas for female inmates with special needs, where she has been receiving psychiatric care. Since receiving her execution date, she'd been placed on suicide watch in an isolated cell. Montgomery's lawyer, Ms Henry, said her original legal defence was woefully inadequate, and presented few of the details about her abuse, trauma and mental illness. The Supreme Court outlawed the death penalty at state and federal level in 1972 but reversed the decision four years later. Since 1976, 16 women other than Lisa Montgomery have been executed but all by individual states rather than by the government. Before Montgomery's execution, the last woman to be executed by the US government was Bonnie Heady, who died in a gas chamber in Missouri in 1953, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. Federal executions had been on pause for 17 years before President Donald Trump ordered them to resume earlier last year.

Republicans turn on Trump over impeachmentSome Republicans say they will join Democrats and vote to charge the president with inciting insurrection.US & Canada,"This video can not be played President Trump: ""Be careful what you wish for"" The US House of Representatives is deciding whether to impeach President Donald Trump over his role in last week's storming of Congress. Democrats accuse the president of encouraging his supporters to attack the Capitol building. Five people died. Some in Mr Trump's Republican party say they will join Democrats to impeach him on Wednesday, formally charging the president with inciting insurrection. President Trump has rejected any responsibility for the violence. The riot last Wednesday happened after Mr Trump told supporters at a rally in Washington DC to ""fight like hell"" against the result of November's election. As the House continued its debate, Mr Trump responded to the latest reports of planned protests, urging calm. ""I urge that there must be NO violence, NO lawbreaking and NO vandalism of any kind,"" he said in statement released by the White House. ""That is not what I stand for, and it is not what America stands for. ""I call on ALL Americans to help ease tensions and calm tempers. Thank You."" As Democrats hold a majority in the House, the vote is likely to pass. ""We have been asked to turn a blind eye to the criminality, corruption and blatant disregard to the rule of law by the tyrant president we have in the White House,"" Democratic Representative Ilhan Omar said in the House debate. ""We as a nation can no longer look away."" Follow our live updates Can Trump be removed or banned from politics? How many arrests so far from Capitol riots? Did Trump's words at rally incite the riot? At least nine Republicans have voted in favour impeachment, but the majority remain loyal to the president. ""Instead of moving forward as a unifying force, the majority in the House is choosing to divide us further... Let us look forward, not backward. Let us come together, not apart,"" Republican Tom Cole told the House. He was one of 139 Republicans who last week voted against accepting the result of the 2020 election and Mr Trump's defeat. Democratic congresswoman Ilhan Omar called on the House to vote to impeach Mr Trump Once it has passed in the House of Representatives, the impeachment article will then head for the Senate, where a trial will be held to determine the president's guilt. A two-thirds majority would be needed there to convict Mr Trump, meaning at least 17 Republicans would have to vote for conviction. As many as 20 Senate Republicans are open to convicting the president, the New York Times reports. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he had not yet decided whether or not he would vote in favour of impeachment. Mr McConnell has been a key ally for Mr Trump in achieving his legislative agenda and securing a conservative majority on many US courts, including the Supreme Court. The timeline for a potential trial is not clear but it will not finish before Mr Trump leaves office on 20 January, when Joe Biden will be sworn in as president. The Senate will not reconvene this week and probably not until 19 January, according to Mr McConnell's spokesman. The Senate could also use an impeachment trial to block Mr Trump from ever running for office again. He has indicated he plans to campaign for president in 2024. Wednesday's vote means that Mr Trump is likely to become the first US president ever to be impeached twice. In December 2019 he became the third president to be impeached, charged with breaking the law by asking Ukraine to investigate Mr Biden to boost his own chances of re-election. The Senate cleared him. What is impeachment?Impeachment is when a sitting president is charged with crimes. In this case, President Trump is accused of inciting insurrection by encouraging his supporters to storm the Capitol Could Trump be removed from office?A simple majority of the House of Representatives is enough to impeach him - but to remove him from office, he then needs to be convicted of those charges by the Senate, where a two-thirds majority required for conviction is not guaranteed So what does it mean?This is the second time Mr Trump will have been impeached, and even though a trial could begin after his term ends, a conviction could mean he is barred from holding public office again The third most senior Republican in the House, Liz Cheney, has vowed to back impeachment, saying Mr Trump had ""summoned this mob, assembled the mob, and lit the flame of this attack"". ""There has never been a greater betrayal by a president of the United States of his office and his oath to the Constitution,"" said the Wyoming representative, daughter of former Vice-President Dick Cheney. So far, eight more Republicans have voted in favour. Dan Newhouse, a Republican from Washington state, said: ""Turning a blind eye to this brutal assault on our Republic is not an option,external."" This video can not be played A day that shook America House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy, a Trump ally who has said he opposes impeachment, decided not to ask rank-and-file members of the party to vote against the measure, US media reported. According to the New York Times, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell told confidants he was pleased Democrats wanted to impeach the president because he believed it would help rid the Republican party of Mr Trump. On Tuesday, the House passed a resolution calling on Vice-President Mike Pence to help remove Mr Trump using the 25th Amendment - a plan Mr Pence rejected. With just a week left in his term, it now appears all but certain that Donald Trump will become the first president to be impeached twice. Unlike his first go through the process, this vote will have the support of at least a handful of Republicans - including Liz Cheney, a member of the party's House leadership team. There is also, unlike January 2020, a chance the Senate has enough votes to successfully convict the president. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's recent signals of approval are evidence of that. Of course, the primary consequence of Senate conviction - removal from office - seems of limited relevance with so little time left in the Trump presidency. Democrats, however, view impeachment as a formal way of marking their outrage at the president's behaviour, not just last week, but during his months of challenging and undermining November's election results. A successful conviction could also result in Trump's being banned from ever holding federal public office again and stripped of the privileges enjoyed by ex-presidents. That prospect alone, in the minds of Democrats (and, perhaps, some Republicans ready to break with Trumpism), makes impeachment worth the effort.

There's been a lot of coronavirus news around today - here are some of the main headlines: Jordan has launched a Covid-19 vaccination programme intended
to protect more than 20% of the kingdomâs 10 million population. The government has said the first stage will focus on people
over the age of 60, those with chronic illnesses, and medical personnel. It aims
to administer 5,000 shots a day at 29 centres. Health Minister Nazir Obeidattold the state news agency Petra,externalthat the first day had gone âsmoothlyâ. But the head of the ministryâs epidemics and communicable
diseases department, Wael Hayajneh,urged more people to register for the free vaccines,external, with
only 200,000 reportedly signed up since late December. The government has purchased vaccines produced by Pfizer-BioNTech
and China's Sinopharm. The latter was granted an âemergency licenceâ on Saturday. Jordan has seen a sharp fall in the daily number of new
infections since mid-November, when restrictions that
had been eased during the summer were reintroduced. More than 309,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19
and 4,076 deaths have been reported since the start of the pandemic. There's been focus this week on whether people are adhering to the rules around wearing face coverings in shops. Tesco, Asda and Waitrose have becomethe latest supermarkets to say they will deny entry to shoppers who do not wear face masks,  unless they are medically exempt. It follows a similar move by Morrisons, while Sainsbury's says it will challenge those who flout the rules. So what protection do masks offer, what sort can be worn, and what are the rules across the UK? Read our explainer here The education select committee chairman has asked the PM for the roadmap for reopening schools in England. Robert Halfon asked the prime minister about the mental health and social isolation effects on children being away from schools. Boris Johnson says the lockdown measures âhave got to continue to workâ, after showing âsome early signs of progressâ. But he says it was âfar, far too earlyâ to say that would lead to a relaxation next month. This video can not be played Covid-19: Johnson and Halfon on lockdown effect on children Gavin StampBBC political reporter The UK governmentâs Covid O
committee is expected to discuss the new variant of coronavirus that has
emerged in Brazil tomorrow. The prime minister hinted to MPs that there could be restrictions on travel from Brazil to the UK - but a final decision has not been taken. Speaking to MPs he said: ""We are taking steps to ensure that we do not see
the import of this new variant from Brazil."" The Catholic Archbishop of Glasgow has died after contracting Covid-19 shortly after Christmas. Philip Tartaglia, 70, was one of the most senior figures in the Catholic Church in Scotland. The Church said his cause of death was not yet clear. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she felt ""deep sadness"" to hear of Archbishop Tartaglia's death. She told Scottish Parliament: ""I'm sure that is sadness shared by everybody across this chamber - and to send my deepest condolences to his loved ones and of course everybody in his community."" Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf said he had ""many fond memories"" of conversations he had shared with the archbishop. Philip Tartaglia was born in Glasgow in 1951 and was appointed Archbishop of Glasgow in 2012. He died on 13 January, which is the Feast of St Mungo - the patron saint of Glasgow. More than 9.3 million of Americans have received the first shot of a Covid vaccine The US has been by far the world's worst-hit nation in the pandemic, with Johns Hopkins University reporting late on Tuesday a record 4,470 Covid-related deaths in the past 24 hours. Here are the latest key developments in America on Wednesday:  The US has had more than 22 million confirmed infections since the start of the outbreak, according to Johns Hopkins. The overall Covid-related death toll has now exceeded 380,000, and is closing in fast on the number of American soldiers killed in World War Two, at about 407,000. Doctors' leaders have called for urgent improvements in personal protective equipment for health workers. The British Medical Association isappealing for a higher grade of face maskto guard against coronavirus infection. It says there is 'growing evidence' that the virus is being spread through the air by aerosols. These are tiny virus particles that can build up in stuffy rooms and they have been linked to outbreaks of Covid-19. This follows an open letter from more than 1,500 health professionals for staff on general wards to be given the type of high-quality masks usually only worn in intensive care units. Public Health England (PHE) has issued guidance on what PPE staff in different settings require. It was last updatedin October 2020,external. And you canread our explainer hereon face masks, including what protection they offer, what sort can be worn, and what the rules are across the UK. A highly contagious strain of coronavirus first detected in South Africa has spread to 20 countries, the WHO says The World Health Organisation (WHO) has expressed concern about the spread of new coronavirus variants. A highly infectious strain, which originated in the UK, has now spread to 50 countries and territories, the WHO said. Since the strain was first detected late last year, it has driven a spike in coronavirus infections and deaths linked to the disease in the UK. A strain first identified in South Africa, meanwhile, has spread to 20 other countries, the WHO said. Health experts say both new variants appear to be more transmissible than previous strains but not necessarily any more dangerous. They have also played down the possibility that vaccines will not be as effective against these variants. Still, the increased transmission of these variants is taking its toll. ""Going into a second year of this [pandemic] could even be tougher given some of the transmission dynamics,"" WHO expert Mike Ryan said during an event on social media. There are also concerns about a third new strain the Japanese authorities have identified in four people who are thought to have caught it in Brazil. BBC Radio 5 Live The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has been a major plank of the government's support during the pandemic. Under the furlough scheme, the government pays up to 80% of employees' wages up to Â£2,500. But it has been found to be open to abuse. New figures from HMRC given to BBC Radio 5 Live's Wake Up to Money programme show the department ishandling more than 21,000 reportsof suspected fraudulent use of the furlough scheme, 5,000 of which are under formal investigation. The money is either due to fraudulent claims, or is being paid out in error. The number of tip offs has spiralled sincelast April, from 3,000 to 21,378 reports of suspect payments by early January. HMRC told the BBC: ""This is taxpayers' money and fraudulent claims limit our ability to support people and deprive public services of essential funding."" The DUPâs Ian Paisley has failed to trigger an emergency Commons debate on the discarding of donated kidneys during the coronavirus pandemic. The MP for North Antrim said he had heard some viable organs had been discarded, and called for transplant operations to continue, perhaps using private facilities. Deputy Speaker Eleanor Laing later told him it would be not be allowed, but said a health minister was present and listening to his request. This video can not be played Covid-19: DUP MP says donated kidney discarded in pandemic Lisa SummersBBC Scotland Health Correspondent We heard earlier from Nicola Sturgeon thatrestrictions in Scotland will tightenfrom Saturday. The Scottish government is acting now because of the strain on the health service. Its experts are warning the NHS could beoverwhelmed even under a 'stay at home' scenario,external. We've already seen two health boards postponing all non-urgent surgical procedures as an increase in Covid cases puts growing pressure on the system. The action from NHS Lanarkshire and NHS Ayrshire and Arran is showing how the numbers of Covid patients in hospital is really starting to impact on wider care. Wards that would usually treat people recovering from hip or knee replacements for example may need to be converted into Covid wards. Theatres, usually busy carrying out multiple routine surgeries will become high dependency or intensive care facilities. When staff need to be redeployed to work with Covid patients, it is not safe to carry out other routine work. These are the difficult choices many health boards will face over the coming weeks. Action required now to deal with this health emergency will have consequences later. Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva The event at Wengen is one of the most prestigious at the Ski World Cup Switzerlandâs iconic Lauberhorn ski race has been cancelled because of rising cases of Covid-19, many of them, Swiss health officials say, spread by one British tourist. The resort of Wengen, where the famous race is held, had recorded no cases of the virus until October, and only ten until mid-December. After that, cases began to shoot up, and, worryingly, sequencing revealed many of them were the new highly infectious variant first detected in the UK. Contact tracers found that 27 of the cases alone could be linked to one British tourist who recently stayed in a Wengen hotel. Wengen desperately tried to save the race, offering to close off the resort to everyone but competitors, and even closing its schools. At first Swiss health officials agreed, but when, at the start of this week yet more Covid-19 cases were recorded, they pulled the emergency brake. Wengen is devastated. The Lauberhorn is not just any race, but one of the top competitions on the Ski World Cup circuit. It is dearly loved by the Swiss, who have watched with delight as some of their own home-grown talent - such as Beat Feuz and Carlo Janka - triumphed there. Rachel SchraerBBC Health Reporter As MPs have been mentioning today - a coronavirus variant has been found circulating in the Amazonas state of Brazil, and was picked up in Japan in travellers from the region. Itâs different from the UK and South African variants, but it contains common mutations - two changes to the virusâ ""spike"" in particular which have been flagged as potentially making the virus more infectious. This is not going to be the last mutation we hear about. At the moment changes are mainly being picked up in areas that do lots of genetic tracking of the virus - itâs almost certain there are other mutations already circulating unseen in other parts of the world. And the virus will continue to mutate - itâs just a question of how, how much and how fast. For now thereâs no evidence the virus is becoming more dangerous - but if more people catch it then, left unchecked, more will potentially become ill or die. But the vaccines, which target several different areas of the virusâ spike, should still work - though thatâs something that scientists the world over will be monitoring very closely. There have now been more deaths in the second wave of the pandemic than the first, Public Health England's medical director has said. Dr Yvonne Doyle was reacting to the new record of 1,564 deaths within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus in the UK that have been announced this hour. She said: âWith each passing day, more and more people are tragically losing their lives to this terrible virus, and today we have reported the highest number of deaths on a single day since the pandemic began. ""There have now been more deaths in the second wave than the first. âAbout one-in-three people with Covid-19 donât show symptoms, but can still pass it on to others so it is essential that we stay at home, minimise contact with other people and act as if you have the virus.â Labour's chair of the Home Affairs Committee Yvette Cooper, points out loopholes for travellers arriving home from abroad - including travelling on UK public transport when coming back from a holiday destination. Mr Johnson says there is a ""balanced approach"" from the government on the health of the nation vs the health of the economy. Ms Cooper says other countries brought in negative Covid tests as a requirement to travel ""months ago"" whereas the UK is only bringing these in from Friday. Mr Johnson says 3.5m passengers have been spot-checked since June 2020. He says a ""great deal of work"" goes into checking ""passenger data forms"" to check where people have come from. Ms Cooper says over 90% of those passenger data forms are not being checked. She says these checks ""might as well be voluntary"". Mr Johnson replies that those arriving from abroad are being screened. Ms Cooper asks why people from Brazil are not being checked for Covid, considering that there is a new strain in the South American country which could undermine the UK's vaccination programme. ""We are taking steps to ensure"" that the UK doesn't see the new variant in Brazil coming to the UK, replies Mr Johnson. Caroline Nokes, who chairs Parliament's Women and Equalities Commitee, then asks the PM about access to healthcare during the pandemic. She says the evidence shows it is women who are finding accessing services difficult, referring to a constituent who said her surgery was not currently doing smear tests. Nokes asks the PM what is an acceptable wait for a smear test? The PM says he sympathises with anybody who has had their treatment delayed. ""Sadly, that's what we are seeing. We're seeing delays in cancer, we're seeing delays in smear tests and vital services that people need, and that's a result in the increase in the numbers of Covid patients and that's why we have to work flat out to get the virus under control and reduce the current wave and give people the service we need."" Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Perhaps the most distressing element about the latest Covid deaths is that the numbers are almost certainly going to rise from here. People who are dying now are likely to have been infected around three weeks ago. That was at a point when infection rates were rising quite steeply, so in the coming days and weeks we should, sadly, expect to see more deaths than this. Todayâs figures are affected by the weekend, which sees delays reporting deaths that tend to translate into higher figures from Tuesday onwards. Currently around 800 to 900 people a day on average are dying once you take this into account. But the figures also provide some hope. For the third day, in a row the number of newly diagnosed infections are well below 50,000. There had been several days where they have exceeded 60,000. If that trend continues, and the number of new cases keeps coming down, that will eventually translate into the number of deaths falling. But it is going to take some weeks for that to happen. These are, as many have been saying, the darkest days of the pandemic so far. Caroline Nokes, who chairs Parliament's Women and Equalities Committee, asks the PM what additional protections are being put in place to help victims of domestic abuse who have insecure immigration status. The PM says the government has done ""what we can"" since the start of the pandemic to encourage victims of domestic abuse to come forward, including setting up helplines and investing in independent domestic abuse advisers. He says lockdown rules don't apply to victims of domestic abuse. Nokes follows up by asking why a better job is not being done of explaining lockdown rules to vulnerable people - for example, those who rely on British Sign Language or who might have learning difficulties. The PM says he has been asked a couple of times about sign language in particular, and he is going to ""take that away and see what we can do to increase sign language"". He adds that campaigns the government have produced are available in accessible formats and translations. Â© 2025 BBC.

Republicans turn on Trump over impeachmentSome Republicans say they will join Democrats and vote to charge the president with inciting insurrection.,"This video can not be played President Trump: ""Be careful what you wish for"" The US House of Representatives is deciding whether to impeach President Donald Trump over his role in last week's storming of Congress. Democrats accuse the president of encouraging his supporters to attack the Capitol building. Five people died. Some in Mr Trump's Republican party say they will join Democrats to impeach him on Wednesday, formally charging the president with inciting insurrection. President Trump has rejected any responsibility for the violence. The riot last Wednesday happened after Mr Trump told supporters at a rally in Washington DC to ""fight like hell"" against the result of November's election. As the House continued its debate, Mr Trump responded to the latest reports of planned protests, urging calm. ""I urge that there must be NO violence, NO lawbreaking and NO vandalism of any kind,"" he said in statement released by the White House. ""That is not what I stand for, and it is not what America stands for. ""I call on ALL Americans to help ease tensions and calm tempers. Thank You."" As Democrats hold a majority in the House, the vote is likely to pass. ""We have been asked to turn a blind eye to the criminality, corruption and blatant disregard to the rule of law by the tyrant president we have in the White House,"" Democratic Representative Ilhan Omar said in the House debate. ""We as a nation can no longer look away."" Follow our live updates Can Trump be removed or banned from politics? How many arrests so far from Capitol riots? Did Trump's words at rally incite the riot? At least nine Republicans have voted in favour impeachment, but the majority remain loyal to the president. ""Instead of moving forward as a unifying force, the majority in the House is choosing to divide us further... Let us look forward, not backward. Let us come together, not apart,"" Republican Tom Cole told the House. He was one of 139 Republicans who last week voted against accepting the result of the 2020 election and Mr Trump's defeat. Democratic congresswoman Ilhan Omar called on the House to vote to impeach Mr Trump Once it has passed in the House of Representatives, the impeachment article will then head for the Senate, where a trial will be held to determine the president's guilt. A two-thirds majority would be needed there to convict Mr Trump, meaning at least 17 Republicans would have to vote for conviction. As many as 20 Senate Republicans are open to convicting the president, the New York Times reports. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he had not yet decided whether or not he would vote in favour of impeachment. Mr McConnell has been a key ally for Mr Trump in achieving his legislative agenda and securing a conservative majority on many US courts, including the Supreme Court. The timeline for a potential trial is not clear but it will not finish before Mr Trump leaves office on 20 January, when Joe Biden will be sworn in as president. The Senate will not reconvene this week and probably not until 19 January, according to Mr McConnell's spokesman. The Senate could also use an impeachment trial to block Mr Trump from ever running for office again. He has indicated he plans to campaign for president in 2024. Wednesday's vote means that Mr Trump is likely to become the first US president ever to be impeached twice. In December 2019 he became the third president to be impeached, charged with breaking the law by asking Ukraine to investigate Mr Biden to boost his own chances of re-election. The Senate cleared him. What is impeachment?Impeachment is when a sitting president is charged with crimes. In this case, President Trump is accused of inciting insurrection by encouraging his supporters to storm the Capitol Could Trump be removed from office?A simple majority of the House of Representatives is enough to impeach him - but to remove him from office, he then needs to be convicted of those charges by the Senate, where a two-thirds majority required for conviction is not guaranteed So what does it mean?This is the second time Mr Trump will have been impeached, and even though a trial could begin after his term ends, a conviction could mean he is barred from holding public office again The third most senior Republican in the House, Liz Cheney, has vowed to back impeachment, saying Mr Trump had ""summoned this mob, assembled the mob, and lit the flame of this attack"". ""There has never been a greater betrayal by a president of the United States of his office and his oath to the Constitution,"" said the Wyoming representative, daughter of former Vice-President Dick Cheney. So far, eight more Republicans have voted in favour. Dan Newhouse, a Republican from Washington state, said: ""Turning a blind eye to this brutal assault on our Republic is not an option,external."" This video can not be played A day that shook America House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy, a Trump ally who has said he opposes impeachment, decided not to ask rank-and-file members of the party to vote against the measure, US media reported. According to the New York Times, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell told confidants he was pleased Democrats wanted to impeach the president because he believed it would help rid the Republican party of Mr Trump. On Tuesday, the House passed a resolution calling on Vice-President Mike Pence to help remove Mr Trump using the 25th Amendment - a plan Mr Pence rejected. With just a week left in his term, it now appears all but certain that Donald Trump will become the first president to be impeached twice. Unlike his first go through the process, this vote will have the support of at least a handful of Republicans - including Liz Cheney, a member of the party's House leadership team. There is also, unlike January 2020, a chance the Senate has enough votes to successfully convict the president. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's recent signals of approval are evidence of that. Of course, the primary consequence of Senate conviction - removal from office - seems of limited relevance with so little time left in the Trump presidency. Democrats, however, view impeachment as a formal way of marking their outrage at the president's behaviour, not just last week, but during his months of challenging and undermining November's election results. A successful conviction could also result in Trump's being banned from ever holding federal public office again and stripped of the privileges enjoyed by ex-presidents. That prospect alone, in the minds of Democrats (and, perhaps, some Republicans ready to break with Trumpism), makes impeachment worth the effort.

'We can make this the peak',"This video can not be played Matt Hancock: 'Together we can make this the peak' ""We can make this the peak"" of the coronavirus pandemic ""if enough people follow the rules"", Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said. He told BBC Breakfast it was ""those individual decisions"" that determine the virus's spread and it ""comes down to the behaviour of everyone"". People ""shouldn't take the mickey out of the rules,"" he said. Under the national lockdown, people in England must stay at home and only go out for limited reasons. This includes for food shopping, exercise, or work if they cannot do so from home. Similar measures are in place across much of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Latest figures show there are now more than 35,000 people in hospital with Covid - an increase on the spring peak. It comes as Prime Minister Boris Johnson is set to be questioned by MPs on the vaccine rollout later. Meanwhile, Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon is also due to announce whether there will be any changes to lockdown restrictions later. Ministershave been discussingthe possibility of tightening the current restrictions. Can I hug my vaccinated dad? And other questions What is a 'reasonable excuse' for leaving home? Postcode check: Find out the rules where you live Large trial of new Covid treatment begins in UK When asked on BBC Breakfast if this was the peak of this wave of the pandemic, Mr Hancock replied: ""I want it to be, but that comes down to the behaviour of everyone. ""Together we can make this the peak if enough people follow the rules which are incredibly clear."" Mr Hancock said England's lockdown measures were ""always under review"", but he would be ""very reluctant"" to remove the rule of meeting one other person outside for exercise as ""it is a lifeline"" for some people, including those who live alone. Mr Hancock has already ruled out scrapping support bubbles. ""What I'd rather is that everybody follow that rule and doesn't stretch it or flex it,"" he said. On the news that patients at a hospital in London are to be discharged early and sent to a hotel to help free up beds for critically ill coronavirus patients, Mr Hancock said moving patients to hotels ""isn't something we are actively putting in place"". King's College Hospital said it would help to create space for the ""high numbers"" of new admissions and would ""temporarily accommodate mainly homeless patients who are ready to safely leave hospital and will benefit from further support from community partners"". There are very early signs that infections may have peaked - although as always we should be careful about reading too much into a few days' worth of data. The past two days have seen newly diagnosed cases hover around the 46,000-mark. Up to the weekend, the average was close to 60,000. The drop has largely been driven by falls in new cases in London, the South East and East of England. The national picture does mask some regional differences. Cases are rising in the North West, which is causing particular concern. It is too early for the vaccination programme to be having any significant impact so a combination of the national lockdown on top of the tier four restrictions that were imposed in some areas before Christmas look like they may be beginning to have an impact. There is also some evidence the new variant may not be quite as fast-spreading as first feared - a Public Health England study suggested rather than being 70% more transmissible it may actually be somewhere between 30% to 50%. And, if it does represent the start of a continuous fall, it is important to remember it will still take some time to translate into fewer hospital cases - people being admitted at the moment are those who would have caught the virus a week or two ago. But after six weeks of pretty sustained rises, it is at least an encouraging sign. Asked aboutimages of elite footballers celebrating goals with hugs, Mr Hancock said: ""I think elite sport is important because these are tough times, and being able to watch the football on the telly is really important because there's loads of things that you can't do."" He said the Premier League has ""special arrangements to ensure that players are safe"" as well as a testing regime. The health secretary told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the rollout of the coronavirus vaccine will accelerate over the coming weeks, saying they were ""on track"" to deliver it to 14 million people by mid-February. Vaccines deployment minister Nadhim Zahawi later told the Commons' science and technology committee that he was ""confident"" of achieving this target. More than 2.4 million people have now had a first dose of a coronavirus vaccine, while 412,167 people have had a second dose. Mr Hancock said 40% of the 3.4m people over 80 in England had been vaccinated so far. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? YOUR QUESTIONS:We answer your queries GLOBAL SPREAD:How many worldwide cases are there? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters ""We have the capacity to get that vaccine out. The challenge is that we need to get the vaccine in,"" Mr Hancock said. ""What I know is that the supply will increase over the next few weeks and that means the very rapid rate that we are going at at the moment will continue to accelerate over the next couple of weeks."" On Tuesday, NHS Providers chief executive Chris Hopson said it was ""pretty clear"" that because of the new strain the Covid-19 infection rate was not going to go down as quickly as it did during the first wave. ""It now looks like the peak for NHS demand may actually be in February,"" he said.

What should be in free school meals?,"The number of children eligible for free school meals in England has risen since the start of the pandemic. As the summer holidays approach, what support will be available to them? More than one in five pupils (1.7 million) in England were eligible in January 2021. The number rose by more than 400,000 in the previous 10 months, from the start of the first lockdown in March 2020. Although numbers have increased in previous years, the 2020 rise was steeper than before. Children are eligible if their household income is less than Â£7,400 (excluding benefits) or if they receive certain welfare payments. Most children on free school meals are at state-funded primary schools. The rate is highest in north-east England. Unlike last summer, the government is not directly funding vouchers or food packages this year. Free school meals have traditionally been provided in term time only. But manycouncils,externalhave decided to create their own meal schemes during the long holiday -using extra government money made available,externalbecause of the pandemic. Labour called on ministers to ""trust parents"" by giving them cash payments over the summer. But instead, rather than offer free meals, the government has allocated Â£220m for local councils to offer free holiday clubs. These clubs will offer free healthy food and physical activities. Funding is expected to cover activities for at least four hours a day, four days a week, for four weeks of the holidays. The scheme - the Holiday Activities and Food Programme - was launched as a pilot before the pandemic, but is now being rolled out across England. Councils are expected to offer free club access to all children eligible for free school meals. Children who do not receive free meals may still be offered places, but not for free. Footballer Marcus Rashford, and other campaigners,has been promoting,externalthe holiday clubs. The Manchester United player had previously called for free school meal support to be extended again this summer. But since then, he has said the holiday clubs programme is a ""massive"" opportunity for kids. Marcus Rashford became a prominent campaigner for free school meals in 2020 InScotland, the government has allocated Â£22 million of funding to allow councils to provide some free meal support during school holidays. It is up to local authorities todecide what the support will be,external. InNorthern Ireland, the government is offering food grants for eligible childrenduring all school holidays until April 2022. Local authorities inWaleswill be able to claim Â£19.50 per week for each eligible child to make free meal supportavailable in the holidays,external. First 2020 lockdown- families with children on free school meals were offered food packages or vouchers during term-time Easter 2020- a campaign (later backed by Marcus Rashford) led to ministers extending the support over the holidays Summer 2020- additional funding was put in place so children eligible for free school meals could claim a six-week voucher November 2020- a funding package, the Covid Winter Grant Scheme, was introduced to support families January 2021- the original term-time voucher scheme returned in lockdown, but with parents expected to rely on winter grant money during holidays Charities have stepped in to help families in need during the pandemic Free school meals during term-time have been at least partially funded by the government for more than a century. Children of all ages - from nursery to sixth form -may be eligible if they live in households receiving income-related benefits,,externalincluding: Income support Income-based jobseeker's allowance Income-related employment and support allowance Universal credit New claims made in England must come from households earning a maximum income of Â£7,400 a year after tax, not including benefits. All infant state school pupils (Reception, Years 1 and 2) can get free school meals. If your child is getting free school meals on 31 March 2022, they'll keep getting them until they finish their stage of education, for example primary or secondary. Eligibility varies slightly betweenEngland,external,Wales,external,Scotland,externalandNorthern Ireland,externalbecause the nations set their own rules. The household-income threshold in Scotland and Wales is also Â£7,400. In Northern Ireland it is Â£14,000.

Leila NathooBBC political correspondent Sir Keir Starmer tried to pin the blame for meagre food parcels sent to some school children studying at home, on the government rather than individual suppliers. He claimed there wasnât actually much difference between the packages that the PM described as âdisgracefulâ and âan insult to familiesâ and an example of a package set out in official guidance. Downing St sources say he was âselectively quotingâ from that guidance and that the images highlighted on social media donât come close to whatâs recommended. But it's clear the issue of free school meals is a sensitive one for the government, and one that provides a bruise for Labour to press. Allow Twitter content?

Reality Check At Prime Ministerâs Questions, Boris Johnson said that âthe lockdown measures we had in place, combined with tier four measures, are starting to show some signs of effect.â Looking at cases of Covid-19 in England, the average for the week ending 1 January was almost 55,000 cases. The week ending 6 January shows a slight dip, to 52,400. These people will have been infected before Englandâs lockdown came in on January 6, although much of the country was under very strict measures before then. So, using publicly available data, it might be too early to make this assessment. And in the past month, weâve seen that a couple of days of decline can quickly be followed by a sustained increase in cases. But what is clear is that hospital admissions from coronavirus appear to be increasing (they usually peak up to a couple of weeks after high numbers of cases). The latest seven day average (ending on January 7) saw 3,705 people admitted to hospital daily in England â thatâs the highest throughout the entire pandemic.  BBC Politics Here's a recap on the main talking points from PMQs: Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle has brought PMQs to a close. Standby for a quick recap.... Labour's Andrew Slaughter says he has received an email from a teacher who says that ""lack of government guidance means her staff will soon be over 100 children - ten times as many as in the first lockdown"". He says ""lockdown in name only may suit the PM"" and accuses Mr Johnson of ""bending the rules himself"". Boris Johnson thanks all schools throughout the country and says that everyone ""wants to see the children of key workers and vulnerable children getting the education they need"". Conservative Andrea Leadsom says the lockdown has been ""awful"" for new parents and seeks reassurance from the PM that the recommendations of her review into early years will form ""a core part"" of his ambition to ""build back better"". Boris Johnson praises her passion for the issue and says he looks forward to working with her ""to achieve the change we want"". Ben Everitt MP In response to a question from Tory Ben Everitt about knife crime in his community, the PM says the government is acting across the board, through introducing knife crime protection orders, getting 6,000 more police officers on the beat and deterring criminals through ""continuous and serious law enforcement"". He adds that those caught with a knife in their possession should get the sentences they deserve. SNP MP Gavin Newlands says British Gas and British Airways' practices of firing and rehiring staff to force new terms and conditions is ""shameful"". He says he has a bill with cross-party support which would outlaw the practice, he asks for a meeting with the PM to discuss it. Mr Johnson says ""there are laws in place to ensure that contractual conditions"" cannot discriminate, but the government is meeting with the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (ACAS) to see what else can be done. Labour's Karl Turner says the government should make use of pharmacies who ""stand willing and able to deliver desperately-needed vaccines"". He accuses the government of ""shunning"" the ""fully-trained technicians"" who work in pharmacies. Boris Johnson says pharmacies do an amazing job but adds that ""we want to ensure we get doses to the places where they are going to get distributed most effectively. ""We need to avoid any wastage at all - that is why we are concentrating on the hospitals and mass vaccination sites."" Labour's Kevin Brennan asks about visas for British musicians to perform in the EU and vice versa, saying it is disappointing that a reciprocal deal has yet to be agreed. He says the issue is fixable but needs leadership from the top. He urges a cross-party approach to sort this out as soon as possible, given the damage he says it will do to the UK's reputation as one of the leading cultural centres in Europe. The PM agrees, saying he expects the EU will want to do more to facilitate easy travel for musicians and other professionals across a range of sectors, saying there is a ""mutual benefit"".  The Lib Dem's deputy leader Daisy Cooper says the vaccination drive in her local area is being hampered because the supply is inconsistent and often arrives at short notice. She asks the PM to ""personally intervene"" to ensure all centres have ""a greater and more consistent"" supply. Boris Johnson says the constraint is not the distribution network but the supply. He says the UK has a bigger supply than most other European countries. DUP MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson says his constituency has ""empty supermarket shelves"" and people cannot get materials or ship things over from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. He asks if the Northern Ireland Protocol can be invoked to help provide direct government intervention to help resolve Northern Ireland shipping problems. Mr Johnson says ""there are teething problems"" but there are no issues holding up goods. He says if the situation worsens then there will be no hesitation in invoking the Protocol to help Northern Ireland. The Northern Ireland Protocol was a key part of the withdrawal agreement the UK and EU agreed in 2019 as part of the UK's divorce from the bloc. You canread a bit more background on the NI Protocol here. We're now on to questions from backbenchers. Tory Julian Sturdy says progress on the vaccination rollout is very encouraging and seeks assurances that it is the PM's ""over-riding priority"" to lift the current nationwide restrictions at the earliest opportunity when current targets are met and ""immunity widens"". The PM promises a ""phased relaxation of controls"" when all the top four categories of most vulnerable groups - that's about 15 million people - have been innoculated. But he says this must be consistent with protecting the NHS and ensuring it is not overwhelmed. Leila NathooBBC political correspondent Pressed earlier by the Labour leader on why current restrictions in England are looser now than they were in March, Boris Johnson said the measures were starting to show signs of some effect and pointed to the damaging effects of lockdown. The PM seems determined to stick to the current framework for now â while still stressing that people must follow the rules.  Mr Blackford says the PM's reply was ""an insult"" to fishermen. He says Scottish seafood exporters are losing ""upwards of Â£1m in sales a day"". He asks the PM if the government will provide compensation to the fishing industry. Boris Johnson says the SNP's policy of an independent Scotland would be ""destructive to the Scottish economy"". He says the party should be focused on fighting the pandemic. The SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford says his constituent is experiencing his ""worst nightmare"". He says his constituent lost Â£40,000 of produce after a lorry-load of seafood was held up by ""Brexit red tape"". ""Where is the sea of opportunity that he and his Scottish Tories promised,"" Mr Blackford asks. Boris Johnson replies that his government is investing Â£100m into the fishing industry. He says the SNP wants to break up the UK under ""a hare brain scheme"" and accuses the party of wanting to ""hand back control of fisheries to Brussels"". Â© 2025 BBC.

Brazil data shows China vaccine 50.4% effectiveLatest results show Sinovac's Covid-19 vaccine is less effective in Brazil than previously suggested.Latin America & Caribbean,"The Chinese vaccine is one of two that the Brazilian government has lined up A coronavirus vaccine developed by China's Sinovac has been found to be 50.4% effective in Brazilian clinical trials, according to the latest results released by researchers. It shows the vaccine is significantly less effective than previous data suggested - barely over the 50% needed for regulatory approval. The Chinese vaccine is one of two that the Brazilian government has lined up. Brazil has been one of the countries worst affected by Covid-19. Sinovac, a Beijing-based biopharmaceutical company, is behind CoronaVac, an inactivated vaccine. It works by using killed viral particles to expose the body's immune system to the virus without risking a serious disease response. Several countries, including Indonesia, Turkey and Singapore, have placed orders for the vaccine. What do we know about China's Covid-19 vaccines? How do I know the Covid vaccine is safe? Last week researchers at the Butantan Institute, which has been conducting the trials in Brazil, announced that the vaccine had a 78% efficacy against ""mild-to-severe"" Covid-19 cases. But on Tuesday they revealed that calculations for this figure did not include data from a group of ""very mild infections"" among those who received the vaccine that did not require clinical assistance. With the inclusion of this data, the efficacy rate is now 50.4%, said researchers. But Butantan stressed that the vaccine is 78% effective in preventing mild cases that needed treatment and 100% effective in staving off moderate to serious cases. The Sinovac trials have yielded different results across different countries. Last month Turkish researchers said the Sinovac vaccine was 91.25% effective, while Indonesia,which rolled out its mass vaccination programme on Wednesday, said it was 65.3% effective. Both were interim results from late-stage trials. By Philippa Roxby, BBC Health reporter The latest figures for China's coronavirus vaccine show just how difficult it is to compare vaccines. On the face of it, the 50% effectiveness figure isn't as good as Oxford's 70% or Pfizer and Moderna's 95%. But trials are run very differently in different countries - the numbers of volunteers enrolled varies wildly, as do the criteria used to test how much protection the vaccines offer. A figure for efficacy is reached by looking at how many people developed Covid after being given the vaccine, compared with how many were affected when given a dummy injection. Normally, that is based on people developing obvious symptoms but in this Brazilian trial, people with no symptoms also appear to have been included. So it's only when the full data from all trials of this vaccine are published that scientists can analyse its real efficacy, and compare like with like. Only limited data for this Sinovac vaccine is currently available - and experts say that is confusing the picture. In the long term, many vaccines against Covid are needed to vaccinate the world and, inevitably, some will perform better than others - but giving as many people as possible some protection is the priority. There has been concern and criticism that Chinese vaccine trials are not subject to the same scrutiny and levels of transparency as its Western counterparts. Both the Sinovac vaccine and the vaccine developed by Oxford University and pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca have requests for emergency use authorisation pending with regulators in Brazil.

The country currently has the third highest number of Covid-19 cases in the world at over 8.1 million, just behind the US and India. The BBC World Service's Americas editor Candace Piette says the country is suffering one of the world's deadliest outbreaks but as yet, has not announced when its vaccination programme will begin. The delay has been caused in large part by the government's haphazard and divided approach to vaccination, says our correspondent. What do we know about China's Covid-19 vaccines?

Reality Check At Prime Ministerâs Questions, Boris Johnson said that âthe lockdown measures we had in place, combined with tier four measures, are starting to show some signs of effect.â Looking at cases of Covid-19 in England, the average for the week ending 1 January was almost 55,000 cases. The week ending 6 January shows a slight dip, to 52,400. These people will have been infected before Englandâs lockdown came in on January 6, although much of the country was under very strict measures before then. So, using publicly available data, it might be too early to make this assessment. And in the past month, weâve seen that a couple of days of decline can quickly be followed by a sustained increase in cases. But what is clear is that hospital admissions from coronavirus appear to be increasing (they usually peak up to a couple of weeks after high numbers of cases). The latest seven day average (ending on January 7) saw 3,705 people admitted to hospital daily in England â thatâs the highest throughout the entire pandemic.

Boris Johnson thanks all schools throughout the country and says that everyone ""wants to see the children of key workers and vulnerable children getting the education they need"".

Boris Johnson praises her passion for the issue and says he looks forward to working with her ""to achieve the change we want"". Ben Everitt MP In response to a question from Tory Ben Everitt about knife crime in his community, the PM says the government is acting across the board, through introducing knife crime protection orders, getting 6,000 more police officers on the beat and deterring criminals through ""continuous and serious law enforcement"". He adds that those caught with a knife in their possession should get the sentences they deserve. SNP MP Gavin Newlands says British Gas and British Airways' practices of firing and rehiring staff to force new terms and conditions is ""shameful"". He says he has a bill with cross-party support which would outlaw the practice, he asks for a meeting with the PM to discuss it. Mr Johnson says ""there are laws in place to ensure that contractual conditions"" cannot discriminate, but the government is meeting with the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (ACAS) to see what else can be done. Labour's Karl Turner says the government should make use of pharmacies who ""stand willing and able to deliver desperately-needed vaccines"".

Large trial of new Covid treatment begins in UKIt is hoped the treatment will help stop patients from developing severe illness from the virus.,"Kaye Flitney is one of those enrolled on the clinical trial A large-scale trial of a new treatment it is hoped will help stop Covid-19 patients from developing severe illness has begun in the UK. The first patient received the treatment at Hull Royal Infirmary on Tuesday afternoon. It involves inhaling a protein called interferon beta which the body produces when it gets a viral infection. The hope is it will stimulate the immune system, priming cells to be ready to fight off viruses. Early findings suggested the treatment cut the odds of a Covid-19 patient in hospital developing severe disease - such as requiring ventilation - by almost 80%. It was developed at Southampton University Hospital and is being produced by the Southampton-based biotech company, Synairgen. A course of treatment with the new drug could cost around Â£2,000, which is not that expensive for a hospital treatment. ""To be viable it will have to represent good value for money,"" Synairgen's chief executive Richard Marsden said. Covid: UK at 'worst point' of pandemic, says Hancock Two more life-saving Covid drugs discovered What drugs can help treat coronavirus? Alexandra Constantin, 34, was the first person to receive the treatment as part of this new trial, after she was admitted to the hospital with coronavirus on Monday. She has a young daughter at home she is desperate to get back to. Demonstrating the treatment, the nurse handed her a nebuliser that makes the drug into a fine mist, which Alexandra inhaled as deep into her lungs as she could. Interferon beta is part of the body's first line of defence against viruses, warning it to expect a viral attack. The coronavirus seems to suppress its production as part of its strategy to evade our immune systems. The new drug is a special formulation of interferon beta delivered directly to the airways via a nebuliser which makes the protein into an aerosol. The idea is that a direct dose of the protein in the lungs will trigger a stronger anti-viral response, even in patients whose immune systems are already weak. Interferon beta is commonly used in the treatment of multiple sclerosis. Previous clinical trials conducted by Synairgen have shown that it can stimulate an immune response and that patients with asthma and other chronic lung conditions can comfortably tolerate the treatment. The results of a smaller, phase two clinical trial of the treatment conducted last year were promising. It suggested the chances of a Covid-19 patient in hospital getting severe disease - requiring ventilation, for example - were reduced by almost 80%. Patients were two to three times more likely to recover to the point where everyday activities were not compromised by their illness, Synairgen claimed. It said the trial also indicated ""very significant"" reductions in breathlessness among patients who received the treatment. In addition, the average time patients spent in hospital is said to have been reduced by a third, for those receiving the new drug - down from an average of nine days to six days. But the trial was small, just 100 patients, and more testing is needed before it can be authorised for use. This new ""phase three"" trial is much larger. It will involve more than 600 patients in 20 countries. As in the earlier trial, half the participants will be given the drug, the other half will get what is known as a placebo - an inactive substance. The team running the trial say they hope it will be completed by early summer. If the results are anywhere near as good as in the earlier trial, they expect authorisation for the drug to be used in patients in the UK and other countries to follow shortly afterwards. This video can not be played Synairgen CEO Richard Marsden explains how the treatment uses the protein interferon beta to help fight the virus ""If we had a positive study, we would hope to move rapidly into scaled manufacture and delivery of the drug in clinical practice,"" said Prof Tom Wilkinson, of the University of Southampton, who is overseeing the trial. He added that he believes the new drug - if it proves effective - will be a complement to the vaccines that are being rolled out. He also pointed out it would take a long time for the whole world to be vaccinated. There will need to be treatments for people who miss out on vaccination or choose not to get the jab. There is also the risk the virus mutates and vaccines become less effective - meaning people begin to develop the disease again. The treatment is the result of the discovery by a team from Southampton University that people with lung diseases such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) often had low levels of interferon beta. ""We thought why not boost patients' interferon beta levels by getting them to inhale the protein,"" Prof Donna Davies, who was part of that team, said. She said research has now shown that Covid-19 can suppress the interferon beta response. But experts warn that drugs often do not live up to the promise of early trials. ""This is exciting, but we have to see what the phase three results show,"" says Dr Lamis Latif, a south London GP who has been working in emergency care with Covid-19 patients. ""We've had other drugs in similar circumstances, we've had hydroxychloroquine, for example, but again, when that reached further trials, it wasn't as promising as it initially made up to be. ""So that's something to really take note for this current drug."" VACCINES:When will you be eligible? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? GLOBAL SPREAD:How many worldwide cases are there?

There's been a lot of coronavirus news around today - here are some of the main headlines: Jordan has launched a Covid-19 vaccination programme intended
to protect more than 20% of the kingdomâs 10 million population. The government has said the first stage will focus on people
over the age of 60, those with chronic illnesses, and medical personnel. It aims
to administer 5,000 shots a day at 29 centres. Health Minister Nazir Obeidattold the state news agency Petra,externalthat the first day had gone âsmoothlyâ. But the head of the ministryâs epidemics and communicable
diseases department, Wael Hayajneh,urged more people to register for the free vaccines,external, with
only 200,000 reportedly signed up since late December. The government has purchased vaccines produced by Pfizer-BioNTech
and China's Sinopharm. The latter was granted an âemergency licenceâ on Saturday. Jordan has seen a sharp fall in the daily number of new
infections since mid-November, when restrictions that
had been eased during the summer were reintroduced. More than 309,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19
and 4,076 deaths have been reported since the start of the pandemic. There's been focus this week on whether people are adhering to the rules around wearing face coverings in shops. Tesco, Asda and Waitrose have becomethe latest supermarkets to say they will deny entry to shoppers who do not wear face masks,  unless they are medically exempt. It follows a similar move by Morrisons, while Sainsbury's says it will challenge those who flout the rules. So what protection do masks offer, what sort can be worn, and what are the rules across the UK? Read our explainer here The education select committee chairman has asked the PM for the roadmap for reopening schools in England. Robert Halfon asked the prime minister about the mental health and social isolation effects on children being away from schools. Boris Johnson says the lockdown measures âhave got to continue to workâ, after showing âsome early signs of progressâ. But he says it was âfar, far too earlyâ to say that would lead to a relaxation next month.

the import of this new variant from Brazil."" The Catholic Archbishop of Glasgow has died after contracting Covid-19 shortly after Christmas. Philip Tartaglia, 70, was one of the most senior figures in the Catholic Church in Scotland. The Church said his cause of death was not yet clear. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she felt ""deep sadness"" to hear of Archbishop Tartaglia's death. She told Scottish Parliament: ""I'm sure that is sadness shared by everybody across this chamber - and to send my deepest condolences to his loved ones and of course everybody in his community."" Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf said he had ""many fond memories"" of conversations he had shared with the archbishop. Philip Tartaglia was born in Glasgow in 1951 and was appointed Archbishop of Glasgow in 2012. He died on 13 January, which is the Feast of St Mungo - the patron saint of Glasgow. More than 9.3 million of Americans have received the first shot of a Covid vaccine The US has been by far the world's worst-hit nation in the pandemic, with Johns Hopkins University reporting late on Tuesday a record 4,470 Covid-related deaths in the past 24 hours. Here are the latest key developments in America on Wednesday:  The US has had more than 22 million confirmed infections since the start of the outbreak, according to Johns Hopkins. The overall Covid-related death toll has now exceeded 380,000, and is closing in fast on the number of American soldiers killed in World War Two, at about 407,000. Doctors' leaders have called for urgent improvements in personal protective equipment for health workers. The British Medical Association isappealing for a higher grade of face maskto guard against coronavirus infection. It says there is 'growing evidence' that the virus is being spread through the air by aerosols. These are tiny virus particles that can build up in stuffy rooms and they have been linked to outbreaks of Covid-19. This follows an open letter from more than 1,500 health professionals for staff on general wards to be given the type of high-quality masks usually only worn in intensive care units. Public Health England (PHE) has issued guidance on what PPE staff in different settings require. It was last updatedin October 2020,external. And you canread our explainer hereon face masks, including what protection they offer, what sort can be worn, and what the rules are across the UK. A highly contagious strain of coronavirus first detected in South Africa has spread to 20 countries, the WHO says The World Health Organisation (WHO) has expressed concern about the spread of new coronavirus variants. A highly infectious strain, which originated in the UK, has now spread to 50 countries and territories, the WHO said. Since the strain was first detected late last year, it has driven a spike in coronavirus infections and deaths linked to the disease in the UK. A strain first identified in South Africa, meanwhile, has spread to 20 other countries, the WHO said. Health experts say both new variants appear to be more transmissible than previous strains but not necessarily any more dangerous. They have also played down the possibility that vaccines will not be as effective against these variants. Still, the increased transmission of these variants is taking its toll. ""Going into a second year of this [pandemic] could even be tougher given some of the transmission dynamics,"" WHO expert Mike Ryan said during an event on social media. There are also concerns about a third new strain the Japanese authorities have identified in four people who are thought to have caught it in Brazil. BBC Radio 5 Live The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has been a major plank of the government's support during the pandemic. Under the furlough scheme, the government pays up to 80% of employees' wages up to Â£2,500. But it has been found to be open to abuse. New figures from HMRC given to BBC Radio 5 Live's Wake Up to Money programme show the department ishandling more than 21,000 reportsof suspected fraudulent use of the furlough scheme, 5,000 of which are under formal investigation. The money is either due to fraudulent claims, or is being paid out in error. The number of tip offs has spiralled sincelast April, from 3,000 to 21,378 reports of suspect payments by early January. HMRC told the BBC: ""This is taxpayers' money and fraudulent claims limit our ability to support people and deprive public services of essential funding."" The DUPâs Ian Paisley has failed to trigger an emergency Commons debate on the discarding of donated kidneys during the coronavirus pandemic. The MP for North Antrim said he had heard some viable organs had been discarded, and called for transplant operations to continue, perhaps using private facilities. Deputy Speaker Eleanor Laing later told him it would be not be allowed, but said a health minister was present and listening to his request. This video can not be played Covid-19: DUP MP says donated kidney discarded in pandemic Lisa SummersBBC Scotland Health Correspondent We heard earlier from Nicola Sturgeon thatrestrictions in Scotland will tightenfrom Saturday. The Scottish government is acting now because of the strain on the health service. Its experts are warning the NHS could beoverwhelmed even under a 'stay at home' scenario,external. We've already seen two health boards postponing all non-urgent surgical procedures as an increase in Covid cases puts growing pressure on the system. The action from NHS Lanarkshire and NHS Ayrshire and Arran is showing how the numbers of Covid patients in hospital is really starting to impact on wider care. Wards that would usually treat people recovering from hip or knee replacements for example may need to be converted into Covid wards. Theatres, usually busy carrying out multiple routine surgeries will become high dependency or intensive care facilities. When staff need to be redeployed to work with Covid patients, it is not safe to carry out other routine work. These are the difficult choices many health boards will face over the coming weeks. Action required now to deal with this health emergency will have consequences later. Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva The event at Wengen is one of the most prestigious at the Ski World Cup Switzerlandâs iconic Lauberhorn ski race has been cancelled because of rising cases of Covid-19, many of them, Swiss health officials say, spread by one British tourist. The resort of Wengen, where the famous race is held, had recorded no cases of the virus until October, and only ten until mid-December. After that, cases began to shoot up, and, worryingly, sequencing revealed many of them were the new highly infectious variant first detected in the UK. Contact tracers found that 27 of the cases alone could be linked to one British tourist who recently stayed in a Wengen hotel. Wengen desperately tried to save the race, offering to close off the resort to everyone but competitors, and even closing its schools. At first Swiss health officials agreed, but when, at the start of this week yet more Covid-19 cases were recorded, they pulled the emergency brake. Wengen is devastated. The Lauberhorn is not just any race, but one of the top competitions on the Ski World Cup circuit. It is dearly loved by the Swiss, who have watched with delight as some of their own home-grown talent - such as Beat Feuz and Carlo Janka - triumphed there. Rachel SchraerBBC Health Reporter As MPs have been mentioning today - a coronavirus variant has been found circulating in the Amazonas state of Brazil, and was picked up in Japan in travellers from the region. Itâs different from the UK and South African variants, but it contains common mutations - two changes to the virusâ ""spike"" in particular which have been flagged as potentially making the virus more infectious. This is not going to be the last mutation we hear about. At the moment changes are mainly being picked up in areas that do lots of genetic tracking of the virus - itâs almost certain there are other mutations already circulating unseen in other parts of the world. And the virus will continue to mutate - itâs just a question of how, how much and how fast. For now thereâs no evidence the virus is becoming more dangerous - but if more people catch it then, left unchecked, more will potentially become ill or die. But the vaccines, which target several different areas of the virusâ spike, should still work - though thatâs something that scientists the world over will be monitoring very closely. There have now been more deaths in the second wave of the pandemic than the first, Public Health England's medical director has said. Dr Yvonne Doyle was reacting to the new record of 1,564 deaths within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus in the UK that have been announced this hour. She said: âWith each passing day, more and more people are tragically losing their lives to this terrible virus, and today we have reported the highest number of deaths on a single day since the pandemic began. ""There have now been more deaths in the second wave than the first. âAbout one-in-three people with Covid-19 donât show symptoms, but can still pass it on to others so it is essential that we stay at home, minimise contact with other people and act as if you have the virus.â Labour's chair of the Home Affairs Committee Yvette Cooper, points out loopholes for travellers arriving home from abroad - including travelling on UK public transport when coming back from a holiday destination. Mr Johnson says there is a ""balanced approach"" from the government on the health of the nation vs the health of the economy. Ms Cooper says other countries brought in negative Covid tests as a requirement to travel ""months ago"" whereas the UK is only bringing these in from Friday. Mr Johnson says 3.5m passengers have been spot-checked since June 2020. He says a ""great deal of work"" goes into checking ""passenger data forms"" to check where people have come from. Ms Cooper says over 90% of those passenger data forms are not being checked. She says these checks ""might as well be voluntary"". Mr Johnson replies that those arriving from abroad are being screened. Ms Cooper asks why people from Brazil are not being checked for Covid, considering that there is a new strain in the South American country which could undermine the UK's vaccination programme. ""We are taking steps to ensure"" that the UK doesn't see the new variant in Brazil coming to the UK, replies Mr Johnson. Caroline Nokes, who chairs Parliament's Women and Equalities Commitee, then asks the PM about access to healthcare during the pandemic. She says the evidence shows it is women who are finding accessing services difficult, referring to a constituent who said her surgery was not currently doing smear tests. Nokes asks the PM what is an acceptable wait for a smear test? The PM says he sympathises with anybody who has had their treatment delayed. ""Sadly, that's what we are seeing. We're seeing delays in cancer, we're seeing delays in smear tests and vital services that people need, and that's a result in the increase in the numbers of Covid patients and that's why we have to work flat out to get the virus under control and reduce the current wave and give people the service we need."" Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Perhaps the most distressing element about the latest Covid deaths is that the numbers are almost certainly going to rise from here. People who are dying now are likely to have been infected around three weeks ago. That was at a point when infection rates were rising quite steeply, so in the coming days and weeks we should, sadly, expect to see more deaths than this. Todayâs figures are affected by the weekend, which sees delays reporting deaths that tend to translate into higher figures from Tuesday onwards. Currently around 800 to 900 people a day on average are dying once you take this into account. But the figures also provide some hope. For the third day, in a row the number of newly diagnosed infections are well below 50,000. There had been several days where they have exceeded 60,000. If that trend continues, and the number of new cases keeps coming down, that will eventually translate into the number of deaths falling. But it is going to take some weeks for that to happen. These are, as many have been saying, the darkest days of the pandemic so far. Caroline Nokes, who chairs Parliament's Women and Equalities Committee, asks the PM what additional protections are being put in place to help victims of domestic abuse who have insecure immigration status. The PM says the government has done ""what we can"" since the start of the pandemic to encourage victims of domestic abuse to come forward, including setting up helplines and investing in independent domestic abuse advisers. He says lockdown rules don't apply to victims of domestic abuse. Nokes follows up by asking why a better job is not being done of explaining lockdown rules to vulnerable people - for example, those who rely on British Sign Language or who might have learning difficulties. The PM says he has been asked a couple of times about sign language in particular, and he is going to ""take that away and see what we can do to increase sign language"". He adds that campaigns the government have produced are available in accessible formats and translations. Â© 2025 BBC.

Reality Check At Prime Ministerâs Questions, Boris Johnson said that âthe lockdown measures we had in place, combined with tier four measures, are starting to show some signs of effect.â Looking at cases of Covid-19 in England, the average for the week ending 1 January was almost 55,000 cases. The week ending 6 January shows a slight dip, to 52,400. These people will have been infected before Englandâs lockdown came in on January 6, although much of the country was under very strict measures before then. So, using publicly available data, it might be too early to make this assessment. And in the past month, weâve seen that a couple of days of decline can quickly be followed by a sustained increase in cases. But what is clear is that hospital admissions from coronavirus appear to be increasing (they usually peak up to a couple of weeks after high numbers of cases). The latest seven day average (ending on January 7) saw 3,705 people admitted to hospital daily in England â thatâs the highest throughout the entire pandemic.  BBC Politics Here's a recap on the main talking points from PMQs: Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle has brought PMQs to a close. Standby for a quick recap.... Labour's Andrew Slaughter says he has received an email from a teacher who says that ""lack of government guidance means her staff will soon be over 100 children - ten times as many as in the first lockdown"". He says ""lockdown in name only may suit the PM"" and accuses Mr Johnson of ""bending the rules himself"". Boris Johnson thanks all schools throughout the country and says that everyone ""wants to see the children of key workers and vulnerable children getting the education they need"". Conservative Andrea Leadsom says the lockdown has been ""awful"" for new parents and seeks reassurance from the PM that the recommendations of her review into early years will form ""a core part"" of his ambition to ""build back better"". Boris Johnson praises her passion for the issue and says he looks forward to working with her ""to achieve the change we want"". Ben Everitt MP In response to a question from Tory Ben Everitt about knife crime in his community, the PM says the government is acting across the board, through introducing knife crime protection orders, getting 6,000 more police officers on the beat and deterring criminals through ""continuous and serious law enforcement"". He adds that those caught with a knife in their possession should get the sentences they deserve. SNP MP Gavin Newlands says British Gas and British Airways' practices of firing and rehiring staff to force new terms and conditions is ""shameful"". He says he has a bill with cross-party support which would outlaw the practice, he asks for a meeting with the PM to discuss it. Mr Johnson says ""there are laws in place to ensure that contractual conditions"" cannot discriminate, but the government is meeting with the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (ACAS) to see what else can be done. Labour's Karl Turner says the government should make use of pharmacies who ""stand willing and able to deliver desperately-needed vaccines"". He accuses the government of ""shunning"" the ""fully-trained technicians"" who work in pharmacies. Boris Johnson says pharmacies do an amazing job but adds that ""we want to ensure we get doses to the places where they are going to get distributed most effectively. ""We need to avoid any wastage at all - that is why we are concentrating on the hospitals and mass vaccination sites."" Labour's Kevin Brennan asks about visas for British musicians to perform in the EU and vice versa, saying it is disappointing that a reciprocal deal has yet to be agreed. He says the issue is fixable but needs leadership from the top. He urges a cross-party approach to sort this out as soon as possible, given the damage he says it will do to the UK's reputation as one of the leading cultural centres in Europe. The PM agrees, saying he expects the EU will want to do more to facilitate easy travel for musicians and other professionals across a range of sectors, saying there is a ""mutual benefit"".  The Lib Dem's deputy leader Daisy Cooper says the vaccination drive in her local area is being hampered because the supply is inconsistent and often arrives at short notice. She asks the PM to ""personally intervene"" to ensure all centres have ""a greater and more consistent"" supply. Boris Johnson says the constraint is not the distribution network but the supply. He says the UK has a bigger supply than most other European countries. DUP MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson says his constituency has ""empty supermarket shelves"" and people cannot get materials or ship things over from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. He asks if the Northern Ireland Protocol can be invoked to help provide direct government intervention to help resolve Northern Ireland shipping problems. Mr Johnson says ""there are teething problems"" but there are no issues holding up goods. He says if the situation worsens then there will be no hesitation in invoking the Protocol to help Northern Ireland. The Northern Ireland Protocol was a key part of the withdrawal agreement the UK and EU agreed in 2019 as part of the UK's divorce from the bloc. You canread a bit more background on the NI Protocol here. We're now on to questions from backbenchers. Tory Julian Sturdy says progress on the vaccination rollout is very encouraging and seeks assurances that it is the PM's ""over-riding priority"" to lift the current nationwide restrictions at the earliest opportunity when current targets are met and ""immunity widens"". The PM promises a ""phased relaxation of controls"" when all the top four categories of most vulnerable groups - that's about 15 million people - have been innoculated. But he says this must be consistent with protecting the NHS and ensuring it is not overwhelmed. Leila NathooBBC political correspondent Pressed earlier by the Labour leader on why current restrictions in England are looser now than they were in March, Boris Johnson said the measures were starting to show signs of some effect and pointed to the damaging effects of lockdown. The PM seems determined to stick to the current framework for now â while still stressing that people must follow the rules.  Mr Blackford says the PM's reply was ""an insult"" to fishermen. He says Scottish seafood exporters are losing ""upwards of Â£1m in sales a day"". He asks the PM if the government will provide compensation to the fishing industry. Boris Johnson says the SNP's policy of an independent Scotland would be ""destructive to the Scottish economy"". He says the party should be focused on fighting the pandemic. The SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford says his constituent is experiencing his ""worst nightmare"". He says his constituent lost Â£40,000 of produce after a lorry-load of seafood was held up by ""Brexit red tape"". ""Where is the sea of opportunity that he and his Scottish Tories promised,"" Mr Blackford asks. Boris Johnson replies that his government is investing Â£100m into the fishing industry. He says the SNP wants to break up the UK under ""a hare brain scheme"" and accuses the party of wanting to ""hand back control of fisheries to Brussels"". Â© 2025 BBC.

"Lockdown winners: Pink prosecco and takeawaysLidl, Just Eat and Asos say demand for fizz, takeaways and clothes all rose during December.Business","More than six million glasses of pink prosecco were enjoyed by Lidl customers over the festive period as strict Covid rules prompted people to indulge. The discount supermarket reported record total sales for the four weeks to 27 December with revenue up 18%. Takeaway firm Just Eat and online fashion retailer Asos have also reported stellar sales for the period. All three benefited as restaurants and non-essential shops faced strict curbs or were forced to close. Demand was so strong, Lidl said it had shifted 7,000 glasses of mulled wine and almost 17,000 deluxe mince pies every hour in the run up to Christmas. Sainsbury's festive boost despite smaller turkeys Champagne puts fizz in Morrisons' Christmas sales It also sold more than 2.7 million servings of panettone, the festive Italian cake. Lidl continued to press ahead with its store expansion programme in the period, opening four new stores in December at a time when many businesses are closing down. Boss Christian HÃ¤rtnagel said: ""Despite this Christmas being a difficult time for many across the country, we are pleased to have been able to help our customers enjoy themselves. ""As we look ahead to this year, we remain committed to our expansion and investment plans,"" he added. Just Eat said delivery orders in the UK surged 58% in the last three months of 2020 compared with the same period last year. The takeaway firm, which operates around the world, said this had been its third consecutive quarter of growth, reflecting the huge demand for takeaway food as restaurants have faced curbs and closures. Boss Jitse Groen said the firm's progress in the UK was ""particularly exciting"" with demand up nearly five-fold in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared with the same period in 2019. Its UK sales force has also doubled compared with last year. It was a similar story for Asos, whose sales for the four months to 31 December rose 36% to Â£554.1m, something it credited in part to restrictions on non-essential shops. Lockdown fashion: 'People are back in pyjamas' The fashion retailer, which also operates across Europe and the US, said its active customer base was now 24.5 million, up 1.1 million on the same period last year. Richard Lim, head of analysts Retail Economics, said: ""Lockdowns, fewer opportunities to mix socially and cancelled Christmas parties have decimated the demand for new outfits this year. ""But what consumers did spend was focused towards casual-wear and channelled online where the retailer was well position to leverage this opportunity.""

The Northern Ireland Protocol was a key part of the withdrawal agreement the UK and EU agreed in 2019 as part of the UK's divorce from the bloc. You canread a bit more background on the NI Protocol here. We're now on to questions from backbenchers. Tory Julian Sturdy says progress on the vaccination rollout is very encouraging and seeks assurances that it is the PM's ""over-riding priority"" to lift the current nationwide restrictions at the earliest opportunity when current targets are met and ""immunity widens"". The PM promises a ""phased relaxation of controls"" when all the top four categories of most vulnerable groups - that's about 15 million people - have been innoculated. But he says this must be consistent with protecting the NHS and ensuring it is not overwhelmed. Leila NathooBBC political correspondent Pressed earlier by the Labour leader on why current restrictions in England are looser now than they were in March, Boris Johnson said the measures were starting to show signs of some effect and pointed to the damaging effects of lockdown. The PM seems determined to stick to the current framework for now â while still stressing that people must follow the rules.  Mr Blackford says the PM's reply was ""an insult"" to fishermen. He says Scottish seafood exporters are losing ""upwards of Â£1m in sales a day"". He asks the PM if the government will provide compensation to the fishing industry. Boris Johnson says the SNP's policy of an independent Scotland would be ""destructive to the Scottish economy"". He says the party should be focused on fighting the pandemic. The SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford says his constituent is experiencing his ""worst nightmare"". He says his constituent lost Â£40,000 of produce after a lorry-load of seafood was held up by ""Brexit red tape"". ""Where is the sea of opportunity that he and his Scottish Tories promised,"" Mr Blackford asks. Boris Johnson replies that his government is investing Â£100m into the fishing industry. He says the SNP wants to break up the UK under ""a hare brain scheme"" and accuses the party of wanting to ""hand back control of fisheries to Brussels"". Â© 2025 BBC.

"We can make this the peak, says Matt HancockThe health secretary urges people to follow rules, saying ""individual decisions"" make a difference.","This video can not be played Matt Hancock: 'Together we can make this the peak' ""We can make this the peak"" of the coronavirus pandemic ""if enough people follow the rules"", Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said. He told BBC Breakfast it was ""those individual decisions"" that determine the virus's spread and it ""comes down to the behaviour of everyone"". People ""shouldn't take the mickey out of the rules,"" he said. Under the national lockdown, people in England must stay at home and only go out for limited reasons. This includes for food shopping, exercise, or work if they cannot do so from home. Similar measures are in place across much of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Latest figures show there are now more than 35,000 people in hospital with Covid - an increase on the spring peak. It comes as Prime Minister Boris Johnson is set to be questioned by MPs on the vaccine rollout later. Meanwhile, Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon is also due to announce whether there will be any changes to lockdown restrictions later. Ministershave been discussingthe possibility of tightening the current restrictions. Can I hug my vaccinated dad? And other questions What is a 'reasonable excuse' for leaving home? Postcode check: Find out the rules where you live Large trial of new Covid treatment begins in UK When asked on BBC Breakfast if this was the peak of this wave of the pandemic, Mr Hancock replied: ""I want it to be, but that comes down to the behaviour of everyone. ""Together we can make this the peak if enough people follow the rules which are incredibly clear."" Mr Hancock said England's lockdown measures were ""always under review"", but he would be ""very reluctant"" to remove the rule of meeting one other person outside for exercise as ""it is a lifeline"" for some people, including those who live alone. Mr Hancock has already ruled out scrapping support bubbles. ""What I'd rather is that everybody follow that rule and doesn't stretch it or flex it,"" he said. On the news that patients at a hospital in London are to be discharged early and sent to a hotel to help free up beds for critically ill coronavirus patients, Mr Hancock said moving patients to hotels ""isn't something we are actively putting in place"". King's College Hospital said it would help to create space for the ""high numbers"" of new admissions and would ""temporarily accommodate mainly homeless patients who are ready to safely leave hospital and will benefit from further support from community partners"". There are very early signs that infections may have peaked - although as always we should be careful about reading too much into a few days' worth of data. The past two days have seen newly diagnosed cases hover around the 46,000-mark. Up to the weekend, the average was close to 60,000. The drop has largely been driven by falls in new cases in London, the South East and East of England. The national picture does mask some regional differences. Cases are rising in the North West, which is causing particular concern. It is too early for the vaccination programme to be having any significant impact so a combination of the national lockdown on top of the tier four restrictions that were imposed in some areas before Christmas look like they may be beginning to have an impact. There is also some evidence the new variant may not be quite as fast-spreading as first feared - a Public Health England study suggested rather than being 70% more transmissible it may actually be somewhere between 30% to 50%. And, if it does represent the start of a continuous fall, it is important to remember it will still take some time to translate into fewer hospital cases - people being admitted at the moment are those who would have caught the virus a week or two ago. But after six weeks of pretty sustained rises, it is at least an encouraging sign. Asked aboutimages of elite footballers celebrating goals with hugs, Mr Hancock said: ""I think elite sport is important because these are tough times, and being able to watch the football on the telly is really important because there's loads of things that you can't do."" He said the Premier League has ""special arrangements to ensure that players are safe"" as well as a testing regime. The health secretary told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the rollout of the coronavirus vaccine will accelerate over the coming weeks, saying they were ""on track"" to deliver it to 14 million people by mid-February. Vaccines deployment minister Nadhim Zahawi later told the Commons' science and technology committee that he was ""confident"" of achieving this target. More than 2.4 million people have now had a first dose of a coronavirus vaccine, while 412,167 people have had a second dose. Mr Hancock said 40% of the 3.4m people over 80 in England had been vaccinated so far. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? YOUR QUESTIONS:We answer your queries GLOBAL SPREAD:How many worldwide cases are there? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters ""We have the capacity to get that vaccine out. The challenge is that we need to get the vaccine in,"" Mr Hancock said. ""What I know is that the supply will increase over the next few weeks and that means the very rapid rate that we are going at at the moment will continue to accelerate over the next couple of weeks."" On Tuesday, NHS Providers chief executive Chris Hopson said it was ""pretty clear"" that because of the new strain the Covid-19 infection rate was not going to go down as quickly as it did during the first wave. ""It now looks like the peak for NHS demand may actually be in February,"" he said.

Brazil data shows China vaccine 50.4% effective,"The Chinese vaccine is one of two that the Brazilian government has lined up A coronavirus vaccine developed by China's Sinovac has been found to be 50.4% effective in Brazilian clinical trials, according to the latest results released by researchers. It shows the vaccine is significantly less effective than previous data suggested - barely over the 50% needed for regulatory approval. The Chinese vaccine is one of two that the Brazilian government has lined up. Brazil has been one of the countries worst affected by Covid-19. Sinovac, a Beijing-based biopharmaceutical company, is behind CoronaVac, an inactivated vaccine. It works by using killed viral particles to expose the body's immune system to the virus without risking a serious disease response. Several countries, including Indonesia, Turkey and Singapore, have placed orders for the vaccine. What do we know about China's Covid-19 vaccines? How do I know the Covid vaccine is safe? Last week researchers at the Butantan Institute, which has been conducting the trials in Brazil, announced that the vaccine had a 78% efficacy against ""mild-to-severe"" Covid-19 cases. But on Tuesday they revealed that calculations for this figure did not include data from a group of ""very mild infections"" among those who received the vaccine that did not require clinical assistance. With the inclusion of this data, the efficacy rate is now 50.4%, said researchers. But Butantan stressed that the vaccine is 78% effective in preventing mild cases that needed treatment and 100% effective in staving off moderate to serious cases. The Sinovac trials have yielded different results across different countries. Last month Turkish researchers said the Sinovac vaccine was 91.25% effective, while Indonesia,which rolled out its mass vaccination programme on Wednesday, said it was 65.3% effective. Both were interim results from late-stage trials. By Philippa Roxby, BBC Health reporter The latest figures for China's coronavirus vaccine show just how difficult it is to compare vaccines. On the face of it, the 50% effectiveness figure isn't as good as Oxford's 70% or Pfizer and Moderna's 95%. But trials are run very differently in different countries - the numbers of volunteers enrolled varies wildly, as do the criteria used to test how much protection the vaccines offer. A figure for efficacy is reached by looking at how many people developed Covid after being given the vaccine, compared with how many were affected when given a dummy injection. Normally, that is based on people developing obvious symptoms but in this Brazilian trial, people with no symptoms also appear to have been included. So it's only when the full data from all trials of this vaccine are published that scientists can analyse its real efficacy, and compare like with like. Only limited data for this Sinovac vaccine is currently available - and experts say that is confusing the picture. In the long term, many vaccines against Covid are needed to vaccinate the world and, inevitably, some will perform better than others - but giving as many people as possible some protection is the priority. There has been concern and criticism that Chinese vaccine trials are not subject to the same scrutiny and levels of transparency as its Western counterparts. Both the Sinovac vaccine and the vaccine developed by Oxford University and pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca have requests for emergency use authorisation pending with regulators in Brazil. This video can not be played From fear to freedom: China's painful year fighting Covid-19 The latest news comes as Brazil is dealing with a major spike in cases. The country currently has the third highest number of Covid-19 cases in the world at over 8.1 million, just behind the US and India. The BBC World Service's Americas editor Candace Piette says the country is suffering one of the world's deadliest outbreaks but as yet, has not announced when its vaccination programme will begin. The delay has been caused in large part by the government's haphazard and divided approach to vaccination, says our correspondent. What do we know about China's Covid-19 vaccines?

Online education 'patchy and inconsistent'Commissioner calls for a clearer approach to home learning while schools are shut to most children.WalesComments,"This video can not be played 'Given the choice, I think they'd rather be back in the classroom', said Nick Langston Online education is ""patchy and inconsistent"" and there should be a clearer national approach, according to Wales' future generations commissioner. Sophie Howe said the Welsh Government should do more to ensure consistency of learning by schools across Wales. Schools areset to remain closeduntil at least the end of January, with teaching delivered remotely. The Welsh Government said it had been commended for the way it had provided devices to access online learning. Ms Howe said ""real leadership from the top"" was needed along with clarity about what parents should expect regarding ""how many hours, what type of work, how we should be using digital platforms, and indeed how best to support parents to facilitate all of that"". She said a chief digital officer for education was needed. ""What we're seeing at the moment is parents having to compete with multiple different platforms. I think I counted about six or seven that my four children are on,"" she said. ""It does seem that some schools are offering face-to-face virtual lessons, some are just offering worksheets and so on."" The Welsh Government said it had successfully providedlaptops and MiFi devices to familieswho were struggling to access online learning, plus guidance and training for teachers. It confirmed there was no legal duty on schools in Wales to deliver a minimum amount of online teaching after schools in England were told it would be mandatory to deliverthree to five hours of remote learningper day - a duty overseen by school inspectors. The Welsh Government said the inspectorate, Estyn, was not formally overseeing the delivery of remote learning in Wales but had been part of a Blended Learning Working Group which also involved regional education consortia and local authorities. Guidance to schools says pupils should generally receive ""the duration of learning time they would receive were they in school"". Lisa and Nick Langston have been helping their children with home schooling Children home-schooling 'denied laptops by schools' Q&A: What are Wales' lockdown rules? Nick Langston, a professional guitarist from Chepstow, Monmouthshire, and his wife Lisa, a solicitor, are helping home school their two young children. Their eight-year-old son is required to complete one piece of literacy and numeracy, and another topic every day which is set online and then sent back to teachers to be marked. Nick said: ""We were concerned initially that we'd be expected to be teaching the kids for six hours a day, which would have been quite a challenge. ""But, actually, the big focus seems to be on making sure the kids' reading and writing keep going, and their numbers keep going, and then they've given us flexibility."" Lisa said the communication from the primary school has been ""fantastic"". She said: ""They respond really quickly which is great because obviously they've got a lot of children to respond to, and they're very positive in their comments and encouraging and pushing the children along. ""There's a real interaction between the kids and the teacher which has been great."" Henry said he's found completing school work from home ""good"" but sometimes ""stressful"" Nick and Lisa's eight-year-old son Henry said he found doing his school work at home ""good"" although it could be ""a bit stressful doing it"". He said he had been completing maths, spelling and work learning about the forest, at home. ""It gets my brain working through the day. ""But it has been a bit annoying because everybody is talking and you have to concentrate to do work,"" he said. Jackson and his younger sister Mari have been learning at home for A-levels and GCSEs Meanwhile 17-year-old A-level student Jackson said the lesson work he is set was ""not that different"" to when he was in school. ""It varies for each lesson, ranging from 15 minutes to the entire hour,"" he said. Rhian Lundigran, head teacher at Glan yr Afon and Bryn Hafod primary schools in Llanrumney, Cardiff, said it is easier to plan for remote learning now schools know they will be closed for some weeks. Having handed out 300 devices and 200 dongles during the first lockdown, a further seven were distributed last week to families whose circumstances had changed. She said a mix of daily ""meets"" with the class teacher, along with setting tasks online, works well. ""We're very aware of children's wellbeing and parents' wellbeing,"" she added. ""We're also aware that teachers have their own children trying to learn at home while they're working at home, and it's trying to get that balance between wellbeing and learning online. ""Every school is different, every family has different circumstances and there are strengths I'm sure in many different schools, but to share that good practice would be really effective and would reduce the workload of teachers."" ""Face-to-face learning is the best way and anything that can replicate that, remotely, needs to be the focus,"" said Plaid education spokesperson Sian Gwenllian The huge challenges of home-schooling BBC's bilingual lessons for home-schooling parents Plaid Cymru said the Welsh Government needed a plan to get rid of a ""postcode lottery"" of provision and the government should provide clear expectations for teachers to address inconsistencies ""from school to school and pupil to pupil"". ""There should be a clearer expectation on schools [and] teachers coming from the Welsh Government that remote learning has to be ramped up. There should be national expectations set out that does include remote learning,"" said education spokesperson Sian Gwenllian. ""Obviously, face-to-face learning is the best way and anything that can replicate that, remotely, needs to be the focus - so live streaming of lessons and individual lessons between smaller groups."" The Welsh Conservatives said the situation had improved since schools were closed in March but the picture was still ""not very consistent"". Estyn boss Meilyr Rowlands: Distance learning provision ""becoming less variable than during the first lockdown"" ""I think there's a case to be made for a minimum number of hours, but without being prescriptive about what those hours are used for because teachers are best placed to know how individual classes would work,"" said the party's education spokesperson Suzy Davies. She said the regional education consortia should have a role in monitoring the quality of provision and ""supervising and supporting teachers"". The schools watchdog Estyn said provision was becoming ""less variable"" than during the first lockdown. Meilyr Rowlands, chief inspector of education, said education staff had risen to the challenges posed by the pandemic. ""The periods of learning from home has meant that all schools have had to think afresh about how pupils learn and how face-to-face teaching can best promote resilience and independent learning skills,"" he said. ""Overall, the education and training system is now better prepared for distance learning and the provision is becoming less variable than during the first lockdown. ""As a result, schools and other providers are planning to implement more extensive programmes of live-streamed and pre-recorded lessons for learners during the current lockdown period."" Most children will be learning from home until at least February half-term, unless there is a big drop in Covid cases Eithne Hughes, director of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) Cymru, said schools were now in a far better position than at the outset of the pandemic to deliver remote teaching. ""We will also be talking to the Welsh Government about how schools can be best supported in order to ensure this provision is of the highest quality,"" she said. ""However, the success or otherwise of remote education is not entirely within their power. ""Some children will not have access to a laptop or tablet, or will have to share access, or will not have a stable internet connection, or a quiet space in their homes.""

"How could Scotland's Covid rules change?The Scottish government is concerned that too many people have not been following the ""stay at home"" rule.ScotlandComments","As Scotland's hospitals fill with Covid patients and the daily-registered death toll passes 5,000, there are concerns the ""stay at home"" message has not had the same impact it did during last year's lockdown. Some of the restrictions announced by Nicola Sturgeon in early January have now been tightened even further. How do Scotland's current lockdown rules compare tothose imposed last March? Lockdown 2020 Last March outdoor exercise was allowed only if people were alone or with someone from the same household. It was initially limited to once a day, before this restriction was eased in May 2020. All exercise had to be done close to home. No mixing with other households or other any outdoor relaxation was allowed. Lockdown 2021 Now up to two people from separate households can meet for outdoor sport or exercise. Children under 12 years old do not count towards this number. There is no limit on how many times you can go out to exercise each day, but you should still stay close to home and avoid crowded areas. Prof Jason Leitch, Scotland's clinical director, says police enforcement is used as ""last resort"" against people who break the rules. These rules are not expected to change in Scotland. However, the UK government has warned that exercise restrictions may be tightened after ""large groups"" have flouted their own two-person rule. Lockdown 2020 Last March non-essential shops were ordered to shut along with cafes, bars, restaurants and cinemas. Supermarkets and pharmacies were among premises which could stay open. In July a new law made it compulsory to wear a face covering in shops across Scotland. Lockdown 2021 All pubs, restaurants and cafes must remain closed in Scotland's level four areas - although they can still serve takeaway food. The definition of ""essential retail"" has also been narrowed, forcing homeware shops and garden centres to close once again. Rules on click and collect will be tightened from 16 January. The service will be limited to retailers selling essential items and access inside premises for collection will not be allowed. Takeaway customers will also no longer be allowed inside premises for pick-up from 16 January. Businesses will have to operate from a serving hatch or doorway. Lockdown 2020 Schools and nurseries wereclosed last March, with First Minister Nicola Sturgeon saying there were too many absent staff to continue. Many teachers prepared homeworking packs and some online learning. Parents and pupils had to get used to home schooling. Children of essential workers and vulnerable pupils were looked after by staff in childcare hubs. Lockdown 2021 Schools began the January 2021 term largely via online and remote learning. As before, only children of key workers and vulnerable children are allowed in classrooms - but this time there is more focus on learning than simply child care. The number of pupils attending school is much higher than last year. Prof Leitch suggests this may be because Scotland has ""too much open"" in the rest of society with working adults in greater need of childcare. He said a ""sweet spot"" needs to be found to keep children and adults safe. The Scottish government hopes pupils can return to the classroom in February, but this plan is to be kept under review. See where coronavirus case rates have been rising in Scotland with thisinteractive map,external. Lockdown 2020 People were told to stay at home except for essential shopping for food or medicine, going out for their daily exercise, or to care for the vulnerable. Employers were asked to make provisions for staff to work from home. Wearing of face coverings on public transport was not initially required, but became mandatory in Scotland in June. Lockdown 2021 It is a legal requirementnot to leave homefor anything other than essential purposes.  A ""reasonable excuse"" can include essential shopping, exercise or caring responsibilities. People should only go out to work if it absolutely cannot be done from home.  It is illegal to travel between Scotland and other parts of the UK unless the journey is essential. There are no expectations of enhanced travel restrictions, as the rules are already ""pretty tight"" says Prof Leitch. ""We have a stay at home law, it is illegal to fly overseas, it is illegal to travel, it is illegal to leave your home without a reason to do so,"" he added. The latestcontact tracing figures,externalfrom Public Health Scotland show that since November, shops have accounted for 19% of the places visited by people the week before their positive test. While these figures don't tell us whether people contracted the virus in a specific location, they do suggest the most likely sources. The number of cases traced to shopping-related locations increased by 83% between 27 December and 3 January. Other large increases were seen when: Visiting friends (328%) Attending private events (177%) People worked in the retail sector (154%) Working in food production and warehouses (148%) Accessing personal care services (125%) In your own home (124%) Lockdown 2020 In March ""essential"" was the key word for all employers. Businesses were told they could only stay open if what they do was ""essential"" to the effort of tackling Covid or the wellbeing of society. Nicola Sturgeon saidbuilding sites should closeunless they involved work on an ""essential building"" such as a hospital. Visits from tradespeople were allowed only for ""essential repairs"". Lockdown 2021 Outdoor workplaces, construction, manufacturing, veterinary services and film and TV production can remain open. Employers have been told to plan for the minimum number of people needed on site to operate safely and effectively. Home visits by tradespeople are still allowed for essential maintenance. This guidance is being put into law from 16 January. Prof Leitch says the Scottish government continues to examine rules around what constitutes essential and non-essential construction.

MSPs will shortly take evidence from teaching unions, the SQA and Education Scotland on education during the pandemic. You can watch the evidence session here on this live page with us from 2.30pm. The Archbishop of Glasgow, Philip Tartaglia, has died suddenly at his home in Glasgow. A spokeswoman for the Catholic Church said that Archbishop Tartagliahad tested positive for Covid-19 shortly after Christmasand was self-isolating at home. The cause of death is not yet clear. Archbishop Tartaglia, who was 70, was ordained a priest in 1975 and served as Archbishop of Glasgow since 2012. The spokeswoman said it would be for Pope Francis to appoint a new archbishop, but until then the Archdiocese will be overseen by an administrator. Changes to Scotland's lockdown restrictions have been announced. The tightening of the rules follows concerns the ""stay at home"" message is not having the same impact it did during last year's lockdown. The changes will come into effect on Saturday and affect:  Click here to find out all the details.  The Scottish Greens' Patrick Harvie asks the first minister about support for those who need to self-isolate. A more proactive approach is needed to help people to do the right thing, Mr Harvie adds. He points out that generally people want to comply with the rules. The first minister says eligibility criteria for support grants has been extended and that outreach services are available through local authorities. ""There is not a suggestion that people are not"" self-isolating, the FM adds. Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie says the full capacity of the gold-standard PCR tests is not being used. Why are we not using the full capacity to find as many cases as possible? Ms Sturgeon says PCR tests are used for testing everyone with symptoms. She says turnaround times are extremely good and it's important that capacity is available when it's needed for those who have symptoms. She says mass testing for those who don't have symptoms is generally most effectively carried out through a different route - using lateral flow tests - which are not as sensitive at detecting the virus. Mr Rennie says the government is great at making announcements about testing but is poor at delivering on them. We should be using the gold standard tests to hunt down the people in our community who have the virus but don't know it. Willie Rennie, Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Richard Leonard says in the past four weeks Scotland has carried out fewer tests per 100,000 than any other nation of the UK. The Scottish Labour leader quotes Mark Woolhouse, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at Edinburgh University, who says ""we are only finding half, or even less than half of the cases. This is like fighting the epidemic with one arm behind our back"". He asks when the community roll out of mass testing will happen The first minister suspects the figures Mr Leonard is using are from the demand-led testing schemes. The numbers are lower in Scotland than the rest of the UK is because the prevalence of the virus is lower here, she explains. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The Scottish government will seek to close a loophole allowing people to do non-essential things during lockdown. Nicola Sturgeon said regulations would be changed, forbidding people from leaving home for an essential purpose and then doing something considered not to be essential after they have left the house. It does mean that if the police challenge you for being out of the house doing something that is not essential, it will not be a defence to say you initially left the house to do something that was essential. Nicola Sturgeon, First Minister The Scottish Conservatives' Ruth Davidson asks if businesses that are affected by today's changes will be given extra financial support, and asks where the evidence is to back up the changes. Ms Sturgeon says an evidence paper is due to be published, but adds that because community prevalence is so high - due to the new variant - all interactions between people have to be minimised. ""There is significant money available, much of it already with businesses and much more of it flowing to businesses over the course of this month,"" the first minister insists. She adds that she will continue to look at what the Scottish government can do ""within its resources"". The first minister told MSPs in Holyrood that statutory guidance would now be introduced urging employers to support workers to remain at home ""wherever possible"". Guidance previously issued to only allow essential work in people's houses will now be placed into law, Ms Sturgeon added. We have already issued guidance to the effect that in Level 4 areas work is only permitted within a private dwelling if it is essential for the upkeep, maintenance and functioning of the household. We will now put this guidance into law, Nicola Sturgeon, First Minister The first minister says today's measures are a ""regrettable but necessary means to an end"". Ms Sturgeon points out that although these are dark and difficult times, there are also grounds for hope. She says there are early signs the lockdown is having an affect so ""we must stick with it"". The first minister says vaccination will protect many more in the weeks and months ahead. She concludes none of us are powerless in the face of this virus as we can behave in a way that reduces the risk of passing it on. ""Please stick to the spirit and not just the letter of these rules."" Interactions should be minimised and in anything we do we should assume we have the virus and follow FACTS. ""At this critical and dangerous moment please Stay Home, Protect the NHS, Save Lives."" The first minister has set out new restrictions designed to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. From Saturday, only shops selling essential items will be allowed to offer click and collect services and customers won't be able to go into takeaway food and drinks venues. Allow Twitter content?

The first minister warns pressure on the NHS is likely to increase further and continue for some time. Ms Sturgeon says last week saw the highest number of registered deaths from Covid since early May. The case numbers must be reduced to relieve pressure on the NHS and save lives, she says . That is why the cabinet is further tightening the lockdown restrictions. The first minister says: ""For now of course we are in a race against the virus. ""To win the race we must complete the vaccination programme as quickly as possible and that is what we will do. ""But we must also slow down the virus."" Ms Sturgeon says the new variant is spreading rapidly making up 60% of new cases and is making it more difficult to get the R number below one without severe restrictions. There are some signs lockdown may be having some affect, appearing to slow down and stabalise new cases. The first minister outlines Scotland's vaccination programme and highlights: Â© 2025 BBC.

How could Scotland's Covid rules change?,"As Scotland's hospitals fill with Covid patients and the daily-registered death toll passes 5,000, there are concerns the ""stay at home"" message has not had the same impact it did during last year's lockdown. Some of the restrictions announced by Nicola Sturgeon in early January have now been tightened even further. How do Scotland's current lockdown rules compare tothose imposed last March? Lockdown 2020 Last March outdoor exercise was allowed only if people were alone or with someone from the same household. It was initially limited to once a day, before this restriction was eased in May 2020. All exercise had to be done close to home. No mixing with other households or other any outdoor relaxation was allowed. Lockdown 2021 Now up to two people from separate households can meet for outdoor sport or exercise. Children under 12 years old do not count towards this number. There is no limit on how many times you can go out to exercise each day, but you should still stay close to home and avoid crowded areas. Prof Jason Leitch, Scotland's clinical director, says police enforcement is used as ""last resort"" against people who break the rules. These rules are not expected to change in Scotland. However, the UK government has warned that exercise restrictions may be tightened after ""large groups"" have flouted their own two-person rule. Lockdown 2020 Last March non-essential shops were ordered to shut along with cafes, bars, restaurants and cinemas. Supermarkets and pharmacies were among premises which could stay open. In July a new law made it compulsory to wear a face covering in shops across Scotland. Lockdown 2021 All pubs, restaurants and cafes must remain closed in Scotland's level four areas - although they can still serve takeaway food. The definition of ""essential retail"" has also been narrowed, forcing homeware shops and garden centres to close once again. Rules on click and collect will be tightened from 16 January. The service will be limited to retailers selling essential items and access inside premises for collection will not be allowed. Takeaway customers will also no longer be allowed inside premises for pick-up from 16 January. Businesses will have to operate from a serving hatch or doorway. Lockdown 2020 Schools and nurseries wereclosed last March, with First Minister Nicola Sturgeon saying there were too many absent staff to continue. Many teachers prepared homeworking packs and some online learning. Parents and pupils had to get used to home schooling. Children of essential workers and vulnerable pupils were looked after by staff in childcare hubs. Lockdown 2021 Schools began the January 2021 term largely via online and remote learning. As before, only children of key workers and vulnerable children are allowed in classrooms - but this time there is more focus on learning than simply child care. The number of pupils attending school is much higher than last year. Prof Leitch suggests this may be because Scotland has ""too much open"" in the rest of society with working adults in greater need of childcare. He said a ""sweet spot"" needs to be found to keep children and adults safe. The Scottish government hopes pupils can return to the classroom in February, but this plan is to be kept under review. See where coronavirus case rates have been rising in Scotland with thisinteractive map,external. Lockdown 2020 People were told to stay at home except for essential shopping for food or medicine, going out for their daily exercise, or to care for the vulnerable. Employers were asked to make provisions for staff to work from home. Wearing of face coverings on public transport was not initially required, but became mandatory in Scotland in June. Lockdown 2021 It is a legal requirementnot to leave homefor anything other than essential purposes.  A ""reasonable excuse"" can include essential shopping, exercise or caring responsibilities. People should only go out to work if it absolutely cannot be done from home.  It is illegal to travel between Scotland and other parts of the UK unless the journey is essential. There are no expectations of enhanced travel restrictions, as the rules are already ""pretty tight"" says Prof Leitch. ""We have a stay at home law, it is illegal to fly overseas, it is illegal to travel, it is illegal to leave your home without a reason to do so,"" he added. The latestcontact tracing figures,externalfrom Public Health Scotland show that since November, shops have accounted for 19% of the places visited by people the week before their positive test. While these figures don't tell us whether people contracted the virus in a specific location, they do suggest the most likely sources. The number of cases traced to shopping-related locations increased by 83% between 27 December and 3 January. Other large increases were seen when: Visiting friends (328%) Attending private events (177%) People worked in the retail sector (154%) Working in food production and warehouses (148%) Accessing personal care services (125%) In your own home (124%) Lockdown 2020 In March ""essential"" was the key word for all employers. Businesses were told they could only stay open if what they do was ""essential"" to the effort of tackling Covid or the wellbeing of society. Nicola Sturgeon saidbuilding sites should closeunless they involved work on an ""essential building"" such as a hospital. Visits from tradespeople were allowed only for ""essential repairs"". Lockdown 2021 Outdoor workplaces, construction, manufacturing, veterinary services and film and TV production can remain open. Employers have been told to plan for the minimum number of people needed on site to operate safely and effectively. Home visits by tradespeople are still allowed for essential maintenance. This guidance is being put into law from 16 January. Prof Leitch says the Scottish government continues to examine rules around what constitutes essential and non-essential construction.

"Mum's 'sadness' at 'mean' free school meal parcelSchools will be able to give vouchers rather than food from next week, the education secretary says.","England and Man Utd footballer Marcus Rashford is a high-profile campaigner for children on free school meals and said the PM had assured him ""he is committed to correcting the issue"" A mother who posted a photo on social media of a food parcel she received has told of the ""sense of sadness"" she felt on seeing what it contained. The mother, who wants to be anonymous, told the BBC: ""As I unpacked that food parcel... and looked at the contents, it felt very sad and depressing."" Chartwells, the firm which supplied the parcel, has apologised. The education secretary said schools will be able to offer vouchers rather than food parcels from next week. Gavin Williamson told the education select committee on Wednesday that he was ""absolutely disgusted"" by the photo of the food parcel's contents, and that his department had made it clear ""this sort of behaviour is just not right [and] will not be tolerated"". He said the government would ""support any school that needs to take action"" and ""name and shame those that are not delivering against the standards"" set by the Department for Education. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer challenged Boris Johnson on online images of the ""disgraceful"" food parcels during Wednesday's Prime Minister's Questions (PMQs). What free school meals are children supposed to get? School food firm apologises after Rashford intervenes The PM insisted the government had ""massively increased the value of what we're providing"" in the form of anotherÂ£170m in the winter grant scheme, Â£220m for holiday activities and food programme, as well as the rollout of the national voucher scheme. He expressed his gratitude to the footballer Marcus Rashford - a high-profile campaigner for children on free school meals who shared images of some parcels online - for highlighting the issue. Speaking to MPs on the Commons Liaison committee on Wednesday afternoon, Mr Johnson said the free school meals pictured online do not reflect government guidance, adding it was a ""scandal and a disgrace that some companies are trying to get away with the provision that they're offering"". The PM added that it was the decision of the schools on whether or not to have vouchers or food parcels, saying that about 75% opt for vouchers but that some schools wish to continue to support caterers. Mr Rashford, who has met with Chartwells andspoke to Mr Johnson earlier,external, called for a ""full major review"" of the free school meal system. In a Twitter thread on Wednesday,,externalMr Rashford said many vulnerable children had been helped during the pandemic ""thanks to the efforts of individuals, businesses, charities, educators, and government"". But he added: ""It's 2021. Our eyes are open. Now is the time for a full major review of the Free School Meal system."" Food parcels have been sent to pupils in England who would normally be eligible for free school meals while schools are closed during the coronavirus lockdown. The national voucher scheme providessupermarket vouchers through an online portal. The government had previously used this scheme duringthe first lockdown. A row broke out after the mother, using the online name Roadside Mum, posted a photo on Twitter of two carrots, two potatoes, a tin of baked beans and a small range of other food items, which she calculated to have cost about Â£5. The post prompted others to complain about the quality and quantity of the food they had received in similar parcels. The mother, who is disabled, had thought it was supposed to last 10 school days and should have been worth Â£30. ""Public funds were charged Â£30. I'd have bought this for Â£5.22,"" said Twitter user Roadside Mum of the parcel she received She told BBC Breakfast: ""As I unpacked that food parcel in my living room and looked at the contents, it felt very sad and very depressing. ""One of my children came in and saw me laying this out on the floor, and I said I was going to picture it because it didn't look like a lot. ""I could see the child's realisation that this is what I've been given to eat for a week and the sense of sadness. ""Where has the rest of the food gone? This is meant to be a week's food. Why is it so mean?"" Lockdown meals teacher restarts deliveries Inside Rashford's campaign to tackle child hunger 'I remember going to bed with hunger pains' Chartwells, the company that provided the parcel, said it was actually only intended to last one school week and had cost Â£10.50 for food, packing and distribution. In a further statement posted on Wednesday,external, the firm, which is owned by Compass group, said it had ""fully investigated"" its food parcels provision in the last few hours. It apologised for those parcels that did not meet the firm's high standards, and committed to refunding the costs. It added that from Monday, the lunches would be enhanced to reflect the Department for Education's additional allowance of Â£3.50 per week per child. The company has since said,externalthat it will add breakfast free of charge into the food parcels from 25 January, and will continue to do so while schools are closed. It will include bread, butter, yoghurts, juice, milk, oats and fruit, it said.

""It's very humiliating,"" one parent toldPolitics Home.,external""Why would you decide for us? Why not give us the money?"" Future Academies, which runs the school, told the BBC it had asked its caterers to improve the quality of its food parcels. Impact Food Group, the suppliers, said the pot contained ""bread mix"" and the only extra ingredient needed was water. The intention was to help parents create ""an interactive cooking experience"" with their children and to help with some food education at home, he said. The academy chain has said its own voucher scheme would start on 18 January. Rachel said she was not 'impressed' with the amount of food in one parcel she received Rachel Rodgers, a mother of three children aged 14, eight, and five, said she was not ""impressed"" with the amount of food provided in a parcel for her youngest child. Rachel, from Essex, says: ""I got so much more with the vouchers. I always looked for meat and vegetables on offer at the supermarket, so I made the vouchers stretch even more. ""What am I supposed to do with one potato?"" Rachel, who receives food parcels for her two youngest children and a voucher for her eldest, says it would have been ""nice to get a little more"" food, adding that ""even sandwich meat would have been good"". One mother said she was 'disappointed' by the food parcel she received for her two children, who are at secondary school One mother of three says she was ""disappointed"" by the contents of food parcels. The mum, who does not want to be identified, says the food box she received for two of her children at secondary school contained sliced frozen bread ""[which] did not stay fresh""; two slices of cheese that [were] ""hard and taste disgusting"", as well as beans, tinned tomatoes, apples, pasta and potatoes. She says her youngest child, who is in primary school, received a parcel of five rolls ""that were going stale"", grated cheese, three packs of crackers, five yoghurts and packs of biscuits. The mother adds: ""It is a good job I already had some cheese and bacon in the fridge, because this is disheartening. ""We have never had support feeding our children through the holidays even when I was young. We need help now."" The initial social media images of food parcels drew widespread criticism. Becca Lyon, head of child poverty campaigns at Save the Children, said the charity welcomed the return of the voucher scheme - adding that theproblems some families had with the vouchers last yearshould not be repeated. Anne Longfield, the children's commissioner, called on companies to provide ""real food and real amounts that will really help families"". Meanwhile, Dr Max Davie, of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said the contents of the food parcels were ""not nutritionally sufficient for children and young people"". Parcels should contain food items rather than pre-prepared meals due to food safety considerations Minimise the fridge and freezer space that schools and families will need to store foods Contain items which parents can use to prepare healthy lunches for their child/children across the week Not rely on parents having additional ingredients at home to prepare meals Not contain items restricted under the school food standards Cater for pupils who require special diets, for example, allergies, vegetarians or religious diets - schools should ensure there are systems in place to avoid cross-contamination Contain appropriate packaging sizes for household use, rather than wholesale sizes Source:Department for Education,external In Wales, the provision of free school meals during the holidays has been extended by a year, and the Northern Ireland Executive made a pledge in November to provide free school meals in holidays until Easter 2022.

'Discriminatory' mental health system overhauled,"Plans have been announced to overhaul the mental health system - with the aim of making it less discriminatory towards black people. Ministers say changes to how people are sectioned in England and Wales will see them treated ""as individuals, with rights, preferences, and expertise"". Black people are over four times more likely to be detained under the Mental Health Act, relative to population. The mental health charity Mind said the changes ""cannot come soon enough."" People are detained under the mental health act - or sectioned - for their own safety, or the safety of others. How long they are detained for varies - but once detained, they are immediately considered to be ""sectioned"". Use of the Mental Health Act has increased markedly - from 2005/6 to 2015/16, the number of people detained in hospital increased by 40%. NHS data for England shows there were at least 50,893 new detentions under the Mental Health Act in 2019/20 - but the overall total will be higher as not all providers submitted data. Of those detentions, 5,336 people were black or black British. The data also shows that in 2019/20 there were 321 detentions per 100,000 population for people who were black or black British - while there were 73 detentions per 100,000 for white people. With the act disproportionately used against black people, the reforms will see a Patient and Carers Race Equality Framework introduced across all NHS mental health trusts - which the government describes as a practical tool to improve the outcome for BAME communities. What ministers call ""culturally appropriate advocates"" will also be developed, so patients from all ethnic backgrounds can be supported. 'I was sectioned and no one told me what was going on' BAME people's mental health 'forgotten about' First lockdown had 'major effect' on mental health ""We need to bring mental health laws into the 21st Century,"" said Health Secretary Matt Hancock. ""I want to ensure our health service works for all, yet the Mental Health Act is now 40 years old. ""This is a significant moment in how we support those with serious mental health issues, which will give people more autonomy over their care and will tackle disparities for all who access services - in particular for people from minority ethnic backgrounds."" The reforms will also ensure that autism or a learning disability cannot be a reason for detaining someone under the act. In future, a clinician will have to identify another psychiatric condition to order their detention. This video can not be played What is it like to be sectioned? The current Mental Health Act dates from 1983 and the aim of these reforms, which are widely supported, is to give people greater say over their care and to rebalance the system between the state and the individual. Among the recommendations are plans to introduce statutory advance choice documents which will allow people to express their preferred treatment before they reach a crisis and need hospitalisation. ""This is just the beginning of what is now a long overdue process,"" said Sophie Corlett, director of external relations at the mental health charity Mind. ""At the moment, thousands of people are still subjected to poor, sometimes appalling, treatment, and manyâ¯will live with the consequences far into the future.â¯ ""Our understandingâ¯ofâ¯mental health has moved onâ¯significantlyâ¯in recentâ¯decadesâ¯but our laws areâ¯rootedâ¯in the 19thâ¯Century."" The recommendations, set out in a government White Paper, build on the proposals from an independent review of the act, which was ordered by then prime minister Theresa May in October 2017 and which published its conclusions in December 2018. Ministers intend to publish a Mental Health Bill in 2022, following a consultation on their plans.

YouTube suspends Donald Trump's channel,"YouTube has become the latest social network to suspend President Trump. The Google-owned service has prevented his account from uploading new videos or live-streaming material for a minimum of seven days, and has said it may extend the period. The firm said the channel had broken its rules over the incitement of violence. The president had posted several videos on Tuesday night, some of which remain online. Google has not provided details of what Mr Trump said in the video it banned, however the BBC has discovered it was a clip from a press conference he had given on Tuesday. The move came hours after civil rights groups had threatened to organise an ads boycott against YouTube. President Trump's YouTube channel remains live but he cannot post new videos Jim Steyer - who previously helped coordinate similar action against Facebook last year - had called on Google to go further and take the president's channel offline. ""We hope they will make it permanent. It is disappointing that it took a Trump-incited attack to get here, but appears that the major platforms are finally beginning to step up,""he tweeted after the suspension,external.YouTube suspends Donald Trump's channel Google said that Mr Trump could still face his page being closed if he falls foul of its three-strikes policy. ""After review, and in light of concerns about the ongoing potential for violence, we removed new content uploaded to Donald J Trump's channel for violating our policies,"" it said in a statement. ""It now has its first strike and is temporarily prevented from uploading new content for a minimum of seven days. ""Given the ongoing concerns about violence, we will also be indefinitely disabling comments on President Trump's channel, as we've done to other channels where there are safety concerns found in the comments section."" Meanwhile, Apple chiefTim Cook told CBS News,externalthat those involved with the riots on the US Capitol last week should be held accountable. ""Everyone that had a part in it needs to be held accountable. I think no one is above the law. We're a rule of law country."" He did not mention President Trump by name, but added: ""I don't think we should let it go. This is something we've got to be serious about."" Mr Trump had already been suspended by Facebook and Instagram following last week's rioting on Capitol Hill, until at least the transition of power to Joe Biden on 20 January. Twitter has gone further by imposing a permanent ban. Amazon's Twitch has also disabled his account on its platform. And Snapchat has locked his account. Shopify, Pinterest, TikTok and Reddit have also taken steps to restrict content associated with the president and his calls for the results of the US election to be challenged. YouTube has often been behind its social media rivals when it comes to moderating user-posted content. Over the years it has come under fire from campaign groups and big advertisers for not acting swiftly. Now it has followed Facebook, Twitter and Snapchat in restricting Donald Trump's access to its platform. And as so often, there's a lack of transparency about exactly what prompted the President's suspension. It's only saying that a video violated its policies on incitement to violence, but is indicating that the issue was the President's remarks to reporters on Tuesday where he refused to take responsibility for the attack on Congress. Of course, those comments were broadcast on TV channels, including the BBC, and are still widely available. It's not long ago that the social media landscape was being described as the Wild West when it came to moderating content - now the platforms suddenly seem eager to appear more cautious than the mainstream media. It's amazing what the threat of regulation can do.

Lidl's pink prosecco a hit in lockdown Christmas,"More than six million glasses of pink prosecco were enjoyed by Lidl customers over the festive period as strict Covid rules prompted people to indulge. The discount supermarket reported record total sales for the four weeks to 27 December with revenue up 18%. Takeaway firm Just Eat and online fashion retailer Asos have also reported stellar sales for the period. All three benefited as restaurants and non-essential shops faced strict curbs or were forced to close. Demand was so strong, Lidl said it had shifted 7,000 glasses of mulled wine and almost 17,000 deluxe mince pies every hour in the run up to Christmas. Sainsbury's festive boost despite smaller turkeys Champagne puts fizz in Morrisons' Christmas sales It also sold more than 2.7 million servings of panettone, the festive Italian cake. Lidl continued to press ahead with its store expansion programme in the period, opening four new stores in December at a time when many businesses are closing down. Boss Christian HÃ¤rtnagel said: ""Despite this Christmas being a difficult time for many across the country, we are pleased to have been able to help our customers enjoy themselves. ""As we look ahead to this year, we remain committed to our expansion and investment plans,"" he added. Just Eat said delivery orders in the UK surged 58% in the last three months of 2020 compared with the same period last year. The takeaway firm, which operates around the world, said this had been its third consecutive quarter of growth, reflecting the huge demand for takeaway food as restaurants have faced curbs and closures. Boss Jitse Groen said the firm's progress in the UK was ""particularly exciting"" with demand up nearly five-fold in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared with the same period in 2019. Its UK sales force has also doubled compared with last year. It was a similar story for Asos, whose sales for the four months to 31 December rose 36% to Â£554.1m, something it credited in part to restrictions on non-essential shops. Lockdown fashion: 'People are back in pyjamas' The fashion retailer, which also operates across Europe and the US, said its active customer base was now 24.5 million, up 1.1 million on the same period last year. Richard Lim, head of analysts Retail Economics, said: ""Lockdowns, fewer opportunities to mix socially and cancelled Christmas parties have decimated the demand for new outfits this year. ""But what consumers did spend was focused towards casual-wear and channelled online where the retailer was well position to leverage this opportunity.""

There's been a lot of coronavirus news around today - here are some of the main headlines: Jordan has launched a Covid-19 vaccination programme intended
to protect more than 20% of the kingdomâs 10 million population. The government has said the first stage will focus on people
over the age of 60, those with chronic illnesses, and medical personnel. It aims
to administer 5,000 shots a day at 29 centres. Health Minister Nazir Obeidattold the state news agency Petra,externalthat the first day had gone âsmoothlyâ. But the head of the ministryâs epidemics and communicable
diseases department, Wael Hayajneh,urged more people to register for the free vaccines,external, with
only 200,000 reportedly signed up since late December. The government has purchased vaccines produced by Pfizer-BioNTech
and China's Sinopharm. The latter was granted an âemergency licenceâ on Saturday. Jordan has seen a sharp fall in the daily number of new
infections since mid-November, when restrictions that
had been eased during the summer were reintroduced. More than 309,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19
and 4,076 deaths have been reported since the start of the pandemic. There's been focus this week on whether people are adhering to the rules around wearing face coverings in shops. Tesco, Asda and Waitrose have becomethe latest supermarkets to say they will deny entry to shoppers who do not wear face masks,  unless they are medically exempt. It follows a similar move by Morrisons, while Sainsbury's says it will challenge those who flout the rules. So what protection do masks offer, what sort can be worn, and what are the rules across the UK? Read our explainer here The education select committee chairman has asked the PM for the roadmap for reopening schools in England. Robert Halfon asked the prime minister about the mental health and social isolation effects on children being away from schools. Boris Johnson says the lockdown measures âhave got to continue to workâ, after showing âsome early signs of progressâ. But he says it was âfar, far too earlyâ to say that would lead to a relaxation next month. This video can not be played Covid-19: Johnson and Halfon on lockdown effect on children Gavin StampBBC political reporter The UK governmentâs Covid O
committee is expected to discuss the new variant of coronavirus that has
emerged in Brazil tomorrow. The prime minister hinted to MPs that there could be restrictions on travel from Brazil to the UK - but a final decision has not been taken. Speaking to MPs he said: ""We are taking steps to ensure that we do not see
the import of this new variant from Brazil."" The Catholic Archbishop of Glasgow has died after contracting Covid-19 shortly after Christmas. Philip Tartaglia, 70, was one of the most senior figures in the Catholic Church in Scotland. The Church said his cause of death was not yet clear. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she felt ""deep sadness"" to hear of Archbishop Tartaglia's death. She told Scottish Parliament: ""I'm sure that is sadness shared by everybody across this chamber - and to send my deepest condolences to his loved ones and of course everybody in his community."" Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf said he had ""many fond memories"" of conversations he had shared with the archbishop. Philip Tartaglia was born in Glasgow in 1951 and was appointed Archbishop of Glasgow in 2012. He died on 13 January, which is the Feast of St Mungo - the patron saint of Glasgow. More than 9.3 million of Americans have received the first shot of a Covid vaccine The US has been by far the world's worst-hit nation in the pandemic, with Johns Hopkins University reporting late on Tuesday a record 4,470 Covid-related deaths in the past 24 hours. Here are the latest key developments in America on Wednesday:  The US has had more than 22 million confirmed infections since the start of the outbreak, according to Johns Hopkins. The overall Covid-related death toll has now exceeded 380,000, and is closing in fast on the number of American soldiers killed in World War Two, at about 407,000. Doctors' leaders have called for urgent improvements in personal protective equipment for health workers. The British Medical Association isappealing for a higher grade of face maskto guard against coronavirus infection. It says there is 'growing evidence' that the virus is being spread through the air by aerosols. These are tiny virus particles that can build up in stuffy rooms and they have been linked to outbreaks of Covid-19. This follows an open letter from more than 1,500 health professionals for staff on general wards to be given the type of high-quality masks usually only worn in intensive care units. Public Health England (PHE) has issued guidance on what PPE staff in different settings require. It was last updatedin October 2020,external. And you canread our explainer hereon face masks, including what protection they offer, what sort can be worn, and what the rules are across the UK. A highly contagious strain of coronavirus first detected in South Africa has spread to 20 countries, the WHO says The World Health Organisation (WHO) has expressed concern about the spread of new coronavirus variants. A highly infectious strain, which originated in the UK, has now spread to 50 countries and territories, the WHO said. Since the strain was first detected late last year, it has driven a spike in coronavirus infections and deaths linked to the disease in the UK. A strain first identified in South Africa, meanwhile, has spread to 20 other countries, the WHO said. Health experts say both new variants appear to be more transmissible than previous strains but not necessarily any more dangerous. They have also played down the possibility that vaccines will not be as effective against these variants. Still, the increased transmission of these variants is taking its toll. ""Going into a second year of this [pandemic] could even be tougher given some of the transmission dynamics,"" WHO expert Mike Ryan said during an event on social media. There are also concerns about a third new strain the Japanese authorities have identified in four people who are thought to have caught it in Brazil. BBC Radio 5 Live The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has been a major plank of the government's support during the pandemic. Under the furlough scheme, the government pays up to 80% of employees' wages up to Â£2,500. But it has been found to be open to abuse. New figures from HMRC given to BBC Radio 5 Live's Wake Up to Money programme show the department ishandling more than 21,000 reportsof suspected fraudulent use of the furlough scheme, 5,000 of which are under formal investigation. The money is either due to fraudulent claims, or is being paid out in error. The number of tip offs has spiralled sincelast April, from 3,000 to 21,378 reports of suspect payments by early January. HMRC told the BBC: ""This is taxpayers' money and fraudulent claims limit our ability to support people and deprive public services of essential funding."" The DUPâs Ian Paisley has failed to trigger an emergency Commons debate on the discarding of donated kidneys during the coronavirus pandemic. The MP for North Antrim said he had heard some viable organs had been discarded, and called for transplant operations to continue, perhaps using private facilities. Deputy Speaker Eleanor Laing later told him it would be not be allowed, but said a health minister was present and listening to his request. This video can not be played Covid-19: DUP MP says donated kidney discarded in pandemic Lisa SummersBBC Scotland Health Correspondent We heard earlier from Nicola Sturgeon thatrestrictions in Scotland will tightenfrom Saturday. The Scottish government is acting now because of the strain on the health service. Its experts are warning the NHS could beoverwhelmed even under a 'stay at home' scenario,external. We've already seen two health boards postponing all non-urgent surgical procedures as an increase in Covid cases puts growing pressure on the system. The action from NHS Lanarkshire and NHS Ayrshire and Arran is showing how the numbers of Covid patients in hospital is really starting to impact on wider care. Wards that would usually treat people recovering from hip or knee replacements for example may need to be converted into Covid wards. Theatres, usually busy carrying out multiple routine surgeries will become high dependency or intensive care facilities. When staff need to be redeployed to work with Covid patients, it is not safe to carry out other routine work. These are the difficult choices many health boards will face over the coming weeks. Action required now to deal with this health emergency will have consequences later. Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva The event at Wengen is one of the most prestigious at the Ski World Cup Switzerlandâs iconic Lauberhorn ski race has been cancelled because of rising cases of Covid-19, many of them, Swiss health officials say, spread by one British tourist. The resort of Wengen, where the famous race is held, had recorded no cases of the virus until October, and only ten until mid-December. After that, cases began to shoot up, and, worryingly, sequencing revealed many of them were the new highly infectious variant first detected in the UK. Contact tracers found that 27 of the cases alone could be linked to one British tourist who recently stayed in a Wengen hotel. Wengen desperately tried to save the race, offering to close off the resort to everyone but competitors, and even closing its schools. At first Swiss health officials agreed, but when, at the start of this week yet more Covid-19 cases were recorded, they pulled the emergency brake. Wengen is devastated. The Lauberhorn is not just any race, but one of the top competitions on the Ski World Cup circuit. It is dearly loved by the Swiss, who have watched with delight as some of their own home-grown talent - such as Beat Feuz and Carlo Janka - triumphed there. Rachel SchraerBBC Health Reporter As MPs have been mentioning today - a coronavirus variant has been found circulating in the Amazonas state of Brazil, and was picked up in Japan in travellers from the region. Itâs different from the UK and South African variants, but it contains common mutations - two changes to the virusâ ""spike"" in particular which have been flagged as potentially making the virus more infectious. This is not going to be the last mutation we hear about. At the moment changes are mainly being picked up in areas that do lots of genetic tracking of the virus - itâs almost certain there are other mutations already circulating unseen in other parts of the world. And the virus will continue to mutate - itâs just a question of how, how much and how fast. For now thereâs no evidence the virus is becoming more dangerous - but if more people catch it then, left unchecked, more will potentially become ill or die. But the vaccines, which target several different areas of the virusâ spike, should still work - though thatâs something that scientists the world over will be monitoring very closely. There have now been more deaths in the second wave of the pandemic than the first, Public Health England's medical director has said. Dr Yvonne Doyle was reacting to the new record of 1,564 deaths within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus in the UK that have been announced this hour. She said: âWith each passing day, more and more people are tragically losing their lives to this terrible virus, and today we have reported the highest number of deaths on a single day since the pandemic began. ""There have now been more deaths in the second wave than the first. âAbout one-in-three people with Covid-19 donât show symptoms, but can still pass it on to others so it is essential that we stay at home, minimise contact with other people and act as if you have the virus.â Labour's chair of the Home Affairs Committee Yvette Cooper, points out loopholes for travellers arriving home from abroad - including travelling on UK public transport when coming back from a holiday destination. Mr Johnson says there is a ""balanced approach"" from the government on the health of the nation vs the health of the economy. Ms Cooper says other countries brought in negative Covid tests as a requirement to travel ""months ago"" whereas the UK is only bringing these in from Friday. Mr Johnson says 3.5m passengers have been spot-checked since June 2020. He says a ""great deal of work"" goes into checking ""passenger data forms"" to check where people have come from. Ms Cooper says over 90% of those passenger data forms are not being checked. She says these checks ""might as well be voluntary"". Mr Johnson replies that those arriving from abroad are being screened. Ms Cooper asks why people from Brazil are not being checked for Covid, considering that there is a new strain in the South American country which could undermine the UK's vaccination programme. ""We are taking steps to ensure"" that the UK doesn't see the new variant in Brazil coming to the UK, replies Mr Johnson. Caroline Nokes, who chairs Parliament's Women and Equalities Commitee, then asks the PM about access to healthcare during the pandemic. She says the evidence shows it is women who are finding accessing services difficult, referring to a constituent who said her surgery was not currently doing smear tests. Nokes asks the PM what is an acceptable wait for a smear test? The PM says he sympathises with anybody who has had their treatment delayed. ""Sadly, that's what we are seeing. We're seeing delays in cancer, we're seeing delays in smear tests and vital services that people need, and that's a result in the increase in the numbers of Covid patients and that's why we have to work flat out to get the virus under control and reduce the current wave and give people the service we need."" Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Perhaps the most distressing element about the latest Covid deaths is that the numbers are almost certainly going to rise from here. People who are dying now are likely to have been infected around three weeks ago. That was at a point when infection rates were rising quite steeply, so in the coming days and weeks we should, sadly, expect to see more deaths than this. Todayâs figures are affected by the weekend, which sees delays reporting deaths that tend to translate into higher figures from Tuesday onwards. Currently around 800 to 900 people a day on average are dying once you take this into account. But the figures also provide some hope. For the third day, in a row the number of newly diagnosed infections are well below 50,000. There had been several days where they have exceeded 60,000. If that trend continues, and the number of new cases keeps coming down, that will eventually translate into the number of deaths falling. But it is going to take some weeks for that to happen. These are, as many have been saying, the darkest days of the pandemic so far. Caroline Nokes, who chairs Parliament's Women and Equalities Committee, asks the PM what additional protections are being put in place to help victims of domestic abuse who have insecure immigration status. The PM says the government has done ""what we can"" since the start of the pandemic to encourage victims of domestic abuse to come forward, including setting up helplines and investing in independent domestic abuse advisers. He says lockdown rules don't apply to victims of domestic abuse. Nokes follows up by asking why a better job is not being done of explaining lockdown rules to vulnerable people - for example, those who rely on British Sign Language or who might have learning difficulties. The PM says he has been asked a couple of times about sign language in particular, and he is going to ""take that away and see what we can do to increase sign language"". He adds that campaigns the government have produced are available in accessible formats and translations. Â© 2025 BBC.

More than 9.3 million of Americans have received the first shot of a Covid vaccine The US has been by far the world's worst-hit nation in the pandemic, with Johns Hopkins University reporting late on Tuesday a record 4,470 Covid-related deaths in the past 24 hours. Here are the latest key developments in America on Wednesday:  The US has had more than 22 million confirmed infections since the start of the outbreak, according to Johns Hopkins. The overall Covid-related death toll has now exceeded 380,000, and is closing in fast on the number of American soldiers killed in World War Two, at about 407,000. Doctors' leaders have called for urgent improvements in personal protective equipment for health workers. The British Medical Association isappealing for a higher grade of face maskto guard against coronavirus infection. It says there is 'growing evidence' that the virus is being spread through the air by aerosols. These are tiny virus particles that can build up in stuffy rooms and they have been linked to outbreaks of Covid-19. This follows an open letter from more than 1,500 health professionals for staff on general wards to be given the type of high-quality masks usually only worn in intensive care units. Public Health England (PHE) has issued guidance on what PPE staff in different settings require. It was last updatedin October 2020,external. And you canread our explainer hereon face masks, including what protection they offer, what sort can be worn, and what the rules are across the UK. A highly contagious strain of coronavirus first detected in South Africa has spread to 20 countries, the WHO says The World Health Organisation (WHO) has expressed concern about the spread of new coronavirus variants. A highly infectious strain, which originated in the UK, has now spread to 50 countries and territories, the WHO said. Since the strain was first detected late last year, it has driven a spike in coronavirus infections and deaths linked to the disease in the UK. A strain first identified in South Africa, meanwhile, has spread to 20 other countries, the WHO said. Health experts say both new variants appear to be more transmissible than previous strains but not necessarily any more dangerous. They have also played down the possibility that vaccines will not be as effective against these variants. Still, the increased transmission of these variants is taking its toll. ""Going into a second year of this [pandemic] could even be tougher given some of the transmission dynamics,"" WHO expert Mike Ryan said during an event on social media. There are also concerns about a third new strain the Japanese authorities have identified in four people who are thought to have caught it in Brazil. BBC Radio 5 Live The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has been a major plank of the government's support during the pandemic. Under the furlough scheme, the government pays up to 80% of employees' wages up to Â£2,500. But it has been found to be open to abuse. New figures from HMRC given to BBC Radio 5 Live's Wake Up to Money programme show the department ishandling more than 21,000 reportsof suspected fraudulent use of the furlough scheme, 5,000 of which are under formal investigation. The money is either due to fraudulent claims, or is being paid out in error. The number of tip offs has spiralled sincelast April, from 3,000 to 21,378 reports of suspect payments by early January. HMRC told the BBC: ""This is taxpayers' money and fraudulent claims limit our ability to support people and deprive public services of essential funding."" The DUPâs Ian Paisley has failed to trigger an emergency Commons debate on the discarding of donated kidneys during the coronavirus pandemic. The MP for North Antrim said he had heard some viable organs had been discarded, and called for transplant operations to continue, perhaps using private facilities. Deputy Speaker Eleanor Laing later told him it would be not be allowed, but said a health minister was present and listening to his request. This video can not be played Covid-19: DUP MP says donated kidney discarded in pandemic Lisa SummersBBC Scotland Health Correspondent We heard earlier from Nicola Sturgeon thatrestrictions in Scotland will tightenfrom Saturday. The Scottish government is acting now because of the strain on the health service. Its experts are warning the NHS could beoverwhelmed even under a 'stay at home' scenario,external. We've already seen two health boards postponing all non-urgent surgical procedures as an increase in Covid cases puts growing pressure on the system. The action from NHS Lanarkshire and NHS Ayrshire and Arran is showing how the numbers of Covid patients in hospital is really starting to impact on wider care. Wards that would usually treat people recovering from hip or knee replacements for example may need to be converted into Covid wards. Theatres, usually busy carrying out multiple routine surgeries will become high dependency or intensive care facilities. When staff need to be redeployed to work with Covid patients, it is not safe to carry out other routine work. These are the difficult choices many health boards will face over the coming weeks. Action required now to deal with this health emergency will have consequences later. Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva The event at Wengen is one of the most prestigious at the Ski World Cup Switzerlandâs iconic Lauberhorn ski race has been cancelled because of rising cases of Covid-19, many of them, Swiss health officials say, spread by one British tourist. The resort of Wengen, where the famous race is held, had recorded no cases of the virus until October, and only ten until mid-December. After that, cases began to shoot up, and, worryingly, sequencing revealed many of them were the new highly infectious variant first detected in the UK. Contact tracers found that 27 of the cases alone could be linked to one British tourist who recently stayed in a Wengen hotel. Wengen desperately tried to save the race, offering to close off the resort to everyone but competitors, and even closing its schools. At first Swiss health officials agreed, but when, at the start of this week yet more Covid-19 cases were recorded, they pulled the emergency brake. Wengen is devastated. The Lauberhorn is not just any race, but one of the top competitions on the Ski World Cup circuit. It is dearly loved by the Swiss, who have watched with delight as some of their own home-grown talent - such as Beat Feuz and Carlo Janka - triumphed there. Rachel SchraerBBC Health Reporter As MPs have been mentioning today - a coronavirus variant has been found circulating in the Amazonas state of Brazil, and was picked up in Japan in travellers from the region. Itâs different from the UK and South African variants, but it contains common mutations - two changes to the virusâ ""spike"" in particular which have been flagged as potentially making the virus more infectious. This is not going to be the last mutation we hear about. At the moment changes are mainly being picked up in areas that do lots of genetic tracking of the virus - itâs almost certain there are other mutations already circulating unseen in other parts of the world. And the virus will continue to mutate - itâs just a question of how, how much and how fast. For now thereâs no evidence the virus is becoming more dangerous - but if more people catch it then, left unchecked, more will potentially become ill or die. But the vaccines, which target several different areas of the virusâ spike, should still work - though thatâs something that scientists the world over will be monitoring very closely. There have now been more deaths in the second wave of the pandemic than the first, Public Health England's medical director has said. Dr Yvonne Doyle was reacting to the new record of 1,564 deaths within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus in the UK that have been announced this hour. She said: âWith each passing day, more and more people are tragically losing their lives to this terrible virus, and today we have reported the highest number of deaths on a single day since the pandemic began. ""There have now been more deaths in the second wave than the first. âAbout one-in-three people with Covid-19 donât show symptoms, but can still pass it on to others so it is essential that we stay at home, minimise contact with other people and act as if you have the virus.â Labour's chair of the Home Affairs Committee Yvette Cooper, points out loopholes for travellers arriving home from abroad - including travelling on UK public transport when coming back from a holiday destination. Mr Johnson says there is a ""balanced approach"" from the government on the health of the nation vs the health of the economy. Ms Cooper says other countries brought in negative Covid tests as a requirement to travel ""months ago"" whereas the UK is only bringing these in from Friday. Mr Johnson says 3.5m passengers have been spot-checked since June 2020. He says a ""great deal of work"" goes into checking ""passenger data forms"" to check where people have come from. Ms Cooper says over 90% of those passenger data forms are not being checked. She says these checks ""might as well be voluntary"". Mr Johnson replies that those arriving from abroad are being screened. Ms Cooper asks why people from Brazil are not being checked for Covid, considering that there is a new strain in the South American country which could undermine the UK's vaccination programme. ""We are taking steps to ensure"" that the UK doesn't see the new variant in Brazil coming to the UK, replies Mr Johnson. Caroline Nokes, who chairs Parliament's Women and Equalities Commitee, then asks the PM about access to healthcare during the pandemic. She says the evidence shows it is women who are finding accessing services difficult, referring to a constituent who said her surgery was not currently doing smear tests. Nokes asks the PM what is an acceptable wait for a smear test? The PM says he sympathises with anybody who has had their treatment delayed. ""Sadly, that's what we are seeing. We're seeing delays in cancer, we're seeing delays in smear tests and vital services that people need, and that's a result in the increase in the numbers of Covid patients and that's why we have to work flat out to get the virus under control and reduce the current wave and give people the service we need."" Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Perhaps the most distressing element about the latest Covid deaths is that the numbers are almost certainly going to rise from here. People who are dying now are likely to have been infected around three weeks ago. That was at a point when infection rates were rising quite steeply, so in the coming days and weeks we should, sadly, expect to see more deaths than this. Todayâs figures are affected by the weekend, which sees delays reporting deaths that tend to translate into higher figures from Tuesday onwards. Currently around 800 to 900 people a day on average are dying once you take this into account. But the figures also provide some hope. For the third day, in a row the number of newly diagnosed infections are well below 50,000. There had been several days where they have exceeded 60,000. If that trend continues, and the number of new cases keeps coming down, that will eventually translate into the number of deaths falling. But it is going to take some weeks for that to happen. These are, as many have been saying, the darkest days of the pandemic so far. Caroline Nokes, who chairs Parliament's Women and Equalities Committee, asks the PM what additional protections are being put in place to help victims of domestic abuse who have insecure immigration status. The PM says the government has done ""what we can"" since the start of the pandemic to encourage victims of domestic abuse to come forward, including setting up helplines and investing in independent domestic abuse advisers. He says lockdown rules don't apply to victims of domestic abuse. Nokes follows up by asking why a better job is not being done of explaining lockdown rules to vulnerable people - for example, those who rely on British Sign Language or who might have learning difficulties. The PM says he has been asked a couple of times about sign language in particular, and he is going to ""take that away and see what we can do to increase sign language"". He adds that campaigns the government have produced are available in accessible formats and translations. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Large trial of new Covid treatment begins in UKIt is hoped the treatment will help stop patients from developing severe illness from the virus.HealthUS executes only woman on federal death rowLisa Montgomery, who killed a pregnant woman and took her baby, died by lethal injection in Indiana.US & Canada","Kaye Flitney is one of those enrolled on the clinical trial A large-scale trial of a new treatment it is hoped will help stop Covid-19 patients from developing severe illness has begun in the UK. The first patient received the treatment at Hull Royal Infirmary on Tuesday afternoon. It involves inhaling a protein called interferon beta which the body produces when it gets a viral infection. The hope is it will stimulate the immune system, priming cells to be ready to fight off viruses. Early findings suggested the treatment cut the odds of a Covid-19 patient in hospital developing severe disease - such as requiring ventilation - by almost 80%. It was developed at Southampton University Hospital and is being produced by the Southampton-based biotech company, Synairgen. A course of treatment with the new drug could cost around Â£2,000, which is not that expensive for a hospital treatment. ""To be viable it will have to represent good value for money,"" Synairgen's chief executive Richard Marsden said. Covid: UK at 'worst point' of pandemic, says Hancock Two more life-saving Covid drugs discovered What drugs can help treat coronavirus? Alexandra Constantin, 34, was the first person to receive the treatment as part of this new trial, after she was admitted to the hospital with coronavirus on Monday. She has a young daughter at home she is desperate to get back to. Demonstrating the treatment, the nurse handed her a nebuliser that makes the drug into a fine mist, which Alexandra inhaled as deep into her lungs as she could. Interferon beta is part of the body's first line of defence against viruses, warning it to expect a viral attack. The coronavirus seems to suppress its production as part of its strategy to evade our immune systems. The new drug is a special formulation of interferon beta delivered directly to the airways via a nebuliser which makes the protein into an aerosol. The idea is that a direct dose of the protein in the lungs will trigger a stronger anti-viral response, even in patients whose immune systems are already weak. Interferon beta is commonly used in the treatment of multiple sclerosis. Previous clinical trials conducted by Synairgen have shown that it can stimulate an immune response and that patients with asthma and other chronic lung conditions can comfortably tolerate the treatment. The results of a smaller, phase two clinical trial of the treatment conducted last year were promising. It suggested the chances of a Covid-19 patient in hospital getting severe disease - requiring ventilation, for example - were reduced by almost 80%. Patients were two to three times more likely to recover to the point where everyday activities were not compromised by their illness, Synairgen claimed. It said the trial also indicated ""very significant"" reductions in breathlessness among patients who received the treatment. In addition, the average time patients spent in hospital is said to have been reduced by a third, for those receiving the new drug - down from an average of nine days to six days. But the trial was small, just 100 patients, and more testing is needed before it can be authorised for use. This new ""phase three"" trial is much larger. It will involve more than 600 patients in 20 countries. As in the earlier trial, half the participants will be given the drug, the other half will get what is known as a placebo - an inactive substance. The team running the trial say they hope it will be completed by early summer. If the results are anywhere near as good as in the earlier trial, they expect authorisation for the drug to be used in patients in the UK and other countries to follow shortly afterwards. This video can not be played Synairgen CEO Richard Marsden explains how the treatment uses the protein interferon beta to help fight the virus ""If we had a positive study, we would hope to move rapidly into scaled manufacture and delivery of the drug in clinical practice,"" said Prof Tom Wilkinson, of the University of Southampton, who is overseeing the trial. He added that he believes the new drug - if it proves effective - will be a complement to the vaccines that are being rolled out. He also pointed out it would take a long time for the whole world to be vaccinated. There will need to be treatments for people who miss out on vaccination or choose not to get the jab. There is also the risk the virus mutates and vaccines become less effective - meaning people begin to develop the disease again. The treatment is the result of the discovery by a team from Southampton University that people with lung diseases such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) often had low levels of interferon beta. ""We thought why not boost patients' interferon beta levels by getting them to inhale the protein,"" Prof Donna Davies, who was part of that team, said. She said research has now shown that Covid-19 can suppress the interferon beta response. But experts warn that drugs often do not live up to the promise of early trials. ""This is exciting, but we have to see what the phase three results show,"" says Dr Lamis Latif, a south London GP who has been working in emergency care with Covid-19 patients. ""We've had other drugs in similar circumstances, we've had hydroxychloroquine, for example, but again, when that reached further trials, it wasn't as promising as it initially made up to be. ""So that's something to really take note for this current drug."" VACCINES:When will you be eligible? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? GLOBAL SPREAD:How many worldwide cases are there?

"US executes only woman on federal death rowLisa Montgomery, who killed a pregnant woman and took her baby, died by lethal injection in Indiana.US & Canada","Lisa Montgomery was sentenced to death in 2007 Lisa Montgomery - the only female inmate on federal death row in the US - has been executed for murder. She received a lethal injection at a prison in Terre Haute, Indiana, after a last-minute stay of execution was lifted by the US Supreme Court. The case attracted attention because her lawyers argued she was mentally ill and suffered serious abuse as a child. The 52-year-old strangled a pregnant woman before cutting out and kidnapping her baby in Missouri in 2004. Her victim, 23-year-old Bobbie Jo Stinnett, bled to death but her baby was safely recovered and returned to her family. Montgomery is the first female federal inmate to be put to death by the US government in 67 years. According to witnesses, a woman standing next to Montgomery during the execution process, removed the inmate's face mask and asked her if she had any last words. Montgomery responded ""no"", and said nothing else. She was pronounced dead at 01:31 (06:31 GMT). Montgomery's lawyer, Kelley Henry, said that everyone who had participated in the execution ""should feel shame"". ""The government stopped at nothing in its zeal to kill this damaged and delusional woman,"" she said in a statement. ""Lisa Montgomery's execution was far from justice."" Protesters demanding an end to the death penalty gathered outside the prison in Terre Haute, Indiana The latest execution was postponed twice - first by Covid-19, then by a judge - until a Supreme Court ruling cleared the way for it to take place in the early hours of Wednesday. In adramatic move late on Monday, a judge in Indiana had halted the scheduled injection until a mental competency hearing could be held. Her lawyers argued that she had been born brain-damaged and was too mentally ill to be executed. As a child she was routinely sexually and physically abused by her father and trafficked by her mother, family members said. Her treatment was so violent that it amounted to torture, her lawyers say. Her defence team believe that at the time of her crime, Montgomery was psychotic and out of touch with reality. That opinion is supported by 41 current and former lawyers as well as human rights groups like the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. But her victim's family and friends say the murder committed by Montgomery was so horrific that she deserved to be put to death regardless of her mental health. Lisa Montgomery: Looking for answers in the life of a killer In Trump's final days, a rush of federal executions US government death penalty move draws sharp criticism She killed 23-year-old Stinnett in Skidmore, Missouri, after befriending the pregnant woman online over a shared love of dogs. After driving to Stinnett's house, Montgomery overpowered the pregnant woman, strangled her with a piece of rope, and cut the baby out of her womb. Police found Montgomery cradling a new-born girl she claimed to have given birth to the day before. After her story fell apart, she confessed to the killing. She was found guilty of the crime in 2007. The next day, she was sentenced to death. Analysis by Jessica Lussenhop, BBC News, Washington The fight to save the life of a death row inmate is always dramatic up until the very last moment, and none more so than the fight to save Lisa Montgomery. Although only President Trump had the power to grant her clemency and commute her sentence to life in prison, if her lawyers were able to delay her execution until after President-elect Biden takes office, they would have effectively achieved the same thing. Biden has pledged to end the death penalty on the federal level. And so it all ended - as many death penalty cases do - in an 11th hour flurry of legal filings that pitted Montgomery's legal team against lawyers for the Department of Justice, who were urging the execution forward. Ultimately, the US Supreme Court ruled against Montgomery in all three of her final legal challenges, including one that argued that it would be unconstitutional to execute Montgomery because she is not mentally competent. Since 2008, Montgomery had been held in a federal prison in Texas for female inmates with special needs, where she has been receiving psychiatric care. Since receiving her execution date, she'd been placed on suicide watch in an isolated cell. Montgomery's lawyer, Ms Henry, said her original legal defence was woefully inadequate, and presented few of the details about her abuse, trauma and mental illness. The Supreme Court outlawed the death penalty at state and federal level in 1972 but reversed the decision four years later. Since 1976, 16 women other than Lisa Montgomery have been executed but all by individual states rather than by the government. Before Montgomery's execution, the last woman to be executed by the US government was Bonnie Heady, who died in a gas chamber in Missouri in 1953, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. Federal executions had been on pause for 17 years before President Donald Trump ordered them to resume earlier last year.

Vaccine goal 'achievable' but hinges on supply,"More than 100,000 Covid-19 vaccinations had been issued in Northern Ireland by Tuesday evening, Robin Swann has said. The health minister said, of that figure, 91,419 people had received their first vaccine dose. He added that 95% of care home residents had received their first dose and about 20% of those aged over 80 have received their first dose. It comes as leading GP said the goal to begin a mass vaccine rollout by summer is ""achievable"" but hinges on supply. The Department of Health published itsplan to deliver vaccines in Northern Ireland on Tuesday. Dr Alan Stout said thetimelinewas ""very sensible"" but was ""almost 100%"" dependent on getting enough of the vaccine. At Wednesday's health briefing, Mr Swann said the programme had made a ""strong start"" but there was more to do. He also said he has decided to issue tighter visiting guidelines for hospitals. Health Minister gives Covid briefing ""I have ensured visiting will be permitted to hospices and care homes, but visits to general medical wards will no longer be permitted from this Friday"", he said. The minister added that the measure would be kept under constant review. Mr Swann also confirmed a new rapid test for Covid-19, which can return results in 12 minutes, would be used in emergency departments. He said a pilot programme has been carried out using the LumiraDX nasal swab, which will enable health staff to ""very quickly identify patients who do not have Covid-19"". Mr Swann at Wednesday's briefing He also repeated that the current lockdown restrictions were working and had helped to reduce NI's rate of infection, but warned the executive would still have ""difficult decisions"" to take in relation to decisions about whether to extend some restrictions in the coming weeks. On Wednesday, a further 19 Covid-related deaths were announced by the Department of Health in Northern Ireland. A further 1,145 new cases of the virus were also reported. Meanwhile, Northern Ireland's chief medical officer warned there was ""no doubt"" that levels of the new, more transmissible variant of coronavirus are rising in Northern Ireland. Speaking at Stormont's executive briefing, Dr Michael McBride said that the new variant was making the job to contain it ""twice as difficult"". The new variant is said to be up to 70% more transmissible, but there is no evidence it is more dangerous. Thefirst confirmed case of the new strain was detected in Northern Ireland on 23 December, but officials had said levels in Northern Ireland remained lower than in other areas of the UK. Dr McBride said there would now be situations where the variant could spread, where previously it may not have. ""We need to be extremely cautious in the weeks ahead,"" he warned, adding that the virus would not ""magically disappear"" on 6 February, when the current lockdown is due to end. Stormont ministers have to review the regulations on or before 22 January, with that scheduled for next Thursday. Dr McBride said Northern Ireland had some distance to go before restrictions are lifted Dr Stout, the chair of NI's GP committee, said practices needed another 22,000 doses to finish vaccinating people aged over 80. Speaking to BBC's Good Morning Ulster, he said he was ""very confident"" the next doses would come through shortly. NI Covid-19 restrictions: Your questions answered What is Northern Ireland's Covid-19 vaccine plan? Health chiefs reveal vaccine timeline in NI ""I have been overwhelmed by the desire of practices, the determination just to get going and the one thing we need to give them is vaccine - we need to get the supply in as quickly as possible. ""This is such a good news story that everybody wants the vaccine and everybody wants to give it."" The plan is for the vaccine to be given to the general population in summer 2021. GP clinics should have received their first delivery of the vaccine by Tuesday. Responding to reports in The Daily Telegraph thatGPs administering the vaccine in England had been asked to ""slow down"" to let other regions ""catch-up"",external, Dr Stout said Northern Ireland had taken a different approach to how it rolled out vaccines to GPs. He said vaccines were shared among all practices in Northern Ireland. ""We just don't have the full amount of vaccine in practice to give. We could have given all of the vaccine that a certain number of practices needed to start with but there were issues with inequality and discrimination ... so that's why an amount has gone to every single practice, so at least they have some.""

NI R-rate drop shows 'public doing right thing',"Michelle O'Neill and Arlene Foster appeared at their first joint press conference in weeks A fall in Northern Ireland's rate of Covid-19 infection has been achieved by many people ""doing the right thing"", Arlene Foster has said. But she said she was concerned by reports of some employers not adhering to the ""stay-at-home"" order for staff. Earlier, ministers also discussed a potential crackdown on larger retailers selling non-essential items. The first minister said that was a ""selfish spirit"" which would not help beat the virus. Stormont's first and deputy first ministers were appearing in Dungannon, County Tyrone, at their first joint press conference in more than a month. NI Covid-19 restrictions: Your questions answered What is Northern Ireland's Covid-19 vaccine plan? Their comments came as a further 1,205 cases of the virus were reported by Northern Ireland's Department of Health on Tuesday. Twenty-two more people have died with the virus, taking the department's total number of deaths to 1,498. There are 785 people in hospital with Covid-19, 55 are in intensive care. The reproductive rate of the virus - known as the R rate, measures the infection rate of Covid-19 and had risen to about 1.8 due to Christmas relaxations. But it has now fallen ""significantly"", according to the Chief Scientific Adviser Prof Ian Young. The first and deputy first ministers will meet the PSNI Chief Constable Simon Byrne on Tuesday evening to discuss enforcement of the coronavirus laws. Michelle O'Neill, NI's Deputy First Minister, said there would also be an ""urgent roundtable"" with the retail sector to reinforce the need to ""comply with the spirit and letter"" of the restrictions. ""Adherence will get us through this difficult period,"" said Ms O'Neill. Northern Ireland is in the third week of a six-week lockdown, with many sectors forced to close. People havealso been told they should only leave homefor exercise, food and medical needs or if they cannot work from home. Mrs Foster said the evidence provided to ministers showed that the restrictions were working, and she paid tribute to the public for complying. ""It's people choosing to Facetime and phone friends rather than visiting, it's doing one big shop and not nipping out every day, doing the best job you can at home and not going into the work place when you don't have to,"" she added. Dr McBride said Northern Ireland had some distance to go before restrictions are lifted Meanwhile, Northern Ireland's chief medical officer warned that there are ""some hard yards to go"" and lockdown would not be ending soon. ""I'm not certain we will be emerging from lockdown in February. I think that would be optimistic in the extreme,"" said Dr Michael McBride. ""We have a long, long way to go with this virus. I don't think any of us can anticipate a return to normality come the 6th of February."" Mr McBride said restrictions would be in place for a considerable number of months, until a time when more of the population who are extremely clinically vulnerable are vaccinated. Earlier, Prof Young said Northern Ireland had passed the peak in terms of new cases of Covid-19 for this wave of the pandemic. But he warned: ""We still have a long way to go and the number of cases we are seeing each day is still averaging well over 1,000 cases a day - which by any measure in the course of the epidemic represents a very high level."" He said he expects the number of hospital inpatients to continue to rise ""until some time in last two weeks in January"". Prof Young said he believed that the current restrictions are ""sufficient"" for the moment, if people stick to them. Health bosses say hospitals are facing major pressure due to the high number of Covid-19 cases Northern Ireland's chief medical officer Dr Michael McBride said it was estimated that on average about one in 60 people have Covid-19 in Northern Ireland. He said the rising number of cases was a ""payback"" for the relaxation of restrictions in December. New lockdown restrictions came into force in Northern Ireland on Friday 8 January,meaning people can only leave their home for essential reasons. Prof Young said while compliance with the stay-at-home order was better than it was at the start of December, it was still not as good as it was in the first lockdown in March. Police have set up checkpoints with officers questioning people about whether their travel is essential Amid the pressure on the health service, health trusts have said more cancer operations could be cancelled. The Belfast Health Trust has already cancelled urgent cancer surgeries. Father James O'Reilly, a chaplain at Antrim Area Hospital, said he has been called to the hospital almost every day in the past year to give Covid-19 patients their last rites and to provide comfort to families and staff. Speaking to BBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster programme he said: ""You can see the toll it's taking on the nurses and doctors now. Tens of thousands of Covid-19 vaccines have been given to people in Northern Ireland ""They are giving everything and quite honestly they don't have much more to give it seems. ""That's a scary thought because they're our last line of defence against this disease."" As of Monday evening, almost 92,000 people in Northern Irelandhad received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine. Dr Frances O'Hagan, whose clinic in Armagh city began vaccinating people aged over 80 last week, expects to have administered the jab to more than 300 patients by the end of the week.

Fresh calls for NI mother and baby homes inquiry,"Amnesty says about 7,500 women and girls gave birth in the Northern Ireland homes, There have been calls for an inquiry into mother and baby homes in Northern Ireland. It comes asthe Irish government is to apologise after an investigation found an ""appalling level of infant mortality"" in the Republic of Ireland's homes. About 9,000 children died in the 18 institutions under investigation. Mothers and babies who were in similar homes in Northern Ireland want a full inquiry to be held in NI too. Stormont commissioned research into whether or not there should an inquiry held into the homes which operated in Northern Ireland, is due to be published by the end of January. Patrick Corrigan from Amnesty International said the issue of forced adoptions also needs close scrutiny. ""We have had cases of mothers telling us that ultimately, many decades later, when they tried to track down their long-lost children they found adoption certificates where they said their signature had actually been forged,"" he said. ""So I think that there is criminality to investigate here and that it behoves the Northern Ireland Executive to set up the inquiry that has long been sought here and long been denied."" In 2017 research intoinfant mortality rates at former mother and baby homes in Northern Ireland had prompted initial calls for a public inquiry. Irish PM to apologise over mother-and-baby homes 'I need to know what happened to my brothers' Call for NI mother and baby homes inquiry BBC News NI previously spoke toEunan Duffy who was 47 years old when he found out he was adopted from Marianvale mother and baby home in Newry, County Down. It was one of a network of institutions in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland which offered women the voluntary option, for those who were unmarried, to give birth in private and give their babies up for adoption This video can not be played Marian Vale was one of a network of mother and baby institutions in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland Amnesty says there were more than a dozen mother-and-baby institutions in Northern Ireland. It said about 7,500 women and girls gave birth in the Northern Ireland homes, operated by both Catholic and Protestant churches and religious organisations. In Northern Ireland, research into mother and baby homes and Magdalene laundries was commissioned three years ago and was initially expected to take 12 months. It was completed in February last year, but was then sent to those facing criticism to give them an opportunity to reply. A Department of Health spokesperson said: ""A paper will be brought to the executive shortly for its consideration. Subject to executive approval, it is intended to publish the research report before the end of January 2021."" In the Republic of Ireland, the commission that investigated the homes found that the number of children who died was about 15% of all those who were born in the institutions. Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) MÃ­cheÃ¡l Martin said the report, which can be read in fullhere,external, described a ""dark, difficult and shameful chapter"" of Irish history. Solicitor Claire McKeegan, who represents the Birth Mothers for Justice group, welcomed the apology in the Republic of Ireland, but said mothers and children in NI had not received one. ""The crimes perpetrated on them have yet to be investigated,"" she said. ""Those perpetrators who forced them into arbitrary detention, hard labour and colluded in the forced adoption of their babies, remain unchallenged in this jurisdiction."" Mary O'Neill became pregnant when she was 18 and was sent to Marianvale in Newry in the late 1970s. There she gave birth to a baby girl who was taken away from her almost immediately after the birth. She wanted to keep the baby, but was not allowed and was told the baby would be put up for adoption. The mother and baby scandal became an international news story when 'significant human remains' were found on the grounds of a former home in County Galway Ms O'Neill told Good Morning Ulster she eventually tracked down her daughter after 40 years. ""It was a long search, everywhere you went you were up against a brick wall,"" she said. ""There was no help, the social workers didn't want to tell you anything."" She finally found out her daughter was living in America but was coming home for her 40th birthday. She said when she met her it was like meeting a stranger. ""But thank God we have met and we have a good relationship. She's still keeping in touch,"" Ms O'Neill said. ""It means the world to me, because you always wondered where was she? Was she happy? Did she know about you? ""It was always in the back of your mind. It never went away, the tears and the heartache."" This video can not be played Taoiseach  MicheÃ¡l Martin: ""We treated women and children exceptionally badly"" Ms O'Neill said she was happy the victims in the Republic of Ireland were getting an apology, but wishes the homes in Northern Ireland could have been included. Mechelle Dillon's mother was 21 and pregnant when she was sent to Marianvale in Newry in 1969. She was placed in foster care a few months after her birth. Her mother returned to her home village and then moved to England. But she came back for Mechelle when she was around eight or nine-months-old. She said she believed she was not adopted because she was born with a cyst on her mouth. ""I would have maybe been classed as a reject, if you want to put it that way,"" she said. ""It's the same as if you go to look for a little puppy and if the puppy doesn't feel right and you think 'Oh God, I'll have a lot of vet bills here, I don't want that puppy' - I would have probably been classed the same because I would have had that defect."" SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said ""the executive should move quickly to publish the research report and then call a full public inquiry"".

There's been a lot of coronavirus news around today - here are some of the main headlines: Jordan has launched a Covid-19 vaccination programme intended
to protect more than 20% of the kingdomâs 10 million population. The government has said the first stage will focus on people
over the age of 60, those with chronic illnesses, and medical personnel. It aims
to administer 5,000 shots a day at 29 centres. Health Minister Nazir Obeidattold the state news agency Petra,externalthat the first day had gone âsmoothlyâ. But the head of the ministryâs epidemics and communicable
diseases department, Wael Hayajneh,urged more people to register for the free vaccines,external, with
only 200,000 reportedly signed up since late December. The government has purchased vaccines produced by Pfizer-BioNTech
and China's Sinopharm. The latter was granted an âemergency licenceâ on Saturday. Jordan has seen a sharp fall in the daily number of new
infections since mid-November, when restrictions that
had been eased during the summer were reintroduced. More than 309,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19
and 4,076 deaths have been reported since the start of the pandemic. There's been focus this week on whether people are adhering to the rules around wearing face coverings in shops. Tesco, Asda and Waitrose have becomethe latest supermarkets to say they will deny entry to shoppers who do not wear face masks,  unless they are medically exempt. It follows a similar move by Morrisons, while Sainsbury's says it will challenge those who flout the rules. So what protection do masks offer, what sort can be worn, and what are the rules across the UK? Read our explainer here The education select committee chairman has asked the PM for the roadmap for reopening schools in England. Robert Halfon asked the prime minister about the mental health and social isolation effects on children being away from schools. Boris Johnson says the lockdown measures âhave got to continue to workâ, after showing âsome early signs of progressâ. But he says it was âfar, far too earlyâ to say that would lead to a relaxation next month. This video can not be played Covid-19: Johnson and Halfon on lockdown effect on children Gavin StampBBC political reporter The UK governmentâs Covid O
committee is expected to discuss the new variant of coronavirus that has
emerged in Brazil tomorrow. The prime minister hinted to MPs that there could be restrictions on travel from Brazil to the UK - but a final decision has not been taken. Speaking to MPs he said: ""We are taking steps to ensure that we do not see
the import of this new variant from Brazil."" The Catholic Archbishop of Glasgow has died after contracting Covid-19 shortly after Christmas. Philip Tartaglia, 70, was one of the most senior figures in the Catholic Church in Scotland. The Church said his cause of death was not yet clear. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she felt ""deep sadness"" to hear of Archbishop Tartaglia's death. She told Scottish Parliament: ""I'm sure that is sadness shared by everybody across this chamber - and to send my deepest condolences to his loved ones and of course everybody in his community."" Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf said he had ""many fond memories"" of conversations he had shared with the archbishop. Philip Tartaglia was born in Glasgow in 1951 and was appointed Archbishop of Glasgow in 2012. He died on 13 January, which is the Feast of St Mungo - the patron saint of Glasgow. More than 9.3 million of Americans have received the first shot of a Covid vaccine The US has been by far the world's worst-hit nation in the pandemic, with Johns Hopkins University reporting late on Tuesday a record 4,470 Covid-related deaths in the past 24 hours. Here are the latest key developments in America on Wednesday:  The US has had more than 22 million confirmed infections since the start of the outbreak, according to Johns Hopkins. The overall Covid-related death toll has now exceeded 380,000, and is closing in fast on the number of American soldiers killed in World War Two, at about 407,000. Doctors' leaders have called for urgent improvements in personal protective equipment for health workers. The British Medical Association isappealing for a higher grade of face maskto guard against coronavirus infection. It says there is 'growing evidence' that the virus is being spread through the air by aerosols. These are tiny virus particles that can build up in stuffy rooms and they have been linked to outbreaks of Covid-19. This follows an open letter from more than 1,500 health professionals for staff on general wards to be given the type of high-quality masks usually only worn in intensive care units. Public Health England (PHE) has issued guidance on what PPE staff in different settings require. It was last updatedin October 2020,external. And you canread our explainer hereon face masks, including what protection they offer, what sort can be worn, and what the rules are across the UK. A highly contagious strain of coronavirus first detected in South Africa has spread to 20 countries, the WHO says The World Health Organisation (WHO) has expressed concern about the spread of new coronavirus variants. A highly infectious strain, which originated in the UK, has now spread to 50 countries and territories, the WHO said. Since the strain was first detected late last year, it has driven a spike in coronavirus infections and deaths linked to the disease in the UK. A strain first identified in South Africa, meanwhile, has spread to 20 other countries, the WHO said. Health experts say both new variants appear to be more transmissible than previous strains but not necessarily any more dangerous. They have also played down the possibility that vaccines will not be as effective against these variants. Still, the increased transmission of these variants is taking its toll. ""Going into a second year of this [pandemic] could even be tougher given some of the transmission dynamics,"" WHO expert Mike Ryan said during an event on social media. There are also concerns about a third new strain the Japanese authorities have identified in four people who are thought to have caught it in Brazil. BBC Radio 5 Live The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has been a major plank of the government's support during the pandemic. Under the furlough scheme, the government pays up to 80% of employees' wages up to Â£2,500. But it has been found to be open to abuse. New figures from HMRC given to BBC Radio 5 Live's Wake Up to Money programme show the department ishandling more than 21,000 reportsof suspected fraudulent use of the furlough scheme, 5,000 of which are under formal investigation. The money is either due to fraudulent claims, or is being paid out in error. The number of tip offs has spiralled sincelast April, from 3,000 to 21,378 reports of suspect payments by early January. HMRC told the BBC: ""This is taxpayers' money and fraudulent claims limit our ability to support people and deprive public services of essential funding."" The DUPâs Ian Paisley has failed to trigger an emergency Commons debate on the discarding of donated kidneys during the coronavirus pandemic. The MP for North Antrim said he had heard some viable organs had been discarded, and called for transplant operations to continue, perhaps using private facilities. Deputy Speaker Eleanor Laing later told him it would be not be allowed, but said a health minister was present and listening to his request. This video can not be played Covid-19: DUP MP says donated kidney discarded in pandemic Lisa SummersBBC Scotland Health Correspondent We heard earlier from Nicola Sturgeon thatrestrictions in Scotland will tightenfrom Saturday. The Scottish government is acting now because of the strain on the health service. Its experts are warning the NHS could beoverwhelmed even under a 'stay at home' scenario,external. We've already seen two health boards postponing all non-urgent surgical procedures as an increase in Covid cases puts growing pressure on the system. The action from NHS Lanarkshire and NHS Ayrshire and Arran is showing how the numbers of Covid patients in hospital is really starting to impact on wider care. Wards that would usually treat people recovering from hip or knee replacements for example may need to be converted into Covid wards. Theatres, usually busy carrying out multiple routine surgeries will become high dependency or intensive care facilities. When staff need to be redeployed to work with Covid patients, it is not safe to carry out other routine work. These are the difficult choices many health boards will face over the coming weeks. Action required now to deal with this health emergency will have consequences later. Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva The event at Wengen is one of the most prestigious at the Ski World Cup Switzerlandâs iconic Lauberhorn ski race has been cancelled because of rising cases of Covid-19, many of them, Swiss health officials say, spread by one British tourist. The resort of Wengen, where the famous race is held, had recorded no cases of the virus until October, and only ten until mid-December. After that, cases began to shoot up, and, worryingly, sequencing revealed many of them were the new highly infectious variant first detected in the UK. Contact tracers found that 27 of the cases alone could be linked to one British tourist who recently stayed in a Wengen hotel. Wengen desperately tried to save the race, offering to close off the resort to everyone but competitors, and even closing its schools. At first Swiss health officials agreed, but when, at the start of this week yet more Covid-19 cases were recorded, they pulled the emergency brake. Wengen is devastated. The Lauberhorn is not just any race, but one of the top competitions on the Ski World Cup circuit. It is dearly loved by the Swiss, who have watched with delight as some of their own home-grown talent - such as Beat Feuz and Carlo Janka - triumphed there. Rachel SchraerBBC Health Reporter As MPs have been mentioning today - a coronavirus variant has been found circulating in the Amazonas state of Brazil, and was picked up in Japan in travellers from the region. Itâs different from the UK and South African variants, but it contains common mutations - two changes to the virusâ ""spike"" in particular which have been flagged as potentially making the virus more infectious. This is not going to be the last mutation we hear about. At the moment changes are mainly being picked up in areas that do lots of genetic tracking of the virus - itâs almost certain there are other mutations already circulating unseen in other parts of the world. And the virus will continue to mutate - itâs just a question of how, how much and how fast. For now thereâs no evidence the virus is becoming more dangerous - but if more people catch it then, left unchecked, more will potentially become ill or die. But the vaccines, which target several different areas of the virusâ spike, should still work - though thatâs something that scientists the world over will be monitoring very closely. There have now been more deaths in the second wave of the pandemic than the first, Public Health England's medical director has said. Dr Yvonne Doyle was reacting to the new record of 1,564 deaths within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus in the UK that have been announced this hour. She said: âWith each passing day, more and more people are tragically losing their lives to this terrible virus, and today we have reported the highest number of deaths on a single day since the pandemic began. ""There have now been more deaths in the second wave than the first. âAbout one-in-three people with Covid-19 donât show symptoms, but can still pass it on to others so it is essential that we stay at home, minimise contact with other people and act as if you have the virus.â Labour's chair of the Home Affairs Committee Yvette Cooper, points out loopholes for travellers arriving home from abroad - including travelling on UK public transport when coming back from a holiday destination. Mr Johnson says there is a ""balanced approach"" from the government on the health of the nation vs the health of the economy. Ms Cooper says other countries brought in negative Covid tests as a requirement to travel ""months ago"" whereas the UK is only bringing these in from Friday. Mr Johnson says 3.5m passengers have been spot-checked since June 2020. He says a ""great deal of work"" goes into checking ""passenger data forms"" to check where people have come from. Ms Cooper says over 90% of those passenger data forms are not being checked. She says these checks ""might as well be voluntary"". Mr Johnson replies that those arriving from abroad are being screened. Ms Cooper asks why people from Brazil are not being checked for Covid, considering that there is a new strain in the South American country which could undermine the UK's vaccination programme. ""We are taking steps to ensure"" that the UK doesn't see the new variant in Brazil coming to the UK, replies Mr Johnson. Caroline Nokes, who chairs Parliament's Women and Equalities Commitee, then asks the PM about access to healthcare during the pandemic. She says the evidence shows it is women who are finding accessing services difficult, referring to a constituent who said her surgery was not currently doing smear tests. Nokes asks the PM what is an acceptable wait for a smear test? The PM says he sympathises with anybody who has had their treatment delayed. ""Sadly, that's what we are seeing. We're seeing delays in cancer, we're seeing delays in smear tests and vital services that people need, and that's a result in the increase in the numbers of Covid patients and that's why we have to work flat out to get the virus under control and reduce the current wave and give people the service we need."" Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Perhaps the most distressing element about the latest Covid deaths is that the numbers are almost certainly going to rise from here. People who are dying now are likely to have been infected around three weeks ago. That was at a point when infection rates were rising quite steeply, so in the coming days and weeks we should, sadly, expect to see more deaths than this. Todayâs figures are affected by the weekend, which sees delays reporting deaths that tend to translate into higher figures from Tuesday onwards. Currently around 800 to 900 people a day on average are dying once you take this into account. But the figures also provide some hope. For the third day, in a row the number of newly diagnosed infections are well below 50,000. There had been several days where they have exceeded 60,000. If that trend continues, and the number of new cases keeps coming down, that will eventually translate into the number of deaths falling. But it is going to take some weeks for that to happen. These are, as many have been saying, the darkest days of the pandemic so far. Caroline Nokes, who chairs Parliament's Women and Equalities Committee, asks the PM what additional protections are being put in place to help victims of domestic abuse who have insecure immigration status. The PM says the government has done ""what we can"" since the start of the pandemic to encourage victims of domestic abuse to come forward, including setting up helplines and investing in independent domestic abuse advisers. He says lockdown rules don't apply to victims of domestic abuse. Nokes follows up by asking why a better job is not being done of explaining lockdown rules to vulnerable people - for example, those who rely on British Sign Language or who might have learning difficulties. The PM says he has been asked a couple of times about sign language in particular, and he is going to ""take that away and see what we can do to increase sign language"". He adds that campaigns the government have produced are available in accessible formats and translations. Â© 2025 BBC.

More than 9.3 million of Americans have received the first shot of a Covid vaccine The US has been by far the world's worst-hit nation in the pandemic, with Johns Hopkins University reporting late on Tuesday a record 4,470 Covid-related deaths in the past 24 hours. Here are the latest key developments in America on Wednesday:  The US has had more than 22 million confirmed infections since the start of the outbreak, according to Johns Hopkins. The overall Covid-related death toll has now exceeded 380,000, and is closing in fast on the number of American soldiers killed in World War Two, at about 407,000.

A highly contagious strain of coronavirus first detected in South Africa has spread to 20 countries, the WHO says The World Health Organisation (WHO) has expressed concern about the spread of new coronavirus variants. A highly infectious strain, which originated in the UK, has now spread to 50 countries and territories, the WHO said. Since the strain was first detected late last year, it has driven a spike in coronavirus infections and deaths linked to the disease in the UK. A strain first identified in South Africa, meanwhile, has spread to 20 other countries, the WHO said. Health experts say both new variants appear to be more transmissible than previous strains but not necessarily any more dangerous. They have also played down the possibility that vaccines will not be as effective against these variants. Still, the increased transmission of these variants is taking its toll. ""Going into a second year of this [pandemic] could even be tougher given some of the transmission dynamics,"" WHO expert Mike Ryan said during an event on social media. There are also concerns about a third new strain the Japanese authorities have identified in four people who are thought to have caught it in Brazil.

Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva The event at Wengen is one of the most prestigious at the Ski World Cup Switzerlandâs iconic Lauberhorn ski race has been cancelled because of rising cases of Covid-19, many of them, Swiss health officials say, spread by one British tourist. The resort of Wengen, where the famous race is held, had recorded no cases of the virus until October, and only ten until mid-December. After that, cases began to shoot up, and, worryingly, sequencing revealed many of them were the new highly infectious variant first detected in the UK. Contact tracers found that 27 of the cases alone could be linked to one British tourist who recently stayed in a Wengen hotel. Wengen desperately tried to save the race, offering to close off the resort to everyone but competitors, and even closing its schools. At first Swiss health officials agreed, but when, at the start of this week yet more Covid-19 cases were recorded, they pulled the emergency brake. Wengen is devastated. The Lauberhorn is not just any race, but one of the top competitions on the Ski World Cup circuit. It is dearly loved by the Swiss, who have watched with delight as some of their own home-grown talent - such as Beat Feuz and Carlo Janka - triumphed there. Rachel SchraerBBC Health Reporter As MPs have been mentioning today - a coronavirus variant has been found circulating in the Amazonas state of Brazil, and was picked up in Japan in travellers from the region. Itâs different from the UK and South African variants, but it contains common mutations - two changes to the virusâ ""spike"" in particular which have been flagged as potentially making the virus more infectious. This is not going to be the last mutation we hear about. At the moment changes are mainly being picked up in areas that do lots of genetic tracking of the virus - itâs almost certain there are other mutations already circulating unseen in other parts of the world. And the virus will continue to mutate - itâs just a question of how, how much and how fast. For now thereâs no evidence the virus is becoming more dangerous - but if more people catch it then, left unchecked, more will potentially become ill or die. But the vaccines, which target several different areas of the virusâ spike, should still work - though thatâs something that scientists the world over will be monitoring very closely. There have now been more deaths in the second wave of the pandemic than the first, Public Health England's medical director has said. Dr Yvonne Doyle was reacting to the new record of 1,564 deaths within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus in the UK that have been announced this hour. She said: âWith each passing day, more and more people are tragically losing their lives to this terrible virus, and today we have reported the highest number of deaths on a single day since the pandemic began. ""There have now been more deaths in the second wave than the first. âAbout one-in-three people with Covid-19 donât show symptoms, but can still pass it on to others so it is essential that we stay at home, minimise contact with other people and act as if you have the virus.â Labour's chair of the Home Affairs Committee Yvette Cooper, points out loopholes for travellers arriving home from abroad - including travelling on UK public transport when coming back from a holiday destination. Mr Johnson says there is a ""balanced approach"" from the government on the health of the nation vs the health of the economy. Ms Cooper says other countries brought in negative Covid tests as a requirement to travel ""months ago"" whereas the UK is only bringing these in from Friday. Mr Johnson says 3.5m passengers have been spot-checked since June 2020. He says a ""great deal of work"" goes into checking ""passenger data forms"" to check where people have come from. Ms Cooper says over 90% of those passenger data forms are not being checked. She says these checks ""might as well be voluntary"". Mr Johnson replies that those arriving from abroad are being screened. Ms Cooper asks why people from Brazil are not being checked for Covid, considering that there is a new strain in the South American country which could undermine the UK's vaccination programme. ""We are taking steps to ensure"" that the UK doesn't see the new variant in Brazil coming to the UK, replies Mr Johnson. Caroline Nokes, who chairs Parliament's Women and Equalities Commitee, then asks the PM about access to healthcare during the pandemic. She says the evidence shows it is women who are finding accessing services difficult, referring to a constituent who said her surgery was not currently doing smear tests. Nokes asks the PM what is an acceptable wait for a smear test? The PM says he sympathises with anybody who has had their treatment delayed. ""Sadly, that's what we are seeing. We're seeing delays in cancer, we're seeing delays in smear tests and vital services that people need, and that's a result in the increase in the numbers of Covid patients and that's why we have to work flat out to get the virus under control and reduce the current wave and give people the service we need."" Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Perhaps the most distressing element about the latest Covid deaths is that the numbers are almost certainly going to rise from here. People who are dying now are likely to have been infected around three weeks ago. That was at a point when infection rates were rising quite steeply, so in the coming days and weeks we should, sadly, expect to see more deaths than this. Todayâs figures are affected by the weekend, which sees delays reporting deaths that tend to translate into higher figures from Tuesday onwards. Currently around 800 to 900 people a day on average are dying once you take this into account. But the figures also provide some hope. For the third day, in a row the number of newly diagnosed infections are well below 50,000. There had been several days where they have exceeded 60,000. If that trend continues, and the number of new cases keeps coming down, that will eventually translate into the number of deaths falling. But it is going to take some weeks for that to happen. These are, as many have been saying, the darkest days of the pandemic so far. Caroline Nokes, who chairs Parliament's Women and Equalities Committee, asks the PM what additional protections are being put in place to help victims of domestic abuse who have insecure immigration status. The PM says the government has done ""what we can"" since the start of the pandemic to encourage victims of domestic abuse to come forward, including setting up helplines and investing in independent domestic abuse advisers. He says lockdown rules don't apply to victims of domestic abuse. Nokes follows up by asking why a better job is not being done of explaining lockdown rules to vulnerable people - for example, those who rely on British Sign Language or who might have learning difficulties. The PM says he has been asked a couple of times about sign language in particular, and he is going to ""take that away and see what we can do to increase sign language"". He adds that campaigns the government have produced are available in accessible formats and translations. Â© 2025 BBC.

"We can make this the peak, says Matt HancockThe health secretary urges people to follow rules, saying ""individual decisions"" make a difference.UK","This video can not be played Matt Hancock: 'Together we can make this the peak' ""We can make this the peak"" of the coronavirus pandemic ""if enough people follow the rules"", Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said. He told BBC Breakfast it was ""those individual decisions"" that determine the virus's spread and it ""comes down to the behaviour of everyone"". People ""shouldn't take the mickey out of the rules,"" he said. Under the national lockdown, people in England must stay at home and only go out for limited reasons. This includes for food shopping, exercise, or work if they cannot do so from home. Similar measures are in place across much of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Latest figures show there are now more than 35,000 people in hospital with Covid - an increase on the spring peak. It comes as Prime Minister Boris Johnson is set to be questioned by MPs on the vaccine rollout later. Meanwhile, Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon is also due to announce whether there will be any changes to lockdown restrictions later. Ministershave been discussingthe possibility of tightening the current restrictions. Can I hug my vaccinated dad? And other questions What is a 'reasonable excuse' for leaving home? Postcode check: Find out the rules where you live Large trial of new Covid treatment begins in UK When asked on BBC Breakfast if this was the peak of this wave of the pandemic, Mr Hancock replied: ""I want it to be, but that comes down to the behaviour of everyone. ""Together we can make this the peak if enough people follow the rules which are incredibly clear."" Mr Hancock said England's lockdown measures were ""always under review"", but he would be ""very reluctant"" to remove the rule of meeting one other person outside for exercise as ""it is a lifeline"" for some people, including those who live alone. Mr Hancock has already ruled out scrapping support bubbles. ""What I'd rather is that everybody follow that rule and doesn't stretch it or flex it,"" he said. On the news that patients at a hospital in London are to be discharged early and sent to a hotel to help free up beds for critically ill coronavirus patients, Mr Hancock said moving patients to hotels ""isn't something we are actively putting in place"". King's College Hospital said it would help to create space for the ""high numbers"" of new admissions and would ""temporarily accommodate mainly homeless patients who are ready to safely leave hospital and will benefit from further support from community partners"". There are very early signs that infections may have peaked - although as always we should be careful about reading too much into a few days' worth of data. The past two days have seen newly diagnosed cases hover around the 46,000-mark. Up to the weekend, the average was close to 60,000. The drop has largely been driven by falls in new cases in London, the South East and East of England. The national picture does mask some regional differences. Cases are rising in the North West, which is causing particular concern. It is too early for the vaccination programme to be having any significant impact so a combination of the national lockdown on top of the tier four restrictions that were imposed in some areas before Christmas look like they may be beginning to have an impact. There is also some evidence the new variant may not be quite as fast-spreading as first feared - a Public Health England study suggested rather than being 70% more transmissible it may actually be somewhere between 30% to 50%. And, if it does represent the start of a continuous fall, it is important to remember it will still take some time to translate into fewer hospital cases - people being admitted at the moment are those who would have caught the virus a week or two ago. But after six weeks of pretty sustained rises, it is at least an encouraging sign. Asked aboutimages of elite footballers celebrating goals with hugs, Mr Hancock said: ""I think elite sport is important because these are tough times, and being able to watch the football on the telly is really important because there's loads of things that you can't do."" He said the Premier League has ""special arrangements to ensure that players are safe"" as well as a testing regime. The health secretary told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the rollout of the coronavirus vaccine will accelerate over the coming weeks, saying they were ""on track"" to deliver it to 14 million people by mid-February. Vaccines deployment minister Nadhim Zahawi later told the Commons' science and technology committee that he was ""confident"" of achieving this target. More than 2.4 million people have now had a first dose of a coronavirus vaccine, while 412,167 people have had a second dose. Mr Hancock said 40% of the 3.4m people over 80 in England had been vaccinated so far. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? YOUR QUESTIONS:We answer your queries GLOBAL SPREAD:How many worldwide cases are there? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters ""We have the capacity to get that vaccine out. The challenge is that we need to get the vaccine in,"" Mr Hancock said. ""What I know is that the supply will increase over the next few weeks and that means the very rapid rate that we are going at at the moment will continue to accelerate over the next couple of weeks."" On Tuesday, NHS Providers chief executive Chris Hopson said it was ""pretty clear"" that because of the new strain the Covid-19 infection rate was not going to go down as quickly as it did during the first wave. ""It now looks like the peak for NHS demand may actually be in February,"" he said.

There's been a lot of coronavirus news around today - here are some of the main headlines: Jordan has launched a Covid-19 vaccination programme intended
to protect more than 20% of the kingdomâs 10 million population. The government has said the first stage will focus on people
over the age of 60, those with chronic illnesses, and medical personnel. It aims
to administer 5,000 shots a day at 29 centres. Health Minister Nazir Obeidattold the state news agency Petra,externalthat the first day had gone âsmoothlyâ. But the head of the ministryâs epidemics and communicable
diseases department, Wael Hayajneh,urged more people to register for the free vaccines,external, with
only 200,000 reportedly signed up since late December. The government has purchased vaccines produced by Pfizer-BioNTech
and China's Sinopharm. The latter was granted an âemergency licenceâ on Saturday. Jordan has seen a sharp fall in the daily number of new
infections since mid-November, when restrictions that
had been eased during the summer were reintroduced. More than 309,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19
and 4,076 deaths have been reported since the start of the pandemic. There's been focus this week on whether people are adhering to the rules around wearing face coverings in shops. Tesco, Asda and Waitrose have becomethe latest supermarkets to say they will deny entry to shoppers who do not wear face masks,  unless they are medically exempt. It follows a similar move by Morrisons, while Sainsbury's says it will challenge those who flout the rules. So what protection do masks offer, what sort can be worn, and what are the rules across the UK? Read our explainer here The education select committee chairman has asked the PM for the roadmap for reopening schools in England. Robert Halfon asked the prime minister about the mental health and social isolation effects on children being away from schools. Boris Johnson says the lockdown measures âhave got to continue to workâ, after showing âsome early signs of progressâ.

""There have now been more deaths in the second wave than the first. âAbout one-in-three people with Covid-19 donât show symptoms, but can still pass it on to others so it is essential that we stay at home, minimise contact with other people and act as if you have the virus.â Labour's chair of the Home Affairs Committee Yvette Cooper, points out loopholes for travellers arriving home from abroad - including travelling on UK public transport when coming back from a holiday destination. Mr Johnson says there is a ""balanced approach"" from the government on the health of the nation vs the health of the economy. Ms Cooper says other countries brought in negative Covid tests as a requirement to travel ""months ago"" whereas the UK is only bringing these in from Friday. Mr Johnson says 3.5m passengers have been spot-checked since June 2020. He says a ""great deal of work"" goes into checking ""passenger data forms"" to check where people have come from. Ms Cooper says over 90% of those passenger data forms are not being checked. She says these checks ""might as well be voluntary"". Mr Johnson replies that those arriving from abroad are being screened. Ms Cooper asks why people from Brazil are not being checked for Covid, considering that there is a new strain in the South American country which could undermine the UK's vaccination programme. ""We are taking steps to ensure"" that the UK doesn't see the new variant in Brazil coming to the UK, replies Mr Johnson. Caroline Nokes, who chairs Parliament's Women and Equalities Commitee, then asks the PM about access to healthcare during the pandemic. She says the evidence shows it is women who are finding accessing services difficult, referring to a constituent who said her surgery was not currently doing smear tests. Nokes asks the PM what is an acceptable wait for a smear test? The PM says he sympathises with anybody who has had their treatment delayed. ""Sadly, that's what we are seeing. We're seeing delays in cancer, we're seeing delays in smear tests and vital services that people need, and that's a result in the increase in the numbers of Covid patients and that's why we have to work flat out to get the virus under control and reduce the current wave and give people the service we need."" Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Perhaps the most distressing element about the latest Covid deaths is that the numbers are almost certainly going to rise from here. People who are dying now are likely to have been infected around three weeks ago. That was at a point when infection rates were rising quite steeply, so in the coming days and weeks we should, sadly, expect to see more deaths than this. Todayâs figures are affected by the weekend, which sees delays reporting deaths that tend to translate into higher figures from Tuesday onwards. Currently around 800 to 900 people a day on average are dying once you take this into account. But the figures also provide some hope. For the third day, in a row the number of newly diagnosed infections are well below 50,000. There had been several days where they have exceeded 60,000. If that trend continues, and the number of new cases keeps coming down, that will eventually translate into the number of deaths falling. But it is going to take some weeks for that to happen. These are, as many have been saying, the darkest days of the pandemic so far. Caroline Nokes, who chairs Parliament's Women and Equalities Committee, asks the PM what additional protections are being put in place to help victims of domestic abuse who have insecure immigration status. The PM says the government has done ""what we can"" since the start of the pandemic to encourage victims of domestic abuse to come forward, including setting up helplines and investing in independent domestic abuse advisers. He says lockdown rules don't apply to victims of domestic abuse. Nokes follows up by asking why a better job is not being done of explaining lockdown rules to vulnerable people - for example, those who rely on British Sign Language or who might have learning difficulties. The PM says he has been asked a couple of times about sign language in particular, and he is going to ""take that away and see what we can do to increase sign language"". He adds that campaigns the government have produced are available in accessible formats and translations. Â© 2025 BBC.

Mum's 'sadness' at 'mean' free school meal parcelA minister has urged caterers to 'urgently' improve the quantity and quality of the food parcels.,"England and Man Utd footballer Marcus Rashford is a high-profile campaigner for children on free school meals and said the PM had assured him ""he is committed to correcting the issue"" A mother who posted a photo on social media of a food parcel she received has told of the ""sense of sadness"" she felt on seeing what it contained.

Chartwells, the firm which supplied the parcel, has apologised. The education secretary said schools will be able to offer vouchers rather than food parcels from next week.

Drill music 'increasingly used in court cases'The BBC's Steve Swann looks at the use of UK drill music as evidence in criminal prosecutions.UK,"Drill rap videos are increasingly being used as evidence in trials Drill music has captured headlines since it started to emerge in the UK in 2012. With its often provocative lyrics, it's been blamed by police for fuelling violence. It is also increasingly being used as evidence in trials with courts hearing allegations it incites gang rivalries. But some defence lawyers and academicsÂ say it stops defendants - often young black men - getting a fair trial. The BBC has looked into the detail of dozens of prosecutions across the UK. Wood Green on 2 February 2019 was ""more reminiscent of a Hollywood film than a winter's night in north London"", the Old Bailey was told. CCTV images showed mums with buggies fleeing as masked men ran amok with long knives. One man was shot and stabbed eight times but miraculously survived. Kamali Gabbidon-Lynck, 19, was less fortunate. He was chased into a hair salon where terrified customers, staff and children watched helplessly as he was stabbed to death. Five people were charged with his murder and put on trial. Three of them were just 16. Kamali Gabbidon-Lynck died after being stabbed five times The defendants could all be placed at the scene. But not all of them took part in the actual stabbing. The prosecution had to prove they were jointly guilty of murder. This is where drill music came in. It helped to tie the defendants together and establish a motive. There was a ""beef"" between street gangs, the court heard. Most of those on trial were linked to the gang known as Northumberland Park Killers. Their victims were linked to the rival Wood Green Mob. In these ""postcode killings"", itÂ was N17 versus N22. Others had previously lost their lives in the long-running feud and the hatred was played out in drill videos uploaded to YouTube. The court heard how 'Trills' Tyrell Graham, one of the defendants, had rapped about a fatal gang shooting the previous year. We were shown the lyrics. The first line is a reference to attacking opponents. The second to the victim. The prosecution claimed there were only two possible explanations for Tyrell Graham's lyrics: ""Either they describe the life he already leads or they describe the life he aspires to lead."" Drill lyrics were presented as evidence the defendants had embracedÂ a culture of violence. The jury agreed what took place that night was an ""organised sortie into enemy territory"". They found all five guilty of murder. ""These sentences take some very dangerous young criminals off the streets of the capital,"" the Crown Prosecution Service said. But for some experts the trial raised questions. They asked is it fair for a violent musical subculture to be used as evidence of involvement in crime? Or does drill - unlike other music - encourage acts of violence? Defenders of UK drill and rap argue it's an art form that shouldn't be taken literally. It uses violent language and imagery, but as one defence lawyer puts it, the Rolling Stones sang 'I'll stick my knife right down your throat, baby' but ""it doesn't mean (Mick) Jagger was involved in gangs"". Eithne Quinn, an academic at the University of Manchester, worries about the use of drill as evidence. She has worked as a defence expert witness on almost 20 trials and says juries are often shown videos featuring young men in balaclavas and masks, rapping about stabbings and drug dealing. They will be told ""this is like a diary entry, this is like a confession"", she says. Dr Quinn says drill rap is ""a very violent form"" of expression. ""It's out to shock. The music's meant to alienate parents."" But she says the provocative posturingÂ of the rapper is part and parcel of a popular genre and shouldn't be taken at face value. ""It has no place in the courtroom,"" says Dr Quinn who set up the Prosecuting Rap research project to widen understanding of what she considers the dangers of relying on drill and rap for court testimony. She acknowledges ""there are isolated instances when drill has incited violence"" but says drill is now being used in lots of cases and although it can initially look like there's a correlation between a rap and a violent act, ""when you look at it properly it falls away, it's not credible"".Â The BBC looked at nearly 70 trials across the UK from 2005 where drill and rap was used in evidence.Â Most were in the last two years and often rappers were on trial. Many featured allegations of murder. The vast majority of the defendants were young black men and boys. We identified a total of 232 people facing trial in the 67 cases. Only eight of them were female. Almost half were teenagers. Working with academics Eithne Quinn and Abenaa Owusu-Bempah, the BBC looked at nearly 70 trials across the UK We should be ""seriously concerned about what's happening in our courtrooms"", says Abenaa Owusu-Bempah, an expert in criminal evidence at the London School of Economics. She says the high number of black defendants ""indicates a targeting of rap music because we aren't seeing it with other genres of music"". Prosecutors draw on ""stereotypical imagery about young black men and boys as criminals"" and use drillÂ ""to amplify pre-existing stereotypes"", she says. She has identified 30 cases which were appealed. Only one was successful. For prosecutors that indicates the reliability and relevance of this type of evidence. But for Assistant Professor Owusu-Bempah, ""police, prosecutors and courts do not acknowledge or appreciate the artistic value of rap music"". Rosca Onya was 17 when he was convicted of firearm offences in 2010, after being arrested in a taxi by armed police in south-east London. Officers found a loaded handgun in a footwell of the car. It was before the UK drill scene took off but prosecutors used YouTube videos of him rapping as evidence of his gang membership. Onya protested they were ""to attract the attention of a record producer"". At an appeal hearing judges had to consider if ""the video was part of art"" or ""part of the life of warring gangs in south London"". In November 2010 they ruled the videos were relevant despite being made six months before the crime as they helped the jury understand the defendant's ""disposition"". His conviction was upheld and he spent over nine years in prison where he was rehabilitated and given therapy. First being exposed to violence growing up in Democratic Republic of Congo, he says he was encouraged into street gangs by older boys soon after arriving in the UK as a nine-year-old refugee. He acknowledges the police have to protect the public and doesn't deny his involvement in crime. But he says his youthful rapping was used unfairly against him in court. ""Young kids that were growing up in an environment that was chaotic in south London that's all we knew, that's all we saw. Of course I'm gonna talk about what I'm seeing around me... the drug dealing and young people getting into trouble."" He says his raps portrayed him as ""a monster"". His lyrics were presented as evidence that ""I was gonna shoot my rival gangs and that wasn't the case"". Rap is a form of poetry in which ""you are telling a story"", he adds. Rosca Onya said Jack Merritt gave him a voice Now, aged 29 and out of prison, Onya is using rap music to rebuild his damaged life. ""Music is a go-to tool for a lot of people to cope,"" he says. This week he is recording a new track, Patience, following the success of his song in praise of Jack Merritt, the man who helped turn his life around and who was murdered in a terrorist attack in London. Onya isn't a drill rapper but he says it isn't dangerous. ""These are kids finding a voice and trying to do something better with it."" For police and the Crown Prosecution Service the instant sharing of videos on social media means they've seen violentÂ disputes escalate quickly. Recently-issued guidance from the CPS to prosecutors noted that ""gangs are increasingly using drill music and social media to promote gang culture"". They point to 'diss' videos in which rivals are taunted. In December 2018 five young people were accused of killing a 17-year-old boy in Nottingham because of a dispute inflamed by drill videos. Lyrico Steede mocked his rivals as the ""Athlete Gang' because they ran away from fights. In retaliation he was lured to a park and repeatedly stabbed. Days later one of his alleged killers, Kasharn Campbell, 19, could be seen rapping in a video allegedly referring to the stabbing. This video can not be played Two drill music videos were recorded by the rival groups He and another man were convicted of murder. Three teenagers were found guilty of manslaughter. ""It is not for me to express a view about your or anyone's taste in music,"" the judge told the defendants. ""But this is a case about stabbing, and so much of that music is about stabbing."" In June 2019 the Met Police set up Project Alpha where officers from police gang unitsÂ monitor social media sites for evidence or intelligence about crime. That means monitoring drill videos where ""gangs have openly called out each other"", says Detective Inspector Kieran McAuliffe. ""What we're looking at is opportunities where we can intervene to stop some of the violence on the streets of London."" New figures given to the BBC show that since November 2016 the Met has made 579 referrals for ""potentially harmful content"" to be removed from social media platforms - 522 were removed, mostly from YouTube. The police deny they are censoring freedom of expression. ""We are not here to suppress drill music. It's fine to use it as an outlet,"" says DI McAuliffe, but he adds: ""Just think about what you're saying."" Does drill cause crime, or offer an escape from it?

There's been a lot of coronavirus news around today - here are some of the main headlines: Jordan has launched a Covid-19 vaccination programme intended
to protect more than 20% of the kingdomâs 10 million population. The government has said the first stage will focus on people
over the age of 60, those with chronic illnesses, and medical personnel. It aims
to administer 5,000 shots a day at 29 centres. Health Minister Nazir Obeidattold the state news agency Petra,externalthat the first day had gone âsmoothlyâ. But the head of the ministryâs epidemics and communicable
diseases department, Wael Hayajneh,urged more people to register for the free vaccines,external, with
only 200,000 reportedly signed up since late December. The government has purchased vaccines produced by Pfizer-BioNTech
and China's Sinopharm. The latter was granted an âemergency licenceâ on Saturday. Jordan has seen a sharp fall in the daily number of new
infections since mid-November, when restrictions that
had been eased during the summer were reintroduced. More than 309,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19
and 4,076 deaths have been reported since the start of the pandemic. There's been focus this week on whether people are adhering to the rules around wearing face coverings in shops. Tesco, Asda and Waitrose have becomethe latest supermarkets to say they will deny entry to shoppers who do not wear face masks,  unless they are medically exempt. It follows a similar move by Morrisons, while Sainsbury's says it will challenge those who flout the rules. So what protection do masks offer, what sort can be worn, and what are the rules across the UK? Read our explainer here The education select committee chairman has asked the PM for the roadmap for reopening schools in England. Robert Halfon asked the prime minister about the mental health and social isolation effects on children being away from schools. Boris Johnson says the lockdown measures âhave got to continue to workâ, after showing âsome early signs of progressâ. But he says it was âfar, far too earlyâ to say that would lead to a relaxation next month. This video can not be played Covid-19: Johnson and Halfon on lockdown effect on children Gavin StampBBC political reporter The UK governmentâs Covid O
committee is expected to discuss the new variant of coronavirus that has
emerged in Brazil tomorrow. The prime minister hinted to MPs that there could be restrictions on travel from Brazil to the UK - but a final decision has not been taken. Speaking to MPs he said: ""We are taking steps to ensure that we do not see
the import of this new variant from Brazil."" The Catholic Archbishop of Glasgow has died after contracting Covid-19 shortly after Christmas. Philip Tartaglia, 70, was one of the most senior figures in the Catholic Church in Scotland. The Church said his cause of death was not yet clear. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she felt ""deep sadness"" to hear of Archbishop Tartaglia's death. She told Scottish Parliament: ""I'm sure that is sadness shared by everybody across this chamber - and to send my deepest condolences to his loved ones and of course everybody in his community."" Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf said he had ""many fond memories"" of conversations he had shared with the archbishop. Philip Tartaglia was born in Glasgow in 1951 and was appointed Archbishop of Glasgow in 2012. He died on 13 January, which is the Feast of St Mungo - the patron saint of Glasgow. More than 9.3 million of Americans have received the first shot of a Covid vaccine The US has been by far the world's worst-hit nation in the pandemic, with Johns Hopkins University reporting late on Tuesday a record 4,470 Covid-related deaths in the past 24 hours. Here are the latest key developments in America on Wednesday:  The US has had more than 22 million confirmed infections since the start of the outbreak, according to Johns Hopkins. The overall Covid-related death toll has now exceeded 380,000, and is closing in fast on the number of American soldiers killed in World War Two, at about 407,000. Doctors' leaders have called for urgent improvements in personal protective equipment for health workers. The British Medical Association isappealing for a higher grade of face maskto guard against coronavirus infection. It says there is 'growing evidence' that the virus is being spread through the air by aerosols. These are tiny virus particles that can build up in stuffy rooms and they have been linked to outbreaks of Covid-19. This follows an open letter from more than 1,500 health professionals for staff on general wards to be given the type of high-quality masks usually only worn in intensive care units. Public Health England (PHE) has issued guidance on what PPE staff in different settings require. It was last updatedin October 2020,external. And you canread our explainer hereon face masks, including what protection they offer, what sort can be worn, and what the rules are across the UK. A highly contagious strain of coronavirus first detected in South Africa has spread to 20 countries, the WHO says The World Health Organisation (WHO) has expressed concern about the spread of new coronavirus variants. A highly infectious strain, which originated in the UK, has now spread to 50 countries and territories, the WHO said. Since the strain was first detected late last year, it has driven a spike in coronavirus infections and deaths linked to the disease in the UK. A strain first identified in South Africa, meanwhile, has spread to 20 other countries, the WHO said. Health experts say both new variants appear to be more transmissible than previous strains but not necessarily any more dangerous. They have also played down the possibility that vaccines will not be as effective against these variants. Still, the increased transmission of these variants is taking its toll. ""Going into a second year of this [pandemic] could even be tougher given some of the transmission dynamics,"" WHO expert Mike Ryan said during an event on social media. There are also concerns about a third new strain the Japanese authorities have identified in four people who are thought to have caught it in Brazil. BBC Radio 5 Live The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has been a major plank of the government's support during the pandemic. Under the furlough scheme, the government pays up to 80% of employees' wages up to Â£2,500. But it has been found to be open to abuse. New figures from HMRC given to BBC Radio 5 Live's Wake Up to Money programme show the department ishandling more than 21,000 reportsof suspected fraudulent use of the furlough scheme, 5,000 of which are under formal investigation. The money is either due to fraudulent claims, or is being paid out in error. The number of tip offs has spiralled sincelast April, from 3,000 to 21,378 reports of suspect payments by early January. HMRC told the BBC: ""This is taxpayers' money and fraudulent claims limit our ability to support people and deprive public services of essential funding."" The DUPâs Ian Paisley has failed to trigger an emergency Commons debate on the discarding of donated kidneys during the coronavirus pandemic. The MP for North Antrim said he had heard some viable organs had been discarded, and called for transplant operations to continue, perhaps using private facilities. Deputy Speaker Eleanor Laing later told him it would be not be allowed, but said a health minister was present and listening to his request. This video can not be played Covid-19: DUP MP says donated kidney discarded in pandemic Lisa SummersBBC Scotland Health Correspondent We heard earlier from Nicola Sturgeon thatrestrictions in Scotland will tightenfrom Saturday. The Scottish government is acting now because of the strain on the health service. Its experts are warning the NHS could beoverwhelmed even under a 'stay at home' scenario,external. We've already seen two health boards postponing all non-urgent surgical procedures as an increase in Covid cases puts growing pressure on the system. The action from NHS Lanarkshire and NHS Ayrshire and Arran is showing how the numbers of Covid patients in hospital is really starting to impact on wider care. Wards that would usually treat people recovering from hip or knee replacements for example may need to be converted into Covid wards. Theatres, usually busy carrying out multiple routine surgeries will become high dependency or intensive care facilities. When staff need to be redeployed to work with Covid patients, it is not safe to carry out other routine work. These are the difficult choices many health boards will face over the coming weeks. Action required now to deal with this health emergency will have consequences later. Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva The event at Wengen is one of the most prestigious at the Ski World Cup Switzerlandâs iconic Lauberhorn ski race has been cancelled because of rising cases of Covid-19, many of them, Swiss health officials say, spread by one British tourist. The resort of Wengen, where the famous race is held, had recorded no cases of the virus until October, and only ten until mid-December. After that, cases began to shoot up, and, worryingly, sequencing revealed many of them were the new highly infectious variant first detected in the UK. Contact tracers found that 27 of the cases alone could be linked to one British tourist who recently stayed in a Wengen hotel. Wengen desperately tried to save the race, offering to close off the resort to everyone but competitors, and even closing its schools. At first Swiss health officials agreed, but when, at the start of this week yet more Covid-19 cases were recorded, they pulled the emergency brake. Wengen is devastated. The Lauberhorn is not just any race, but one of the top competitions on the Ski World Cup circuit. It is dearly loved by the Swiss, who have watched with delight as some of their own home-grown talent - such as Beat Feuz and Carlo Janka - triumphed there. Rachel SchraerBBC Health Reporter As MPs have been mentioning today - a coronavirus variant has been found circulating in the Amazonas state of Brazil, and was picked up in Japan in travellers from the region. Itâs different from the UK and South African variants, but it contains common mutations - two changes to the virusâ ""spike"" in particular which have been flagged as potentially making the virus more infectious. This is not going to be the last mutation we hear about. At the moment changes are mainly being picked up in areas that do lots of genetic tracking of the virus - itâs almost certain there are other mutations already circulating unseen in other parts of the world. And the virus will continue to mutate - itâs just a question of how, how much and how fast. For now thereâs no evidence the virus is becoming more dangerous - but if more people catch it then, left unchecked, more will potentially become ill or die. But the vaccines, which target several different areas of the virusâ spike, should still work - though thatâs something that scientists the world over will be monitoring very closely. There have now been more deaths in the second wave of the pandemic than the first, Public Health England's medical director has said. Dr Yvonne Doyle was reacting to the new record of 1,564 deaths within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus in the UK that have been announced this hour. She said: âWith each passing day, more and more people are tragically losing their lives to this terrible virus, and today we have reported the highest number of deaths on a single day since the pandemic began. ""There have now been more deaths in the second wave than the first. âAbout one-in-three people with Covid-19 donât show symptoms, but can still pass it on to others so it is essential that we stay at home, minimise contact with other people and act as if you have the virus.â Labour's chair of the Home Affairs Committee Yvette Cooper, points out loopholes for travellers arriving home from abroad - including travelling on UK public transport when coming back from a holiday destination. Mr Johnson says there is a ""balanced approach"" from the government on the health of the nation vs the health of the economy. Ms Cooper says other countries brought in negative Covid tests as a requirement to travel ""months ago"" whereas the UK is only bringing these in from Friday. Mr Johnson says 3.5m passengers have been spot-checked since June 2020. He says a ""great deal of work"" goes into checking ""passenger data forms"" to check where people have come from. Ms Cooper says over 90% of those passenger data forms are not being checked. She says these checks ""might as well be voluntary"". Mr Johnson replies that those arriving from abroad are being screened. Ms Cooper asks why people from Brazil are not being checked for Covid, considering that there is a new strain in the South American country which could undermine the UK's vaccination programme. ""We are taking steps to ensure"" that the UK doesn't see the new variant in Brazil coming to the UK, replies Mr Johnson. Caroline Nokes, who chairs Parliament's Women and Equalities Commitee, then asks the PM about access to healthcare during the pandemic. She says the evidence shows it is women who are finding accessing services difficult, referring to a constituent who said her surgery was not currently doing smear tests. Nokes asks the PM what is an acceptable wait for a smear test? The PM says he sympathises with anybody who has had their treatment delayed. ""Sadly, that's what we are seeing. We're seeing delays in cancer, we're seeing delays in smear tests and vital services that people need, and that's a result in the increase in the numbers of Covid patients and that's why we have to work flat out to get the virus under control and reduce the current wave and give people the service we need."" Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Perhaps the most distressing element about the latest Covid deaths is that the numbers are almost certainly going to rise from here. People who are dying now are likely to have been infected around three weeks ago. That was at a point when infection rates were rising quite steeply, so in the coming days and weeks we should, sadly, expect to see more deaths than this. Todayâs figures are affected by the weekend, which sees delays reporting deaths that tend to translate into higher figures from Tuesday onwards. Currently around 800 to 900 people a day on average are dying once you take this into account. But the figures also provide some hope. For the third day, in a row the number of newly diagnosed infections are well below 50,000. There had been several days where they have exceeded 60,000. If that trend continues, and the number of new cases keeps coming down, that will eventually translate into the number of deaths falling. But it is going to take some weeks for that to happen. These are, as many have been saying, the darkest days of the pandemic so far. Caroline Nokes, who chairs Parliament's Women and Equalities Committee, asks the PM what additional protections are being put in place to help victims of domestic abuse who have insecure immigration status. The PM says the government has done ""what we can"" since the start of the pandemic to encourage victims of domestic abuse to come forward, including setting up helplines and investing in independent domestic abuse advisers. He says lockdown rules don't apply to victims of domestic abuse. Nokes follows up by asking why a better job is not being done of explaining lockdown rules to vulnerable people - for example, those who rely on British Sign Language or who might have learning difficulties. The PM says he has been asked a couple of times about sign language in particular, and he is going to ""take that away and see what we can do to increase sign language"". He adds that campaigns the government have produced are available in accessible formats and translations. Â© 2025 BBC.

How much of Trump's wall has been built?,"President Trump made building a wall a key plank of his 2016 election campaign President Donald Trump is visiting the southern border in Texas to claim success in the construction of a border fence with Mexico. The White House said his visit would ""mark the completion of more than 400 miles of border wall - a promise made, promise kept"". So how much of the border wall has Mr Trump managed to build during his term in office? Various types of fencing totalling 654 miles (just over 1,000 km) were already in place before Mr Trump became president in 2017. These ran through the states of California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas. The Trump administration say they've completed more than 400 miles of border wall since then. It's 452 miles (727 km) in total, according to the latest US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) information (4 January 2021). However, only 80 miles of new barriers have been built where there were none before - that includes 47 miles of primary wall, and 33 miles of secondary wall built to reinforce the initial barrier. The vast majority of the 452 miles is replacing existing structures at the border that had been built by previous US administrations. President Trump has argued that this should be regarded as new wall, because it's replacing what he called ""old and worthless barriers."" In 2016, President Trump repeatedly claimed Mexico would pay for the wall. This didn't happen. The US government has paid for the wall, and there've been arguments over how to fund it between the Trump administration and Congress. In January 2018, Mr Trump asked Congress to pay $18bn (Â£13.6bn) over the next decade for an initial phase of construction, but the bill ultimately failed. Some money was allocated by Congress in 2018 for projects at the border. However, in 2019 Mr Trump used national emergency powers to divert funds from the Department of Defense after Congress rejected more money for the wall. There has been around $15bn spent for the construction of the barrier coming from various US government departments, including the Department of Homeland Security, and the Defense and Treasury Departments. It was originally estimated a cross-border wall could cost anything from $12bn to $40bn. Despite this, in the run-up to the 3 November 2020 election, President Trump continued to say that ""Mexico is paying for it"". In the past, he's implied that a new trade agreement (signed last year) involving Mexico and Canada would indirectly save the US money, which could be spent on the wall. However, it's not clear how exactly this would work. President Trump also pledged to reduce illegal movement across the border. The number of people detained at the border increased significantly between 2018 and 2019, but dropped off in 2020. ""The decrease in apprehensions comes as the movement of migrants in the Americas and worldwide has slowed during the Covid-19 outbreak, with governments fully or partially closing their borders to stem its spread,"" according to Ana Gonzalez-Barrera,a senior researcher at Pew Research, a nonpartisan think tank based in Washington DC.,external President-elect Joe Biden has said that he will not continue further construction of the wall. He said he would not build ""another foot"" and made clear he opposed taking funds from the Department of Defense. Instead, the Democratic president-elect plans to focus on using technology along the border to detect illegal activity. Joe Biden's official website says: ""Biden will direct federal resources to smart border enforcement efforts, like investments in improving screening infrastructure at our ports of entry."" However, it is unclear what the new administration will do with contracts for wall construction which have already been awarded under Mr Trump - but are as yet not finished.

How many arrests so far from Capitol riots?,"Jon Schaffer, pictured wearing a blue jacket, was seen in news photos taken during the riot Exactly 100 days since the 6 January riot that saw a pro-Trump mob storm the US Capitol, prosecutors have their first guilty plea. Jon Schaffer, 53, a member of the Oath Keepers militia group, pleaded guilty to two charges - obstruction of an official proceeding and entering a restricted building with a dangerous weapon. Schaffer, who is also a heavy metal guitarist in the band Iced Earth, had originally faced six charges including using a chemical irritant designed for grizzly bears on police officers during clashes. He turned himself to FBI agents in Indiana two weeks after his arrest, and after a photo of him inside the Capitol wearing a hat reading ""Oath Keepers Lifetime Member"" appeared on the front pages of US newspapers. He is facing 30 years in prison and is expected to co-operate with investigators. The suspects in the Capitol riot are a varied group: they include an ousted West Virginia lawmaker, several police officers and a left-wing activist from Utah. Most of the rioters were allowed to leave the crime scene, forcing investigators to conduct a national manhunt for the pro-Trump crowd that stormed the halls of Congress. Investigators for the District of Columbia says they have identified over 540 suspects and charged some 400 people in connection with the Capitol siege. Just weeks after the rampage in January, FBI officials said they had already been inundated with 140,000 videos and photos from members of the public. Officials say they are considering filing serious charges of seditious activity against some individuals who were involved in the siege on the Capitol. According to federal criminal code, seditious conspiracy means an effort to conspire to overthrow the US government. The punishment is severe: up to 20 years in prison. The hunt to identify and arrest Capitol rioters Jacob Anthony Chansley wore horns and a fur hat inside the Senate chamber The rioters facing federal charges hail from 42 out of the 50 US states and the District of Columbia, according to theGeorge Washington University extremism tracker,external. Only a few came from pro-Trump strongholds. Most came from districts that voted for Joe Biden in the November election. In March, the FBI made its first arrest of a Trump appointee, former State Department aide Federico Guillermo Klein. Mr Klein, 42, is accused of multiple felonies related to the riot, including beating police with a stolen riot shield. He was still employed by the State Department as a staff assistant when he joined the mob on 6 January. He is also a former Trump campaign employee, US media report. Five of those arrested were police officers. Nearly 30 were active-duty or retired members of the military. Five revelations from Capitol riot arrests About 90% of those arrested have been white, according to an analysis by the Chicago Project on Security and Threats. Most have been over the age of 40, surprising given that the average age for those involved in political violence around the world is late 20s to early 30s. Many of those arrested were employed, or even wealthy, including Dr Simone Gold, 55, from Beverly Hills, California. She was among a group of doctors that last year spread misleading claims about the coronavirus, including that hydroxychloroquine - a drug touted relentlessly by Mr Trump - was an effective treatment. Jenna Ryan - a real estate broker from Dallas, Texas - garnered attention on social media after she flew to DC by private jet to join the march to the Capitol. Analysis by BBC Monitoring and BBC Reality Check Robert Keith Packer One of the most striking images from that day showed a man wearing a hoodie with the words: ""Camp Auschwitz"". Auschwitz was a Nazi extermination camp where more than a million people, mostly Jews, were murdered during World War Two by Germany. Mr Packer was arrested in Virginia and has been charged with trespassing in a federal building and ""violent entry and disorderly conduct"" on Capitol grounds. Mr Packer wore a garment with the slogan ""Camp Auschwitz"" Jake Angeli - 'Q Shaman' Jacob Anthony Chansley, known as Jake Angeli or as he describes himself the ""Q Shaman"", is a well-known follower of the unfounded QAnon conspiracy theory who lives in Glendale, Arizona. QAnon supporters believe Mr Trump and a secret military intelligence team are battling a deep state cabal of Satan-worshipping paedophiles in the Democratic Party, media, business and Hollywood. Known for appearing with a painted face, fur hat and horns while carrying a ""Q sent me"" banner in public, Mr Chansley, 33, has been charged with violent entry and disorderly conduct after appearing in multiple images inside the halls of Congress and the Senate chamber. In videos posted to his social media accounts, he shouts about child-trafficking in front of government buildings or inside shopping malls, and attends pro-Trump or QAnon-linked ""save our children"" rallies. Like many of his fellow QAnon followers, Mr Chansley says he believes Covid-19 is a hoax. Mr Trump - viewed as a hero by the movement - has stopped short of endorsing the conspiracy theory but has described QAnon activists as ""people who love our country."" Officer Eugene Goodman confronts Doug Jensen Doug Jensen - QAnon Doug Jensen, 41, from Des Moines, Iowa, appeared in one video showing a lone African American officer holding back the mob. Mr Jensen has been arrested and faces five federal charges, including violent entry and disorderly conduct and obstructing a law enforcement officer during a civil disorder. In it, he can be seen chasing a police officer up a flight of stairs inside the Capitol wearing a shirt with the QAnon slogan ""trust the plan"". The Capitol police officer hailed as a 'hero' Mr Jensen later identified himself on his Twitter account, tweeting: ""You like my shirt?"" and ""Meâ¦"" under images of him inside the Capitol shared by fellow QAnon supporters. On his Twitter, Mr Jensen regularly expresses support for President Trump, engages with well-known QAnon accounts, and tweets QAnon phrases such as WWG1WGA - short for ""where we go one we go all"" - a rallying cry for the conspiracy's adherents. Nick Ochs - Proud Boys Nick Ochs was arrested at an airport in Honolulu, Hawaii, by the FBI, as he returned home from Washington DC. He's accused of unlawful entry of restricted buildings or grounds, after he posted a picture smoking a cigarette inside the Capitol building, tweeting: ""Hello from the Capital lol"". Mr Ochs describes himself as a ""Proud Boy Elder from Hawaii"". The Proud Boys is an anti-immigrant and all male far-right group founded in 2016. President Trump addressed this group specifically in the first presidential debate. In response to a question about white supremacists and militias he said: ""Proud Boys, stand back and stand by."" Richard Barnett Richard Barnett is the man pictured with his feet on a desk in Speaker Nancy Pelosi's office. He was also pictured outside the Capitol with a personalised envelope he took from her office. He's been arrested for unlawful entry, disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds, and theft of public money, property, or records. Mr Barnett is 60 years old and from Arkansas. Local media reports say Mr Barnett is involved in a group that supports gun rights, and that he was interviewed at a ""Stop the Steal"" rally following the presidential election - the movement that supports Mr Trump's unsubstantiated claims of election fraud. Derrick Evans Less than a month after he was sworn in as a Republican delegate in the West Virginia state legislature, Mr Evans filmed himself pushing through the crowd as he stormed the Capitol wearing what appears to be a motorcycle helmet. ""We're going in,"" he said in the now-deleted Facebook live stream. ""We did it! Derrick Evans is in the Capitol!"" he yelled, adding, ""patriots inside, baby!"" His participation in the riot led lawmakers in his home state to consider cutting off his access to the West Virginia statehouse. But within a week of the riot, he had resigned. He is facing federal charges of trespassing and disorderly conduct. Riley June Williams tried to delete her accounts, prosecutors say Riley June Williams The 22-year-old Pennsylvania woman, is accused of stealing a laptop from the office of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The FBI has said that Ms Williams' former romantic partner told them that she had appeared in pictures of the Capitol riot. She allegedly had said that she hoped to sell the laptop to Russian intelligence agents. An aide to Mrs Pelosi said the computer was only used for presentations. It has yet to be recovered by investigators. Federal cases are ongoing across the country and could lead to some significant prison sentences for those involved. Acting US Attorney Michael Sherwin said in February: ""The scope and scale of this investigation in these cases are really unprecedented, not only in FBI history but probably [Department of Justice] history."" Dozens of suspects have requested public defenders - lawyers provided by the government - leaving taxpayers to pay millions of dollars in defendants' legal bills. The cases have also flooded the Washington DC legal system, where semi-returned judges have been called upon to hear the influx of cases. At least one defendant has argued that their case should be heard out of Washington because they would be unable to get a fair trial there. At least seven of the key suspects have told investigators that they travelled to the Capitol after President Trump told them to go in a speech that preceded the riot. The so-called Q Shaman requested a pardon from Mr Trump before he left office, citing ""the peaceful and compliant fashion in which Mr Chansley comported himself"" during the riot. According to a local ABC news station, a judge has agreed that Mr Chansley should be ""provided food in line with a shaman's strict organic diet"" after he refused to eat the meals provided at the jailhouse. Riley June Williams, the woman accused of stealing a congressional laptop, was ordered to stay off the internet after she allegedly attempted to delete her information and encouraged others to do the same. A man allegedly seen in viral photos carrying a Confederate flag in the Capitol during the riots was charged on 14 January. Authorities in Delaware charged Kevin Seefried and his son Hunter with entering a restricted building, violent entry and disorderly conduct. According to court documentscited by the Delaware News Journal,external, the duo got into the Capitol building through a window that Hunter helped break, before they ""verbally confronted"" US Capitol Police officers and the son took a selfie.

A left-wing activist was also arrested after tweeting video of himself inside the US Capitol as protesters breached security.

He has identified himself in media interviews as a Black Lives Matter supporter, but rejects any association with antifa, a loosely affiliated group of far-left protesters. Following the death of George Floyd last year, Mr Sullivan founded an activist group in Utah that advocates for racial justice. He was charged in July 2020 with felony riot and criminal mischief over civil unrest in Provo, Utah. Two men who were allegedly pictured bringing plastic restraints into the Capitol were also arrested this month. Authorities say Eric Gavelek Munchel is the individual seen carrying a number of plastic zip ties inside the Senate chamber. He was detained in Tennessee. Larry Rendell Brock, who is accused of entering the Capitol with a white flex cuff - a restraining device used by law enforcement - was arrested in Texas.

Duchess of York to publish Mills & Boon novel,"Sarah Ferguson has a long-held interest in history, especially that of the royals and the aristocracy Sarah Ferguson, Duchess of York, has written her first novel for adults, to be released by the leading romantic fiction publisher Mills & Boon. Her Heart for a Compass is based on the life of the duchess's great-great-aunt, Lady Margaret Montagu Douglas Scott. She has previously written children's books, non-fiction about Queen Victoria, and her own memoirs. She said: ""I am proud to bring my personal brand of historical fiction to the publishing world."" ""It all started with researching my ancestry. Digging into the history of the Montagu-Douglas Scotts, I first came across Lady Margaret, who intrigued me because she shared one of my given names,"" she added. ""But although her parents, the Duke and Duchess of Buccleuch, were close friends with Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, I was unable to discover much about my namesake's early life, and so was born the idea which became Her Heart for a Compass."" The story will include some real people and events and also draw on the duchess's own experiences but she said ""my imagination took over"". ""I have long held a passion for historical research and telling the stories of strong women in history through film and television,"" she added. Emily Blunt starred in the film Young Victoria For the big screen, she conceived the idea for the 2009 movie Young Victoria, starring Emily Blunt and written by Julian Fellowes. She was a producer on the film and her daughter, Princess Beatrice, had a minor part. The duchess also worked on a documentary about Princess Louise of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg, Prince Albert's mother. She recently revived her children's book series,Budgie the Helicopter.,external Heart for a Compass was written with the collaboration of established Mills & Boon novelist Marguerite Kaye, who has created more than 50 novels for the imprint, set in a variety of eras. The duchess's novel is a saga that takes in events at Queen Victoria's court and the grand country houses of Scotland and Ireland, and crosses into the slums of London and on to the bustle of 1870s New York. Mills & Boon described the story as a ""fascinating journey of a woman, born into the higher echelons of society, who desires to break the mould, follow her internal compass (her heart) and discover her raison d'Ãªtre - and falling in love along the way"". Mills & Boon's world of innuendo Mills & Boon to publish spoof 'modern girl's guides' Should Mills and Boon be taken seriously as feminist texts? Mills & Boon is the UK's top publisher of romantic fiction and says it sells one of its novels every 10 seconds. The stories are ""written by women, for women, it has a romance for every reader promising a happily-ever-after ending every time"", it adds. Other well-known names to venture into the Mills & Boon world include Made in Chelsea and I'm A Celebrity star Georgia Toffolo, whose debut romance novel, Meet Me in London, came out last year. Best-selling authors have also created stories for Mills & Boon under a pseudonym, including Destiny writer Sally Beauman (Vanessa James) and The Shell Seekers author Rosamunde Pilcher (Jane Fraser).

Customs staff: Vaccinate us to keep trade flowing,"Customs operators have pleaded with the government to prioritise vaccinations for staff they insist are key front-line workers in the effort to keep vital supplies flowing into the UK. One operator told the BBC his staff were working flat out - often up to 16 hours a day - to help traders comply with the new post-Brexit customs requirements. ""A Covid outbreak would be disastrous. Customs clearance staff should be identified as key workers and fast-tracked for vaccination."" Another said he had written to Transport Secretary Grant Shapps and his local MP for Ashford, Damian Green saying any coronavirus-related staff shortages could force them to close. ""We have 14 staff. Two have already had to self-isolate, if we lose any more we would have to consider closing"". Rod McKenzie of the Road Haulage Association supports the argument to accelerate vaccinations of port and customs staff. ""Customs agents are absolutely swamped, they are understaffed by tens of thousands and although volumes have been light thanks to pre-Christmas and pre-Brexit stockpiling, we are approaching a critical point:"" Steve Cock of logistics firm KGH said that volume would begin to build this week and described Friday as ""a moment of truth"" as volumes would be close to normal, imposing the first serious test of the system's capacity. The government told the BBC that vaccination priorities were based on clinical vulnerability determined by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation. Although the government said it would be looking at key workers beyond the current priorities - like teachers - that would not come till after phase 1 of the current programme ends. That is not expected till late March at the earliest. Although the ports themselves have been running reasonably smoothly, that is because many traders aren't getting as far as the ports as their documentation is not complete. The Dover-Calais crossing last week saw only 40% of its usual traffic for this time of year. Many foreign hauliers have been avoiding the UK for fear of getting stuck on the wrong side of the channel or raising their prices by as much as six times to compensate for the additional risks of congestion. Cracks in the system have already started to show with large European delivery firm DPD cancelling road deliveries from the UK to the EU while Ocado, M&S, and Fortnum and Mason have cited problems delivering to customers in the EU and Northern Ireland. Fish and seafood exports have been particularly hard hit. Many small traders who usually club together to share the cost of space on large lorries headed to their primary markets in the EU have hit serious roadblocks. Products of animal origin now need Export Health Certificates signed off by veterinary professionals. The burden of getting multiple certificates for single lorries has brought exports to the EU to a virtual standstill for some traders. The focus in the UK is understandably primarily on food supplies into the UK and although there are some limited shortages being reported in fruit and vegetable supplies, shelves in the UK are showing very few gaps. The problems are more acute in Northern Ireland, which for the purposes of trade is still part of the EU customs area. For that reason, what is happening to food exports from GB to Northern Ireland is perhaps a useful proxy for what is happening to UK food exports to the EU. The last thing the UK-EU trade machinery can afford right now is for critical staff - caught in the crossfire of pandemic and Brexit - to be laid low.

Updates were brought to you by Alex Therrien, Alice Evans, Claire Heald, David Gritten, Jennifer Meierhans, Joshua Nevett, Lauren Turner, Paul Seddon, Richard Morris, Vanessa Buschschluter, Vicky Baker and Yaroslav Lukov. There's been a lot of coronavirus news around today - here are some of the main headlines: Jordan has launched a Covid-19 vaccination programme intended
to protect more than 20% of the kingdomâs 10 million population. The government has said the first stage will focus on people
over the age of 60, those with chronic illnesses, and medical personnel. It aims
to administer 5,000 shots a day at 29 centres. Health Minister Nazir Obeidattold the state news agency Petra,externalthat the first day had gone âsmoothlyâ. But the head of the ministryâs epidemics and communicable
diseases department, Wael Hayajneh,urged more people to register for the free vaccines,external, with
only 200,000 reportedly signed up since late December. The government has purchased vaccines produced by Pfizer-BioNTech
and China's Sinopharm. The latter was granted an âemergency licenceâ on Saturday. Jordan has seen a sharp fall in the daily number of new
infections since mid-November, when restrictions that
had been eased during the summer were reintroduced. More than 309,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19
and 4,076 deaths have been reported since the start of the pandemic. There's been focus this week on whether people are adhering to the rules around wearing face coverings in shops. Tesco, Asda and Waitrose have becomethe latest supermarkets to say they will deny entry to shoppers who do not wear face masks,  unless they are medically exempt. It follows a similar move by Morrisons, while Sainsbury's says it will challenge those who flout the rules. So what protection do masks offer, what sort can be worn, and what are the rules across the UK? Read our explainer here The education select committee chairman has asked the PM for the roadmap for reopening schools in England. Robert Halfon asked the prime minister about the mental health and social isolation effects on children being away from schools. Boris Johnson says the lockdown measures âhave got to continue to workâ, after showing âsome early signs of progressâ. But he says it was âfar, far too earlyâ to say that would lead to a relaxation next month. This video can not be played Covid-19: Johnson and Halfon on lockdown effect on children Gavin StampBBC political reporter The UK governmentâs Covid O
committee is expected to discuss the new variant of coronavirus that has
emerged in Brazil tomorrow. The prime minister hinted to MPs that there could be restrictions on travel from Brazil to the UK - but a final decision has not been taken. Speaking to MPs he said: ""We are taking steps to ensure that we do not see
the import of this new variant from Brazil."" The Catholic Archbishop of Glasgow has died after contracting Covid-19 shortly after Christmas. Philip Tartaglia, 70, was one of the most senior figures in the Catholic Church in Scotland. The Church said his cause of death was not yet clear. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she felt ""deep sadness"" to hear of Archbishop Tartaglia's death. She told Scottish Parliament: ""I'm sure that is sadness shared by everybody across this chamber - and to send my deepest condolences to his loved ones and of course everybody in his community."" Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf said he had ""many fond memories"" of conversations he had shared with the archbishop. Philip Tartaglia was born in Glasgow in 1951 and was appointed Archbishop of Glasgow in 2012. He died on 13 January, which is the Feast of St Mungo - the patron saint of Glasgow. More than 9.3 million of Americans have received the first shot of a Covid vaccine The US has been by far the world's worst-hit nation in the pandemic, with Johns Hopkins University reporting late on Tuesday a record 4,470 Covid-related deaths in the past 24 hours. Here are the latest key developments in America on Wednesday:  The US has had more than 22 million confirmed infections since the start of the outbreak, according to Johns Hopkins. The overall Covid-related death toll has now exceeded 380,000, and is closing in fast on the number of American soldiers killed in World War Two, at about 407,000. Doctors' leaders have called for urgent improvements in personal protective equipment for health workers. The British Medical Association isappealing for a higher grade of face maskto guard against coronavirus infection. It says there is 'growing evidence' that the virus is being spread through the air by aerosols. These are tiny virus particles that can build up in stuffy rooms and they have been linked to outbreaks of Covid-19. This follows an open letter from more than 1,500 health professionals for staff on general wards to be given the type of high-quality masks usually only worn in intensive care units. Public Health England (PHE) has issued guidance on what PPE staff in different settings require. It was last updatedin October 2020,external. And you canread our explainer hereon face masks, including what protection they offer, what sort can be worn, and what the rules are across the UK. A highly contagious strain of coronavirus first detected in South Africa has spread to 20 countries, the WHO says The World Health Organisation (WHO) has expressed concern about the spread of new coronavirus variants. A highly infectious strain, which originated in the UK, has now spread to 50 countries and territories, the WHO said. Since the strain was first detected late last year, it has driven a spike in coronavirus infections and deaths linked to the disease in the UK. A strain first identified in South Africa, meanwhile, has spread to 20 other countries, the WHO said. Health experts say both new variants appear to be more transmissible than previous strains but not necessarily any more dangerous. They have also played down the possibility that vaccines will not be as effective against these variants. Still, the increased transmission of these variants is taking its toll. ""Going into a second year of this [pandemic] could even be tougher given some of the transmission dynamics,"" WHO expert Mike Ryan said during an event on social media. There are also concerns about a third new strain the Japanese authorities have identified in four people who are thought to have caught it in Brazil. BBC Radio 5 Live The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has been a major plank of the government's support during the pandemic. Under the furlough scheme, the government pays up to 80% of employees' wages up to Â£2,500. But it has been found to be open to abuse. New figures from HMRC given to BBC Radio 5 Live's Wake Up to Money programme show the department ishandling more than 21,000 reportsof suspected fraudulent use of the furlough scheme, 5,000 of which are under formal investigation. The money is either due to fraudulent claims, or is being paid out in error. The number of tip offs has spiralled sincelast April, from 3,000 to 21,378 reports of suspect payments by early January. HMRC told the BBC: ""This is taxpayers' money and fraudulent claims limit our ability to support people and deprive public services of essential funding."" The DUPâs Ian Paisley has failed to trigger an emergency Commons debate on the discarding of donated kidneys during the coronavirus pandemic. The MP for North Antrim said he had heard some viable organs had been discarded, and called for transplant operations to continue, perhaps using private facilities. Deputy Speaker Eleanor Laing later told him it would be not be allowed, but said a health minister was present and listening to his request. This video can not be played Covid-19: DUP MP says donated kidney discarded in pandemic Lisa SummersBBC Scotland Health Correspondent We heard earlier from Nicola Sturgeon thatrestrictions in Scotland will tightenfrom Saturday. The Scottish government is acting now because of the strain on the health service. Its experts are warning the NHS could beoverwhelmed even under a 'stay at home' scenario,external. We've already seen two health boards postponing all non-urgent surgical procedures as an increase in Covid cases puts growing pressure on the system. The action from NHS Lanarkshire and NHS Ayrshire and Arran is showing how the numbers of Covid patients in hospital is really starting to impact on wider care. Wards that would usually treat people recovering from hip or knee replacements for example may need to be converted into Covid wards. Theatres, usually busy carrying out multiple routine surgeries will become high dependency or intensive care facilities. When staff need to be redeployed to work with Covid patients, it is not safe to carry out other routine work. These are the difficult choices many health boards will face over the coming weeks. Action required now to deal with this health emergency will have consequences later. Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva The event at Wengen is one of the most prestigious at the Ski World Cup Switzerlandâs iconic Lauberhorn ski race has been cancelled because of rising cases of Covid-19, many of them, Swiss health officials say, spread by one British tourist. The resort of Wengen, where the famous race is held, had recorded no cases of the virus until October, and only ten until mid-December. After that, cases began to shoot up, and, worryingly, sequencing revealed many of them were the new highly infectious variant first detected in the UK. Contact tracers found that 27 of the cases alone could be linked to one British tourist who recently stayed in a Wengen hotel. Wengen desperately tried to save the race, offering to close off the resort to everyone but competitors, and even closing its schools. At first Swiss health officials agreed, but when, at the start of this week yet more Covid-19 cases were recorded, they pulled the emergency brake. Wengen is devastated. The Lauberhorn is not just any race, but one of the top competitions on the Ski World Cup circuit. It is dearly loved by the Swiss, who have watched with delight as some of their own home-grown talent - such as Beat Feuz and Carlo Janka - triumphed there. Rachel SchraerBBC Health Reporter As MPs have been mentioning today - a coronavirus variant has been found circulating in the Amazonas state of Brazil, and was picked up in Japan in travellers from the region. Itâs different from the UK and South African variants, but it contains common mutations - two changes to the virusâ ""spike"" in particular which have been flagged as potentially making the virus more infectious. This is not going to be the last mutation we hear about. At the moment changes are mainly being picked up in areas that do lots of genetic tracking of the virus - itâs almost certain there are other mutations already circulating unseen in other parts of the world. And the virus will continue to mutate - itâs just a question of how, how much and how fast. For now thereâs no evidence the virus is becoming more dangerous - but if more people catch it then, left unchecked, more will potentially become ill or die. But the vaccines, which target several different areas of the virusâ spike, should still work - though thatâs something that scientists the world over will be monitoring very closely. There have now been more deaths in the second wave of the pandemic than the first, Public Health England's medical director has said. Dr Yvonne Doyle was reacting to the new record of 1,564 deaths within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus in the UK that have been announced this hour. She said: âWith each passing day, more and more people are tragically losing their lives to this terrible virus, and today we have reported the highest number of deaths on a single day since the pandemic began. ""There have now been more deaths in the second wave than the first. âAbout one-in-three people with Covid-19 donât show symptoms, but can still pass it on to others so it is essential that we stay at home, minimise contact with other people and act as if you have the virus.â Labour's chair of the Home Affairs Committee Yvette Cooper, points out loopholes for travellers arriving home from abroad - including travelling on UK public transport when coming back from a holiday destination. Mr Johnson says there is a ""balanced approach"" from the government on the health of the nation vs the health of the economy. Ms Cooper says other countries brought in negative Covid tests as a requirement to travel ""months ago"" whereas the UK is only bringing these in from Friday. Mr Johnson says 3.5m passengers have been spot-checked since June 2020. He says a ""great deal of work"" goes into checking ""passenger data forms"" to check where people have come from. Ms Cooper says over 90% of those passenger data forms are not being checked. She says these checks ""might as well be voluntary"". Mr Johnson replies that those arriving from abroad are being screened. Ms Cooper asks why people from Brazil are not being checked for Covid, considering that there is a new strain in the South American country which could undermine the UK's vaccination programme. ""We are taking steps to ensure"" that the UK doesn't see the new variant in Brazil coming to the UK, replies Mr Johnson. Caroline Nokes, who chairs Parliament's Women and Equalities Commitee, then asks the PM about access to healthcare during the pandemic. She says the evidence shows it is women who are finding accessing services difficult, referring to a constituent who said her surgery was not currently doing smear tests. Nokes asks the PM what is an acceptable wait for a smear test? The PM says he sympathises with anybody who has had their treatment delayed. ""Sadly, that's what we are seeing. We're seeing delays in cancer, we're seeing delays in smear tests and vital services that people need, and that's a result in the increase in the numbers of Covid patients and that's why we have to work flat out to get the virus under control and reduce the current wave and give people the service we need."" Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Perhaps the most distressing element about the latest Covid deaths is that the numbers are almost certainly going to rise from here. People who are dying now are likely to have been infected around three weeks ago. That was at a point when infection rates were rising quite steeply, so in the coming days and weeks we should, sadly, expect to see more deaths than this. Todayâs figures are affected by the weekend, which sees delays reporting deaths that tend to translate into higher figures from Tuesday onwards. Currently around 800 to 900 people a day on average are dying once you take this into account. But the figures also provide some hope. For the third day, in a row the number of newly diagnosed infections are well below 50,000. There had been several days where they have exceeded 60,000. If that trend continues, and the number of new cases keeps coming down, that will eventually translate into the number of deaths falling. But it is going to take some weeks for that to happen. These are, as many have been saying, the darkest days of the pandemic so far. Caroline Nokes, who chairs Parliament's Women and Equalities Committee, asks the PM what additional protections are being put in place to help victims of domestic abuse who have insecure immigration status. The PM says the government has done ""what we can"" since the start of the pandemic to encourage victims of domestic abuse to come forward, including setting up helplines and investing in independent domestic abuse advisers. He says lockdown rules don't apply to victims of domestic abuse. Nokes follows up by asking why a better job is not being done of explaining lockdown rules to vulnerable people - for example, those who rely on British Sign Language or who might have learning difficulties. The PM says he has been asked a couple of times about sign language in particular, and he is going to ""take that away and see what we can do to increase sign language"". He adds that campaigns the government have produced are available in accessible formats and translations. Â© 2025 BBC.

Attenborough to front government-funded 5G AR app,"Sir David will appear in ""very high-resolution holographic video"" Sir David Attenborough is to front an augmented reality app letting users see exotic plants and animals in their own surroundings, as part of a government drive to prove the uses of 5G. The Green Planet AR app has been given Â£2.3m government funding as one of nine 5G test projects given a total of Â£28m. It will be released alongside The Green Planet, Sir David's forthcoming BBC series that will show plants in detail. The five-part documentary series is expected to be broadcast in 2022. Augmented reality superimposes virtual objects on to the world around us, meaning the app's users will be able to use their smartphones to see Sir David and ""meticulously detailed graphics of exotic plants and animals"" as if they were in front of them. The app will help prove ""how new technology can reconnect us with the natural world whilst demonstrating the power of 5G to a huge new audience"", according to Minister for Digital Infrastructure Matt Warman. The app will be available in ""set locations"" around the UK. Developer Factory 42 said it does not yet know how many locations, but they could include parks, visitor attractions like Kew Gardens and urban settings. Users will need a 5G-enabled device. The other projects sharing the Â£28m funding include one to provide live, multi-angle HD video streams and replays on phones at sporting events; one to allow people to experience exhibits at The Eden Project in Cornwall from their own homes; and one to control the 113 cranes at the Port of Felixstowe in Suffolk. They follow nine other 5G trial projects that were awarded a total of Â£35m in February 2020. Follow us onFacebook,external, or on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external.

NHS staff left 'traumatised' by first Covid waveMore than 700 intensive care staff at nine hospitals were asked about their experiences for a study.Health,"Many hospital staff treating the sickest patients during the first wave of the pandemic were left traumatised by the experience, astudy,externalsuggests. Researchers at King's College London asked 709 workers at nine intensive care units in England about how they were coping as the first wave eased. Nearly half reported symptoms of severe anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder or problem drinking. One in seven had thoughts of self-harming or being ""better off dead"". Nursing staff were more likely to report feelings of distress than doctors or other clinical staff in the anonymous web-based survey, which was carried out in June and July last year. Just over half reported good well-being. Victoria Sullivan, an intensive care nurse at Queen's Hospital in Romford, said she often can't sleep because she's thinking about what is happening at the hospital. Her worst moment was breaking the news of a death on the phone, she said, adding that the screams from the patient's relatives ""will honestly stay with me forever"". ""Telling someone over the phone and all you can say is 'I'm really sorry', whilst they're crying their heart out, is quite traumatising,"" she said. ""Although you're saying how sorry you are, in the back of your mind, you're also thinking: 'I've got three other patients I've got to go and see, the infusions need drawing up, and meds need to be given and a nurse needs support'. ""The guilt is just too much."" This video can not be played WATCH: ICU hospital staff ""scared, sad, petrified, worried"" In the study, which has been published online but has not yet been peer-reviewed: 291 (41%) were doctors, 344 (48.5%) were nurses, and 74 (10.4%) other healthcare staff 59% reported good well-being - but despite this, 45% met the threshold for probable clinical significance for at least one of: severe depression (6%), PTSD (39%), severe anxiety (11%) or problem drinking (7%) The researchers say the findings are, in some ways, not surprising given the pressures ICU staff have faced. Their workload has been relentless, caring for more patients than is ideal and under extremely challenging circumstances. Lead researcher Prof Neil Greenberg said the findings should be a ""wake-up call"" for NHS managers. He said: ""The severity of symptoms we identified are highly likely to impair some ICU staff's ability to provide high-quality care as well as negatively impacting on their quality of life."" Prof Greenberg said it was important to have ""occupationally focused"" mental health care to try to keep staff fighting fit or, where this was not possible, to ensure they got help to access the right sort of care. And he said that, while their work suggested things may have improved over the summer, there were signs the numbers experiencing mental health problems would rise in November and December. 'How long can we keep going like this? About a week' Prof Partha Kar, diabetes consultant at Portsmouth Hospitals NHS trust, said it was ""really, really difficult seeing people battling through all sorts of odds"". He added: ""We've got sickness rates high all around us and colleagues from all specialities, where they're not accustomed to seeing such ill patients, coming out and trying to help. ""Understandably the impact of that on everybody's mental health is not insignificant either... it's such a tough place to be in."" PTSD is an anxiety disorder caused by very stressful, frightening or distressing events. Someone with PTSD often relives the traumatic event through nightmares and flashbacks, and may experience feelings of isolation, irritability and guilt. They may also have problems sleeping, such as insomnia, and find concentrating difficult. These symptoms are often severe and persistent enough to have a significant impact on the person's day-to-day life. Causes of PTSD can include: serious road accidents violent personal assaults, such as sexual assault, mugging or robbery serious health problems childbirth experiences Source:NHS,external An NHS spokesperson said: ""This is an incredibly tough time for NHS staff working on the front line which is why we have invested Â£15m in support, including 38 local mental health and well-being hubs and a service for staff with complex mental health needs, such as trauma and addiction. ""The public can also help to support doctors and nurses by following the 'hands, space, face' guidance to reduce pressure on hospitals and save lives.""

'Discriminatory' mental health system overhauledBlack people are more than four times more likely to be detained under the Mental Health Act in England.Health,"Plans have been announced to overhaul the mental health system - with the aim of making it less discriminatory towards black people. Ministers say changes to how people are sectioned in England and Wales will see them treated ""as individuals, with rights, preferences, and expertise"". Black people are over four times more likely to be detained under the Mental Health Act, relative to population. The mental health charity Mind said the changes ""cannot come soon enough."" People are detained under the mental health act - or sectioned - for their own safety, or the safety of others. How long they are detained for varies - but once detained, they are immediately considered to be ""sectioned"". Use of the Mental Health Act has increased markedly - from 2005/6 to 2015/16, the number of people detained in hospital increased by 40%. NHS data for England shows there were at least 50,893 new detentions under the Mental Health Act in 2019/20 - but the overall total will be higher as not all providers submitted data. Of those detentions, 5,336 people were black or black British. The data also shows that in 2019/20 there were 321 detentions per 100,000 population for people who were black or black British - while there were 73 detentions per 100,000 for white people. With the act disproportionately used against black people, the reforms will see a Patient and Carers Race Equality Framework introduced across all NHS mental health trusts - which the government describes as a practical tool to improve the outcome for BAME communities. What ministers call ""culturally appropriate advocates"" will also be developed, so patients from all ethnic backgrounds can be supported. 'I was sectioned and no one told me what was going on' BAME people's mental health 'forgotten about' First lockdown had 'major effect' on mental health ""We need to bring mental health laws into the 21st Century,"" said Health Secretary Matt Hancock. ""I want to ensure our health service works for all, yet the Mental Health Act is now 40 years old. ""This is a significant moment in how we support those with serious mental health issues, which will give people more autonomy over their care and will tackle disparities for all who access services - in particular for people from minority ethnic backgrounds."" The reforms will also ensure that autism or a learning disability cannot be a reason for detaining someone under the act. In future, a clinician will have to identify another psychiatric condition to order their detention. This video can not be played What is it like to be sectioned? The current Mental Health Act dates from 1983 and the aim of these reforms, which are widely supported, is to give people greater say over their care and to rebalance the system between the state and the individual. Among the recommendations are plans to introduce statutory advance choice documents which will allow people to express their preferred treatment before they reach a crisis and need hospitalisation. ""This is just the beginning of what is now a long overdue process,"" said Sophie Corlett, director of external relations at the mental health charity Mind. ""At the moment, thousands of people are still subjected to poor, sometimes appalling, treatment, and manyâ¯will live with the consequences far into the future.â¯ ""Our understandingâ¯ofâ¯mental health has moved onâ¯significantlyâ¯in recentâ¯decadesâ¯but our laws areâ¯rootedâ¯in the 19thâ¯Century."" The recommendations, set out in a government White Paper, build on the proposals from an independent review of the act, which was ordered by then prime minister Theresa May in October 2017 and which published its conclusions in December 2018. Ministers intend to publish a Mental Health Bill in 2022, following a consultation on their plans.

"School meals must 'urgently' improve - ministerIt comes after footballer Marcus Rashford said images of food parcels online were ""not good enough"".UK","England and Man Utd footballer Marcus Rashford is a high-profile campaigner for children on free school meals and said the PM had assured him ""he is committed to correcting the issue"" A mother who posted a photo on social media of a food parcel she received has told of the ""sense of sadness"" she felt on seeing what it contained. The mother, who wants to be anonymous, told the BBC: ""As I unpacked that food parcel... and looked at the contents, it felt very sad and depressing."" Chartwells, the firm which supplied the parcel, has apologised. The education secretary said schools will be able to offer vouchers rather than food parcels from next week. Gavin Williamson told the education select committee on Wednesday that he was ""absolutely disgusted"" by the photo of the food parcel's contents, and that his department had made it clear ""this sort of behaviour is just not right [and] will not be tolerated"". He said the government would ""support any school that needs to take action"" and ""name and shame those that are not delivering against the standards"" set by the Department for Education. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer challenged Boris Johnson on online images of the ""disgraceful"" food parcels during Wednesday's Prime Minister's Questions (PMQs). What free school meals are children supposed to get? School food firm apologises after Rashford intervenes The PM insisted the government had ""massively increased the value of what we're providing"" in the form of anotherÂ£170m in the winter grant scheme, Â£220m for holiday activities and food programme, as well as the rollout of the national voucher scheme. He expressed his gratitude to the footballer Marcus Rashford - a high-profile campaigner for children on free school meals who shared images of some parcels online - for highlighting the issue. Speaking to MPs on the Commons Liaison committee on Wednesday afternoon, Mr Johnson said the free school meals pictured online do not reflect government guidance, adding it was a ""scandal and a disgrace that some companies are trying to get away with the provision that they're offering"". The PM added that it was the decision of the schools on whether or not to have vouchers or food parcels, saying that about 75% opt for vouchers but that some schools wish to continue to support caterers. Mr Rashford, who has met with Chartwells andspoke to Mr Johnson earlier,external, called for a ""full major review"" of the free school meal system. In a Twitter thread on Wednesday,,externalMr Rashford said many vulnerable children had been helped during the pandemic ""thanks to the efforts of individuals, businesses, charities, educators, and government"". But he added: ""It's 2021. Our eyes are open. Now is the time for a full major review of the Free School Meal system."" Food parcels have been sent to pupils in England who would normally be eligible for free school meals while schools are closed during the coronavirus lockdown. The national voucher scheme providessupermarket vouchers through an online portal. The government had previously used this scheme duringthe first lockdown. A row broke out after the mother, using the online name Roadside Mum, posted a photo on Twitter of two carrots, two potatoes, a tin of baked beans and a small range of other food items, which she calculated to have cost about Â£5. The post prompted others to complain about the quality and quantity of the food they had received in similar parcels. The mother, who is disabled, had thought it was supposed to last 10 school days and should have been worth Â£30. ""Public funds were charged Â£30. I'd have bought this for Â£5.22,"" said Twitter user Roadside Mum of the parcel she received She told BBC Breakfast: ""As I unpacked that food parcel in my living room and looked at the contents, it felt very sad and very depressing. ""One of my children came in and saw me laying this out on the floor, and I said I was going to picture it because it didn't look like a lot. ""I could see the child's realisation that this is what I've been given to eat for a week and the sense of sadness. ""Where has the rest of the food gone? This is meant to be a week's food. Why is it so mean?"" Lockdown meals teacher restarts deliveries Inside Rashford's campaign to tackle child hunger 'I remember going to bed with hunger pains' Chartwells, the company that provided the parcel, said it was actually only intended to last one school week and had cost Â£10.50 for food, packing and distribution. In a further statement posted on Wednesday,external, the firm, which is owned by Compass group, said it had ""fully investigated"" its food parcels provision in the last few hours. It apologised for those parcels that did not meet the firm's high standards, and committed to refunding the costs. It added that from Monday, the lunches would be enhanced to reflect the Department for Education's additional allowance of Â£3.50 per week per child. The company has since said,externalthat it will add breakfast free of charge into the food parcels from 25 January, and will continue to do so while schools are closed. It will include bread, butter, yoghurts, juice, milk, oats and fruit, it said. This video can not be played Jack Monroe: Free school meals ""replaced with a poverty picnic"" Meanwhile, some parents in London said they received a pot of flour and instructions on how to bake eight bread rolls in a food parcel from Pimlico Academy. ""It's very humiliating,"" one parent toldPolitics Home.,external""Why would you decide for us? Why not give us the money?"" Future Academies, which runs the school, told the BBC it had asked its caterers to improve the quality of its food parcels. Impact Food Group, the suppliers, said the pot contained ""bread mix"" and the only extra ingredient needed was water. The intention was to help parents create ""an interactive cooking experience"" with their children and to help with some food education at home, he said. The academy chain has said its own voucher scheme would start on 18 January. Rachel said she was not 'impressed' with the amount of food in one parcel she received Rachel Rodgers, a mother of three children aged 14, eight, and five, said she was not ""impressed"" with the amount of food provided in a parcel for her youngest child. Rachel, from Essex, says: ""I got so much more with the vouchers. I always looked for meat and vegetables on offer at the supermarket, so I made the vouchers stretch even more. ""What am I supposed to do with one potato?"" Rachel, who receives food parcels for her two youngest children and a voucher for her eldest, says it would have been ""nice to get a little more"" food, adding that ""even sandwich meat would have been good"". One mother said she was 'disappointed' by the food parcel she received for her two children, who are at secondary school One mother of three says she was ""disappointed"" by the contents of food parcels. The mum, who does not want to be identified, says the food box she received for two of her children at secondary school contained sliced frozen bread ""[which] did not stay fresh""; two slices of cheese that [were] ""hard and taste disgusting"", as well as beans, tinned tomatoes, apples, pasta and potatoes. She says her youngest child, who is in primary school, received a parcel of five rolls ""that were going stale"", grated cheese, three packs of crackers, five yoghurts and packs of biscuits. The mother adds: ""It is a good job I already had some cheese and bacon in the fridge, because this is disheartening. ""We have never had support feeding our children through the holidays even when I was young. We need help now."" The initial social media images of food parcels drew widespread criticism. Becca Lyon, head of child poverty campaigns at Save the Children, said the charity welcomed the return of the voucher scheme - adding that theproblems some families had with the vouchers last yearshould not be repeated. Anne Longfield, the children's commissioner, called on companies to provide ""real food and real amounts that will really help families"". Meanwhile, Dr Max Davie, of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said the contents of the food parcels were ""not nutritionally sufficient for children and young people"". Parcels should contain food items rather than pre-prepared meals due to food safety considerations Minimise the fridge and freezer space that schools and families will need to store foods Contain items which parents can use to prepare healthy lunches for their child/children across the week Not rely on parents having additional ingredients at home to prepare meals Not contain items restricted under the school food standards Cater for pupils who require special diets, for example, allergies, vegetarians or religious diets - schools should ensure there are systems in place to avoid cross-contamination Contain appropriate packaging sizes for household use, rather than wholesale sizes Source:Department for Education,external In Wales, the provision of free school meals during the holidays has been extended by a year, and the Northern Ireland Executive made a pledge in November to provide free school meals in holidays until Easter 2022.

Plastic bag charge to double in Scotland from AprilThe increase is to further discourage shoppers from buying single-use plastic bags.Scotland,"The minimum cost of carrier bags in Scotland is set to double to 10p from 1 April. The Scottish government has said it is important to increase the charge periodically to encourage the use of reusable options instead. Environment Secretary Roseanna Cunningham said the move was to deter the use of single-use plastic bags. The 5p charge was introduced in 2014, with plastic bag usage dropping by 80% by the following year. Plastic or paper: Which bag is greener? Reality Check: Where does the plastic bag charge go? Could this 'biodegradable bag' cut plastic pollution? Ms Cunningham said: ""Thanks to the people of Scotland, the introduction of the charge has been successful in reducing the amount of single-use carrier bags in circulation. ""While the 5p bag charge was suitable when it was first introduced, it is important that pricing is updated to ensure that the charge continues to be a factor in making people think twice about using a single-use carrier bag."" Some retailers have pledged to donate their carrier bag charges to good causes, with Â£2.5m raised in 2019. Prior to the charge being introduced in 2014, 800 million single use carrier bags were issued annually in Scotland. By 2015 this fell by 80% with the Marine Conservation Society noting in 2016 that the number of plastic carrier bags being found on Scotland's beaches dropped by 40% two years in a row with a further drop of 42% recorded between 2018 and 2019. Keep Scotland Beautiful chief executive Barry Fisher said: ""Since 2014 the single use carrier bag charge has significantly helped reduce the number of bags being given out by retailers - saving thousands of tonnes of single use plastic realising a significant net carbon saving and reducing the chances of these items becoming littered. ""However, there is still an opportunity to challenge individual behaviours and improve consumer awareness which the doubling of the charge will help do. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the Scottish government is looking into creating an exemption on the bag charge for certain deliveries and collections, as was the case last year at the onset of the pubic health crisis.

The data also shows that in 2019/20 there were 321 detentions per 100,000 population for people who were black or black British - while there were 73 detentions per 100,000 for white people. With the act disproportionately used against black people, the reforms will see a Patient and Carers Race Equality Framework introduced across all NHS mental health trusts - which the government describes as a practical tool to improve the outcome for BAME communities. What ministers call ""culturally appropriate advocates"" will also be developed, so patients from all ethnic backgrounds can be supported. 'I was sectioned and no one told me what was going on' BAME people's mental health 'forgotten about' First lockdown had 'major effect' on mental health ""We need to bring mental health laws into the 21st Century,"" said Health Secretary Matt Hancock. ""I want to ensure our health service works for all, yet the Mental Health Act is now 40 years old. ""This is a significant moment in how we support those with serious mental health issues, which will give people more autonomy over their care and will tackle disparities for all who access services - in particular for people from minority ethnic backgrounds."" The reforms will also ensure that autism or a learning disability cannot be a reason for detaining someone under the act. In future, a clinician will have to identify another psychiatric condition to order their detention. This video can not be played What is it like to be sectioned? The current Mental Health Act dates from 1983 and the aim of these reforms, which are widely supported, is to give people greater say over their care and to rebalance the system between the state and the individual. Among the recommendations are plans to introduce statutory advance choice documents which will allow people to express their preferred treatment before they reach a crisis and need hospitalisation. ""This is just the beginning of what is now a long overdue process,"" said Sophie Corlett, director of external relations at the mental health charity Mind. ""At the moment, thousands of people are still subjected to poor, sometimes appalling, treatment, and manyâ¯will live with the consequences far into the future.â¯ ""Our understandingâ¯ofâ¯mental health has moved onâ¯significantlyâ¯in recentâ¯decadesâ¯but our laws areâ¯rootedâ¯in the 19thâ¯Century."" The recommendations, set out in a government White Paper, build on the proposals from an independent review of the act, which was ordered by then prime minister Theresa May in October 2017 and which published its conclusions in December 2018. Ministers intend to publish a Mental Health Bill in 2022, following a consultation on their plans.

Covid: Online education 'patchy and inconsistent',"This video can not be played 'Given the choice, I think they'd rather be back in the classroom', said Nick Langston Online education is ""patchy and inconsistent"" and there should be a clearer national approach, according to Wales' future generations commissioner. Sophie Howe said the Welsh Government should do more to ensure consistency of learning by schools across Wales. Schools areset to remain closeduntil at least the end of January, with teaching delivered remotely. The Welsh Government said it had been commended for the way it had provided devices to access online learning. Ms Howe said ""real leadership from the top"" was needed along with clarity about what parents should expect regarding ""how many hours, what type of work, how we should be using digital platforms, and indeed how best to support parents to facilitate all of that"". She said a chief digital officer for education was needed. ""What we're seeing at the moment is parents having to compete with multiple different platforms. I think I counted about six or seven that my four children are on,"" she said. ""It does seem that some schools are offering face-to-face virtual lessons, some are just offering worksheets and so on."" The Welsh Government said it had successfully providedlaptops and MiFi devices to familieswho were struggling to access online learning, plus guidance and training for teachers. It confirmed there was no legal duty on schools in Wales to deliver a minimum amount of online teaching after schools in England were told it would be mandatory to deliverthree to five hours of remote learningper day - a duty overseen by school inspectors. The Welsh Government said the inspectorate, Estyn, was not formally overseeing the delivery of remote learning in Wales but had been part of a Blended Learning Working Group which also involved regional education consortia and local authorities. Guidance to schools says pupils should generally receive ""the duration of learning time they would receive were they in school"". Lisa and Nick Langston have been helping their children with home schooling Children home-schooling 'denied laptops by schools' Q&A: What are Wales' lockdown rules? Nick Langston, a professional guitarist from Chepstow, Monmouthshire, and his wife Lisa, a solicitor, are helping home school their two young children. Their eight-year-old son is required to complete one piece of literacy and numeracy, and another topic every day which is set online and then sent back to teachers to be marked. Nick said: ""We were concerned initially that we'd be expected to be teaching the kids for six hours a day, which would have been quite a challenge. ""But, actually, the big focus seems to be on making sure the kids' reading and writing keep going, and their numbers keep going, and then they've given us flexibility."" Lisa said the communication from the primary school has been ""fantastic"". She said: ""They respond really quickly which is great because obviously they've got a lot of children to respond to, and they're very positive in their comments and encouraging and pushing the children along. ""There's a real interaction between the kids and the teacher which has been great."" Henry said he's found completing school work from home ""good"" but sometimes ""stressful"" Nick and Lisa's eight-year-old son Henry said he found doing his school work at home ""good"" although it could be ""a bit stressful doing it"". He said he had been completing maths, spelling and work learning about the forest, at home. ""It gets my brain working through the day. ""But it has been a bit annoying because everybody is talking and you have to concentrate to do work,"" he said. Jackson and his younger sister Mari have been learning at home for A-levels and GCSEs Meanwhile 17-year-old A-level student Jackson said the lesson work he is set was ""not that different"" to when he was in school. ""It varies for each lesson, ranging from 15 minutes to the entire hour,"" he said. Rhian Lundigran, head teacher at Glan yr Afon and Bryn Hafod primary schools in Llanrumney, Cardiff, said it is easier to plan for remote learning now schools know they will be closed for some weeks. Having handed out 300 devices and 200 dongles during the first lockdown, a further seven were distributed last week to families whose circumstances had changed. She said a mix of daily ""meets"" with the class teacher, along with setting tasks online, works well. ""We're very aware of children's wellbeing and parents' wellbeing,"" she added. ""We're also aware that teachers have their own children trying to learn at home while they're working at home, and it's trying to get that balance between wellbeing and learning online. ""Every school is different, every family has different circumstances and there are strengths I'm sure in many different schools, but to share that good practice would be really effective and would reduce the workload of teachers."" ""Face-to-face learning is the best way and anything that can replicate that, remotely, needs to be the focus,"" said Plaid education spokesperson Sian Gwenllian The huge challenges of home-schooling BBC's bilingual lessons for home-schooling parents Plaid Cymru said the Welsh Government needed a plan to get rid of a ""postcode lottery"" of provision and the government should provide clear expectations for teachers to address inconsistencies ""from school to school and pupil to pupil"". ""There should be a clearer expectation on schools [and] teachers coming from the Welsh Government that remote learning has to be ramped up. There should be national expectations set out that does include remote learning,"" said education spokesperson Sian Gwenllian. ""Obviously, face-to-face learning is the best way and anything that can replicate that, remotely, needs to be the focus - so live streaming of lessons and individual lessons between smaller groups."" The Welsh Conservatives said the situation had improved since schools were closed in March but the picture was still ""not very consistent"". Estyn boss Meilyr Rowlands: Distance learning provision ""becoming less variable than during the first lockdown"" ""I think there's a case to be made for a minimum number of hours, but without being prescriptive about what those hours are used for because teachers are best placed to know how individual classes would work,"" said the party's education spokesperson Suzy Davies. She said the regional education consortia should have a role in monitoring the quality of provision and ""supervising and supporting teachers"". The schools watchdog Estyn said provision was becoming ""less variable"" than during the first lockdown. Meilyr Rowlands, chief inspector of education, said education staff had risen to the challenges posed by the pandemic. ""The periods of learning from home has meant that all schools have had to think afresh about how pupils learn and how face-to-face teaching can best promote resilience and independent learning skills,"" he said. ""Overall, the education and training system is now better prepared for distance learning and the provision is becoming less variable than during the first lockdown. ""As a result, schools and other providers are planning to implement more extensive programmes of live-streamed and pre-recorded lessons for learners during the current lockdown period."" Most children will be learning from home until at least February half-term, unless there is a big drop in Covid cases Eithne Hughes, director of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) Cymru, said schools were now in a far better position than at the outset of the pandemic to deliver remote teaching. ""We will also be talking to the Welsh Government about how schools can be best supported in order to ensure this provision is of the highest quality,"" she said. ""However, the success or otherwise of remote education is not entirely within their power. ""Some children will not have access to a laptop or tablet, or will have to share access, or will not have a stable internet connection, or a quiet space in their homes.""

Senior Tories call for reset in UK's China policy,"Senior Conservatives have called for a ""reset"" in UK policy towards China, including sanctions against officials responsible for human rights abuses. The Conservative Human Rights Commission demanded a rethink in relations after hearing evidence of abuses from torture to slavery. It urged the UK to work with allies to respond to China's behaviour. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab has said the UK plays a ""leading role"" in highlighting abuses. The Commission made the recommendations in a new report endorsed by two former Conservative foreign secretaries, Lord Hague and Sir Malcolm Rifkind. It adds to growing internal pressure on the government from Conservative circles to harden its line on China. UK tightens rules on using Uighur-picked cotton Twitter deletes China's Xinjiang women tweet China expands its Uighur detention camps - report The Commission says it has heard first-hand evidence of human rights violations in China from dissidents, lawyers, and human rights campaigners. This included violations of media freedom, clampdowns on Uighur Muslims, modern day slavery, and the establishment of an ""Orwellian surveillance state,"" it added. The group said this showed the need for a ""comprehensive review"" of China policy across UK government departments. It also called for the UK to diversify its supply chains to reduce ""strategic dependency"" on China and further efforts to highlight rights issues at the United Nations. Mr Raabannounced fineson Tuesday for UK firms doing business in China if they cannot show that their products aren't linked to forced labour in the country's Xinjiang region. In December,the BBC revealed new evidencethat China is forcing hundreds of thousands of Uighurs and other minorities into hard, manual labour in the cotton fields of Xinjiang. MPs and peers are separately pushing for new laws to block trade deals with countries found guilty of genocide, something which for now the government is resisting. Mr Raab told MPs the idea was ""well-meaning"" but it would be wrong to ""sub-contract"" the issue of when to break off trade talks to the courts. The Conservative Human Rights Commission, established in 2005, aims to highlight human rights concerns and keep the issue high on the party's agenda.

Childline sees demand rise in pandemic,"Volunteer Ewa Turczanska said there has been ""a lot more anxiety"" among callers during the pandemic Childline is appealing for volunteers, having seen a rise in demand for its services during Covid-19 restrictions. Since April, mental health counselling sessions delivered to young people in Wales have increased by 13% on average. However the service has also seen a 40% decline in the number of volunteer counsellors across the UK. Concerns raised by those using the service during lockdown include anxiety, low mood, depression, loneliness and low self-esteem. Childline, run by the NSPCC, offers free support and advice to children and young people over the phone and online. It has two bases in Wales - Cardiff and Prestatyn, Denbighshire - along with 10 elsewhere in the UK. Between last April and December, 1,934 mental health counselling sessions were provided to children who said they were from Wales. That equates to a monthly average of 215 sessions - a 13% rise on the pre-lockdown monthly average between January and March 2020. Schools shut to half term unless Covid cases fall Minister to consult pupils hit by Covid changes Here are two examples of calls received in December by Childline: ""I am feeling so overwhelmed and I am scared for my mental health. I am forcing myself to get out of bed and have lost interest in everything. I am scared that I am not going to succeed in life and feel like a freak"" (Boy, 15, Wales) ""I am in a really bad place. I am being bullied online by a group of girls I used to be close with from college. I am terrified about going back to college in January. I don't know what to do anymore and I cannot see things improving for me. My anxiety is through the roof and I don't think people understand the severity of how bad I am feeling"" (Girl, 17, Wales) The real number of service users from Wales could be higher because some opted not to disclose their location. Meanwhile, volunteer numbers have dropped by 40% across the UK. In Wales, the charity had set a target of 174 active volunteers in 2019-20 - but they currently have less than half that number with 78. Vicci Holbrook-Hughes, staff supervisor at the Prestatyn base, said the situation is ""desperate"", with evening and weekend volunteers especially in demand as well as fluent Welsh-speakers. ""It's really serious because the number of children and young people that need to speak to us is increasing, while our number of volunteers is decreasing,"" she said. ""Here in Prestatyn we're down by 50% of our volunteer numbers. ""There is a real problem that we are not able to talk to everybody that we want to. Vicci Holbrook-Hughes said some volunteers are shielding during the pandemic ""A lot of our volunteers are from a vulnerable category and some of them are older, so they had to shield when Covid started. ""Some of them have had to leave because they've got other issues, other conditions or family issues."" For volunteers at the Prestatyn centre, the problems of those young people contacting the service demonstrate the impact of the pandemic. ""I think they're missing everything about their life and how it was before,"" said Sandy Collier, who has volunteered with Childline for eight years. ""It's really affecting their mental health. ""Around six months after lockdown, I can remember one young person saying how they felt that everything in their life had just ended. Child mental health 'collateral damage' of Covid New minister for mental health in cabinet shake-up ""Going to college, being with friends - that had just ended. ""They weren't suicidal, but that's how things felt for them because of Covid and what followed."" Ewa Turczanska, a volunteer with the charity for 15 years, said she has seen a rise in anxiety. ""There has been a lot more mental health problems to do with the stress and uncertainty we're all feeling about the pandemic,"" she said. ""They're missing their normal lives and not seeing an end to it [Covid], that's one of the current themes."" Ms Holbrook-Hughes said the voluntary sector is under pressure urged those who may have considered volunteering to take the opportunity. ""It's a sad reality that we're all [as voluntary organisations] asking for more volunteers and a lot of people are giving all they can give. ""But there are some people there who are just sitting on the edge, unsure. So I would say just, you know, just take the leap and do it."" Staff and volunteers have been given key worker status to continue their work during lockdown.

Three US lawmakers have Covid after Capitol riot,"Bonnie Watson Coleman is one of three Democratic lawmakers to have tested positive since the invasion of the US Capitol Three US lawmakers have tested positive for the coronavirus after sheltering for hours with colleagues during last week's deadly assault on the Capitol. House Democrats Bonnie Watson Coleman, Pramila Jayapal and Brad Schneider have announced their diagnoses. Last Wednesday they hunkered down in secure rooms, seeking refuge from an invasion of Congress in which five people died. Some Republicans were not wearing masks during the ordeal, footage suggests. Video shared by Punchbowl News,externalshows several lawmakers apparently refusing facemasks offered to them. However, CBS pictures from inside the chamber show Ms Jayapal was herself not wearing a mask at one point. Medical experts fear more lawmakers may have contracted the disease, potentially amounting to a super-spreader event at a time when coronavirus infections and deaths continue to rise in the US. The US has recorded the highest number of coronavirus infections (22.6 million) and deaths (367,000) in the world, with no sign of the epidemic abating, despite the limited roll-out of vaccines. This video can not be played When a mob stormed the US capitol Over the weekend, top congressional doctor Brian Monahan told lawmakers and congressional staff who sheltered together from the riots to get tested. ""The time in this room was several hours for some and briefer for others,"" Mr Monahan said. ""During this time, individuals may have been exposed to another occupant with coronavirus infection."" Can Trump be removed or banned from politics? How many arrests so far from Capitol riots? A visual guide to the storming of Congress Mr Monahan did not say how many lawmakers were in the room, but called on them to observe social-distancing measures and wear masks. New Jersey Democratic Representative Bonnie Watson Coleman was the first lawmaker to confirm she had tested positive on Monday. In a tweet, the 75-year-old cancer survivor said she was resting at home with ""mild, cold-like symptoms"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The wearing of masks has been an explosive political issue throughout the pandemic in the US, with some lawmakers openly refusing to don a face covering. A Republican congressman, Jake LaTurner of Kansas, tested positive for Covid-19 after participating in a House vote to reject Arizona's presidential election results on Wednesday. But on Tuesday,Mr LaTurner's spokesperson told the Topeka Capital-Journal newspaper,externalthat he was not in the secure area of the Capitol building where multiple members have since tested positive. On Friday Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), had warned that Wednesday's rioting would probably have significant health consequences. ""You have to anticipate that this is another surge event,"" he told the McClatchy news agency. ""You had largely unmasked individuals in a non-distanced fashion, who were all through the Capitol."" Coronavirus has swept through the heart of the American political establishment during the pandemic.One notable outbreak happened in September last year, when an event was held at the White House to announce the nomination of Amy Coney Barrett as a Supreme Court justice.

'We're on front line' say teachers who want jab,"Parents say teachers at special schools often provide medical care and should be treated like other front-line workers Parents of children with special educational needs and disabilities are calling for teachers in special schools to be vaccinated against Covid-19. Many parents have been told their children cannot attend school because of safety concerns about the virus. Now they want staff in special schools to be prioritised for the vaccine and considered front-line workers. The government said special schools should encourage pupils to attend. Laura cares for son Oscar alone and says their respite support collapsed during the pandemic Staff in special schools are often required to provide personal and medical care for pupils, such as clearing tracheotomies, on top of regular teaching responsibilities. The schools also offer precious respite to many families of disabled children who require a lot of additional care. Laura Godfrey, 33, from Norwich, is mum to nine-year-old Oscar, who usually attends a school for children with complex needs. His return was delayed at the start of term, despite government advice for these schools to remain open. ""His school provision is essential to us as a family. Oscar's mental health suffered a lot in the first lockdown, as did mine. It was a very dark time."" He is currently attending school, but Laura worries it could be forced to close in the event of an outbreak. She is calling for staff at special schools to be given PPE and access to the vaccine, to keep schools open and protect vulnerable pupils. ""They should be recognised and treated as front-line staff and afforded the same protections."" Laura's calls have been echoed by Mark Powell, CEO of the Dorset-based Diverse Abilities charity which runs a special school in Poole. Staff at Langside School in Poole were provided with PPE at the start of the pandemic The school bought its own PPE in order to remain open during the pandemic but said it was ""very difficult and extremely costly"". Mr Powell described PPE as a ""wonderful barrier to prevent the spread of the virus"" but said it had also been ""a devastating barrier to the development and well-being of our pupils"". ""The fact we have nurses, physiotherapists, and occupational therapists on site to form part of our children's school provision means that our school can be classified as a health setting, which are at the top of the list for priority vaccinations."" The Department for Education said the impact of being out of education ""can be greatest on vulnerable children and those with education, health and care plans"". It said special schools should ""continue to welcome and encourage pupils to go into school full-time"" where possible and ""ensure pupils with Send can successfully access remote education"" if they are unable to attend.

Huawei patent mentions use of Uighur-spotting tech,"A Huawei patent has been brought to light for a system that identifies people who appear to be of Uighur origin among images of pedestrians. The filing is one of several of its kind involving leading Chinese technology companies, discovered by a US research company and shared with BBC News. Huawei had previously said none of its technologies was designed to identify ethnic groups. It now plans to alter the patent. The company indicated this would involve asking the China National Intellectual Property Administration (CNIPA) - the country's patent authority - for permission todelete the reference to Uighurs in the Chinese-language document,external. This video can not be played Human Rights Watch: ""It's appalling racial profiling"" Uighur people belong to a mostly Muslim ethnic group that lives mainly in Xinjiang province, in north-western China. Government authorities are accused of using high-tech surveillance against them and detaining many in forced-labour camps, where children are sometimes separated from their parents. Beijing says the camps offer voluntary education and training. China's technology companies deny selling software that can be used to pick out Uighur people from the rest of the population by their appearance ""One technical requirement of the Chinese Ministry of Public Security's video-surveillance networks is the detection of ethnicity - particularly of Uighurs,"" said Maya Wang, from Human Rights Watch. ""While in the rest of the world, such targeting and persecution of a people on the basis of their ethnicity would be completely unacceptable, the persecution and severe discrimination of Uighurs in many aspects of life in China remain unchallenged because Uighurs have no power in China."" Huawei's patentwas originally filed in July 2018,external, in conjunction with the Chinese Academy of Sciences . It describes ways to use deep-learning artificial-intelligence techniques to identify various features of pedestrians photographed or filmed in the street. It focuses on addressing the fact different body postures - for example whether someone is sitting or standing - can affect accuracy. But the document also lists attributes by which a person might be targeted, which it says can include ""race (Han [China's biggest ethnic group], Uighur)"". This video can not be played BBC News visited the camps where Chinaâs Muslims have their ""thoughts transformed"", in 2019 A spokesman said this reference should not have been included. ""Huawei opposes discrimination of all types, including the use of technology to carry out ethnic discrimination,"" he said. ""Identifying individuals' race wasÂ never part of the research-and-development project. ""It should never have become part of the application. ""And we are taking proactive steps to amend it.Â ""We are continuously working to ensure new and evolving technology is developed and applied with the utmost care and integrity."" The patent was brought to light bythe video-surveillance research group IPVM,external. It had previously flagged a separate ""confidential"" document on Huawei's website, referencing work on a ""Uighur alert"" system. In that case, Huawei said the page referenced a test rather than a real-world application and denied selling systems that identified people by their ethnicity. Football star severs ties with Huawei over Uighurs Huawei PR exec quit over Uighur surveillance fears Alibaba says its technology won't target Uighurs On Wednesday, Tom Tugendhat, who chairs the UK Parliament's Foreign Affairs Select Committee and leads the Conservative Party's China Research Group, told BBC News: ""Chinese tech giants supporting the brutal assault on the Uighur population show us why we as consumers and as a society must be careful with who we buy our products from or award business to. ""Developing ethnic-labelling technology for use by a repressive regime is clearly not behaviour that lives up to our standards."" IPVM also discovered references to Uighur people in patents filed by the Chinese artificial-intelligence company Sensetime and image-recognition specialist Megvii. Sensetime's filing, from July 2019,external, discusses ways facial-recognition software could be used for more efficient ""security protection"", such as searching for ""a middle-aged Uighur with sunglasses and a beard"" or a Uighur person wearing a mask. A Sensetime spokeswoman said the references were ""regrettable"". ""We understand the importance of our responsibilities, which is why we began to develop our AI Code of Ethics in mid-2019,"" she said, adding the patent had predated this code. Megvii'sJune 2019 patent, meanwhile, described a way,externalof relabelling pictures of faces tagged incorrectly in a database. Like Huawei, Megvii now plans to withdraw the original version of its patent It said the classifications could be based on ethnicity, for example, including ""Han, Uighur, non-Han, non-Uighur and unknown"". The company told BBC News it would now withdraw the patent application. ""Megvii recognises that the language used in our 2019 patent application is open to misunderstanding,"" it said. ""Megvii has not developed and will not develop or sell racial- or ethnic-labelling solutions.Â ""Megvii acknowledges that, in the past, we have focused on our commercial development and lacked appropriate control of our marketing, sales, and operations materials. ""We are undertaking measures to correct the situation."" IPVM also flagged image-recognition patents filed by two of China's biggest technology conglomerates,Alibaba,externalandBaidu,external, that referenced classifying people by ethnicity but did not specifically mention the Uighur people by name. Alibaba responded: ""Racial or ethnic discrimination or profiling in any form violates our policies and values. ""We never intended our technology to be used for and will not permit it to be used for targeting specific ethnic groups."" Protests have been held across the world to highlight China's treatment of Uighur people And Baidu said: ""When filing for a patent, the document notes are meant asÂ an example ofÂ a technical explanation, in this case describing what the attribute-recognition model is rather than representingÂ the expected implementationÂ of the invention. ""We do not and will not permit our technology to be used to identify or target specific ethnic groups."" But Human Rights Watch said it still had concerns. ""Any company that sells video-surveillance software and systems to the Chinese police would have to ensure that they meet the police's requirements, which includes the capacity for ethnicity detection,"" Ms Wang said. ""The right thing for these companies to do is to immediately cease their sale and maintenance of surveillance equipment, software and systems, to the Chinese police.""

Italy braces for biggest mafia trial in decades,"Anti-mafia prosecutor Nicola Gratteri has vowed to take down ""this asphyxiating 'Ndrangheta"" group Hundreds of alleged members of Italy's most powerful mafia group are set to face justice in the country's biggest organised crime trial in decades. The 355 suspected mobsters and corrupt officials were charged following a long inquiry into the 'Ndrangheta group. More than 900 witnesses are expected to give evidence, and the charge sheet includes murder, drug trafficking, extortion and money laundering. The trial began on Wednesday and is expected to last more than two years. It is taking place in a specially modified building in the southern region of Calabria, which is at the heart of 'Ndrangheta territory. The building, formerly a call centre in the town of Lamezia Terme, has been converted into a fortified courtroom to make space for the hundreds of people likely to attend the proceedings. No mafia trial has been held in Italy on such a scale since the 1980s. Unlike the earlier trial, which ran from 1986 to 1992 and targeted a large number of organised crime families in Sicily, Wednesday's trial is aimed at just one group, the Mancuso family, which forms a powerful section of the sprawling 'Ndrangheta mafia. The 'Ndrangheta are now the most powerful mafia in the country, and the Mancuso clan are said to operate mostly in the Calabrian province of Vibo Valentia. During a recent pre-trial hearing it took more than three hours to read the names of the defendants, AFP news agency reports. They include politicians, police officers, civil servants as well as alleged members and accomplices of the mob. A call centre was converted into a courtroom due to the scale of the trial The highest-profile defendant is the alleged clan boss Luigi Mancuso, 66, also known as ""The Uncle"". Other defendants are said to go by nicknames such as ""The Wolf"", ""Fatty"" and ""Blondie"". The number of accused increases to more than 400 when the 92 suspects who chose a separate fast-tracked trial are factored in. These include Giancarlo Pittelli, a lawyer and former senator for ex-Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia party. Mr Pittelli denies connecting the 'Ndrangheta to the world of politics and other powerful institutions such as the courts. Most of the defendants were detained in pre-dawn raids in Italy, Germany, Switzerland and Bulgaria in December 2019. The 'Ndrangheta are believed to control the supply of huge amounts of cocaine entering Europe from South America and elsewhere. But the lengthy charge sheet for the hundreds of defendants goes far beyond drug crimes. It includes mafia association, murder, attempted murder, extortion, loan sharking, disclosure of official secrets and abuse of office. The lure of mafia money during the Covid-19 crisis The mafia plundered hospitals - then Covid-19 hit ""This trial shows how deeply rooted the 'Ndrangheta is in society,"" Federico Varese, professor of criminology at Oxford University, told AFP. ""It's shocking that you have a criminal group so rooted in the territory you have to put hundreds of people on trial."" The defendants will appear in specially-made cells in the courtroom in Calabria Central to the case is Italy's most famous anti-mafia prosecutor, 62-year-old Nicola Gratteri, who has lived under police protection for more than three decades. He has vowed to take down ""this asphyxiating 'Ndrangheta, which truly takes the breath and the heartbeat from the people"". But Prof Varese has warned that the trial will not mark the end of the group. ""You can throw them in jail but if you don't take away the root causes of why they exist, they'll just reproduce,"" he said.
