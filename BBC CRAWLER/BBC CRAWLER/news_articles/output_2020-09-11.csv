Will Emily be allowed to keep her baby?,"When a mother has a child taken from her by the courts and social services the chances are that her next baby will be removed as well - in the baby's own interests. But social workers may give the mother and her partner a chance to show that the new child will be safe in their hands. ""I hated myself. I was an absolute mess. I wasn't capable of raising children. I physically and emotionally could not look after nine children by myself any longer."" This is Emily's verdict on herself, at the moment when she was at her lowest ebb. Following a court decision, social workers had just removed all nine of her children for their own safety. Emily was alone. ""I had no emotion, no feeling whatsoever. It was like walking around in a daze, all the time, spaced out. I started going out, drinking a lot. It was a way to block it out."" But 18 months later Emily was pregnant again. At just 31 years old, she is about to have her 10th baby. This is her story. Will Emily be allowed to keep her baby? For me the story begins in June 2019, in a glass-walled conference room at Hertfordshire County Council. Some hyper-keen, idealistic trainees are holding a meeting with their consultant social worker from the charity, Frontline. Frontline runs a fast-track training scheme for graduate social workers and these young people are all less than a year into their on-the-job training, not yet fully qualified as social workers, but able to take on a small number of real cases, with an experienced consultant social worker providing support and holding the legal responsibility. They swap stories about their work, debate dilemmas that they have faced, and shoot off theories about what might be really going on, below the surface, in the complex lives of their clients. They draw diagrams on big sheets of paper, which look like family trees but have broken lines showing broken relationships, and notes about the domestic violence, drug and alcohol abuse which scar these lives. One of the trainees, Jemima Ferguson, mentions a nine-year-old girl who's told teachers that her mother has been abusing her. Another, Joe Grabiner, describes the work he's doing with a teenager from a broken home who's had a baby girl. But it's James Shutkever's case that grabs my attention - he's talking about Emily, who has just given birth. In 2017 the Family Court ordered that all nine of her older children should be removed from her care because of severe neglect, James explains. Three of the younger children were adopted, and the other children are in long-term foster care. What will happen now to her 10th baby, a little boy? This story is a 20-minute read You can also listen to Andrew Bomford's 10 weekly reports for the PM programme on BBC Radio 4 With a record like that, some social workers would have tried to persuade a judge that the baby should be removed at birth. But James, and some senior Hertfordshire social workers, feel strongly that she should be given another chance. To protect the identity of the baby I'm going to give everyone in the family different names. I'm calling the baby Harry, and his mother Emily. The baby's father, Emily's partner, is Alex. ""What's your dilemma?"" consultant social worker Rebecca Taylor, asks James. ""How can I build this family's trust in me?"" James replies. ""Do you think they trust you at the moment?"" ""No,"" he admits. ""I think it's a natural thing with parents when children's services become involved in their lives, that they see us as something negative - that we're there to catch parents out, and take children away from them. ""I want to change that narrative, and help them see that I'm actually there to support them, and prevent that from happening."" Emily suffered severe domestic violence at the hands of her previous partner, the father of all her other children. After the relationship collapsed, she was left to bring up the children alone, and as she herself says, she couldn't cope. According to Brenda Greig, a senior Hertfordshire social worker known as a service manager, the children's clothes were not kept clean, they were poorly fed and their medical needs were not attended to. They didn't always go to school, were often left unsupervised and were regularly seen fighting with each other. ""It's understandable that having nine children is not an easy task, and for any parent it would be a challenge,"" she adds. ""But the concern was that Emily did not engage in the support offered. The matter was eventually taken to court, and the decision was made by the court that it was not safe for the children to remain in Emily's care, and all nine children were removed from her care."" James and a consultant social worker are visiting Emily and her baby Harry, who is now four weeks old. What's changed? I wonder. Why are they now prepared to work with her to see whether she is capable of looking after this child, after such a disaster before? ""I think the obvious thing is a big change in what is expected of her,"" says James. There's a big difference between looking after nine children and looking after one, he points out. ""But also I think she's had a really big change in mindset, and her mental health has become a lot more stable. ""And she's also moved away from a really abusive relationship which only disempowered her more, into what she sees at least as being a more mutual relationship, in which there's a much better share of power and control."" First impressions of Emily are that she is a vibrant, funny and strong-willed woman, devoted to her new baby. James asks her how she has changed since her children were taken from her in 2017. ""In 2017 I was in a deep depression,"" says Emily. ""I wouldn't have worked with you. Not like I do now. I engage with the professionals now. Before then I didn't. I probably wouldn't have let you in the house or nothing."" The depression was a result of the domestic violence she'd suffered at the hands of her ex-partner, she says. ""I hated it. Hated life - not the kids but myself. Trying to look after nine children when you feel like that... If I couldn't look after myself, how could I look after the kids?"" Her ex didn't help with childcare and didn't provide any financial support, she says. ""Even feeding nine, and bathing nine, and getting them up for school for one person... It was horrendous. ""I hated myself. I was an absolute mess. At that time I wasn't capable of raising children. Now I see the difference I can admit it, I was completely in denial. ""That's why in the end I couldn't, I physically and emotionally could not look after nine kids by myself any longer."" Emily's baby, Harry, is currently under a Child Protection Plan. It's one of the highest forms of support social workers can provide, short of taking the child into care. It means a child is suffering, or is likely to suffer, significant harm. But for now they are prepared to allow Emily and Alex to bring up their baby, under close supervision. James describes it as a ""managed risk"". ""You need to take into account what happened in the past, because this is what certain people are capable of doing. But equally people have a right to be assessed as they currently are,"" he says. ""Let's talk about what happened before, but let's talk about what's happened since then, and the kind of parents you can be now. I think there's always room for people to change. I think everybody has the ability to change."" Emily believes she has changed. ""I'm happy now, settled down, and chilled out. In a better place now,"" she says. ""I'm in a good relationship. We haven't argued for a long time now. Obviously, we have our disagreements because he annoys the hell out of me sometimes. But things have changed massively."" Now she says she doesn't want anything to get in the way of her being a mum to Harry. Over the summer the social workers have continued to make regular visits to see Emily, Alex, and their baby Harry. Most of the visits are arranged in advance, but they also make regular unannounced visits, sometimes in the evenings or at weekends. It's a way of seeing what is really going on in a family, when they haven't had a chance to prepare. One evening, on an unannounced visit, Alex was found to be drinking. For the social workers this was a big concern. The parents had promised there would be no alcohol in the flat, because it had been a trigger for fights and arguments between them in the past. On their files, social workers had noted seven previous incidents of disputes between Emily and Alex, some of them involving the police. At first, James had tried to get through to Emily and Alex by phone, but when he couldn't succeed he became concerned, and took steps to visit the couple with service manager Brenda Greig. ""It took some time for Emily and Alex to open the door to us, and they seemed very shocked to see us,"" she recounts. ""In our conversation with Alex it became pretty clear that he'd been drinking, although he denied it."" During home visits social workers routinely look around the flat and James found alcohol in the kitchen, at which point Alex admitted it. He had been drinking. James says the incident worried him: ""It made us question what else might be going on in the house that we don't know about."" It led to a series of discussions with Emily and Alex about the need for more openness and honesty. Brenda thinks that the decision not to escalate the matter further did, in the end, improve the relationship between James and the parents. After a year of on-the-job training with Frontline, James has now qualified as a social worker, and a few days later he visits Emily again, together with his new manager, Garth Taljaard, from Hertfordshire's family safeguarding team. ""He was drunk that one time in here,"" she says. ""And just our luck, you lot turn up, as you do. But he doesn't drink very often. My ex was a drunk, my dad was a drunk. I don't like drunk men."" Garth asks her if she is now being more honest with James. She says that she has come to trust him, even though at first she was terrified her baby would be taken away. ""I think our relationship has grown. Because I won't lie to you, I hated you lot. I hated you lot completely. But it's been completely turned around."" Despite the setback, Garth agrees that they should continue to give Emily and Alex their support. ""Sorry for kicking off. I've never been so angry in my life,"" Emily says to James. It's the day after a fight between her and her partner Alex, some of it witnessed by social workers. The parents had been due to attend a meeting with social workers at a council office, when Emily was spotted hitting Alex. He was seen sprawled on the ground in the car park. The argument continued into the building, when social workers had to separate them. James has come to see Emily, to try and work out what happened. But Emily is still fizzing with rage. ""He can't just go off, and not come back for a night, and do what he wants to do,"" she complains. ""I'm not being in that situation, in that kind of relationship, where he thinks he can do that."" James slowly teases out the events of the day before. According to Emily, they had an argument about Alex being out of work and he left the house without telling her where he was going. James hasn't heard Alex's side of the story yet, but Emily says he met up with a friend, who persuaded him to go out and get drunk. ""He literally got that smashed, he passed out,"" she spits out. ""He needs to understand he needs to start bucking his ideas up, and man up, and start being a bit more responsible. I've told him, he does it again, he's out. And I mean it. And he knows it."" The first she saw or heard of him was the following day, outside the meeting with social workers, looking dishevelled. Emily seems torn between venting her frustrations about Alex, and revealing so much about the state of their relationship that the social workers have second thoughts about their ability to jointly bring up Harry safely. ""I've got too much to lose!"" she cries out, at one point. When James suggests to her that Alex might have been acting abusively towards her, she flies off the handle again. ""Don't start stirring things up James, because that's not what it is,"" she shouts. ""I said he can't treat me like this, meaning he can't bugger off for days. Don't start turning this around, like 'abusive'. Because Alex is not abusive at all. To me."" For several months Emily has been attending a course run by the Hertfordshire Children's Services team, for women who are victims of domestic abuse. The course is designed to help her spot the signs of abuse, such as coercive control. Alex has also begun a council-run course, for perpetrators of domestic abuse. But he has failed to attend two of the earliest sessions. ""After everything I've been through, losing my children. And he thinks that he can do that when we are under social services,"" she says. ""Talk about acting like a prat! He could have risked everything. After all the hard work we've done. This is why I'm so angry and so annoyed at him. ""It seems like we move on one step and take two steps back."" James Shutkever and his manager, Garth Taljaard, are meeting Alex for the first time since last week's row. For now, Alex has been kicked out and is living with his parents. It's the first time he's been away from his son since he was born. ""I'm a bit upset with myself to be honest,"" he says. They're sitting in a council contact centre normally used for parents to have supervised time with their children in care. There are comfy armchairs, a sofa, and children's toys strewn across the room. Facing James and Garth across a table, Alex looks far from comfortable. Sunlight streams through a window, dazzling him. It looks a bit like an interrogation. ""I want to be with Emily and I want to be with my son, but I've let them down. ""I messed up and that's it. The end of it. I'm not going to do it again. I hold my hands up. I'm going to be a man about it. ""It was bad decision after bad decision. I didn't think about the boy - that's the thing, right. I've got to make it right now. It's my chance to make it right again now."" After a weekend to think about what happened, Alex seems prepared to take the blame, even though he appeared to be the victim in the fight witnessed by social workers. He knows it was his actions - abandoning Emily and getting drunk - that caused the conflict. And it seems that being separated from Harry has made him realise the impact his actions could have on his relationship with his son. He says he wants to be there for him every day. He doesn't want to be a weekend dad, as he is with his daughter from another relationship. Garth and James question Alex about his use of alcohol. It has been a frequent source of concern for the social workers, who have to continually evaluate the risk to Harry's safety. But Alex has always resisted. ""I'm not saying you're an alcoholic,"" Garth says. ""I'm saying potentially you have a problematic relationship with alcohol."" Under pressure, for the first time, Alex admits alcohol has led him into fights and even a spell in prison. He promises to talk to a drug and alcohol worker. ""It's not that I've got a problem, it's just like the binge-drinking really..."" he says. But Garth lays it on the line. ""If your drinking was a major problem in the future and you weren't doing anything about it, I wouldn't be hanging around going, 'That's OK,'"" he warns. ""Because my job is to challenge you, and it's James' job to challenge you as well. We want the best for you. But ultimately, our agenda is to make sure Harry's safe, loved, and well cared for, and that it's safe for him to be around you."" Garth then says he wants Alex to attend the domestic abuse course regularly - to provide further evidence that Harry will be safe in Alex and Emily's home. And it seems as though the crisis is forcing a change of heart for Alex. He seems ready to agree to anything. He promises to properly participate in the course. ""Just keep going. That's all I'm asking of you. Just keep going,"" says Garth. ""I will do, yeah,"" Alex replies. ""Don't stop going,"" Garth urges him. ""No I won't,"" Alex says. ""Because that will worry meâ¦"" Garth tells him. ""I'll carry on,"" Alex says. After the meeting, James, Garth and I are sitting in the car, reflecting on Alex's promises to change, and Garth says something interesting. ""Families aren't always going to be ideal when we're working with them. Sometimes they're just going to be good enough."" Later the same day, the team holds a Group Case Supervision meeting. It's a monthly meeting to review progress. But this time it is dominated by the recent events. Alongside James and Garth are Mandy Smart, who's been leading Emily's course for victims of domestic abuse, and Ayse Insaf, who's running the course Alex is supposed to be attending for perpetrators of domestic abuse. James discusses the concerns he has about Alex's drinking. ""The worry is that that's what he turned to, to cope with that situation,"" he says. ""And actually, he's in a relationship which might be volatile. How often does that happen?"" ""There's been a pattern of him drinking, and then domestic incidents occurring,"" observes Ayse. ""All the reports mention alcohol, don't they?"" Mandy points out. ""It's a potential risk factor-slash-trigger,"" says Ayse. Ayse says Alex doesn't seem to understand why he's been asked to attend a course for perpetrators of domestic abuse, because he does not accept that he has been abusing Emily. Mandy reminds them that last week it was Emily, not Alex, who was the aggressor. Garth asks everyone to rate the potential risk to Harry on a safety scale of one to 10. One is very high-risk - Garth describes it as ""We should really be in court seeking removal of this child."" And 10 is low risk - ""Why are we involved at all?"" Mandy says: ""A couple of weeks ago, I would have put them probably at six or seven, but now I think I'll probably go down to about four."" ""OK that's quite a drop,"" says Garth. Ayse says she'd score it at five, because it could go either way right now. James says: ""I would have scored much higher, had this recent event not happened and shone some light on what may, or may not, be going on for the family. I think I'd also give them probably a four."" This feels like a big setback for Emily and Alex. There will need to be some serious changes in the next few weeks if they are to convince the social workers that baby Harry is completely safe in their care. ""I've got your report in front of you, so today I'm just going to go through it. And we've also got James, social worker, present to hear the positive feedback."" Ayse Insaf, who's spent several weeks working intensively with Alex on a course for perpetrators of domestic abuse, is smiling. They're sitting in the same room at a council contact centre where Alex was being pressurised by James and Garth a few weeks ago. But the atmosphere seems entirely different. It looks as though the strategy may have paid off. ""You've attended 12 sessions out of 14, and missed two,"" says Ayse. ""We had concerns in the beginning of the programme, but as I said, you've developed your motivation and engagement, so that was really encouraging to see."" Much of the course has involved group work with other men, where they are encouraged to challenge each other's views and behaviour, to re-shape their attitudes to their relationships. ""Since I've done this course I feel a lot better within myself,"" says Alex Alex says he's been using some of the techniques he learned, like meditation, to control his temper. ""I've just been taking a step back and thinking, and not just walking out the house, so she doesn't know where I am, which is going to lead to more arguments. ""And if I do go out, I say, 'I'm going to go out for 10 minutes,' and not just slamming the door like I did that time, when I went out."" James says he seems to be showing a lot more awareness now. Alex says it's all been a big learning curve for him. A few weeks ago Alex did not regard his behaviour as abusive. And even his partner Emily refused to admit it, getting angry with James when he brought the subject up. She was fearful that it would be a black mark against their ability to bring up their baby, and she tried to keep the problem hidden. Alex seems to be showing some awareness of the impact their arguing and fighting might have been having on their son, even though he is only a baby. ""Instead of me lashing out, I think twice about it, because of what effects it can have on my son,"" he says. Ayse picks up the report and reads a section from it, listing all the abusive behaviour Alex admitted to during the course. He nods his head in agreement as she reads. ""So you highlighted using coercion and control, to threaten to leave your partner, using intimidation, making her feel afraid, by using certain looks, actions or gestures, smashing things up and destroying property, emotional abuse, putting her down, making her feel bad about herself, calling her names and playing mind games. ""And you also identified minimising, denying and blaming. So, shifting responsibility of abusive behaviour, saying that she caused it."" James seems genuinely impressed that Alex owned up to all these actions. ""The fact that you're able to list some of these behaviours and actually hold your hands up to it, and say, 'This was me, and I did this, and that was an abusive action towards her,' is actually really big in itself,"" he says. ""Because I think you know, there's a lot of people who just would not be able to say that. They wouldn't be able to sit there and say, 'I've done all these things.' It's a difficult thing to do."" Alex agrees. ""It was hard,"" he says. After the meeting I ask Alex why he agreed to do the course in the first place. ""I'll be totally honest with you. It was just like ticking the box and that's the way I looked at it from the start,"" he says. ""I felt uncomfortable doing it as well. And yeah, I didn't want to be there. That's why I thought it might just go away. But when you've got a child it changes everything. If I didn't have the boy I would never have done this. I would have just swept it under the carpet. ""I wanted to do it for him."" It's the day of the Child Protection Conference, a formal review meeting, chaired by an independent Child Protection Chair, usually a senior social worker who is not involved in the case. They are held every six months and a lot is riding on the decision made today. Emily and Alex want the case to be ""stepped down"" from Child Protection to Child in Need, which means less involvement by the social workers. Both of them are looking very nervous. They have their baby Harry with them for the conference. He's now six months old. In this case, the independent chair is Temah Hibbert. She's writing notes on a row of white boards stuck to the wall. Each board has a heading, drawn up from the Child Protection Plan. The headings are: What are we worried about? Impact on child Strengths Safety Complicating factors Outline Plan Temah homes in on the fight between Emily and Alex observed by social workers. ""I did wrong, I put my hands up,"" says Alex. ""You shoved him,"" Temah says to Emily. ""I did yes,"" Emily admits. ""I shouldn't have done it, butâ¦"" ""It's about how you manage these difficult situations, and that was a difficult situation,"" says Temah. But Temah is relieved that baby Harry was not there to witness it. Emily says she didn't take him with her because she knew there would be a row if she saw Alex that day. ""Phew,"" says Temah. ""Because in that moment you were keeping Harry safe."" The conference hears from Harry's health visitor, from a child practitioner who's been working with Emily to help stimulate Harry's mental development, and also from the family's tenancy officer. No problems are reported. Temah questions Alex about the course he's been doing for perpetrators of domestic abuse. Alex says after he got over his reservations about doing it, he enjoyed the course, and found it helpful. Temah asks all the professionals to make their recommendation about whether it's possible to downgrade this case from Child Protection to Child in Need. ""I feel quite strongly that we can work with you under Child in Need,"" says Garth. ""There's still work to be done yet. Child in Need doesn't mean we have arrived, it just means we're heading in the right direction. I'm really proud of what you guys are achieving, but there is quite a bit to work through, particularly those grey areas that we need to keep managing. So Child in Need is my opinion."" One by one, each professional agrees with the recommendation. But the key decision is Temah's. She also agrees, saying there's no evidence that Harry is suffering, or is likely to suffer, significant harm. She tells Emily and Alex: ""A Child in Need plan is you saying to Children Services, 'Yes we want your support and we're willing to work with you.' Because at any time within that plan, you can say, 'Actually, James, we don't want to have your support any more.' Then there will be a discussion about whether or not they can safely walk away."" But she warns them that although the support is voluntary, it would be a bad idea to reject it, because it would lead to a new appraisal of the likely risk of harm to Harry. ""So the Child Protection Plan is ended today,"" she says. ""Congratulations to you both. Take care, and I wish you all the best."" Emily and Alex look relieved, like a huge weight has been dropped from their shoulders. ""I'm really pleased,"" says Emily. ""We can move forward and try and live a life without the social involved,"" says Alex. ""Without so much social involvement,"" Emily corrects him. It's a sunny day, and Alex and Emily are sitting on a picnic blanket in a park. Harry is cruising around between them, standing up on wobbly legs, trying to grab their drinks from them. They recently celebrated his first birthday. ""He walks when he wants to,"" says Emily. Like everyone else under the coronavirus lockdown, the family has been isolated. It's been difficult for James Shutkever, their social worker, to monitor developments. ""It's the first time we've met up in person for quite a while,"" says James. Under lockdown social workers have been avoiding entering their client's homes unless it has seemed urgent. He's been making video calls to Alex and Emily, and every month or so the team hold a virtual Child in Need meeting with them. ""I can really see the difference in Harry today from when I'm WhatsApping you,"" says James, ""Suddenly he seems like this grown up little boy."" ""He's talking a bit now,"" says Emily. They chat about their routine under lockdown and how they've only now been able to start visiting Harry's grandparents, who have been shielding. ""That's the worst thing about the lockdown for me,"" says Alex. ""Not seeing anyone."" ""And how have the two of you been getting on?"" asks James ""All right,"" says Emily, ""But he's been getting on my nerves."" ""I always get on your nerves,"" Alex says. ""It's just living on top of each other,"" Emily replies. ""Even without lockdown, living in that little flat, it would test any couple,"" Alex says. ""But you know what James, it's not been like it used to be. The arguments we used to have. Even through lockdown it's not like been like that."" ""I think we've done all right - we've made the best of a crap situation,"" Emily says. ""If we can get through this without any issues, then that is a test in its own right,"" Alex adds. He qualifies that it's not been all plain sailing, and that they bicker and row like anyone would in the circumstances, but now he's more prepared to talk about his feelings with Emily. And they both insist that they've learned to be open and honest with James. ""There's no shutter with me any more. There's nothing to hide any more,"" says Alex. ""It's not like before when we wouldn't tell you anything."" ""We're really truthful now,"" adds Emily. On a computer screen, the future of Emily, Alex, and Harry's family life together - with or without social workers - is being decided. It feels like a very 2020 way to resolve things. ""OK, so this is a Child in Need review,"" says Garth Taljaard. ""James and his team have got to the point where they feel that we can give serious consideration to ending the Child in Need plan. So that's what we're looking at today."" Harry is sitting on Emily's knee in one corner of the video conference screen, with a cheeky grin on his face. Alex is hanging back a little, off camera. ""It's been a very, very long journey. There have been highs and lows, I think,"" says James. ""And I do strongly feel today that the people we are speaking to are really quite different people from the people I met the first time I came round, and introduced myself to the two of you."" Some of the safeguarding team in the meeting add their thoughts on how far Emily and Alex have come. ""Before I really knew you both, I did have real reservations, especially based on the history that I'd seen and read,"" says Hannah Rogers, their health visitor, recounting how the parents were not open and honest at first. ""I think a lot of that was the fear that if you tell us anything negative, or you tell us anything at all, then we're going to hold it against you, and you are not going to be allowed to take your baby home."" Hannah agrees with James that the couple are now ""in a completely different place"". Emily seems a little taken aback, and thanks them for their comments. Then Alex starts speaking. ""I think when we gained trust in you, then we opened up. And once we started being more truthful, I found that we got on so much better with all of you,"" he says. ""It was because of the way Emily was treated by social workers when she had her children removed from her, because she had it bad from them."" At this point Emily makes clear that she still deeply resents the actions of the team of social workers who removed her older children. Garth continues by proposing that the family should be referred to the council's Families First team, rather than being left to get on with things completely by themselves. This would mean they'd no longer have a social worker, but instead a support worker to help with practical issues such as employment, education and housing. Alex says he's got a job as a supermarket delivery driver recently, and Emily says she wants support with counselling for her mental health problems caused by the loss of her older children. ""I'm comfortable making the decision, in my capacity as a manager, that we have reached the point where we can end the Child in Need plan,"" says Garth. It takes a moment to sink in. ""Brilliant! Thank you very much! Today is a good day,"" exclaims Emily. ""Thank you to everyone, and to you James,"" says a delighted Alex. ""Congratulations guys, it is really great to hear,"" says James. I ask Emily how she feels. ""Relieved,"" she says. ""Finally! All the hard work, it's paid off. And it's been worth it."" Later, after she's had time to consider, she tells me: ""I'm proud of ourselves really - to get from where we have come from to where we are now."" And she's grateful for the support they've been given by the family safeguarding team. ""I think both of us, with the work that we've had, has helped us be a lot better parents to Harry, without a doubt,"" she says. Emily says her own family is proud of the transformation she's undergone. ""My family even didn't want to get that close to Harry at first, because they didn't know what the outcome was going to be,"" she says. ""But they love him now, and he is adored by all the family, and by Alex's family."" The case has concluded just as James finishes his first full year as a qualified social worker. There will no doubt be many more cases like this one to come. ""I will never forget working with this family,"" he says. ""I've learned a lot about building relationships with people, and I apply that in my practice every single day now with other families."" The experience has confirmed his belief that with the right help and support, people can change. ""It gives me hope for the future,"" he says. For Emily and Alex there will be many more challenges as their baby Harry grows older, but now they will face them as a family, without social workers. Illustrations by Katie Horwich One true story.

UK defence secretary denies plan to mothball tanks,"The Challenger 2 tank has not been upgraded since 1998 UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace has quashed speculation that the Army will mothball all its tanks. Last month,the Times,externalreported military chiefs were considering the idea, under plans to modernise the armed forces. But Mr Wallace told the BBC ""the idea that tanks won't be there for the Army, upgraded and modernised, is wrong"". However, he admitted a government review would mean ""letting go"" of some military equipment to invest in cyber, space and other new technologies. British Army considers a future without tanks Strength of British military falls for ninth year Warning over plans for new Navy aircraft carriers Speaking on a visit to the Middle East, Mr Wallace said there would be a shift to forward-deploy British military forces around the world to protect UK interests and its allies. Mr Wallace said a joint squadron of RAF and Qatar Typhoon jets would be based in Qatar for football's 2022 World Cup. He announced a Â£23.8m investment in a UK logistics hub in the Port of Duqm to support more British army training in Oman, and which could be used to base the Royal Navy's new aircraft carriers. He also confirmed that RAF jets would continue to target the Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria, with 23 strikes against extremist targets since March 2020. Last month, the Times reported on plans to mothball the Army's ageing 227 Challenger tanks as part of the government's integrated defence and security review - described as the most important defence review since the end of the Cold War. Mr Wallace confirmed the review would mean ""letting go of some equipment that isn't serving any purpose or overmatched by adversaries"". He said that would mean investing in new equipment for the RAF, Royal Navy and the Army. But he signalled that any cuts would not be as dramatic as some have reported. That still leaves open the possibility of a reduction in the number of tanks. But Mr Wallace said that getting rid of all of them was not going to happen. ""We're going to make sure we have an armed forces fit for the 21st Century and meets our obligations to Nato and elsewhereâ¦ ""We are not scrapping all the British army's tanks and we will make sure the ones we maintain are up to date, lethal and defendable."" Mr Wallace said Britain also needed to meet the threat of long-range artillery and drones, which have recently been used by Russia against Ukraine to destroy its heavy armour. Ben Wallace said his first duty was to make sure he delivered up-to-date equipment The new port facilities at Duqm will triple the size of the existing UK base in Oman. They will also be used for British army training in Oman. There's been speculation that the Army could switch its training for tanks from Canada to the Gulf state. While in Qatar, Mr Wallace also visited the US-led coalition headquarters co-ordinating the air campaign against the group calling itself the Islamic State. Despite IS losing most of its territory in Iraq and Syria, Mr Wallace said the threat was ""not going to go away"".

Teacher beats brother to win Millionaire jackpot,"A teacher whose brother previously won the Â£500,000 prize has gone one better to win the jackpot on Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? Donald Fear, 57, used just one 50/50 lifeline to become the first Â£1m winner in 14 years. Brother Davyth, who teaches geography, appeared on the show in September last year. Mr Fear said his brother was his ""hero and best friend"". ""Other way around now,"" said presenter Jeremy Clarkson. The history and politics teacher's final question on Friday's pre-recorded show was: ""In 1718, which pirate died in battle off the coast of what is now North Carolina?"" The options were Calico Jack, Blackbeard, Bartholomew Roberts, and Captain Kidd. 'It was Ocean's Eleven with middle-class people' Millionaire teacher is 'school sensation' Ask The Host: Does Millionaire's new lifeline work? His winning answer was Blackbeard. Mr Fear, who lives in Telford, said he had taught piracy to a group of Year 8 students about eight years ago, and remembered the date of 1718. ""I'm a dates man,"" Mr Fear said. ""You don't be a history teacher for 33 years without knowing a few dates, and the date 1718 and Blackbeard leapt out at me instantly."" Clarkson expressed his amazement at the history teacher's knowledge throughout his run of 15 correct answers. ""It's like sitting next to the internet in a pink shirt,"" he said, describing him as ""an encyclopaedia with a moustache"". Mr Fear is the sixth million-pound winner in the show's 22-year history. After his win, the father of four celebrated by going on a caravan holiday along the Northumberland coast with his wife of 33 years, nurse Debs. And his elder brother Davyth has also been part of his celebrations. ""He is so pleased for me,"" said Mr Fear. ""We went to spend a night in a hotel with our wives last week and got absolutely plastered and he kept poking me saying how pleased and how overjoyed he was by it."" Mr Fear said he wanted to give at least 70% of his winnings to his family and spend the rest on a ""comfortable retirement"". And that retirement is due to begin soon - since winning the jackpot, he has resigned from Haberdashers' Adams Grammar school in Newport, Shropshire. But he said: ""The rules are you have to go at the end of a term. ""Actually, I never investigated the possibility of whether it would be possible not to go back at all - but how unfair to my A-level students that would be?"" Mr Fear added: ""I was planning to go in two years anyway just before my 60th birthday. ""As it is, I'm going just after my 58th.""

Dozens of people missing in Oregon wildfires,"This video can not be played Drone footage shows homes completely wiped out by wildfires Dozens of people are missing in Oregon wildfires that have displaced tens of thousands of people, Governor Kate Brown has said. She implored householders to stay out of the fire zones despite reports of looting. Oregon's emergency management director Andrew Phelps said they were braced for a ""mass fatality event"" from the fires. The infernos have killed at least four in Oregon and 11 elsewhere. One hundred blazes are now scorching 12 US states. She told reporters on Friday: ""As of now, there are early reports from our state police that there are dozens of missing persons related to the fires specifically in Jackson, Lane and Marion counties."" In pictures: Oregon fires force thousands to flee Smoke from California wildfires turns skies orange False claims about Oregon fires spread online She did not offer further details on the missing persons. The governor, a Democrat, also clarified that 40,000 Oregonians were under mandatory evacuation orders. State officials said a day earlier that half a million people were affected. But Ms Brown said on Friday the higher figure included those who remained at home but had been advised to be ready to evacuate. Ms Brown added: ""I know that rumours of looting are extremely alarming and that it's unsettling not to know whether your home is still standing. ""Let me assure you that we have the Oregon National Guard and Oregon State Police monitoring the situation and preventing looting."" Police in Marion County, south of Portland, arrested two men after a car chase on Thursday for allegedly breaking into and looting evacuated homes in the area. The governor noted that federal aid had been approved, which will help provide additional support in fighting the fires and caring for those displaced. Oregon's forestry department fire protection chief Doug Grafe said on Friday firefighters were still battling 16 large blazes, but cooling temperatures and additional moisture in the air are helping efforts. Beatriz Gomez Bolanos, 41, told Reuters of her family's frightening drive to safety through fires burning on both sides of their car. She instructed her four children to close their eyes as they made their escape. ""Everything is gone. We have to start again from nothing, but we are alive,"" she told the news agency. At least one blaze in Oregon - the Almeda Fire, one of the most destructive in the state - is being treated as suspected arson. A 41-year-old man described by police as ""a local transient"" was arrested on Friday on suspicion of starting a large fire that threatened several homes,reports KVAL-TV,external. But investigators said that arrest was separate from the main inquiry into the Almeda fire, which has been linked to at least two deaths and destroyed hundreds of homes in the towns of Phoenix and Talent. The smoke pollution from the wildfires has left Oregon's largest city, Portland, with the worst air quality in the world, followed by San Francisco and Seattle,according to IQAir.com,external. While natural factors such as strong winds have helped the spread of these massive fires, the underlying heating of the climate from human activities is making these conflagrations bigger and more explosive. Nine of the world's 10 warmest years on record have occurred since 2005, and the UN warned this week that the five years from 2016 until this year will very likely be the hottest such period yet recorded. Both Oregon and California have warmed by more than 1C since 1900. The sustained warmth has seen six of the 20 largest fires on record in California all occur this year. In Oregon, the spate of fires has burned nearly twice the average annual losses in just the past week. In California, a prolonged drought over the past decade has killed millions of trees, turning them into potent fuel for the fires. Mountain regions that are normally cooler and wetter have dried out more rapidly in the summer, adding to the potential fuel load. Climate scientists had forecast that western wildfires would grow in size, scale and impact - but their predictions are coming to fruition faster than expected. A really simple guide to climate change Among the victims in Oregon are a young boy and his grandmother. The pair were killed in a wildfire near Lyons, 70 miles (110km) south of Portland. Twelve-year-old Wyatt Tofte, his dog, and his grandmother Peggy Mosso died in the family car trying to escape the blaze. His mother was found severely burnt. Lonnie Bertalotto, Ms Mosso's son and Wyatt's uncle, confirmed the deaths ina Facebook post,external. ""Don't take anything in life for granted and make the best of everyday,"" he wrote. Mr Bertalottotold the Oregonian newspaper,externalwhat exactly happened remains unclear, but the family believes Wyatt tried to get his grandmother out of the car, but she had a broken knee and was unable to move. An infrared image shows destroyed homes in Phoenix, Oregon: burned vegetation and property appear grey, surviving vegetation is in red Along with Oregon, California and Washington state are the worst affected. Around 4.5m acres - an area slightly smaller than Wales - have been burned, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. In Washington, the state's largest wildfire in Okanogan county caused the death of a one-year-old boy as his family tried to escape the blaze. His parents remain in critical condition. This video can not be played Five ways that show the scale of California's 2020 wildfires In California, the death toll continues to rise. Authorities in Butte County, north of the capital Sacramento, said 10 bodies have been found in the last two days. A 16-year-old boy is among those reported killed in the fire. Another 16 people are reported as missing. The North Complex Fire, which has been burning since 18 August, is among the deadliest in history, the California Department of Forestry and Fire protection reports. The nation's most populous state has seen at least 20 deaths in total from fires since 15 August, when the first series of blazes began, according to Cal Fire, the agency handling the wildfires. Over 3m acres have burned in the last month, the most in a single year according to the Los Angeles Times. Tens of thousands of people were under evacuation orders in the Golden State as 14,800 firefighters continue to combat 28 major fires. Have you been affected by the US wildfires?

Attenborough makes stark warning on extinctionThe naturalist looks at the fragile state of the natural world and how human activity drives extinction.Science & Environment,"This video can not be played Sir David Attenborough met some of the few remaining gorillas in the Virunga Mountains at the time some 40 years ago Sir David Attenborough returns to our screens this weekend with a landmark new production. The tone of the programme is very different from his usual work. For once Britain's favourite naturalist is not here to celebrate the incredible diversity of life on Earth but to issue us all with a stark warning. The one-hour film, Extinction: The Facts, will be broadcast on BBC One in the UK on Sunday 13 September at 20:00 BST. ""We are facing a crisis"", he warns at the start, ""and one that has consequences for us all."" What follows is a shocking reckoning of the damage our species has wrought on the natural world. There are the stunning images of animals and plants you would expect from an Attenborough production, but also horrific scenes of destruction. In one sequence monkeys leap from trees into a river to escape a huge fire. In another a koala limps across a road in its vain search for shelter as flames consume the forest around it. Pangolins are trafficked in great numbers for their scales There is a small army of experts on hand to quantify the scale of the damage to the ecosystems of the world. Of the estimated eight million species on Earth, a million are now threatened with extinction, one expert warns. Humans 'threaten 1m species with extinction' Wildlife in 'catastrophic decline', report warns With a million species at risk, what do we save? Since 1970, vertebrate animals - birds, mammals, reptiles, fish and amphibians - have declined by 60%, another tells us. We meet the world's last two northern white rhinos. These great beasts used to be found in their thousands in Central Africa but have been pushed to the brink of extinction by habitat loss and hunting. ""Many people think of extinction being this imaginary tale told by conservationists,"" says James Mwenda, the keeper who looks after them, ""but I have lived it, I know what it is."" James Mwenda: 'Many people think of extinction being this imaginary tale' James strokes and pets the giant animals but it becomes clear they represent the last of their kind when he tells us that Najin and Fatu are mother and daughter. Species have always come and gone, that's how evolution works. But, says Sir David, the rate of extinction has been rising dramatically. It is reckoned to be now happening at 100 times the natural evolutionary rate - and is accelerating. ""Over the course of my life I've encountered some of the world's most remarkable species of animals,"" says Sir David, in one of the most moving sequences in the film. ""Only now do I realise just how lucky I've been - many of these wonders seem set to disappear forever."" Sir David is at pains to explain that this isn't just about losing the magnificent creatures he has featured in the hundreds of programmes he has made in his six decades as a natural history film-maker. The loss of pollinating insects could threaten the food crops we depend on. Trees and other plants regulate water flow and produce the oxygen we breathe. Meanwhile, the seas are being emptied of fish. There is now about 5% of trawler-caught fish left compared with before the turn of the 20th century, one expert says. Two female rhinos are the last of their kind But the pandemic provides perhaps the most immediate example of the risks of our ever-increasing encroachment into the natural world, as we have all been learning in the most brutal fashion over the last six months. The programme tracks the suspected origins of coronavirus to populations of bats living in cave systems in Yunnan province in China. We see the Chinese ""wet market"" in Wuhan which specialises in the sale of wild animals for human consumption and is thought to have been linked with many of the early infections. The programme is uncompromising in its depiction of the crisis in the natural world, admits Serena Davies, who directed the programme. ""Our job is to report the reality the evidence presents,"" she explains. But the programme does not leave the audience feeling that all is lost. Sir David makes clear there is still cause for hope. ""His aim is not to try and drag the audience into the depths of despair,"" says Ms Davies, ""but to take people on a journey that makes them realise what is driving these issues we can also solve them."" The programme ends in iconic style. We see one of the most celebrated moments in all the films Sir David has made in his long career, the moment he met a band of gorillas in the mountains on the border between the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda. Gorillas face many threats but there is hope for their recovery A young gorilla called Poppy tries to take off his shoes as he speaks to the camera. ""It was an experience that stayed with me,"" says Sir David, ""but it was tinged with sadness, as I thought I might be seeing some of the last of their kind."" The programme makers have been back to Rwanda and, after a long trek, spot Poppy's daughter and granddaughter in the deep forest scrub. We learn that the Rwandan government has worked with local people to protect the animal and that the gorillas are thriving. There were 250 when Sir David visited in the 1970s, now there are more than 1,000. It shows, says Sir David, what we can achieve when we put our minds to it. ""I may not be here to see it,"" he concludes, ""but if we make the right decisions at this critical moment, we can safeguard our planet's ecosystems, its extraordinary biodiversity and all its inhabitants."" His final line packs a powerful punch:  ""What happens next"", says Sir David, ""is up to every one of us.""

New Birmingham lockdown measures after Covid spike,"Restrictions will begin in the second city on Tuesday Households in Birmingham have been banned from mixing in new lockdown measures announced following a spike in coronavirus cases. The rate of infection has more than doubled in the city in a week to 90.3 cases per 100,000. The measures also cover neighbouring Sandwell and Solihull, affecting more than 1.6 million people in total. The restrictions will begin on Tuesday, it was announced at a regional meeting of council leaders. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: ""We never take these decisions lightly but social gatherings can spread the virus quickly and we need residents to abide by the new rules to break the chains of transmission."" Under the new rules, people are banned from meeting others who are not in their household or support bubble, indoors or in private gardens. Â Birmingham City Council confirmed people could still go out to shops, restaurants and other venues, in a maximum group of six from more than one household, but told people to be ""vigilant"". This video can not be played Birmingham residents have reacted to the new lockdown restrictions Council leader Ian Ward said data showed ""the infection rate has risen mainly due to social interactions, particularly private household gatherings"". Following earlier confusion around restrictions for the hospitality sector, Mr Wardtweeted,external: ""To clarify the situation, we have now agreed with government that the household restrictions which will come into force next Tuesday will not affect the hospitality sector (bars restaurants and cafes)."" He said: ""You can continue to go to restaurants and pubs in a maximum group of six so that would allow you to meet another household. ""The reason for this difference is the data and information is telling us it's household gatherings together in one home where they are spreading the virus."" West Midlands mayor Andy Street said the restrictions were not about ""prevention of schools, workplaces, transport"" but about mixing of households. The new rules on household mixing in the three areas will run alongside wider restrictions coming into force in England on Monday, banningsocial gatherings of more than six people. Reaction to stricter lockdown rules in West Midlands Which areas are under local lockdown?,external Elsewhere in England on Friday, it was announced: The government's latest R number is between 1 and 1.2 which means theepidemic is growing again. A study of thousands of people in England found cases doubling every seven to eight days with a marked rise in the North and among young people. Merseyside has been added to Public Health England's list as an ""area of concern""after a rise in coronavirus cases, regional mayor Steve Rotheram has said.

Restrictions in Leicesterwill be eased from Tuesday as casinos, bowling alleysand soft play areas are allowed to reopen. Leeds has been upgraded to an ""area of of enhanced support""following a continued rise in coronavirus cases and Sheffieldhas been added to the list as an ""area of concern"". by Rob England, BBC England data unit Birmingham has one of the highest infection rates in England Birmingham's coronavirus infection stands at 90.3 cases per 100,000 people as of the week to 8 September. The rate has more than doubled from 35.9 per 100,000 the previous week. According to the government's more local data, Birmingham is home to five of the top 10 neighbourhoods with the highest number of positive cases in England. Many of these areas saw spikes in the latest week of available data, compared to the week previously - reflecting the overall trend for the city. Springfield and Hall Green West, in the south east of the city, had the most cases with 42, a sharp rise on the previous full week, when only 11 were recorded. Wake Green East and Moseley Bog, just south of Springfield, went from recording between 0 to 2 cases for the past four weeks, to 29 most recently. Mr Ward said the virus has not ""weakened"", calling it ""relentless"". With 892 cases in the latest seven-day period, he said there had been ""an increase of hospital admissions with Covid-19 and an increase in cases in care homes"". He added: ""If a venue doesn't look safe and you're not asked for your contact details, take your business elsewhere."" Mr Ward also said there were currently no plans to postpone the start of the academic year for university students, with thousands expected back to the city's five universities in the coming weeks. Chief Constable of West Midlands Police Dave Thompson said he understood it had been a ""tough time"", but urged people to act responsibly.

The 22-year-old, who celebrates her 23rd birthday on Saturday, said she had planned to see old friends from her time at university. ""It's frustrating, everybody was just starting to spread their wings and it's all taken away again,"" she said.

Ms Kendle, who graduated from the University of Birmingham earlier this year, said she found the rules ""quite vague"". ""People don't really know what's going on,"" she said. ""It's a difficult line to draw, especially when different parts of the country have different rules."" by Rob Mayor, BBC Radio WM political reporter Solihull and Sandwell are also affected by the new restrictions The new restrictions are designed to stop the transmission of the virus in people's homes which is thought to be behind the increase in cases across the West Midlands conurbation. We'll know if it's working if the infection rate starts to drop over the next few weeks. Health officials have described this as a critical moment in the battle against the virus and hospitals are again starting to see small numbers of seriously ill Covid-19 patients. Police will move from an approach of engagement to enforcement of the rules, but with more than 1.6 million people now covered by these restrictions, there will have to be an element of trust that they can be followed. Abby Stapleton is due to study psychology at Birmingham City University Student Abby Stapleton, 19 and from Coventry, is due to move into halls of residence at Birmingham City University at the weekend and said the rise in cases had made her nervous. ""For the minute it is not too strict, I'm still able to move around for things that are necessities, but I'm nervous over catching it, it is a lot higher than Coventry,"" she said.

Coronavirus testing system 'falling over',"People across England have told BBC News they are struggling to access coronavirus tests. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said last week that no-one should have to travel more than 75 miles for a test, after the BBC revealedsome were being sent hundreds of miles away. But dozens have now reported being unable to book a swab at all. The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said testing capacity was targeted at the hardest-hit areas. A significant rise in demand for testing led the government to reduce the number of appointments available in areas of lower prevalence, to prioritise areas with outbreaks. This in turn led to people applying for tests being directed to centres sometimes hundreds of miles away. R number above 1 as coronavirus cases rise What are the challenges of mass testing? Concerns over PM's mass virus testing plans But last Thursday Mr Hancock pledged to put in ""immediate"" solutions to make sure people did not have to travel more than 75 miles, effective from last Friday. Since then, postcodes entered into the government's booking system return a message suggesting there are no testing centres or home kits available - even if you are an essential worker with symptoms. Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove said he understood it would be ""naturally worrying"" for people with symptoms who could not secure a test in a ""timely way"". He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the testing system was under ""pressure"" because of the spike in the infection rate of the virus. Mr Gove said: ""We are increasing the number of tests. It is the case that the capacity every day is for 370,000 - we do want to do more."" He added that No 10 is working to boost capacity through investment in new testing centres and so-called lighthouse labs. 'Complete nightmare' Melissa, a GP in north-west England, applied for a test for her seven-year-old son on Tuesday after he developed a new continuous cough and changes to his sense of taste. After being offered a test in Sunderland, about 130 miles away, she applied via her local NHS's staff portal - designed to prioritise health staff. But this system directed her first to Telford, almost 100 miles away, and then to London, a distance of more than 200 miles. No home kits were available. ""It was a complete nightmare,"" she said. ""I had to cancel face-to-face appointments with patients, including baby clinics."" Government apologises over Covid tests shortage How do I get a coronavirus test? She added that this had become a common theme in NHS Facebook groups of which she was a member. ""The whole system is going to fall over. ""It doesn't feel like the infrastructure is there to support NHS staff going into winter."" This sentiment was echoed by a psychiatrist in an area currently subject to government intervention because of its high rate of coronavirus. She found that no tests were available after developing all of the textbook coronavirus symptoms, including a cough and a fever. Frances, in Suffolk, tried to apply for a test when her daughter developed a high temperature. She didn't think it was coronavirus but ""the rules are the rules"". She had understood that anyone with a temperature should apply for a test, and was not able to send either of her children to school until she did. ""Their teachers need to be kept safe, their classmates need to be kept safe, we need to do the right thing,"" she said. Frances, like Melissa, was also not able to get a home kit, and when she tried to get an appointment at a drive-through centre was told no test sites were found. ""It almost looks like a glitch in the system,"" she said. Jamie in Chesterfield spent seven hours trying to contact someone using the 119 number after no slots were appearing on the online booking system. His school-age child had developed a new cough. ""It's the right thing to do according to the guidelines,"" he said. Eventually he managed to get a test 50 miles away. Meanwhile in Wales, the leader of Rhondda Cynon Taff council, which is struggling to avoid a local lockdown, said he was ""furious"" about the limited testing capacity. Andrew Morgan said a ""huge effort"" had to be made after learning that mobile testing units in Wales were to be limited to only 60 tests. It comes as a number of different data sources showcases are rising and the epidemic is growingfor the first time since before lockdown. On Saturday, the number of new daily confirmed UK cases of the virus rose to 3,497 - the second day running it has been above 3,000. The virus is still at much lower levels across the UK than at the peak in April, but a study of thousands of people in England found cases doubling every seven to eight days, with a marked rise in infections in the north and among young people. Although cases are rising, the number of patients in hospital remains largely flat at 863. ENDGAME:When will life get back to normal? EASY STEPS:What can I do? A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash There are some suggestions that the problems with accessing tests have happened since schools have returned. Mr Hancock has claimed 25% of people applying for tests are not eligible because they don't have symptoms, although his department did not say where this figure came from. Meanwhile, NHS 111 data published on 11 September reported a rise in calls relating to children with symptoms that would make them eligible for a coronavirus test.

Lockdown restrictions extended to Lanarkshire,"The restrictions affect seven areas in and around Glasgow Tougher restrictions on home visits have been extended to Lanarkshire. People living in the area are not able to meet other households in their homes. Similar measures are already in place in Glasgow, East and West Dunbartonshire, Renfrewshire and East Renfrewshire. The extension to North and South Lanarkshire means the restrictions now cover more than 1.75 million people in the west of Scotland. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon had earlier said that the number of new cases in the region was ""causing some particular concern"". Where are the latest cases? Coronavirus in Scotland - latest developments What are the latest lockdown rules in Scotland? A total of 205 positive cases of Covid-19 have been identified by Test and Protect in Lanarkshire in the past week. This video can not be played Coronavirus: John Swinney on restrictions in Lanarkshire Ms Sturgeon said: ""It is clearly regrettable that these restrictions need to be extended to people living in Lanarkshire. ""I understand that this will not be welcome news for people living in these areas, especially ahead of the weekend, but we must act now to protect people and get more control over the virus in the area."" The restrictions will be reviewed next Friday, while those affecting the five other council areas will be reviewed on Monday. More than 1.1 million people in the west of Scotland were already covered by the home visit restrictions. North and South Lanarkshire have a combined population of more than 661,000 people. There have been 205 positive cases of the virus in Lanarkshire in the last week People living in the areas should also not visit someone else's home, no matter where it is - although those in extended households can continue to meet indoors. People from different households can continue to meet outdoors, and in pubs and restaurants, as long as they follow the guidance. Only essential indoor visits will be allowed in hospitals and care homes, although outdoor visits to care homes will still be permitted. If anyone is identified as a close contact of someone who has tested positive, their full household should self-isolate for 14 days. Public health officials in Lanarkshire hadwarned last weekthat restrictions could be imposed if cases continue to rise. Gabe Docherty, director of public health for NHS Lanarkshire, said: ""Although we enter into these restrictions with a heavy heart, I wholeheartedly welcome them."" On Thursday, Ms Sturgeon announceda reduction in the number of people who could meet, either indoors or outdoors, in Scotland. No more than six people from two different households are allowed to gather together, although children under the age of 12 do not count towards the total. Ms Sturgeon told her daily briefing on Friday that she had asked for advice on whether it would be possible to allow children from more than two households to meet in some circumstances - for example at birthday parties. She said she hoped this could be clarified in the coming days. The planned opening of theatres, live music venues and indoor soft play centres, which had been due to happen next Monday, has also been delayed until at least 5 October.

"Bahrain 'makes peace' with Israel, says Trump","Israel's PM Benjamin Netanyahu and Bahrain's King Hamad bin Isa bin Salman al-Khalifa Israel and the Gulf state of Bahrain have reached a landmark deal to fully normalise their relations, US President Donald Trump has announced. ""The second Arab country to make peace with Israel in 30 days,"" he tweeted. For decades, most Arab states have boycotted Israel, insisting they would only establish ties after the Palestinian dispute was settled. But last month the United Arab Emirates (UAE) agreed to normalise its relationship with Israel. There had been much speculation that Bahrain might follow suit. Mr Trump, who presented his Middle East peace plan in January aimed at resolving the Israel-Palestinian conflict, helped broker both accords. Israel opens tentative new chapter with Gulf Arabs What does Trump's Mid-East plan say on key issues? Bahrain is only the fourth Arab country in the Middle East - after the UAE, Egypt and Jordan - to recognise Israel since its founding in 1948. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he was ""excited"" that ""another peace agreement"" had been reached with another Arab country on Friday. ""This is a new era of peace. Peace for peace. Economy for economy. We have invested in peace for many years and now peace will invest in us,"" he said. This is a diplomatic achievement for President Trump and for his son-in-law Jared Kushner, who largely brokered the agreements with Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates. On returning from a recent trip to the Middle East, Mr Kushner told journalists the Trump administration had ""unleashed an energy positivity"" in the region that was ""quite overwhelming."" White House bullet points suggest how Mr Trump will be framing his international dealmaker credentials for his election campaign: as a harbinger of Middle East peace and prosperity, with more Arab and Muslim countries likely coming on board to normalise relations with Israel. This will allow Mr Trump to deflect attention from the ""Deal of the Century"" that he failed to achieve: Israeli-Palestinian peace. That project was widely criticised as heavily slanted in Israel's favour and rejected by the Palestinians. Focusing outward is the Trump administration's way of telling the Palestinians they can no longer dictate the region's relations with Israel. ""Another historic breakthrough today!"" Mr Trump wrote on Twitter, adding: ""Our two GREAT friends Israel and the Kingdom of Bahrain agree to a Peace Deal."" The president alsoposted on Twitter a copy of a joint statement,externalbetween the three leaders - Mr Trump, Mr Netanyahu and Bahrain's King Hamad bin Isa bin Salman al-Khalifa. ""This is a historic breakthrough to further peace in the Middle East"" that will ""increase stability, security, and prosperity in the region"", the statement reads. The UAE welcomed the latest move. The ministry of foreign affairs said it was ""another significant and historic achievement which will contribute enormously to the stability and prosperity of the region"". However, there was an angry response from Palestinian officials. The Palestinian foreign ministry recalled its ambassador to Bahrain for consultation and a statement from the Palestinian leadership spoke of the ""great harm it causes to the inalienable national rights of the Palestinian people and joint Arab action"". The Palestinians have long relied on a unified Arab response on the issues of Israeli withdrawal from occupied territory and the acceptance of a Palestinian state. Hamas, the militant Islamist group that controls Gaza, said the move ""represents a grave harm to the Palestinian cause"". Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, a special adviser on international affairs for the speaker of Iran's parliament, said it was a betrayal of the Palestinian cause, Reuters reports. There is a backdrop of the regional rivalry between Saudi Arabia and Iran in these diplomatic moves. The decades-old feud between them is exacerbated by religious differences. They each follow one of the two main branches of Islam - Iran is largely Shia Muslim, while Saudi Arabia sees itself as the leading Sunni Muslim power. Why Saudi Arabia and Iran are bitter rivals The UAE and Bahrain - both Saudi allies - have shared with Israel worries over Iran, leading to unofficial contacts. Saudi Arabia's response will be watched closely. There is no indication yet it is ready to follow Bahrain and the UAE. This video can not be played Jared Kushner: ""A new script for a new Middle East"" Prior tothe announcement of the UAE agreement in August- which included the suspension of Israel's controversial plans to annex parts of the occupied West Bank - Israel had had no diplomatic relations with Gulf Arab countries. Last month saw the first official flight from Israel to the UAE, which was seen as a major step in normalising relations. President Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner, who was on the plane, described the UAE deal as having ""the ability to change the whole course of the Middle East"". Bahrain last week said it would allow flights between Israel and the UAE to use its airspace. Mr Trump is due to host a ceremony at the White House in Washington next Tuesday for the official signing of the Israel-UAE agreement. This video can not be played The earlier Israel-UAE agreement made it possible for young people from both nations to meet online In 1999, Mauritania, a member of the Arab League in north-west Africa, established diplomatic relations with Israel - but severed ties in 2010.

There was ""extreme brutality and cruelty"" in the attack, officers said. Four other men are also being investigated by officers in connection with the incident. Police said the girls say they were initially approached by two of the men under investigation, whom they did not know. They were then approached by other men at the party who ""took advantage"" of the fact the girls had been drinking, the statement said.

"Back me over Brexit bill, Johnson tells Tory MPs","Boris Johnson has urged Conservative MPs to back his plan to override part of the Brexit withdrawal agreement. In a Zoom call with around 250 of them, he said the party must not return to ""miserable squabbling"" over Europe. The EU has warned the UK it could face legal action if it does not ditch controversial elements of the Internal Market Bill by the end of the month. And a Tory MP has proposed an amendment to the bill, which would affect trade between Britain and Northern Ireland. Meanwhile, the European Parliament has threatened to scupper any UK-EU trade deal if the bill becomes UK law. Analysis: Despite bitter Brexit row can deal still be done? UK signs first major post-Brexit trade deal Brexit to dominate week ahead in Parliament UK at odds with EU over approval for food exports The two sides have less than five weeks to agree a deal before Mr Johnson's 15 October deadline - after which he says he is prepared to ""walk away"". Informal talks are due to resume on Monday, with the next official round of talks - the ninth since March - starting in Brussels on 28 September. TheInternal Market Bill,external, which will be formally debated in the House of Commons for the first time on Monday, addresses the Northern Ireland Protocol - the part of the Brexit withdrawal agreement designed to prevent a hard border returning to the island of Ireland. If it became law it would give UK ministers powers to modify or ""disapply"" rules relating to the movement of goods between Britain and Northern Ireland that will come into force from 1 January, if the UK and EU are unable to strike a trade deal. The EU says the planned changes must be scrappedor they risk jeopardising the UK-EU trade talks. But the government has rejected this demand, arguing the measures in the bill are needed to protect the integrity of the UK and the peace process in Northern Ireland. Lords' anger over 'hypocritical' Brexit bill Kuenssberg: Brexit deal stand-off threatens trade talks How many trade deals has the UK done? In his Zoom call with MPs on Friday, the prime minister did not take questions and a poor signal meant the video and audio connections were lost for several minutes. He called for ""overwhelming support"" for the bill, describing it as ""absolutely vital"" to ""prevent a foreign or international body from having the power to break up our country"". Mr Johnson added that he would not countenance ""the threat of a border down the Irish Sea"". But he said there was still a ""very good chance"" of the UK and EU striking a deal by mid-October similar to that previouslyagreed between the EU and Canada- which got rid of most, but not all, tariffs on goods. BBC chief political correspondent Vicki Young said Tory MPs were ""looking for a sign of compromise"" from Mr Johnson, as they ""simply can't believe the government is prepared to break international law"", but the prime minister ""dug his heels in"". In a column in the Daily Telegraph,external, Mr Johnson accused the EU of reinterpreting the Withdrawal Agreement to ""destroy the economic and territorial integrity of the UK"" and ""endanger peace and stability in Northern Ireland"". ""I have to say that we never seriously believed that the EU would be willing to use a treaty, negotiated in good faith, to blockade one part of the UK, to cut it off,"" he said. Conservative backbencher Sir Bob Neill, who chairs the Commons Justice Committee, said he was not reassured by the prime minister's Zoom call. He is tabling an amendment to the bill to try to force a separate parliamentary vote on any changes to the Withdrawal Agreement. ""I believe it is potentially a harmful act for this country, it would damage our reputation and I think it will make it harder to strike trade deals going forward,"" he said. At around the same time as the prime minister was speaking, the European Parliament announced it would ""under no circumstances ratify"" any trade deal reached between the UK and EU if the ""UK authorities breach or threaten to breach"" the withdrawal agreement. Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis has admitted parts of the bill, which would go against a treaty signed by the UK and EU, would ""break international law in a very specific and limited way"". There is unease over this within the Conservative Party, with former leaders Theresa May, Lord Howard and Sir John Major urging Mr Johnson to think again.

England and Wales' contact-tracing app to launch,"A new Covid-19 contact-tracing app will be launched across England and Wales on 24 September, the government has announced. The app will let people scan barcode-like QR codes to register visits to hospitality venues and will implement Apple and Google's method of detecting other smartphones. Businesses are being asked to display QR code posters to support the app. Health Secretary Matt Hancock described the launch as ""a defining moment"". The first version of the NHS contact-tracing app, intended for the whole of the UK, was trialled on the Isle of Wight in Maybut later abandoned. ""We need to use every tool at our disposal to control the spread of the virus including cutting-edge technology,"" said Mr Hancock. ""The launch of the app later this month across England and Wales is a defining moment and will aid our ability to contain the virus at a critical time."" According to the latest figures published by the Office for National Statistics, there werean estimated 3,200 new cases a day in England during the first week of September, compared with 2,000 the week before. Some hospitality venues have already been using their own QR code-based systems for test and trace but are now being asked to switch to the NHS version instead. Universities, hospitals, leisure premises, civic centres and libraries are being asked to display posters in communal areas such as cafes, where people gather for longer than 15 minutes. An alternative system, such as a handwritten register, must also be maintained for visitors who do not have smartphones, the Department of Health and Social Care said. Do I have to give my contact details if I eat out? Covid-19 tracing app is released in NI Scotland's Covid app downloaded almost 600,000 times Welsh Health and Social Services Minister Vaughan Gething said launching a joint app with England was ""the most practical option"". He added that the move reflects ""movement across our shared border"". ""It makes sense to use the same app, working in exactly the same way, regardless of which country you're in."" It has had a long and troubled gestation but the team behind the NHS Covid-19 app are hoping that they've finally got it right at a time when it can make a significant contribution to limiting the spread of the virus. Back in April, an app seemed to be a key weapon in the government's armoury but since Baroness Dido Harding took over the Test and Trace programme, it's been relegated to the ""cherry on the cake"". Around the world there are still doubts amongst those working on contact tracing apps about just how good Bluetooth is as a way of measuring the distance between people. But the fact that pubs, restaurants and other hospitality businesses are now being told they have to do a better job of logging contact details of visitors presents an opportunity. They may now see having QR codes for visitors as a simple way of complying with the rules, and that could encourage take-up of the app. There has been some confusion about whether businesses will be complying with the rules on collecting customer data if they rely on the app. But I've been told that they will be compliant even though the nature of the app means none of the data will be visible either to them or to the authorities. SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? SUPPORT BUBBLES:What are they and who can be in yours? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? TESTING:What tests are available? Scotland launched its own app on Thursdaythat has already been downloaded nearly 600,000 times. The Protect Scotland app informs people if they have been in close contact with someone who later tests positive. Northern Ireland was the first part of the UK to launch a contact-tracing app -StopCOVID NI was officially launched at the end of July. In England, from Monday, social gatherings will be limited to up to six people - in a measure dubbed ""the rule of six"". It hasbeen criticised by some Conservative MPswho have said it should be subjected to more parliamentary scrutiny. Scotland and Wales - which along with Northern Ireland have devolved powers to set their own coronavirus restrictions - also reduced the size of social gatherings to six people from Monday. In Scotland, children under the age of 12 will not count towards the total, and in Wales the rule will not apply to children under 11 and up to 30 people can still meet outside. The new measures followed a sustained rise in coronavirus cases, with over 2,000 positive cases recorded across the UK on five consecutive days this week.

Migrants and Greek islanders protest over new camp,"This video can not be played Thousands of migrants and refugees are demanding more permanent housing elsewhere Thousands of migrants and refugees left without shelter after a fire on the Greek island of Lesbos have been protesting against the construction of a replacement camp. Almost 13,000 people had been living in squalor in the overcrowded Moria camp and are desperate to leave the island. The island's residents also oppose the reconstruction of the camp and have blocked roads to stop aid deliveries. But the Greek army has already begun setting up replacement accommodation. Fleeing Lesbos fire: 'Daddy, are we going to die?' How the migrant crisis changed Europe Families have been sleeping in fields and on roads after fleeing the blaze on Wednesday, as authorities struggle to find accommodation for them. The Moria camp was initially designed to house 3,000 migrants. People from 70 countries had been sheltered there, most from Afghanistan. On Friday, migrants and refugees approached police barriers blocking the road out of Moria camp, holding signs calling for ""freedom"" and opposing the construction of a new camp. There is also strong resistance from locals for a new camp to house them. ""We don't want another camp, and we will oppose any construction work,"" local leader Vangelis Violatzis was quoted as saying. ""We've faced this situation for five years, it's time for others to bear this burden."" By Bethany Bell, BBC News, Lesbos Migrants from the burnt-out Moria camp are staging a protest in front of the police barriers which prevent them from moving to other parts of the island. Singing and banging plastic bottles, they march up and down a stretch of coastal road, calling for the right to leave Lesbos. One person carried a large piece of cardboard emblazoned with the message: ""We don't want food, we want freedom."" Another banner read: ""Moria kills all lives"". The Moria camp held thousands more people than its intended capacity Many local Greeks too want the migrants to leave the island. They strongly oppose plans to rebuild a temporary camp. Sanitary conditions are grim. There's little running water, and washing is difficult. The question of how to deal with the mass arrivals of migrants, mainly to Italy and Greece, has divided the EU for years. Italy and Greece have accused wealthier northern countries of failing to do more, while a number of central and eastern nations are openly resistant to the idea of taking in a quota of migrants. Med's deadly migrant crisis: In maps and charts Protecting yourself from coronavirus in a migrant camp After visiting the area on Thursday, European Commission Vice-President Margaritis Schinas announced that the devastated camp would be replaced by a modern facility at the same location. He has also said that the Commission's proposals for a new pact on migration and asylum, due to be presented on 30 September, will ""put an end to this unacceptable situation"". This video can not be played The BBC's Jean Mackenzie reflects on her experiences at the camp On Friday, Germany announced that 10 European countries had agreed to take 400 unaccompanied minors who had been living in Moria. Thousands of migrants have been left without shelter after the fire German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer said France and Germany would each accept between 100 and 150 of the children. The Netherlands has already pledged to accept 50 andFinland will take 11,external. Talks are ongoing with other states to take part, Mr Seehofer said. Other countries expected to take in children include Switzerland, Belgium, Croatia, Slovenia, Luxembourg and Portugal, according to German reports. The fire at Moria was ""a sharp reminder to all of us for what we need to change in Europe"", the interior minister said. But a group of charities and NGOs have written to the German government saying more has to be done for all of the migrants, not just those minors. This video can not be played Migrants are struggling to cope out in the open ""The shameful situation in the camp and the fire disaster are the direct result of a failed European refugee policy - now the EU must finally help the people affected,""the open letter reads,external. All 400 children have now been flown to the Greek mainland. EU home affairs commissioner Ylva Johansson said on Wednesday that the EU had agreed to finance the transfer of the minors to the mainland and their accommodation. ""The safety and shelter of all people in Moria is a priority,""she tweeted,external. Fires broke out in more than three places overnight on Tuesday, according to local fire chief Konstantinos Theofilopoulos. Further fires left the camp almost completely destroyed. The fires started hours after reports that 35 people had tested positive for Covid-19 at the camp. Authorities placed the facility under quarantine last week after a Somali migrant was confirmed to have contracted coronavirus. Eight of the 35 who tested positive for Covid-19 are since believed to have been found and isolated. Greek Migration Minister Notis Mitarachi said the fires ""began with the asylum seekers because of the quarantine imposed"". Some of those infected with the virus had reportedly refused to move into isolation with their families. He did not say, however, that the fires were a deliberate act of arson aimed at destroying the camp. Meanwhile, some migrants told BBC Persian that the fire had broken out after scuffles between migrants and Greek forces at the camp. As the military begins constructing new tents on Lesbos, Greece has also sent three ships to provide accommodation for some 2,000 migrants. Greek soldiers have set up tents at a disused shooting range The Blue Star Chios ferry, which has capacity to house 1,000 people, has docked at the Lesbos port of Sigri. Two naval vessels have also been provided. But officials have also increased security on the island. Military personnel, riot police and water cannon have arrived at the scene. On a car park outside a supermarket on Thursday, hundreds of migrants, including families with small children, waited for bottled water and food to be distributed. ""There is no food, no milk for the baby,"" Congolese migrant Natzy Malala, who had a newborn infant and an eight-year-old girl, told Reuters news agency. Child migrants sleep in pens at Lesbos port.

"Wales' mask rule 'to get ahead of gathering storm'People are warned they face ""more draconian measures"" if they do not follow the new rules.Wales politicsComments","This video can not be played First Minister Mark Drakeford says he is confident there will be ""good levels of compliance"" People in Wales must wear face masks in shops and other indoor public spaces from Monday as coronavirus cases rise. First Minister Mark Drakeford said the change was because 20 people in every 100,000 in Wales now had Covid-19, asthe UK infection R number rose to 1.2. Indoor meetings of more than six from an extended household will be illegal from Monday, with fines in place. It comes as,externalto avoid followingCaerphilly into a local lockdown. The Welsh Government said the face mask rule would not apply to children aged under 11. Where do I have to wear a face covering now? England and Wales' contact-tracing app to launch R number goes above 1 as coronavirus cases rise Mr Drakeford warned flouting face covering restrictions could face a fine of Â£1,920. He said curfews and the restriction of alcohol sales were among measures that could now be taken. The new restriction will apply in pubs and restaurants, as well as private homes, meaning groups of six must be part of the same extended household. He said most people had complied with social distancing rules but ""a small minority have not done so"". New powers would allow local authorities to close premises or stop events happening on public health grounds. ""These powers will enable local authorities to move quickly to respond to outbreaks of the virus in their areas, for example where a number of cases are linked to a particular premise or as a preventative measure, where there is a high risk of outbreak,"" Mr Drakeford said. Charlotte Harding lives in Ferndale in the Rhondda with husband Richard and sons Ethan, 8, and Harrison, 6 Charlotte Harding, a mother of two, has had to cancel her son's birthday meal because of Wales' new rules. ""We are due to go the Sunday after next to have a family meal for my son's birthday. That won't go ahead now,"" she said. ""With three families coming together, that's not going to be a possibility. The boys are going to be upset as we won't be able to see our niece, we won't be able to see their nans. ""I have a lot of friends whose households are made up of six people so it is going to be a struggle for lots of families. ""All those little anxieties I had before the lockdown are back. I am a bit worried about not being able to see my family, the children not being able to see their grandparents. That's going to be hard again"". The first minister said there was ""a short window to get ahead of the gathering storm"" of coronavirus. Mr Drakeford said that following the rules would help avoid ""more draconian measures"". Public Health Wales data shows there have been no deaths with coronavirus in Wales in September Mr Drakeford said the ""hotspot areas"" of Caerphilly county, Merthyr Tydfil and Rhondda Cynon Taff were being monitored closely to see if further action was needed to prevent the ongoing spread of coronavirus. The first minister said it was important people carried on working from home if they could. Mr Drakeford told the BBC the rate of 20 people in 100,000 was the ""threshold we use for people to have to quarantine coming back into the UK"". He said if that figure fell, the advice on face masks could be looked at again. The new mask rule would come in from Monday to give people time to buy one, he said. Masks were not ""some sort of magic wand"" but ""a sensible addition to the precautionary measures we are taking"" to avert a crisis. This video can not be played Stop your glasses steaming up with a mask on Mr Drakeford said masks would not be mandatory in workplaces and said wearing them in school did ""not seem proportionate."" Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said the announcement ""was very welcome"" though the evidence on them was ""never going to be 100%."" Conservative Member of the Senedd, Darren Millar, said on Twitter his party had been calling for mandatory masks in shops since early July: ""On Wednesday we tabled a debate in the Welsh Parliament. Today, the Welsh Labour-led Government finally act."" The Federation of Small Businesses said it hoped the new mask rules would ""provide reassurance"" to shoppers. But it joined the shop workers union USDAW in urging customers to continue treating staff with respect. ""The move to make wearing face coverings mandatory is further proof there will be no immediate return to normal shopping,"" said Sara Jones, head of the Welsh Retail Consortium. Those working in towns and city centres have broadly welcomed the move to avoid another full lockdown. ""Businesses just need to know what they have to do to be able to open up and trade,"" said Kevin Ward, manager of the Newport Now business improvement district. ""Certain regulations have changed through the pandemic but what nobody wants is to have to go into a full lockdown again. For a lot of independent businesses and [chain stores], they would not survive another lockdown,"" he said. Kevin Ward said retailers needed to know what to do in order to trade Neil Butler, of teachers' union NASUWT, said he was worried about schools: ""The Welsh Government is positively saying no, we do not want face coverings in those particular environments."" Ministers said the restrictions on people meeting followed an increase in cases linked to people socialising indoors. Up to four households have been able to form an extended household and meet since late August. Until now, there has been no legal limit on how many people could gather. Mr Drakeford said the rule of up to 30 people being allowed to meet outdoors would include peoples' gardens. Bubble trouble? What can you now do in lockdown? New rules 'no longer than we have to' - Hancock Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales Children aged under 11 are not included in the six. The new rules on meeting indoors will not apply in Caerphilly county borough, whichwas put under local lockdown on Tuesday, where all extended household meetings are currently banned inside. Shoppers wearing face masks in Caerphilly, the first place in Wales to have a local lockdown The move comes after other parts of the UK also restricted meetings to six - but did so both indoors and outdoors. The UK government is restricting gatherings in England to just six peoplefrom Monday, with some exceptions. The number of people that can meet in Scotlandhas also been cut to six. Wales' coronavirus rules mean people can only be part of a single extended household, which cannot be changed once arranged. Despite the gradual easing of restrictions over the summer, meetings indoors with anyone outside your extended household have remained illegal. The recent rise in cases seen in Caerphilly county was blamed on people socialising in other people's homes in large numbers. The area has seen one of the highest rates of cases in the whole of the UK, with 91.1 cases per 100,000 people over seven days. On Thursday, residents of Rhondda Cynon Taff and Merthyr Tydfil were asked to follow a range of measures to avoid a local lockdown.

EU trade talks hang in balance amid Brexit deal row,"Boris Johnson has urged Conservative MPs to back his plan to override part of the Brexit withdrawal agreement. In a Zoom call with around 250 of them, he said the party must not return to ""miserable squabbling"" over Europe. The EU has warned the UK it could face legal action if it does not ditch controversial elements of the Internal Market Bill by the end of the month. And a Tory MP has proposed an amendment to the bill, which would affect trade between Britain and Northern Ireland. Meanwhile, the European Parliament has threatened to scupper any UK-EU trade deal if the bill becomes UK law. Analysis: Despite bitter Brexit row can deal still be done? UK signs first major post-Brexit trade deal Brexit to dominate week ahead in Parliament UK at odds with EU over approval for food exports The two sides have less than five weeks to agree a deal before Mr Johnson's 15 October deadline - after which he says he is prepared to ""walk away"". Informal talks are due to resume on Monday, with the next official round of talks - the ninth since March - starting in Brussels on 28 September. TheInternal Market Bill,external, which will be formally debated in the House of Commons for the first time on Monday, addresses the Northern Ireland Protocol - the part of the Brexit withdrawal agreement designed to prevent a hard border returning to the island of Ireland. If it became law it would give UK ministers powers to modify or ""disapply"" rules relating to the movement of goods between Britain and Northern Ireland that will come into force from 1 January, if the UK and EU are unable to strike a trade deal. The EU says the planned changes must be scrappedor they risk jeopardising the UK-EU trade talks. But the government has rejected this demand, arguing the measures in the bill are needed to protect the integrity of the UK and the peace process in Northern Ireland. Lords' anger over 'hypocritical' Brexit bill Kuenssberg: Brexit deal stand-off threatens trade talks How many trade deals has the UK done? In his Zoom call with MPs on Friday, the prime minister did not take questions and a poor signal meant the video and audio connections were lost for several minutes. He called for ""overwhelming support"" for the bill, describing it as ""absolutely vital"" to ""prevent a foreign or international body from having the power to break up our country"". Mr Johnson added that he would not countenance ""the threat of a border down the Irish Sea"". But he said there was still a ""very good chance"" of the UK and EU striking a deal by mid-October similar to that previouslyagreed between the EU and Canada- which got rid of most, but not all, tariffs on goods. BBC chief political correspondent Vicki Young said Tory MPs were ""looking for a sign of compromise"" from Mr Johnson, as they ""simply can't believe the government is prepared to break international law"", but the prime minister ""dug his heels in"". In a column in the Daily Telegraph,external, Mr Johnson accused the EU of reinterpreting the Withdrawal Agreement to ""destroy the economic and territorial integrity of the UK"" and ""endanger peace and stability in Northern Ireland"". ""I have to say that we never seriously believed that the EU would be willing to use a treaty, negotiated in good faith, to blockade one part of the UK, to cut it off,"" he said. Conservative backbencher Sir Bob Neill, who chairs the Commons Justice Committee, said he was not reassured by the prime minister's Zoom call. He is tabling an amendment to the bill to try to force a separate parliamentary vote on any changes to the Withdrawal Agreement. ""I believe it is potentially a harmful act for this country, it would damage our reputation and I think it will make it harder to strike trade deals going forward,"" he said. At around the same time as the prime minister was speaking, the European Parliament announced it would ""under no circumstances ratify"" any trade deal reached between the UK and EU if the ""UK authorities breach or threaten to breach"" the withdrawal agreement. Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis has admitted parts of the bill, which would go against a treaty signed by the UK and EU, would ""break international law in a very specific and limited way"". There is unease over this within the Conservative Party, with former leaders Theresa May, Lord Howard and Sir John Major urging Mr Johnson to think again.

Putin apology to Serbia over Russian spokeswoman,"Maria Zakharova posted this photo from the White House, with Sharon Stone's crossed legs below it Russian President Vladimir Putin has issued a rare apology to his Serbian counterpart Aleksandar Vucic for a senior Russian official's Facebook post which angered Mr Vucic. Mr Vucic told Serbian TV about the apology and the Kremlin confirmed it. Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova posted a photo of Mr Vucic sitting opposite President Donald Trump in the White House and below it a photo of actress Sharon Stone's legs. Ms Zakharova herself later apologised. The provocative screenshot of the crossed legs came from the film Basic Instinct, in a scene where Sharon Stone's character briefly exposes herself. Ms Zakharova's post said Mr Vucic looked as if he was being interrogated by President Trump. ""If you are invited to the White House but your chair stands like you are in an interrogation, you should sit like in the picture number 2. Whoever you are. Just trust me,"" Ms Zakharova wrote. Maria Zakharova was thought to be taking aim at Serbian-US ties On Sunday she updated the post with an apology, saying her comments had been misunderstood. She said she was taking aim at American ""arrogance"", not the Serbian leader. Serbia accuses Russia of spy plot Putin given lavish welcome in Serbia On Thursday Mr Vucic told Serbian TV: ""President Putin has never apologised to me for anything, and neither has [Russian Foreign Minister] Sergei Lavrov. But both did."" Mr Vucic said he had spoken to Mr Putin by phone, and he added: ""I think we have good relations and for me this was a passing, unimportant incident."" Ms Zakharova's post came after Mr Vucic had signed a co-operation deal with Kosovo at the White House, and has been seen as a sign of Russian irritation with Serbian-US ties. Vladimir Putin, left, and Aleksandar Vucic have a good relationship Serbia has long been a key ally of Russia's in the Balkans, and neither country recognises Kosovo's independence. Mr Vucic was furious with Ms Zakharova's post. In televised comments he said ""Maria Zakharova speaks mostly about herself, and the primitivism and vulgarity she showed speaks of her, and by God, of those who placed her there"".

"Latest as coronavirus infections rise in EnglandFigures suggest there were 3,200 new cases a day in the first week of September, compared to 2,000 the week before.World","The reproduction number, or R value, of coronavirus transmission across the UK rises above 1 An Office for National Statistics study, which tests random samples of homes, shows cases in England surging Households in Birmingham are to be banned from mixing to combat the rise A new contact-tracing app is being launched across England and Wales on 24 September The UK economy grew by 6.6% in July, but the country's output remains far below pre-pandemic levels French authorities are meeting to decide on toughening measures after a surge in cases India has registered the world's highest-ever number of daily cases: 96,000 The number of confirmed coronavirus cases worldwide has topped 28 million, with more than 900,000 deaths Edited by Holly Wallis That's it from us for today - thanks for joining us. The writers for the live page today were: George Wright, Lauren Turner, Alice Cuddy and Alex Therrien. The page was edited by Vicky Baker and Holly Wallis. We're about to bring our live page to a pause for today, but before we do, here is a recap of the main stories from today: There are ""worrying signs"" of infections among the elderly, Public Health England's medical director Prof Yvonne Doyle has said. Her warning came as daily cases in the UK rose to the highest level since 17 May. A total of 3,539 new Covid-19 cases were recorded on Friday, the Department of Health said, up from 2,919 the previous day. Prof Doyle said: ""Although younger people continue to make up the greatest share of new cases, we're now starting to see worrying signs of infections occurring in the elderly, who are at far higher risk of getting seriously ill. ""This is a reminder of the ongoing risk as the virus spreads throughout the UK. ""People should continue to follow social distancing rules, wash their hands regularly and wear a face covering in enclosed spaces. ""You should not mix with others when unwell.""  New Covid-19 restrictions for parts of Northern Ireland, including Belfast and Ballymena,come into force on Monday. There are new social restrictions and guidance about travel and leisure. Here, BBC News NI answers some of the many readers' questions it has received about the changes, and what they mean for you. Mark SavageMusic reporter, BBC News Two weeks ago, in a walled garden in Hertfordshire, Sir Tom Jones played a greatest hits set to an audience of crickets and butterflies. This Sunday should have been the 10th instalment of BBC Radio 2 Live In Hyde Park - a ""festival in a day"" that sees the nation's biggest radio station throw a huge party for 50,000 fans in central London. This year's line-up was signed and sealed at the start of 2020, but it soon became apparent that coronavirus was going to play havoc with it. The search began for an alternative venue - one sufficiently secluded to stop crowds gathering, but big enough to accommodate the trucks needed to build a set and film the show. Once the location was identified, organisers went back to the artists. Some had to pull out, but the core line-up - including, of course, Sir Tom - remained intact. The pre-recorded show will be broadcast this weekend for Radio 2 Live At Home. Here's more on how they did it. Spain has recorded 4,708 new coronavirus cases in 24 hours, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in the country to 566,326. In total, it reported a record increase of 12,183 new cases in its figures on Friday, but a lag in reporting means that cases can take several days to appear on the central government's data. Spain is the first country in the European Union to reach half a million coronavirus cases. It has recorded 29,747 deaths. Like other countries, Spain has ramped up testing for the virus. A strict three-month national lockdown was lifted in the country at the end of June, but authorities have imposed fresh restrictions - such as making face masks mandatory in public - amid a rise in infections. Covid-secure marshals will be introduced in towns and city centres in England to help ensure social distancing rules are followed, Prime Minister Boris Johnson recently announced. Marshals have already been used in Leeds and Cornwall during the coronavirus pandemic. However, plans to roll them out more widely have been criticised, with Conservative MP Steve Baker saying it would ""turn every public space in Britain into the equivalent of going through airport security"". So what is a Covid-secure marshal and what powers will they have? Read more France has seen an increase in people being admitted to hospital with coronavirus in recent days French Prime Minister Jean Castex says coronavirus is ""circulating more and more"" in the country, but that officials want to avoid any new nationwide lockdown. In a televised statement, Mr Castex announced several changes to Covid-19 testing and confinement policies. These include fast-tracking testing for priority cases, recruiting extra testers, and asking patients who have tested positive for Covid-19 to confine themselves for seven days, instead of 14. Mr Castex said the situation in Marseille, Bordeaux and Guadeloupe was ""worrying"", and that local authorities would be given more powers to tackle specific outbreaks. He said it was particularly concerning that the number of hospital admissions for coronavirus has gone up for the first time in weeks. The French government is under pressure to curb the spread of the virus amid a surge in cases. On Thursday, the countryrecorded almost 10,000 new coronavirus casesin 24 hours, marking its highest single-day count since the start of the outbreak.  Leicester's Diwali celebrations - believed to be among the biggest outside of India - have been cancelled due to coronavirus restrictions. Thousands of people usually gather to watch traditional dance and music events in the city throughout October. However, while the lights along the Golden Mile will still be switched on, Leicester City Council said large gatherings have to be prevented. Christmas events are also cancelled but decorations will still go up. Read more People living in the Scottish region of Lanarkshire will not be able to meet other households indoors from midnight on Friday. Similar measures are already in place in Glasgow, East and West Dunbartonshire, Renfrewshire and East Renfrewshire. The extension to North and South Lanarkshire means the restrictions now cover more than 1.75 million people in the west of Scotland. Read more here Armenia's Prime Minister Nikol Pashinya said the situation with coronavirus is improving Armenia has lifted its state of emergency but says some of its coronavirus restrictions will remain in place until January. The government said it had decided to end the state of emergency, which was introduced in mid-March and extended several times, because coronavirus was spreading less quickly than before. But its land borders will remain closed, public gatherings of more than 60 people will be banned, and mask-wearing will continue to be mandatory in enclosed public spaces, AFP news agency reports. Armenia - which has a population of about three million people - has recorded 45,503 coronavirus cases and 909 deaths so far.  Sex workers protested against a ban in DÃ¼sseldorf Coronavirus has been an unpleasant
intrusion into peopleâs intimacy in all sorts of ways, not least sex. German sex workers have won a
reprieve â even if it is temporary â as brothels are reopening in several
states, including the most populous one, North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW). Courts have decided that brothels
can operate provided there are strict hygiene rules â like at hairdressers - and
prostitutes wear masks with their clients. The top court in NRW found one-on-one
sex to be no more risky in the pandemic than say aerobics in a gym or a party
with dozens of revellers. It is also argued that keeping
brothels closed risks exposing sex workers to more crime, as they struggle to
make ends meet, German media report. The crisis has already bankrupted
one of Europeâs biggest brothels â 10-storey Pascha in Cologne, where about 120
prostitutes worked, along with cooks and hairdressers. Brothels are back in business in five
northern states, including Hamburg, and Saxony-Anhalt state in the east. Schools across Bristol will take part in the study A research project to track coronavirus infections in schools and help head teachers prevent disruption is being piloted in Bristol. The study aims to understand exactly how pupils transmit the virus, whether or not they are symptomatic. The University of Bristol study will saliva-test 4,000 pupils and 1,000 staff from schools across the city once a month for six months. It should provide vital information on how schools should deal with outbreaks. Read more Earlier, we reported that the coronavirus infection rate has been growing in the UK in recent weeks, according to new estimates. The reproduction number in the UK is now thought to be between 1 and 1.2. The R number is a way of rating coronavirus or any disease's ability to spread in the population. A number above 1 means the epidemic is growing, while below 1 it declines. Read more about how it is calculated and the different R numbers across UK areas here. A further 3,539 people have tested positive for coronavirus in the UK, figures released by the Department of Health and Social Care show. It is the sixth day in a row where daily cases have exceeded 2,000. It takes the total number of UK cases to 361,677. A further six deaths have been recorded in those who had a positive coronavirus test in the last 28 days. This takes the death toll by this criteria to 41,608. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Golden Week is one of China's biggest periods of migration Six
months since the World Health Organization declared Covid-19 a global pandemic,
China seems full of confidence that
itâs seen the back of the virus. It
has been 26 days since any domestic cases of Covid-19 were confirmed in the
country, and the government says that people donât need to take any extra
precautions ahead of one of the countryâs biggest annual migrations next month:
Golden Week. This is an annual week-long holiday that begins on 1 October. This
is the first time Chinese people have been told they can travel safely anywhere
in the country. But there is still apprehension, given cases became widespread
after Chinese New Year in January - the only other extended period of mass
migration. When the pandemic was announced in March, China - where the outbreak started - was already over its worst. Since then, many Chinese people have
been confident that a second wave can be avoided. In
the last six months, there have been around 4,300 confirmed cases of Covid-19
within the country's 1.4 billion population. These
were in major cities, including Beijing, the city of Dalian in northeastern
Liaoning, and Urumqi in northwestern Xinjiang. Local governments introduced
swift lockdowns as soon as a single case was detected, and citywide testing for
symptomatic and asymptomatic carriers appears to have helped bring these outbreaks under
control. The US is marking the anniversary of the 9/11 attacks amid coronavirus restrictions. Like others in attendance, Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, Vice President Mike Pence and New York Governor Andrew Cuomo all wore masks as they gathered at the site of the destroyed World Trade Center for a memorial ceremony. Mr Biden and Mr Pence bumped elbows in greeting. A number of 9/11 memorial events across the US were cancelled or modified this year because of the pandemic. At the New York event, a longstanding tradition of relatives reading the names of the dead was changed to a recording being played over speakers because of coronavirus safety precautions. But a separate 9/11 group organised an event nearby, where they said people would be allowed to recite the names while keeping a safe distance. Nearly 3,000 people were killed in the attacks on 11 September 2001. Two hijacked planes slammed into the Twin Towers, a third hit the Pentagon and a fourth was taken down in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, when its passengers rose up against the hijackers. US President Donald Trump led tributes at an event in Shanksville. As we've reported,a number of Conservative backbenchers have been criticising the government's new coronavirus restrictions. Former minister Sir Christopher Chope is the latest to voice his concerns, telling the Commons earlier that MPs should have been able to debate the introduction of the ""draconian"" new measures. A new so-called ""rule of six"" is being introduced on Monday, limiting the number of people who can socialise together indoors or outdoors in England to six people. However, the statutory instrument needed to enact the rule change has yet to be laid before Parliament. Sir Christopher said he was ""very concerned about the lack of opportunity for people, the public first of all, to see the text of these new regulations, and I'm also concerned about the continuing reluctance of the government to give any opportunities to members to debate this"". He added: ""What we are talking about is the most draconian introduction of new restrictions on our liberty, with criminal sanctions, and we need to be made aware of what's happening and given the opportunity of debating it."" Responding, Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle said ""the country should also know what's going on"". The game was held at Burnside Working Men's Club More than 60 people have tested positive for coronavirus following a charity football match, health officials have said. A further 33 people have now contracted the virus amid an outbreak linked to the event at Burnside Working Men's Club in Fencehouses, on the border of Sunderland and County Durham. About 300 people who attended the game, on 30 August, are having to self-isolate for 14 days. Read more Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford has warned that coronavirus is ""on the rise again in Wales"". The new case rate is now 20 per 100,000 people - the rate at which quarantine measures can be introduced for those returning to the country from abroad. Mr Drakeford said it ""indicates there is a serious risk of the virus spreading more widely once again"". He added there was a ""short window to get ahead of the gathering storm"" and avoid ""more draconian measures"" - especially with schools, colleges and universities returning. He urged people to work from home wherever possible. Regarding the messaging in England, to encourage people back to the office, he added: ""This is not and never has been our policy in Wales."" Meeting people indoors has been at the heart of the rise in cases, he said, confirming it will be illegal from Monday to meet more than six people from an extended household indoors. People who flout the laws in Wales will face fines if they don't wear masks indoors from Monday as well, he said. Read more here. Â© 2025 BBC.

Mr Vucic told Serbian TV about the apology and the Kremlin confirmed it. Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova posted a photo of Mr Vucic sitting opposite President Donald Trump in the White House and below it a photo of actress Sharon Stone's legs. Ms Zakharova herself later apologised. The provocative screenshot of the crossed legs came from the film Basic Instinct, in a scene where Sharon Stone's character briefly exposes herself. Ms Zakharova's post said Mr Vucic looked as if he was being interrogated by President Trump. ""If you are invited to the White House but your chair stands like you are in an interrogation, you should sit like in the picture number 2. Whoever you are. Just trust me,"" Ms Zakharova wrote. Maria Zakharova was thought to be taking aim at Serbian-US ties On Sunday she updated the post with an apology, saying her comments had been misunderstood. She said she was taking aim at American ""arrogance"", not the Serbian leader.

"Gang's lie detectors, threats and drugs 'hotline'","This video can not be played The judge described it as a ""sophisticated operation"" run from the Walton area of Liverpool Eighteen people have been jailed for their part in a gang that flooded north Wales with drugs. They were arrested in September 2019as part of the largest operation of its type ever carried out by North Wales Police. A judge at Mold Crown Court described it as a ""sophisticated operation"", involving encrypted mobile phones, lie detectors and even a plot to attack a former gang member who had fallen out of favour. Police seized drugs with a street value of Â£2.1m. '100 county lines drug networks in Wales' Call to review 'criminal abuse' of mobile phones County lines threat prompts university to act The reach of the gang, based in Liverpool, stretched to Aberdeen and Cornwall. It was an operation described as a classic example of a ""county lines"" conspiracy. The group behind the supply, led by Colin Jones, were violent and were specifically targeted by police due to the threat posed to public safety. Colin Jones and Richard Anderson met to exchange a white Mercedes car for cocaine in October 2018 Officers had spent nearly three years investigating the gang, right to the very top. Colin Jones, based in Walton in Liverpool, was described as a drugs wholesaler who rarely got his hands dirty. When he was arrested, police found he had nine phones, and two encrypted devices. He hired lie detector specialists to check out his colleagues. As well as selling drugs, he swapped them for sports cars. Anthony Stagg and Tony Stagg in Towyn to meet Colin Jones in August 2018 Colin Jones had a team of call handlers who answered what the gang called ""the Echo Line"". In a three-month period in 2018, the hotline took over 100,000 calls. Police estimated it was selling several thousand pounds of drugs a day. Drugs were also sent up and down the UK, sometimes in packages sent from local post offices in Liverpool. This video can not be played What are ""county lines"" drug gangs? At one point the violence was turned on one of their former conspirators. Colin Jones and David Rawling were secretly recorded talking to an unknown hit man arranging an attack on Lee Murray. Officers stepped in and stopped the attack, but believed a gun would have been involved. Judge Niclas Parry spent three days sentencing the gang. He said they had controlled a significant portion of the drugs trade in Deeside, casting a blight on the community. Colin Jones was sentenced to 21 yearsin total with the other gang members given sentences from four to 15 and a half years. Police say it is a significant victory against the supply of drugs from big cities into north Wales - but it remains a fight that will continue in the months to come.

"Tory MPs criticise 'rule of six' decisionOne ex-minister says it was ""outrageous"" new rules were made ""without consultation"" of Parliament.UKComments","Some Tory MPs have criticised England's latest coronavirus rules that legally ban gatherings of more than six people. Ex-minister Steve Baker said the action amounted to ""arbitrary powers without scrutiny"" and MP Desmond Swayne said it was ""outrageous"" not to have a Parliamentary debate. BBC Newsnight understands some MPs want the rules to be reviewed more often. The health secretary says the new rules in England will not be kept in place ""any longer than we have to"". It comes as coronavirus infections have increased in recent weeks in the UK,according to estimates from Office for National Statistics. The government's latest R number - which measures the virus' ability to spread - is between 1 and 1.2 which means the epidemic is growing. Andhouseholds in Birmingham will be banned from mixingunder measures announced on Friday. The city has the second highest rate of Covid-19 infection in England, behind Bolton. Meanwhile, a Covid-19 contact-tracing app will be launched across England and Wales on 24 September,the government has announced. What are the new rules? 'We've got four kids so can't see anyone else' Who are the Covid marshals and what will they do? What will happen if children catch coronavirus? From Monday, the law change in England will ban more than six people meeting anywhere socially indoors or outdoors - dubbed the ""rule of six"". It will not apply to schools, workplaces or Covid-secure weddings, funerals and organised team sports. The rule will be enforced through a Â£100 fine if people fail to comply, doubling on each offence up to a maximum of Â£3,200. The measures include the introduction of ""Covid-secure marshals"", to help ensure social distancing in town and city centres. Scotland and Wales will also cut the number of people to allowed to meet up to six from Monday, amid concern over a sustained rise in cases. But in Scotland children under the age of 12 will not count towards the total, and in Wales the rule will not apply to children under 11 and up to 30 can still meet outside. But BBC Newsnight's political editor Nick Watt said there was a ""sour mood"" on the Tory benches, adding: ""Tory MPs do accept the government does need to introduce some measures to control the virus, but they want to clip the government's wings and that means demanding a greater role for Parliament."" He said senior Conservative backbenchers are lobbying Commons Speaker Lindsay Hoyle - who accused the government this week of bypassing Parliament - to make sure that legislation is being reviewed every month, not every six months. Conservative MP Steve Baker described the new restrictions as ""madness"". ""When you look at the draconian nature of the imposition on the British people, the shifting and uncertain legal environment, the lack of scrutiny and what has changed about this disease, I think it's time now to say that this is not a fit legal environment for the British people,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""It's time to move to a voluntary system, unless the government can demonstrate otherwise and it is time for us to start living like a free people."" He said the decision to have Covid marshals ""will turn every space in Britain in the equivalent of going into airport security where we are badgered"". ""I'm not willing to live like this,"" he added. Another ex-minister Sir Desmond Swayne said it was ""outrageous"" the laws had ""been made without consultation in Parliament"" and without any debate. SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? SUPPORT BUBBLES:What are they and who can be in yours? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? TESTING:What tests are available? Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth told BBC Newsnight his party was ""obviously concerned about civil liberties as well"" and when the original piece of coronavirus legislation went through Parliament ""we did raise our concerns"". ""But we also are aware we are in the midst of the biggest public health crisis we've faced for over 100 years and we understand that decisive and upsetting, difficult action has to be taken,"" he said. Announcing the detail of the rule change in England on Wednesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said ""we must act"" to avoid another lockdown, amid a rise in virus cases. Mr Johnson said the rules had ""become quite complicated and confusing"" and the government was ""simplifying and strengthening"" them after feedback from police and the public. The new ""rule of six"" means: Social gatheringsof more than six peoplein England will not be allowed in lawfrom Monday 14 September The new ruleapplies to people in private homes, indoors and outdoors, and places such as pubs, restaurants, cafes and public outdoor spaces Itapplies to all ages The ruledoes not apply to schools and workplaces, to people living together or in the same support bubble, or to weddings, funerals and organised team sports Thefull list of exemptions,externalalso includesprotests and political activitiessubject to ""strict risk assessments"", jury service and providing emergency assistance Peoplewho ignore the policecould be fined Â£100 - doubling with each offence to a maximum of Â£3,200 The prime minister also said on Wednesday the intention to return fans to stadiums from 1 October will be reviewed and pilot test events in September will be restricted to 1,000 fans. But on Friday the Premier League wrote to the government to say its clubs will defer holding test events ""until a sufficient number of fans are allowed back to enable thorough trials to take place"".

Israel and Bahrain agree to normalise relations,"Israel's PM Benjamin Netanyahu and Bahrain's King Hamad bin Isa bin Salman al-Khalifa Israel and the Gulf state of Bahrain have reached a landmark deal to fully normalise their relations, US President Donald Trump has announced. ""The second Arab country to make peace with Israel in 30 days,"" he tweeted. For decades, most Arab states have boycotted Israel, insisting they would only establish ties after the Palestinian dispute was settled. But last month the United Arab Emirates (UAE) agreed to normalise its relationship with Israel. There had been much speculation that Bahrain might follow suit. Mr Trump, who presented his Middle East peace plan in January aimed at resolving the Israel-Palestinian conflict, helped broker both accords. Israel opens tentative new chapter with Gulf Arabs What does Trump's Mid-East plan say on key issues? Bahrain is only the fourth Arab country in the Middle East - after the UAE, Egypt and Jordan - to recognise Israel since its founding in 1948. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he was ""excited"" that ""another peace agreement"" had been reached with another Arab country on Friday. ""This is a new era of peace. Peace for peace. Economy for economy. We have invested in peace for many years and now peace will invest in us,"" he said. This is a diplomatic achievement for President Trump and for his son-in-law Jared Kushner, who largely brokered the agreements with Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates. On returning from a recent trip to the Middle East, Mr Kushner told journalists the Trump administration had ""unleashed an energy positivity"" in the region that was ""quite overwhelming."" White House bullet points suggest how Mr Trump will be framing his international dealmaker credentials for his election campaign: as a harbinger of Middle East peace and prosperity, with more Arab and Muslim countries likely coming on board to normalise relations with Israel. This will allow Mr Trump to deflect attention from the ""Deal of the Century"" that he failed to achieve: Israeli-Palestinian peace. That project was widely criticised as heavily slanted in Israel's favour and rejected by the Palestinians. Focusing outward is the Trump administration's way of telling the Palestinians they can no longer dictate the region's relations with Israel. ""Another historic breakthrough today!"" Mr Trump wrote on Twitter, adding: ""Our two GREAT friends Israel and the Kingdom of Bahrain agree to a Peace Deal."" The president alsoposted on Twitter a copy of a joint statement,externalbetween the three leaders - Mr Trump, Mr Netanyahu and Bahrain's King Hamad bin Isa bin Salman al-Khalifa. ""This is a historic breakthrough to further peace in the Middle East"" that will ""increase stability, security, and prosperity in the region"", the statement reads. The UAE welcomed the latest move. The ministry of foreign affairs said it was ""another significant and historic achievement which will contribute enormously to the stability and prosperity of the region"". However, there was an angry response from Palestinian officials. The Palestinian foreign ministry recalled its ambassador to Bahrain for consultation and a statement from the Palestinian leadership spoke of the ""great harm it causes to the inalienable national rights of the Palestinian people and joint Arab action"". The Palestinians have long relied on a unified Arab response on the issues of Israeli withdrawal from occupied territory and the acceptance of a Palestinian state. Hamas, the militant Islamist group that controls Gaza, said the move ""represents a grave harm to the Palestinian cause"". Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, a special adviser on international affairs for the speaker of Iran's parliament, said it was a betrayal of the Palestinian cause, Reuters reports. There is a backdrop of the regional rivalry between Saudi Arabia and Iran in these diplomatic moves. The decades-old feud between them is exacerbated by religious differences. They each follow one of the two main branches of Islam - Iran is largely Shia Muslim, while Saudi Arabia sees itself as the leading Sunni Muslim power. Why Saudi Arabia and Iran are bitter rivals The UAE and Bahrain - both Saudi allies - have shared with Israel worries over Iran, leading to unofficial contacts. Saudi Arabia's response will be watched closely. There is no indication yet it is ready to follow Bahrain and the UAE. This video can not be played Jared Kushner: ""A new script for a new Middle East"" Prior tothe announcement of the UAE agreement in August- which included the suspension of Israel's controversial plans to annex parts of the occupied West Bank - Israel had had no diplomatic relations with Gulf Arab countries. Last month saw the first official flight from Israel to the UAE, which was seen as a major step in normalising relations. President Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner, who was on the plane, described the UAE deal as having ""the ability to change the whole course of the Middle East"". Bahrain last week said it would allow flights between Israel and the UAE to use its airspace.

Tory MPs criticise 'rule of six' decision,"Some Tory MPs have criticised England's latest coronavirus rules that legally ban gatherings of more than six people. Ex-minister Steve Baker said the action amounted to ""arbitrary powers without scrutiny"" and MP Desmond Swayne said it was ""outrageous"" not to have a Parliamentary debate. BBC Newsnight understands some MPs want the rules to be reviewed more often. The health secretary says the new rules in England will not be kept in place ""any longer than we have to"". It comes as coronavirus infections have increased in recent weeks in the UK,according to estimates from Office for National Statistics. The government's latest R number - which measures the virus' ability to spread - is between 1 and 1.2 which means the epidemic is growing. Andhouseholds in Birmingham will be banned from mixingunder measures announced on Friday. The city has the second highest rate of Covid-19 infection in England, behind Bolton. Meanwhile, a Covid-19 contact-tracing app will be launched across England and Wales on 24 September,the government has announced. What are the new rules? 'We've got four kids so can't see anyone else' Who are the Covid marshals and what will they do? What will happen if children catch coronavirus? From Monday, the law change in England will ban more than six people meeting anywhere socially indoors or outdoors - dubbed the ""rule of six"". It will not apply to schools, workplaces or Covid-secure weddings, funerals and organised team sports. The rule will be enforced through a Â£100 fine if people fail to comply, doubling on each offence up to a maximum of Â£3,200. The measures include the introduction of ""Covid-secure marshals"", to help ensure social distancing in town and city centres. Scotland and Wales will also cut the number of people to allowed to meet up to six from Monday, amid concern over a sustained rise in cases. But in Scotland children under the age of 12 will not count towards the total, and in Wales the rule will not apply to children under 11 and up to 30 can still meet outside. But BBC Newsnight's political editor Nick Watt said there was a ""sour mood"" on the Tory benches, adding: ""Tory MPs do accept the government does need to introduce some measures to control the virus, but they want to clip the government's wings and that means demanding a greater role for Parliament."" He said senior Conservative backbenchers are lobbying Commons Speaker Lindsay Hoyle - who accused the government this week of bypassing Parliament - to make sure that legislation is being reviewed every month, not every six months. Conservative MP Steve Baker described the new restrictions as ""madness"". ""When you look at the draconian nature of the imposition on the British people, the shifting and uncertain legal environment, the lack of scrutiny and what has changed about this disease, I think it's time now to say that this is not a fit legal environment for the British people,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""It's time to move to a voluntary system, unless the government can demonstrate otherwise and it is time for us to start living like a free people."" He said the decision to have Covid marshals ""will turn every space in Britain in the equivalent of going into airport security where we are badgered"". ""I'm not willing to live like this,"" he added. Another ex-minister Sir Desmond Swayne said it was ""outrageous"" the laws had ""been made without consultation in Parliament"" and without any debate. SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? SUPPORT BUBBLES:What are they and who can be in yours? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? TESTING:What tests are available? Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth told BBC Newsnight his party was ""obviously concerned about civil liberties as well"" and when the original piece of coronavirus legislation went through Parliament ""we did raise our concerns"". ""But we also are aware we are in the midst of the biggest public health crisis we've faced for over 100 years and we understand that decisive and upsetting, difficult action has to be taken,"" he said. Announcing the detail of the rule change in England on Wednesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said ""we must act"" to avoid another lockdown, amid a rise in virus cases. Mr Johnson said the rules had ""become quite complicated and confusing"" and the government was ""simplifying and strengthening"" them after feedback from police and the public. The new ""rule of six"" means: Social gatheringsof more than six peoplein England will not be allowed in lawfrom Monday 14 September The new ruleapplies to people in private homes, indoors and outdoors, and places such as pubs, restaurants, cafes and public outdoor spaces Itapplies to all ages The ruledoes not apply to schools and workplaces, to people living together or in the same support bubble, or to weddings, funerals and organised team sports Thefull list of exemptions,externalalso includesprotests and political activitiessubject to ""strict risk assessments"", jury service and providing emergency assistance Peoplewho ignore the policecould be fined Â£100 - doubling with each offence to a maximum of Â£3,200 The prime minister also said on Wednesday the intention to return fans to stadiums from 1 October will be reviewed and pilot test events in September will be restricted to 1,000 fans. But on Friday the Premier League wrote to the government to say its clubs will defer holding test events ""until a sufficient number of fans are allowed back to enable thorough trials to take place"".

UK economy continues recovery in July,"Pubs and restaurant activity rebounded by 140% in July The UK economy grew by 6.6% in July, according to official figures, but remains far below pre-pandemic levels. It is the third month in a row that the economy has expanded. But the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said that the UK ""has still only recovered just over half of the lost output caused by the coronavirus"". Hairdressers, pubs and restaurants contributed to growth after companies were allowed to reopen in July. Definitely not. The UK's economy - which is measured by the value and the volume of goods and services it produces - is still 11.7% smaller than it was in February, before lockdown was imposed. Growth in July was also slower than the 8.7% expansion seen in June. There are encouraging signs, however. Thomas Pugh, UK economist at Capital Economics, said the reopening of restaurants and pubs meant the accommodation and food services sector ""rose by a whopping 140.8%"" between June and July. This had a knock-on effect for the alcohol industry which grew by 32.7%. Keeping youngsters occupied while at home also continued to boost demand for toys and games, said the ONS, while holidaying in the UK supported campsites, cottages and caravan parks ""because of a large increase in staycations"". However, activity in the accommodation and food services sector was still 60.1% below the level recorded in February. And while Mr Pugh expects the Eat Out to Help Out scheme to provide a further boost in August, ""now that most sectors in the economy are open again there is little scope for further large rises in monthly GDP"". Meanwhile, the car sector saw demand return to pre-pandemic levels. ""Car sales exceeded pre-crisis levels for the first time with showrooms having a particularly busy time,"" said Darren Morgan, director of economic statistics at the ONS. Up, up, but not away. The UK economy continued a sharp recovery from lockdown in July, growing by a bumper 6.6% in the month. But the rate of recovery was a little slower than in June, raising some concerns about the ongoing strength of the bounce back. The economy is still nearly 12% smaller than before the pandemic crisis, and has recovered just over half of the lost output during the shutdowns. While the third quarter is on course to see a record number for growth and the official end of recession, fears remain that the recovery could peter out. Business groups continue to push for extensions to government support packages that are due to close. The figures in July reflected the partial reopening of retail, manufacturing, and some public sector activities such as schools. Forecasts vary but the consensus is it won't be swift. The UK fell into recession after activity shrank for the first and second quarters of this year after the government announced a lockdown to stop the spread of the coronavirus. And in the three months to July, the economy shrank by 7.6%. How could a recession affect me? So how many friends can I meet now? What are the rules on weddings? Mr Pugh questioned how strong the UK's recovery would be throughout the rest of the year. ""Talk of tax rises at the next Budget, a further deterioration in the Brexit negotiations and a worrying rise in the number of virus cases and tighter social distancing restrictions will all conspire to slow the recovery even further,"" he said. Hairdressers contributed to economic growth in July after being allowed to reopen Dean Turner, economist at UBS Global Wealth Management, predicts that it will take until the end of 2021 before the UK recovers to pre-pandemic levels. ""Even with a managed exit from the Brexit transition agreement, it is unlikely that the lost output would be recovered before the end of next year,"" he said. ""The latest twist in negotiations raises the prospect that any recovery may take longer."" The number of coronavirus cases in the UK have begun rising again and social gatherings of more than six people will be illegal in England from Monday. ""The recovery likely will stall if, as looks likely, new Covid-19 infections continue to rise, keeping people working from home and avoiding consuming services that require close human contact,"" said Samuel Tombs chief UK economist, Pantheon Macroeconomics. ""Accordingly, we continue to expect GDP to be about 5% below its peak at the end of this year."" Meanwhile, the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme is due to end on 31 October. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has been emphatic that it will not continue. However, the Resolution Foundation think tank said he ""needs to reconsider his plans to swiftly phase out support given that the economic crisis will be with us for some time to come"". Former prime minister and chancellor Gordon Brown, warned that ending the furlough scheme was a ""cliff-edge"" that could trigger ""a tsunami of unemployment"". ""The government's got to change course here,"" he told the BBC's Today programme. What is a recession and how could one affect me?

Europe to take 400 Moria child migrants after fire,"This video can not be played The BBC's Jean Mackenzie reflects on her experiences at the camp Germany says 10 European countries have agreed to take 400 unaccompanied minors who fled Greece's largest migrant camp when it was gutted by fire. Most will go to Germany and France, Interior Minister Horst Seehofer told reporters on Friday. Close to 13,000 people had been living in squalor in the Moria camp on Lesbos. Families have been sleeping in fields and on roads after fleeing the blaze on Wednesday, as authorities struggle to find accommodation for them. Near the ruins of Moria, residents of the island blocked roads to stop charities from delivering aid and said they were against the construction of new tents. But the Greek military later used helicopters to reach the site and have begun setting up replacement accommodation. After visiting the area, European Commission Vice-President Margaritis Schinas announced that the devastated camp would be replaced by a modern facility at the same location. The Moria camp was initially designed to house 3,000 migrants. People from 70 countries had been sheltered there, most from Afghanistan. By Bethany Bell, BBC News, Lesbos Migrants from the burnt-out Moria camp are staging a protest in front of the police barriers which prevent them from moving to other parts of the island. Singing and banging plastic bottles, they march up and down a stretch of coastal road, calling for the right to leave Lesbos. One person carried a large piece of cardboard emblazoned with the message: ""We don't want food, we want freedom."" Another banner read: ""Moria kills all lives"". Protesters stage a demonstration against the creation of a replacement camp at the Moria site Many local Greeks too want the migrants to leave the island. They strongly oppose plans to rebuild a temporary camp. Sanitary conditions are grim. There's little running water, and washing is difficult. ""Now is the time to shut down Moria for good,"" Vangelis Violatzis, a local municipal leader on Lesbos, told AFP news agency. Fleeing Lesbos fire: 'Daddy, are we going to die?' How the migrant crisis changed Europe How to deal with the mass arrivals of migrants, mainly to Italy and Greece, has divided the EU for years. Italy and Greece have accused wealthier northern countries of failing to do more, while a number of central and eastern nations are openly resistant to the idea of taking in a quota of migrants. Mr Seehofer said France and Germany would each accept between 100 and 150 of the children. The Netherlands has already pledged to accept 50 andFinland will take 11,external. Talks are ongoing with other states to take part, Mr Seehofer said. Other countries expected to take in children include Switzerland, Belgium, Croatia, Slovenia, Luxembourg and Portugal, according to German reports. The fire at Moria was ""a sharp reminder to all of us for what we need to change in Europe"", the interior minister said. While a solution has been found for unaccompanied children, the other residents of Moria continue to wait But a group of charities and NGOs have written to the German government saying more has to be done for all of the migrants, not just those minors. ""The shameful situation in the camp and the fire disaster are the direct result of a failed European refugee policy - now the EU must finally help the people affected,""the open letter reads,external. All 400 children have now been flown to the Greek mainland. EU home affairs commissioner Ylva Johansson said on Wednesday that the EU had agreed to finance the transfer of the minors to the mainland and their accommodation. ""The safety and shelter of all people in Moria is a priority,""she tweeted,external. This video can not be played Migrants are struggling to cope out in the open On Thursday, Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said the migrant crisis was Europe's problem, and concrete action was needed by the EU to tackle it. German Chancellor Angela Merkel spoke to Mr Mitsotakis on the phone and said she had agreed Germany would take some of the migrant children. Med's deadly migrant crisis: In maps and charts Protecting yourself from coronavirus in a migrant camp Touring the burnt-out Moria site on Thursday, Mr Schinas said it was ""inconceivable"" that the EU did not yet have a unified migration policy. He said the Commission's proposals for a new pact on migration and asylum, due to be presented on 30 September, would ""put an end to this unacceptable situation"". Fires broke out in more than three places overnight on Tuesday, according to local fire chief Konstantinos Theofilopoulos. Further fires left the camp almost completely destroyed. The fires started hours after reports that 35 people had tested positive for Covid-19 at the camp. Authorities placed the facility under quarantine last week after a Somali migrant was confirmed to have contracted coronavirus. Eight of the 35 who tested positive for Covid-19 are since believed to have been found and isolated. Greek Migration Minister Notis Mitarachi said the fires ""began with the asylum seekers because of the quarantine imposed"". Some of those infected with the virus had reportedly refused to move into isolation with their families. He did not say, however, that the fires were a deliberate act of arson aimed at destroying the camp. But some migrants told BBC Persian that the fire had broken out after scuffles between migrants and Greek forces at the camp. Greece has sent three ships to Lesbos to provide accommodation for some 2,000 migrants. The Blue Star Chios ferry, which has capacity to house 1,000 people, has docked at the Lesbos port of Sigri. Two naval vessels have also been provided. But officials have also increased security on the island. Military personnel, riot police and water cannon have arrived at the scene. Water and fruit was distributed to those who had sought shelter at the Moria camp On a car park park outside a supermarket on Thursday, hundreds of migrants, including families with small children, waited for bottled water and food to be distributed. ""There is no food, no milk for the baby,"" Congolese migrant Natzy Malala, who had a newborn infant and an eight-year-old girl, told Reuters news agency. But there is strong resistance from locals for a new camp to house them. ""We don't want another camp, and we will oppose any construction work. We've faced this situation for five years, it's time for others to bear this burden,"" local leader Vangelis Violatzis was quoted as saying. Child migrants sleep in pens at Lesbos port.

Man arrested after video shows boy driving lorry,"The film appears to show a boy at the wheel of a lorry, apparently on the M1 near Dungannon A 37-year-old man has been released on bail after a video appearing to show a boy driving a lorry on a motorway in Northern Ireland was shared online. It is believed the incident happened on the M1 eastbound at Dungannon. Police had appealed for anyone who recognised the boy or the voice in the video to contact them. The man was arrested in Cookstown, County Tyrone, suspected of aiding and abetting driving while disqualified by reason of age. He was also questioned on suspicion of cruelty to children.

Wales' mask rule 'to get ahead of gathering storm',"This video can not be played First Minister Mark Drakeford says he is confident there will be ""good levels of compliance"" People in Wales must wear face masks in shops and other indoor public spaces from Monday as coronavirus cases rise. First Minister Mark Drakeford said the change was because 20 people in every 100,000 in Wales now had Covid-19, asthe UK infection R number rose to 1.2. Indoor meetings of more than six from an extended household will be illegal from Monday, with fines in place. It comes as,externalto avoid followingCaerphilly into a local lockdown. The Welsh Government said the face mask rule would not apply to children aged under 11. Where do I have to wear a face covering now? England and Wales' contact-tracing app to launch R number goes above 1 as coronavirus cases rise Mr Drakeford warned flouting face covering restrictions could face a fine of Â£1,920. He said curfews and the restriction of alcohol sales were among measures that could now be taken. The new restriction will apply in pubs and restaurants, as well as private homes, meaning groups of six must be part of the same extended household. He said most people had complied with social distancing rules but ""a small minority have not done so"". New powers would allow local authorities to close premises or stop events happening on public health grounds. ""These powers will enable local authorities to move quickly to respond to outbreaks of the virus in their areas, for example where a number of cases are linked to a particular premise or as a preventative measure, where there is a high risk of outbreak,"" Mr Drakeford said. Charlotte Harding lives in Ferndale in the Rhondda with husband Richard and sons Ethan, 8, and Harrison, 6 Charlotte Harding, a mother of two, has had to cancel her son's birthday meal because of Wales' new rules. ""We are due to go the Sunday after next to have a family meal for my son's birthday. That won't go ahead now,"" she said. ""With three families coming together, that's not going to be a possibility. The boys are going to be upset as we won't be able to see our niece, we won't be able to see their nans. ""I have a lot of friends whose households are made up of six people so it is going to be a struggle for lots of families. ""All those little anxieties I had before the lockdown are back. I am a bit worried about not being able to see my family, the children not being able to see their grandparents. That's going to be hard again"". The first minister said there was ""a short window to get ahead of the gathering storm"" of coronavirus. Mr Drakeford said that following the rules would help avoid ""more draconian measures"". Public Health Wales data shows there have been no deaths with coronavirus in Wales in September Mr Drakeford said the ""hotspot areas"" of Caerphilly county, Merthyr Tydfil and Rhondda Cynon Taff were being monitored closely to see if further action was needed to prevent the ongoing spread of coronavirus. The first minister said it was important people carried on working from home if they could. Mr Drakeford told the BBC the rate of 20 people in 100,000 was the ""threshold we use for people to have to quarantine coming back into the UK"". He said if that figure fell, the advice on face masks could be looked at again. The new mask rule would come in from Monday to give people time to buy one, he said. Masks were not ""some sort of magic wand"" but ""a sensible addition to the precautionary measures we are taking"" to avert a crisis. This video can not be played Stop your glasses steaming up with a mask on Mr Drakeford said masks would not be mandatory in workplaces and said wearing them in school did ""not seem proportionate."" Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said the announcement ""was very welcome"" though the evidence on them was ""never going to be 100%."" Conservative Member of the Senedd, Darren Millar, said on Twitter his party had been calling for mandatory masks in shops since early July: ""On Wednesday we tabled a debate in the Welsh Parliament. Today, the Welsh Labour-led Government finally act."" The Federation of Small Businesses said it hoped the new mask rules would ""provide reassurance"" to shoppers. But it joined the shop workers union USDAW in urging customers to continue treating staff with respect. ""The move to make wearing face coverings mandatory is further proof there will be no immediate return to normal shopping,"" said Sara Jones, head of the Welsh Retail Consortium. Those working in towns and city centres have broadly welcomed the move to avoid another full lockdown. ""Businesses just need to know what they have to do to be able to open up and trade,"" said Kevin Ward, manager of the Newport Now business improvement district. ""Certain regulations have changed through the pandemic but what nobody wants is to have to go into a full lockdown again. For a lot of independent businesses and [chain stores], they would not survive another lockdown,"" he said. Kevin Ward said retailers needed to know what to do in order to trade Neil Butler, of teachers' union NASUWT, said he was worried about schools: ""The Welsh Government is positively saying no, we do not want face coverings in those particular environments."" Ministers said the restrictions on people meeting followed an increase in cases linked to people socialising indoors. Up to four households have been able to form an extended household and meet since late August. Until now, there has been no legal limit on how many people could gather. Mr Drakeford said the rule of up to 30 people being allowed to meet outdoors would include peoples' gardens. Bubble trouble? What can you now do in lockdown? New rules 'no longer than we have to' - Hancock Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales Children aged under 11 are not included in the six. The new rules on meeting indoors will not apply in Caerphilly county borough, whichwas put under local lockdown on Tuesday, where all extended household meetings are currently banned inside. Shoppers wearing face masks in Caerphilly, the first place in Wales to have a local lockdown The move comes after other parts of the UK also restricted meetings to six - but did so both indoors and outdoors. The UK government is restricting gatherings in England to just six peoplefrom Monday, with some exceptions. The number of people that can meet in Scotlandhas also been cut to six. Wales' coronavirus rules mean people can only be part of a single extended household, which cannot be changed once arranged. Despite the gradual easing of restrictions over the summer, meetings indoors with anyone outside your extended household have remained illegal. The recent rise in cases seen in Caerphilly county was blamed on people socialising in other people's homes in large numbers.

UK and Japan in first major post-Brexit trade dealSymbolic trade deal will cover 99% of UK exports to Japan but boost economy by just 0.07%.BusinessComments,"State for International Trade Liz Truss speaking to Japan""s Minister for Foreign Affairs Toshimitsu Motegi at the Department for International Trade The UK has struck its first major post-Brexit trade pact after signing a deal with Japan that aims to boost trade between the countries by about Â£15bn. International Trade Secretary Liz Truss said it was a ""historic moment"". She said it would bring ""new wins"" for British businesses in manufacturing, food and drink, and tech industries. Critics said while the deal may be of symbolic importance it would boost UK GDP by only 0.07%, a fraction of the trade that could be lost with the EU. Friday's deal still needs approval by Japan's parliament, which the country's Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi forecast would be passed by January. How many trade deals has the UK done? Ms Truss said the UK-Japan Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement means 99% of exports to Japan will be tariff-free. ""The agreement we have negotiated - in record time and in challenging circumstances - goes far beyond the existing EU deal, as it secures new wins for British businesses in our great manufacturing, food and drink, and tech industries,"" she said. ""From our automotive workers in Wales to our shoemakers in the North of England, this deal will help build back better as we create new opportunities for people throughout the whole of the UK and help level up our country."" She added that, strategically, the deal was an important step towards joining the Trans-Pacific Partnership and placing Britain at the centre of a network of free trade agreements. Major Japanese investors in the UK such as Nissan and Hitachi would benefit from reduced tariffs on parts coming from Japan and streamlined regulatory procedures, the UK's trade department statement said. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said Brexit gives Britain the freedom to strike trade deals with other countries around the world. Business leaders welcomed the agreement, but stressed that securing a deal with the EU remained the most important goal. The director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, Adam Marshall, called the announcement a milestone, but added: ""Whilst this agreement is undoubtedly cause for celebration, securing a Free Trade Agreement with the EU remains critical to the future of businesses in the UK. ""We urge ministers to redouble their efforts to reach a comprehensive partnership with our largest trading partner at a crucial time in the negotiations."" The CBI also hailed the agreement, with director general Carolyn Fairbairn saying this ""breakthrough moment"" can be the first of many. ""It's a huge opportunity to secure new Japanese investment across a wider range of sectors and UK regions,"" she said. You can almost hear the sighs of relief echoing around Westminster and within the business community. After weeks of wrangling, the first deal of the Brexit era has been struck, which ensures that 99% of British goods can enter Japan without tariffs, or extra charges. But ultimately, this deal largely mirrors the agreement which already exists between the EU and Japan. And with trade with Japan accounting for just 2% of the UK's total, the expected boost to GDP of 0.07% over the long term  is a tiny fraction of what might be lost from leaving the EU. And there is good reason for Japan cooperating to ensure this deal was secured in record time. It stands to get the lions share, 80%, of the total estimated Â£15bn boost to trade for both countries. Even then, the talks haven't been as speedy or straightforward as initially hoped - which may not bode well for  negotiations elsewhere. About 99% of exports between the two nations will be tariff-free under the deal, with a particular focus on the food and drink, finance and tech sectors. Manufacturing parts coming from Japan will benefit from reduced tariffs, as will British pork, beef and salmon travelling in the opposite direction. Japan's Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi said: ""It was a very tough negotiation, but we reached the agreement in principle in about three months, at an unusually fast pace. ""While maintaining the high levels of access to the British market under the Japan-EU EPA, we improved our access to the British market on train cars and some auto parts.""

"Saliva test study to help schools spot Covid casesScientists are investigating how pupils spread the virus, and whether they are symptomatic or not.Family & Education","Schools across Bristol will take part in the study A major research project to track coronavirus infections in schools and help head teachers prevent disruption is being piloted in Bristol. The study aims to understand exactly how pupils transmit the virus, whether or not they are symptomatic. The University of Bristol study will saliva-test 4,000 pupils and 1,000 staff from schools across the city once a month for six months. It should provide vital information on how schools should deal with outbreaks. It comes as some schools across the country have sent groups of pupils home to self-isolate after positive cases were found. Some have had to close temporarily for deep cleaning in an attempt to manage the risks. It is just a week or so since schools re-opened after a sixth-month gap due to lockdown. Experts say children are less susceptible to infection than adults, and their symptoms are generally milder. But more data is needed to fully understand the role children play in transmitting the virus. Schools 'no greater risk' for children and staff Williamson urges parents to send pupils to school Schools furious at 'last-minute' virus guidance Prof Caroline Relton, an epidemiologist at the University of Bristol, said researchers should be able to identify children with coronavirus, who do not show symptoms. She said: ""The main thrust of the study is to understand the rates of infections and to jump on them very quickly, so we're giving heads the tools to spot infections early and to keep their schools open, and so permit the continuity of education."" Prof Caroline Relton hopes the study will help minimise disruption to education Schools and the NHS Test and Trace system will receive the data to help map infections in the city. Researchers will also work with schools, looking at attendance data, seating plans and timetables to help them put appropriate measures in place. St Mary Redcliffe and Temple School in Bristol, where all pupils returned last week, is one of the first schools to become involved in the study. Ripley, in Year 10, is just starting her GCSEs and will be volunteering for a test. ""I want to take part in it because I think it would be really useful to get tested even if you don't have any of the symptoms, to be extra sure,"" she said. Reuben, in Year 8, thinks pupils might be surprised by a positive test but it would be useful to know. ""The benefits are you know you can take precautions. You can quickly isolate and help others stay safe and keep yourself safe."" Elijah, in Year 11, will take his GCSEs next summer and is keen that his year group faces the least possible disruption to their learning. ""We've had quite lot of months off school so keeping school open for our year right now is probably the best thing that can happen, so it will just mean a lot to everybody,"" he said. Head teacher Elisabeth Gilpin said: ""We were able to work with the scientists, to say: 'What do head teachers need to be able to keep their schools safe and to keep them open and to minimise the chance of closing?' ""So for us to get testing of a large percentage of the school population, even the asymptomatic people is just so exciting."" Head teacher Elisabeth Gilpin says she is excited the school is taking part in the study Staff have also welcomed being part of the study. Jean Miller, a receptionist at the school, is keen to take part: ""I've got grandchildren and I had glandular fever twice so my immune system isn't quite what it was and to know we have got the testing and we're as safe as we can possibly be is massively reassuring."" A second study, by academics at Imperial College, will carry out at a deeper investigation of a number of confirmed cases in schools. They aim to identify whether both symptomatic and asymptomatic children transmit the virus as well as looking at possible means of transmission both at school and within households. Both studies are funded by the National Institute for Health Research and UK Research and Innovation. SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? SUPPORT BUBBLES:What are they and who can be in yours?

EU trade talks hang in balance amid Brexit deal rowMinisters say they will not scrap plans to override withdrawal treaty despite pressure from some Tory MPs.UK PoliticsComments,"Boris Johnson has urged Conservative MPs to back his plan to override part of the Brexit withdrawal agreement. In a Zoom call with around 250 of them, he said the party must not return to ""miserable squabbling"" over Europe. The EU has warned the UK it could face legal action if it does not ditch controversial elements of the Internal Market Bill by the end of the month. And a Tory MP has proposed an amendment to the bill, which would affect trade between Britain and Northern Ireland. Meanwhile, the European Parliament has threatened to scupper any UK-EU trade deal if the bill becomes UK law. Analysis: Despite bitter Brexit row can deal still be done? UK signs first major post-Brexit trade deal Brexit to dominate week ahead in Parliament UK at odds with EU over approval for food exports The two sides have less than five weeks to agree a deal before Mr Johnson's 15 October deadline - after which he says he is prepared to ""walk away"". Informal talks are due to resume on Monday, with the next official round of talks - the ninth since March - starting in Brussels on 28 September. TheInternal Market Bill,external, which will be formally debated in the House of Commons for the first time on Monday, addresses the Northern Ireland Protocol - the part of the Brexit withdrawal agreement designed to prevent a hard border returning to the island of Ireland. If it became law it would give UK ministers powers to modify or ""disapply"" rules relating to the movement of goods between Britain and Northern Ireland that will come into force from 1 January, if the UK and EU are unable to strike a trade deal. The EU says the planned changes must be scrappedor they risk jeopardising the UK-EU trade talks. But the government has rejected this demand, arguing the measures in the bill are needed to protect the integrity of the UK and the peace process in Northern Ireland. Lords' anger over 'hypocritical' Brexit bill Kuenssberg: Brexit deal stand-off threatens trade talks How many trade deals has the UK done? In his Zoom call with MPs on Friday, the prime minister did not take questions and a poor signal meant the video and audio connections were lost for several minutes. He called for ""overwhelming support"" for the bill, describing it as ""absolutely vital"" to ""prevent a foreign or international body from having the power to break up our country"". Mr Johnson added that he would not countenance ""the threat of a border down the Irish Sea"". But he said there was still a ""very good chance"" of the UK and EU striking a deal by mid-October similar to that previouslyagreed between the EU and Canada- which got rid of most, but not all, tariffs on goods. BBC chief political correspondent Vicki Young said Tory MPs were ""looking for a sign of compromise"" from Mr Johnson, as they ""simply can't believe the government is prepared to break international law"", but the prime minister ""dug his heels in"". In a column in the Daily Telegraph,external, Mr Johnson accused the EU of reinterpreting the Withdrawal Agreement to ""destroy the economic and territorial integrity of the UK"" and ""endanger peace and stability in Northern Ireland"". ""I have to say that we never seriously believed that the EU would be willing to use a treaty, negotiated in good faith, to blockade one part of the UK, to cut it off,"" he said. Conservative backbencher Sir Bob Neill, who chairs the Commons Justice Committee, said he was not reassured by the prime minister's Zoom call. He is tabling an amendment to the bill to try to force a separate parliamentary vote on any changes to the Withdrawal Agreement. ""I believe it is potentially a harmful act for this country, it would damage our reputation and I think it will make it harder to strike trade deals going forward,"" he said. At around the same time as the prime minister was speaking, the European Parliament announced it would ""under no circumstances ratify"" any trade deal reached between the UK and EU if the ""UK authorities breach or threaten to breach"" the withdrawal agreement. Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis has admitted parts of the bill, which would go against a treaty signed by the UK and EU, would ""break international law in a very specific and limited way"". There is unease over this within the Conservative Party, with former leaders Theresa May, Lord Howard and Sir John Major urging Mr Johnson to think again.

"Over 500,000 flee 'unprecedented' Oregon fires","This video can not be played Drone footage shows homes completely wiped out by wildfires More than half a million people in the US state of Oregon are fleeing deadly wildfires that are raging across the Pacific Northwest, authorities say. Fanned by unusually hot, dry winds, dozens of fires are sweeping the state. At least one is being treated as suspected arson. Governor Kate Brown said the exact number of fatalities was not yet known, though at least four were confirmed. More than 100 wildfires are currently scorching 12 western US states. The worst affected are Oregon, California and Washington, where entire towns have been destroyed. In pictures: Oregon fires force thousands to flee Smoke from California wildfires turns skies orange False claims about Oregon fires spread online Some 4.4 million acres have been razed, according to the National Interagency Fire Center - an area larger than Connecticut and slightly smaller than Wales. On Thursday evening, the Oregon Office of Emergency Management confirmed the latest evacuation figures, which amount to more than 10% of the state's 4.2 million population. Gov Brown, a Democrat, said: ""We have never seen this amount of uncontained fire across the state... This will not be a one-time event. Unfortunately, it is the bellwether of the future. We're feeling the acute impacts of climate change."" While natural factors such as strong winds have helped the spread of these massive fires, the underlying heating of the climate from human activities is making these conflagrations bigger and more explosive. Nine of the world's 10 warmest years on record have occurred since 2005, and the UN warned this week that the five years from 2016 until this year will very likely be the hottest such period yet recorded. Both Oregon and California have warmed by more than 1C since 1900. The sustained warmth has seen six of the 20 largest fires on record in California all occur this year. In Oregon, the spate of fires has burned nearly twice the average annual losses in just the past week. In California, a prolonged drought over the past decade has killed millions of trees, turning them into potent fuel for the fires. Mountain regions that are normally cooler and wetter have dried out more rapidly in the summer, adding to the potential fuel load. Climate scientists had forecast that western wildfires would grow in size, scale and impact - but their predictions are coming to fruition faster than expected. A really simple guide to climate change The victims in Oregon include a 12-year-old boy and his grandmother, who died in a wildfire near Lyons, 70 miles (110km) south of Portland. Wyatt Tofte, his dog, and his grandmother Peggy Mosso died in the family car trying to escape the blaze. The child's mother was severely burnt. Lonnie Bertalotto, Ms Mosso's son and Wyatt's uncle, confirmed the deaths ina Facebook post,external. ""Don't take anything in life for granted and make the best of everyday,"" he wrote. Rich Tyler, a spokesman for the Oregon State Fire Marshal's office, told Reuters news agency: ""Every fire is investigated for the possibility of arson so that we can either determine it is or rule it out."" An infrared image shows destroyed homes in Phoenix, Oregon: burned vegetation and property appear grey, surviving vegetation is in red One of the most destructive blazes, the Almeda Fire, which started in Ashland near the California border, is being treated as suspicious. It has been linked to at least two deaths and destroyed hundreds of homes in the towns of Phoenix and Talent. The wildfires have also prompted mass evacuations in the suburbs of Portland, Oregon's largest city. Officials have set up 19 temporary shelters across the state for people fleeing the fires. Local news stationKOIN have published a list of the centres,external. More than 10% of Oregon's population are fleeing, according to the Oregon Office of Emergency Management Evacuation shelters have been asked to adopt ""policies to prevent the spread of Covid-19"", adding that authorities should try to set up dormitories of fewer than 50 people. Arelease said,externalanyone who spends time in a shelter should self-isolate once they leave as they may have been exposed to the virus. In Washington state, a one-year-old boy died and his parents were in a critical condition as they tried to escape the state's largest wildfire, in the northern county of Okanogan. A fire also destroyed most homes in the eastern town of Malden. This video can not be played Five ways that show the scale of California's 2020 wildfires In California, authorities in Butte County north of Sacramento have found 10 bodies in the last two days, and there are fears the toll will rise as 16 people remain unaccounted for. There, some 64,000 people were under evacuation orders while 14,000 firefighters battled 29 major fires. Sam Elm and her partner, Micah, lived in Phoenix, Oregon. Sam shared her experience fleeing from the wildfire - and saying goodbye to their home - with BBC OS. A fire started in a nearby town and began encroaching. ""It took our home,"" she says. ""It was an intense experience."" ""We were listening to the scanners... We were hearing it get closer and closer. ""At a certain point we got a call saying: 'You need to leave right now.' It was raining ash on - everything."" As they were about to leave, Sam says her wife called her upstairs to a wall in their home decorated with the signatures of friends, and members of their community - which Sam says was a ""point of pride"" for them. ""She slams her hand on the wall - because we've never signed our own wall, because it was our house we lived in - she traced her hand, she slammed my hand on the wall, she traced my hand, she kissed me and said: 'Don't forget this was our first home. And we left."" Sam Elm (left) and her wife Micah Elm had their first home burn down in a fire Sam adds that she and her wife were the lucky ones. ""Not everybody got to say goodbye to their homes - we did. Our pets are with us. We know people whose pets got stuck in their houses...we know people that are missing."" Sam and Micah are currently staying with a friend, hoping to get a hotel room through insurance. But she doesn't know what six months down the line looks like now that they've lost their home. She says she has no clue ""how to traverse any of this"".

Passenger stole Â£76k suitcase of designer clothes,"The court heard Hajar Al Fahad ""was trying to portray herself beyond her means"" A woman stole a passenger's suitcase containing Â£76,000 worth of designer clothes and jewellery from a train. Hajar Al Fahad, 26, learned the woman was wealthy after striking up a conversation with her on a London to south Wales train. She admitted taking the suitcase containing items by Chanel and Cartier as the train arrived at Cardiff Central station, the city's crown court heard. Al Fahad was given an eight-month prison sentence, suspended for a year. The suitcase contained ""extremely expensive designer items"" including a Chanel handbag, watches, Cartier necklaces, earrings, bracelets, and gold rings. It wasn't until she reached her destination 40 miles away in Swansea that the victim realised her suitcase was missing. Hajar Al Fahad's address was traced through her train ticket bought at Paddington station Prosecutor Andrew Davies said the pair began talking when Al Fahad placed her luggage on top of the victim's. Police traced the mother of two, of Llanrumney in Cardiff, through her purchase of a train ticket at London's Paddington station. Officers found the majority of the items from the suitcase, which came to a total value of Â£76,559. Hajar Al Fahad took photographs of herself wearing the items she had stolen A search of Al Fahad's mobile discovered internet searches for the items in the suitcase and photographs of herself wearing the items she had stolen. When questioned she said the suitcase was hers and later claimed the luxury goods inside were counterfeit. The court heard Al Fahad ""added an element of fantasy"" to her conversation with the woman on the train in September 2018, by claiming she was wealthy herself and had a cleaner. Mitigating, Tim Petrides said: ""She was trying to portray herself beyond her means and an element of fantasy came into the conversation. ""She has described her actions as a 'moment of madness' and in her own words to me, 'sorry is not enough'."" Hajar Al Fahad discovered her fellow passenger was wealthy in a chat on a London to Wales train Judge Catherine Richards said she accepted Al Fahad did not set out to steal from anyone but carried out an opportunistic theft. As well the suspended sentence, the defendant was ordered to carry out a 20-day rehabilitation activity requirement and 150 hours unpaid work.

UK and Japan in first major post-Brexit trade deal,"State for International Trade Liz Truss speaking to Japan""s Minister for Foreign Affairs Toshimitsu Motegi at the Department for International Trade The UK has struck its first major post-Brexit trade pact after signing a deal with Japan that aims to boost trade between the countries by about Â£15bn. International Trade Secretary Liz Truss said it was a ""historic moment"". She said it would bring ""new wins"" for British businesses in manufacturing, food and drink, and tech industries. Critics said while the deal may be of symbolic importance it would boost UK GDP by only 0.07%, a fraction of the trade that could be lost with the EU. Friday's deal still needs approval by Japan's parliament, which the country's Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi forecast would be passed by January. How many trade deals has the UK done? Ms Truss said the UK-Japan Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement means 99% of exports to Japan will be tariff-free. ""The agreement we have negotiated - in record time and in challenging circumstances - goes far beyond the existing EU deal, as it secures new wins for British businesses in our great manufacturing, food and drink, and tech industries,"" she said. ""From our automotive workers in Wales to our shoemakers in the North of England, this deal will help build back better as we create new opportunities for people throughout the whole of the UK and help level up our country."" She added that, strategically, the deal was an important step towards joining the Trans-Pacific Partnership and placing Britain at the centre of a network of free trade agreements. Major Japanese investors in the UK such as Nissan and Hitachi would benefit from reduced tariffs on parts coming from Japan and streamlined regulatory procedures, the UK's trade department statement said. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said Brexit gives Britain the freedom to strike trade deals with other countries around the world. Business leaders welcomed the agreement, but stressed that securing a deal with the EU remained the most important goal. The director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, Adam Marshall, called the announcement a milestone, but added: ""Whilst this agreement is undoubtedly cause for celebration, securing a Free Trade Agreement with the EU remains critical to the future of businesses in the UK. ""We urge ministers to redouble their efforts to reach a comprehensive partnership with our largest trading partner at a crucial time in the negotiations."" The CBI also hailed the agreement, with director general Carolyn Fairbairn saying this ""breakthrough moment"" can be the first of many. ""It's a huge opportunity to secure new Japanese investment across a wider range of sectors and UK regions,"" she said. You can almost hear the sighs of relief echoing around Westminster and within the business community. After weeks of wrangling, the first deal of the Brexit era has been struck, which ensures that 99% of British goods can enter Japan without tariffs, or extra charges. But ultimately, this deal largely mirrors the agreement which already exists between the EU and Japan. And with trade with Japan accounting for just 2% of the UK's total, the expected boost to GDP of 0.07% over the long term  is a tiny fraction of what might be lost from leaving the EU. And there is good reason for Japan cooperating to ensure this deal was secured in record time. It stands to get the lions share, 80%, of the total estimated Â£15bn boost to trade for both countries. Even then, the talks haven't been as speedy or straightforward as initially hoped - which may not bode well for  negotiations elsewhere. About 99% of exports between the two nations will be tariff-free under the deal, with a particular focus on the food and drink, finance and tech sectors. Manufacturing parts coming from Japan will benefit from reduced tariffs, as will British pork, beef and salmon travelling in the opposite direction. Japan's Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi said: ""It was a very tough negotiation, but we reached the agreement in principle in about three months, at an unusually fast pace. ""While maintaining the high levels of access to the British market under the Japan-EU EPA, we improved our access to the British market on train cars and some auto parts.""

Boat shows axed over virus fears with hours' notice,"The events had been expected to attract about 20,000 people to Southampton Public health officials have cancelled two boat shows hours before they were due to start over coronavirus fears. BOATS2020, and the smaller sailing show MDL Ocean Village, were due to start in Southampton on Friday, with an expected 20,000 visitors over the next 10 days. The organisers of BOATS2020 said they were told at about 18:30 BST that the event could not go ahead. Southampton City Council said the decision was ""regrettable"" but made with public safety in mind. Lesley Robinson, chief executive of British Marine, which organised BOATS2020, said she was ""desperately disappointed"" by the cancellation, ""especially receiving the news at the eleventh hour before opening"". She added: ""Alongside our exhibitors, we were ready to open a show that exceeded all safety requirements. We are truly perplexed as to why we are unable to run the show at least until Monday in line with the government restrictions imposed yesterday. ""Public health and safety come first and naturally, as the show organiser, British Marine must comply with all guidance."" British Marine's chief executive Lesley Robinson said she was ""desperately disappointed"" by the late cancellation So how many friends can I meet now? What are the rules on weddings? The quarantine lists have changed - what's new? About 230 boats had been brought to the city for the show. Southampton City Council's director of public health, Debbie Chase, said: ""In Southampton and the South East, we have seen a lower rate of COVID-19 transmissions since lockdown ended. ""However, the national picture shows a concerning rise in cases, and with these events set to attract around 20,000 people from different parts of the UK over a 10-day period, it's important we act now to reduce the risk of infection."" She added: ""The decision, while regrettable, has been made after detailed analysis of the public health risks and discussions with our colleagues and partner agencies within the city. COVID-19 is still very much with us and we all need to stay alert, particularly at this sensitive time."" Boat Show hosts 'amazing' launch.

Coronavirus cases on the rise in the UK,"Public health officials have warned of ""worrying signs"" of infection among the elderly, as an official measure indicated the UK's epidemic is growing again. The R number was raised to between 1 and 1.2 for the first time since March. Any number above one indicates the number of infections is increasing. The number of new daily confirmed UK cases of the virus rose to 3,539 on Friday - an increase of more than 600 on the previous day. The virus is still at much lower levels across the UK than at the peak in April, but a study of thousands of people in England found cases doubling every seven to eight days. It found a marked rise in infections in the north and among young people. Yvonne Doyle, medical director at Public Health England, said although younger people made up the greatest share of new cases, ""we're now starting to see worrying signs of infections occurring in the elderly, who are at far higher risk of getting seriously ill"". A PHE report says there has been ""a particularly steep increase"" in positive test results in the over-85s and, in the north-west of England, a rise in people from that age group being admitted to hospital. However, though cases are rising, the number of patients in hospital remains largely flat at 863. Of those, 78 are on ventilators, according to thelatest government figures,external. What are the new rules for meeting my friends? Behind the rise in Covid cases in five charts How do I get a coronavirus test? Ms Doyle warned people to follow social distancing rules, wash their hands regularly and wear a face covering in enclosed spaces. Meanwhile, Birmingham will become the latestarea to bring in new restrictions after a spike in cases. Tougher restrictions now cover more than 1.75m peoplein the west of Scotlandand, from Monday,face masks must be worn in shops in Wales. However,lockdown restrictions will be eased further in Leicester on Tuesdayto bring rules for businesses in the city more in line with the majority of England, the Department of Health said. The city has been subject to tighter Covid-19 restrictions since 29 June after a rise in cases. Across the UK,new laws on how many people can socialiseare being introduced from Monday in an attempt to hold back the rise in infections. The""rule of six""will restrict indoor and outdoor gatherings in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Police warned there was a ""real risk"" some people would treat this weekend as a ""party weekend"" before the new restrictions come in. John Apter, national chairman of the Police Federation of England and Wales, said that would be ""incredibly irresponsible"" at a time of increasing cases and officers would ""make no apology"" for fining people where appropriate. The rise in theR (reproduction) number- which describes how many others each infected person passes the virus on to - is one of several measures indicating the virus is spreading more widely in the UK. If the R number is higher than one - as now - the numbers infected are growing, with higher numbers indicating that cases are multiplying more quickly. Three other large studies have also indicated a widespread resurgence of coronavirus across the UK population. The UK is entering a new stage of the coronavirus pandemic. Since lockdown, we have been deciding how to react to falling cases. But now the R number has gone above the crucial level of 1 for the first time since March and is backed up by reams of data showing cases are growing again. This is not just contained to hotspots like Bolton - one government adviser told me the rise was widespread across the country. They said today was a ""wake-up call"" for the nation. There are already some signs that the number of people being admitted to hospital is starting to rise. But this is not a repeat of the build-up to lockdown. Cases are at a much lower level and they are growing more slowly. Pre-lockdown, the R number was around three and cases were doubling every three to four days. It is around half that now. Coronavirus is going to be a major challenge until we have a vaccine. So the defining question as we head into a potentially difficult winter is how to balance keeping the virus in check with getting on with our lives. The REACT study,externalof more than 150,000 volunteers in England, one of the three new sources of data on community levels, found ""accelerating transmission"" at the end of August and start of September. It said levels of infection were rising across England but particularly in the north east, north west and Yorkshire. Merseyside 'becomes an area of concern' Tyneside and Wearside areas added to Covid list Lockdown restrictions extended to Lanarkshire And there were increases in positive cases in all age groups up to the age of 65, with highest rates of growth in 18-24 year olds. Prof Paul Elliott, director of the study at Imperial College London, said the data clearly showed ""a concerning trend in coronavirus infections"" where cases are growing quickly across England and ""no longer concentrated in key workers"". He said there was evidence of ""an epidemic in the community"" which was not the result of more people being tested. The second set of data, from the Office for National Statistics (ONS),externalestimates there were 39,700 new cases of the virus in England during the first week in September - 11,000 more than the previous week. The ONS bases its figures on thousands of swab tests carried out in households, whether people have symptoms or not. It estimated no increase in cases for the same week in Wales,but First Minister Mark Drakeford has announced people must now wear face masks in shopsin response to rising case numbers in recent days. Katherine Kent, from the ONS infection survey, said the results suggested ""an increase in Covid-19 infections in England during recent weeks, with higher infection rates among 17-34 year olds"". Nicola Sturgeon has warned thatthe average number of cases in Scotland has been ""more than trebling every three weeks""with some areas of particular concern, including Lanarkshire and Greater Glasgow and Clyde. And the third set of figures, fromthe Covid symptom study app,external, which tracks the health of nearly four million people in the UK, also suggests a growth in new cases since the end of August - the first time since mid-June there has been a significant rise in numbers. Prof James Naismith, from the University of Oxford, said younger people would also have been affected to the same extent in January if testing had been available. ""We know that medical treatment and scientific advances have improved significantly, thus even with infection rates as bad as March and April, there will be many fewer deaths. ""The more people wash their hands and practise social distancing - especially by and around the vulnerable - the lower the number of deaths and illness we will see,"" he said.

How does Test and Trace work?,"Self-isolation rules are changing in some parts of the UK for fully vaccinated adults and children under 18. If they are identified as a close contact of someone who's tested positive for Covid, they may soon be able to take a PCR test rather than self-isolate for 10 days. You mustself-isolate for 10 daysif you: test positive for Covid-19 live with someone who tests positive are approached by text, email or phone by contact tracers who identify you as a close contact of someone who has tested positive arrive in the UK from ared list country,external arrive in the UK from France arrive from any otheramber list country,externaland you are 18 or over, and have not been vaccinated You must also self-isolate if you or someone you live with hasCovid symptoms. You can stop self-isolating if the person with symptoms gets a negative PCR result. Each UK nation has its own contact-tracing service: England -NHS Test and Trace,external Scotland -Test and Protect,external Wales -Test, Trace, Protect,external Northern Ireland -Contact tracing service,external When peopletest positive,externalfor coronavirus, they are asked to provide details of their close contacts. These include: people they've spent at least 15 minutes with, at a distance of less than 2m (6ft) sexual partners, people they live with or have had face-to-face conversations with, at a distance of less than 1m (3ft) If you are deemed a close contact, other people in your household don't have to self-isolate unless you or they develop symptoms. Scotland From 9 August, fully vaccinated adults identified as close contacts of someone who tested positive for Covid will no longer have to self-isolate for 10 days. Instead, if they have no symptoms and at least two weeks have passed since the second dose, they can get a PCR test. If the result is negative, self-isolation can then be ended. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced a similar change - with a negative PCR result - for people aged 17 or under. Children under the age of five will be encouraged, but not required, to take a PCR test. England From 16 August,external, fully vaccinated adults and all under-18s contacted by NHS Test and Trace (not the app) will be advisedto take one PCR testas soon as possible. As long as that is negative, and they don't develop symptoms, they won't need to take further action. Wales Similar changes will happen in Walesfrom 7 August,external. However, people will be also advised to take PCR test on day two and day eight, whether they are fully vaccinated or not. Northern Ireland Ministers in Northern Ireland are expectedto discuss changes on 12 August. Any adult not fully vaccinated will still need to isolate if they are identified as contacts. Anyone who tests positive - regardless of age, vaccination status, or whether or not they have symptoms - will also still need to self-isolate. TheNHS Covid app,externalis available to download in England and Wales. If you have the app, and you spend enough time close to another person using it, you will receive a ""ping"" alert if they later test positive for Covid. You need to be within 2m (6ft) of them for 15 minutes to trigger the alert. Northern IrelandandScotlandhave separate apps. If you are ""pinged"" you're advised - but not legally obliged -to self-isolate for 10 days. Government ministers have said it is ""crucial""  that people self-isolate when sent an alert. However, it's feared that the large number of people being alerted has led tomany users deleting the app. Currently, when someone tested positive but had no symptoms, the NHS Covid app went back five days before the test, and alerted any close contacts during that time. However, the app will soon only alert close contactsfrom the previous two days before the positive test. The sensitivity of the app itself has not changed, and anyone testing positive will still have to self-isolate. In the week to 28 July, nearly 396,000 people in England and Wales received alerts from the app, a sharp drop from 690,000 the week before. In England, employers providing critical services can now request an exemption for named employees who are fully vaccinated.Sectors include energy and emergency services,external. Supermarket depot workers and food manufacturers are among those exempt from quarantine rules whatever their vaccination status. A similar system is being launched in Scotland. AÂ£500 grant is available,externalin England to people on low incomes who have to self-isolate. This includes parents who can't work because their child has to self-isolate. However, manyapplications have been turned down. In Scotland people can apply for theSelf-Isolation Support Grant,external, worth Â£500, and there isa similar scheme in Wales,external. In Northern Irelanda discretionary payment is available.,external You may also be entitled toStatutory Sick Pay,external, which is worth Â£96.35 a week, or more if your employer has a sick pay scheme.

Behind the rise in Covid cases in five charts,"The government says there is ""high demand"" for coronavirus tests Officials are alarmed by the latest rise in coronavirus cases. Newly diagnosed cases have topped 2,000 for the past three days. The average rate of new infections is now four times higher than it was in mid-July. The rise is real, but is it quite as sharp as it looks? Here are five things to consider. The confirmed cases chart is one we have all got used to. It shows the number of positive Covid-19 tests a day. In April, there were days when 6,000 new cases a day were recorded, so the level of infections in the past few days appears to be some way towards that peak. But at the start of the pandemic, the UK was only largely able to test hospital patients. There was limited testing capacity. This targeted testing meant infections in the community were completely missed, whereas now we have mass testing in the community. It means that if we compare numbers now to numbers during the peak, we are essentially comparing apples with pears. Estimates from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine suggest there may have been as many as 100,000 cases a day at the end of March. Mass testing in the community only started in the second half of May. Clearly not all cases are now being picked up, although the surveillance programme run by the Office for National Statistics suggests a large proportion are, whereas earlier in the pandemic maybe only 5% of cases were being detected. So while cases may be rising, the level of infection being seen is still very low compared with the peak. Even after mass testing was launched, the number of tests carried out on a daily and weekly basis has still been increasing. This is because more testing centres have opened and lab capacity to process the tests has increased. It means we are able to look more closely for virus circulating in the community than we were when mass testing first started. If you look at the trend solely in terms of positive cases, the pattern looks like this: But we have to factor in that big increase in testing - there has been an 80% rise since mid-June. When you adjust for the numbers of tests carried out and calculate the percentage of positive tests, the trend looks more like this: The rise seems to be smaller, slower and to have happened more recently. How do I get a coronavirus test? Cases are rising, what should I do? What is the R number and how is it calculated? The increase in testing capacity means the government now has a flexible army of testing facilities. A network of more than 100 mobile units can be dispatched around the country. And despite the current problems with lab capacity, which have meant some people in some places have struggled to get a test, resources are still being focused on areas with the highest rates. Random testing in neighbourhoods has also started in hotspot areas, with people offered tests even if they don't have symptoms. By looking in areas with highest rates of infection, you are more likely to get positive tests. It is telling that over the past week to Sunday, a quarter of new cases were in the 20 local authority areas with the highest rates. They represent just 5% of total local authorities. Over the past few days hospital admissions have started to slowly tick up - though not as much as cases, and it's too soon to know if this is statistically significant. They are a small fraction of the number of admissions back in March, and they are rising much more gradually than they were around the peak. One theory is that more testing is uncovering a larger number of mild cases which don't need treatment. Another is that more of the cases are among younger people, who are less likely to become very ill. But the rise suggests the virus could be taking hold in the community again, and could quickly escalate. Public Health England data shows people in the 20-39 age bracket are testing positive at higher rates than any other age group, and at higher rates than they were earlier in the pandemic. What's harder to say is why that is. It could be behavioural or demographic - that younger people are more likely to have to go out to work, have public facing jobs, live in shared housing and go out to socialise. But it could also be a function of how eligibility for testing has expanded. Younger age groups are much less likely to get seriously sick with coronavirus, and so earlier this year would not have found themselves in hospital where they would have been tested.

Covid-19 tracing app is released in NI,"The app automatically contacts anyone at risk of infection Northern Ireland has become the first part of the UK to launch an app for tracking and tracing coronavirus. Named StopCOVID NI, it has several features for logging details of those experiencing symptoms of the virus. The app will run alongside a phone-based contact tracing programme already in place and will identify those at risk of infection. It has been released for download from Apple's App Store and on Google Play. StopCOVID NI will be officially launched on Friday but became available to download on Thursday afternoon. Within an hour of its release, hundreds of people had installed it on their mobile phones. Robin Swann urged people to download the app Northern Ireland Health Minister Robin Swann said that the more people that downloaded the app, the more effective a tool it would be in the local coronavirus response. ""This could be the most important thing you do all year,"" he said. ""It could prevent you from spreading the virus to people you care about."" After a positive Covid-19 test result, a person will receive a unique code by text message. That message will invite the person to enter the code if they use the app. This video can not be played WATCH: What is contact tracing and how does it work? Entering the code will trigger a ""Bluetooth handshake"", allowing the app to notify any other user who has been nearby for long enough to be at risk of infection. ""There will be some people who won't be able to or won't want to use the app, and that's okay,"" said Dan West, the chief digital information officer at the NI Department of Health. ""The more people who do use it, the more protection this will provide to the whole community. We can say that for sure."" The app is intended for over-18s initially because of a conflict between data protection laws and the need for identifiable safeguarding consent. The Health and Social Care Board is meeting the children's commissioner, the information commissioner's office and the Children's Law Centre to find a way through that. The Department of Health says the app will work better as the number of downloads increase Analysis: BBC News technology correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones There's been a lot of talk of the importance of getting contact tracing apps to work across borders - but between them Northern Ireland and the Republic have done it, a world first. Their apps, built by the same developer, were designed to be compatible but what was vital was an agreement to share databases of the people who test positive for the virus. What we still don't know is whether the app will work - as yet. There's not enough evidence from around the world to show that a technology-driven approach to contact tracing is effective. But the NHS in England, which abandoned its first app to switch to the decentralised model used by StopCOVID NI, will be watching closely what happens in Northern Ireland. Robin Swannpreviously said his department was working with its counterpart in the Republic of Ireland. The ambition was to have the two systems work in tandem, so information about contacts who need to be traced can be shared by both governments. Both apps have been designed by the same company, Nearform. On Thursday one more death was recorded in the Republic of Ireland, taking its death toll to 1,764. An additional 85 confirmed cases were also reported to the Republic's Department of Health. Privacy settings are laid out in the set-up menu of the app The contact tracing programme has been operational in Northern Ireland since mid-May. The great coronavirus-tracing apps mystery It involves people with a positive test result being contacted by phone. The people they have been within 2m of for 15 minutes or more are called and advised about isolating or being tested if they have symptoms. The app is an add-on to that, to help with contact tracing, and alert those who may not be easily contacted. Q&A: What is NI's contact tracing plan?

"Scotland's app downloaded almost 600,000 times","The app can be downloaded free onto a mobile phone More than 600,000 people have downloaded Scotland's new contact tracing app since it went live. It became available to download free on to a smart phone from Apple's App Store or Google Play on Thursday. The Protect Scotland app lets people know if they have been in close contact with someone who later tests positive. The Scottish government has said the software will support the Test and Protect system and is ""another tool in the fight against Covid-19"". Up until now, contact tracing has been done manually using a method followed for years to help control the spread of infectious diseases. How does Scotland's new contact tracing app work? How to download Scotland's contact tracing app,external Coronavirus in Scotland: Where are the latest cases? First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has urged as many people as possible to get involved in the new tracing scheme. Speaking in the Holyrood chamber on Thursday afternoon, she said: ""The more people that sign up the better. Everybody who signs up is making a contribution."" She told MSPs that the number of people who had downloaded the app had stood at 150,000 before she left her office to speak in parliament. During First Minister's Questions, she said the number had climbed to 200,000 since she had taken to her feet, which she described as ""very positive"". By 12:15 on Friday, that had risen above 600,000. Scotland has followed Northern Ireland in choosing to use the toolkit provided by Apple and Google to build a contact tracing app which has privacy built in. Both have moved quickly by using the software developed for Ireland's app. Scotland did at first seem inclined to work with the NHSX England app team, which for months pursued a centralised app collecting more data, without the co-operation of the tech giants. But seeing some knotty technical issues with the English app they then decided to follow many other countries going down the Apple/Google route. One person close to the Scottish project said ""using something that the tech giants had created was easier than trying to create stuff ourselves"". England also eventually changed tack and hasbeen testing an app based on the Apple Google toolkit for the last monthon the Isle of Wight and the London borough of Newham. But there's still no word on a national rollout - and it seems England, which once saw a contact tracing app as a vital weapon in the battle against the virus, is now happy to be a follower rather than a leader in this technology. With 64,000 downloads by 09:00 on launch day, the Test and Protect team feel their app has got away to a good start - but the real question is whether it will help speed up warnings to people who may have been close to someone infected with the virus. It will be weeks before we know whether the app is an effective tool. Some iPhone users have reported not being able to download the app because they are not running iOS 13. The iPhone 6 and older models launched before 2015 cannot run Apple's latest operating system. Android phone users will also need to be running at least the Android 6.0 operating system, which was launched in 2015,the Protect.scot website says,external. Asked at First Minister's Questions about people who did not use smartphones, Ms Sturgeon said the more people who used the app, the more effective it would be. But the first minister told MSPs that the Scottish government had not based its entire test and protect system on a proximity tracing app. ""We've built it from the bottom up using tried and tested approaches in our public health teams and the app is an enhancement to that,"" she said. ""So if you don't have a phone, if you don't use the app, you will not be missed from our test and protect system."" Research by Ofcom from 2017,externalsuggested that about 3.2m adults in Scotland owned a smartphone. The new app uses Bluetooth technology to alert users if they have been in prolonged close contact with someone who subsequently tests positive for Covid-19. When an individual initially tests positive for the virus, they are contacted by phone in the usual way. The contact tracer will ask them if they are an app user and if they are willing to use the app's upload function to anonymously alert close contacts. If they agree, they will be sent a unique code to their mobile which unlocks this function on the app. By sharing their positive test result in this way, the information will form part of an anonymous database. The app on other users' phones regularly checks this database to see if they have been in contact with an infected person. A warning is automatically issued when a match is found and users are then urged to get tested or self-isolate for 14 days. IMPACT:How is the pandemic affecting life in Scotland?

Government office failed to enforce distancing,"Concerns were raised over social distancing at the Department for Work and Pensions office in Leeds A government office failed to do enough to prevent the spread of coronavirus, a health and safety inspection found. Workers were pictured gathered around a desk at the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) in Leeds where there have been two confirmed Covid-19 cases. The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) found management had failed to ensure social distancing was maintained. The DWP said it had taken ""urgent action to rectify all issues identified"" at the Quarry House office. During the pandemic, the majority of DWP employees in Leeds have been working from home but there have still been hundreds of people in the office, located inside a landmark building on the eastern edge of the city centre. There has been a recruitment drive at the DWP amida rise in Universal Credit claimants due to coronavirus, a whistleblower told the BBC. Quarry House in Leeds is known locally as ""The Kremlin"" because of its imposing architecture The whistleblower has been working at home for the DWP but said he was concerned for his health when returning to the building, which is also home to parts of the NHS. He said: ""I hear stories about people congregating, not following outlaid guidance. In an office so big it is difficult to monitor 24/7. ""People I have spoken to are nervous about a return, they and I feel it is not yet safe enough to go back. ""The office was busy pre-Covid, I don't know where everyone would operate from in normal times let alone in a virus outbreak."" So how many friends can I meet now? 'We must act' to prevent second lockdown - PM Five ways to avoid catching coronavirus indoors What's the latest with the furlough scheme? The HSE inspected the office on 27 August after receiving a report of a ""workplace concern"". During the visit photographs were taken, including one of workers standing close together. The report compiled following the inspection said: ""You are failing to ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, the health and safety of your employees/agency staff at work because you have not implemented necessary measures to prevent the spread of Covid-19."" The DWP had risk assessed for the office being about 50% full, which the HSE said ""may be ambitious and unrealistic"", leading to a risk of ""congestion"" and making it more difficult to maintain social distancing. A line manager gave instruction to a group of staff around a desk, with staff not following social distancing Walkways had been designated as two-way travel despite only being about a metre wide Walkways passed closely to desks designated as usable Stairwells were designated as two-way travel but did not appear to be sufficiently wide for 2m distancing - even at designated passing points Small tables, ""breakout pods"" and benches lacked ""do not use"" signage. The BBC has seen leaked messages showing the office has had at least two positive coronavirus cases among staff. Two emails have recently been sent to workers saying people had been sent home from the affected floors and deep cleans carried out. Charles Law, industrial officer with the PCS union, said: ""It's extremely worrying for our members who work for the department, especially if they're expected to stop being at home and come into the workplace. ""It's shocking that the HSE would do such a damning report on a flagship DWP office and we're extremely concerned for the safety of our members."" SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? JOBS:How will I be kept safe at work? SUPPORT BUBBLES:What are they and who can be in yours? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? TESTING:What tests are available? The HSE confirmed that following the visit an official letter, known as a Notification of Contravention, was sent to the DWP. In this letter, the DWP was warned a fee would need to be paid because of ""material breaches"" of health and safety law. It was given a deadline of Tuesday 15 September to confirm action had been taken to remedy the issues highlighted in the report. In a statement, a DWP spokesperson said: ""We take the health and safety of staff extremely seriously and have implemented Covid-secure measures across our sites to ensure they comply with government guidelines.

MPs want furlough extended to minimise job losses,"The UK government should consider a targeted extension of its furlough scheme, MPs have said. The coronavirus crisis risks mass long-term unemployment and viable firms could go under without support, the Treasury Select Committee has warned. However, a blanket retention of the scheme would not be good value for money, it added. The Treasury said it would ""continue to innovate in supporting incomes and employment."" The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme is due to end on 31 October. Under it, workers placed on leave have received 80% of their pay up to a maximum of Â£2,500 a month. At first, this was all paid for by the government. Butfirms had to start making a contribution to wagesin September as the scheme began to wind down. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has previously said that extending furlough past October would only keep people ""in suspended animation"". Chancellor Rishi Sunak also ruled out an extension, instead saying thatfirms will be given Â£1,000 for every furloughed workerstill in employment at the end of January. Coronavirus: What happens when the furlough scheme ends? Extend furlough scheme 'or risk second wave of job cuts' But the committee's chairman, Mel Stride, said the chancellor ""should carefully consider targeted extensions"" to the scheme. ""The key will be assisting those businesses who, with additional support, can come through the crisis as sustainable enterprises, rather than focusing on those that will unfortunately just not be viable in the changed post-crisis economy."" In the second report of its inquiry into the economic impact of Covid-19, the committee also warned that the pandemic risked widening the gender pay gap due to the differences in hours of paid work in lockdown - especially if work patterns are changed permanently. The MPs also said people should be able to reskill, and that small businesses should be able to fully participate in the government's Kickstart Scheme, which aims to create work placements for young people on universal credit. The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) trade body said with the furlough scheme winding down, ""policymakers will need to look closely at measures to stem mass unemployment, including a successor scheme."" FSB national chairman Mike Cherry said: ""The priority should be protecting viable small businesses - and all the jobs they provide - that have been disproportionately [hit] by the coronavirus crisis, including those caught by local lockdowns, subject to continued national restrictions, or with staff that have directly suffered because of Covid."" This video can not be played Julie changed jobs before lockdown - then became unemployed and ineligible for the furlough scheme The Resolution Foundation, which campaigns on living standards, said that ""extending support for the hardest-hit sectors of the economy will be essential to limit the rise in unemployment Britain faces in the months ahead."" Torsten Bell, the think tank's chief executive, said: ""This authoritative account of the economic impact of coronavirus should be required reading for Treasury officials planning the Autumn Budget against the highly uncertain backdrop of rising coronavirus case numbers. ""The chancellor will need to reconsider his plans to swiftly phase out support given the painful reality that the economic crisis is here to stay."" This week leading business groups warned that the UKrisks a second wave of job cutsand a slower economic recovery if it does not extend its furlough scheme. Germany, Belgium, Australia and France have all decided to extend or launch new wage support schemes into next year. Former Labour prime minister Gordon Brown told the BBC that the UK should emulate other countries' short-term working schemes. Mr Brown said the end of the furlough scheme on 31 October was a ""cliff-edge"" that could trigger ""a tsunami of unemployment"". ""The government's got to change course here,"" he told the Today programme. Short-term working schemes would allow firms to reduce employees' working hours while keeping them in jobs, with the state topping up their salaries. ""You have got to send a signal that unemployment matters,"" he said. ""We don't want to destroy any more capacity and skills in the economy."" A Treasury spokesperson said that by the time the UK scheme closes it will have helped to pay for 9.6 million jobs. ""We will continue to innovate in supporting incomes and employment,"" the spokesperson said. ""We're helping employees get back to work, where they want to be, through a Â£1,000 retention bonus. ""And we are creating new roles for young people with our Kickstart Scheme, creating incentives for training and apprenticeships, and supporting and protecting jobs in the tourism and hospitality sectors through our VAT cut and last month's Eat Out to Help Out scheme."" The UK's unemployment rate has been at 3.9% since the lockdown was introduced. But the Bank of England expects that rate to double to 7.5% by the end of the year when the government-funded support schemes come to an end. Thousands of job cuts have already been announced by firm such as Rolls-Royce, Costa Coffee, Pret A Manger, Pizza Express, British Airways and BP.

How could the recession affect me?,"The UK is out of recession after the economy returned to growth in the first three months of the year, official figures show. Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said the economy was ""returning to full health"", but Labour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said this was no time for a ""victory lap"". The Office for National Statistics (ONS) publishes figures for the UK's Gross Domestic Product (GDP). This is the value of all the goods and services the UK produces. When GDP rises, a country's economy grows and average incomes rise as a result. But sometimes the economy shrinks, GDP falls, and that's a sign that the economy is doing badly, which could hit people's pockets. What is GDP and how does it affect me? The UK is in recession if GDP falls for two successive three-month periods - known as quarters. The economy shrank 0.1% between July and September last year and then by a further 0.3% between October and December. This meantthe economy went into recession at the end of 2023. But the latest figures from the ONS show the UK economy grew by 0.6% between January and March 2024, marking the end of the recession. Is Rishi Sunak keeping his five key promises? Theprevious UK recession was in 2020, at the height of the coronavirus pandemic. It only lasted for six months, although the 20.4% fall in GDP recorded between April and June 2020 was the largest on record. In 2008 a recession started as a result of the global financial crisis, and went on for five quarters, or 15 months. Economic growth can mean more jobs are available and companies can pay more to employees and shareholders. Higher wages and larger profits also generate money for the government through taxes. It can chooseto spend more on things like benefits and public services, or cut tax rates. When the economy shrinks and a country goes into recession, these things can go into reverse. Some people might lose their jobs, and unemployment could rise. Others may find it harder to be promoted, or to get big enough pay rises to keep pace with price increases. However, the pain of a recession is typically not felt equally across society, and inequality can increase. Benefit recipients and those on fixed incomes are particularly likely to struggle, especially if the government decides to spend less on public services. In a recession,the Bank of England - which is independent of government - typically cuts interest rates. This makes it cheaper for businesses and households to borrow money which can boost spending and economic growth. However,prices have been rising very quickly in the UK, and the Bank put interest rates up to tackle that inflation. After 14 rate increases,the Bank hasheld interest rates at 5.25% six times in a row. When the economy is struggling to grow at the same time as there is high inflation, there can be a situation called ""stagflation"". This can be very difficult to solve, because the two issues require different solutions. However in May 2024, Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey told the BBC thatthe UK economy had ""turned a corner"". With growth of 0.6% from January to March this year, the UK was the joint fastest growing economy inthe G7 group of industrialised nations. But until then, the UK had been one of the weaker members of the G7. The US economygrew by 3.3% in the fourth quarter of 2023, which was much better than expected. That put the US at 2.5% over 2023 as a whole, the best performance of all other advanced economies. It is also expected to outperform the rest of the G7 in 2024. In October 2023,the International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicted that the UK would grow by just 0.6% in 2024. The independentOffice for Budget Responsibility (OBR)expects the UK economy to grow by 0.7% in 2024, but that is less than half of its earlier prediction of 1.8% growth.

"Coronavirus cases on the rise in EnglandNew estimates show cases increasing since the end of August, particularly among young people.Health","Public health officials have warned of ""worrying signs"" of infection among the elderly, as an official measure indicated the UK's epidemic is growing again. The R number was raised to between 1 and 1.2 for the first time since March. Any number above one indicates the number of infections is increasing. The number of new daily confirmed UK cases of the virus rose to 3,539 on Friday - an increase of more than 600 on the previous day. The virus is still at much lower levels across the UK than at the peak in April, but a study of thousands of people in England found cases doubling every seven to eight days. It found a marked rise in infections in the north and among young people. Yvonne Doyle, medical director at Public Health England, said although younger people made up the greatest share of new cases, ""we're now starting to see worrying signs of infections occurring in the elderly, who are at far higher risk of getting seriously ill"". A PHE report says there has been ""a particularly steep increase"" in positive test results in the over-85s and, in the north-west of England, a rise in people from that age group being admitted to hospital. However, though cases are rising, the number of patients in hospital remains largely flat at 863. Of those, 78 are on ventilators, according to thelatest government figures,external. What are the new rules for meeting my friends? Behind the rise in Covid cases in five charts How do I get a coronavirus test? Ms Doyle warned people to follow social distancing rules, wash their hands regularly and wear a face covering in enclosed spaces. Meanwhile, Birmingham will become the latestarea to bring in new restrictions after a spike in cases. Tougher restrictions now cover more than 1.75m peoplein the west of Scotlandand, from Monday,face masks must be worn in shops in Wales. However,lockdown restrictions will be eased further in Leicester on Tuesdayto bring rules for businesses in the city more in line with the majority of England, the Department of Health said. The city has been subject to tighter Covid-19 restrictions since 29 June after a rise in cases. Across the UK,new laws on how many people can socialiseare being introduced from Monday in an attempt to hold back the rise in infections. The""rule of six""will restrict indoor and outdoor gatherings in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Police warned there was a ""real risk"" some people would treat this weekend as a ""party weekend"" before the new restrictions come in. John Apter, national chairman of the Police Federation of England and Wales, said that would be ""incredibly irresponsible"" at a time of increasing cases and officers would ""make no apology"" for fining people where appropriate. The rise in theR (reproduction) number- which describes how many others each infected person passes the virus on to - is one of several measures indicating the virus is spreading more widely in the UK. If the R number is higher than one - as now - the numbers infected are growing, with higher numbers indicating that cases are multiplying more quickly. Three other large studies have also indicated a widespread resurgence of coronavirus across the UK population. The UK is entering a new stage of the coronavirus pandemic. Since lockdown, we have been deciding how to react to falling cases. But now the R number has gone above the crucial level of 1 for the first time since March and is backed up by reams of data showing cases are growing again. This is not just contained to hotspots like Bolton - one government adviser told me the rise was widespread across the country. They said today was a ""wake-up call"" for the nation. There are already some signs that the number of people being admitted to hospital is starting to rise. But this is not a repeat of the build-up to lockdown. Cases are at a much lower level and they are growing more slowly. Pre-lockdown, the R number was around three and cases were doubling every three to four days. It is around half that now. Coronavirus is going to be a major challenge until we have a vaccine. So the defining question as we head into a potentially difficult winter is how to balance keeping the virus in check with getting on with our lives. The REACT study,externalof more than 150,000 volunteers in England, one of the three new sources of data on community levels, found ""accelerating transmission"" at the end of August and start of September. It said levels of infection were rising across England but particularly in the north east, north west and Yorkshire. Merseyside 'becomes an area of concern' Tyneside and Wearside areas added to Covid list Lockdown restrictions extended to Lanarkshire And there were increases in positive cases in all age groups up to the age of 65, with highest rates of growth in 18-24 year olds. Prof Paul Elliott, director of the study at Imperial College London, said the data clearly showed ""a concerning trend in coronavirus infections"" where cases are growing quickly across England and ""no longer concentrated in key workers"". He said there was evidence of ""an epidemic in the community"" which was not the result of more people being tested.

"Coronavirus cases on the rise in EnglandNew estimates show cases increasing since the end of August, particularly among young people.","Public health officials have warned of ""worrying signs"" of infection among the elderly, as an official measure indicated the UK's epidemic is growing again. The R number was raised to between 1 and 1.2 for the first time since March. Any number above one indicates the number of infections is increasing. The number of new daily confirmed UK cases of the virus rose to 3,539 on Friday - an increase of more than 600 on the previous day. The virus is still at much lower levels across the UK than at the peak in April, but a study of thousands of people in England found cases doubling every seven to eight days. It found a marked rise in infections in the north and among young people. Yvonne Doyle, medical director at Public Health England, said although younger people made up the greatest share of new cases, ""we're now starting to see worrying signs of infections occurring in the elderly, who are at far higher risk of getting seriously ill"". A PHE report says there has been ""a particularly steep increase"" in positive test results in the over-85s and, in the north-west of England, a rise in people from that age group being admitted to hospital. However, though cases are rising, the number of patients in hospital remains largely flat at 863. Of those, 78 are on ventilators, according to thelatest government figures,external. What are the new rules for meeting my friends? Behind the rise in Covid cases in five charts How do I get a coronavirus test? Ms Doyle warned people to follow social distancing rules, wash their hands regularly and wear a face covering in enclosed spaces. Meanwhile, Birmingham will become the latestarea to bring in new restrictions after a spike in cases. Tougher restrictions now cover more than 1.75m peoplein the west of Scotlandand, from Monday,face masks must be worn in shops in Wales. However,lockdown restrictions will be eased further in Leicester on Tuesdayto bring rules for businesses in the city more in line with the majority of England, the Department of Health said. The city has been subject to tighter Covid-19 restrictions since 29 June after a rise in cases. Across the UK,new laws on how many people can socialiseare being introduced from Monday in an attempt to hold back the rise in infections. The""rule of six""will restrict indoor and outdoor gatherings in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Police warned there was a ""real risk"" some people would treat this weekend as a ""party weekend"" before the new restrictions come in. John Apter, national chairman of the Police Federation of England and Wales, said that would be ""incredibly irresponsible"" at a time of increasing cases and officers would ""make no apology"" for fining people where appropriate. The rise in theR (reproduction) number- which describes how many others each infected person passes the virus on to - is one of several measures indicating the virus is spreading more widely in the UK. If the R number is higher than one - as now - the numbers infected are growing, with higher numbers indicating that cases are multiplying more quickly. Three other large studies have also indicated a widespread resurgence of coronavirus across the UK population. The UK is entering a new stage of the coronavirus pandemic. Since lockdown, we have been deciding how to react to falling cases. But now the R number has gone above the crucial level of 1 for the first time since March and is backed up by reams of data showing cases are growing again. This is not just contained to hotspots like Bolton - one government adviser told me the rise was widespread across the country. They said today was a ""wake-up call"" for the nation. There are already some signs that the number of people being admitted to hospital is starting to rise. But this is not a repeat of the build-up to lockdown. Cases are at a much lower level and they are growing more slowly. Pre-lockdown, the R number was around three and cases were doubling every three to four days. It is around half that now. Coronavirus is going to be a major challenge until we have a vaccine. So the defining question as we head into a potentially difficult winter is how to balance keeping the virus in check with getting on with our lives. The REACT study,externalof more than 150,000 volunteers in England, one of the three new sources of data on community levels, found ""accelerating transmission"" at the end of August and start of September. It said levels of infection were rising across England but particularly in the north east, north west and Yorkshire. Merseyside 'becomes an area of concern' Tyneside and Wearside areas added to Covid list Lockdown restrictions extended to Lanarkshire And there were increases in positive cases in all age groups up to the age of 65, with highest rates of growth in 18-24 year olds. Prof Paul Elliott, director of the study at Imperial College London, said the data clearly showed ""a concerning trend in coronavirus infections"" where cases are growing quickly across England and ""no longer concentrated in key workers"". He said there was evidence of ""an epidemic in the community"" which was not the result of more people being tested.

Face masks in shops rule to be introduced in Wales,"This video can not be played First Minister Mark Drakeford says he is confident there will be ""good levels of compliance"" People in Wales must wear face masks in shops and other indoor public spaces from Monday as coronavirus cases rise. First Minister Mark Drakeford said the change was because 20 people in every 100,000 in Wales now had Covid-19, asthe UK infection R number rose to 1.2. Indoor meetings of more than six from an extended household will be illegal from Monday, with fines in place. It comes as,externalto avoid followingCaerphilly into a local lockdown. The Welsh Government said the face mask rule would not apply to children aged under 11. Where do I have to wear a face covering now? England and Wales' contact-tracing app to launch R number goes above 1 as coronavirus cases rise Mr Drakeford warned flouting face covering restrictions could face a fine of Â£1,920. He said curfews and the restriction of alcohol sales were among measures that could now be taken. The new restriction will apply in pubs and restaurants, as well as private homes, meaning groups of six must be part of the same extended household. He said most people had complied with social distancing rules but ""a small minority have not done so"". New powers would allow local authorities to close premises or stop events happening on public health grounds. ""These powers will enable local authorities to move quickly to respond to outbreaks of the virus in their areas, for example where a number of cases are linked to a particular premise or as a preventative measure, where there is a high risk of outbreak,"" Mr Drakeford said. Charlotte Harding lives in Ferndale in the Rhondda with husband Richard and sons Ethan, 8, and Harrison, 6 Charlotte Harding, a mother of two, has had to cancel her son's birthday meal because of Wales' new rules. ""We are due to go the Sunday after next to have a family meal for my son's birthday. That won't go ahead now,"" she said. ""With three families coming together, that's not going to be a possibility. The boys are going to be upset as we won't be able to see our niece, we won't be able to see their nans. ""I have a lot of friends whose households are made up of six people so it is going to be a struggle for lots of families. ""All those little anxieties I had before the lockdown are back. I am a bit worried about not being able to see my family, the children not being able to see their grandparents. That's going to be hard again"". The first minister said there was ""a short window to get ahead of the gathering storm"" of coronavirus. Mr Drakeford said that following the rules would help avoid ""more draconian measures"". Public Health Wales data shows there have been no deaths with coronavirus in Wales in September Mr Drakeford said the ""hotspot areas"" of Caerphilly county, Merthyr Tydfil and Rhondda Cynon Taff were being monitored closely to see if further action was needed to prevent the ongoing spread of coronavirus. The first minister said it was important people carried on working from home if they could. Mr Drakeford told the BBC the rate of 20 people in 100,000 was the ""threshold we use for people to have to quarantine coming back into the UK"". He said if that figure fell, the advice on face masks could be looked at again. The new mask rule would come in from Monday to give people time to buy one, he said. Masks were not ""some sort of magic wand"" but ""a sensible addition to the precautionary measures we are taking"" to avert a crisis. This video can not be played Stop your glasses steaming up with a mask on Mr Drakeford said masks would not be mandatory in workplaces and said wearing them in school did ""not seem proportionate."" Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said the announcement ""was very welcome"" though the evidence on them was ""never going to be 100%."" Conservative Member of the Senedd, Darren Millar, said on Twitter his party had been calling for mandatory masks in shops since early July: ""On Wednesday we tabled a debate in the Welsh Parliament. Today, the Welsh Labour-led Government finally act."" The Federation of Small Businesses said it hoped the new mask rules would ""provide reassurance"" to shoppers. But it joined the shop workers union USDAW in urging customers to continue treating staff with respect. ""The move to make wearing face coverings mandatory is further proof there will be no immediate return to normal shopping,"" said Sara Jones, head of the Welsh Retail Consortium. Those working in towns and city centres have broadly welcomed the move to avoid another full lockdown. ""Businesses just need to know what they have to do to be able to open up and trade,"" said Kevin Ward, manager of the Newport Now business improvement district. ""Certain regulations have changed through the pandemic but what nobody wants is to have to go into a full lockdown again. For a lot of independent businesses and [chain stores], they would not survive another lockdown,"" he said. Kevin Ward said retailers needed to know what to do in order to trade Neil Butler, of teachers' union NASUWT, said he was worried about schools: ""The Welsh Government is positively saying no, we do not want face coverings in those particular environments."" Ministers said the restrictions on people meeting followed an increase in cases linked to people socialising indoors. Up to four households have been able to form an extended household and meet since late August. Until now, there has been no legal limit on how many people could gather. Mr Drakeford said the rule of up to 30 people being allowed to meet outdoors would include peoples' gardens. Bubble trouble? What can you now do in lockdown? New rules 'no longer than we have to' - Hancock Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales Children aged under 11 are not included in the six. The new rules on meeting indoors will not apply in Caerphilly county borough, whichwas put under local lockdown on Tuesday, where all extended household meetings are currently banned inside. Shoppers wearing face masks in Caerphilly, the first place in Wales to have a local lockdown The move comes after other parts of the UK also restricted meetings to six - but did so both indoors and outdoors. The UK government is restricting gatherings in England to just six peoplefrom Monday, with some exceptions. The number of people that can meet in Scotlandhas also been cut to six. Wales' coronavirus rules mean people can only be part of a single extended household, which cannot be changed once arranged. Despite the gradual easing of restrictions over the summer, meetings indoors with anyone outside your extended household have remained illegal. The recent rise in cases seen in Caerphilly county was blamed on people socialising in other people's homes in large numbers. The area has seen one of the highest rates of cases in the whole of the UK, with 91.1 cases per 100,000 people over seven days. On Thursday, residents of Rhondda Cynon Taff and Merthyr Tydfil were asked to follow a range of measures to avoid a local lockdown.

Fake driving licences offered online for Â£600,"This video can not be played A scammer explains to Kafui Okpattah how the fake licence scheme works Scammers on social media who claim to work for the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency are selling ""full driving licences"" for Â£600, a BBC News investigation has found. They claim to have inside access to driving test centres which allows them to book and pass practical driving tests without clients being present. The Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency - which has responsibility for driving tests - said that was not possible. They are money-making scams, it said. It is illegal to drive without a valid licence. The punishment for doing so includes a fine of up to Â£1,000, up to six points on your licence and a possible disqualification. The licence vendors claim to supply their clients with a plastic licence card and test certificate at their home address. They also send clients an image of what appears to be their updated driving licence status as shown on the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency's (DVLA) ""view your licence"" webpage. The client's driving status reads ""full driving licence"", which suggests they are on the DVLA database as registered to drive - despite having paid for their licence instead of taking and passing a driving test. BBC News has discovered that these images are fraudulent mock-ups of the DVLA's ""view your licence"" webpage and that the licence numbers clients are issued with are not on the agency's database. The BBC sent the examples of the licences to the DVLA. In response, the DVLA said: ""Only DVLA can issue a driving licence. We can confirm that the examples seen are not genuine."" The licence vendors advertise their service on social media platforms such as Instagram, but urge any potential clients to message them privately on WhatsApp. BBC News has acquired screenshots of text messages between clients and the licence vendors. They show the vendor asking for personal details such as the client's address, date of birth and a passport photo - information the seller says is required to issue a licence. Text messages seen by the BBC also show the licence vendor discussing payments with his clients and them thanking him for his service. To find out more about how the scammers operate, BBC News sent text messages to a vendor posing as a potential client. The vendor is asked if the DVLA would find out but is assured they wouldn't because ""we [the vendors] work for DVLA"". In a phone call with the BBC, which was covertly recorded, the vendor went into more detail about how the fraud is carried out. ""We usually book your test for you and pass it without you actually being there but it's gonna look like you were there"" he said. ""If you do wanna go ahead, I'll need your full name and provisional licence number."" The vendor suggested he was able to cheat the driving test and pass people without them being present, allowing them to have their licence updated to a ""full driving licence"". He also told the BBC he could start the process that same day and everything would be done in ""five to seven days"". In a statement responding to the BBC's investigation, the DVLA said: ""We are aware of these offers and are investigating similar claims. ""We have so far found no evidence to suggest these claims are true or anything more than money-making scams."" Scarlett (not her real name) tried to acquire a driving licence from the vendor. She told the BBC she came across his account on Instagram and ""paid Â£500 for him to pass my driving test"". Scarlett says that despite having paid the vendor, all she received was an image of her licence details. ""I checked the [licence] details he sent me but it was all fake,"" she says. ""I never received no licence just that picture. ""If you've found him, can you get my money back? I want my money back."" BBC News has learnt of several others, like Scarlett, who've tried to acquire a driving licence from a licence vendor. They come from different parts of the country, including Liverpool, Birmingham, North Yorkshire, Bradford and London. In its statement to the BBC, the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency warned members of the public against attempting to acquire licences illegally. ""The driving test is there to make sure all drivers have the skills and knowledge to use the roads safely and responsibly; trying to circumvent it is illegal and a serious danger to road users,"" it said.

During his briefing, First Minister Mark Drakeford confirmed new rules would be in force from Monday.  No new deaths of people with coronavirus have been recorded in the last 24 hours - however there were a further 133 cases. Thirty of the new cases were in Caerphilly county borough, while there were 23 in Rhondda Cynon Taf and 10 more cases in Newport. We'll keep you updated on all the latest coronavirus developments on the BBC Wales News website and social media channels. Local Democracy Reporting Service Bridgend council is urging visitors to avoid Porthcawl from September 25 to 27 when the townâs annual Elvis Festival was due to take place. The event was cancelled last monthas coronavirus restrictions continue to be in force. It usually draws a crowd of 35,000 with 100 Elvis Presley impersonators performing at 30 venues across the resort. However, the council and South Wales Police fear people may still gather in Porthcawl in large crowds despite rising cases of covid-19 across south Wales. Council leader Huw David urged people to ""think twice, stay safe, and stay home"". âDespite the hard work and efforts of the last five months, we are starting to see an increase in positive cases of Covid-19 across south Wales, largely because not everyone is following the simple steps required to keep people safe,â he added. Return to sender: Elvis fans urged to stay away from Porthcawl as festival is cancelled There were 30 new cases of Covid-19 recorded in Caerphilly county borough by Public Health Wales. It means the rate of cases for the last week stands at 96.6 per 100,000 of the population, second highest in the UK behind Bolton, in Greater Manchester. There were a further 23 cases recorded in Rhondda Cynon Taf, while the number of new infections in Merthyr Tydfil fell to four. Public Health Wales says there have been 133 new Covid cases recorded in Wales since yesterday. However, there have been no new deaths with coronavirus. The total number of people with Covid-19 in Wales now stands at 19,064. Mark SavageMusic reporter, BBC News Two weeks ago, in a walled garden in Hertfordshire, Sir Tom Jones played a greatest hits set to an audience of crickets, butterflies and Trevor Nelson. ""I felt like I'd regressed 20 years and gone to my first concert,"" enthuses the DJ. ""He was incredible. Just celebrated his 80th birthday and his voice was still great, so I felt really, really privileged."" Under normal circumstances, Nelson wouldn't be treated to a private audience with a singing knight of the realm. But these are abnormal times - and there was a plan afoot. This Sunday should have been the 10th instalment of BBC Radio 2 Live In Hyde Park - a ""festival in a day"" that sees the nation's biggest radio station throw a huge party for 50,000 fans in central London. Instead, the station will broadcast a virtualLive at Home festivalon BBC Radio 2, BBC Sounds and BBC iPlayer, with TV highlights on BBC Two. Read more here. Wales' first minister says the new NHS Covid-19 contact tracing app could be a ""useful and useable device"". The app is due to be launched across England and Waleslater this month. Mark Drakeford said he was ""more confident than I would have been about the previous version"". He said  the Welsh Government had been ""more closely engaged"" in the development of the new   app. ""The advice I have from people in the Welsh Government who have been 
using it as part of the trial is that it is succeeding and doing the job
 that it is set up to do,"" the first minister said. ""Everything that I am told so far makes me more confident that this 
will be a useful and usable device in Wales and, provided it turns out to
 be that, it will certainly have our support."" The body representing trade unions in Wales says it wants to see compulsory face masks introduced in secondary schools. The Wales TUC said it welcomed the Welsh Government's decision to insist on face coverings in shops and indoor spaces from Monday. But its general secretary in Wales Shavanah Taj added: âThe Welsh 
Government should now also extend the mandatory use of face masks to 
secondary schools â in line with practice across the rest of the UK. She added: âThe local lockdown in Caerphilly and the sharp rise in 
case numbers in other local authority areas demonstrates the severity of
 the threat that Covid-19 continues to pose.""  Clarifying the rules for restaurants in Wales from Monday, First Minister Mark Drakeford said a booking could only be taken for six people at a time inside. He said those six people would have to be from the same extended household. ""It cannot be six strangers from six different households all meeting together in that way,"" he said. ""It's got to be within the single extended household and only six people can meet at any one time."" The limit of six people does not include children aged 11 and under, who are exempt from the new rule. BBC Cymru Wales will no long broadcast every Welsh Government coronavirus briefing on TV. From Monday the briefings will only be shown live on TV when significant announcements are made. A similar decision has been taken in Scotland, where almost 10,000 people have signed a petition opposing the plan. The BBC will continue to broadcast the Welsh Government briefings 
online, and says it will use editorial judgement to decide when to show 
them on TV too. In a statement a BBC Cymru Wales official said: ""Weâll 
continue to provide extensive coverage of the government press 
conferences across our news services, including live streaming online. âWeâll also carry press conferences live on BBC One Wales, when major developments or updates are anticipated."" The briefings currently take place at 12:30 BST every Tuesday, and every third Friday following the required three-weekly review of lockdown restrictions. Welsh-language channel S4C will continue to broadcast the Welsh governmentâs briefings on TV and on the Newyddion S4C Facebook page. Wales's first minister says a whole raft of measures are up for discussion when local lockdowns are implemented. Mark Drakeford said it included possible curfews, cutting opening hours of pubs and restaurants, and even restricting the amount of alcohol a person can buy at one time. ""Today we're putting, for example, the possibility that curfews may be necessary,"" he said. ""As part of some local lockdowns we're looking at the possibility 
that we would be able to close premises earlier in the evening."" A total of58 jobs are set to be cut at an office furniture firmin Rhondda Cynon Taf after sales fell during the coronavirus pandemic. Orangebox opened its headquarters and factory in Nantgarw in 2014. The firm, which employs about 250 people in south Wales, said it was offering voluntary redundancies in the hope of avoiding compulsory lay-offs. Managing Director Mino Vernaschi said they had to make difficult decisions to ensure the future of the business. The prospects for local lockdowns in areas like Rhondda Cynon Taf and Merthyr Tydfil are being reviewed  âon a daily basisâ, First Minister Mark Drakeford said today. Caerphilly county borough saw extra restrictions introduced on Tuesday, including a ban on non-essential travel into or out of the council area. Some 
localised measures have already been introduced in the other two local 
authority areas, together with pleas to residents to follow the rules. âI want to add my voice in urging people in those local authority 
areas to follow the advice they have been given, because if they do, 
there is a chance we will be able to avoid taking more stringent 
national measures to deal with the outbreak,â Mr Drakeford said. Officials will meet on Monday to discuss the latest testing and case data from Rhondda Cynon Taf and Merthyr Tydfil. Wales' first minister says he's ""reluctant"" to give a date for when the new restrictions could be lifted. Mark Drakeford said the situation will
 be reviewed and measures will be eased if they are ""no longer 
proportionate to the problem"". But he stressed: ""If it remains necessary it will remain in force and
 if that does take us to the rest of this year, and regrettably, that is
 what we will have to do."" Mr Drakeford added families should still be able to get together over Christmas under the measures announced today. ""As far as Christmas in Wales is concerned, it's important to just 
identify another difference between our position and that across our 
border, which is that the figure of six does not include young children 
in Wales children under the age of 11 are not included"", he said. ""So family gatherings where children, parents and sometimes 
grandparents will work together to get together for Christmas will still
 be allowed in Wales."" Explaining why he was limiting the number of people meeting indoors to six, First Minister Mark Drakeford said it was ""because of simplicity of messaging"". ""When you have a population, as we have in Wales, that is close to our border [with England] we'll be hearing all the time from news outlets across our border about the rule of six,"" he said. Answering journalists' questions, Mr Drakeford said ""having the same number here in Wales just allows us to have a simple and common message"". ""And we know that messaging is itself an important part of responding to a public health emergency,"" he added. The first Minister says councils in Wales will be given new powers to take action themselves to reduce the spread of coronavirus. Mark Drakeford said most people had complied with the rules but ""a small minority have not done so"". He
 said the new powers, which will come into force on Monday, will allow 
local authorities to close premises or stop events happening on public 
health grounds. ""These powers will enable local authorities to move 
quickly to respond to outbreaks of the virus in their areas, for example
 where a number of cases are linked to a particular premise or as a 
preventative measure, where there is a high risk of outbreak."" Wales' first minister says the past few weeks ""have been a set-back"" in the battle to control coronavirus,but he said ""it is not inevitable things will worsen further"". Mark Drakeford added: ""If we all work together, follow the rules and the new measures to 
protect ourselves and our loved ones, we can keep Wales safe."" With foreign holidays a precarious business this year, self-catering rentals across the country saw a boom; at least if you couldn't get abroad you could ""staycation"" with family. But some would-be holidaymakers are now being forced to cancel their plans. From Monday, new rules will limit the number of people that can holiday together to a maximum of six, not counting children under 11. Andit will deal ""a hammer blow"" to the sector, says Alistair Handyside, who represents holiday rental owners. Penalties for not following the new laws in Wales on face coverings and the ""rule of six"" people meeting have been confirmed by the first minister. ""People who knowingly and deliberately flout the law in Wales could face fines of up to Â£1,920 for repeat offences,"" Mark Drakeford said. First Minister Mark Drakeford confirmed new rules and restrictions will be introduced next week on indoor gatherings of friends and family. ""From Monday, a new limit of six people will be introduced on the number of people who can meet indoors at any one time,"" he said. ""All six must belong to the same exclusive extended household group. ""Extended household groups can still be made from up to four 
households joining together, but from Monday six people can meet at any 
one time. ""Children under 11 will not be included in our rule of six."" Mr Drakeford warned that indoor gatherings of more than six people ""will therefore be against the law in Wales"". Wales' first minister said it was important that people carry on working from home if they can. ""It has never been our policy to encourage people to return their 
workplace if they can continue to work from home or work remotely,"" Mark Drakeford told the Welsh Government's coronavirus briefing. He said the message from England had been ""go back to the office"". ""This is not - and never has been - our message,"" Mr Drakeford added. ""We want people to carry on working from home if they can. ""The fewer people we come into contact with, the lower the risk of the virus spreading."" Â© 2025 BBC.

Tory MPs criticise 'lack of scrutiny' of virus law,"Some Tory MPs have criticised England's latest coronavirus rules that legally ban gatherings of more than six people. Ex-minister Steve Baker said the action amounted to ""arbitrary powers without scrutiny"" and MP Desmond Swayne said it was ""outrageous"" not to have a Parliamentary debate. BBC Newsnight understands some MPs want the rules to be reviewed more often. The health secretary says the new rules in England will not be kept in place ""any longer than we have to"". It comes as coronavirus infections have increased in recent weeks in the UK,according to estimates from Office for National Statistics. The government's latest R number - which measures the virus' ability to spread - is between 1 and 1.2 which means the epidemic is growing. Andhouseholds in Birmingham will be banned from mixingunder measures announced on Friday. The city has the second highest rate of Covid-19 infection in England, behind Bolton. Meanwhile, a Covid-19 contact-tracing app will be launched across England and Wales on 24 September,the government has announced. What are the new rules? 'We've got four kids so can't see anyone else' Who are the Covid marshals and what will they do? What will happen if children catch coronavirus? From Monday, the law change in England will ban more than six people meeting anywhere socially indoors or outdoors - dubbed the ""rule of six"". It will not apply to schools, workplaces or Covid-secure weddings, funerals and organised team sports. The rule will be enforced through a Â£100 fine if people fail to comply, doubling on each offence up to a maximum of Â£3,200. The measures include the introduction of ""Covid-secure marshals"", to help ensure social distancing in town and city centres. Scotland and Wales will also cut the number of people to allowed to meet up to six from Monday, amid concern over a sustained rise in cases. But in Scotland children under the age of 12 will not count towards the total, and in Wales the rule will not apply to children under 11 and up to 30 can still meet outside. But BBC Newsnight's political editor Nick Watt said there was a ""sour mood"" on the Tory benches, adding: ""Tory MPs do accept the government does need to introduce some measures to control the virus, but they want to clip the government's wings and that means demanding a greater role for Parliament."" He said senior Conservative backbenchers are lobbying Commons Speaker Lindsay Hoyle - who accused the government this week of bypassing Parliament - to make sure that legislation is being reviewed every month, not every six months. Conservative MP Steve Baker described the new restrictions as ""madness"". ""When you look at the draconian nature of the imposition on the British people, the shifting and uncertain legal environment, the lack of scrutiny and what has changed about this disease, I think it's time now to say that this is not a fit legal environment for the British people,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""It's time to move to a voluntary system, unless the government can demonstrate otherwise and it is time for us to start living like a free people."" He said the decision to have Covid marshals ""will turn every space in Britain in the equivalent of going into airport security where we are badgered"". ""I'm not willing to live like this,"" he added. Another ex-minister Sir Desmond Swayne said it was ""outrageous"" the laws had ""been made without consultation in Parliament"" and without any debate. SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? SUPPORT BUBBLES:What are they and who can be in yours? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? TESTING:What tests are available? Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth told BBC Newsnight his party was ""obviously concerned about civil liberties as well"" and when the original piece of coronavirus legislation went through Parliament ""we did raise our concerns"". ""But we also are aware we are in the midst of the biggest public health crisis we've faced for over 100 years and we understand that decisive and upsetting, difficult action has to be taken,"" he said. Announcing the detail of the rule change in England on Wednesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said ""we must act"" to avoid another lockdown, amid a rise in virus cases. Mr Johnson said the rules had ""become quite complicated and confusing"" and the government was ""simplifying and strengthening"" them after feedback from police and the public. The new ""rule of six"" means: Social gatheringsof more than six peoplein England will not be allowed in lawfrom Monday 14 September The new ruleapplies to people in private homes, indoors and outdoors, and places such as pubs, restaurants, cafes and public outdoor spaces Itapplies to all ages The ruledoes not apply to schools and workplaces, to people living together or in the same support bubble, or to weddings, funerals and organised team sports Thefull list of exemptions,externalalso includesprotests and political activitiessubject to ""strict risk assessments"", jury service and providing emergency assistance Peoplewho ignore the policecould be fined Â£100 - doubling with each offence to a maximum of Â£3,200 The prime minister also said on Wednesday the intention to return fans to stadiums from 1 October will be reviewed and pilot test events in September will be restricted to 1,000 fans. But on Friday the Premier League wrote to the government to say its clubs will defer holding test events ""until a sufficient number of fans are allowed back to enable thorough trials to take place"".

UK signs first major post-Brexit trade deal,"State for International Trade Liz Truss speaking to Japan""s Minister for Foreign Affairs Toshimitsu Motegi at the Department for International Trade The UK has struck its first major post-Brexit trade pact after signing a deal with Japan that aims to boost trade between the countries by about Â£15bn. International Trade Secretary Liz Truss said it was a ""historic moment"". She said it would bring ""new wins"" for British businesses in manufacturing, food and drink, and tech industries. Critics said while the deal may be of symbolic importance it would boost UK GDP by only 0.07%, a fraction of the trade that could be lost with the EU. Friday's deal still needs approval by Japan's parliament, which the country's Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi forecast would be passed by January. How many trade deals has the UK done? Ms Truss said the UK-Japan Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement means 99% of exports to Japan will be tariff-free. ""The agreement we have negotiated - in record time and in challenging circumstances - goes far beyond the existing EU deal, as it secures new wins for British businesses in our great manufacturing, food and drink, and tech industries,"" she said. ""From our automotive workers in Wales to our shoemakers in the North of England, this deal will help build back better as we create new opportunities for people throughout the whole of the UK and help level up our country."" She added that, strategically, the deal was an important step towards joining the Trans-Pacific Partnership and placing Britain at the centre of a network of free trade agreements. Major Japanese investors in the UK such as Nissan and Hitachi would benefit from reduced tariffs on parts coming from Japan and streamlined regulatory procedures, the UK's trade department statement said. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said Brexit gives Britain the freedom to strike trade deals with other countries around the world. Business leaders welcomed the agreement, but stressed that securing a deal with the EU remained the most important goal. The director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, Adam Marshall, called the announcement a milestone, but added: ""Whilst this agreement is undoubtedly cause for celebration, securing a Free Trade Agreement with the EU remains critical to the future of businesses in the UK. ""We urge ministers to redouble their efforts to reach a comprehensive partnership with our largest trading partner at a crucial time in the negotiations."" The CBI also hailed the agreement, with director general Carolyn Fairbairn saying this ""breakthrough moment"" can be the first of many. ""It's a huge opportunity to secure new Japanese investment across a wider range of sectors and UK regions,"" she said. You can almost hear the sighs of relief echoing around Westminster and within the business community. After weeks of wrangling, the first deal of the Brexit era has been struck, which ensures that 99% of British goods can enter Japan without tariffs, or extra charges. But ultimately, this deal largely mirrors the agreement which already exists between the EU and Japan. And with trade with Japan accounting for just 2% of the UK's total, the expected boost to GDP of 0.07% over the long term  is a tiny fraction of what might be lost from leaving the EU. And there is good reason for Japan cooperating to ensure this deal was secured in record time. It stands to get the lions share, 80%, of the total estimated Â£15bn boost to trade for both countries. Even then, the talks haven't been as speedy or straightforward as initially hoped - which may not bode well for  negotiations elsewhere. About 99% of exports between the two nations will be tariff-free under the deal, with a particular focus on the food and drink, finance and tech sectors. Manufacturing parts coming from Japan will benefit from reduced tariffs, as will British pork, beef and salmon travelling in the opposite direction. Japan's Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi said: ""It was a very tough negotiation, but we reached the agreement in principle in about three months, at an unusually fast pace. ""While maintaining the high levels of access to the British market under the Japan-EU EPA, we improved our access to the British market on train cars and some auto parts.""

"Brexit trade talks will resume despite falloutThe UK rejects the EU's demand to scrap plans to override the withdrawal treaty, but talks will continue.UK Politics","Boris Johnson has urged Conservative MPs to back his plan to override part of the Brexit withdrawal agreement. In a Zoom call with around 250 of them, he said the party must not return to ""miserable squabbling"" over Europe. The EU has warned the UK it could face legal action if it does not ditch controversial elements of the Internal Market Bill by the end of the month. And a Tory MP has proposed an amendment to the bill, which would affect trade between Britain and Northern Ireland. Meanwhile, the European Parliament has threatened to scupper any UK-EU trade deal if the bill becomes UK law. Analysis: Despite bitter Brexit row can deal still be done? UK signs first major post-Brexit trade deal Brexit to dominate week ahead in Parliament UK at odds with EU over approval for food exports The two sides have less than five weeks to agree a deal before Mr Johnson's 15 October deadline - after which he says he is prepared to ""walk away"". Informal talks are due to resume on Monday, with the next official round of talks - the ninth since March - starting in Brussels on 28 September. TheInternal Market Bill,external, which will be formally debated in the House of Commons for the first time on Monday, addresses the Northern Ireland Protocol - the part of the Brexit withdrawal agreement designed to prevent a hard border returning to the island of Ireland. If it became law it would give UK ministers powers to modify or ""disapply"" rules relating to the movement of goods between Britain and Northern Ireland that will come into force from 1 January, if the UK and EU are unable to strike a trade deal. The EU says the planned changes must be scrappedor they risk jeopardising the UK-EU trade talks. But the government has rejected this demand, arguing the measures in the bill are needed to protect the integrity of the UK and the peace process in Northern Ireland. Lords' anger over 'hypocritical' Brexit bill Kuenssberg: Brexit deal stand-off threatens trade talks How many trade deals has the UK done? In his Zoom call with MPs on Friday, the prime minister did not take questions and a poor signal meant the video and audio connections were lost for several minutes. He called for ""overwhelming support"" for the bill, describing it as ""absolutely vital"" to ""prevent a foreign or international body from having the power to break up our country"". Mr Johnson added that he would not countenance ""the threat of a border down the Irish Sea"". But he said there was still a ""very good chance"" of the UK and EU striking a deal by mid-October similar to that previouslyagreed between the EU and Canada- which got rid of most, but not all, tariffs on goods. BBC chief political correspondent Vicki Young said Tory MPs were ""looking for a sign of compromise"" from Mr Johnson, as they ""simply can't believe the government is prepared to break international law"", but the prime minister ""dug his heels in"". In a column in the Daily Telegraph,external, Mr Johnson accused the EU of reinterpreting the Withdrawal Agreement to ""destroy the economic and territorial integrity of the UK"" and ""endanger peace and stability in Northern Ireland"". ""I have to say that we never seriously believed that the EU would be willing to use a treaty, negotiated in good faith, to blockade one part of the UK, to cut it off,"" he said. Conservative backbencher Sir Bob Neill, who chairs the Commons Justice Committee, said he was not reassured by the prime minister's Zoom call. He is tabling an amendment to the bill to try to force a separate parliamentary vote on any changes to the Withdrawal Agreement. ""I believe it is potentially a harmful act for this country, it would damage our reputation and I think it will make it harder to strike trade deals going forward,"" he said. At around the same time as the prime minister was speaking, the European Parliament announced it would ""under no circumstances ratify"" any trade deal reached between the UK and EU if the ""UK authorities breach or threaten to breach"" the withdrawal agreement. Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis has admitted parts of the bill, which would go against a treaty signed by the UK and EU, would ""break international law in a very specific and limited way"". There is unease over this within the Conservative Party, with former leaders Theresa May, Lord Howard and Sir John Major urging Mr Johnson to think again.

Belgium ex-king's love child seeks royal rights,"Delphine BoÃ«l wants the same rights as her half siblings, her lawyer says The love child of the former Belgian King Albert II is hoping a court will grant her the same rights and titles as her father's legitimate children. Artist Delphine BoÃ«l, 52, has taken her case to the appeals court in Brussels. King Albert finally admitted he was Ms BoÃ«l's father in January this year, having fought her paternity claim for more than a decade. Her mother, Baroness Sybille de Selys Longchamps, claims she had an 18-year affair with Albert before he was king. Rumours of an illegitimate child first emerged in 1999 in an unauthorised biography about Albert's wife Queen Paola, prompting a royal scandal and enduring media gossip in Belgium. Ms BoÃ«l first alleged on the record that King Albert was her biological father during a 2005 interview, but it was not until he abdicated in 2013 - when he lost his immunity to prosecution - that she opened court proceedings. DNA test forces Belgian ex-king to admit paternity Belgium's King Albert abdicates Her lawyer said on Thursday that she was seeking the same rights as Albert's three other children, Philippe, now King of Belgium, Prince Laurent and Princess Astrid. ""Delphine's position isn't that she wants or doesn't want to be princess,"" said Marc Uyttendaele. ""She doesn't want to be a cut-price child, she wants to have exactly the same privileges, titles and capacities as her brothers and her sister."" Reports suggest her children would also be eligible for a royal title if the court rules in her favour. Albert's lawyer says she can only be given the title ""princess"" by royal decree, not by a court. Princess Paola of Belgium (later Queen Paola) and Prince Albert of Belgium with their children in 1969 Baroness Longchamps says the affair with the then Prince Albert of LiÃ¨ge lasted between 1966 and 1984, and he was a presence during Ms BoÃ«l's childhood. Following his older brother's death in 1993 at 62, Albert unexpectedly came to the throne. He held the position until July 2013, when he announced his abdication - citing ill health - and was replaced by his son, Philippe. The 86-year-old had resisted court orders to undergo DNA testing until he was facing fines of â¬5,000 per day (Â£4,611; $5,918, at current exchange rates) for refusing to do so. In January, he announced he accepted Ms BoÃ«l as his fourth child after he ""learnt the results of the DNA tests"". Mr Uyttendaele said at the time the admission was a ""relief"" for Ms BoÃ«l. ""Her life has been a long nightmare because of this quest for identity,"" he told RTL television. Belgium has a constitutional monarchy in which the king plays a largely ceremonial role.

The writers for the live page today were: George Wright, Lauren Turner, Alice Cuddy and Alex Therrien. The page was edited by Vicky Baker and Holly Wallis. We're about to bring our live page to a pause for today, but before we do, here is a recap of the main stories from today: There are ""worrying signs"" of infections among the elderly, Public Health England's medical director Prof Yvonne Doyle has said. Her warning came as daily cases in the UK rose to the highest level since 17 May. A total of 3,539 new Covid-19 cases were recorded on Friday, the Department of Health said, up from 2,919 the previous day. Prof Doyle said: ""Although younger people continue to make up the greatest share of new cases, we're now starting to see worrying signs of infections occurring in the elderly, who are at far higher risk of getting seriously ill. ""This is a reminder of the ongoing risk as the virus spreads throughout the UK. ""People should continue to follow social distancing rules, wash their hands regularly and wear a face covering in enclosed spaces. ""You should not mix with others when unwell.""  New Covid-19 restrictions for parts of Northern Ireland, including Belfast and Ballymena,come into force on Monday. There are new social restrictions and guidance about travel and leisure. Here, BBC News NI answers some of the many readers' questions it has received about the changes, and what they mean for you. Mark SavageMusic reporter, BBC News Two weeks ago, in a walled garden in Hertfordshire, Sir Tom Jones played a greatest hits set to an audience of crickets and butterflies. This Sunday should have been the 10th instalment of BBC Radio 2 Live In Hyde Park - a ""festival in a day"" that sees the nation's biggest radio station throw a huge party for 50,000 fans in central London. This year's line-up was signed and sealed at the start of 2020, but it soon became apparent that coronavirus was going to play havoc with it. The search began for an alternative venue - one sufficiently secluded to stop crowds gathering, but big enough to accommodate the trucks needed to build a set and film the show. Once the location was identified, organisers went back to the artists. Some had to pull out, but the core line-up - including, of course, Sir Tom - remained intact. The pre-recorded show will be broadcast this weekend for Radio 2 Live At Home. Here's more on how they did it. Spain has recorded 4,708 new coronavirus cases in 24 hours, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in the country to 566,326. In total, it reported a record increase of 12,183 new cases in its figures on Friday, but a lag in reporting means that cases can take several days to appear on the central government's data. Spain is the first country in the European Union to reach half a million coronavirus cases. It has recorded 29,747 deaths. Like other countries, Spain has ramped up testing for the virus. A strict three-month national lockdown was lifted in the country at the end of June, but authorities have imposed fresh restrictions - such as making face masks mandatory in public - amid a rise in infections. Covid-secure marshals will be introduced in towns and city centres in England to help ensure social distancing rules are followed, Prime Minister Boris Johnson recently announced. Marshals have already been used in Leeds and Cornwall during the coronavirus pandemic. However, plans to roll them out more widely have been criticised, with Conservative MP Steve Baker saying it would ""turn every public space in Britain into the equivalent of going through airport security"". So what is a Covid-secure marshal and what powers will they have? Read more France has seen an increase in people being admitted to hospital with coronavirus in recent days French Prime Minister Jean Castex says coronavirus is ""circulating more and more"" in the country, but that officials want to avoid any new nationwide lockdown. In a televised statement, Mr Castex announced several changes to Covid-19 testing and confinement policies. These include fast-tracking testing for priority cases, recruiting extra testers, and asking patients who have tested positive for Covid-19 to confine themselves for seven days, instead of 14. Mr Castex said the situation in Marseille, Bordeaux and Guadeloupe was ""worrying"", and that local authorities would be given more powers to tackle specific outbreaks. He said it was particularly concerning that the number of hospital admissions for coronavirus has gone up for the first time in weeks. The French government is under pressure to curb the spread of the virus amid a surge in cases. On Thursday, the countryrecorded almost 10,000 new coronavirus casesin 24 hours, marking its highest single-day count since the start of the outbreak.  Leicester's Diwali celebrations - believed to be among the biggest outside of India - have been cancelled due to coronavirus restrictions. Thousands of people usually gather to watch traditional dance and music events in the city throughout October. However, while the lights along the Golden Mile will still be switched on, Leicester City Council said large gatherings have to be prevented. Christmas events are also cancelled but decorations will still go up. Read more People living in the Scottish region of Lanarkshire will not be able to meet other households indoors from midnight on Friday. Similar measures are already in place in Glasgow, East and West Dunbartonshire, Renfrewshire and East Renfrewshire. The extension to North and South Lanarkshire means the restrictions now cover more than 1.75 million people in the west of Scotland. Read more here Armenia's Prime Minister Nikol Pashinya said the situation with coronavirus is improving Armenia has lifted its state of emergency but says some of its coronavirus restrictions will remain in place until January. The government said it had decided to end the state of emergency, which was introduced in mid-March and extended several times, because coronavirus was spreading less quickly than before. But its land borders will remain closed, public gatherings of more than 60 people will be banned, and mask-wearing will continue to be mandatory in enclosed public spaces, AFP news agency reports. Armenia - which has a population of about three million people - has recorded 45,503 coronavirus cases and 909 deaths so far.  Sex workers protested against a ban in DÃ¼sseldorf Coronavirus has been an unpleasant
intrusion into peopleâs intimacy in all sorts of ways, not least sex. German sex workers have won a
reprieve â even if it is temporary â as brothels are reopening in several
states, including the most populous one, North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW). Courts have decided that brothels
can operate provided there are strict hygiene rules â like at hairdressers - and
prostitutes wear masks with their clients. The top court in NRW found one-on-one
sex to be no more risky in the pandemic than say aerobics in a gym or a party
with dozens of revellers. It is also argued that keeping
brothels closed risks exposing sex workers to more crime, as they struggle to
make ends meet, German media report. The crisis has already bankrupted
one of Europeâs biggest brothels â 10-storey Pascha in Cologne, where about 120
prostitutes worked, along with cooks and hairdressers. Brothels are back in business in five
northern states, including Hamburg, and Saxony-Anhalt state in the east. Schools across Bristol will take part in the study A research project to track coronavirus infections in schools and help head teachers prevent disruption is being piloted in Bristol. The study aims to understand exactly how pupils transmit the virus, whether or not they are symptomatic. The University of Bristol study will saliva-test 4,000 pupils and 1,000 staff from schools across the city once a month for six months. It should provide vital information on how schools should deal with outbreaks. Read more Earlier, we reported that the coronavirus infection rate has been growing in the UK in recent weeks, according to new estimates. The reproduction number in the UK is now thought to be between 1 and 1.2. The R number is a way of rating coronavirus or any disease's ability to spread in the population. A number above 1 means the epidemic is growing, while below 1 it declines. Read more about how it is calculated and the different R numbers across UK areas here. A further 3,539 people have tested positive for coronavirus in the UK, figures released by the Department of Health and Social Care show. It is the sixth day in a row where daily cases have exceeded 2,000. It takes the total number of UK cases to 361,677. A further six deaths have been recorded in those who had a positive coronavirus test in the last 28 days. This takes the death toll by this criteria to 41,608. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Golden Week is one of China's biggest periods of migration Six
months since the World Health Organization declared Covid-19 a global pandemic,
China seems full of confidence that
itâs seen the back of the virus. It
has been 26 days since any domestic cases of Covid-19 were confirmed in the
country, and the government says that people donât need to take any extra
precautions ahead of one of the countryâs biggest annual migrations next month:
Golden Week. This is an annual week-long holiday that begins on 1 October. This
is the first time Chinese people have been told they can travel safely anywhere
in the country. But there is still apprehension, given cases became widespread
after Chinese New Year in January - the only other extended period of mass
migration. When the pandemic was announced in March, China - where the outbreak started - was already over its worst. Since then, many Chinese people have
been confident that a second wave can be avoided. In
the last six months, there have been around 4,300 confirmed cases of Covid-19
within the country's 1.4 billion population. These
were in major cities, including Beijing, the city of Dalian in northeastern
Liaoning, and Urumqi in northwestern Xinjiang. Local governments introduced
swift lockdowns as soon as a single case was detected, and citywide testing for
symptomatic and asymptomatic carriers appears to have helped bring these outbreaks under
control. The US is marking the anniversary of the 9/11 attacks amid coronavirus restrictions. Like others in attendance, Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, Vice President Mike Pence and New York Governor Andrew Cuomo all wore masks as they gathered at the site of the destroyed World Trade Center for a memorial ceremony. Mr Biden and Mr Pence bumped elbows in greeting. A number of 9/11 memorial events across the US were cancelled or modified this year because of the pandemic. At the New York event, a longstanding tradition of relatives reading the names of the dead was changed to a recording being played over speakers because of coronavirus safety precautions. But a separate 9/11 group organised an event nearby, where they said people would be allowed to recite the names while keeping a safe distance. Nearly 3,000 people were killed in the attacks on 11 September 2001. Two hijacked planes slammed into the Twin Towers, a third hit the Pentagon and a fourth was taken down in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, when its passengers rose up against the hijackers. US President Donald Trump led tributes at an event in Shanksville. As we've reported,a number of Conservative backbenchers have been criticising the government's new coronavirus restrictions. Former minister Sir Christopher Chope is the latest to voice his concerns, telling the Commons earlier that MPs should have been able to debate the introduction of the ""draconian"" new measures. A new so-called ""rule of six"" is being introduced on Monday, limiting the number of people who can socialise together indoors or outdoors in England to six people. However, the statutory instrument needed to enact the rule change has yet to be laid before Parliament. Sir Christopher said he was ""very concerned about the lack of opportunity for people, the public first of all, to see the text of these new regulations, and I'm also concerned about the continuing reluctance of the government to give any opportunities to members to debate this"". He added: ""What we are talking about is the most draconian introduction of new restrictions on our liberty, with criminal sanctions, and we need to be made aware of what's happening and given the opportunity of debating it."" Responding, Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle said ""the country should also know what's going on"". The game was held at Burnside Working Men's Club More than 60 people have tested positive for coronavirus following a charity football match, health officials have said. A further 33 people have now contracted the virus amid an outbreak linked to the event at Burnside Working Men's Club in Fencehouses, on the border of Sunderland and County Durham. About 300 people who attended the game, on 30 August, are having to self-isolate for 14 days. Read more Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford has warned that coronavirus is ""on the rise again in Wales"". The new case rate is now 20 per 100,000 people - the rate at which quarantine measures can be introduced for those returning to the country from abroad. Mr Drakeford said it ""indicates there is a serious risk of the virus spreading more widely once again"". He added there was a ""short window to get ahead of the gathering storm"" and avoid ""more draconian measures"" - especially with schools, colleges and universities returning. He urged people to work from home wherever possible. Regarding the messaging in England, to encourage people back to the office, he added: ""This is not and never has been our policy in Wales."" Meeting people indoors has been at the heart of the rise in cases, he said, confirming it will be illegal from Monday to meet more than six people from an extended household indoors. People who flout the laws in Wales will face fines if they don't wear masks indoors from Monday as well, he said. Read more here. Â© 2025 BBC.

Mining firm's boss to quit over Aboriginal cave blastsJean-SÃ©bastien Jacques and other senior executives will step down after the miner blew up sacred sites.Australia,"Jean-SÃ©bastien Jacques has been Rio Tinto's chief executive since 2016 The boss of Rio Tinto, Jean-SÃ©bastien Jacques, will step down following criticism of the mining giant's destruction of sacred Aboriginal sites. In May, the world's biggest iron ore miner destroyed two ancient caves in Pilbara, Western Australia. The company went ahead with blowing up the Juukan Gorge rock shelters despite the opposition of Aboriginal traditional owners. It sparked widespread condemnation from shareholders and the public. Church of England attacks miner for Aboriginal blasts Rio bosses lose bonuses over indigenous site destruction On Friday, the company said in a statement: ""Significant stakeholders have expressed concerns about executive accountability for the failings identified."" The board said Mr Jacques would remain as the chief executive until March or until a successor was appointed. Other senior executives, including the heads of the miner's iron ore and corporate relations divisions, will also leave the company at the end of the year. The caves - seen as one of Australia's most significant archaeological research sites - had shown evidence of continuous human habitation dating back 46,000 years. They sat above about eight million tonnes of high-grade iron ore, with an estimated value of Â£75m (A$132m; $96m). Juukan Gorge cave sites, seen before and after the destruction Australia's parliament is currently holding an inquiry into the miner's actions. Rio Tinto also held its own inquiry earlier this year, after which the company cut bonuses for directors and began attempts at repairing relations with Aboriginal communities. ""What happened at Juukan was wrong and we are determined to ensure that the destruction of a heritage site of such exceptional archaeological and cultural significance never occurs again at a Rio Tinto operation,"" said chairman Simon Thompson. Artefacts found at the caves include a 28,000-year-old animal bone tool and a 4,000-year-old belt made of plaited human hair. DNA testing had directly linked it to the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura (PKKP) people - the traditional owners of the land. After the caves were destroyed, a PKKP representative, John Ashburton, said losing the site was a ""devastating blow"". ""There are less than a handful of known Aboriginal sites in Australia that are as old as this one... Its importance cannot be underestimated,"" he said. Last week it was revealed that in the days running up to the caves' destruction in May, Rio Tinto hired lawyers in case opponents tried to seek injunctions to stop them. Although the company said it had permission for the work under Aboriginal heritage laws, critics said it suggested the miner was aware of the site's cultural importance. In June,rival miner BHP also halted its plans to expand its minein the Pilbara region in June following the outcry over Rio's actions. Last month, Rio Tinto said it had cut Mr Jacques' bonus by Â£2.7m. It also said Chris Salisbury, chief executive of iron ore, and Simone Niven, group executive of corporate relations, would lose more than half a million pounds each. But Tom Stevenson, investment director at Fidelity International, said Rio Tinto's actions had been ""slow and misguided"". ""It was slow because when it knew the significance of those sites it could have reversed its position and it didn't,"" he said. ""And it is misguided because when it cut bonuses recently it effectively put a price on something which is basically priceless and I think that that was tin-eared really. I'm not surprised that we've moved onto this stage where the chief executive felt that he had to go."" The cultural value of the Juukan Gorge shelters is huge and so is the loss. This decision to let the CEO go could be seen as a vindication after months of ongoing pressure from traditional landowners, other Aboriginal groups and shareholders who refused to stand for the destruction of one of Australia's most important archaeological sites. The scandal also highlights the great imbalance of power between Australia's influential mining industry and traditional landowners; and what the government's responsibility should be to ensure the protection of historical and ancestral sites. Last month Mr Jacques and two senior executives were stripped of their multimillion-dollar bonuses for 2020. The move seemed to have backfired. Many saw cutting the pay of already very high-earning executives as showing a clear lack of touch, and nowhere near a satisfactory retribution for those responsible for overseeing community relations. Rio Tinto chairman Simon Thompson said that the mining giant was determined to regain the trust of the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura people and other traditional owners. But given how they've handled this scandal, it's hard to see that happening any time soon.

Coronavirus poses 'existential threat' to choirs,"This video can not be played ""Existence is a challenge"" Some male voice choirs fear they will never sing again due to the coronavirus pandemic. The body representing more than 90 Welsh choirs said social distancing rules and fears about members' safety posed an ""existential threat"". Beaufort Male Choir has begun rehearsing outdoors in a rugby club stand to ensure their safety. But the choir's secretary said restrictions needed to be relaxed to allow safe rehearsals indoors. Male voice choirs have long been symbolic of Wales' cultural heritage and epitomise its reputation as a land of song. Singing church members 'miss companionship' Choir keeps 'spirit alive' rehearsing online Brass band survival fears as lockdown eased Since lockdown was announced in March, all choirs have had their rehearsals and concerts cancelled. It has led to a loss of income for some, but all have missed the social activity that came with weekly rehearsals and tours. Chris Evans had a ""tear in his eye"" when he heard the choir sing for the first time since lockdown Chris Evans is secretary of the Beaufort Male Choir in Ebbw Vale and is also secretary of the Welsh Association of Male Choirs (WAMC). He said: ""It's an existential issue for some. One, the demographics in choirs and in male choirs are quite old. So it means that there will be choristers who don't want to sing again. ""And if you're only a small choir and 50% of you decide they don't want to do it again, that means that existence is a challenge."" He added some choirs were struggling for venues in which to practise, and choirs had lost money over the summer. Beaufort Male Choir rehearsed last week for the first time since March in the stand at Ebbw Vale RFC, so the men could socially distance. Beaufort Male Choir, pictured with Tom Jones for the One Show in 2015, have had to rehearse separately during lockdown During lockdown the choir had been unable to rehearse, but members had been practising at home with recorded instructional videos from its musical director. Mr Evans said rehearsals at the rugby ground had been an emotional reunion: The first song that they sang last week was [the Welsh hymn] Gwahoddiad. ""I wasn't singing because I was running the mask store, but it brought tears to the eyes... it was brilliant to sing again."" The choir, pictured before the pandemic, hopes to return to performances next year The Welsh Association of Male Choirs surveyed its members about the pandemic and its report said: Almost all activity ceased in March, while two major concerts of massed choirs in London and Cardiff were postponed More than 450 individual concerts have been cancelled, half of which were fundraisers for charities 43 choir tours throughout the UK and Europe were cancelled An estimated loss of almost Â£140,000 across more than 90 choirs - the biggest single loss affecting one choir was Â£15,000 Beaufort's long choral history dates back to 1869 - this undated photo is one of those found by Chris Evans in the archives President of Beaufort Male Choir, Labour's Member of the Senedd for Blaenau Gwent Alun Davies, wants better guidance on rehearsals that would enable safe indoor practice sessions over the winter. ""There is nobody here who wants to break rules, and there is nobody here who wants to see people become ill as a consequence of what I am suggesting. ""But what we are looking at is having an element of normality that will be especially important as we face a winter, and those long dark cold months."" Despite concerns for the future, the WMAC said 50% of the choirs it surveyed had begun booking concerts for 2021. In the meantime, it said efforts were ongoing to keep in touch with members and encourage virtual rehearsals.

Brexit trade talks will resume despite fallout,"Boris Johnson has urged Conservative MPs to back his plan to override part of the Brexit withdrawal agreement. In a Zoom call with around 250 of them, he said the party must not return to ""miserable squabbling"" over Europe. The EU has warned the UK it could face legal action if it does not ditch controversial elements of the Internal Market Bill by the end of the month. And a Tory MP has proposed an amendment to the bill, which would affect trade between Britain and Northern Ireland. Meanwhile, the European Parliament has threatened to scupper any UK-EU trade deal if the bill becomes UK law. Analysis: Despite bitter Brexit row can deal still be done? UK signs first major post-Brexit trade deal Brexit to dominate week ahead in Parliament UK at odds with EU over approval for food exports The two sides have less than five weeks to agree a deal before Mr Johnson's 15 October deadline - after which he says he is prepared to ""walk away"". Informal talks are due to resume on Monday, with the next official round of talks - the ninth since March - starting in Brussels on 28 September. TheInternal Market Bill,external, which will be formally debated in the House of Commons for the first time on Monday, addresses the Northern Ireland Protocol - the part of the Brexit withdrawal agreement designed to prevent a hard border returning to the island of Ireland. If it became law it would give UK ministers powers to modify or ""disapply"" rules relating to the movement of goods between Britain and Northern Ireland that will come into force from 1 January, if the UK and EU are unable to strike a trade deal. The EU says the planned changes must be scrappedor they risk jeopardising the UK-EU trade talks. But the government has rejected this demand, arguing the measures in the bill are needed to protect the integrity of the UK and the peace process in Northern Ireland. Lords' anger over 'hypocritical' Brexit bill Kuenssberg: Brexit deal stand-off threatens trade talks How many trade deals has the UK done? In his Zoom call with MPs on Friday, the prime minister did not take questions and a poor signal meant the video and audio connections were lost for several minutes. He called for ""overwhelming support"" for the bill, describing it as ""absolutely vital"" to ""prevent a foreign or international body from having the power to break up our country"". Mr Johnson added that he would not countenance ""the threat of a border down the Irish Sea"". But he said there was still a ""very good chance"" of the UK and EU striking a deal by mid-October similar to that previouslyagreed between the EU and Canada- which got rid of most, but not all, tariffs on goods. BBC chief political correspondent Vicki Young said Tory MPs were ""looking for a sign of compromise"" from Mr Johnson, as they ""simply can't believe the government is prepared to break international law"", but the prime minister ""dug his heels in"". In a column in the Daily Telegraph,external, Mr Johnson accused the EU of reinterpreting the Withdrawal Agreement to ""destroy the economic and territorial integrity of the UK"" and ""endanger peace and stability in Northern Ireland"". ""I have to say that we never seriously believed that the EU would be willing to use a treaty, negotiated in good faith, to blockade one part of the UK, to cut it off,"" he said. Conservative backbencher Sir Bob Neill, who chairs the Commons Justice Committee, said he was not reassured by the prime minister's Zoom call. He is tabling an amendment to the bill to try to force a separate parliamentary vote on any changes to the Withdrawal Agreement. ""I believe it is potentially a harmful act for this country, it would damage our reputation and I think it will make it harder to strike trade deals going forward,"" he said. At around the same time as the prime minister was speaking, the European Parliament announced it would ""under no circumstances ratify"" any trade deal reached between the UK and EU if the ""UK authorities breach or threaten to breach"" the withdrawal agreement. Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis has admitted parts of the bill, which would go against a treaty signed by the UK and EU, would ""break international law in a very specific and limited way"". There is unease over this within the Conservative Party, with former leaders Theresa May, Lord Howard and Sir John Major urging Mr Johnson to think again.

Analysis: Can a deal still be done?,"EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier is in London this week for Brexit talks When it comes to Brexit, all negotiations are inter-linked: EU-UK trade talks, the process to implement their divorce deal, negotiations on fishing rights and Brussels' deliberation on UK financial service. What happens in one area very much affects progress in the others. You cannot separate them entirely. Which is why this week, as the war of words and wills between Brussels and Downing Street raged over the government's threat to throw a grenade at key parts of the divorce deal, everyone's thoughts turned immediately to the trade talks between the two sides. Could they survive? In fact, they limp on. Negotiations are set to resume in Brussels on Monday. This, despite the EU ending the week by threatening Downing Street with legal action unless it rowed back on its threats to the Withdrawal Agreement by the end of the month. Latest story: Brexit trade talks set to resume despite fallout The government insists it will not budge. So it is significant that the EU stopped short of threatening to press the nuclear button - shutting down trade talks altogether. Why is that, when we know the EU is furious? First of all, Brussels still wants a deal with the UK, if at all possible, this autumn. Secondly, the sense in Brussels is that the government is trying to provoke the EU into abandoning the trade negotiations. ""We're not going to give them that satisfaction,"" a high-level EU diplomat told me. ""We refuse to be manipulated."" This video can not be played UK vs EU: Johnson and Michel Barnier set out competing visions on trade So, despite bitter arguments over legislation on the one hand, and a huge list of outstanding issues still to be ironed out in bilateral trade talks; despite time and trust running out on both sides; neither the EU nor the UK seem to want to be the first ones to walk out the door. It is still possible, of course, that the government's bill is stopped in the House of Lords or even beforehand by rebel MPs. Deal stand-off threatens trade talks What are the sticking points in trade talks? What do I need to know about Brexit now? A simple guide It is possible for the EU and UK to iron out their differences over the divorce deal and in trade talks. Concessions can always be ""dressed-up"" to look like victories, after all. It has been done before. Remember last autumn? Finding agreement on the divorce deal seemed nigh on impossible - until it was not and a deal was signed. But, right now that feels like a long shot. The chatter on both sides of the Channel is that ""no deal"" is becoming more likely by the day.

What are planned deal changes?,"The government has said it is willing to drop parts of a controversial piece of legislation - the Internal Market Bill - which had the potential to further complicate the already tense trade talks between the UK and the EU. It contains measures relating to the way trade will be done between Northern Ireland and Great Britain in the future. They would only come into force if the UK and the EU failed to reach a trade deal. But they would overrule parts of the Brexit withdrawal agreement the UK signed with the EU last year. The House of Lordsvoted to remove the offending clausesfrom the bill in November but the House of Commons then voted to reinstate them. The government now says it is willing to withdraw them because of an ""agreement in principle"" on a range of issues affecting Northern Ireland. So, what is the controversy about? The withdrawal agreement (also known as the Brexit ""divorce deal"") includes a section - or protocol - on Northern Ireland, and it is now an international treaty. Article 4 of the agreement says the provisions of the treaty take legal precedence over anything in the UK's domestic law. So if any of the proposals in theInternal Market Bill,externalthat contradict the withdrawal agreement actually became law, it would breach the government's international obligations. That is what the Northern Ireland Secretary, Brandon Lewis referred to in September when he spoke about breaking international law in a ""very specific and limited way"". Breaking the law, though, is still breaking the law. The overall aim of the Northern Ireland protocol was to avoid the return of a ""hard"" land border between Northern Ireland, in the UK, and the Republic of Ireland, in the EU. All sides agreed they did not want the return of border checks - or other physical infrastructure - that could become a target. What is the Northern Ireland protocol? One of the solutions in the treaty was to keep Northern Ireland in the EU single market for goods, unlike the rest of the United Kingdom. People protesting between Newry and Dundalk about a possible hard border, in March 2019 It promised to maintain unfettered access for Northern Ireland goods to the rest of the UK but also introduced new bureaucracy for trade across the Irish Sea. The way these measures will be implemented on the ground have been negotiated by UK and EU officials, who have been meeting in a joint committee for the past few months. If there was no agreement by the end of the transition period, on 31 December 2020, and there was no free-trade deal, that is when parts of this new proposed legislation would have come into play. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. For example, the protocol states that companies moving goods from Northern Ireland to Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) would have to fill out export declaration forms. But the government's Internal Market Bill would give ministers the right to overrule or ignore this part of EU customs law. Another part of the protocol says the UK has to follow EU rules on state aid - the financial support governments give to businesses - for goods related to Northern Ireland. But the Internal Market Bill would give ministers power to interpret what that means and says this should not be done in accordance with the case law of the European Court of Justice. The EU said this was trying to change parts of a recently-agreed international treaty unilaterally. And when the legislation was first published, US President-elect Joe Biden warned that the Good Friday peace agreement in Northern Ireland ""cannot become a casualty of Brexit"". But on 8 December, the UK and EU announced an""an agreement in principle"",externalon issues including border control posts, the supply of food and medicines and clarification around state aid in Northern Ireland. As a result, the government said it would drop the controversial clauses in the bill. The Internal Market Bill only deals with trade from Northern Ireland to Great Britain, but the debate about goods moving in the opposite direction is equally sensitive. The protocol says the joint committee is supposed to determine which goods moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland are ""at risk"" of being exported over the Irish border to the EU and should therefore have tariffs - taxes on imports - imposed on them. If there was no agreement between the two sides, then the default position would be tariffs paid on all goods. The UK had plans, due to be introduced in a Taxation Bill, to allow UK ministers to make unilateral decisions on which goods could be deemed as ""at risk"" - after 1 January. But, as a result of the ""agreement in principle"" - the government says these measures won't now be introduced. What claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

Why is the UK in recession?,"The UK is out of recession after the economy returned to growth in the first three months of the year, official figures show. Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said the economy was ""returning to full health"", but Labour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said this was no time for a ""victory lap"". The Office for National Statistics (ONS) publishes figures for the UK's Gross Domestic Product (GDP). This is the value of all the goods and services the UK produces. When GDP rises, a country's economy grows and average incomes rise as a result. But sometimes the economy shrinks, GDP falls, and that's a sign that the economy is doing badly, which could hit people's pockets. What is GDP and how does it affect me? The UK is in recession if GDP falls for two successive three-month periods - known as quarters. The economy shrank 0.1% between July and September last year and then by a further 0.3% between October and December. This meantthe economy went into recession at the end of 2023. But the latest figures from the ONS show the UK economy grew by 0.6% between January and March 2024, marking the end of the recession. Is Rishi Sunak keeping his five key promises? Theprevious UK recession was in 2020, at the height of the coronavirus pandemic. It only lasted for six months, although the 20.4% fall in GDP recorded between April and June 2020 was the largest on record. In 2008 a recession started as a result of the global financial crisis, and went on for five quarters, or 15 months. Economic growth can mean more jobs are available and companies can pay more to employees and shareholders. Higher wages and larger profits also generate money for the government through taxes. It can chooseto spend more on things like benefits and public services, or cut tax rates. When the economy shrinks and a country goes into recession, these things can go into reverse. Some people might lose their jobs, and unemployment could rise. Others may find it harder to be promoted, or to get big enough pay rises to keep pace with price increases. However, the pain of a recession is typically not felt equally across society, and inequality can increase. Benefit recipients and those on fixed incomes are particularly likely to struggle, especially if the government decides to spend less on public services. In a recession,the Bank of England - which is independent of government - typically cuts interest rates. This makes it cheaper for businesses and households to borrow money which can boost spending and economic growth. However,prices have been rising very quickly in the UK, and the Bank put interest rates up to tackle that inflation. After 14 rate increases,the Bank hasheld interest rates at 5.25% six times in a row. When the economy is struggling to grow at the same time as there is high inflation, there can be a situation called ""stagflation"". This can be very difficult to solve, because the two issues require different solutions. However in May 2024, Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey told the BBC thatthe UK economy had ""turned a corner"". With growth of 0.6% from January to March this year, the UK was the joint fastest growing economy inthe G7 group of industrialised nations. But until then, the UK had been one of the weaker members of the G7. The US economygrew by 3.3% in the fourth quarter of 2023, which was much better than expected. That put the US at 2.5% over 2023 as a whole, the best performance of all other advanced economies. It is also expected to outperform the rest of the G7 in 2024. In October 2023,the International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicted that the UK would grow by just 0.6% in 2024. The independentOffice for Budget Responsibility (OBR)expects the UK economy to grow by 0.7% in 2024, but that is less than half of its earlier prediction of 1.8% growth. How will the UK economy compare to others in 2024? 'Like an atomic bomb': Los Angeles fire chiefs warn death toll is likely to rise What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

Stand-off threatens trade talks,"A bust-up with Brussels was always a possible feature of this autumn. But when EU top brass and their officials arrived in London this morning, it was not inevitable that it would come today. There were whispers yesterday that one or other of the sides might flounce out - but ""wait and see"" seemed the order of the day. Late last night, chatter from sources in Brussels suggested they were unwilling to rise to what they see as the UK's provocation, to ""take the bait"", as it was expressed to me. EU ultimatum to UK over Brexit talks Lords' anger over 'hypocritical' Brexit bill But after two sets of meetings today - one on the trade talks and the other on the government's plans to rewrite part of the agreed treaty from last year - there has been nothing less than a diplomatic explosion. The EU issued a statement that was about as furious as any I've ever seen in this kind of context - demanding that the UK government withdraw the controversial plans to override the deal done with the EU last year by the end of the month, and threatening to take legal action if it doesn't happen. Essentially saying that there's no chance of trade talks, and hence no chance of a deal, unless the UK backs down. At this stage however, anyone with more than a passing acquaintance with this government would know that's inconceivable. It is not, of course, impossible that further down the track the government may give way, or concede in quite a big way. But right now, the chances of a move are slim to none. The chances therefore of talks, that matter so much to our economy, moving very far are almost zilch - and therefore the chances of a deal are falling away. Remember last autumn, day-after-day-after-day the language between the two sides became more heated, brinkmanship more risky, the government's moves more audacious, and then, suddenly, a deal was done. And despite the EU's extraordinary statement, and serious stumbling blocks in the talks, the UK chief negotiator, Lord Frost, has now announced that the trade talks will still go ahead next week. The added complication here is that the government can't be sure at all that their plans to change the Northern Irish parts of the existing treaty will pass through Parliament. Resistance in the Lords is inevitable and while it's hard to gauge the final number, there is likely to be a rebellion from Tory MPs too. But Downing Street right now is confident that MPs will back the plans in the end. Willing to forgo a trade deal - if that's what their changes mean - rather than back down on their plans, having chosen to take what insiders admit is a nuclear option, for now, they are willing to stand back and watch the explosion.

Facemasks in shops rule to be introduced in Wales,"This video can not be played First Minister Mark Drakeford says he is confident there will be ""good levels of compliance"" People in Wales must wear face masks in shops and other indoor public spaces from Monday as coronavirus cases rise. First Minister Mark Drakeford said the change was because 20 people in every 100,000 in Wales now had Covid-19, asthe UK infection R number rose to 1.2. Indoor meetings of more than six from an extended household will be illegal from Monday, with fines in place. It comes as,externalto avoid followingCaerphilly into a local lockdown. The Welsh Government said the face mask rule would not apply to children aged under 11. Where do I have to wear a face covering now? England and Wales' contact-tracing app to launch R number goes above 1 as coronavirus cases rise Mr Drakeford warned flouting face covering restrictions could face a fine of Â£1,920. He said curfews and the restriction of alcohol sales were among measures that could now be taken. The new restriction will apply in pubs and restaurants, as well as private homes, meaning groups of six must be part of the same extended household. He said most people had complied with social distancing rules but ""a small minority have not done so"". New powers would allow local authorities to close premises or stop events happening on public health grounds. ""These powers will enable local authorities to move quickly to respond to outbreaks of the virus in their areas, for example where a number of cases are linked to a particular premise or as a preventative measure, where there is a high risk of outbreak,"" Mr Drakeford said. Charlotte Harding lives in Ferndale in the Rhondda with husband Richard and sons Ethan, 8, and Harrison, 6 Charlotte Harding, a mother of two, has had to cancel her son's birthday meal because of Wales' new rules. ""We are due to go the Sunday after next to have a family meal for my son's birthday. That won't go ahead now,"" she said. ""With three families coming together, that's not going to be a possibility. The boys are going to be upset as we won't be able to see our niece, we won't be able to see their nans. ""I have a lot of friends whose households are made up of six people so it is going to be a struggle for lots of families. ""All those little anxieties I had before the lockdown are back. I am a bit worried about not being able to see my family, the children not being able to see their grandparents. That's going to be hard again"". The first minister said there was ""a short window to get ahead of the gathering storm"" of coronavirus. Mr Drakeford said that following the rules would help avoid ""more draconian measures"". Public Health Wales data shows there have been no deaths with coronavirus in Wales in September Mr Drakeford said the ""hotspot areas"" of Caerphilly county, Merthyr Tydfil and Rhondda Cynon Taff were being monitored closely to see if further action was needed to prevent the ongoing spread of coronavirus. The first minister said it was important people carried on working from home if they could. Mr Drakeford told the BBC the rate of 20 people in 100,000 was the ""threshold we use for people to have to quarantine coming back into the UK"". He said if that figure fell, the advice on face masks could be looked at again. The new mask rule would come in from Monday to give people time to buy one, he said. Masks were not ""some sort of magic wand"" but ""a sensible addition to the precautionary measures we are taking"" to avert a crisis. This video can not be played Stop your glasses steaming up with a mask on Mr Drakeford said masks would not be mandatory in workplaces and said wearing them in school did ""not seem proportionate."" Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said the announcement ""was very welcome"" though the evidence on them was ""never going to be 100%."" Conservative Member of the Senedd, Darren Millar, said on Twitter his party had been calling for mandatory masks in shops since early July: ""On Wednesday we tabled a debate in the Welsh Parliament. Today, the Welsh Labour-led Government finally act."" The Federation of Small Businesses said it hoped the new mask rules would ""provide reassurance"" to shoppers. But it joined the shop workers union USDAW in urging customers to continue treating staff with respect. ""The move to make wearing face coverings mandatory is further proof there will be no immediate return to normal shopping,"" said Sara Jones, head of the Welsh Retail Consortium. Those working in towns and city centres have broadly welcomed the move to avoid another full lockdown. ""Businesses just need to know what they have to do to be able to open up and trade,"" said Kevin Ward, manager of the Newport Now business improvement district. ""Certain regulations have changed through the pandemic but what nobody wants is to have to go into a full lockdown again. For a lot of independent businesses and [chain stores], they would not survive another lockdown,"" he said. Kevin Ward said retailers needed to know what to do in order to trade Neil Butler, of teachers' union NASUWT, said he was worried about schools: ""The Welsh Government is positively saying no, we do not want face coverings in those particular environments."" Ministers said the restrictions on people meeting followed an increase in cases linked to people socialising indoors. Up to four households have been able to form an extended household and meet since late August. Until now, there has been no legal limit on how many people could gather. Mr Drakeford said the rule of up to 30 people being allowed to meet outdoors would include peoples' gardens. Bubble trouble? What can you now do in lockdown? New rules 'no longer than we have to' - Hancock Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales Children aged under 11 are not included in the six. The new rules on meeting indoors will not apply in Caerphilly county borough, whichwas put under local lockdown on Tuesday, where all extended household meetings are currently banned inside. Shoppers wearing face masks in Caerphilly, the first place in Wales to have a local lockdown The move comes after other parts of the UK also restricted meetings to six - but did so both indoors and outdoors. The UK government is restricting gatherings in England to just six peoplefrom Monday, with some exceptions. The number of people that can meet in Scotlandhas also been cut to six. Wales' coronavirus rules mean people can only be part of a single extended household, which cannot be changed once arranged. Despite the gradual easing of restrictions over the summer, meetings indoors with anyone outside your extended household have remained illegal. The recent rise in cases seen in Caerphilly county was blamed on people socialising in other people's homes in large numbers. The area has seen one of the highest rates of cases in the whole of the UK, with 91.1 cases per 100,000 people over seven days.

Mining firm's boss to quit over Aboriginal cave blasts,"Jean-SÃ©bastien Jacques has been Rio Tinto's chief executive since 2016 The boss of Rio Tinto, Jean-SÃ©bastien Jacques, will step down following criticism of the mining giant's destruction of sacred Aboriginal sites. In May, the world's biggest iron ore miner destroyed two ancient caves in Pilbara, Western Australia. The company went ahead with blowing up the Juukan Gorge rock shelters despite the opposition of Aboriginal traditional owners. It sparked widespread condemnation from shareholders and the public. Church of England attacks miner for Aboriginal blasts Rio bosses lose bonuses over indigenous site destruction On Friday, the company said in a statement: ""Significant stakeholders have expressed concerns about executive accountability for the failings identified."" The board said Mr Jacques would remain as the chief executive until March or until a successor was appointed. Other senior executives, including the heads of the miner's iron ore and corporate relations divisions, will also leave the company at the end of the year. The caves - seen as one of Australia's most significant archaeological research sites - had shown evidence of continuous human habitation dating back 46,000 years. They sat above about eight million tonnes of high-grade iron ore, with an estimated value of Â£75m (A$132m; $96m). Juukan Gorge cave sites, seen before and after the destruction Australia's parliament is currently holding an inquiry into the miner's actions. Rio Tinto also held its own inquiry earlier this year, after which the company cut bonuses for directors and began attempts at repairing relations with Aboriginal communities. ""What happened at Juukan was wrong and we are determined to ensure that the destruction of a heritage site of such exceptional archaeological and cultural significance never occurs again at a Rio Tinto operation,"" said chairman Simon Thompson. Artefacts found at the caves include a 28,000-year-old animal bone tool and a 4,000-year-old belt made of plaited human hair. DNA testing had directly linked it to the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura (PKKP) people - the traditional owners of the land. After the caves were destroyed, a PKKP representative, John Ashburton, said losing the site was a ""devastating blow"". ""There are less than a handful of known Aboriginal sites in Australia that are as old as this one... Its importance cannot be underestimated,"" he said. Last week it was revealed that in the days running up to the caves' destruction in May, Rio Tinto hired lawyers in case opponents tried to seek injunctions to stop them. Although the company said it had permission for the work under Aboriginal heritage laws, critics said it suggested the miner was aware of the site's cultural importance. In June,rival miner BHP also halted its plans to expand its minein the Pilbara region in June following the outcry over Rio's actions. Last month, Rio Tinto said it had cut Mr Jacques' bonus by Â£2.7m. It also said Chris Salisbury, chief executive of iron ore, and Simone Niven, group executive of corporate relations, would lose more than half a million pounds each. But Tom Stevenson, investment director at Fidelity International, said Rio Tinto's actions had been ""slow and misguided"". ""It was slow because when it knew the significance of those sites it could have reversed its position and it didn't,"" he said. ""And it is misguided because when it cut bonuses recently it effectively put a price on something which is basically priceless and I think that that was tin-eared really. I'm not surprised that we've moved onto this stage where the chief executive felt that he had to go."" The cultural value of the Juukan Gorge shelters is huge and so is the loss. This decision to let the CEO go could be seen as a vindication after months of ongoing pressure from traditional landowners, other Aboriginal groups and shareholders who refused to stand for the destruction of one of Australia's most important archaeological sites. The scandal also highlights the great imbalance of power between Australia's influential mining industry and traditional landowners; and what the government's responsibility should be to ensure the protection of historical and ancestral sites. Last month Mr Jacques and two senior executives were stripped of their multimillion-dollar bonuses for 2020. The move seemed to have backfired. Many saw cutting the pay of already very high-earning executives as showing a clear lack of touch, and nowhere near a satisfactory retribution for those responsible for overseeing community relations. Rio Tinto chairman Simon Thompson said that the mining giant was determined to regain the trust of the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura people and other traditional owners. But given how they've handled this scandal, it's hard to see that happening any time soon.

Google and Twitter vow to block voting misinformation,"Google and Twitter have said they are clamping down further on misinformation online ahead of the US elections. Messaging platforms expect a flood of false claims and misleading posts ahead of the November vote. Twitter said it plans to more aggressively label and remove election-related tweets that are inaccurate. Search engine Google said it would screen more auto-complete results to avoid voters being misled, particularly over reports claiming an early victory. Facebook and Twitter 'dismantle Russian network' China calls for inquiry after porn tweet 'like' One of the concerns is that the widespread use of mail ballots in the US election due to the coronavirus pandemic could cause significant delays in tallying results. Experts fear this could allow misinformation to gain traction. On Thursday, Google said that incorrect information about election results would not show up in searches. Twitter's changes could also affect tweets claiming victory before election results have been certified, along with misleading posts about ballot tampering. Social media firms have been under pressure to combat misinformation after US intelligence agencies determined Russia used their platforms to meddle in the 2016 presidential election. ""We will not permit our service to be abused around civic processes, most importantly elections,"" Twitter wrote in its blog. ""Any attempt to do so - both foreign and domestic - will be met with strict enforcement of our rules, which are applied equally and judiciously for everyone."" On Friday, Microsoft warned that hackers with ties to Russia, China and Iran wereattempting to snoop on people and groups involved with the US 2020 presidential election. The US tech firm said the Russian hackers who breached the 2016 Democratic campaign were again involved. Last week,Facebook said it had dismantled a small network of accounts and pagesthat were part of a Russian influence operation. The company said the campaign was linked to Russia's Internet Research Agency (IRA), an organisation close to the Russian government and accused of interference in the 2016 US election. Twitter also suspended five accounts from the same network. The operation centred around PeaceData, which claimed to be a non-profit news website in English and Arabic. The messaging platform has clashed in recent months with President Donald Trump, who has posted frequently about potential fraud in the coming election while criticising Twitter for flagging his posts. In Google's changes to auto-complete results, which predict what users are searching for, it will remove predictions ""that could be interpreted as claims for or against any candidate or political party"". It will also remove the function that attempts to predict and complete search terms when people look up the status of voting locations, voting requirements or methods. Users will still be able to search for this information however. Last week, Facebook said it was creating a label for posts by candidates or campaigns that made premature claims of victory. It also said it would stop accepting new political ads in the week before Election Day.

Greece to EU: Words alone will not help migrants,"This video can not be played The BBC's Jean Mackenzie reflects on her experiences at the camp Greece has urged European countries to ""move from words of solidarity"" to action as it struggles to find shelter for thousands of migrants left homeless after a fire destroyed their camp. Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis' comments were echoed by German Chancellor Angela Merkel who said the EU must share more responsibility. France, Germany and the Netherlands have offered to take in some migrants. About 13,000 people had been living in squalor in the Moria camp on Lesbos. For a third night families were sleeping on roads, in fields, car parks and even in a cemetery after fleeing the camp. The government said it would take days to find accommodation for them. Near the ruins of Moria - Greece's largest camp - local residents blocked roads to stop charities from delivering aid and said they were against the construction of new tents. How the migrant crisis changed Europe Med's deadly migrant crisis: In maps and charts Protecting yourself from coronavirus in a migrant camp Prime Minister Mitsotakis said the migrant crisis was Europe's problem, and concrete action was needed by the EU to tackle it. ""Europe must move from words of solidarity to a policy of acts of solidarity,"" he was quoted as saying by AFP news agency at a summit of Mediterranean leaders in Corsica. This video can not be played Migrants are struggling to cope out in the open Mrs Merkel said she had agreed ""as a preliminary step"" to a request by Mr Mitsotakis to take in some 400 unaccompanied minors who had been transferred from Lesbos to the Greek mainland. ""Germany and France will participate in this. I hope several other [EU] member states will do so too,"" she said. ""Migration is not just the problem of the countries where people arrive. Neither is it just Germany's problem. It must become more of a European responsibility."" The Netherlands agreed to take in 50 children. Touring the burnt-out Moria site on Thursday, European Commission's Vice-President Margaritis Schinas said it was ""inconceivable"" that the EU did not yet have a unified migration policy. He said the commission's proposals for a new pact on migration and asylum, due to be presented later this month, would ""put an end to this unacceptable situation"". How to deal with the mass arrivals of migrants, mainly to Italy and Greece, has divided the EU for years. Italy and Greece have accused wealthier northern countries of failing to do more, while a number of central and eastern nations are openly resistant to the idea of taking in a quota of migrants. Thousands of migrants have been left homeless after the fire Greece is sending three ships to Lesbos to provide accommodation for some 2,000 migrants. The Blue Star Chios ferry, which has capacity to house 1,000 people, has now docked at the Lesbos port of Sigri. Two naval vessels are also on their way. About 35 people who fled the fires on Tuesday and Wednesday night had tested positive for Covid-19. Eight of them are believed to have been located and isolated since the fires broke out. On a parking lot outside a supermarket on Thursday, hundreds of migrants, including families with small children, waited for bottled water and food to be distributed. ""There is no food, no milk for the baby,"" Congolese migrant Natzy Malala, who had a newborn infant and an eight-year-old girl, told Reuters news agency. Any attempt by the authorities to rebuild the Moira camp may be met by hostility from local residents. ""Now is the time to shut down Moria for good,"" Vangelis Violatzis, a local municipal leader, told AFP. ""We don't want another camp, and we will oppose any construction work. We've faced this situation for five years, it's time for others to bear this burden."" Child migrants sleep in pens at Lesbos port.

Rio Tinto boss to quit over Aboriginal cave blasts,"Jean-SÃ©bastien Jacques has been Rio Tinto's chief executive since 2016 The boss of Rio Tinto, Jean-SÃ©bastien Jacques, will step down following criticism of the mining giant's destruction of sacred Aboriginal sites. In May, the world's biggest iron ore miner destroyed two ancient caves in Pilbara, Western Australia. The company went ahead with blowing up the Juukan Gorge rock shelters despite the opposition of Aboriginal traditional owners. It sparked widespread condemnation from shareholders and the public. Church of England attacks miner for Aboriginal blasts Rio bosses lose bonuses over indigenous site destruction On Friday, the company said in a statement: ""Significant stakeholders have expressed concerns about executive accountability for the failings identified."" The board said Mr Jacques would remain as the chief executive until March or until a successor was appointed. Other senior executives, including the heads of the miner's iron ore and corporate relations divisions, will also leave the company at the end of the year. The caves - seen as one of Australia's most significant archaeological research sites - had shown evidence of continuous human habitation dating back 46,000 years. They sat above about eight million tonnes of high-grade iron ore, with an estimated value of Â£75m (A$132m; $96m). Juukan Gorge cave sites, seen before and after the destruction Australia's parliament is currently holding an inquiry into the miner's actions. Rio Tinto also held its own inquiry earlier this year, after which the company cut bonuses for directors and began attempts at repairing relations with Aboriginal communities. ""What happened at Juukan was wrong and we are determined to ensure that the destruction of a heritage site of such exceptional archaeological and cultural significance never occurs again at a Rio Tinto operation,"" said chairman Simon Thompson. Artefacts found at the caves include a 28,000-year-old animal bone tool and a 4,000-year-old belt made of plaited human hair. DNA testing had directly linked it to the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura (PKKP) people - the traditional owners of the land. After the caves were destroyed, a PKKP representative, John Ashburton, said losing the site was a ""devastating blow"". ""There are less than a handful of known Aboriginal sites in Australia that are as old as this one... Its importance cannot be underestimated,"" he said. Last week it was revealed that in the days running up to the caves' destruction in May, Rio Tinto hired lawyers in case opponents tried to seek injunctions to stop them. Although the company said it had permission for the work under Aboriginal heritage laws, critics said it suggested the miner was aware of the site's cultural importance. In June,rival miner BHP also halted its plans to expand its minein the Pilbara region in June following the outcry over Rio's actions. Last month, Rio Tinto said it had cut Mr Jacques' bonus by Â£2.7m. It also said Chris Salisbury, chief executive of iron ore, and Simone Niven, group executive of corporate relations, would lose more than half a million pounds each. But Tom Stevenson, investment director at Fidelity International, said Rio Tinto's actions had been ""slow and misguided"". ""It was slow because when it knew the significance of those sites it could have reversed its position and it didn't,"" he said. ""And it is misguided because when it cut bonuses recently it effectively put a price on something which is basically priceless and I think that that was tin-eared really. I'm not surprised that we've moved onto this stage where the chief executive felt that he had to go."" The cultural value of the Juukan Gorge shelters is huge and so is the loss. This decision to let the CEO go could be seen as a vindication after months of ongoing pressure from traditional landowners, other Aboriginal groups and shareholders who refused to stand for the destruction of one of Australia's most important archaeological sites. The scandal also highlights the great imbalance of power between Australia's influential mining industry and traditional landowners; and what the government's responsibility should be to ensure the protection of historical and ancestral sites. Last month Mr Jacques and two senior executives were stripped of their multimillion-dollar bonuses for 2020. The move seemed to have backfired. Many saw cutting the pay of already very high-earning executives as showing a clear lack of touch, and nowhere near a satisfactory retribution for those responsible for overseeing community relations. Rio Tinto chairman Simon Thompson said that the mining giant was determined to regain the trust of the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura people and other traditional owners. But given how they've handled this scandal, it's hard to see that happening any time soon.

"Over 500,000 flee 'unprecedented' Oregon wildfires","This video can not be played Drone footage shows homes completely wiped out by wildfires More than half a million people in the US state of Oregon are fleeing deadly wildfires that are raging across the Pacific Northwest, authorities say. Fanned by unusually hot, dry winds, dozens of fires are sweeping the state. At least one is being treated as suspected arson. Governor Kate Brown said the exact number of fatalities was not yet known, though at least four were confirmed. More than 100 wildfires are currently scorching 12 western US states. The worst affected are Oregon, California and Washington, where entire towns have been destroyed. In pictures: Oregon fires force thousands to flee Smoke from California wildfires turns skies orange False claims about Oregon fires spread online Some 4.4 million acres have been razed, according to the National Interagency Fire Center - an area larger than Connecticut and slightly smaller than Wales. On Thursday evening, the Oregon Office of Emergency Management confirmed the latest evacuation figures, which amount to more than 10% of the state's 4.2 million population. Gov Brown, a Democrat, said: ""We have never seen this amount of uncontained fire across the state... This will not be a one-time event. Unfortunately, it is the bellwether of the future. We're feeling the acute impacts of climate change."" While natural factors such as strong winds have helped the spread of these massive fires, the underlying heating of the climate from human activities is making these conflagrations bigger and more explosive. Nine of the world's 10 warmest years on record have occurred since 2005, and the UN warned this week that the five years from 2016 until this year will very likely be the hottest such period yet recorded. Both Oregon and California have warmed by more than 1C since 1900. The sustained warmth has seen six of the 20 largest fires on record in California all occur this year. In Oregon, the spate of fires has burned nearly twice the average annual losses in just the past week. In California, a prolonged drought over the past decade has killed millions of trees, turning them into potent fuel for the fires. Mountain regions that are normally cooler and wetter have dried out more rapidly in the summer, adding to the potential fuel load. Climate scientists had forecast that western wildfires would grow in size, scale and impact - but their predictions are coming to fruition faster than expected. A really simple guide to climate change The victims in Oregon include a 12-year-old boy and his grandmother, who died in a wildfire near Lyons, 70 miles (110km) south of Portland. Wyatt Tofte, his dog, and his grandmother Peggy Mosso died in the family car trying to escape the blaze. The child's mother was severely burnt. Lonnie Bertalotto, Ms Mosso's son and Wyatt's uncle, confirmed the deaths ina Facebook post,external. ""Don't take anything in life for granted and make the best of everyday,"" he wrote. Rich Tyler, a spokesman for the Oregon State Fire Marshal's office, told Reuters news agency: ""Every fire is investigated for the possibility of arson so that we can either determine it is or rule it out."" An infrared image shows destroyed homes in Phoenix, Oregon: burned vegetation and property appear grey, surviving vegetation is in red One of the most destructive blazes, the Almeda Fire, which started in Ashland near the California border, is being treated as suspicious. It has been linked to at least two deaths and destroyed hundreds of homes in the towns of Phoenix and Talent. The wildfires have also prompted mass evacuations in the suburbs of Portland, Oregon's largest city. Officials have set up 19 temporary shelters across the state for people fleeing the fires. Local news stationKOIN have published a list of the centres,external. More than 10% of Oregon's population are fleeing, according to the Oregon Office of Emergency Management Evacuation shelters have been asked to adopt ""policies to prevent the spread of Covid-19"", adding that authorities should try to set up dormitories of fewer than 50 people. Arelease said,externalanyone who spends time in a shelter should self-isolate once they leave as they may have been exposed to the virus. In Washington state, a one-year-old boy died and his parents were in a critical condition as they tried to escape the state's largest wildfire, in the northern county of Okanogan. A fire also destroyed most homes in the eastern town of Malden. This video can not be played Five ways that show the scale of California's 2020 wildfires In California, authorities in Butte County north of Sacramento have found 10 bodies in the last two days, and there are fears the toll will rise as 16 people remain unaccounted for. There, some 64,000 people were under evacuation orders while 14,000 firefighters battled 29 major fires. Sam Elm and her partner, Micah, lived in Phoenix, Oregon. Sam shared her experience fleeing from the wildfire - and saying goodbye to their home - with BBC OS. A fire started in a nearby town and began encroaching. ""It took our home,"" she says. ""It was an intense experience."" ""We were listening to the scanners... We were hearing it get closer and closer. ""At a certain point we got a call saying: 'You need to leave right now.' It was raining ash on - everything."" As they were about to leave, Sam says her wife called her upstairs to a wall in their home decorated with the signatures of friends, and members of their community - which Sam says was a ""point of pride"" for them. ""She slams her hand on the wall - because we've never signed our own wall, because it was our house we lived in - she traced her hand, she slammed my hand on the wall, she traced my hand, she kissed me and said: 'Don't forget this was our first home. And we left."" Sam Elm (left) and her wife Micah Elm had their first home burn down in a fire Sam adds that she and her wife were the lucky ones. ""Not everybody got to say goodbye to their homes - we did. Our pets are with us. We know people whose pets got stuck in their houses...we know people that are missing."" Sam and Micah are currently staying with a friend, hoping to get a hotel room through insurance. But she doesn't know what six months down the line looks like now that they've lost their home. She says she has no clue ""how to traverse any of this"".

EU ultimatum to UK over Brexit talks,"The EU is demanding the UK ditches plans to change Boris Johnson's Brexit deal ""by the end of the month"" or risk jeopardising trade talks. The UK has published a bill to rewrite parts of the withdrawal agreement it signed in January. The EU said this had ""seriously damaged trust"" and it would not be ""shy"" of taking legal action against the UK. But cabinet minister Michael Gove said the UK had made it ""perfectly clear"" it would not withdraw the bill. The government says Parliament is sovereign and can pass laws which breach the UK's international treaty obligations. EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier said ""trust and confidence are and will be key"", after the latest round of UK-EU trade talks wrapped up in London on Thursday. His UK counterpart David Frost said ""significant"" differences remained over a free trade deal, but added discussions would continue in Brussels next week. Kuenssberg: Brexit deal stand-off threatens trade talks How could the Northern Ireland Brexit deal change? Lords' anger over 'hypocritical' Brexit bill Senior government lawyer quits over Brexit plans Chicken, cheese, cod: The tricky trade talk menu The source of the EU's concern is Mr Johnson's proposed Internal Market Bill,which was published on Wednesday,external. It addresses the Northern Ireland Protocol - an element of the withdrawal agreement designed to prevent a hard border returning to the island of Ireland. The bill proposes no new checks on goods moving from Northern Ireland to Great Britain. It gives UK ministers powers to modify or ""disapply"" rules relating to the movement of goods that will come into force from 1 January, if the UK and EU are unable to strike a trade deal. The publication of the bill prompted emergency talks between Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove and Maros Å efÄoviÄ, the European Commission Vice-President. After two sets of meetings today - one on the trade talks and the other on the government's plans to rewrite part of the agreed treaty from last year - there has been nothing less than a diplomatic explosion. The EU issued a statement that was about as furious as any I've ever seen in this kind of context - demanding that the UK government withdraw the controversial plans to override the deal done with the EU last year by the end of the month, and threatening to take legal action if it doesn't happen. Essentially saying that there's no chance of trade talks, and hence no chance of a deal, unless the UK backs down. At this stage, however, anyone with more than a passing acquaintance with this government would know that's inconceivable. It is not, of course, impossible that further down the track the government may give way, or concede in quite a big way. But right now, the chances of a move are slim to none. Read more from Laura here. Following the discussions, the EU issued a strongly-worded statement warning that the withdrawal agreement was a legal obligation, adding that ""neither the EU nor the UK can unilaterally change, clarify, amend, interpret, disregard or disapply the agreement"". The EU rejected the UK's arguments that the bill is designed to protect peace in Northern Ireland arguing that ""it does the opposite"". Mr Å efÄoviÄ said that if the bill were to be adopted, it would constitute an ""extremely serious violation"" of the withdrawal agreement and of international law. He urged the government to withdraw the bill ""by the end of the month"", adding that the withdrawal agreement ""contains a number of mechanisms and legal remedies to address violations of the legal obligations contained in the text - which the European Union will not be shy in using"". Germany's UK ambassador said he had not experienced ""such a fast, intentional and profound deterioration of a negotiation"" in his diplomatic career. ""If you believe in partnership between the UK and the EU like I do then don't accept it,"" hetweeted,external. Michael Gove arrives at the Cabinet Office ahead of talks with EU officials In its response, the UK government said it would ""discharge its treaty obligations in good faith"", but added that ""in the difficult and highly exceptional circumstances in which we find ourselves, it is important to remember the fundamental principle of parliamentary sovereignty"". ""Parliament is sovereign as a matter of domestic law and can pass legislation which is in breach of the UK's treaty obligations. Parliament would not be acting unconstitutionally in enacting such legislation. ""Treaty obligations only become binding to the extent that they are enshrined in domestic legislation. Whether to enact or repeal legislation, and the content of that legislation, is for Parliament and Parliament alone."" Mr Gove ""said that, during the talks, he had ""made it perfectly clear that we would not be withdrawing this legislation"", adding that the government was ""absolutely serious"". The Internal Market Bill will be formally debated by MPs in Parliament for the first time on Monday, 14 September. It has come under increasing criticism from Conservative parliamentarians. Former party leader Lord Howard said it would damage the UK's ""reputation for probity and respect for the rule of law"", while former Chancellor Lord Lamont asked ministers to ""think again"". But Mr Gove said: ""I'm looking forward to the second reading of the bill next week. It's an opportunity for the government to set out in detail why we have this legislation."" He promised to fight for ""unfettered access for goods from Northern Ireland to the rest of the United Kingdom"". Mr Johnson has defended the bill, saying it would ""ensure the integrity of the UK internal market"" and hand power to Scotland and Wales, while protecting the Northern Ireland peace process. But critics say the move will damage the UK's international reputation aftera minister admitted the plans break international law. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer urged the government to consider ""the reputational risk that it's taking in the proposed way forward"". Meanwhile, the latest round of formal talks over a post-Brexit trade deal concluded in London on Thursday. Speaking afterwards, Mr Barnier said the EU had ""shown flexibility"" in an effort to ""find solutions"", but the UK had not ""not engaged"" on some ""major issues"". For the UK side, Lord Frost said ""challenging areas remain and the divergences on some are still significant"". He said the UK negotiators ""remain committed"" to reaching a deal by the middle of October and officials would ""continue discussions"" next week.

Brexit trade talks set to resume despite fallout,"Boris Johnson has urged Conservative MPs to back his plan to override part of the Brexit withdrawal agreement. In a Zoom call with around 250 of them, he said the party must not return to ""miserable squabbling"" over Europe. The EU has warned the UK it could face legal action if it does not ditch controversial elements of the Internal Market Bill by the end of the month. And a Tory MP has proposed an amendment to the bill, which would affect trade between Britain and Northern Ireland. Meanwhile, the European Parliament has threatened to scupper any UK-EU trade deal if the bill becomes UK law. Analysis: Despite bitter Brexit row can deal still be done? UK signs first major post-Brexit trade deal Brexit to dominate week ahead in Parliament UK at odds with EU over approval for food exports The two sides have less than five weeks to agree a deal before Mr Johnson's 15 October deadline - after which he says he is prepared to ""walk away"". Informal talks are due to resume on Monday, with the next official round of talks - the ninth since March - starting in Brussels on 28 September. TheInternal Market Bill,external, which will be formally debated in the House of Commons for the first time on Monday, addresses the Northern Ireland Protocol - the part of the Brexit withdrawal agreement designed to prevent a hard border returning to the island of Ireland. If it became law it would give UK ministers powers to modify or ""disapply"" rules relating to the movement of goods between Britain and Northern Ireland that will come into force from 1 January, if the UK and EU are unable to strike a trade deal. The EU says the planned changes must be scrappedor they risk jeopardising the UK-EU trade talks. But the government has rejected this demand, arguing the measures in the bill are needed to protect the integrity of the UK and the peace process in Northern Ireland. Lords' anger over 'hypocritical' Brexit bill Kuenssberg: Brexit deal stand-off threatens trade talks How many trade deals has the UK done? In his Zoom call with MPs on Friday, the prime minister did not take questions and a poor signal meant the video and audio connections were lost for several minutes. He called for ""overwhelming support"" for the bill, describing it as ""absolutely vital"" to ""prevent a foreign or international body from having the power to break up our country"". Mr Johnson added that he would not countenance ""the threat of a border down the Irish Sea"". But he said there was still a ""very good chance"" of the UK and EU striking a deal by mid-October similar to that previouslyagreed between the EU and Canada- which got rid of most, but not all, tariffs on goods. BBC chief political correspondent Vicki Young said Tory MPs were ""looking for a sign of compromise"" from Mr Johnson, as they ""simply can't believe the government is prepared to break international law"", but the prime minister ""dug his heels in"". In a column in the Daily Telegraph,external, Mr Johnson accused the EU of reinterpreting the Withdrawal Agreement to ""destroy the economic and territorial integrity of the UK"" and ""endanger peace and stability in Northern Ireland"". ""I have to say that we never seriously believed that the EU would be willing to use a treaty, negotiated in good faith, to blockade one part of the UK, to cut it off,"" he said. Conservative backbencher Sir Bob Neill, who chairs the Commons Justice Committee, said he was not reassured by the prime minister's Zoom call. He is tabling an amendment to the bill to try to force a separate parliamentary vote on any changes to the Withdrawal Agreement. ""I believe it is potentially a harmful act for this country, it would damage our reputation and I think it will make it harder to strike trade deals going forward,"" he said. At around the same time as the prime minister was speaking, the European Parliament announced it would ""under no circumstances ratify"" any trade deal reached between the UK and EU if the ""UK authorities breach or threaten to breach"" the withdrawal agreement. Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis has admitted parts of the bill, which would go against a treaty signed by the UK and EU, would ""break international law in a very specific and limited way"". There is unease over this within the Conservative Party, with former leaders Theresa May, Lord Howard and Sir John Major urging Mr Johnson to think again.

What are the planned Brexit deal changes?,"The government has said it is willing to drop parts of a controversial piece of legislation - the Internal Market Bill - which had the potential to further complicate the already tense trade talks between the UK and the EU. It contains measures relating to the way trade will be done between Northern Ireland and Great Britain in the future. They would only come into force if the UK and the EU failed to reach a trade deal. But they would overrule parts of the Brexit withdrawal agreement the UK signed with the EU last year. The House of Lordsvoted to remove the offending clausesfrom the bill in November but the House of Commons then voted to reinstate them. The government now says it is willing to withdraw them because of an ""agreement in principle"" on a range of issues affecting Northern Ireland. So, what is the controversy about? The withdrawal agreement (also known as the Brexit ""divorce deal"") includes a section - or protocol - on Northern Ireland, and it is now an international treaty. Article 4 of the agreement says the provisions of the treaty take legal precedence over anything in the UK's domestic law. So if any of the proposals in theInternal Market Bill,externalthat contradict the withdrawal agreement actually became law, it would breach the government's international obligations. That is what the Northern Ireland Secretary, Brandon Lewis referred to in September when he spoke about breaking international law in a ""very specific and limited way"". Breaking the law, though, is still breaking the law. The overall aim of the Northern Ireland protocol was to avoid the return of a ""hard"" land border between Northern Ireland, in the UK, and the Republic of Ireland, in the EU. All sides agreed they did not want the return of border checks - or other physical infrastructure - that could become a target. What is the Northern Ireland protocol? One of the solutions in the treaty was to keep Northern Ireland in the EU single market for goods, unlike the rest of the United Kingdom. People protesting between Newry and Dundalk about a possible hard border, in March 2019 It promised to maintain unfettered access for Northern Ireland goods to the rest of the UK but also introduced new bureaucracy for trade across the Irish Sea. The way these measures will be implemented on the ground have been negotiated by UK and EU officials, who have been meeting in a joint committee for the past few months. If there was no agreement by the end of the transition period, on 31 December 2020, and there was no free-trade deal, that is when parts of this new proposed legislation would have come into play. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. For example, the protocol states that companies moving goods from Northern Ireland to Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) would have to fill out export declaration forms. But the government's Internal Market Bill would give ministers the right to overrule or ignore this part of EU customs law. Another part of the protocol says the UK has to follow EU rules on state aid - the financial support governments give to businesses - for goods related to Northern Ireland. But the Internal Market Bill would give ministers power to interpret what that means and says this should not be done in accordance with the case law of the European Court of Justice. The EU said this was trying to change parts of a recently-agreed international treaty unilaterally. And when the legislation was first published, US President-elect Joe Biden warned that the Good Friday peace agreement in Northern Ireland ""cannot become a casualty of Brexit"". But on 8 December, the UK and EU announced an""an agreement in principle"",externalon issues including border control posts, the supply of food and medicines and clarification around state aid in Northern Ireland. As a result, the government said it would drop the controversial clauses in the bill. The Internal Market Bill only deals with trade from Northern Ireland to Great Britain, but the debate about goods moving in the opposite direction is equally sensitive. The protocol says the joint committee is supposed to determine which goods moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland are ""at risk"" of being exported over the Irish border to the EU and should therefore have tariffs - taxes on imports - imposed on them. If there was no agreement between the two sides, then the default position would be tariffs paid on all goods. The UK had plans, due to be introduced in a Taxation Bill, to allow UK ministers to make unilateral decisions on which goods could be deemed as ""at risk"" - after 1 January. But, as a result of the ""agreement in principle"" - the government says these measures won't now be introduced. What claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

Rio Tinto boss to quit over Aboriginal cave blastsJean-Sebastien Jacques and other senior executives will step down after the miner blew up sacred sites.,"Jean-SÃ©bastien Jacques has been Rio Tinto's chief executive since 2016 The boss of Rio Tinto, Jean-SÃ©bastien Jacques, will step down following criticism of the mining giant's destruction of sacred Aboriginal sites. In May, the world's biggest iron ore miner destroyed two ancient caves in Pilbara, Western Australia. The company went ahead with blowing up the Juukan Gorge rock shelters despite the opposition of Aboriginal traditional owners. It sparked widespread condemnation from shareholders and the public. Church of England attacks miner for Aboriginal blasts Rio bosses lose bonuses over indigenous site destruction On Friday, the company said in a statement: ""Significant stakeholders have expressed concerns about executive accountability for the failings identified."" The board said Mr Jacques would remain as the chief executive until March or until a successor was appointed. Other senior executives, including the heads of the miner's iron ore and corporate relations divisions, will also leave the company at the end of the year. The caves - seen as one of Australia's most significant archaeological research sites - had shown evidence of continuous human habitation dating back 46,000 years. They sat above about eight million tonnes of high-grade iron ore, with an estimated value of Â£75m (A$132m; $96m). Juukan Gorge cave sites, seen before and after the destruction Australia's parliament is currently holding an inquiry into the miner's actions. Rio Tinto also held its own inquiry earlier this year, after which the company cut bonuses for directors and began attempts at repairing relations with Aboriginal communities. ""What happened at Juukan was wrong and we are determined to ensure that the destruction of a heritage site of such exceptional archaeological and cultural significance never occurs again at a Rio Tinto operation,"" said chairman Simon Thompson. Artefacts found at the caves include a 28,000-year-old animal bone tool and a 4,000-year-old belt made of plaited human hair. DNA testing had directly linked it to the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura (PKKP) people - the traditional owners of the land. After the caves were destroyed, a PKKP representative, John Ashburton, said losing the site was a ""devastating blow"". ""There are less than a handful of known Aboriginal sites in Australia that are as old as this one... Its importance cannot be underestimated,"" he said. Last week it was revealed that in the days running up to the caves' destruction in May, Rio Tinto hired lawyers in case opponents tried to seek injunctions to stop them. Although the company said it had permission for the work under Aboriginal heritage laws, critics said it suggested the miner was aware of the site's cultural importance. In June,rival miner BHP also halted its plans to expand its minein the Pilbara region in June following the outcry over Rio's actions. Last month, Rio Tinto said it had cut Mr Jacques' bonus by Â£2.7m. It also said Chris Salisbury, chief executive of iron ore, and Simone Niven, group executive of corporate relations, would lose more than half a million pounds each. But Tom Stevenson, investment director at Fidelity International, said Rio Tinto's actions had been ""slow and misguided"". ""It was slow because when it knew the significance of those sites it could have reversed its position and it didn't,"" he said. ""And it is misguided because when it cut bonuses recently it effectively put a price on something which is basically priceless and I think that that was tin-eared really. I'm not surprised that we've moved onto this stage where the chief executive felt that he had to go."" The cultural value of the Juukan Gorge shelters is huge and so is the loss. This decision to let the CEO go could be seen as a vindication after months of ongoing pressure from traditional landowners, other Aboriginal groups and shareholders who refused to stand for the destruction of one of Australia's most important archaeological sites. The scandal also highlights the great imbalance of power between Australia's influential mining industry and traditional landowners; and what the government's responsibility should be to ensure the protection of historical and ancestral sites. Last month Mr Jacques and two senior executives were stripped of their multimillion-dollar bonuses for 2020. The move seemed to have backfired. Many saw cutting the pay of already very high-earning executives as showing a clear lack of touch, and nowhere near a satisfactory retribution for those responsible for overseeing community relations. Rio Tinto chairman Simon Thompson said that the mining giant was determined to regain the trust of the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura people and other traditional owners. But given how they've handled this scandal, it's hard to see that happening any time soon.

Greece to EU: Words alone will not help migrantsGreece is struggling to find shelter to thousands of migrants left homeless after a fire at a camp.Europe,"This video can not be played The BBC's Jean Mackenzie reflects on her experiences at the camp Greece has urged European countries to ""move from words of solidarity"" to action as it struggles to find shelter for thousands of migrants left homeless after a fire destroyed their camp. Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis' comments were echoed by German Chancellor Angela Merkel who said the EU must share more responsibility. France, Germany and the Netherlands have offered to take in some migrants. About 13,000 people had been living in squalor in the Moria camp on Lesbos. For a third night families were sleeping on roads, in fields, car parks and even in a cemetery after fleeing the camp. The government said it would take days to find accommodation for them. Near the ruins of Moria - Greece's largest camp - local residents blocked roads to stop charities from delivering aid and said they were against the construction of new tents. How the migrant crisis changed Europe Med's deadly migrant crisis: In maps and charts Protecting yourself from coronavirus in a migrant camp Prime Minister Mitsotakis said the migrant crisis was Europe's problem, and concrete action was needed by the EU to tackle it. ""Europe must move from words of solidarity to a policy of acts of solidarity,"" he was quoted as saying by AFP news agency at a summit of Mediterranean leaders in Corsica. This video can not be played Migrants are struggling to cope out in the open Mrs Merkel said she had agreed ""as a preliminary step"" to a request by Mr Mitsotakis to take in some 400 unaccompanied minors who had been transferred from Lesbos to the Greek mainland. ""Germany and France will participate in this. I hope several other [EU] member states will do so too,"" she said. ""Migration is not just the problem of the countries where people arrive. Neither is it just Germany's problem. It must become more of a European responsibility."" The Netherlands agreed to take in 50 children. Touring the burnt-out Moria site on Thursday, European Commission's Vice-President Margaritis Schinas said it was ""inconceivable"" that the EU did not yet have a unified migration policy. He said the commission's proposals for a new pact on migration and asylum, due to be presented later this month, would ""put an end to this unacceptable situation"". How to deal with the mass arrivals of migrants, mainly to Italy and Greece, has divided the EU for years. Italy and Greece have accused wealthier northern countries of failing to do more, while a number of central and eastern nations are openly resistant to the idea of taking in a quota of migrants. Thousands of migrants have been left homeless after the fire Greece is sending three ships to Lesbos to provide accommodation for some 2,000 migrants. The Blue Star Chios ferry, which has capacity to house 1,000 people, has now docked at the Lesbos port of Sigri. Two naval vessels are also on their way. About 35 people who fled the fires on Tuesday and Wednesday night had tested positive for Covid-19. Eight of them are believed to have been located and isolated since the fires broke out. On a parking lot outside a supermarket on Thursday, hundreds of migrants, including families with small children, waited for bottled water and food to be distributed. ""There is no food, no milk for the baby,"" Congolese migrant Natzy Malala, who had a newborn infant and an eight-year-old girl, told Reuters news agency. Any attempt by the authorities to rebuild the Moira camp may be met by hostility from local residents. ""Now is the time to shut down Moria for good,"" Vangelis Violatzis, a local municipal leader, told AFP. ""We don't want another camp, and we will oppose any construction work. We've faced this situation for five years, it's time for others to bear this burden."" Child migrants sleep in pens at Lesbos port.

"Pringles try to wake from 'recycling nightmare'Kellog redesigns the snackfood container that was dubbed the ""number one villain"" for recycling.","New designs are being trialled that still ""pop"" when they open The distinctive Pringles tube is being re-designed after criticism that itâs almost impossible to recycle. The current container for the potato-based snack was condemned asa recyclerâs nightmare. It's a complex construction with a metal base, plastic cap, metal tear-off lid, and foil-lined cardboard sleeve. The Recycling Association dubbed it the number one recycling villain â along with the Lucozade Sports bottle. Now Pringles' maker Kellogg's is trialling a simpler can â although experts say itâs not a full solution. The existing version is particularly troublesome because it combines so many different materials This video can not be played Roger Harrabin considers the Pringles recycling challenge Some 90% of the new can is paper. Around 10% is a polyal (plastic) barrier that seals the interior to protect the food against oxygen and moisture which would damage the taste. But how about the lid? Well, two options are on trial in some Tesco stores â a recyclable plastic lid and a recyclable paper lid. Kellogg's says these lids will still produce the distinctive ""pop"" associated with the product. Simon Ellin from the Recycling Association told BBC News: ""The Pringles tube has been a bastion of bad design from the recyclers' point of view. ""This new version is an improvement, and we broadly welcome it. ""But, frankly, if they are going to stick to a plastic lid thatâll just add to problems with plastic pollution - people on picnics leave them behind and they find their way into streams and the sea. That plastic lid has got to go."" The Recycling Association said many manufacturers needed to rethink their packaging Kellogg's says its packaging must be airtight, or the food inside will be wasted. The new designs have been 12 months in the making. Pringles have a shelf life of 15 months - and three million cans are made across Europe every day. Mr Ellin said the polyal-coated card might be recyclable but the product would need to be tested in recycling mills. And what of the much-criticised Lucozade Sports bottle? Mr Ellin said its unchanged basic design was still a big problem, as machines found it hard to differentiate the plastic in the bottle and the plastic that makes up its outer sleeve. He called on the makers, Suntory, to reduce the size of the external sleeve, as it has with the new Ribena bottle. The firm said it was planning to do this for the new year. Suntory said it was working on a new material made entirely from seaweed extract that was 100% edible, biodegradable and compostable. Environmentalists say that trivial changes like these won't solve the world's ecological crises - but on a large scale they'll make a contribution.
