UK Parliament declares climate emergency,"MPs have approved a motion to declare an environment and climate emergency. This proposal, which demonstrates the will of the Commons on the issue but does not legally compel the government to act, was approved without a vote. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who tabled the motion, said it was ""a huge step forward"". Environment Secretary Michael Gove acknowledged there was a climate ""emergency"" but did not back Labour's demands to declare one. The declaration of an emergency was one of the key demands put to the government by environmental activist group Extinction Rebellion, ina series of protestsover recent weeks. Addressing climate protesters from the top of a fire engine in Parliament Square earlier, Mr Corbyn said: ""This can set off a wave of action from parliaments and governments around the globe. ""We pledge to work as closely as possible with countries that are serious about ending the climate catastrophe and make clear to US President Donald Trump that he cannot ignore international agreements and action on the climate crisis."" Thousands of Scottish school pupils took part in climate protests last month Dozens of towns and cities across the UK have already declared ""a climate emergency"". There is no single definition of what that means but many local areas say they want to be carbon-neutral by 2030. Some councils have promised to introduce electric car hubs or build sustainable homes to try to achieve that goal. It's a much more ambitious target than the UK government's, which is to reduce carbon emissions by 80% (compared to 1990 levels) by 2050. Read more here Labour's motion also calls on the government to aim to achieve net-zero emissions before 2050 and for ministers to outline urgent proposals to restore the UK's natural environment and deliver a ""zero waste economy"" within the next six months. TheWelshandScottishgovernments have both already declared a climate emergency, along with dozens of towns and cities, including Manchester and London.

Universities 'must tackle race degree gap',"Sociology student Amna Atteeq says positive role models are crucial Universities must ""accelerate efforts"" to close a gap in degree attainment between white and black, Asian and minority ethnic students, a study says. Universities UK and the National Union of Students highlight a 13% gap between the chances of white and BAME students getting a first or upper second degree. UUK and the NUS say campuses need a culture change to feel more inclusive. ""To make sure our gap closes, there need to be initiatives,"" says Aston University student Amna Atteeq. ""And we are more than happy to get involved,"" says Amna, who contributed to the UUK and NUS research. ""But we need to know where we need to start and what we need to look for. We want university support looking at the curriculum, at other staff members at the university or at having other talks from people who have succeeded in careers and bringing them back to inspire our students."" Ethnicity pay gap for academics revealed 'I'm mixed-race, is Cambridge right for me?' Should race count in university admissions? Joel Simpson, from the University of the Arts in London, who also contributed to the research, added: ""I think it's definitely key that the staff interrogate the data behind attainment gaps. ""But they need to understand the nuances, the factors that lead to those attainment gaps. That can only really be gained by immersing themselves within the student body, getting a clear understanding of students' day-to-day lives and how students move through the college. ""Sometimes it can be the smallest things that affect a student's mindset."" Joel Simpson says subtle issues are important For Amna, who is coming towards the end of her term as Student Union president at Aston, giving BAME students good role models is crucial to raising aspirations. ""I think there's this unconscious bias with students that, if they don't see their role models in certain careers at university or in certain careers, in companies, they automatically take them out of line of their future career. ""And for us to tackle that, it's really important to have certain role models at university, or bring people on board through talks, to show our students that they have made it in certain companies or career paths."" The report acknowledges that many universities have worked to reduce the attainment gap, but says that with 81% of white students getting a first or 2:1 in 2017-18 compared with 68% of BAME students, more must be done. It highlights five ways that universities can improve outcomes: provide strong leadership - university leaders should demonstrate a commitment to removing the BAME attainment gap and lead by example have conversations about race and changing cultures develop racially diverse and inclusive environments, ensuring that BAME students have a good sense of belonging gather and analyse data on the attainment gap understand what works - universities can share evidence of what works and what does not UUK is asking vice-chancellors to sign up to an online pledge to work with students. Meanwhile, the Office for Students (OfS) has set a target for the higher education sector to eliminate the unexplained gap in degree outcomes by 2024-25. Baroness Amos, director of SOAS, who co-led the report, said: ""Our universities are racially and culturally diverse, compared to many other sectors, but we are failing a generation of students if we don't act now to reduce the BAME attainment gap. ""It is important that universities act and are transparent in their approach so black, Asian and minority ethnic students are given the best chance of success."" Amatey Doku, NUS vice-president for higher education, said that universities had presided over significant gaps in attainment between BAME students and white students ""for far too long"". ""From decolonising the curriculum to more culturally competent support services, many students and students' unions have been fighting and campaigning for action in this area for years. ""This report highlights good practice and clear practical steps for universities to take to begin to respond to many of the concerns raised."" Chris Millward, director for fair access and participation at the OfS, said the report was ""welcome and timely"". ""The OfS has set a target for the higher education sector to eliminate the unexplained gap in degree outcomes between white and black students by 2024-25. ""In order to do this, universities must take urgent action to understand what is causing these differences, and reduce the gaps so that all students - whatever their background - are given every opportunity to reap the rewards that higher education can bring.""

Teenager killed in Hackney stabbing,"The boy was found injured in the Somerford Grove area of Hackney A teenage boy has been stabbed to death in an attack in Hackney, east London. The 15-year-old victim was found injured in Somerford Grove at about 21:00 BST on Wednesday and died shortly after, police said. A shopkeeper said a boy ran into his store pleading for help, saying he had been stabbed in the back. A second boy, aged 16, found nearby Shacklewell Road, was also stabbed but did not sustain life-threatening injuries. A man from Elif Food Centre, who did not want to be named, told BBC London he tried to help one of the victims. He said: ""One boy came running into the shop last night saying 'I have been stabbed in the back. Help me. Help me.' ""We called an ambulance and now police have seized our CCTV."" Two friends of the victim spoke of their shock after visiting the crime scene. One said: ""It came as a surprise to us because he was a good guy. ""We did music together. He didn't only produce afrobeats, he made drill music as well. He also sold some beats to some big artists. ""I never thought that any of my friends would be murdered. I'm shocked."" The other friend added: ""I saw him the day before yesterday. He was a good friend, a nice lad. ""I'm so done. It doesn't feel safe any more."" The 15-year-old boy is one of the youngest victims to be stabbed to death in London so far this year Police said a Section 60 stop-and-search order had been put in place for the whole of Hackney. No arrests have been made in connection with the killing. Met Commissioner Cressida Dick described it as a ""terrible, terrible thing"" as the force revealed statistics showing a drop in homicides compared to the previous financial year. Data compares 2017-18 and 2018-19 financial years 311Fewer knife crime victims under the age of 25 32Fewer homicide victims Speaking about the latest stabbing in Hackney, Ms Dick said the two boys were with a group of other boys and a girl, adding there was ""some sort of confrontation with another group"". Leigh Milner, BBC News Another boy, aged 16, was found stabbed near the crime scene Just off a busy main road there is a huge cordon surrounding the Somerford Grove estate. Elif Food Centre, a 24-hour off-licence, is also taped off as police officers stand guard. Right in the middle of the cordon a big blue tent can be seen - the spot where the victim died. Residents have been telling me they are shocked and scared as only six days ago another person was stabbed to death in Hackney. Hours later, officers were called to another, unrelated, stabbing near Camden Town Tube station. A man suffered ""life-threatening"" injuries in the attack on Camden Road shortly after midnight. So far this year, more than 40 murder investigations have been launched in the capital by the Metropolitan Police and British Transport Police. Twenty-nine of those cases are stabbing investigations. London mayor Sadiq Khan said he was ""deeply saddened"" by the latest killing. ""This horrific violence has absolutely no place on our streets,"" he said.

MP first to be ousted under recall rules,"Fiona Onasanya was expelled by the Labour Party after her conviction Disgraced Fiona Onasanya has become the first MP to be removed by a recall petition. Ms Onasanya, 35, was jailed in January for lying about a speeding offence. She was expelled by Labour after her conviction and had been representing Peterborough as an independent. Peterborough City Council said 19,261 constituents had signed the petition. Ms Onasanya will be allowed to stand for re-election. The council said the signatures represented 27.6% of eligible residents. The threshold required to remove Ms Onasanya was 10%. Commons Speaker John Bercow confirmed the recall petition had been successful. He told MPs: ""Fiona Onasanya is no longer the member for Peterborough and the seat is accordingly vacant. ""She can therefore no longer participate in any parliamentary proceedings as a member of parliament."" Ms Onasanya, who was jailed for perverting the course of justice, has become the first MP to be removed by the recall process, introduced by David Cameron in 2015. She was first elected to Parliament as a Labour MP with a slender majority of 607 in 2017. The process by which the electorate can remove an MP before the end of their term was introduced in the UK in 2015 in response to the 2010 MPs' expenses scandal. The recall procedure can only be triggered under certain circumstances, including if an MP is convicted in the UK of an offence and sentenced or ordered to be imprisoned or detained - and all appeals have been exhausted. For a recall petition to be successful, 10% of eligible registered voters need to sign the petition. It remains open for six weeks. If successful, a by-election is called and the recalled MP is allowed to stand as a candidate. The first recall petition against an MP was triggered in July 2018 against North Antrim MP Ian Paisley after he failed to declare two holidays paid for by the Sri Lankan government. The petition was unsuccessful, as it was short of 444 signatures, and Mr Paisley remained an MP. The petition against Ms Onasanya is the first time a recall petition has been held in England. A third MP, Chris Davies, Conservative member for Brecon and Radnorshire,is facing a recall petitionin Wales after he was convicted for a false expenses claim. Source:UK Parliament,external Labour Party chairman Ian Lavery said: ""Labour campaigned hard for a victory in this recall petition. ""Labour will vigorously fight the by-election here in Peterborough."" Nigel Farage said his new Brexit Party would contest the by-election, but a spokesman said no decision had yet been taken on whether Mr Farage would be the candidate. The by-election in a city which voted 61% Leave in the 2016 EU referendum potentially offers the former UKIP leader a route to a seat in Parliament after seven unsuccessful attempts. Meanwhile, the former MP George Galloway - a Brexiteer - also declared on Twitter hisintention to stand in the by-election.,external Conservative parliamentary candidate for Peterborough Paul Bristow said: ""The people of Peterborough deserve a better MP who will vote in Parliament to deliver Brexit."" Fiona Onasanya made her first and last speech in the Commons last week following her release from prison Hannah Olsson, political reporter, BBC Radio Cambridgeshire The by-election in Peterborough will come in the middle of one of the most tumultuous times in modern political history. Brexit has shaken up political alliances like never before, but we don't know what impact that will have, and who it will favour. The by-election could be an opportunity for the new parties to test the popularity of what they're offering, but the question is what party will they be taking voters from? Another possibility is that Brexit has made everyone so fed up with politics that people in Peterborough will just decide not to vote at all, and we will see a very low turnout.

UK 'can cut emissions to nearly zero',"Protesters at a ""die in"" in Glasgow The UK should lead the global fight against climate change by cutting greenhouse gases to nearly zero by 2050, a report says. The Committee on Climate Change (CCC) maintains this can be done at no added cost from previous estimates. Its report says that if other countries follow the UK, thereâs a 50-50 chance of staying below the recommended 1.5C temperature rise by 2100. A 1.5C rise is considered the threshold for dangerous climate change. Some say the proposed 2050 target for near-zero emissions is too soft, but others will fear the goal could damage the UK's economy. The CCC - the independent adviser to government on climate change - said it would not be able to hit ânet zeroâ emissions any sooner, but 2050 was still an extremely significant goal. The main author Chris Stark told me: âThis report would have been absolutely inconceivable just a few years ago. People would have laughed us out of court for suggesting that the target could be so high.â The main change, he said, was the huge drop in the cost of renewable energy prompted by government policies to nurture solar and wind power. Climate change: Where we are in seven charts Will the government pay you to go green? What do all the climate change terms mean? What is climate change? He said the BBC's David Attenborough climate documentary,protests by Extinction Rebellionand speeches by theteenage campaigner Greta Thunberghad persuaded the public that the problem needed urgent action. But Mr Stark said there was no way the 2050 target would be achieved unless the government backed it with policies and money. He noted that the UK was already slipping away from a legal obligation to cut its emissions step-by-step between now and 2032. This video can not be played Teen activist Greta Thunberg addresses Extinction Rebellion rally The cost of the new proposal, the CCC estimates, is tens of billions of pounds a year and may reach to 1-2% of national wealth (as measured by GDP) each year by 2050. That doesnât count the benefits of decarbonisation - such as cleaner air and water. The CCC said England can eliminate emissions by 2050, whileScotland could go carbon-free sooner - by 2045. Scotland has exceptional potential for planting trees (which absorb carbon dioxide) and is more suited for carbon capture and storage. Wales can only cut 95% of its emissions by 2050because of its farm industry.Northern Ireland will follow Englandâs targets. The government is studying the report, which has substantial implications for public finances, and says it ""sets us on a path to become the first major economy to legislate to end our contribution to global warming entirely"". The plan is for ânet zeroâ emissions by 2050, which means balancing carbon emissions with carbon removal. In practice, we'll need to slash the amount of CO2 we put in the atmosphere. Unavoidable emissions need to be captured and stored (for example, where CO2 is collected from a power station chimney and put underground) or offset by planting trees. Until now, the target had been to reduce emissions by 80% compared with 1990 levels by 2050. The CCC believes that achieving zero emissions depends on low-carbon technologies and changes to industry, and public behaviour. Here are some of the report's recommendations for the public. Home heating The report has one controversial recommendation: to turn down the home thermostat to 19C in winter. We will need to insulate our homes much better. Some of us will use heat pumps - a sort of reverse refrigeration technology that sucks warmth from the ground - and convert natural gas boilers to hydrogen ones. The committee expects consumer bills to rise at first, then fall as a newer, cheaper electricity generators are introduced. Flying The aviation industry is trying to bring down the cost of making jet fuels from waste materials. But the CCC says this wonât be enough. The number of flights we take is increasing, and the report predicts that government action will be needed to constrain the growth. However, it doesnât say how â and the committee chair, John Gummer, ducked a question about Heathrow expansion at the report's launch. Cars The report says we won't need to overhaul our motoring habits, but eventually we will be driving electric cars. The government has set a target date of 2040 beyond which conventional car sales will be banned. However,the committee says that deadline should be 2030. Meat The committee notes many people are already eating less red meat for the health of the planet and themselves. It says people can reduce their diet-related emissions by 35% if they transition from a high-meat diet to a low-meat one. But it only predicts a 20% drop in meat consumption by 2050. Waste Bio-degradable waste should not be sent to landfill after 2025. This means we would all be obliged to separate our food waste from other rubbish. The report recommends reducing food waste as far as possible. This video can not be played Strangers are sharing unwanted food in a bid to save money and reduce food waste. The CCC says people can also take the following steps: Choosing to walk, cycle or take public transport Choosing LED light-bulbs and electric appliances with high energy efficiency ratings Setting the water temperature in their heating systems to no higher than 55C Using only peat-free compost Choosing quality products that last longer and sharing rather than buying items, like power tools, that are used infrequently Checking your pension funds and ISAs to see if your investments support low-carbon industries The big push is to decarbonise industry and heat generation. Carbon capture technology will be needed on many of the major emitters: the steel, paper, aluminium and paper industries. Farmers would need to find ways to reduce methane emissions from cows Agriculture is a major emitter of greenhouse gases through sheep and cattle burping methane, and from fertilisers. Farmers would need to reduce the amount of land in pasture, increase woodland, and feed cattle food that creates less methane gas. The fracking industry would also be affected - the committee says we should only use fracked gas in the UK if it replaces gas that would otherwise be imported. Climate change food calculator: What's your diet's carbon footprint? What is a climate emergency? How can I help? Environmental groups are supportive - although many think 2050 is too conservative. The UK Health Alliance on Climate Change has called on the government to adopt the recommendations but ""adopt a net-zero target before 2050"". Lorna Greenwood of Extinction Rebellion told me: ""2050 condemns us to a bleak future... Others are already dying round the world thanks to inaction and far-off target setting."" The environmental campaign group WWF has said: âThe problem is, weâve been acting as if we have time. But if we want a world with coral reefs, safe coastal cities and enough food for everyone, we must act now."" Business and industry groups have expressed support but argue they need government help. Rain Newton-Smith, chief economist at the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) said: âThe UK should do all it can to mitigate the worst impacts of climate change. What we need now is a supportive and timely response from the government to enact this ambitious target."" Sign up for a weekly chat about climate change on Facebook Messenger,external Meanwhile, Minette Batters, president of the farm union NFU, told me: âWe take the climate issue very seriously. With Brexit and the governmentâs Agriculture Bill the government can shift farm support towards helping farmers reduce greenhouse gas emissions.â Meanwhile, Dr Shaun Fitzgerald, director of The Royal Institution, said: âI am a massive supporter of efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. But he added: ""Will people be prepared to set their winter time thermostat to 19C? Asking people to put up with a reduction in comfort/quality is going to be difficult.""

Scientists find cocaine in shrimpsResearchers collected samples from rivers in Suffolk and found the drug when testing for chemicals.,"Researchers collected freshwater shrimp from rivers in Suffolk Scientists found cocaine in freshwater shrimps when testing rivers for chemicals, a study said. Researchers at King's College London, in collaboration with the University of Suffolk, tested 15 different locations across Suffolk. Their report said cocaine was found in all samples tested. Other illicit drugs, such as ketamine, were also widespread in the shrimp. The researchers said it was a ""surprising"" finding. Professor Nic Bury, from the University of Suffolk, said: ""Whether the presence of cocaine in aquatic animals is an issue for Suffolk, or more widespread an occurrence in the UK and abroad, awaits further research.

Has Leeds cracked the obesity problem?,"Childhood obesity is a major problem. But now news has emerged that one city - Leeds - has been making some progress. Figures presented to the European Congress on Obesity suggest Leeds has managed to reduce the number of children who are extremely overweight. The data showed there had been a 6.4% fall in obesity rates over recent years. Record number of severely obese children World's children rapidly turning obese Parenting advice 'cuts child obesity' A fall of 6.4% may not seem much - but given obesity rates have remained stubbornly resistant to attempts to shift them, the efforts of Leeds are being widely praised. The data - compiled from the official school measuring programme - showed 8.8% of four- to five-year-olds in the city were recorded as obese in the past five years. That compared with 9.4% from 2009 to 2013. And that has been judged to be statistically significant by experts. But what has been particularly impressive is the fact that the biggest falls have been seen among the most deprived areas. Rates of obesity fell by nearly 9% in these neighbourhoods. Those involved in the Leeds project point to the work done with pre-school children. The city council developed a child-obesity strategy a decade ago that made this age group a key priority. Staff who work with pre-school children, including children's centres workers and health visitors, were trained to promote healthy eating. And parenting classes encouraged healthy snacking, eating as a family and the importance of cooking nutritious meals from scratch. The council has taken other steps too. There has been a big focus on getting children active through dance, while there has been an active local campaign to encourage families to reduce their sugar intake. The work with parents has been done in partnership with a charity called Henry, which runs programmes across the country. In Leeds parents have been offered eight-week courses. Henry chief executive Kim Roberts says they focus on some key messages. She says it is important to give children a choice. ""Offer them a choice of peas or carrots and let them decide,"" she adds. Parents are encouraged to set a good example by eating healthily too. One of those who has benefited is Belinda Mould and her daughter. The three-year-old used to only eat beans, sausages and mash potato, but now likes a range of fruits and vegetables from mangoes and strawberries to cucumber and sweetcorn. ""Her absolute favourite is broccoli. She can eat loads of it,"" Belinda says. While the progress has been impressive, Leeds has not seen a similar shift among older children. The school measuring programme also involves those at the end of primary school - 10- and 11-year-olds. And the obesity rates for this age group have remained stable. What is also true is that other places have also seen some small chinks of light in the battle against the bulge. Public Health England is working with areas including Luton, the London boroughs of Lewisham and Tower Hamlets and Stockton-on-Tees to see what can be learned. They have all seen some progress in reducing obesity rates - whether it is with older or younger kids. So what can we take from the experience of Leeds? Oxford University's Prof Susan Jebb, who has helped analyse the figures, says the key thing is that they give hope. ""It is sometimes too easy to think nothing is working, this shows something can be done,"" she says. ""What we need to do now is understand exactly why Leeds has seen the progress it has and also to look at the experience of other areas. ""They could hold the key to tackling child obesity"" School anti-obesity plans 'don't work' 'Stark increase' in overweight youngsters Los Angeles wildfires approach Hollywood sign, with Sunset Boulevard 'in ruins' What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

Man charged over bodies found in freezer,"Police found the women's remains at a flat in Vandome Close A man has been charged with preventing the lawful burial of two women whose bodies were found in a freezer. The pair's remains were found clothed and on top of each other at a flat in Vandome Close, Canning Town, east London, on Friday. Detectives have said it may take a week before the women are formally identified. Zahid Younis, 34, of Vandome Close, is due to appear at Wimbledon Magistrates' Court on Thursday, Scotland Yard said. He faces two counts of preventing the lawful and decent burial of a dead body. Speaking on Wednesday, Det Ch Insp Simon Harding said a chest freezer, measuring a few feet wide, had been removed from the crime scene. Work to identify the women was ongoing, he said, and post-mortem examinations would be carried out on Friday. There are fears for Mary-Jane Mustafa, 37, who went missing last May. The Met has appealed for anyone who has visited the flat in the last year to contact them. A 50-year-old man arrested on suspicion of murder has been released under investigation.

"Fears over Clutha helicopter maintenanceA helicopter engineer with the aircraft operator wrote in a handover ""it is an accident waiting to happen"".Glasgow & West Scotland","A Bond Air Services engineer shared concerns about the firm's helicopter maintenance in a handover the day before the crash An engineer described the level of maintenance carried out on helicopters in Glasgow as ""an accident waiting to happen"", the Clutha helicopter crash inquiry has heard. Paul Booth wrote his concerns in a shift handover to management. He was a licensed helicopter engineer with Bond Air Services, the operators of the aircraft which crashed into Glasgow's Clutha pub in November 2013. An inquiry heard he wrote his remarks the day before the crash. Mr Booth's handover read: ""I am extremely concerned at the way we are having to carry out in depth maintenance on our aircraft at Glasgow. ""It is an accident waiting to happen."" Mr Booth said he had written this at the end of a busy shift and had not expected anything like the Glasgow crash to happen. On Wednesday the inquiry heard that a pilot had reported fuel fluctuations in the aircraft to Mr Booth in the days before the crash. Mr Booth said he did not have time to change the fuel probe that week and put it in a handover to management at Bond. He said he wanted his managers to know how he felt at the end of a busy shift. He said he got no response. Mr Booth said he would stay on after his shift as he went above and beyond but had said sometimes when he came off his shift he was absolutely shattered. The incident with the fuel probe was reported on 24 November 2013 but was not entered into the defects log. If it had, according to the manual, it would have to have been replaced by 27 November. By the time of the crash on 29 November, the part had still not been replaced. Clutha pilot had previous fuel warning light 'No evidence' of helicopter fuel contamination Lack of crash evidence 'frustrating' Inquiry told how victims died Pilot given five low fuel warnings Helicopter 'spluttered' before crashing on pub The inquiry has previously heard evidence from police observer PC Alan Graham, who had flown with the Clutha crash pilot David Traill. PC Graham said he had been in a police helicopter with Mr Traill when ared fuel warning light came on.PC Graham said Captain Traill acknowledged the warning and seemed ""happy with his fuel calculations"" - he also described him as ""very competent"". PC Alan McLaren, 45, earlier told the inquiry he agreed that Captain Traill was ""a stickler for procedure"". Air traffic controller Andrew Campbell has also given evidence - he said Air Traffic Control at Glasgow Airport had no concerns about the flight. In April the inquiry heard that the aircraftdid not have a flight recorder, which meant there was no data about when fuel warnings came on and the length of time they stayed on. (Top: L to R) David Traill, PC Kirsty Nelis, PC Tony Collins, Gary Arthur, Samuel McGhee (Bottom: L to R) Colin Gibson, Robert Jenkins, Mark O'Prey, John McGarrigle, Joe Cusker The inquiry began with aminute's silenceto honour the victims of the 2013 tragedy.

Cheese allergy death pupil 'meant no harm',"The boy told the inquest he did not know how serious allergies could be A boy who flicked a piece of cheese at a teenager with a dairy allergy who later died did not mean to harm him, an inquest has heard. Karanbir Cheema, 13, who also had other allergies and asthma, suffered from a severe reaction at his school in west London on 28 June 2017. He was taken to hospital in a life-threatening condition and died two weeks later. An inquest into Karanbir's death heard a piece of cheese landed on his neck. A boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, told Poplar Coroner's Court he did not know why he threw the cheese, describing it as ""immature behaviour."" The court heard he was given it by a friend during break time at William Perkin Church of England High School in Ealing. He then threw the piece of cheese at Karanbir - but said he was not specifically his target. ""After that he just said 'I am allergic to cheese',"" the boy said. ""I apologised and went to class after."" The boy admitted he did not know how serious allergies could be and thought they could simply cause a rash or fever. ""I didn't mean to hurt him and obviously I feel bad now"", the boy said. In a statement, Karanbir's mother Rina said her son was ""extremely diligent"" at managing his allergies. Informed that cheese had been put down his neck, she said a consultant at the hospital questioned this because contact through the skin would not cause such a bad reaction. Giving evidence, Rajvnder Saini who worked at the school, said an Epipen kept in the school for Karanbir had expired in July 2016. An email was sent to the boy's mother in February 2017 to inform her, the court heard. The inquest continues.

Blood scandal teens' pact to reveal killer,"Stephen Nicholls told the inquiry he was at school when his friends with haemophilia started to die A group of teenagers with haemophilia who were infected by contaminated blood made a pact that whoever survived would find out what was killing them, a public inquiry has heard. Stephen Nicholls, now 52, said he is the only one of his friends left alive and he thinks about that ""every day"". Thousands of people were infected with hepatitis C and HIV from contaminated blood in the 1970s and '80s. Victims are telling a public inquiry how their lives have been ruined. Prime Minister Theresa May said the public inquiry into the contaminated blood scandal ""should have taken place earlier"". Blood inquiry seeks answers at last Lives have been ruined - contaminated blood victims 'Blood scandal killed both my husbands' Martin's story - 'How infected blood products gave me HIV' Mr Nicholls was diagnosed with haemophilia when he was one. At the age of eight, in 1976, he started attending Treloar's school for children with disabilities, in Hampshire. He was one of 89 boys at the school with haemophilia, who were offered treatment onsite. But, the inquiry heard, only 16 were alive today and, among his group of friends, Mr Nicholls was the only survivor. He said: ""It was my last year at a school when the first haemophiliacs were starting to die - and everyone was really scared. ""We realised that 'this is really serious' and 'this is killing us' or 'killing haemophiliacs'. ""There were four or five of us in a room and we said, 'This is going to happen to us, we can see it.' ""We said, 'Right, we've stuck together right through our childhood. If it happens and it kicks off, we're going to rely on the person still alive to pursue it and find out why and what went wrong.' ""I'm the only one left. That's tough. I think about that every day."" Mr Nicholls, from Surrey, said: ""We're a tough bunch. ""We ate together, we learned together, we were treated together. We became like brothers. ""To see your friends dying one by one, it's always in the back of your mind, 'I could be next.'"" Mr Nicholls was diagnosed with hepatitis C in 1991. As part of the inquiry, the treatment given to pupils at the school is being investigated to see if they were given contaminated blood products.

He was not - but should have been - referred to the Parole Board before he was released from prison in February, while halfway through serving a sentence for burglary. The Ministry of Justice said an ""urgent review"" of the case was under way. McCann was jailed in 2008 for aggravated burglary after admitting breaking into the home of an 85-year-old man. Joseph McCann is known to use false names, most recently Joel, the Met said He was given an Indeterminate Sentence for Public Protection (IPP) with a minimum term, or tariff, of two-and-a-half years. This meant the Parole Board had to decide if it was safe to release him once his tariff expired in 2010. In 2017 he was released on licence, which meant he could be sent back to jail if he reoffended or breached his parole conditions. Later that year, while on licence, McCann was arrested and charged with a further burglary. He was given a three-year jail sentence. McCann's case should have been referred to the board before he was released but in February this year he was dealt with as a ""determinate sentence"" prisoner. This meant he was automatically released 18 months into his sentence. Police previously released a CCTV image of the attacker A Â£20,000 reward has been offered by the Metropolitan Police for information about McCann's whereabouts that leads to his arrest and prosecution. Detectives described McCann as ""extremely dangerous"" and said people should call 999 if they saw him. He is described as white, with a muscular build, a bald head or shaved blond hair, a light-coloured short beard, and the name ""Bobbie"" tattooed on his stomach.

Julian Assange jailed over bail breach,"Julian Assange pumped his fist at photographers as he arrived at Southwark Crown Court ahead of the hearing Wikileaks co-founder Julian Assange has been sentenced to 50 weeks in jail for breaching his bail conditions. The 47-year-old was found guilty of breaching the Bail Act last month after his arrest at the Ecuadorian Embassy. He took refuge in the London embassy in 2012 to avoid extradition to Sweden over sexual assault allegations, which he has denied. In a letter read to the court, Assange said he had found himself ""struggling with difficult circumstances"". He apologised to those who ""consider I've disrespected them"", a packed Southwark Crown Court heard. ""I did what I thought at the time was the best or perhaps the only thing that I could have done,"" he said. In mitigation, Mark Summers QC said his client was ""gripped"" by fears of rendition to the US over the years because of his work with whistle-blowing website Wikileaks. ""As threats rained down on him from America, they overshadowed everything,"" he said. Profile: Julian Assange Timeline: Julian Assange saga How likely is an Assange conviction in US? Sentencing him, Judge Deborah Taylor told Assange it was difficult to envisage a more serious example of the offence. ""By hiding in the embassy you deliberately put yourself out of reach, while remaining in the UK,"" she said. She said this had ""undoubtedly"" affected the progress of the Swedish proceedings. His continued residence at the embassy and bringing him to justice had cost taxpayers Â£16m, she added. ""Whilst you may have had fears as to what may happen to you, nonetheless you had a choice, and the course of action you chose was to commit this offence,"" she concluded. As Assange was taken down to the cells, he raised a fist in defiance to his supporters in the public gallery behind him. They raised their fists in solidarity and directed shouts of ""shame on you"" towards the court. Speaking outside court, Wikileaks editor-in-chief Kristinn Hrafnsson said the sentence was an ""outrage"". The extradition process was now the ""big fight"" and would be ""a question of life and death"" for Assange, he said. ""It's also a question of life and death for a major journalist principle,"" he told reporters. I apologise unreservedly to those who consider that I have disrespected them by the way I have pursued my case. This is not what I wanted or intended. I found myself struggling with terrifying circumstances for which neither I nor those from whom I sought advice could work out any remedy. I did what I thought at the time was the best and perhaps the only thing that could be done - which I hoped might lead to a legal resolution being reached between Ecuador and Sweden that would protect me from the worst of my fears. I regret the course that this took; the difficulties were instead compounded and impacted upon very many others. Whilst the difficulties I now face may have become even greater, nevertheless it is right for me to say this now. Assange now faces US federal conspiracy charges related to one of the largest leaks of government secrets. The UK will decide whether to extradite Assange to the US in response to allegations that he conspired with former US intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning to download classified databases. He faces up to five years in a US prison if convicted. Wikileaks has published thousands of classified documents covering everything from the film industry to national security and war. By BBC correspondent Andy Moore, at Southwark Crown Court As Julian Assange arrived at court from Belmarsh High Security prison, photographers got a picture of him defiantly pumping his fist. He's still got a beard but it's been trimmed - it's not the white, bushy beard he was wearing when he was hauled out of the Ecuadorean Embassy last month. There's big international interest, and more than a dozen TV cameras outside. Journalists had to queue for two hours before the case opened to get a ticket to Court Number One, or to an overflow court where there was a videolink to the live proceedings. Supporters of Assange are outside court making their voices heard - one has been reading from her notes saying Assange is a political prisoner. This video can not be played Video footage shows Julian Assange being dragged from the Ecuadorian embassy Australian-born Assange was dramatically arrested by UK police on 11 April after Ecuador abruptly withdrew its asylum. At a court hearing that same day, he was remanded in custody and called a ""narcissist who cannot get beyond his own selfish interest"" by district judge Michael Snow. Days later, Swedish prosecutors said they were considering reopening the investigation into rape and sexual assault allegations against him. At the time, Assange said he had had entirely consensual sex with two women while on a trip to Stockholm to give a lecture. Prosecutors dropped the rape investigation in 2017 because they were unable to formally notify him of allegations while he was staying in the embassy. Two other charges of molestation and unlawful coercion had to be dropped in 2015 because time had run out. More than 70 UK MPs and peers have signed a letter urging Home Secretary Sajid Javid to ensure Assange faces authorities in Sweden if they want his extradition.

Toddler shot in head with crossbow bolt,"Merseyside Police said the girl remains in hospital with a serious head injury A two year-old girl has been shot in the head with a crossbow bolt at a house in Liverpool. The child was hurt at a home on Oakhouse Park in the Walton area of the city on Tuesday afternoon when a ""crossbow was discharged"", police said. The weapon involved has been seized and was being forensically examined, but no arrests have been made. The girl remains in hospital with a serious head injury, Merseyside Police added. Det Insp Sabi Kaur said: ""I am sure the community in Walton will share our shock and distress at the fact a child could have been hurt in this way.

Fracking boss calls government 'pathetic',"This video can not be played Ineos chief Jim Ratcliffe was speaking to the BBC's sports editor Dan Roan Britain's richest man has called the government's attitude to fracking for gas ""pathetic"", accusing ministers of listening to a vocal minority rather than looking at the science. Sir Jim Ratcliffe, whose firm Ineos is conducting exploratory fracking tests, said the north of England was sitting on potential huge energy resources. But restrictions were making it unviable for firms, he told the BBC. On Monday, the UK's shale gas tsar resigned after just six months. Natascha Engel, a former Labour MP, said fracking was being throttled by rules preventing mini earthquakes. Current government rules,externalmean fracking must be suspended every time a 0.5 magnitude tremor is detected. But Ms Engel said the cautious approach to tremors had created a de facto ban on fracking. Mr Ratcliffe said he agreed with Ms Engel's criticism. ""I think the government has been pathetic on the subject, frankly - honestly, I do,"" Mr Ratcliffe said. The government was listening to ""a very vocal, but a minuscule, minority of people, and I think there's a high degree of ignorance"". Fracking tsar resigns over 'ridiculous' rules What is fracking? Mr Ratcliffe, whose company is carrying out tests in Nottinghamshire and has exploration rights in Yorkshire and Cheshire, believes the UK could emulate the shale gas boom in the US. ""America today is self sufficient in oil and gas... and it is because of this new technology, which is extremely safe and well proven,"" he said. With the demise of huge swathes of manufacturing in the north of England, expansion of the fracking industry would be a big creator of jobs, he added. He told the BBC's sports editor Dan Roan: ""I feel really strongly that the northern economy is really important to the UK, and fracking has been so successful in America - it's transformed places like Pittsburgh. ""We've got towns in England which are not the happiest of places at the moment, so it makes me cross when people don't look at the science."" Ineos and Cuadrilla - which is already fracking for shale gas - have faced major protests from campaigners who say the process is environmentally unfriendly and causes earth tremors. Fracking, or hydraulic fracturing, involves pumping water, sand and chemicals into the ground at high pressure in order to split rock formations and release gas. A number of countries have banned the process, including France and Germany. The UK government defended its record on fracking against Mr Ratcliffe's criticism. A spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said the government supports the shale industry ""because we believe it could have the potential to be a new domestic energy source, and create thousands of well paid, quality jobs"". ""We've worked to develop world-leading regulations based on the advice of scientists and in consultation with industry. We are confident these strike the right balance in ensuring the industry can develop, while ensuring any operations are carried out safely and responsibly,"" the spokesperson said. Mr Ratcliffe has taken over cycling's Team Sky, and the renamed Team Ineos will compete in the Tour de Yorkshire on Thursday. There have been reports that environmental campaigners could protest along the route. The billionaire rejected criticism that his move into cycling was an attempt to ""greenwash"" Ineos. ""It's nothing to do with it at all,"" he said. ""The sport is totally different."" But Simon Bowers, of Friends of the Earth, said Ineos's ""highjacking"" of cycling was ""shameless"", adding: ""Ineos's plans for fracking are completely incompatible with fighting climate change. Fossil fuels have no place in sports sponsorship."" The pro-Brexit businessman also dismissed reports about him allegedly leaving the UK to live in Monaco. ""I don't live in Monaco, I can tell you that,"" he said. But is he thinking about a move? ""I don't really want to talk about where I live because that's my own private affair. But we have invested Â£2.5bn in the UK in the last 20 years... and I have never made a penny of profit in the UK. I'm many hundreds of millions short of getting that back. ""I have made lots of money in the US, Germany and Belgium, but am I supposed to go and live there? It's my private affair,"" he said.

Has Leeds cracked the obesity problem?The city is being lauded for success in reducing the waistlines of young children. Should others follow?,"Childhood obesity is a major problem. But now news has emerged that one city - Leeds - has been making some progress. Figures presented to the European Congress on Obesity suggest Leeds has managed to reduce the number of children who are extremely overweight. The data showed there had been a 6.4% fall in obesity rates over recent years. Record number of severely obese children World's children rapidly turning obese Parenting advice 'cuts child obesity' A fall of 6.4% may not seem much - but given obesity rates have remained stubbornly resistant to attempts to shift them, the efforts of Leeds are being widely praised. The data - compiled from the official school measuring programme - showed 8.8% of four- to five-year-olds in the city were recorded as obese in the past five years. That compared with 9.4% from 2009 to 2013. And that has been judged to be statistically significant by experts. But what has been particularly impressive is the fact that the biggest falls have been seen among the most deprived areas. Rates of obesity fell by nearly 9% in these neighbourhoods. Those involved in the Leeds project point to the work done with pre-school children. The city council developed a child-obesity strategy a decade ago that made this age group a key priority. Staff who work with pre-school children, including children's centres workers and health visitors, were trained to promote healthy eating. And parenting classes encouraged healthy snacking, eating as a family and the importance of cooking nutritious meals from scratch. The council has taken other steps too. There has been a big focus on getting children active through dance, while there has been an active local campaign to encourage families to reduce their sugar intake. The work with parents has been done in partnership with a charity called Henry, which runs programmes across the country. In Leeds parents have been offered eight-week courses. Henry chief executive Kim Roberts says they focus on some key messages. She says it is important to give children a choice. ""Offer them a choice of peas or carrots and let them decide,"" she adds. Parents are encouraged to set a good example by eating healthily too. One of those who has benefited is Belinda Mould and her daughter. The three-year-old used to only eat beans, sausages and mash potato, but now likes a range of fruits and vegetables from mangoes and strawberries to cucumber and sweetcorn. ""Her absolute favourite is broccoli. She can eat loads of it,"" Belinda says. While the progress has been impressive, Leeds has not seen a similar shift among older children. The school measuring programme also involves those at the end of primary school - 10- and 11-year-olds. And the obesity rates for this age group have remained stable. What is also true is that other places have also seen some small chinks of light in the battle against the bulge. Public Health England is working with areas including Luton, the London boroughs of Lewisham and Tower Hamlets and Stockton-on-Tees to see what can be learned. They have all seen some progress in reducing obesity rates - whether it is with older or younger kids. So what can we take from the experience of Leeds? Oxford University's Prof Susan Jebb, who has helped analyse the figures, says the key thing is that they give hope. ""It is sometimes too easy to think nothing is working, this shows something can be done,"" she says. ""What we need to do now is understand exactly why Leeds has seen the progress it has and also to look at the experience of other areas. ""They could hold the key to tackling child obesity"" School anti-obesity plans 'don't work' 'Stark increase' in overweight youngsters Los Angeles wildfires approach Hollywood sign, with Sunset Boulevard 'in ruins' What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

His departure follows an inquiry into a leak from a top-level National Security Council meeting, over a plan to allow Huawei limited access to help build the UK's new 5G network. He has been replaced by Penny Mordaunt, who will become the UK's first female defence secretary. Mr Williamson has ""strenuously"" denied leaking information from the meeting, but the PM said ""no other credible version of events"" has been found to explain the leak. Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson and Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable have both said they think the police should get involved in the matter. But Scotland Yard said in a statement that it was a matter for the National Security Council and the Cabinet Office, and it was not carrying out an investigation. BBC News Channel Gavin
Williamsonâs denial over being behind the leak from a top-level National
Security Council meeting is âextraordinaryâ, a security think tank says. Prof Michael Clarke, from the Royal United Services Institute, says
Mr Williamson has implied that the investigation was ânot formal or thoroughâ
which is a direct criticism of those who conducted the inquiry. He adds: âGavin Williamson is going down fighting
and heâs maintaining, in effect, that theyâve got the wrong man. âThatâs extraordinary â for a senior minister to be in that
position.â BBC News Channel Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable says Gavin Williamson's sacking is ""absolutely extraordinary"". He says he agrees with Labour deputy leader Tom Watson that ""this is clearly a police matter"". ""The Metropolitan Police are going to have to get involved as quickly as possible"".

Laura KuenssbergBBC political editor Downing Street has made a very serious accusation and is sure enough to carry out this sacking. For the prime minister's allies, it will show that she is, despite the political turmoil, still strong enough to move some of her ministers around - to hire and fire. Mr Williamson is strenuously still denying that the leak was anything to do with him at all. There is nothing fond, or anything conciliatory, in either the letter from the prime minister to him, or his reply back to her. Read more here. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt says the prime minister had no alternative but to sack Gavin Williamson as defence secretary. Speaking as he arrived in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, Mr Hunt said: ""On a personal level I'm very sorry about what happened for Gavin's sake but given the gravity of the situation there was no other alternative outcome."" Labourâs deputy leader Tom Watson has called for a police inquiry to investigate whether or not Gavin Williamson breached the Official Secrets Act. âItâs the most brutal sacking letter of any minister Iâve seen in my lifetimeâ he said. âThe magnitude of the allegation against him is very serious.â He said that it was a crime to breach the Official Secrets Act, but acknowledged that Mr Williamson strenuously denies the allegation. âHe denies it â he deserves to have his voice heard.â The way to do that is to hold a âcriminal inquiryâ he added, which he said he believed should âgo ahead rapidly.â The new international development secretary tweets...

""At this time, we're not carrying out an investigation. ""Clearly if at any stage we receive any information that would suggest criminal offences have been committed, then we will look into that."" Penny Mordaunt's appointment as the new defence secretary follows a term serving as the International Development Secretary. Ms Mordant has a background as a naval reservist and previously served as the armed forces minister under David Cameron.

She campaigned for a Leave vote in the 2016 EU referendum. Downing Street has played down talk of a possible prosecution over the leak from a top-level National Security Council meeting. Theresa May's official spokesman told a Westminster briefing: ""It is not for the government to determine prosecutions, but the prime minister has said, from her point of view, that she considers the matter to be closed.""

Has Leeds cracked the obesity problem?The city is being lauded for success in reducing the waistlines of young children. Should others follow?Health,"Childhood obesity is a major problem. But now news has emerged that one city - Leeds - has been making some progress. Figures presented to the European Congress on Obesity suggest Leeds has managed to reduce the number of children who are extremely overweight. The data showed there had been a 6.4% fall in obesity rates over recent years. Record number of severely obese children World's children rapidly turning obese Parenting advice 'cuts child obesity' A fall of 6.4% may not seem much - but given obesity rates have remained stubbornly resistant to attempts to shift them, the efforts of Leeds are being widely praised. The data - compiled from the official school measuring programme - showed 8.8% of four- to five-year-olds in the city were recorded as obese in the past five years. That compared with 9.4% from 2009 to 2013. And that has been judged to be statistically significant by experts. But what has been particularly impressive is the fact that the biggest falls have been seen among the most deprived areas. Rates of obesity fell by nearly 9% in these neighbourhoods. Those involved in the Leeds project point to the work done with pre-school children. The city council developed a child-obesity strategy a decade ago that made this age group a key priority. Staff who work with pre-school children, including children's centres workers and health visitors, were trained to promote healthy eating. And parenting classes encouraged healthy snacking, eating as a family and the importance of cooking nutritious meals from scratch. The council has taken other steps too. There has been a big focus on getting children active through dance, while there has been an active local campaign to encourage families to reduce their sugar intake. The work with parents has been done in partnership with a charity called Henry, which runs programmes across the country. In Leeds parents have been offered eight-week courses. Henry chief executive Kim Roberts says they focus on some key messages. She says it is important to give children a choice. ""Offer them a choice of peas or carrots and let them decide,"" she adds. Parents are encouraged to set a good example by eating healthily too. One of those who has benefited is Belinda Mould and her daughter. The three-year-old used to only eat beans, sausages and mash potato, but now likes a range of fruits and vegetables from mangoes and strawberries to cucumber and sweetcorn. ""Her absolute favourite is broccoli. She can eat loads of it,"" Belinda says. While the progress has been impressive, Leeds has not seen a similar shift among older children. The school measuring programme also involves those at the end of primary school - 10- and 11-year-olds. And the obesity rates for this age group have remained stable. What is also true is that other places have also seen some small chinks of light in the battle against the bulge. Public Health England is working with areas including Luton, the London boroughs of Lewisham and Tower Hamlets and Stockton-on-Tees to see what can be learned. They have all seen some progress in reducing obesity rates - whether it is with older or younger kids. So what can we take from the experience of Leeds? Oxford University's Prof Susan Jebb, who has helped analyse the figures, says the key thing is that they give hope. ""It is sometimes too easy to think nothing is working, this shows something can be done,"" she says. ""What we need to do now is understand exactly why Leeds has seen the progress it has and also to look at the experience of other areas.

Council elections: What you need to know,"The elections for Northern Ireland's 11 councils are being held on Thursday - these are some of the things you need to know. A total of 819 candidates are standing for election to 462 seats. There are 1,463 polling stations, opening at 07:00 BST and closing at 22:00. If you are unsure where your nearest polling station is, there is an easy search facility on theElectoral Office website,external. Virtual reality helps demystify voting for disabled people Anyone in a queue at a polling station at 22:00 will still be able to vote. The local council election is an single transferable vote (STV) election. Belfast City Council has 60 councillors; Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council and Newry, Mourne and Down District Councils have 41. The remaining eight councils have 40. Voters must not take photos inside the polling station. The polling card received through the post is for information purposes only, but you will need photo ID. A UK, Irish or EEA driving licence (photographic part; provisional accepted) A UK, Irish or EU passport An Electoral Identity Card A Translink Senior SmartPass A Translink 60+ SmartPass A Translink War Disabled SmartPass A Translink Blind Person's SmartPass The ID document does not need to be current but the photograph must be a good enough likeness to allow polling station staff to confirm your identity. Children under 18 may accompany voters to the polling station but staff can limit the number of under 18s if voting is being impeded. If you need assistance, you should ask a member of polling staff. Counting begins at 08:00 on Friday and it is hoped most counts will be completed on Friday - the remainder should be completed on Saturday. Councils are divided up into a number of district electoral areas (DEAs) Each DEA is represented by a number of councillors - usually between five and seven Under STV, voters rank candidates in order of preference by marking 1, 2, 3 and so on next to the names of candidates on a ballot paper A voter can rank as many or as few candidates as they like or just vote for one candidate Each candidate needs a minimum number of votes to be elected. This number is calculated according to the number of seats and votes cast and is called a quota. The first preference votes for each candidate are added up and any candidate who has achieved this quota is elected If a candidate has more votes than are needed to fill the quota, that candidate's surplus votes are transferred to the remaining candidates. Votes that would have gone to the winner instead go to the second preference listed on those ballot papers If candidates do not meet the quota, the candidate with the fewest first preference votes is eliminated and the second preference votes are transferred to other candidates. These processes are repeated until all the seats are filled Virtual polling station wins the vote Los Angeles wildfires approach Hollywood sign, with Sunset Boulevard 'in ruins' What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

Primitive humans lived at high altitudes,"The Xiahe mandible was found in 1980 in Baishiya Karst Cave Scientists have found evidence that an ancient species of human called Denisovans lived at high altitudes in Tibet. The ability to survive in such extreme environments had previously been associated only with our species -Homo sapiens. The ancient ancestor seems to have passed on a gene that helps modern people cope at high elevations. Details of the study arepublished in the journal Nature,external. The Denisovans were a mysterious human species living in Asia before modern humans like us expanded across the world tens of thousands of years ago. Until recently, the only fossils came from a few fragments of bone and teeth from a single site in Siberia - Denisova Cave. But DNA had shown that they were a distinct branch of the human family. Now, scientists have identified the first Denisovan fossil from another site. It's a mandible (lower jawbone) discovered in 1980 at Baishiya Karst Cave, 3,280m up on the Tibetan Plateau. A technique called uranium-series dating was used on carbonate deposits on the bone. This yielded a date of 160,000 years ago for the mandible. Co-author Jean Jacques Hublin, from the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, said finding evidence of an ancient - or archaic - species of human living at such high elevations was a surprise. ""When we deal with 'archaic hominins' - Neanderthals, Denisovans, early forms ofHomo sapiens- it's clear that these hominins were limited in their capabilities to dwell in extreme environments. ""If you look at the situation in Europe, we have a lot of Neanderthal sites and people have been studying these sites for a century-and-a-half now. ""The highest sites we have are at 2,000m altitude. There are not many, and they are clearly sites where these Neanderthals used to go in summer, probably for special hunts. But otherwise, we don't have these types of sites."" An autumn view of Jiangla River Valley, where Baishiya Karst Cave is located Of the Denisovans on the Tibetan Plateau, he said: ""It's a plateau... and there are obviously enough resources for people to live there and not just come occasionally."" While the researchers could not find any traces of DNA preserved in this fossil, they managed to extract proteins from one of the molars, which they then analysed applying something called ancient protein analysis. ""Our protein analysis shows that the Xiahe mandible belonged to a hominin population that was closely related to the Denisovans from Denisova Cave,"" said co-author Frido Welker, from the University of Copenhagen, Denmark. The discovery may explain why individuals studied at Denisova Cave had a gene variant known to protect against hypoxia (oxygen deficiency) at high altitudes. This had been a puzzle because the Siberian cave is located just 700m above sea level. Present-day Sherpas, Tibetans and neighbouring populations have the same gene variant, which was probably acquired whenHomo sapiensmixed with the Denisovans thousands of years ago. In fact, the gene variant appears to have undergone positive natural selection (which can result in mutations reaching high frequencies in populations because they confer an advantage). ""We can only speculate that living in this kind of environment, any mutation that was favourable to breathing an atmosphere impoverished in oxygen would be retained by natural selection,"" said Prof Hublin. ""And it's a rather likely scenario to explain how this mutation made its way to present-day Tibetans.""

Fears over Clutha helicopter maintenance,"A Bond Air Services engineer shared concerns about the firm's helicopter maintenance in a handover the day before the crash An engineer described the level of maintenance carried out on helicopters in Glasgow as ""an accident waiting to happen"", the Clutha helicopter crash inquiry has heard. Paul Booth wrote his concerns in a shift handover to management. He was a licensed helicopter engineer with Bond Air Services, the operators of the aircraft which crashed into Glasgow's Clutha pub in November 2013. An inquiry heard he wrote his remarks the day before the crash. Mr Booth's handover read: ""I am extremely concerned at the way we are having to carry out in depth maintenance on our aircraft at Glasgow. ""It is an accident waiting to happen."" Mr Booth said he had written this at the end of a busy shift and had not expected anything like the Glasgow crash to happen. On Wednesday the inquiry heard that a pilot had reported fuel fluctuations in the aircraft to Mr Booth in the days before the crash. Mr Booth said he did not have time to change the fuel probe that week and put it in a handover to management at Bond. He said he wanted his managers to know how he felt at the end of a busy shift. He said he got no response. Mr Booth said he would stay on after his shift as he went above and beyond but had said sometimes when he came off his shift he was absolutely shattered. The incident with the fuel probe was reported on 24 November 2013 but was not entered into the defects log. If it had, according to the manual, it would have to have been replaced by 27 November. By the time of the crash on 29 November, the part had still not been replaced. Clutha pilot had previous fuel warning light 'No evidence' of helicopter fuel contamination Lack of crash evidence 'frustrating' Inquiry told how victims died Pilot given five low fuel warnings Helicopter 'spluttered' before crashing on pub The inquiry has previously heard evidence from police observer PC Alan Graham, who had flown with the Clutha crash pilot David Traill. PC Graham said he had been in a police helicopter with Mr Traill when ared fuel warning light came on.PC Graham said Captain Traill acknowledged the warning and seemed ""happy with his fuel calculations"" - he also described him as ""very competent"". PC Alan McLaren, 45, earlier told the inquiry he agreed that Captain Traill was ""a stickler for procedure"". Air traffic controller Andrew Campbell has also given evidence - he said Air Traffic Control at Glasgow Airport had no concerns about the flight. In April the inquiry heard that the aircraftdid not have a flight recorder, which meant there was no data about when fuel warnings came on and the length of time they stayed on. (Top: L to R) David Traill, PC Kirsty Nelis, PC Tony Collins, Gary Arthur, Samuel McGhee (Bottom: L to R) Colin Gibson, Robert Jenkins, Mark O'Prey, John McGarrigle, Joe Cusker The inquiry began with aminute's silenceto honour the victims of the 2013 tragedy. On the third day, a joint minute was read out whichagreed the times and causes of death. Pilot David Traill, 51; PC Tony Collins, 43; and PC Kirsty Nelis, 36, lost their lives in the crash along with seven customers who were in the bar on Stockwell Street. They were Gary Arthur, 48; Joe Cusker, 59; Colin Gibson, 33; Robert Jenkins, 61; John McGarrigle, 58; Samuel McGhee, 56; and Mark O'Prey, 44.

UKIP 'not safety valve for Tories' - Batten,"This video can not be played UKIP European election launch: Gerard Batten in Middlesbrough Gerard Batten has dismissed Nigel Farage's Brexit Party as a ""Tory-lite"" ego trip as he insisted only UKIP has a ""clear policy"" for leaving the EU. Launching its European election campaign in Middlesbrough, the UKIP leader said democracy was under threat if the Brexit vote was not honoured. UKIP was a ""real political party"" with members and a rule book, he said. Its rival, he said, was a ""wholly owned subsidiary of one man's ego"" and a ""safety valve for disaffected Tories"". Mr Farage, UKIP's figurehead for two decades, quit the party after a bitter fallout with Mr Batten last year. The two parties are now competing against each other in elections to the European Parliament on 23 May. UKIP won the most votes and seats of any UK party when the polls were last held in 2014 but has been consumed by internal rows since then. A guide to the UK's European elections Nigel Farage launches Brexit Party Mr Batten told activists EU membership had been a ""cancer at the heart"" of British life for more than 40 years, with the transfer of law-making powers ""rotting the soul"" of the country. He said Theresa May ""never had any intention"" of delivering on the 2016 Brexit vote and had made the UK a ""laughing stock"". He promised to campaign across England and Wales to get UKIP candidates elected on a policy of ""unconditional and unilateral"" withdrawal from the EU. The UK should leave without a deal and offer to trade with the EU on a tariff-free basis, or under World Trade Organisation rules, with reciprocal rights for each other's citizens. Launching a strong personal attack on Mr Farage, he suggested the Brexit Party was a ""safety valve for disaffected Conservatives"". ""UKIP is a real political party, that has a constitution, a governing body and a rule book,"" he said. ""It has members with rights who elect a leader. ""The Brexit Party has no members or structure. It is an autocracy. UKIP has policies and a manifesto. The Brexit Party does not. ""UKIP is a party of ordinary people from all social classes and backgrounds. The Brexit Party is an alternative Tory Party. It is Tory-lite. ""Their light blue colours tell you everything you need to know about it."" Only three of the 24 UKIP MEPs elected in 2014 have been selected to represent the party again, with the majority having since left the party. Mr Batten has been criticised for selecting and then defending Carl Benjamin, a candidate in the South West of England who posted a message on Twitter in 2016 saying he ""would not even rape"" the Labour MP Jess Phillips. He has described the comments as ""satire"" and said they should be seen in the context of Mr Benjamin's self-appointed stance as a freedom of speech campaigner.

By-election as disgraced MP ousted,"Fiona Onasanya was expelled by the Labour Party after her conviction Disgraced Fiona Onasanya has become the first MP to be removed by a recall petition. Ms Onasanya, 35, was jailed in January for lying about a speeding offence. She was expelled by Labour after her conviction and had been representing Peterborough as an independent. Peterborough City Council said 19,261 constituents had signed the petition. Ms Onasanya will be allowed to stand for re-election. The council said the signatures represented 27.6% of eligible residents. The threshold required to remove Ms Onasanya was 10%. Commons Speaker John Bercow confirmed the recall petition had been successful. He told MPs: ""Fiona Onasanya is no longer the member for Peterborough and the seat is accordingly vacant. ""She can therefore no longer participate in any parliamentary proceedings as a member of parliament."" Ms Onasanya, who was jailed for perverting the course of justice, has become the first MP to be removed by the recall process, introduced by David Cameron in 2015. She was first elected to Parliament as a Labour MP with a slender majority of 607 in 2017. The process by which the electorate can remove an MP before the end of their term was introduced in the UK in 2015 in response to the 2010 MPs' expenses scandal. The recall procedure can only be triggered under certain circumstances, including if an MP is convicted in the UK of an offence and sentenced or ordered to be imprisoned or detained - and all appeals have been exhausted. For a recall petition to be successful, 10% of eligible registered voters need to sign the petition. It remains open for six weeks. If successful, a by-election is called and the recalled MP is allowed to stand as a candidate. The first recall petition against an MP was triggered in July 2018 against North Antrim MP Ian Paisley after he failed to declare two holidays paid for by the Sri Lankan government. The petition was unsuccessful, as it was short of 444 signatures, and Mr Paisley remained an MP. The petition against Ms Onasanya is the first time a recall petition has been held in England. A third MP, Chris Davies, Conservative member for Brecon and Radnorshire,is facing a recall petitionin Wales after he was convicted for a false expenses claim. Source:UK Parliament,external Labour Party chairman Ian Lavery said: ""Labour campaigned hard for a victory in this recall petition. ""Labour will vigorously fight the by-election here in Peterborough."" Nigel Farage said his new Brexit Party would contest the by-election, but a spokesman said no decision had yet been taken on whether Mr Farage would be the candidate. The by-election in a city which voted 61% Leave in the 2016 EU referendum potentially offers the former UKIP leader a route to a seat in Parliament after seven unsuccessful attempts. Meanwhile, the former MP George Galloway - a Brexiteer - also declared on Twitter hisintention to stand in the by-election.,external Conservative parliamentary candidate for Peterborough Paul Bristow said: ""The people of Peterborough deserve a better MP who will vote in Parliament to deliver Brexit."" Fiona Onasanya made her first and last speech in the Commons last week following her release from prison Hannah Olsson, political reporter, BBC Radio Cambridgeshire The by-election in Peterborough will come in the middle of one of the most tumultuous times in modern political history. Brexit has shaken up political alliances like never before, but we don't know what impact that will have, and who it will favour. The by-election could be an opportunity for the new parties to test the popularity of what they're offering, but the question is what party will they be taking voters from? Another possibility is that Brexit has made everyone so fed up with politics that people in Peterborough will just decide not to vote at all, and we will see a very low turnout.

Scientists find cocaine in shrimps,"Researchers collected freshwater shrimp from rivers in Suffolk Scientists found cocaine in freshwater shrimps when testing rivers for chemicals, a study said. Researchers at King's College London, in collaboration with the University of Suffolk, tested 15 different locations across Suffolk. Their report said cocaine was found in all samples tested. Other illicit drugs, such as ketamine, were also widespread in the shrimp. The researchers said it was a ""surprising"" finding. Professor Nic Bury, from the University of Suffolk, said: ""Whether the presence of cocaine in aquatic animals is an issue for Suffolk, or more widespread an occurrence in the UK and abroad, awaits further research. ""Environmental health has attracted much attention from the public due to challenges associated with climate change and microplastic pollution. ""However, the impact of 'invisible' chemical pollution (such as drugs) on wildlife health needs more focus in the UK."" Professor Nic Bury from the University of Suffolk was one of the researchers The study, published in Environment International, looked at the exposure of wildlife, such as the freshwater shrimp Gammarus pulex, to different micropollutants. Researchers collected the samples from the rivers Alde, Box, Deben, Gipping and Waveney. They said in addition to the drugs, banned pesticides and pharmaceuticals were also widespread in the shrimp that were collected. The potential for any effect on the creatures was ""likely to be low"", they said. Scientists collected samples from 15 sites in Suffolk, including River Alde Dr Leon Barron, from King's College London, said: ""Such regular occurrence of illicit drugs in wildlife was surprising. ""We might expect to see these in urban areas such as London, but not in smaller and more rural catchments. ""The presence of pesticides which have long been banned in the UK also poses a particular challenge as the sources of these remain unclear.""

Scouts delivered Tory election leaflets,"The leaflets contained information on Conservative candidates Daniel McNally and Paul Rickett for the East Lindsey District Council elections A scout leader has resigned after getting children in his troop to deliver election leaflets on behalf of two Tory council candidates. The group leader and other volunteers in Lincolnshire, quit after a complaint was made, the Scout Association said. According to theGrimsby Telegraph,external, the scouts were used by Daniel McNally and Paul Rickett in return for a year's use of allotment space to grow vegetables. Mr Rickett said it was ""nothing more than an innocent decision on my part"". The newspaper reported Matt Whall, leader of the Marshchapel scout group, near Grimsby, had apologised in a message posted on the village's Facebook page, saying he had not done it for financial gain but had ""hoped to run a soup kitchen for the community using veg grown in the village"". ""I did not ask the scouts to distribute leaflets for political gain or promotion but did something purely with the motive to provide an enriching opportunity for the young people in the group,"" he added. Mr Rickett, a candidate in the East Lindsey District Council election, said: ""It is regrettable that, what was, in reality, local community minded people trying to help each other out, has taken on a political dimension. ""This was never my intention. Asking the scouts to help me leaflet around Marshchapel for me was nothing more that an innocent decision on my part."" The Scout Association said it was ""clear this was a genuine error"" and the leader's resignation prompted other group leaders to quit, but did not disclose how many had left. ""Members of the movement in uniform, or individuals when acting as representatives of the movement, must not take part in any party political meetings or activities that endorse any particular political party or candidate,"" a spokesman said. Quiz: How well do you know the local elections? Councillors get panic alarms amid threats What happens when councils change hands? The Marshchapel scout group would continue to operate and volunteers were working to ""minimise the impact to the young people"" in the club, the spokesman added. Mr McNally and the Conservative Party have been approached for a comment. The candidates standing for election to East Lindsey District Council in the Marshchapel & Somercotes ward on Thursday 2 May are: Sandra Dykes - Independent; Trisha Newman - Labour Party; Daniel McNally - Conservative Party; Paul Rickett - Conservative Party.

The 62-year-old, who has changed his name to John Radford, was charged on 1 May with two counts of administering a substance with intent. He was also charged with two counts of administering a stupefying or overpowering drug with intent. Each of the four charges relate to four separate individuals between 2000 and 2008 in London, the Met said. The force added that the allegations were made in early 2018.

Rape suspect jail release 'error' inquiry,"Joseph McCann, 34, is said to have links to Watford, Aylesbury and Ipswich A suspected triple rapist being hunted by police may have been mistakenly released from prison, it has emerged. Joseph McCann, 34, is alleged to haveabducted and raped three women in north London and Watfordlast week. He was not - but should have been - referred to the Parole Board before he was released from prison in February, while halfway through serving a sentence for burglary. The Ministry of Justice said an ""urgent review"" of the case was under way. McCann was jailed in 2008 for aggravated burglary after admitting breaking into the home of an 85-year-old man. Joseph McCann is known to use false names, most recently Joel, the Met said He was given an Indeterminate Sentence for Public Protection (IPP) with a minimum term, or tariff, of two-and-a-half years. This meant the Parole Board had to decide if it was safe to release him once his tariff expired in 2010. In 2017 he was released on licence, which meant he could be sent back to jail if he reoffended or breached his parole conditions. Later that year, while on licence, McCann was arrested and charged with a further burglary. He was given a three-year jail sentence. McCann's case should have been referred to the board before he was released but in February this year he was dealt with as a ""determinate sentence"" prisoner. This meant he was automatically released 18 months into his sentence. Police previously released a CCTV image of the attacker A Â£20,000 reward has been offered by the Metropolitan Police for information about McCann's whereabouts that leads to his arrest and prosecution. Detectives described McCann as ""extremely dangerous"" and said people should call 999 if they saw him. He is described as white, with a muscular build, a bald head or shaved blond hair, a light-coloured short beard, and the name ""Bobbie"" tattooed on his stomach.

Huawei- The world's most controversial company," The African Union headquarters in Addis Ababa is a shiny spaceship-like structure that glistens in the afternoon sun. With its accompanying skyscraper, it stands out in the Ethiopian capital. Greetings in Mandarin welcome visitors as they enter the lifts, and the plastic palm trees bear the logos of the China Development Bank. African Union HQ, Addis Ababa Everywhere, there are small indications that the building was made possible through Chinese financial aid. In 2006, Beijing pledged $200m to build the headquarters. Completed in 2012, everything was custom-built by the Chinese - including a state-of-the-art computer system. For several years, the building stood as a proud testament to ever-closer ties between China and Africa. Trade has rocketed over the past two decades, growing by about 20% a year, according to international consultancy McKinsey. China is Africa’s largest economic partner. But in January 2018, French newspaper Le Monde Afrique dropped a bombshell. It reported that the AU’s computer system had been compromised. The newspaper, citing multiple sources, said that for five years, between the hours of midnight and 0200, data from the AU’s servers was transferred more than 8,000km away - to servers in Shanghai. This had allegedly continued for 1,825 days in a row. Le Monde Afrique reported that it had come to light in 2017, when a conscientious scientist working for the AU recorded an unusually high amount of computer activity on its servers during hours when the offices would have been deserted. It was also reported that microphones and listening devices had been discovered in the walls and desks of the building, following a sweep for bugs. The reaction was swift. Both AU and Chinese officials publicly condemned the report as false and sensationalist - an attempt by the Western media to damage relations between a more assertive China and an increasingly independent Africa. But Le Monde Afrique said that AU officials had privately expressed concerns about just how dependent they were on Chinese aid - and what the consequences of that could be. In the midst of all of this, one fact remained largely unreported. The main supplier of information and communication technology systems to the AU headquarters was China’s best-known telecoms equipment company - Huawei. “This doesn’t mean the company was complicit in any theft of data,” said Danielle Cave of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, in a review of the alleged incident. “But… it’s hard to see how - given Huawei’s role in providing equipment and key ICT services to the AU building and specifically to the AU’s data centre - the company could have remained completely unaware of the apparent theft of large amounts of data, every day, for five years.” Huawei headquarters in Shenzhen, China A Huawei spokesman told the BBC: “If there was  a data leak from computers at the AU's headquarters in Addis that went on for an extended period of time, these data leaks did not originate in technology supplied by Huawei to the AU. What Huawei supplied for the AU project  included data centre facilities, but those facilities did not have any storage or data transfer functions.” There is no evidence to indicate that Huawei’s telecoms network equipment was ever used by the Chinese government - or anyone else - to gain access to the data of their customers. Huawei was one of a number of suppliers to the project. Indeed, no-one has ever gone on record to confirm that the AU system was compromised in the first place. But these reports played into years of suspicions about Huawei - that a large Chinese company might find itself unduly influenced by the Chinese government. “When I first started out 30 years ago… we didn’t really have any telephones. The only phones we had were those hand-cranked phones that you see in old World War II films. We were pretty undeveloped then.” Huawei’s founder and chairman Ren Zhengfei is reminiscing to the BBC about the origins of the world’s second-biggest smartphone firm, while sitting in the Huawei headquarters in Shenzhen - a symbol of the success that he’s worked his whole lifetime for. A long marbled staircase, covered in plush red carpet, greets you as you first walk in. At the top of the stairs, a giant painting depicts a traditional Chinese New Year scene. Inside Huawei's Shenzhen HQ A few kilometres away in Dongguan, Huawei’s latest campus is even more eye-catching. The site - designed to accommodate the company’s 25,000 R&D staff - comprises 12 “villages”, each of which recreates the architecture of a different European city, among them Paris, Bologna and Granada. It’s as if Silicon Valley had been re-imagined by Walt Disney. Long corridors of Roman pillars and picturesque French cafes adorn the campus, with a train connecting the different areas, running through manicured gardens and past an artificial lake. “When I first started out 30 years ago… we didn’t really have any telephones.

Not Italy... It’s as if Silicon Valley had been re-imagined by Walt Disney. Long corridors of Roman pillars and picturesque French cafes adorn the campus, with a train connecting the different areas, running through manicured gardens and past an artificial lake. ...but Huawei's Dongguan Campus It’s a world away from the environment that Mr Ren found himself in when he first started the company in 1987. “I founded Huawei when China began to implement its reform and opening up policy,” he says. “At that time, China was shifting from a planned economy to a market economy. Not only people like myself, but even the most senior government officials, did not have the vaguest idea of what a market economy was. It seemed it was hard to survive.” Ren was born in 1944 in Southern China - a tumultuous, chaotic place, one of the poorest regions in an already destitute country. For a long time, hardship was all he ever knew. He was from a family of seven children. “They were very poor,” says David De Cremer, who has co-written a book on Ren and Huawei. “I think hardship is something that you can see throughout his life, and which he keeps emphasising himself.” To escape that life of poverty and drudgery, Ren did what many young Chinese men of that era did. He joined the army. Soldiers from the People's Liberation Army, 1972 “I was a very low-ranking officer in the People’s Liberation Army,” he says. “I served in an ordinary construction project, not a field unit. At the time, I was a technician of a company in the military, and then I became an engineer.” He left the military in 1983 when China began to downsize its forces, and went into the electronics business. By his own admission, he wasn’t a great businessman at first. “I was someone who had been in the military all my life at the time, used to doing what I was told,” he says. “Suddenly, I began to work in a market economy. I was at a total loss. So I too suffered losses, I too was deceived, and I was cheated.” But he was quick to learn, and was a keen student of Western business practices and European history. “I did research on what exactly a market economy was all about,” he says. “I read books on laws, including those about European and US laws. At that time, there were very few books on Chinese laws, and I had to read those on European and US laws.” Five years later, he founded Huawei  - the name can be translated as “splendid achievement” or “China is able” - to sell simple telecoms equipment to the rural Chinese market. Within a few years, Huawei was developing and producing the equipment itself. Sometime in the early 90s, Huawei won a government contract to provide telecoms equipment for the People’s Liberation Army. By 1995, the company was generating sales of around US$220m, mainly from selling to the rural market. The following year Huawei was given the status of a Chinese “national champion”. In practice, this meant the government closed the market to foreign competition. At a time when China’s economy was growing by an average of 10% per year, this was no small advantage. But it was only when Huawei started to expand overseas in 2000, that it really saw its sales soar. In 2002, Huawei made US$552m from its international market sales. By 2005 its international market contracts exceeded its domestic business for the first time. Ren’s early days in business instilled in him a desire to protect his company from the whims and fancies of the stock market. Huawei is privately held and employee-owned. This gave Ren the power to plough more money back into research and development. Each year, Huawei spends US$20bn on R&D – one of the biggest such budgets in the world. “Publicly listed companies have to pay a lot of attention to their balance sheets,” he says. “They can't invest too much, otherwise profits will drop and so will their share prices. At Huawei, we fight for our ideals. We know that if we fertilise our ‘soil’ it will become more bountiful. That's how we've managed to pull ahead and succeed.” One story from the early days of the company tells how Ren was cooking for his staff (he loves to cook, or so the story goes). Suddenly he rushed out of the kitchen and announced to the room: “Huawei will be a top three player in the global communications market 20 years from now!” And that’s exactly what happened. In fact, those ambitions were surpassed. Today, Huawei is the world’s biggest seller of network telecommunications equipment. From aspiring to be a company like Apple, it now sells more smartphones than Apple. But shadows have continued to loom over Huawei’s international success. Ren and Huawei’s links to the Chinese Communist Party have raised suspicions that the company owes its meteoric rise to its powerful political connections in China. The US has accused Huawei of being a tool of the Chinese government. It’s an accusation which Ren denies. “Please don't think that Huawei has become what it is today because we have special connections,” he says. “Even 100% state-owned companies have failed. Do good connections mean you will succeed then? Huawei’s success is still very much due to our hard work.” It was 1 December 2018. US President Donald Trump and China’s President Xi Jinping were dining on grilled sirloin followed by caramel rolled pancakes at the G20 summit in Buenos Aires. They had a lot to discuss. The US and China were in the middle of a trade war - imposing tariffs on each other’s goods - and growth forecasts for both countries had recently been cut as a result. This was adding to the fear of a slowing global economy. In the event, the two leaders agreed a truce in the trade war, with Donald Trumptweetingthat “Relations with China have taken a BIG leap forward!” Xi Jinping and Donald Trump at dinner, December 2018 But thousands of kilometres north in Canada, an arrest was taking place that would throw doubt on this rapprochement. Meng Wanzhou, Huawei’s chief financial officer and Ren Zhengfei’s eldest daughter, had been detained by Canadian officials while transferring between flights at Vancouver airport. The arrest had come at the request of the US, who accused her of breaking sanctions against Iran. “When she was detained, as her father, my heart broke,” says Ren, visibly emotional. “How could I watch my child suffer like this? But what happened, has happened. We can only depend on the law to solve this problem.” Meng Wanzhou being driven to court in Canada Huawei’s problems were just beginning. Nearly two months later, the US Department of Justice filed two indictments against Huawei and Ms Meng. Under the first indictment, Huawei and Ms Meng were charged with misleading banks and the US government about their business in Iran. The second indictment - against Huawei - involved criminal charges including obstruction of justice and the attempted theft of trade secrets. Both Huawei and Ms Meng deny the charges. January 2019: Acting US attorney general Matthew Whittaker announces charges against Huawei and Meng Wanzhou The charge of stealing trade secrets centres on a robotic tool - developed by T-Mobile - known as Tappy. According to legal documents, Huawei had tried to buy Tappy, a device which mimicked human fingers by tapping mobile phone screens rapidly to test responsiveness. T-Mobile was in partnership with Huawei at the time, but it rebuffed the Chinese firm’s offers, fearing it would use the technology to make phones for T-Mobile’s competitors. It’s alleged that one of Huawei’s US employees then smuggled Tappy’s robotic arm into his satchel so that he could send its details to colleagues in China. After the alleged theft was discovered, the Huawei employee claimed that the arm had  mistakenly fallen into his bag. Huawei claimed that the employee had been acting alone, and the case was settled out of court in 2014. But the latest case is built on email trails between managers in China and the company’s US employees, linking Huawei management to the alleged theft. The indictment also details evidence of a bonus scheme from 2013, offering Huawei employees financial rewards for stealing confidential information from competitors. Huawei has denied any such scheme exists. Meng Wanzhou, photographed in 2014 This is not the first time that Huawei has been accused of stealing trade secrets. Over the years companies like Cisco, Nortel and Motorola have all pointed the finger at the Chinese firm. But US fears about Huawei are about much more than industrial espionage. For more than a decade, the US government has seen the company as little more than an arm of the Chinese Communist Party. These concerns have been brought to the fore with the advent of “fifth generation” or5G mobile internet, which promises download speeds 10 or 20 times faster than at present, and much greater connectivity between devices. As the world’s biggest telecoms infrastructure provider, Huawei is one of the companies best placed to build new 5G networks. But the US has warned its intelligence partners that awarding contracts to Huawei would be tantamount to allowing the Chinese spy on them. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo recently cautioned against Huawei, saying, “If a country adopts this and puts it in some of their critical information systems, we won’t be able to share information with them.” US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo The UK, Germany and Canada are reviewing whether Huawei's products pose a security threat. Australia went a step further last year, andbanned equipment suppliers“likely to be subject to extrajudicial directions from a foreign government”. Huawei was not mentioned by name, but Danielle Cave of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute says the company posed a national security risk because of its government links. She cites an article in Chinese law that makes it impossible for any company to refuse to help the Chinese Communist Party in intelligence gathering. “Admittedly, what is missing from this debate is the smoking gun,” she says. “For the average person who has a Huawei smartphone it’s not a big deal. But if you’re a Western government that has key national security to protect - why would you allow this access to a company that is in the political system that China is in?” For his part, Ren says that Huawei’s resources have never and would never be used to spy for the Chinese government. “The Chinese government has clearly said that it won’t ask companies to install backdoors,” he says. A “backdoor” is a term used to describe a secret entry point in software or a computer system that gives access to the person or entity who installed it to the inner workings of the system. “Huawei will not do it either,” he continues. “Our sales revenues are now hundreds of billions of dollars. We are not going to risk the disgust of our country and our customers all over the world because of something like that. We will lose all our business. I’m not going to take that risk.” Zhou Daiqi is Huawei’s chief ethics and compliance officer. He’s been with the company for nearly 25 years, in a number of different positions - chief engineer, director of the hardware department, head of the research centre in Xi’an, according to his biography on the company’s website. He is also understood to combine his high-ranking executive duties with another role - party secretary of Huawei’s Communist Party committee. All companies in China are required by law to have a Communist Party committee. Zhou Daiqi's profile on Huawei's website The official line is that they exist to ensure that employees uphold the country’s moral and social values. Representatives of the committee are also often tasked with helping workers with financial problems. But critics of China’s one-party system argue that they allow the state to exert control on corporate China. And they say the level of this control has increased in recent years. “[President] Xi Jinping is exerting greater control over the business community in China,” says Elliott Zaagman, who regularly advises Chinese companies on their PR strategy. “As these companies gain power and influence overseas, the party doesn’t want to lose control over them.” Ren, however, argues that the role of Huawei’s Communist Party committee is far less important than many in the West believe. “[It] serves only to educate its employees,” he says. “It is not involved in any business decisions.” In China, most chief executives are Communist Party members. Every year, they dutifully turn up to the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPCC) which happens in parallel to the National People's Congress (NPC). The NPC is attended by local and national party chiefs, officials and chief executives. But the CPCC is where the business community shows its commitment to the party. Being a member of the party is very much a networking opportunity - in the way one would join a business association. Elliott Zaagman argues that this is a system that demands loyalty. “There is no separation from the party and the state,” he says. “The system in China encourages the lack of transparency in companies like Huawei.” The worry is that these close links mean that if the Communist Party asked a company to do something, they would have no choice but to comply. And if that company is one that is involved in sensitive global telecoms infrastructure projects, it’s easy to see why Western observers would be worried. There is no evidence to indicate that Huawei is in any way under the orders of the Chinese government, or that Beijing has any plans to dictate business plans and strategy at Huawei - particularly when it comes to spying. But the way in which the Chinese Communist Party has robustly defended Huawei has raised questions about how independent the company is of its influence. For example, Beijing stated that Ms Meng’s detention wasa rights abuse. And while her extradition case to the US was moving forward, China detained two Canadian citizens andaccused them of stealing state secrets. Critics say the detentions are linked to Ms Meng’s arrest. December 2018: Chinese police patrol outside Canada's embassy in Beijing While not commenting on the arrest of the Canadians, Ren says China’s defence of Huawei is understandable. “It is the Chinese government’s duty to protect its people,” he says. “If the US attempts to gain competitive edge by undermining China’s most outstanding hi-tech talent, then it is understandable if the Chinese government, in turn, protects its hi-tech companies.” Over the past few years, there have been signs ofa bigger push by the governmentto get private companies, and in particular tech firms, to cooperate with party rules - even when they are firmly resistant. A Didi Chuxing logo adorns a building in Hangzhou, China China’s ride-hailing giant Didi Chuxing’s troubles are an example of the struggles Chinese firms face when they try to uphold their independence in the face of government pressure. Chinese attitudes to data collection and data privacy are different to those in the West - many people don’t care if businesses have access to their data, arguing that it adds to the convenience of life and work. Government access to data in China is not the free-for-all that many outside of China assume it to be So it wasn’t unusual when, after the murders of two of its passengers by Didi drivers, regulators used the scandal to force Didi toshare more corporate data with the government.But Didi resisted - citing customer privacy. Under Chinese law, it had no choice but to comply. When it did, it handed over “three boxes of data printed on paper, including 95 hard copies for authorities to review”. According to Samm Sacks of the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), the case demonstrates that “government access to data in China is not the free-for-all that many outside China assume it to be”. She says this indicates that there appears to be “a kind of tug of war between the government and companies over data”. How this plays out will determine how Chinese companies are viewed by foreign governments when they do business overseas. Companies like Huawei have grown up in a system where to survive and thrive they needed strong links to the Chinese government - there was and is no other choice. But these links could harm their reputation abroad. “It’s two different systems,” says Zaagman. “Think of it like an electrical outlet. China’s plug doesn’t fit in to the outlets we have in the West.” Inside Huawei's Shenzhen HQ “Basically you want to connect to everything that can be connected.” Zhu Peiying, head of Huawei’s 5G wireless labs, is showing off devices that can connect to the new technology. From a smart toothbrush that collects data about how well you brush your teeth, to a smart cup that reminds you when you should drink some water, this is a world where everything you can think of is being measured and analysed. At its most sophisticated, everything in entire cities would be connected - driverless cars, the temperature of buildings, the speed of public transport - the list is endless. Huawei is thought to be a year ahead of its competitors in terms of its technological expertise and what it can offer customers, according to industry sources. It’s also thought that the company can offer prices that are about 10% cheaper than its competitors, although critics claim this is because of state support. Ren dismisses this, saying that Huawei doesn’t receive government subsidies. He says the real reason behind the US resistance to Huawei is its superior technology. “There’s no way the US can crush us,” he says. “The world needs Huawei because we are more advanced. Even if they persuade more countries not to use us temporarily we could just scale things down a bit.” Many analysts say that Huawei’s exclusion from US networks could actually cause the US to fall behind in its 5G capabilities. “It would mean we wouldn’t be able to participate in any blended network [using Huawei] in Europe or Asia,” says Samm Sacks of CSIS. “That would put us at a significant disadvantage.” What this would mean in reality is a world of two internets - or what analysts are calling a ""digital iron curtain"" - dividing the world into parts that do business with Chinese companies like Huawei, and those that don't. Because of US pressure on its allies, Huawei has been on an aggressive public relations campaign to win over customers and government stakeholders. In recent days, Vodafone’s boss Nick Read called on the US to share any evidence it has about Huawei, while Andrus Ansip, the European Commission’s vice president for the digital single market, said in a tweet that he had met with Huawei’s rotating CEO to discuss the importance of being open and transparent, as they explored ways of working together. But suspicions about Huawei remain. One security firm reports a sharp rise in inquiries by Asian government clients about Huawei. ""Some have asked us how much they should worry about whether Huawei is really a liability,"" says an analyst who consults to Asian governments, on condition of anonymity. Ren is sanguine about such concerns. “For countries who believe in them [suspicions about Huawei] we will hold off,” he says.  “For countries who feel Huawei is trustworthy, we may move a little faster. The world is so big. We can't walk across every corner of it.” But this is about more than just one company or one CEO and his family. Increasingly, this is perceived as a battle between two world orders, and which one is the future. In the early days of China opening up, US presidents like George HW Bush espoused the merits of engagement. “No nation on Earth has discovered a way to import the world's goods and services while stopping foreign ideas at the border,”he said in a 1991 speech. “Just as the democratic idea has transformed nations on every continent, so, too, change will inevitably come to China.” 1989: George HW Bush in Beijing - he encouraged economic engagement with China Previous US administrations believed that economic engagement in China would lead to China following a freer, more “liberal” path. There’s no denying China has made remarkable strides in the past 40 years. The economy grew by an annual average of 10% for three decades, helping to lift 800 million people out of poverty. It is now the second-largest economy in the world, only surpassed by the US. Some estimates put China’s economy ahead of America’s by 2030. It achieved this while maintaining one-party rule and the supremacy of the Communist Party. But its success has raised concerns that it is only possible with a huge amount of government control over the country’s companies. The fear is that control could be used to achieve the Communist Party’s goals - which are at this point unclear. “It’s a double-edged sword for China,” says Danielle Cave. “[Because of its laws] the Chinese Communist Party has made it virtually impossible for Chinese companies to expand without attracting understandable and legitimate suspicion.” Added to this, China has become more authoritarian under Xi Jinping’s rule. President Xi Jinping “Xi is systematically undermining virtually every feature that made China so distinct and helped it work so well in the past,”writes Jonathan Tepperman, editor in chief of Foreign Policy. “His efforts may boost his own power and prestige in the short term and reduce some forms of corruption. On balance, however, Xi’s campaign will have disastrous long-term consequences for his country and the world.” But Ren dismisses this, insisting that China is more open than ever before. “If this meeting took place 30 years ago,” he says of our interview, “it would have been very dangerous for me. Today, I can be straightforward when answering difficult questions. This shows that China has a more open political environment.” Still, Ren is hopeful of the direction China will take in the future. “China has more or less tried to close itself off from the outside world for 5,000 years,” he says. “Yet we had found ourselves poor, lagging behind other nations. It was only in the past 30 years since Deng Xiaoping opened China's doors to the world that China has become more prosperous. Therefore, China must continue to move forward on the path of reform and opening-up.” In one of Huawei’s vast campus sites across Shenzen, lies a man-made lake. Swimming in these serene waters are two black swans. There is a story that Ren put the birds here to remind employees of “black swan” events - unpredictable and catastrophic financial eventualities that are impossible to prepare for. He dismisses this as an urban myth, but it’s hard not to read something into it. For Huawei, and Ren, these are highly uncertain times with no way of telling what lies ahead. Built with Shorthand"
Kuenssberg: Rapid hunt leads to sacking,"As a relatively new defence secretary, Gavin Williamson once said that Russia should ""go away and shut up"". Well, the prime minister has told him to go away because in her view, he did not shut up. In a leak investigation, that has broken the precedent of most leak investigations that end up with precisely no result at all, a rapid hunt of just a few days has resulted in the sacking of one of the most senior ministers in government, and one of the few ministers frankly, that the prime minister could more or less rely on. Mr Williamson was for a while chief whip too, the keeper of the government's secrets. And, crucially, one of the few ministers who had good relations with the DUP. Indeed, brokering a deal on Theresa May's behalf in the wreckage of the 2017 general election. But there was also a lot of resentment and frustration in government circles at how he sometimes behaved, suspicion often that he was too quick to seek his own political advantage, too interested in his own future, too entertained by the dark arts of Westminster. That meant that as soon as the Huawei story broke, fingers were being privately pointed to him as the source of the leak. ""Operation get Gav"", as one of his allies described it. Gavin Williamson sacked over Huawei leak Ministers were quick to write to Number 10 demanding a full inquiry, some of them privately fuming that ""it must have been Williamson"". Number 10 now says there was ""compelling evidence"" to prove that it was him. Officials carrying out the inquiry did look at his phone. He did, by his own admission, have a conversation on the particular day with the journalist who broke the story. Downing Street has made a very serious accusation and is sure enough to carry out this sacking. For the prime minister's allies, it will show that she is, despite the political turmoil, still strong enough to move some of her ministers around - to hire and fire. Mr Williamson is strenuously still denying that the leak was anything to do with him at all. There is nothing fond, or anything conciliatory, in either the letter from the prime minister to him, or his reply back to her. Exchange of letters between May and Williamson Profile: Gavin Williamson And having had a fractious relationship with the National Security Adviser and Cabinet Secretary, Sir Mark Sedwill, some of Mr Williamson's friends believe that those looking into the affair were simply too quick to conclude the former defence secretary was responsible, treating him differently in this short investigation, compared to others who were on the list. One senior Conservative also points out a rich irony here, saying: ""A government that governs by open leaking then sacks someone for not being open about their leaking. We have surely moved from the incompetent to the theatre of the absurd!"" These are strange times indeed.

Tensions high amid new Venezuela protests,"This video can not be played Tear gas and water cannon hit Venezuela protesters Venezuelan opposition supporters have been holding mass protests, a day after violent clashes with government forces. ""We will keep going with more strength than ever,"" opposition leader Juan GuaidÃ³ tweeted. Pro-government rallies are also taking place. The rival demonstrations come after President NicolÃ¡s Maduro said he had stopped an ""attempted coup"" on Tuesday. Mr GuaidÃ³ says he is backed by members of the armed forces, but Mr Maduro insists he still has their support. In a fiery television address on Tuesday,Mr Maduro accused protesters of ""serious crimes""which he said would ""not go unpunished"", and said the US was plotting against him. Venezuela crisis in 300 words Who is Juan GuaidÃ³? Profile: NicolÃ¡s Maduro Mr GuaidÃ³ declared himself Venezuela's interim leader in January and has been recognised by more than 50 countries, including the US, the UK and most in Latin America. But Mr Maduro - backed by Russia, China and the top of the country's military - has refused to cede leadership to his rival. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said military action was ""possible"" if necessary but that the US would prefer a peaceful transition of power. Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov warned the US against further ""aggressive"" steps. The UN meanwhile called on both sides to exercise ""maximum restraint"". Mr GuaidÃ³ addressed his supporters in Caracas on Wednesday Addressing his supporters in Caracas, Mr GuaidÃ³ called the protests an ""irreversible process"" and vowed to continue demonstrations every day ""to achieve freedom"". ""We are on the right track, there is no turning back,"" he said. He also said there would be a series of staggered strikes starting on Thursday and culminating in a general strike. Local media report gunfire in Altamira, a neighbourhood in east Caracas where the opposition regularly gathers. There were also clashes on a highway close to an airbase in the east of the capital, with protesters driving a van through the perimeter fence. National Guard on motorbikes fired tear gas at the demonstrators. Some demonstrators threw stones, while others have been seen making Molotov cocktails. Demonstrations have taken place in all 23 states of Venezuela as well as in Caracas, NGOs and local media say. There were also pro-government protests in Venezuela The UN Human Rights Office has said it is ""extremely worried"" by reports,externalof security forces using ""excessive"" force against demonstrators. ""We call on all sides to show maximum restraint and on the authorities to respect the right to peaceful assembly,"" spokesperson Marta Hurtado said. But there were also pro-government demonstrations, with President Maduro saying workers were gathering across the country to celebrate May Day. By Guillermo Olmo, BBC Venezuela correspondent Juan GuaidÃ³ had appeared to be losing momentum but it seems that Tuesday's events have revived his bid. The La Carlota airbase, where the violent clashes took place yesterday, looks like a war zone. It was covered with broken glass and pieces of brick and stone, as well as bullet cases and gas canisters. There were burnt motorbikes and a burned-out bus blocking the street. In the west side of the city there was a pro-government demonstration. Despite very few attendants at the last rallies called by the government, this one on Wednesday seemed to be full of their supporters. May Day has always been a very significant date for the leftist Venezuelan government - it is something they have traditionally marked. The pro-government march was peaceful; there was a party atmosphere there, with music and dancing. From there we went to a square in Altamira, an opposition stronghold. It was also full of people, peaceful protesters so far - although there are reports coming through of shots fired somewhere in the city. There were more attendants than in the last protests called by Mr GuaidÃ³. But the rest of the city was completely calm. We've seen people walking dogs and buying fruit. Some said they could not go to work on Tuesday because their employers told them not to go, but their areas have remained peaceful. Mr GuaidÃ³ posted a video showing him with a number of men in military uniform. He said he had the support of ""brave soldiers"" in Caracas. He urged Venezuelans to join them in the streets, and appeared alongside another opposition leader, Leopoldo LÃ³pez, who has been under house arrest since 2014. Supporters on both sides then gathered around Caracas throughout the day, and there were clashes between Mr GuaidÃ³'s supporters and armed military vehicles. This video can not be played Military vehicles were filmed driving into demonstrators on Tuesday Spain's government later confirmed that Mr LÃ³pez and his family had sought safety in their embassy, but said the opposition figure has not claimed political asylum. Chilean foreign minister Roberto Ampuero confirmed on Twitter he had initially come to their embassy but later transferred to Spain's. Is there a new cult of personality in Venezuela? 'Like living in the apocalypse' The bridge of desperation Mr GuaidÃ³, the president of the opposition-controlled National Assembly, has called on Venezuela's military to back him, saying President Maduro is a ""usurper"" because he was re-elected in polls that had been widely disputed. Mr GuaidÃ³, pictured here standing on the car, has declared himself the interim president UN Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres has appealed for both sides to avoid violence, whilethe EU has called for ""utmost restraint to avoid the loss of lives and an escalation in tensions"",external. The US has reiterated its support for Mr GuaidÃ³. Meanwhile, National Security Adviser John Bolton has accused Russia and Cuba of interfering in Venezuelan politics, claiming Mr Maduro was planning to flee to Cuba but was persuaded to stay by Moscow. But both Russia and Mr Maduro rejected the claim, with a Russian foreign ministry spokesperson accusing the US of conducting an ""information war"". Mr Lavrov spoke to Mr Pompeo on the phone on Wednesday, warning him of grave consequences if the US took further ""aggressive"" steps in Venezuela, saying US ""interference"" in the country broke international law. This video can not be played Why Venezuela matters to the US... and vice versa Governments who still back Mr Maduro - including Bolivia and Cuba - condemned Mr GuaidÃ³'s efforts as an attempted ""coup d'etat"". The Mexican government expressed ""concern about a possible increase in violence"" while Colombian President Ivan Duque urged the Venezuelan military to stand ""on the right side of history"" against Mr Maduro.

What is 5G and what will it mean for you?,"High-speed mobile could enable robots, sensors and other machines to communicate Superfast fifth generation, or 5G, mobile internet services are already on offer. You can't get it everywhere yet and handset choices remains limited. But that will change in the coming months, so what difference will 5G make to our lives? It's the next generation of mobile internet connection and offers much faster data download and upload speeds. Through greater use of the radio spectrum it will allow far more devices to access the mobile internet at the same time. ""Whatever we do now with our smartphones we'll be able to do faster and better,"" says Ian Fogg from OpenSignal, a mobile data analytics company. ""Think of smart glasses featuring augmented reality, mobile virtual reality, much higher quality video, the internet of things making cities smarter. ""But what's really exciting is all the new services that will be built that we can't foresee."" Driverless cars will be able to ""talk"" to each other and traffic management systems Imagine swarms of drones co-operating to carry out search and rescue missions, fire assessments and traffic monitoring, all communicating wirelessly with each other and ground base stations over 5G networks. Similarly, many think 5G will be crucial for autonomous vehicles to communicate with each other and read live map and traffic data. Mobile gamers should notice less delay - or latency - when pressing a button on a controller and seeing the effect on screen. Mobile videos should be near instantaneous and glitch-free. Video calls should become clearer and less jerky. Wearable fitness devices could monitor your health in real time, alerting doctors as soon as any emergency arises. It's a new radio technology, but you might not notice vastly higher speeds at first because 5G is likely to be used by network operators initially as a way to boost capacity on existing 4G core networks, to ensure a more consistent service for customers. The speed you get will depend on which spectrum band the operator runs the 5G technology on and how much your carrier has invested in new masts and transmitters. This video can not be played WATCH: What the superfast 5G connection will mean So we may see clusters of smaller phone masts closer to the ground transmitting so-called ""millimetre waves"" between much higher numbers of transmitters and receivers. This will enable higher density of usage. But it's expensive and companies could face challenges deploying lots of new masts. So how fast could it be? The fastest current 4G mobile networks offer about 45Mbps (megabits per second) on average, although the industry is still hopeful of achieving 1Gbps (gigabit per second = 1,000Mbps) Chipmaker Qualcomm reckons 5G could achieve browsing and download speeds about 10 to 20 times faster in real-world (as opposed to laboratory) conditions. That would allow you to download a high-definition film in a minute or so. This video can not be played Does Nokia's lightning-quick 5G demo give us a glimpse of the future? The big improvement in speed and latency will come when service providers roll out standalone 5G networks, where both the core and radio networks use 5G tech. They could easily achieve gigabit-plus browsing speeds as standard. But these aren't likely to come until next year in the UK. The world is going mobile and we're consuming more data every year, particularly as the popularity of video and music streaming increases. Existing spectrum bands are becoming congested, leading to breakdowns in service, particularly when lots of people in the same area are trying to access online mobile services at the same time. 5G is much better at handling thousands of devices simultaneously, from mobiles to equipment sensors, video cameras to smart street lights. Yes. But when 4G was introduced in 2009/10, compatible smart phones came onto the market before the infrastructure had been rolled out fully, leading to some frustration amongst consumers who felt they were paying more in subscriptions for a patchy service. Lack of signal and low data speeds in rural areas is a common complaint in the UK and many other countries. But 5G won't necessarily address this issue as it will operate on high-frequency bands - to start with at least - that have a lot of capacity but cover shorter distances. 5G will primarily be an urban service for densely populated areas. Lower-frequency bands (600-800Mhz typically) are better over longer distances, so network operators will concentrate on improving their 4G LTE coverage in parallel with 5G roll-out. But commercial reality means that for some people in very remote areas, connectivity will still be patchy at best without government subsidy making it worthwhile for network operators to go to these places.

Profile: Gavin Williamson,"Sir Gavin Williamson is in the spotlight again, after he resigned from the government amid accusations of bullying and harassment. Former chief whip Wendy Morton has handed over a series of expletive-laden text messages from Sir Gavin to Parliament's bullying watchdog and made a complaint to Tory HQ about his conduct. Following a report in the Guardian that Sir Gavin told a senior civil servant to ""slit your throat"" and ""jump out of the window"" when he was defence secretary, No 10 said it would be conducting its own informal investigation. In his resignation letter, Sir Gavin said allegations about his ""past conduct"" were becoming a distraction for the government - even though he ""refutes the characterisation of these claims"",externaland has apologised to the recipient of some text messages. This is the third time Sir Gavin has had to leave government, having already been sacked from cabinet twice previously - as education secretary and defence secretary. His rise through the Conservative ranks has been blown off course by a number of separate scandals. However, he has been widely seen as a political survivor, serving under four different prime ministers. The 46-year-old was raised near Scarborough, North Yorkshire, by Labour-supporting parents. Educated at state schools, he became involved in Tory politics while studying at Bradford University and later went on to become a county councillor in North Yorkshire. A former fireplace salesman, he also ran a pottery firm, making and selling ceramic tableware, before being elected as MP for South Staffordshire in 2010. Sir Gavin began his parliamentary career as a ministerial aide to David Cameron, acting as the then-prime minister's bag carrier and eyes and ears at Westminster. He remained in this important role until Mr Cameron left office in June 2016. After Theresa May became prime minister, he was made chief whip, responsible for keeping MPs in line and enforcing party discipline. In the aftermath of the disastrous 2017 election, he played a crucial role in paving the way for the Conservatives' agreement with the Democratic Unionists to prop up Mrs May's minority government. Sir Gavin Williamson (right) shakes hands with the DUP's Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, after the party signed a deal to prop up Theresa May's government In his role as chief whip he was known for keeping a tarantula called Cronus on his desk. Describing his methods in the whips office, he told the Conservative Party conference in 2017: ""We take a carrot and stick approach... Personally I don't much like the stick, but it is amazing what can be achieved with a sharpened carrot."" Nick Timothy - a senior adviser to Mrs May - described Mr Williamson as an ""excellent"" chief whip, who was ""a shrewd tactician"" and ""a judge of character"". ""Even MPs who don't like him admit that he was the best chief whip the party has had in decades - and he did it through some of the hardest years,""he said in a tweet.,external Sir Gavin's promotion to defence secretary in November 2017 came as a surprise to some within the Tory Party and the armed forces. He had no military background and little opportunity to build up a public profile because his role in the whips office meant he did not speak in Parliament. While at the Ministry of Defence he lobbied successfully for more funding for the military, often to the irritation of the Treasury. But he was derided in the press for telling Russia to ""shut up and go away"", and for suggestions the UK should respond in kind to ""acts of warfare"" by the Kremlin. His downfall came after an inquiry into a leak from a top-level National Security Council meeting about whether to allow Chinese firm Huawei to help build the UK's 5G network. Sir Gavin denied leaking information from the meeting, but Mrs May said she had ""lost confidence in his ability to serve"" and sacked him in May 2019. Sir Gavin faced protests from pupils in the summer of 2020 after their A-level results were downgraded He was not on the backbenches for long and returned to cabinet as education secretary in July the same year, when Boris Johnson became prime minister. When the Covid pandemic broke out in 2020, the role became even more high profile, with Sir Gavin responsible for tricky areas including home-learning and managing the return to classrooms and exams when schools fully reopened. He was widely criticised for U-turning over getting all primary school pupils back in school after lockdown and there were also clashes with footballer Marcus Rashford over his campaign to provide children with free meals during holidays. Perhaps the biggest debacle was the chaos of the 2020 school exam period, with multiple U-turns over how to grade pupils after examinations were cancelled because of the pandemic. This resulted in his department's most senior civil servant and the head of the exams watchdog both leaving their roles. Sir Gavin stayed put until September 2021, when he was replaced by Nadhim Zahawi. Some argued he had been made a political fall guy - used as a lightning rod for the criticism of how the government had dealt with the challenges Covid posed to education and taking the blame for decisions that were never down to an individual minister. But in March,the news he would receive a knighthood for his political and public serviceprompted anger from some teachers and parents, who blamed him - at least in part - for the mistakes on schools policy during the pandemic. The story of the Covid exam results U-turn Where did it go wrong for Williamson as education secretary? Sir Gavin returned to cabinet as a minister without portfolio under Mr Sunak in October. But it took less than two weeks for concerns to be raised about his appointment following claims he had bullied a fellow Conservative MP. In texts sent to then-Chief Whip Ms Morton in the run-up to the Queen's funeral in September he appeared to complain that MPs who were not favoured by Prime Minister Liz Truss were being excluded from the ceremony at Westminster Abbey. In the messages,published by the Sunday Times,external, Sir Gavin reportedly warned Ms Morton ""not to push him about"" and that ""there is a price for everything"". He was quoted by the paper as saying he regretted ""getting frustrated"" and was happy to ""work positively with [Ms Morton] in the future as I have in the past"". No 10 described the messages as ""unacceptable"" but the prime minister's official spokesman insisted Mr Sunak had full confidence in Sir Gavin. When he resigned, the prime minister said he accepted his resignation with ""great sadness"" but understood his decision to step back. Separately an unnamed official at the Minister of Defence saidSir Gavin ""deliberately demeaned and intimidated"" them. The official said they raised concerns to the Ministry of Defence's human resources department, but did not make a formal complaint at the time. Sir Gavin did not deny using the language attributed to him but said he ""strongly"" rejected allegations of bullying. However, the pressure of multiple accusations and inquiries became too great, and Sir Gavin was forced to step down. Writing in his resignation letter, he said he would ""clear my name of wrongdoing"" but it remains to be seen if this consummate Westminster operator can, once again, bounce back.

May's letter in full sacking Williamson,"Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson has been sacked by the prime minister after information from a National Security Council meeting was leaked to a newspaper. Here is Theresa May's full letter dismissing him. ""Dear Gavin, Thank you for your time this evening. We discussed the investigation into the unauthorised disclosure of information from the National Security Council meeting on 23 April. This is an extremely serious matter, and a deeply disappointing one. It is vital for the operation of good government and for the UK's national interest in some of the most sensitive and important areas that the members of the NSC - from our Armed Forces, our Security and Intelligence Agencies, and the most senior level of government - are able to have frank and detailed discussions in full confidence that the advice and analysis provided is not discussed or divulged beyond that trusted environment. That is why I commissioned the cabinet secretary to establish an investigation into the unprecedented leak from the NSC meeting last week, and why I expected everyone connected to it - ministers and officials alike - to comply with it fully. You undertook to do so. I am therefore concerned by the manner in which you have engaged with this investigation. It has been conducted fairly, with the full co-operation of other NSC attendees. They have all answered questions, engaged properly, provided as much information as possible to assist with the investigation, and encouraged their staff to do the same. Your conduct has not been of the same standard as others. In our meeting this evening, I put to you the latest information from the investigation, which provides compelling evidence suggesting your responsibility for the unauthorised disclosure. No other credible version of events to explain this leak has been identified. It is vital that I have full confidence in the members of my cabinet and of the National Security Council. The gravity of this issue alone, and its ramifications for the operation of the NSC and the UK's national interest, warrants the serious steps we have taken, and an equally serious response. It is therefore with great sadness that I have concluded that I can no longer have full confidence in you as secretary of state for defence and a minister in my cabinet and asked you to leave Her Majesty's government. As you do so, I would like to thank you for the wider contribution you have made to it over the last three years, and for your unquestionable personal commitment to the men and women of our Armed Forces."" ""Dear Prime Minister, It has been a great privilege to serve as Defence Secretary and Chief Whip in your government. Every day I have seen the extraordinary work of the men and women of our armed forces, who go to incredible lengths to defend our country. I am sorry that you feel recent leaks from the National Security Council originated in my department. I emphatically believe this was not the case. I strenuously deny that I was in any way involved in this leak and I am confident that a thorough and formal inquiry would have vindicated my position. I have always trusted my civil servants, military advisers and staff. I believe the assurances they have given me. I appreciate you offering me the option to resign, but to resign would have been to accept that I, my civil servants, my military advisers or my staff were responsible: this was not the case.

By-election in disgraced MP's constituency,"Fiona Onasanya was expelled by the Labour Party after her conviction Disgraced Fiona Onasanya has become the first MP to be removed by a recall petition. Ms Onasanya, 35, was jailed in January for lying about a speeding offence. She was expelled by Labour after her conviction and had been representing Peterborough as an independent. Peterborough City Council said 19,261 constituents had signed the petition. Ms Onasanya will be allowed to stand for re-election. The council said the signatures represented 27.6% of eligible residents. The threshold required to remove Ms Onasanya was 10%. Commons Speaker John Bercow confirmed the recall petition had been successful. He told MPs: ""Fiona Onasanya is no longer the member for Peterborough and the seat is accordingly vacant. ""She can therefore no longer participate in any parliamentary proceedings as a member of parliament."" Ms Onasanya, who was jailed for perverting the course of justice, has become the first MP to be removed by the recall process, introduced by David Cameron in 2015. She was first elected to Parliament as a Labour MP with a slender majority of 607 in 2017. The process by which the electorate can remove an MP before the end of their term was introduced in the UK in 2015 in response to the 2010 MPs' expenses scandal. The recall procedure can only be triggered under certain circumstances, including if an MP is convicted in the UK of an offence and sentenced or ordered to be imprisoned or detained - and all appeals have been exhausted. For a recall petition to be successful, 10% of eligible registered voters need to sign the petition. It remains open for six weeks. If successful, a by-election is called and the recalled MP is allowed to stand as a candidate. The first recall petition against an MP was triggered in July 2018 against North Antrim MP Ian Paisley after he failed to declare two holidays paid for by the Sri Lankan government. The petition was unsuccessful, as it was short of 444 signatures, and Mr Paisley remained an MP. The petition against Ms Onasanya is the first time a recall petition has been held in England. A third MP, Chris Davies, Conservative member for Brecon and Radnorshire,is facing a recall petitionin Wales after he was convicted for a false expenses claim. Source:UK Parliament,external Labour Party chairman Ian Lavery said: ""Labour campaigned hard for a victory in this recall petition. ""Labour will vigorously fight the by-election here in Peterborough."" Nigel Farage said his new Brexit Party would contest the by-election, but a spokesman said no decision had yet been taken on whether Mr Farage would be the candidate. The by-election in a city which voted 61% Leave in the 2016 EU referendum potentially offers the former UKIP leader a route to a seat in Parliament after seven unsuccessful attempts. Meanwhile, the former MP George Galloway - a Brexiteer - also declared on Twitter hisintention to stand in the by-election.,external Conservative parliamentary candidate for Peterborough Paul Bristow said: ""The people of Peterborough deserve a better MP who will vote in Parliament to deliver Brexit."" Fiona Onasanya made her first and last speech in the Commons last week following her release from prison Hannah Olsson, political reporter, BBC Radio Cambridgeshire The by-election in Peterborough will come in the middle of one of the most tumultuous times in modern political history. Brexit has shaken up political alliances like never before, but we don't know what impact that will have, and who it will favour. The by-election could be an opportunity for the new parties to test the popularity of what they're offering, but the question is what party will they be taking voters from? Another possibility is that Brexit has made everyone so fed up with politics that people in Peterborough will just decide not to vote at all, and we will see a very low turnout.

Tensions high amid fresh Venezuela protests,"This video can not be played Tear gas and water cannon hit Venezuela protesters Venezuelan opposition supporters have been holding mass protests, a day after violent clashes with government forces. ""We will keep going with more strength than ever,"" opposition leader Juan GuaidÃ³ tweeted. Pro-government rallies are also taking place. The rival demonstrations come after President NicolÃ¡s Maduro said he had stopped an ""attempted coup"" on Tuesday. Mr GuaidÃ³ says he is backed by members of the armed forces, but Mr Maduro insists he still has their support. In a fiery television address on Tuesday,Mr Maduro accused protesters of ""serious crimes""which he said would ""not go unpunished"", and said the US was plotting against him. Venezuela crisis in 300 words Who is Juan GuaidÃ³? Profile: NicolÃ¡s Maduro Mr GuaidÃ³ declared himself Venezuela's interim leader in January and has been recognised by more than 50 countries, including the US, the UK and most in Latin America. But Mr Maduro - backed by Russia, China and the top of the country's military - has refused to cede leadership to his rival. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said military action was ""possible"" if necessary but that the US would prefer a peaceful transition of power. Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov warned the US against further ""aggressive"" steps. The UN meanwhile called on both sides to exercise ""maximum restraint"". Mr GuaidÃ³ addressed his supporters in Caracas on Wednesday Addressing his supporters in Caracas, Mr GuaidÃ³ called the protests an ""irreversible process"" and vowed to continue demonstrations every day ""to achieve freedom"". ""We are on the right track, there is no turning back,"" he said. He also said there would be a series of staggered strikes starting on Thursday and culminating in a general strike. Local media report gunfire in Altamira, a neighbourhood in east Caracas where the opposition regularly gathers. There were also clashes on a highway close to an airbase in the east of the capital, with protesters driving a van through the perimeter fence. National Guard on motorbikes fired tear gas at the demonstrators. Some demonstrators threw stones, while others have been seen making Molotov cocktails. Demonstrations have taken place in all 23 states of Venezuela as well as in Caracas, NGOs and local media say. There were also pro-government protests in Venezuela The UN Human Rights Office has said it is ""extremely worried"" by reports,externalof security forces using ""excessive"" force against demonstrators. ""We call on all sides to show maximum restraint and on the authorities to respect the right to peaceful assembly,"" spokesperson Marta Hurtado said. But there were also pro-government demonstrations, with President Maduro saying workers were gathering across the country to celebrate May Day. By Guillermo Olmo, BBC Venezuela correspondent Juan GuaidÃ³ had appeared to be losing momentum but it seems that Tuesday's events have revived his bid. The La Carlota airbase, where the violent clashes took place yesterday, looks like a war zone. It was covered with broken glass and pieces of brick and stone, as well as bullet cases and gas canisters. There were burnt motorbikes and a burned-out bus blocking the street. In the west side of the city there was a pro-government demonstration. Despite very few attendants at the last rallies called by the government, this one on Wednesday seemed to be full of their supporters. May Day has always been a very significant date for the leftist Venezuelan government - it is something they have traditionally marked. The pro-government march was peaceful; there was a party atmosphere there, with music and dancing. From there we went to a square in Altamira, an opposition stronghold. It was also full of people, peaceful protesters so far - although there are reports coming through of shots fired somewhere in the city. There were more attendants than in the last protests called by Mr GuaidÃ³. But the rest of the city was completely calm. We've seen people walking dogs and buying fruit. Some said they could not go to work on Tuesday because their employers told them not to go, but their areas have remained peaceful. Mr GuaidÃ³ posted a video showing him with a number of men in military uniform. He said he had the support of ""brave soldiers"" in Caracas. He urged Venezuelans to join them in the streets, and appeared alongside another opposition leader, Leopoldo LÃ³pez, who has been under house arrest since 2014. Supporters on both sides then gathered around Caracas throughout the day, and there were clashes between Mr GuaidÃ³'s supporters and armed military vehicles. This video can not be played Military vehicles were filmed driving into demonstrators on Tuesday Spain's government later confirmed that Mr LÃ³pez and his family had sought safety in their embassy, but said the opposition figure has not claimed political asylum. Chilean foreign minister Roberto Ampuero confirmed on Twitter he had initially come to their embassy but later transferred to Spain's. Is there a new cult of personality in Venezuela? 'Like living in the apocalypse' The bridge of desperation Mr GuaidÃ³, the president of the opposition-controlled National Assembly, has called on Venezuela's military to back him, saying President Maduro is a ""usurper"" because he was re-elected in polls that had been widely disputed. Mr GuaidÃ³, pictured here standing on the car, has declared himself the interim president UN Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres has appealed for both sides to avoid violence, whilethe EU has called for ""utmost restraint to avoid the loss of lives and an escalation in tensions"",external. The US has reiterated its support for Mr GuaidÃ³. Meanwhile, National Security Adviser John Bolton has accused Russia and Cuba of interfering in Venezuelan politics, claiming Mr Maduro was planning to flee to Cuba but was persuaded to stay by Moscow. But both Russia and Mr Maduro rejected the claim, with a Russian foreign ministry spokesperson accusing the US of conducting an ""information war"". Mr Lavrov spoke to Mr Pompeo on the phone on Wednesday, warning him of grave consequences if the US took further ""aggressive"" steps in Venezuela, saying US ""interference"" in the country broke international law. This video can not be played Why Venezuela matters to the US... and vice versa Governments who still back Mr Maduro - including Bolivia and Cuba - condemned Mr GuaidÃ³'s efforts as an attempted ""coup d'etat"". The Mexican government expressed ""concern about a possible increase in violence"" while Colombian President Ivan Duque urged the Venezuelan military to stand ""on the right side of history"" against Mr Maduro.

May seeks EU exit well before October deadline,"This video can not be played Theresa May: ""I have voted consistently in Parliament for us to leave the European Union."" Theresa May has said she hopes the UK will leave the EU well before the new 31 October Brexit deadline. She told MPs there was no reason the UK could not leave in a matter of weeks once MPs backed an agreement, which they have so far rejected three times. She signalled she hoped to get Labour backing for any new customs proposal before putting it to Parliament again. She said their aims were ""very similar"" and ""sometimes people use different terms to mean the same thing"". Labour wants the PM to sign up to the idea of a customs union with the EU, something she has adamantly opposed up to now, and some have suggested she is moving in their direction. Most Conservative MPs have said they would not support the move, saying it would mean the UK would not have an independent trade policy. Mrs May chose to open talks with Jeremy Corbyn after Parliament rejected the withdrawal agreement she has negotiated with the EU a third time late last month. After this defeat, the EU extended the deadline for the UK's departure - originally set for 29 March - until 31 October. Live: May answers MPs Brexit questions Scrapped Brexit ferry deals to cost millions Mrs May told MPs she hoped the extension would be ""terminable"" well before this date and the UK would find itself outside the EU ""as soon as possible"". Appearing before the Liaison Committee of senior MPs, she said the choice facing Parliament was the same as when it last rejected her agreement. MPs could opt to agree a deal and leave in an orderly fashion, to leave without a deal, hold another referendum, or to stay in the EU by revoking Article 50 - only the first of which she found ""acceptable"". She said she was ""convinced"" that reaching out to Labour to try and build a majority for any deal was the right thing to do. If no agreement was reached, she said the government would stand by its commitment to give MPs the chance to vote on a series of options, with ministers abiding by the outcome. Pressed by Labour MP Hilary Benn on whether this would include a customs union, Mrs May pointed out that Parliament had already rejected the idea on more than one occasion. But she added: ""Various terms are used in relation to customs. Sometimes people use different terms to mean the same thing, sometimes it is meaning different approaches. ""But what I think is important when we comes to that process is that anything we put before the House, I hope would would be able to get agreement with the opposition so there is a process that everyone can stand behind."" Asked whether she was prepared to soften her opposition to a customs union, she said both sides needs to ""identify"" what they were trying to achieve. On the issue of post-Brexit trade, she said the government and Labour had ""very similar"" objectives, which were to protect jobs and to ensure as frictionless as trade as possible. But Labour MP Yvette Cooper said MPs felt ""they were going around in circles and paralysed like nothing is changing"". Conservative MP Bernard Jenkin, who voted against the deal three times, said the PM had been under no obligation to agree the terms of the extension offered by the EU. In response, she told him that if all Conservatives had voted to leave the EU the UK would no longer be a member. While the UK's policy was to leave with a deal, she insisted this was ""not entirely in the hands of the UK government"" as it would be up to the EU to decide on any further extension.

"Julian Assange jailed over bail breachThe Wikileaks co-founder deliberately put himself out of reach by hiding in the Ecuadorian embassy, a judge says.","Julian Assange pumped his fist at photographers as he arrived at Southwark Crown Court ahead of the hearing Wikileaks co-founder Julian Assange has been sentenced to 50 weeks in jail for breaching his bail conditions. The 47-year-old was found guilty of breaching the Bail Act last month after his arrest at the Ecuadorian Embassy. He took refuge in the London embassy in 2012 to avoid extradition to Sweden over sexual assault allegations, which he has denied. In a letter read to the court, Assange said he had found himself ""struggling with difficult circumstances"". He apologised to those who ""consider I've disrespected them"", a packed Southwark Crown Court heard. ""I did what I thought at the time was the best or perhaps the only thing that I could have done,"" he said. In mitigation, Mark Summers QC said his client was ""gripped"" by fears of rendition to the US over the years because of his work with whistle-blowing website Wikileaks. ""As threats rained down on him from America, they overshadowed everything,"" he said. Profile: Julian Assange Timeline: Julian Assange saga How likely is an Assange conviction in US? Sentencing him, Judge Deborah Taylor told Assange it was difficult to envisage a more serious example of the offence. ""By hiding in the embassy you deliberately put yourself out of reach, while remaining in the UK,"" she said. She said this had ""undoubtedly"" affected the progress of the Swedish proceedings. His continued residence at the embassy and bringing him to justice had cost taxpayers Â£16m, she added. ""Whilst you may have had fears as to what may happen to you, nonetheless you had a choice, and the course of action you chose was to commit this offence,"" she concluded. As Assange was taken down to the cells, he raised a fist in defiance to his supporters in the public gallery behind him. They raised their fists in solidarity and directed shouts of ""shame on you"" towards the court. Speaking outside court, Wikileaks editor-in-chief Kristinn Hrafnsson said the sentence was an ""outrage"". The extradition process was now the ""big fight"" and would be ""a question of life and death"" for Assange, he said. ""It's also a question of life and death for a major journalist principle,"" he told reporters. I apologise unreservedly to those who consider that I have disrespected them by the way I have pursued my case. This is not what I wanted or intended. I found myself struggling with terrifying circumstances for which neither I nor those from whom I sought advice could work out any remedy. I did what I thought at the time was the best and perhaps the only thing that could be done - which I hoped might lead to a legal resolution being reached between Ecuador and Sweden that would protect me from the worst of my fears. I regret the course that this took; the difficulties were instead compounded and impacted upon very many others. Whilst the difficulties I now face may have become even greater, nevertheless it is right for me to say this now. Assange now faces US federal conspiracy charges related to one of the largest leaks of government secrets. The UK will decide whether to extradite Assange to the US in response to allegations that he conspired with former US intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning to download classified databases. He faces up to five years in a US prison if convicted. Wikileaks has published thousands of classified documents covering everything from the film industry to national security and war. By BBC correspondent Andy Moore, at Southwark Crown Court As Julian Assange arrived at court from Belmarsh High Security prison, photographers got a picture of him defiantly pumping his fist. He's still got a beard but it's been trimmed - it's not the white, bushy beard he was wearing when he was hauled out of the Ecuadorean Embassy last month. There's big international interest, and more than a dozen TV cameras outside. Journalists had to queue for two hours before the case opened to get a ticket to Court Number One, or to an overflow court where there was a videolink to the live proceedings.

This video can not be played Video footage shows Julian Assange being dragged from the Ecuadorian embassy Australian-born Assange was dramatically arrested by UK police on 11 April after Ecuador abruptly withdrew its asylum. At a court hearing that same day, he was remanded in custody and called a ""narcissist who cannot get beyond his own selfish interest"" by district judge Michael Snow. Days later, Swedish prosecutors said they were considering reopening the investigation into rape and sexual assault allegations against him. At the time, Assange said he had had entirely consensual sex with two women while on a trip to Stockholm to give a lecture. Prosecutors dropped the rape investigation in 2017 because they were unable to formally notify him of allegations while he was staying in the embassy. Two other charges of molestation and unlawful coercion had to be dropped in 2015 because time had run out.

The BBC found images and videos on social media of the bodies of fighters and civilians being desecrated by fighters from the self-styled Libyan National Army. The force, led by strongman General Khalifa Haftar, controls a swathe of territory in the east of Libya and is trying to seize the capital, Tripoli. Under international law the desecration of bodies and posting the images online for propaganda is a war crime. The Foreign Office says it takes the allegations extremely seriously and is concerned about the impact the recent violence is having on the civilian population.

Scouts delivered Tory election leafletsThe group's leader quits but says the decision was not made for political or financial reasons.,"The leaflets contained information on Conservative candidates Daniel McNally and Paul Rickett for the East Lindsey District Council elections A scout leader has resigned after getting children in his troop to deliver election leaflets on behalf of two Tory council candidates. The group leader and other volunteers in Lincolnshire, quit after a complaint was made, the Scout Association said. According to theGrimsby Telegraph,external, the scouts were used by Daniel McNally and Paul Rickett in return for a year's use of allotment space to grow vegetables. Mr Rickett said it was ""nothing more than an innocent decision on my part"". The newspaper reported Matt Whall, leader of the Marshchapel scout group, near Grimsby, had apologised in a message posted on the village's Facebook page, saying he had not done it for financial gain but had ""hoped to run a soup kitchen for the community using veg grown in the village"". ""I did not ask the scouts to distribute leaflets for political gain or promotion but did something purely with the motive to provide an enriching opportunity for the young people in the group,"" he added. Mr Rickett, a candidate in the East Lindsey District Council election, said: ""It is regrettable that, what was, in reality, local community minded people trying to help each other out, has taken on a political dimension. ""This was never my intention. Asking the scouts to help me leaflet around Marshchapel for me was nothing more that an innocent decision on my part."" The Scout Association said it was ""clear this was a genuine error"" and the leader's resignation prompted other group leaders to quit, but did not disclose how many had left. ""Members of the movement in uniform, or individuals when acting as representatives of the movement, must not take part in any party political meetings or activities that endorse any particular political party or candidate,"" a spokesman said. Quiz: How well do you know the local elections? Councillors get panic alarms amid threats What happens when councils change hands? The Marshchapel scout group would continue to operate and volunteers were working to ""minimise the impact to the young people"" in the club, the spokesman added. Mr McNally and the Conservative Party have been approached for a comment. The candidates standing for election to East Lindsey District Council in the Marshchapel & Somercotes ward on Thursday 2 May are: Sandra Dykes - Independent; Trisha Newman - Labour Party; Daniel McNally - Conservative Party; Paul Rickett - Conservative Party.

Murder accused 'killed author for will',"Oxford Crown Court heard Peter Farquhar, 69, was killed by Benjamin Field A church warden murdered a university lecturer and attempted to kill a former headmistress to benefit from their wills, a court has heard. Benjamin Field, 28, and Martyn Smith, 32, are accused of plotting the deaths of Peter Farquhar, 69, and Ann Moore-Martin, 83, in Buckinghamshire. Oxford Crown Court heard Mr Field and Mr Smith persuaded the Maids Moreton residents to change their wills. The pair deny murder and conspiracy to murder. Peter Farquhar lived at the house circled on the left, and Ann Moore-Martin on the right Prosecuting, Oliver Saxby QC said Mr Field's ""project"" was to befriend a vulnerable person, get them to change their will and then ""make sure they died"". He told the court Mr Field and Mr Smith murdered Mr Farquhar, who died in October 2015, and conspired to murder Miss Moore-Martin - who later died from natural causes in May 2017. Mr Farquhar and Miss Moore-Martin lived three doors away from each other. Mr Saxby said: ""The motive was financial gain - laced, as far as Benjamin Field is concerned, with a profound fascination in controlling and manipulating and humiliating and killing."" He said the church warden devised what he called ""exit strategies"" to use drugs and alcohol to make deaths look accidental. ""If he was to inherit their houses, they had to die. And if he was to enjoy his inheritance, he had to get away with it,"" he said. Peter Farquhar was a guest lecturer at the University of Buckingham and had written a number of books The court heard the church warden ""relished"" his ""project"" and documented various stages in notes and diaries. Mr Saxby told the jury Mr Field killed Mr Farquhar ""almost certainly by suffocating him"". He said Mr Field ""tried to kill"" Miss Moore-Martin but his plan ""was cut short"" when her niece became involved. Mr Saxby said Mr Smith, a magician, assisted Mr Field in his plan because ""he was greedy"". Peter Farquhar changed his will so Benjamin Field would inherit his home, pictured Mr Field also burgled the homes of elderly people and planned to deceive a 101-year-old woman, the jury heard. The court heard Mr Field's brother, Tom, defrauded Miss Moore-Martin by ""deceiving her"" into giving Benjamin Field Â£27,000 which she believed was for a dialysis machine he needed to survive. Mr Saxby said Tom Field ""pretended to be extremely ill"" when he met Miss Moore-Martin. Benjamin Field, of Wellingborough Road, Olney, Buckinghamshire, denies murder, conspiracy to murder, possessing an article for the use in fraud and an alternative charge of attempted murder. He has admitted four charges of fraud and two of burglary. Mr Smith, of Penhalvean, Redruth, Cornwall, denies murder, conspiracy to murder, two charges of fraud and one of burglary. Tom Field, of Wellingborough Road, Olney, Buckinghamshire, denied a single charge of fraud. The trial continues.

Scrapped Brexit ferry deals to cost millions,"This video can not be played Chris Grayling says the contracts were part of a no-deal 'insurance policy'. The Department for Transport is cancelling contracts to provide extra ferry services after Brexit. Ending the contracts with Brittany Ferries and DFDS could cost the taxpayer more than Â£50m. The government bought Â£89m worth of capacity from the two firms. Some of that capacity might be sold, but millions of pounds could be lost. The contracts were designed to ease pressure on the port of Dover, by creating extra services at other ports. In February, the DfT was forced to axe its Â£13.8m contract with a third company, Seaborne Freight, which the BBC found had never sailed a vessel. P&O sues UK government over no-deal Brexit ferry case Eurotunnel challenges 'secretive' Brexit ferry deals Brexit: Seaborne Freight no-deal ferry contract scrapped Earlier this year, the National Audit Office estimated that the cancellation costs of all the ferry contracts would be Â£56.6m. The cost is likely to only be several million pounds less than this. A government spokesperson said: ""The termination of these contracts has resulted in less cost to the taxpayer than the termination costs reported by the NAO."" The government was also forced to pay Â£33m to Eurotunnel, to settle a case which challenged the procurement process for the ferry contracts. In addition, the DfT is now facing legal action from P&O Ferries, which says its rival, Eurotunnel, was given a competitive advantage by the government. Brittany Ferries is one of the suppliers which had a contract to provide extra ferry services Mr Grayling, the Transport Secretary, said the cancelled contracts were part of a Â£4bn no-deal ""insurance policy"" the government had put in place. ""People would expect a responsible government to take out an insurance policy, and that's what we've done, to make sure we can deal with all the challenges in a no-deal Brexit. ""We never wanted it, we never worked for it, but we sure as certain needed to be ready for it,"" he said. If extra cross-Channel freight services are needed again in the run-up to the new Brexit deadline in October, the government could have to negotiate a new set of contracts, he said. Labour shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald said the contracts will be ""a case study in ministerial incompetence"" on the part of Mr Grayling. ""The Transport Secretary's approach to procurement and planning has cost taxpayers tens, if not, hundreds of millions of pounds. His career as a minister has left a trail of scorched earth and billions of pounds of public money wasted. ""This country cannot afford Chris Grayling.""

"May seeks EU exit well before October deadlineTheresa May says her aims are ""very similar"" to Labour's when it comes to customs talks.","This video can not be played Theresa May: ""I have voted consistently in Parliament for us to leave the European Union."" Theresa May has said she hopes the UK will leave the EU well before the new 31 October Brexit deadline. She told MPs there was no reason the UK could not leave in a matter of weeks once MPs backed an agreement, which they have so far rejected three times. She signalled she hoped to get Labour backing for any new customs proposal before putting it to Parliament again. She said their aims were ""very similar"" and ""sometimes people use different terms to mean the same thing"". Labour wants the PM to sign up to the idea of a customs union with the EU, something she has adamantly opposed up to now, and some have suggested she is moving in their direction. Most Conservative MPs have said they would not support the move, saying it would mean the UK would not have an independent trade policy. Mrs May chose to open talks with Jeremy Corbyn after Parliament rejected the withdrawal agreement she has negotiated with the EU a third time late last month. After this defeat, the EU extended the deadline for the UK's departure - originally set for 29 March - until 31 October. Live: May answers MPs Brexit questions Scrapped Brexit ferry deals to cost millions Mrs May told MPs she hoped the extension would be ""terminable"" well before this date and the UK would find itself outside the EU ""as soon as possible"". Appearing before the Liaison Committee of senior MPs, she said the choice facing Parliament was the same as when it last rejected her agreement. MPs could opt to agree a deal and leave in an orderly fashion, to leave without a deal, hold another referendum, or to stay in the EU by revoking Article 50 - only the first of which she found ""acceptable"". She said she was ""convinced"" that reaching out to Labour to try and build a majority for any deal was the right thing to do. If no agreement was reached, she said the government would stand by its commitment to give MPs the chance to vote on a series of options, with ministers abiding by the outcome. Pressed by Labour MP Hilary Benn on whether this would include a customs union, Mrs May pointed out that Parliament had already rejected the idea on more than one occasion. But she added: ""Various terms are used in relation to customs. Sometimes people use different terms to mean the same thing, sometimes it is meaning different approaches. ""But what I think is important when we comes to that process is that anything we put before the House, I hope would would be able to get agreement with the opposition so there is a process that everyone can stand behind."" Asked whether she was prepared to soften her opposition to a customs union, she said both sides needs to ""identify"" what they were trying to achieve. On the issue of post-Brexit trade, she said the government and Labour had ""very similar"" objectives, which were to protect jobs and to ensure as frictionless as trade as possible. But Labour MP Yvette Cooper said MPs felt ""they were going around in circles and paralysed like nothing is changing"". Conservative MP Bernard Jenkin, who voted against the deal three times, said the PM had been under no obligation to agree the terms of the extension offered by the EU. In response, she told him that if all Conservatives had voted to leave the EU the UK would no longer be a member. While the UK's policy was to leave with a deal, she insisted this was ""not entirely in the hands of the UK government"" as it would be up to the EU to decide on any further extension.

Victim condemns rapist's bankruptcy move,"Stephen Coxen had denied the rape charges against him and the case was found not proven in a criminal court A woman who successfully sued a man for raping her has said she is ""shocked"" but ""not surprised"" that he has declared himself bankrupt. Last October a sheriff ruled that Stephen Coxen had raped the woman after a night out in Fife in 2013 and ordered him to pay her Â£80,000. The case was unusual because Mr Coxen had previously faced a criminal trial but the case was found not proven. Stephen Coxen, 25, declared himself bankrupt in February. The woman, a former St Andrews University student who cannot be named for legal reasons, said she was raped after a night out in the town by Mr Coxen, whom she had met earlier in the evening. The victim was a student at the University of St Andrews Mr Coxen, from Bury in Greater Manchester, had denied the charges, claiming the sex was consensual. The case was found not proven, which means in legal terms that he was cleared, after a criminal trial in November 2015. Woman wins Â£80k damages after rape civil case Should the not proven verdict be scrapped? The woman, known as Miss M, later took out a civil action against Stephen Coxen, which was heard at the Personal Injury Court in Edinburgh. Speaking to BBC Radio'sGood Morning Scotlandprogramme, the woman said her main focus had been gaining justice in the case and not money. She said: ""Initially, the day I found out I was very shocked. I wasn't surprised. ""I think a little part of me always thought he might do this. He was the man that raped me, he is the man I've spent five years fighting against and I think it's just highlighting the type of person that he is. ""But I don't think people should just think about this as terrible that he's made himself bankrupt, because really, I've never wanted to go after him for money. ""The whole point of my whole process - my whole fight over the years is really just for a sheriff to say 'you know he did rape you - this did happen'."" Damages were awarded at the Personal Injury Court in Edinburgh Civil cases require a lower standard of proof than criminal cases, with judgements made on the balance of probabilities rather than beyond reasonable doubt. In this case - understood to be the first of its kind in Scotland -  the sheriff in the civil court ruled Mr Coxen raped the woman despite the not proven verdict in the criminal court, and demanded he pay damages. Sheriff Robert Weir said the evidence from Miss M had been ""cogent, compelling and persuasive"". He said that Mr Coxen took advantage of the 18-year-old student when she was incapable of giving meaningful consent because of the effects of alcohol. David Robertson (left) and David Goodwillie faced a civil action after a decision not to prosecute them The sheriff said Miss M had been distressed and had resisted, but Mr Coxen had continued to rape her. Mr Coxen, who was also aged 18 at the time, denied rape and said they had consensual sex. In 2017, another woman, Denise Clair,won a civil case against footballers David Goodwillie and David Robertson. But the case was different as Ms Clair, who waived her right to anonymity, brought the civil action after the Crown had decided against prosecuting the pair in the criminal courts. The judge in the civil court found the rapes had happened and awarded Ms Clair Â£100,000 damages from the men.

Campaigners lose Heathrow runway challenge,"Campaigners have lost a High Court challenge against the government's decision to approve plans for a third runway at London's Heathrow airport. Five councils, residents, environmental charities and London Mayor Sadiq Khan brought the action after MPs backed the plans in June. The campaigners said the runway would effectively create a ""new airport"", having a ""severe"" impact on Londoners. But judges rejected the arguments, ruling the plans were lawful. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said: ""The expansion of Heathrow is vital and will provide a massive economic boost to businesses and communities across the length and breadth of Britain, all at no cost to the taxpayer and within our environmental obligations. Heathrow plan 'will be like third airport' Heathrow consults on airspace changes ""I now call on all public bodies not to waste any more taxpayers' money or seek to further delay this vital project."" But John Sauven, executive director of Greenpeace UK, said: ""This verdict will not reduce the impact on local communities from increased noise and air pollution, nor will it resolve Heathrow Ltd's financial difficulties or the economic weakness in their expansion plans."" Shirley Rodrigues, deputy London mayor for environment and energy, said: ""In challenging the decision to expand Heathrow, Sadiq has stood up for Londoners who have serious concerns about the damaging impact it will have. ""We will now consider the judgement and consult with our co-claimants before deciding our next steps."" Campaigners said a third runway would effectively create a ""new airport"" The case was brought against the transport secretary by five local authorities in London affected by the expansion - Hillingdon, Wandsworth, Richmond, Hammersmith & Fulham and Windsor and Maidenhead. Residents and charities including Greenpeace, Friends Of The Earth and Plan B also joined the action. They argued that the government's National Policy Statement (NPS), setting out its support for the project, failed to account fully for the impact on air quality, climate change, noise and congestion. Outlining the case on behalf of campaigners, Nigel Pleming QC had said the plans could see the number of passengers using the airport rise to an estimated 132 million - an increase of 60%. But lawyers representing Mr Grayling said the claimants' case was ""premature"", as they would have the opportunity to make representations at a later stage in the planning process. Lord Justice Hickinbottom, sitting with Mr Justice Holgate, said in the ruling on Wednesday: ""We understand that these claims involve underlying issues upon which the parties - and indeed many members of the public - hold strong and sincere views. ""There was a tendency for the substance of the parties' positions to take more of a centre stage than perhaps it should have done, in a hearing that was only concerned with the legality, and not the merits, of the Airports National Policy Statement."" The ruling means the government will not have to devise a new NPS and put it to another vote in Parliament. It won its first vote by a comfortable majority of 296 after Labour MPs were granted a free vote. The decision to expand Heathrow follows almost half a century of indecision on how and where to add new airport capacity in south-east England. Under the current Â£14bn plan, construction could begin in 2021, with the third runway operational by 2026.

Has new alcohol law changed drinking habits?,"This video can not be played Have drinking habits changed? The Nine spoke to a variety of people one year on from the introduction of minimum pricing Ministers are hopeful that new statistics will show Scotland's drinking habits have changed after a new law pushed up the price of cheap, high-strength alcohol. It is a year since the introduction of a minimum price for drinks depending on how many alcohol units they contained. Public Health Minister Joe Fitzpatrick said he was proud that the government had implemented the measure. He was hopeful figures would show there had been a ""positive impact"". There were 1,235 alcohol-related deaths in Scotland in 2017 and almost 35,500 hospital admissions. The Scottish government introduced minimum unit pricing in May last year in a bid to cut consumption and save lives. Scotland calls time on cheap booze Why is alcohol getting more expensive? New pricing law could see spirits rise by Â£3 Mr Fitzpatrick said: ""I'm really proud to be part of the government that introduced minimum unit pricing - the first in the world."" He told BBC Scotland that new data on the effect of the policy was due to be published in mid-June. ""I'm very hopeful that this will show that there has been a positive impact,"" he said. ""Anecdotally I'm hearing from a number of people who have changed their drinking habits and there's some anecdotal evidence to suggest that when the evidence comes out in June, it will be positive."" BBC Scotland's The Ninehas spoken to people around the country about how they have been affected by the new drinking laws. Conor, Rebecca and James are studying in Dundee First-year anatomy student Conor, 18, reckons he drinks about 20 units a week - mostly lager. He supports minimum unit pricing but it has had little effect on his drinking habits. In fact, he drinks more than he did last year as he has embraced his new university life. ""You're young, you drink and I don't think that will ever change, no matter what law you put in place,"" he said. Rebecca, 21, is in her third year of an international business degree. She ""pre-drinks"" gin with friends before going to bars and clubs, as she finds it more affordable. ""I don't think it's affected me too much,"" she said. ""It's affected more own brands and I wouldn't tend to buy them anyway."" Meanwhile, engineering student James, 21, said he had seen his friends switch from drinking cheap cider to ""better quality"" drinks. ""It's cut out the really cheap and unhealthy stuff, it's made that less of an option,"" he said. ""Obviously it's there if you really want to drink it but why would you when you can pay the same amount for better-quality alcohol?"" Sachin Patel has seen an increase in profits at his shop in Muirkirk Sachin Patel no longer sells Frosty Jacks cider in his shop in Muirkirk, Ayrshire, after its price rose from about Â£3.50 to about Â£11.50. Customers refused to pay the increased price, instead opting for fruit ciders or even spirits. Mr Patel said he could now match the prices offered by supermarkets, which used to sell spirits as ""loss leaders"" to entice customers into the store. A bottle of Glens vodka used to be Â£9.99 - now he sells it at minimum unit price of Â£13.13. ""Because of that our profit margin is increased,"" he said. ""That works better for us as retailers even if the volume we sell is less, the margin is greater."" He has concerns that the new law has led to an increase in violence against retailers. ""If someone wants alcohol, they're going to beg, borrow or steal,"" he said. ""The retailers are taking the brunt."" But he is generally in favour of the policy. ""For us, it protects the retailers.

"Victim condemns rapist's bankruptcy moveStephen Coxen had been ordered to pay his victim Â£80,000 in damages after he was sued for rape in the civil courts.","Stephen Coxen had denied the rape charges against him and the case was found not proven in a criminal court A woman who successfully sued a man for raping her has said she is ""shocked"" but ""not surprised"" that he has declared himself bankrupt. Last October a sheriff ruled that Stephen Coxen had raped the woman after a night out in Fife in 2013 and ordered him to pay her Â£80,000. The case was unusual because Mr Coxen had previously faced a criminal trial but the case was found not proven. Stephen Coxen, 25, declared himself bankrupt in February. The woman, a former St Andrews University student who cannot be named for legal reasons, said she was raped after a night out in the town by Mr Coxen, whom she had met earlier in the evening. The victim was a student at the University of St Andrews Mr Coxen, from Bury in Greater Manchester, had denied the charges, claiming the sex was consensual. The case was found not proven, which means in legal terms that he was cleared, after a criminal trial in November 2015. Woman wins Â£80k damages after rape civil case Should the not proven verdict be scrapped? The woman, known as Miss M, later took out a civil action against Stephen Coxen, which was heard at the Personal Injury Court in Edinburgh. Speaking to BBC Radio'sGood Morning Scotlandprogramme, the woman said her main focus had been gaining justice in the case and not money. She said: ""Initially, the day I found out I was very shocked. I wasn't surprised. ""I think a little part of me always thought he might do this. He was the man that raped me, he is the man I've spent five years fighting against and I think it's just highlighting the type of person that he is. ""But I don't think people should just think about this as terrible that he's made himself bankrupt, because really, I've never wanted to go after him for money. ""The whole point of my whole process - my whole fight over the years is really just for a sheriff to say 'you know he did rape you - this did happen'."" Damages were awarded at the Personal Injury Court in Edinburgh Civil cases require a lower standard of proof than criminal cases, with judgements made on the balance of probabilities rather than beyond reasonable doubt. In this case - understood to be the first of its kind in Scotland -  the sheriff in the civil court ruled Mr Coxen raped the woman despite the not proven verdict in the criminal court, and demanded he pay damages. Sheriff Robert Weir said the evidence from Miss M had been ""cogent, compelling and persuasive"". He said that Mr Coxen took advantage of the 18-year-old student when she was incapable of giving meaningful consent because of the effects of alcohol. David Robertson (left) and David Goodwillie faced a civil action after a decision not to prosecute them The sheriff said Miss M had been distressed and had resisted, but Mr Coxen had continued to rape her. Mr Coxen, who was also aged 18 at the time, denied rape and said they had consensual sex. In 2017, another woman, Denise Clair,won a civil case against footballers David Goodwillie and David Robertson. But the case was different as Ms Clair, who waived her right to anonymity, brought the civil action after the Crown had decided against prosecuting the pair in the criminal courts. The judge in the civil court found the rapes had happened and awarded Ms Clair Â£100,000 damages from the men.

Corbyn: UK must declare a climate emergency,"Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has opened a parliamentary debate, calling on MPs to declare a national climate emergency on climate change. Shadow business secretary Rebecca Long Bailey said this is ""the first step towards taking more radical action"". Labour is also calling on the government to commit to achieving net zero emissions before 2050. The UK is currently committed to reducing carbon emissions by 80% compared to 1990 levels by 2050. The debate in Parliamentcomes after a series of protests bythe environmental activists Extinction Rebellion. The groupdescribed a meetingwith Environment Secretary Michael Gove on Tuesday as ""very disappointing"" because he refused to declare a climate emergency. Mr Gove said he ""shared their high ideals"" to tackle climate change but added that ""we should show that we're making a difference rather than simply telling everyone how important it is to change"". Is Greta Thunberg right about UK climate claims? Climate change: Where we are in seven charts Talk to our climate change bot TheWelshandScottishgovernments have both declared a climate emergency, along with dozens of towns and cities, including Manchester and London. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme Ms Long Bailey said Labour wanted the government to establish a target for net zero emissions ""well before"" 2050. She also called for ""a green industrial revolution"" to ""harness the huge economic potential that low carbon and renewable technology will bring"" such as onshore and offshore wind and tidal technology. ""This isn't just about tackling climate change it is a huge economic opportunity to rebuild Britain,"" she said. Thousands of Scottish school pupils took part in climate protests last month Dozens of towns and cities across the UK have already declared ""a climate emergency"". There is no single definition of what that means but many local areas say they want to be carbon-neutral by 2030. Some councils have promised to introduce electric car hubs or build sustainable homes to try to achieve that goal. It's a much more ambitious target than the UK government's, which is to reduce carbon emissions by 80% (compared to 1990 levels) by 2050. Read more here By Roger Harrabin, Environment Analyst What would it mean to acknowledge a climate emergency or climate crisis? Well, it would put the climate at centre stage of government policy. For years politicians have devised fine policies on the environment, only to see them fail as other issues jostled to the political fore. The UK for instance is legally committed to long-term climate change targets - but it's already slipping away from its medium-term goals. Transport and agriculture are especially culpable. Environmentalists say it's inconceivable that any government caring about the climate thinks expanding Heathrow is compatible with cutting emissions. In terms of how the government is run under an emergency scenario - it would have to move towards the equivalent of a war footing. This sounds melodramatic, but it would mean that cutting greenhouse gas emissions becomes a central goal of the UK's economic policy, with all governments taking responsibility - not just the Business Department and Defra. This, according to Professor Jim Watson from the UK Energy Research Centre, means a central role for the Treasury. It would monitoring emissions as closely as we monitor GDP growth and employment, and ensure that all government decisions are compatible with a net zero pathway. Declaring an emergency or a climate crisis could have psychological advantages too: If we keep repeating a phrase it tends to become reality in our minds. That would help keep the climate at the forefront of decision-making. There are problem with the emergency definition, though. First, is the slow relentless nature of climate change itself. Can we see climate change as an emergency in the way we accept that, say a flu pandemic is an emergency? Then there's the timescale. From 1939-1945, a state of emergency won the war. But that was six years of toil and sweatâ¦ not 32 years as we struggle towards our 2050 date for eliminating emissions.

SNP MP Wishart to stand for Speaker,"Pete Wishart said he would release a ""substantial and far-reaching"" manifesto SNP MP Pete Wishart has announced his candidacy to replace John Bercow as the Speaker of the House of Commons. There is speculation Mr Bercow will announce his retirement this summer, although he has not yet confirmed this. Conservative MP Sir Edward Leigh and Labour's Chris Bryant have both voiced an interest in the job. Mr Wishart wrote on Twitter that he would release a manifesto on Wednesday to become ""the first post-war Speaker from beyond the two main parties"". Has the race to replace John Bercow begun? The Speaker of the House of Commons is in charge of selecting MPs to speak and keeping order during debates. The position is filled via a secret ballot of members. The position is traditionally seen as an impartial role, and the Speaker is expected to resign from their party. Mr Bercow has been in the job since June 2009, and was re-elected unopposed after the 2015 and 2017 elections. There isspeculation that he will announce his retirementthis summer - although he has not spoken about his plans publicly, always insisting he would tell MPs first. Allow Twitter content?

Labour MP Chris Bryant was one of the first to declare an interest in the job, saying the next Speaker should focus on ""tending to the wounds"" caused by Brexit rows and harassment scandals. Sir Edward - who has represented Gainsborough since 1983 - said he would be a ""traditional speaker"" who did not speak very much. Mr Wishart - who chairs the Scottish affairs select committee - meanwhile said his candidacy would be ""based on a solid agenda of reform seeking to secure equality of all MPs"", saying his manifesto would be ""substantial and far-reaching"". His announcement prompted criticism from some independence supporters online, who told Mr Wishart that SNP members should be at Westminster to ""settle up, not settle down"". But his party leader, Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, defended the move, saying: ""For as long as the SNP is in the House of Commons, we should be trying to make it work as well as we can, and undo some of the barriers that are in the way - we've seen all too powerfully in the Brexit debate how Scotland's voice is not being heard."" There have also been calls for the next speaker to be a woman, with Labour's Gloria de Piero and Tory Nicky Morgan saying ina joint article in the Times,externalthat electing another man to the post would be a ""setback"" and a ""missed opportunity"".

LiveMPs question May over Brexit2 minutes ago,"Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson sacked after probe into National Security Council leak In a statement, PM says she has lost confidence in his ability to serve in the cabinet Mr Williamson ""strenuously"" denies leaking the information The Daily Telegraph reported the NSC agreed to let Chinese firm Huawei help build UK's 5G network He will be replaced as defence secretary by International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt Penny Mordaunt will be replaced by current Prisons Minister Rory Stewart Earlier: Theresa May questioned about Brexit by the Commons Liaison Committee At Prime Minister's Questions, Jeremy Corbyn challenged PM on social mobility record Thanks for joining us for reaction to the sacking of Gavin Williamson as defence secretary - that's where we will leave our live updates for this evening. His departure follows an inquiry into a leak from a top-level National Security Council meeting, over a plan to allow Huawei limited access to help build the UK's new 5G network. He has been replaced by Penny Mordaunt, who will become the UK's first female defence secretary. Mr Williamson has ""strenuously"" denied leaking information from the meeting, but the PM said ""no other credible version of events"" has been found to explain the leak. Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson and Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable have both said they think the police should get involved in the matter. But Scotland Yard said in a statement that it was a matter for the National Security Council and the Cabinet Office, and it was not carrying out an investigation. BBC News Channel Gavin
Williamsonâs denial over being behind the leak from a top-level National
Security Council meeting is âextraordinaryâ, a security think tank says. Prof Michael Clarke, from the Royal United Services Institute, says
Mr Williamson has implied that the investigation was ânot formal or thoroughâ
which is a direct criticism of those who conducted the inquiry. He adds: âGavin Williamson is going down fighting
and heâs maintaining, in effect, that theyâve got the wrong man. âThatâs extraordinary â for a senior minister to be in that
position.â BBC News Channel Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable says Gavin Williamson's sacking is ""absolutely extraordinary"". He says he agrees with Labour deputy leader Tom Watson that ""this is clearly a police matter"". ""The Metropolitan Police are going to have to get involved as quickly as possible"".

Laura KuenssbergBBC political editor Downing Street has made a very serious accusation and is sure enough to carry out this sacking. For the prime minister's allies, it will show that she is, despite the political turmoil, still strong enough to move some of her ministers around - to hire and fire. Mr Williamson is strenuously still denying that the leak was anything to do with him at all. There is nothing fond, or anything conciliatory, in either the letter from the prime minister to him, or his reply back to her. Read more here. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt says the prime minister had no alternative but to sack Gavin Williamson as defence secretary. Speaking as he arrived in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, Mr Hunt said: ""On a personal level I'm very sorry about what happened for Gavin's sake but given the gravity of the situation there was no other alternative outcome."" Labourâs deputy leader Tom Watson has called for a police inquiry to investigate whether or not Gavin Williamson breached the Official Secrets Act. âItâs the most brutal sacking letter of any minister Iâve seen in my lifetimeâ he said. âThe magnitude of the allegation against him is very serious.â He said that it was a crime to breach the Official Secrets Act, but acknowledged that Mr Williamson strenuously denies the allegation. âHe denies it â he deserves to have his voice heard.â The way to do that is to hold a âcriminal inquiryâ he added, which he said he believed should âgo ahead rapidly.â The new international development secretary tweets...

""At this time, we're not carrying out an investigation. ""Clearly if at any stage we receive any information that would suggest criminal offences have been committed, then we will look into that."" Penny Mordaunt's appointment as the new defence secretary follows a term serving as the International Development Secretary. Ms Mordant has a background as a naval reservist and previously served as the armed forces minister under David Cameron.

She campaigned for a Leave vote in the 2016 EU referendum. Downing Street has played down talk of a possible prosecution over the leak from a top-level National Security Council meeting. Theresa May's official spokesman told a Westminster briefing: ""It is not for the government to determine prosecutions, but the prime minister has said, from her point of view, that she considers the matter to be closed."" Mrs May met Mr Williamson in her Commons office for half an hour after receiving a briefing on the leak inquiry in the early afternoon. Labour MP tweets...  Allow Twitter content?

'Toxic culture' blamed for maternity issues,"Owen Smith's Pontypridd constituency includes the Royal Glamorgan Hospital A Labour MP has accused Welsh ministers of being partly to blame for failings in Cwm Taf maternity services. An independent review said units at Royal Glamorgan and Prince Charles hospitals were""dysfunctional"" and mothers' worries were often ignored. Pontypridd MP Owen Smith said issues seem to have been ""compounded"" by big service changes. Health Minister Vaughan Gething has said he was ""determined"" to see improvements delivered. Mr Smith said Welsh Government needs ""to look at itself about the way that decision was driven through"". Mr Gethingput Cwm Taf maternity services into special measureson Tuesday, meaning it will face increased scrutiny. Both Welsh Conservatives and Plaid Cymru called on him to resign over the issue. Plaid has also laid a motion of no confidence in Mr Gething, which will be debated next week, saying the ""distressing"" report into Cwm Taf was ""part of a wider pattern of failing"". Baby death mum 'scared' of using hospital Q&A: Cwm Taf maternity problems Mums 'ignored and made to feel worthless' Party health spokeswoman Helen Mary Jones kept up the pressure on Mr Gething in the assembly. ""I'm just really concerned that this is suggesting that we have a minister who doesn't really have a grip on the system,"" she said. ""Eight reports over six years and nothing was done, until you called for a report years ago. ""During those years, children died. Mothers were traumatised and families were traumatised."" Prince Charles Hospital now has an expanded special care baby unit and six en-suite delivery rooms Mr Smith told BBC Wales said: ""I don't think we can forget the fact that part of the issue here is that there was a massive reorganisation of services. ""I and many other local politicians opposed it at the time, saying that amongst other things it wasn't necessarily going to solve the problem that it was meant to solve, i.e. difficulty in recruiting midwives. ""That seems to have been compounded by the reorganisation. ""The Welsh Government needs to look at itself about the way that decision was driven through in the light of significant local opposition and the way in which once the decision had been taken it was left to the health board to, sort of, clean up the mess."" When asked about calls for Mr Gething to resign, Mr Smith said he had spoken to him earlier in the week and was reassured he was on top of the situation. Earlier, Paul Davies, leader of the Welsh Conservatives, called for Mr Gething and health board leaders to quit. Mr Gething said: ""I am far from complacent about my responsibilities, not only in the sense of the whole performance of the service, not just the challenges but the good that the service does, but my responsibility to see through the improvement that I recognise is plainly required and [I'm] determined to see delivered."" This video can not be played 'We picked the wrong day to be ill' The chairman of the health board blamed a ""toxic"" culture for problems highlighted in the review. Prof Marcus Longley told BBC Radio Wales'Good Morning Walesprogramme that the review's findings had ""sent a shock through the entire organisation"". ""Apologies are empty words if they aren't faced by action,"" he said. ""We have got some complex issues here that have built up over time. Clearly we have failed in our task."" He highlighted one issue raised in the report that ""doctors and midwives do not work as a unified team all of the time"". ""That is a really serious issue,"" he said. ""That has built up over many years. It has become custom and practice to work in the wrong way. ""It's not because we have got wicked or incompetent doctors or midwives at all. ""It's because those cultures, those working practices are developed which are toxic and we now need to unpack that."" This video can not be played Jessica Western says she is still fighting to find out why her daughter Macie died Des Kitto, chief officer of the board of Community Health Councils (CHC) in Wales and former chief officer for patient watchdog Cwm Taf CHC, said the review was ""sickening to the stomach"". He said the CHC raised concerns about the number of stillbirths and undertook unannounced visits but ""didn't seem to get any results"", so their concerns were escalated to regulators Health Inspectorate Wales which led to the Welsh Government involvement. ""Trust has been lost. It has got to be action now from the health board, and not words."" He also said he was unhappy the CHC was not made aware of an internal report by a consultant midwife, produced in September. The independent review criticised Cwm Taf for sitting on it. ""I don't think we had the full story,"" said Mr Kitto. ""I don't think there was an attempt to mislead, but patients have been let down and the responsibility goes back to the whole board - we should be looking at how they can rebuild the necessary trust."" What does special measures mean for Cwm Taf maternity services? Health organisations are rated regularly by Welsh Government, Wales Audit Office and Healthcare Inspectorate Wales, who decide if they need extra support. There are four levels of intervention - and the most serious is special measures. Cwm Taf Morgannwg's maternity units are now at that scale, while the whole health board has also been upgraded to a targeted intervention status. Mr Longley said there was now an ""enormous amount going on"" internally to deal with the 70 recommendations in the review and this was now the health board's ""top priority"". He has not put a deadline on the work ahead and believes a number of root causes will take a long time to put right. Meanwhile, an independent panel will oversee an existing review into 43 cases involving mothers and babies and it has been recommended that this review will also stretch back to examine many more cases stretching back to 2010. Analysis  - Owain Clarke, BBC Wales health correspondent With its maternity services in special measures, Cwm Taf Morgannwg will not be left to its own devices and will be monitored at every stage. Some improvements are already in place, but the issues are so varied and deep-rooted it could take months or even years before maternity services are up to scratch and sticking plaster solutions certainly won't be enough. When I spoke to Marcus Longley, its chairman, he said there was a ""chill"" when the full scale of the problems emerged, but the issues stretched back a number of years and there was no easy fix. What's clear, although the health board insist they are safe, maternity services face a long road to recovery and it could take even longer to rebuild public trust. The tremors of the independent review will be felt for some time. Looking further afield, the Welsh Government insist there is no evidence of similar problems elsewhere, yet we know the watchdog Health Inspectorate Wales will be shortly undertaking a review of care for mothers and babies across the country.

Campaigners lose Heathrow runway challengeHigh Court judges rule in favour of the government's decision to approve airport expansion plans.BusinessComments,"Campaigners have lost a High Court challenge against the government's decision to approve plans for a third runway at London's Heathrow airport. Five councils, residents, environmental charities and London Mayor Sadiq Khan brought the action after MPs backed the plans in June. The campaigners said the runway would effectively create a ""new airport"", having a ""severe"" impact on Londoners. But judges rejected the arguments, ruling the plans were lawful. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said: ""The expansion of Heathrow is vital and will provide a massive economic boost to businesses and communities across the length and breadth of Britain, all at no cost to the taxpayer and within our environmental obligations. Heathrow plan 'will be like third airport' Heathrow consults on airspace changes ""I now call on all public bodies not to waste any more taxpayers' money or seek to further delay this vital project."" But John Sauven, executive director of Greenpeace UK, said: ""This verdict will not reduce the impact on local communities from increased noise and air pollution, nor will it resolve Heathrow Ltd's financial difficulties or the economic weakness in their expansion plans."" Shirley Rodrigues, deputy London mayor for environment and energy, said: ""In challenging the decision to expand Heathrow, Sadiq has stood up for Londoners who have serious concerns about the damaging impact it will have. ""We will now consider the judgement and consult with our co-claimants before deciding our next steps."" Campaigners said a third runway would effectively create a ""new airport"" The case was brought against the transport secretary by five local authorities in London affected by the expansion - Hillingdon, Wandsworth, Richmond, Hammersmith & Fulham and Windsor and Maidenhead. Residents and charities including Greenpeace, Friends Of The Earth and Plan B also joined the action. They argued that the government's National Policy Statement (NPS), setting out its support for the project, failed to account fully for the impact on air quality, climate change, noise and congestion. Outlining the case on behalf of campaigners, Nigel Pleming QC had said the plans could see the number of passengers using the airport rise to an estimated 132 million - an increase of 60%. But lawyers representing Mr Grayling said the claimants' case was ""premature"", as they would have the opportunity to make representations at a later stage in the planning process. Lord Justice Hickinbottom, sitting with Mr Justice Holgate, said in the ruling on Wednesday: ""We understand that these claims involve underlying issues upon which the parties - and indeed many members of the public - hold strong and sincere views. ""There was a tendency for the substance of the parties' positions to take more of a centre stage than perhaps it should have done, in a hearing that was only concerned with the legality, and not the merits, of the Airports National Policy Statement."" The ruling means the government will not have to devise a new NPS and put it to another vote in Parliament. It won its first vote by a comfortable majority of 296 after Labour MPs were granted a free vote. The decision to expand Heathrow follows almost half a century of indecision on how and where to add new airport capacity in south-east England. Under the current Â£14bn plan, construction could begin in 2021, with the third runway operational by 2026.

He has been replaced by Penny Mordaunt, who will become the UK's first female defence secretary. Mr Williamson has ""strenuously"" denied leaking information from the meeting, but the PM said ""no other credible version of events"" has been found to explain the leak.

Laura KuenssbergBBC political editor Downing Street has made a very serious accusation and is sure enough to carry out this sacking. For the prime minister's allies, it will show that she is, despite the political turmoil, still strong enough to move some of her ministers around - to hire and fire. Mr Williamson is strenuously still denying that the leak was anything to do with him at all. There is nothing fond, or anything conciliatory, in either the letter from the prime minister to him, or his reply back to her. Read more here. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt says the prime minister had no alternative but to sack Gavin Williamson as defence secretary. Speaking as he arrived in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, Mr Hunt said: ""On a personal level I'm very sorry about what happened for Gavin's sake but given the gravity of the situation there was no other alternative outcome."" Labourâs deputy leader Tom Watson has called for a police inquiry to investigate whether or not Gavin Williamson breached the Official Secrets Act. âItâs the most brutal sacking letter of any minister Iâve seen in my lifetimeâ he said. âThe magnitude of the allegation against him is very serious.â He said that it was a crime to breach the Official Secrets Act, but acknowledged that Mr Williamson strenuously denies the allegation. âHe denies it â he deserves to have his voice heard.â The way to do that is to hold a âcriminal inquiryâ he added, which he said he believed should âgo ahead rapidly.â The new international development secretary tweets...

""At this time, we're not carrying out an investigation. ""Clearly if at any stage we receive any information that would suggest criminal offences have been committed, then we will look into that.""

"Free ATMs 'vanishing at alarming rate'More than 1,700 cash machines started charging a fee in the UK between January and March this year.","Free-to-use cash machines have been disappearing at a rapid rate across the UK, according to a study by Which? Nearly 1,700 machines started charging for withdrawals in the first three months of the year, with the majority starting to charge in March, according to the consumer lobby group. Cardtronics, which runs most of those, and fellow provider NoteMachine are both likely to charge at more machines. That could mean the country losing 13% of its free ATMs in only a few months. The changes come aftera reduction in the fee operators receive from banks each time an ATM is used. Link, which oversees ATMs, began to cut the fee, known as the interchange rate, last year. So far it has reduced the charge from 25p to 23p per withdrawal. Link said at the time that the move was aimed at protecting the ATM network. It left the fee for free-to-use ATMs - which are 1km or more from the next nearest cash machine - unchanged. Ashleigh Cooper from Hebden Bridge in West Yorkshire has seen the number of cash machines dwindle from six down to two. Mr Cooper, aged 60, said:  ""It causes real problems especially on bank holidays. There are no banks here anymore. We have a mobile bank that visits every few weeks but that's no good to me. ""Hebden Bridge is quite a touristy area and there's usually a problem with one of the cash machines going out of order because it's run out of cash. ""The local cinema here was always a cash business but they're now having to accept digital payments or lose punters. ""For me it's like going back to the dark ages, it's crazy."" ATM operators receive the interchange fee from banks each time one of their cash machines is used. Pay by cash? Not for long, report warns Battle to save remote cash machines Free cash machines closing at record rate Free cash machine network under scrutiny NoteMachine, which operates 7,000 cash machines across the UK, said the cut in the interchange rate meant it was considering introducing fees at up to 4,000 of its machines. ""Unless urgent action is taken to reduce the pressure on ATM operators by reversing the interchange fee reductions, NoteMachine will be forced to begin converting ATMs to surcharging,"" said chief executive Peter McNamara. Rival ATM machine operator Cardtronics has said it is likely to convert another 1,000 of its ATMs over the coming months. It said it ""had been forced into charging a fee for cash withdrawals on some of our machines where Link's cuts have left us with no choice"". There were about 52,000 free cash machines in the country at the start of the year. Gareth Shaw, head of money at Which?, said: ""Communities are being stripped of free access to cash at an alarming rate that could hit the most vulnerable in our society the hardest, while denying millions of people free withdrawals. ""A regulator is desperately needed to get a grip of these rapid changes across the cash landscape and ensure all those still reliant on this important payment method aren't suddenly shut out from accessing the cash they need in their daily lives."" Reported charges range from 50p to Â£1.99 and the situation angered some of the respondents to the Which? survey. Anita Brakewell, from Blackpool, said: ""Being disabled means I don't have the option of walking to the next free cash machine, so these charges shut me out of cash that's important to my daily life. ""My town has also suffered from bank branch closures, making it hard to access the cash and financial services I need."" And Robin Farnsworth, from Kirkcaldy, said: ""I stopped using the local cashpoint when it started charging me just to access my cash. I'm on a very tight budget and can't afford to be spending out just to get the money I need for everyday life."" Bank of England figures show that 2.2 million people are almost entirely reliant on cash. And last year'sAccess to Cash study, published in December, found that more than eight million people would struggle to cope in a cashless society, which would present real challenges for 25 million UK residents. However, cash use has halved in the past 10 years and in 2017, debit cards overtook notes and coins as the UK's most popular payment method. There is a fierce, three-way, struggle going on over the future of our network of free-to-use cash machines. The upstarts are independent operators like Cardtronics and Note Machine which now have the most ATMs. Then there are the banks. They have to pay the operators each time their customers use a non-bank machine. Finally, we have Link which runs the network and has been trying to get the operators to accept lower payments from the banks. Two cuts to the payments have been pushed through, prompting Cardtronics to say it is being ""forced"" to charge the customer instead. And the backdrop is that we are using less cash, which means fewer withdrawals and less chance that a cash machine will pay its way. So it's not clear where this will end. But more charging will cause anger and frustration amongst those who depend heavily on cash. Pay by cash?

Laura KuenssbergBBC political editor Downing Street has made a very serious accusation and is sure enough to carry out this sacking. For the prime minister's allies, it will show that she is, despite the political turmoil, still strong enough to move some of her ministers around - to hire and fire. Mr Williamson is strenuously still denying that the leak was anything to do with him at all. There is nothing fond, or anything conciliatory, in either the letter from the prime minister to him, or his reply back to her. Read more here. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt says the prime minister had no alternative but to sack Gavin Williamson as defence secretary. Speaking as he arrived in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, Mr Hunt said: ""On a personal level I'm very sorry about what happened for Gavin's sake but given the gravity of the situation there was no other alternative outcome."" Labourâs deputy leader Tom Watson has called for a police inquiry to investigate whether or not Gavin Williamson breached the Official Secrets Act. âItâs the most brutal sacking letter of any minister Iâve seen in my lifetimeâ he said. âThe magnitude of the allegation against him is very serious.â He said that it was a crime to breach the Official Secrets Act, but acknowledged that Mr Williamson strenuously denies the allegation. âHe denies it â he deserves to have his voice heard.â The way to do that is to hold a âcriminal inquiryâ he added, which he said he believed should âgo ahead rapidly.â The new international development secretary tweets...

Scotland Yard says it is not carrying out an investigation into the leak from a top-level National Security Council meeting. In a statement, it said: ""We're aware of the media reports in relation to the leak and that is a matter for the National Security Council and the Cabinet Office to look at. ""At this time, we're not carrying out an investigation. ""Clearly if at any stage we receive any information that would suggest criminal offences have been committed, then we will look into that."" Penny Mordaunt's appointment as the new defence secretary follows a term serving as the International Development Secretary. Ms Mordant has a background as a naval reservist and previously served as the armed forces minister under David Cameron. The daughter of a paratrooper and a special needs teacher, she is probably best known outside Westminster for her appearance on ITV's celebrity diving show Splash! to raise money for charity. She campaigned for a Leave vote in the 2016 EU referendum. Downing Street has played down talk of a possible prosecution over the leak from a top-level National Security Council meeting. Theresa May's official spokesman told a Westminster briefing: ""It is not for the government to determine prosecutions, but the prime minister has said, from her point of view, that she considers the matter to be closed."" Mrs May met Mr Williamson in her Commons office for half an hour after receiving a briefing on the leak inquiry in the early afternoon. Labour MP tweets...  Allow Twitter content?

What to look out for in the local elections,"On Thursday 2 May, voters will head to the polls across England for local elections. The elections will decide who runs local authorities across the country and could be an important test of public and political opinion for Theresa May, Jeremy Corbyn and the other party leaders. There are 343 councils in England. They provide a wide range of services, depending on their shape and size. These include housing, road maintenance, parking, rubbish collection, leisure and cultural facilities, school funding and admissions, environmental health, planning and social services. The largest local authorities are also responsible for adult social care and children's services. Councillors are elected to sit on these councils and represent people in a specific geographical area for a fixed term of four years. They decide on the overall direction of policy, which is implemented on a day-to-day basis by non-elected council officials. This video can not be played Local elections: What are they all about? Elections take place in four-year cycles, with different councils holding elections in different years. This time around, elections are taking place in 248 councils, with 8,425 seats up for grabs and about 25,000 people standing.   By-elections can take place in some council wards even if that council is not scheduled for elections this year. Check your council website for details. The vast majority of England's smaller district councils are holding elections. Nearly 120 of these are electing a full slate of councillors while a smaller number are choosing only a third. There are 30 of England's larger unitary authorities, such as Bedford, Stoke-on-Trent, Redcar and Cleveland and York, which are electing all their councillors while a smaller number are choosing a third. In addition, the majority of England's 36 metropolitan borough councils - including cities such as Manchester, Liverpool and Newcastle Upon Tyne - are electing a third of their representatives. There are no polls in Birmingham this year while the only elections in London are by-elections for two wards in Lewisham and Havering borough councils. Voters will not be heading to the polls in Cornwall while there are no elections in any of England's 26 ""shire"" county councils. However, many of England's 8,000 parish and community councils will elect representatives to make decisions on planning applications, amenities and other issues on behalf of their local villages and towns. According to the Electoral Reform Society, there are about 150 council wards where there is only one candidate who will be elected unopposed. Voters will also be going to the polls in Northern Ireland to elect 462 councillors across 11 council areas. There are no local elections this year in Wales or Scotland. 30 unitary authorities will be contested in their entirety - including Bedford, Brighton, Stoke, Redcar and York If you are registered to vote, you will be able to take part in Thursday's elections. If there is an election in your area, you should have already received a polling card, giving details of your nearest polling station. You should take this with you when you go to vote, although in most places you will be able to vote without it. Polling stations open at 07.00 BST and close at 22.00 BST. The deadline for registering has passed so if you are not on the electoral register, you will not be able to vote. To find out whether you are registered, contact your local Electoral Registration Office viathe gov.uk website.,external If you live in certain parts of the country, you will need to take ID with you when you vote - as part of an ongoing government trial to tackle voter fraud. InBroxtowe,external,Craven,external,Derby,external,North Kesteven,externalandBraintree,external, voters will have to show either one piece of photo ID or two forms of non-photo ID. InMid Sussex,external,Watford,externalandNorth West Leicestershire,external, people will have to bring their polling cards or photo ID. Voters inPendle,externalandWoking,externalwill only be able to show photo ID at the polling station to be given a ballot paper. Parties are said to run, or have control, of a council if they have more seats than all their opponents combined. If no party has a majority, a council is said to be under no overall control. Those parties with the most seats are referred to as being the largest party and can strike deals with others, such as independents, to run the local authority. According to the Local Government Information Unit,citing House of Commons library figures,external, 56% of councils are currently under Tory control, Labour run 28% while the Lib Dems control 3%. The remaining 12% are under no overall control. This video can not be played Council elections: Why don't two-thirds of people vote? In most cases, these seats were last contested in 2015, on the same day as that year's general election, in which the Conservatives won a majority in Parliament. A lot has changed since then, of course. The Conservatives are defending the largest number of seats, with 4,906 Tory councillors up for re-election, compared with 2,113 for Labour. The Liberal Democrats have 647 seats to defend, UKIP 176 and the Green Party 71. There are also 512 seats held by independents being fought. There will be a battle royal in Brighton where, after a series of Labour defections and by-elections, the Conservatives are now the largest party. The Green Party - which used to run the council between 2011 and 2015 - is also looking to boost its presence. In Cheshire West and Chester the council is on a knife-edge with both Labour and the Conservatives fighting to be the largest party. Milton Keynes, Bolton, Calderdale and Blackpool may also switch hands, or the ruling party could lose its majority and surrender overall control. The Conservatives did relatively well in 2015 and the pressure will be on Theresa May this time Many voters will be motivated by purely local issues. But Brexit remains the dominant political subject and the polls will be a big test for Theresa May, who is under growing pressure from her MPs and activists angered by delays to the UK's departure from the EU. Labour's performance, as ever, will be closely watched to see if it is making progress in those areas needed to win a general election. The Lib Dems and Green Party will be hoping to do well on the back of their anti-Brexit, anti-austerity messages. UKIP is fielding about 1,400 candidates but the newly launched Brexit Party is focusing its attention on the European elections while new centrist party Change UK did not register in time to put up candidates. The race to be the first area to declare its result is not quite as intense as on general election night. But expect the first results to come in between midnight and 01.00 am on Friday, with St Helens, Sunderland, Swindon and North Tyneside among those vying to be the quickest. The busiest time is set to be between 02.00 and 04.00 BST, when results will start flooding in from across England, including Oldham, Plymouth, Portsmouth, Stockport, Liverpool and Trafford. However, some local authorities won't begin counting their votes until 09.00 am on Friday. Manchester is expected to declare at 15.00 BST, Brighton and York at 17.00 BST and Cheshire West and Chester at 19.00 BST. Yes, there are six mayoral contests taking place, in Bedford, Copeland, Leicester, Mansfield, Middlesbrough and a Metro Mayor for North of Tyne.

Mums 'ignored and made to feel worthless',"This video can not be played Jessica Western says she is still fighting to find out why her daughter Macie died The full extent of the problems with maternity services at two hospitals in the south Wales valleys rings out when the voices of women and families are listened to. ""Overwhelmingly"" mothers faced ""distressing experiences and poor care"", the review team found. As one said: ""I want having a baby to be a good experience. It's ruined it."" Women repeatedly stated they were not listened to and their concerns were not taken seriously or valued. They spoke of being ignored or patronisedwhile being cared for at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital in Llantrisant and Prince Charles Hospital in Merthyr Tydfil. Often, their suspicions and concerns were found to have reflected a genuine problem that emerged later, but at the time they were dismissed when they tried to voice their concerns. Amajor independent reviewhas found Cwm Taf health board's maternity services were ""under extreme pressure"" and the health minister has ordered them be put into special measures. It was prompted by 25 serious incidents, including eight stillbirths and four neonatal deaths, between January 2016 and last September. The independent review team has releaseda separate, damning 78-page report,,externalwhich shares the views of 140 family members, including mothers about their experiences at the hospitals. Nearly two thirds of women questioned felt they had not had good quality care during their pregnancy. Cwm Taf maternity services put in special measures Gething rejects quit call over Cwm Taf Q&A: What's the background at Cwm Taf? The review said: ""Many women had felt something was wrong with their baby or tried to convey the level of pain they were experiencing but they were ignored or patronised, and no action was taken, with tragic outcomes including stillbirth and neonatal death of their babies."" One woman said she felt worthless, adding: ""I'm broken from the whole experience, the lack of care and compassion."" On the care itself, repeatedly the review team heard from mothers who did not always believe the right level of skills and expertise were available at the right time. There was a failure to seek a second, more senior opinion, and to escalate concerns, especially with women with complex pregnancies. One mother said: ""He told me there was no point calling the consultant on a Sunday as no one would come."" Another said: ""I never saw the same consultant. They didn't know me, and they didn't want to know me. I was pushed in and out of rooms with all sorts of people."" Mothers faced too many variables in the service offered - from the time of day they used it, to staffing levels and the communication skills of the staff they met. This video can not be played 'We picked the wrong day to be ill' The case of Sarah Handy Sarah Handy's experience is highlighted in the report as illustrating a number of serious issues. In pain, she was begging to see a doctor when she arrived in hospital in April 2017 and was left for nearly three hours without examination before being told it was constipation. Ms Handy, 33, was sent back home to Merthyr Tydfil with laxatives and pain relief and that evening her baby Jennifer was delivered prematurely by her husband and mother-in-law. Despite their efforts to give CPR to save her life, Jennifer died. The review said it showed: Inadequate levels of expertise in managing high risk pregnancies Failure to listen to women and to understand the level of pain being experienced and reported Lack of response to ""red flags"" and failure to follow good practice and pathways of care Failure to call for a second, more senior, opinion Failure to support the woman after the tragic and traumatic loss of her baby. Ms Handy said after the report came out: ""Today it's been proven in black and white that we were right to highlight our concerns and push for further investigation into our Jennifer's death. ""We just wish that this report will now do what it promised and improve the quality of care so that no other family has to go the traumatic experience we went through."" On communication, although individual staff were spoken of as excellent, many women felt during their care this aspect was extremely poor. When concerns were raised, there was a ""significant dissatisfaction"" with how they were dealt with, with dismissive attitudes. Many women were not listened to or taken seriously, one saying she was ""laughed at"" when she expressed concern. Other responses included: ""I was never asked, never believed. ""If only they had asked the right questions. ""Most importantly, we were not listened to. By the time we were it was too late."" The review said women reported an ""almost callous and brutal use of language"" and disregard for feelings. Cwm Taf told to 'get back on track' 26 baby deaths in maternity probe When one mother was concerned that she may be losing her baby she was told to ""prepare for the worst - it could be a miscarriage"" and then told to go home as ""there wasn't a lot she could do."" Younger mothers in particular often felt their concerns were dismissed, which became an ""emerging theme"" for the review team. There were failures to apologise, lack of access to notes and comprehensive investigations over concerns. With high risk pregnancies, one woman interviewed believed that there was a lack of expertise and that ""anything different from the norm, they didn't seem set up to deal with it"". Another described the antenatal clinic as being ""like a cattle-market"". When babies were lost, ""many women and families received no bereavement counselling or support and continue to experience emotional distress"". But staffing shortages were recognised. One mother talking about the demand on midwives and doctors in the Royal Glamorgan Hospital, said it was ""no way a reflection on them"". ""They would always spend as much time as possible with me but unfortunately when needs must I was left with some questions but again this was due to staff shortages,"" she said. Another said: ""There were so many jobs for one midwife to do and then people wonder why mistakes get made. They are human and are exhausted"". The review published two parallel reports into Cwm Taf maternity services and the experiences of mothers The review team said it was disappointing that lessons had not been learnt from a review of Furness General Hospital services four years ago. Prof Jean White, chief nursing officer, said: ""It should be a joyous occasion giving birth to a child. Many of the women who shared their stories had care well below the standards we expect and that's not right. ""I think over time there appears to be a culture that has developed rather than an open culture where people are encouraged to say what's gone wrong, there is a blame culture."" In the words of another parent: ""Listen to women and families and believe what they tell you when they are in pain."" The review team concludes: ""The strong message heard from women and families in Cwm Taf is that they don't want their experiences to happen to anyone else and the importance to them that the organisation learns from these experiences to ensure that improvement and change occurs."" Cwm Taf chief executive Allison Williams said she was deeply sorry, is taking the findings very seriously but recognised ""significant work"" was still needed. ""Some of the feedback we have received from patients is extremely distressing and their experience in our maternity service has been totally unacceptable,"" she added.

Beavers given protected status in ScotlandThe new legislation makes it illegal to kill beavers or destroy established dams without a licence.,"This video can not be played Scottish beavers protected in law Wildlife organisations have welcomed new legislation making beavers a protected species in Scotland. It is now illegal to kill beavers or destroy established dams and lodges without a licence. The Scottish Wildlife Trust said legal protection for beavers was ""an important step"" to enable the species to ""expand its range."" Farming leadershave raised concernsabout the damage caused to agricultural land from beavers' dam-building. The animalswere reintroduced to Scotland's waterwaysa decade ago. There are currently about 450 beavers in Scotland, in Tayside and mid-Argyll. Scottish Wildlife Trust chief executive Jo Pike said beavers were ""unrivalled as ecosystem engineers."" She said: ""Granting beavers protected status is an important milestone for the return of the species to Scotland's lochs and rivers. ""It follows decades of work by countless organisations and individuals to demonstrate the positive impacts that beavers can have. Ms Pike said the trust accepted that land managers must have the ability to deal with ""localised negative impacts"" caused by beavers. She said: ""However, it is equally important to ensure lethal control is only used as a last resort, and this does not threaten the successful spread of beavers into other areas of Scotland."" Farmer Adrian Ivory said beaver dams cost his business thousands of pounds every year Adrian Ivory is farm manager at Strathisla Farms in Perthshire. Last year beavers set up home close to his wheat field. He told the BBC that the beavers damming on a nearby burn resulted in his crop being destroyed. He said: ""The big problem for us with the dams is that it costs me as a business Â£4,000-Â£5,000 a year, pulling dams out of watercourses, trying to sort banks out. ""These are problems that we shouldn't really be having to deal with. ""We are trying to produce quality food for the population to eat and this is just causing real problems and a cost to my business.""

Free ATMs 'vanishing at alarming rate',"Free-to-use cash machines have been disappearing at a rapid rate across the UK, according to a study by Which? Nearly 1,700 machines started charging for withdrawals in the first three months of the year, with the majority starting to charge in March, according to the consumer lobby group. Cardtronics, which runs most of those, and fellow provider NoteMachine are both likely to charge at more machines. That could mean the country losing 13% of its free ATMs in only a few months. The changes come aftera reduction in the fee operators receive from banks each time an ATM is used. Link, which oversees ATMs, began to cut the fee, known as the interchange rate, last year. So far it has reduced the charge from 25p to 23p per withdrawal. Link said at the time that the move was aimed at protecting the ATM network. It left the fee for free-to-use ATMs - which are 1km or more from the next nearest cash machine - unchanged. Ashleigh Cooper from Hebden Bridge in West Yorkshire has seen the number of cash machines dwindle from six down to two. Mr Cooper, aged 60, said:  ""It causes real problems especially on bank holidays. There are no banks here anymore. We have a mobile bank that visits every few weeks but that's no good to me. ""Hebden Bridge is quite a touristy area and there's usually a problem with one of the cash machines going out of order because it's run out of cash. ""The local cinema here was always a cash business but they're now having to accept digital payments or lose punters. ""For me it's like going back to the dark ages, it's crazy."" ATM operators receive the interchange fee from banks each time one of their cash machines is used. Pay by cash? Not for long, report warns Battle to save remote cash machines Free cash machines closing at record rate Free cash machine network under scrutiny NoteMachine, which operates 7,000 cash machines across the UK, said the cut in the interchange rate meant it was considering introducing fees at up to 4,000 of its machines. ""Unless urgent action is taken to reduce the pressure on ATM operators by reversing the interchange fee reductions, NoteMachine will be forced to begin converting ATMs to surcharging,"" said chief executive Peter McNamara. Rival ATM machine operator Cardtronics has said it is likely to convert another 1,000 of its ATMs over the coming months. It said it ""had been forced into charging a fee for cash withdrawals on some of our machines where Link's cuts have left us with no choice"". There were about 52,000 free cash machines in the country at the start of the year. Gareth Shaw, head of money at Which?, said: ""Communities are being stripped of free access to cash at an alarming rate that could hit the most vulnerable in our society the hardest, while denying millions of people free withdrawals. ""A regulator is desperately needed to get a grip of these rapid changes across the cash landscape and ensure all those still reliant on this important payment method aren't suddenly shut out from accessing the cash they need in their daily lives."" Reported charges range from 50p to Â£1.99 and the situation angered some of the respondents to the Which? survey. Anita Brakewell, from Blackpool, said: ""Being disabled means I don't have the option of walking to the next free cash machine, so these charges shut me out of cash that's important to my daily life. ""My town has also suffered from bank branch closures, making it hard to access the cash and financial services I need."" And Robin Farnsworth, from Kirkcaldy, said: ""I stopped using the local cashpoint when it started charging me just to access my cash. I'm on a very tight budget and can't afford to be spending out just to get the money I need for everyday life."" Bank of England figures show that 2.2 million people are almost entirely reliant on cash. And last year'sAccess to Cash study, published in December, found that more than eight million people would struggle to cope in a cashless society, which would present real challenges for 25 million UK residents. However, cash use has halved in the past 10 years and in 2017, debit cards overtook notes and coins as the UK's most popular payment method. There is a fierce, three-way, struggle going on over the future of our network of free-to-use cash machines. The upstarts are independent operators like Cardtronics and Note Machine which now have the most ATMs. Then there are the banks. They have to pay the operators each time their customers use a non-bank machine. Finally, we have Link which runs the network and has been trying to get the operators to accept lower payments from the banks. Two cuts to the payments have been pushed through, prompting Cardtronics to say it is being ""forced"" to charge the customer instead. And the backdrop is that we are using less cash, which means fewer withdrawals and less chance that a cash machine will pay its way. So it's not clear where this will end. But more charging will cause anger and frustration amongst those who depend heavily on cash. Pay by cash?

His departure follows an inquiry into a leak from a top-level National Security Council meeting, over a plan to allow Huawei limited access to help build the UK's new 5G network. He has been replaced by Penny Mordaunt, who will become the UK's first female defence secretary. Mr Williamson has ""strenuously"" denied leaking information from the meeting, but the PM said ""no other credible version of events"" has been found to explain the leak. Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson and Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable have both said they think the police should get involved in the matter. But Scotland Yard said in a statement that it was a matter for the National Security Council and the Cabinet Office, and it was not carrying out an investigation. BBC News Channel Gavin
Williamsonâs denial over being behind the leak from a top-level National
Security Council meeting is âextraordinaryâ, a security think tank says. Prof Michael Clarke, from the Royal United Services Institute, says
Mr Williamson has implied that the investigation was ânot formal or thoroughâ
which is a direct criticism of those who conducted the inquiry. He adds: âGavin Williamson is going down fighting
and heâs maintaining, in effect, that theyâve got the wrong man. âThatâs extraordinary â for a senior minister to be in that
position.â BBC News Channel Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable says Gavin Williamson's sacking is ""absolutely extraordinary"". He says he agrees with Labour deputy leader Tom Watson that ""this is clearly a police matter"". ""The Metropolitan Police are going to have to get involved as quickly as possible"".

"Corbyn: UK must declare a climate emergencyShadow minister Rebecca Long Bailey said this is ""the first step towards taking more radical action"".UK PoliticsComments","Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has opened a parliamentary debate, calling on MPs to declare a national climate emergency on climate change. Shadow business secretary Rebecca Long Bailey said this is ""the first step towards taking more radical action"". Labour is also calling on the government to commit to achieving net zero emissions before 2050. The UK is currently committed to reducing carbon emissions by 80% compared to 1990 levels by 2050. The debate in Parliamentcomes after a series of protests bythe environmental activists Extinction Rebellion. The groupdescribed a meetingwith Environment Secretary Michael Gove on Tuesday as ""very disappointing"" because he refused to declare a climate emergency. Mr Gove said he ""shared their high ideals"" to tackle climate change but added that ""we should show that we're making a difference rather than simply telling everyone how important it is to change"". Is Greta Thunberg right about UK climate claims? Climate change: Where we are in seven charts Talk to our climate change bot TheWelshandScottishgovernments have both declared a climate emergency, along with dozens of towns and cities, including Manchester and London. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme Ms Long Bailey said Labour wanted the government to establish a target for net zero emissions ""well before"" 2050. She also called for ""a green industrial revolution"" to ""harness the huge economic potential that low carbon and renewable technology will bring"" such as onshore and offshore wind and tidal technology. ""This isn't just about tackling climate change it is a huge economic opportunity to rebuild Britain,"" she said. Thousands of Scottish school pupils took part in climate protests last month Dozens of towns and cities across the UK have already declared ""a climate emergency"". There is no single definition of what that means but many local areas say they want to be carbon-neutral by 2030. Some councils have promised to introduce electric car hubs or build sustainable homes to try to achieve that goal. It's a much more ambitious target than the UK government's, which is to reduce carbon emissions by 80% (compared to 1990 levels) by 2050. Read more here By Roger Harrabin, Environment Analyst What would it mean to acknowledge a climate emergency or climate crisis? Well, it would put the climate at centre stage of government policy. For years politicians have devised fine policies on the environment, only to see them fail as other issues jostled to the political fore. The UK for instance is legally committed to long-term climate change targets - but it's already slipping away from its medium-term goals. Transport and agriculture are especially culpable. Environmentalists say it's inconceivable that any government caring about the climate thinks expanding Heathrow is compatible with cutting emissions. In terms of how the government is run under an emergency scenario - it would have to move towards the equivalent of a war footing. This sounds melodramatic, but it would mean that cutting greenhouse gas emissions becomes a central goal of the UK's economic policy, with all governments taking responsibility - not just the Business Department and Defra. This, according to Professor Jim Watson from the UK Energy Research Centre, means a central role for the Treasury. It would monitoring emissions as closely as we monitor GDP growth and employment, and ensure that all government decisions are compatible with a net zero pathway. Declaring an emergency or a climate crisis could have psychological advantages too: If we keep repeating a phrase it tends to become reality in our minds. That would help keep the climate at the forefront of decision-making. There are problem with the emergency definition, though. First, is the slow relentless nature of climate change itself. Can we see climate change as an emergency in the way we accept that, say a flu pandemic is an emergency? Then there's the timescale. From 1939-1945, a state of emergency won the war. But that was six years of toil and sweatâ¦ not 32 years as we struggle towards our 2050 date for eliminating emissions.

"Victim condemns rapist's bankruptcy moveStephen Coxen had been ordered to pay his victim Â£80,000 in damages after he was sued for rape in the civil courts.Edinburgh, Fife & East Scotland","Stephen Coxen had denied the rape charges against him and the case was found not proven in a criminal court A woman who successfully sued a man for raping her has said she is ""shocked"" but ""not surprised"" that he has declared himself bankrupt. Last October a sheriff ruled that Stephen Coxen had raped the woman after a night out in Fife in 2013 and ordered him to pay her Â£80,000. The case was unusual because Mr Coxen had previously faced a criminal trial but the case was found not proven. Stephen Coxen, 25, declared himself bankrupt in February. The woman, a former St Andrews University student who cannot be named for legal reasons, said she was raped after a night out in the town by Mr Coxen, whom she had met earlier in the evening. The victim was a student at the University of St Andrews Mr Coxen, from Bury in Greater Manchester, had denied the charges, claiming the sex was consensual. The case was found not proven, which means in legal terms that he was cleared, after a criminal trial in November 2015. Woman wins Â£80k damages after rape civil case Should the not proven verdict be scrapped? The woman, known as Miss M, later took out a civil action against Stephen Coxen, which was heard at the Personal Injury Court in Edinburgh. Speaking to BBC Radio'sGood Morning Scotlandprogramme, the woman said her main focus had been gaining justice in the case and not money. She said: ""Initially, the day I found out I was very shocked. I wasn't surprised. ""I think a little part of me always thought he might do this. He was the man that raped me, he is the man I've spent five years fighting against and I think it's just highlighting the type of person that he is. ""But I don't think people should just think about this as terrible that he's made himself bankrupt, because really, I've never wanted to go after him for money. ""The whole point of my whole process - my whole fight over the years is really just for a sheriff to say 'you know he did rape you - this did happen'."" Damages were awarded at the Personal Injury Court in Edinburgh Civil cases require a lower standard of proof than criminal cases, with judgements made on the balance of probabilities rather than beyond reasonable doubt. In this case - understood to be the first of its kind in Scotland -  the sheriff in the civil court ruled Mr Coxen raped the woman despite the not proven verdict in the criminal court, and demanded he pay damages. Sheriff Robert Weir said the evidence from Miss M had been ""cogent, compelling and persuasive"". He said that Mr Coxen took advantage of the 18-year-old student when she was incapable of giving meaningful consent because of the effects of alcohol. David Robertson (left) and David Goodwillie faced a civil action after a decision not to prosecute them The sheriff said Miss M had been distressed and had resisted, but Mr Coxen had continued to rape her. Mr Coxen, who was also aged 18 at the time, denied rape and said they had consensual sex. In 2017, another woman, Denise Clair,won a civil case against footballers David Goodwillie and David Robertson. But the case was different as Ms Clair, who waived her right to anonymity, brought the civil action after the Crown had decided against prosecuting the pair in the criminal courts. The judge in the civil court found the rapes had happened and awarded Ms Clair Â£100,000 damages from the men.

"Mums 'ignored and made to feel worthless'Mothers speaking to the Cwm Taf maternity review ""overwhelmingly"" had distressing experiences.Wales","This video can not be played Jessica Western says she is still fighting to find out why her daughter Macie died The full extent of the problems with maternity services at two hospitals in the south Wales valleys rings out when the voices of women and families are listened to. ""Overwhelmingly"" mothers faced ""distressing experiences and poor care"", the review team found. As one said: ""I want having a baby to be a good experience. It's ruined it."" Women repeatedly stated they were not listened to and their concerns were not taken seriously or valued. They spoke of being ignored or patronisedwhile being cared for at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital in Llantrisant and Prince Charles Hospital in Merthyr Tydfil. Often, their suspicions and concerns were found to have reflected a genuine problem that emerged later, but at the time they were dismissed when they tried to voice their concerns. Amajor independent reviewhas found Cwm Taf health board's maternity services were ""under extreme pressure"" and the health minister has ordered them be put into special measures. It was prompted by 25 serious incidents, including eight stillbirths and four neonatal deaths, between January 2016 and last September. The independent review team has releaseda separate, damning 78-page report,,externalwhich shares the views of 140 family members, including mothers about their experiences at the hospitals. Nearly two thirds of women questioned felt they had not had good quality care during their pregnancy. Cwm Taf maternity services put in special measures Gething rejects quit call over Cwm Taf Q&A: What's the background at Cwm Taf? The review said: ""Many women had felt something was wrong with their baby or tried to convey the level of pain they were experiencing but they were ignored or patronised, and no action was taken, with tragic outcomes including stillbirth and neonatal death of their babies."" One woman said she felt worthless, adding: ""I'm broken from the whole experience, the lack of care and compassion."" On the care itself, repeatedly the review team heard from mothers who did not always believe the right level of skills and expertise were available at the right time. There was a failure to seek a second, more senior opinion, and to escalate concerns, especially with women with complex pregnancies. One mother said: ""He told me there was no point calling the consultant on a Sunday as no one would come."" Another said: ""I never saw the same consultant. They didn't know me, and they didn't want to know me. I was pushed in and out of rooms with all sorts of people."" Mothers faced too many variables in the service offered - from the time of day they used it, to staffing levels and the communication skills of the staff they met. This video can not be played 'We picked the wrong day to be ill' The case of Sarah Handy Sarah Handy's experience is highlighted in the report as illustrating a number of serious issues. In pain, she was begging to see a doctor when she arrived in hospital in April 2017 and was left for nearly three hours without examination before being told it was constipation. Ms Handy, 33, was sent back home to Merthyr Tydfil with laxatives and pain relief and that evening her baby Jennifer was delivered prematurely by her husband and mother-in-law. Despite their efforts to give CPR to save her life, Jennifer died. The review said it showed: Inadequate levels of expertise in managing high risk pregnancies Failure to listen to women and to understand the level of pain being experienced and reported Lack of response to ""red flags"" and failure to follow good practice and pathways of care Failure to call for a second, more senior, opinion Failure to support the woman after the tragic and traumatic loss of her baby. Ms Handy said after the report came out: ""Today it's been proven in black and white that we were right to highlight our concerns and push for further investigation into our Jennifer's death. ""We just wish that this report will now do what it promised and improve the quality of care so that no other family has to go the traumatic experience we went through."" On communication, although individual staff were spoken of as excellent, many women felt during their care this aspect was extremely poor. When concerns were raised, there was a ""significant dissatisfaction"" with how they were dealt with, with dismissive attitudes. Many women were not listened to or taken seriously, one saying she was ""laughed at"" when she expressed concern. Other responses included: ""I was never asked, never believed. ""If only they had asked the right questions. ""Most importantly, we were not listened to. By the time we were it was too late."" The review said women reported an ""almost callous and brutal use of language"" and disregard for feelings. Cwm Taf told to 'get back on track' 26 baby deaths in maternity probe When one mother was concerned that she may be losing her baby she was told to ""prepare for the worst - it could be a miscarriage"" and then told to go home as ""there wasn't a lot she could do."" Younger mothers in particular often felt their concerns were dismissed, which became an ""emerging theme"" for the review team. There were failures to apologise, lack of access to notes and comprehensive investigations over concerns. With high risk pregnancies, one woman interviewed believed that there was a lack of expertise and that ""anything different from the norm, they didn't seem set up to deal with it"". Another described the antenatal clinic as being ""like a cattle-market"". When babies were lost, ""many women and families received no bereavement counselling or support and continue to experience emotional distress"". But staffing shortages were recognised. One mother talking about the demand on midwives and doctors in the Royal Glamorgan Hospital, said it was ""no way a reflection on them"". ""They would always spend as much time as possible with me but unfortunately when needs must I was left with some questions but again this was due to staff shortages,"" she said. Another said: ""There were so many jobs for one midwife to do and then people wonder why mistakes get made. They are human and are exhausted"". The review published two parallel reports into Cwm Taf maternity services and the experiences of mothers The review team said it was disappointing that lessons had not been learnt from a review of Furness General Hospital services four years ago. Prof Jean White, chief nursing officer, said: ""It should be a joyous occasion giving birth to a child. Many of the women who shared their stories had care well below the standards we expect and that's not right. ""I think over time there appears to be a culture that has developed rather than an open culture where people are encouraged to say what's gone wrong, there is a blame culture."" In the words of another parent: ""Listen to women and families and believe what they tell you when they are in pain."" The review team concludes: ""The strong message heard from women and families in Cwm Taf is that they don't want their experiences to happen to anyone else and the importance to them that the organisation learns from these experiences to ensure that improvement and change occurs."" Cwm Taf chief executive Allison Williams said she was deeply sorry, is taking the findings very seriously but recognised ""significant work"" was still needed. ""Some of the feedback we have received from patients is extremely distressing and their experience in our maternity service has been totally unacceptable,"" she added.

Failed Asda bid cost Sainsbury's ÃÂ£46mThe supermarket chain reveals the cost of its failed Asda merger as it reports a slip in sales.BusinessComments,"The failed bid to merge with rival Asda cost Sainsbury's Â£46m, the supermarket giant has said. In April, a proposed merger between Sainsbury's and Asda was blocked by the UK's competition watchdog over fears it would raise prices for consumers. Sainsbury's said that like-for-like sales growth slowed in the fourth quarter, especially over the Christmas period. It added it would accelerate investment in its stores and technology. Fourth-quarter sales fell 0.9%, having fallen 1.1% over Christmas. In the year ending 9 March, profit before tax fell to Â£239m, from Â£409m the previous year. Costs for the year included the failed Asda bid, restructuring costs of Â£81m and defined benefit pension expenses of Â£118m. Retail analyst Steve Dressersaid in a tweet,externalthat the second half of the year was ""poor for Sainsbury's really"", taking into consideration ""Halloween, Christmas, Mother's Day, Valentine's Day, Comic Relief"" and a ""hot summer in first half too"". Sainsbury's chief executive Mike Coupe was not his usual Tiggerish self when presenting this set of results. He gave the impression of someone trying to make the best of a less-than-ideal outcome  - which, of course, he was. In his ideal world, he would have been talking about the final preparations for the merger with Asda, but that was blown out of the water by the Competition and Markets Authority last week. Instead, he was left to describe a fairly mundane set of annual results in glowing terms. They show a company that is fighting hard on all fronts - trying to compete against aggressive low-price rivals and a resurgent Tesco, while at the same time finding the money to improve its stores, reduce debt and maintain dividend payments to shareholders. Once you include restructuring costs and a Â£46m hit on the failed deal with Asda, statutory profits were down one-third to Â£219m - a tiny number for a company that has annual sales of Â£32bn. Sainsbury insiders had warned against expecting a big strategic relaunch, a Plan B after the Asda failure. Shareholders will still be disappointed that there wasn't one, and will no doubt be pressing hard on whether - or rather when - it will emerge. Chief executive Mike Coupe told the BBC's Today programme: ""Well, we draw a line under the past... The authorities blocked the [Asda] deal, but we think our business is adapting to the changing world of retail, and we will will carry on investing in our business."" Mr Coupe said Sainsbury's would invest in 400 supermarkets over the next year and would continue to put money into online sales. The investment will include refurbishment of some big stores, including Hedge End near Southampton. He added that he would be ""sticking to the company"" when questioned about whether he had been asked to step down after the failed merger. On a media call, he said ""I'm planning to stay,"" adding that shareholders and the board had been supportive. Sainsbury's shares took a big tumble in February after a preliminary decision against the merger by the competition watchdog, falling from 287.9p per share to 234.5p over the course of a day. The share price dipped as low as 216p in the last week of April. Laith Khalaf, a senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ""The market's been worried about Sainsbury's ever since the tie-up with Asda fell through, and while underlying performance hasn't been stellar, the supermarket's beaten expectations, and that's provided the share price with a much-needed fillip. ""However, it's a bit premature to pop any champagne corks just yet."" He said one-off costs had led to a ""steep decline"" in reported profits, adding that ""the supermarket's debt pile also looks pretty high, though the good news is the pension scheme has moved into surplus"". Mr Khalaf added: ""Perhaps most concerning is that sales growth is flatlining at best. In some bits of the business, notably clothing and general merchandise, sales are in retreat. Of course, this all contrasts with a resurgent Tesco, which makes Sainsbury's sales performance look pallid by comparison.""

Police probe motorhome fraud claims,"This video can not be played Motorhome owner Alan Nicoll recalls the ""terrible time"" he had during a finance dispute Police are investigating claims that a West Lothian motorhome firm duped customers and business associates out of hundreds of thousands of pounds. BBC Scotland has learned that dozens of Gill's Motorhomes clients are owed substantial sums for vehicle hire bookings that never materialised. Several customers also claim they lost thousands after buying used vehicles that were still owned by finance firms. And two men claim to have lost tens of thousands over a failed franchise plan. Gill's Motorhomes, which has now ceased trading, told BBC Scotland that all of its customers who prepaid to hire a vehicle would receive a full refund. The Dechmont-based company, whose sole director is David Gill, also said it aimed to ""recompense"" two businessmen who each invested close to Â£100,000 in planned Gill's-branded franchise operations in England ""as and when we are able"". In a statement, police said they were ""investigating reports of a fraudulent scheme linked to a business in Dechmont, West Lothian"". Alan Nicoll says he had to pay a finance company Â£10,000 or lose his motorhome BBC Scotland traced a number of Gill's customers, all of whom claimed to have lost thousands of pounds. Alan Nicoll, from East Kilbride, and Fort William-based Ingrid Anderson both bought ex-hire motorhomes from Gill's - only to discover later that the vehicles were still subject to leasing agreements. In October Mr Nicoll, 55, paid Gill's a Â£5,000 deposit for a motorhome before finding out a few days later that there was outstanding finance on the vehicle. He said he agreed to pay Gill's the outstanding balance of Â£32,000 after receiving assurances from the firm that it would clear the debt with the finance company as soon as it received his money. In emails seen by BBC Scotland, Mr Nicoll was repeatedly told by Gill's that the issue was being addressed. But the finance company did not receive the money. In March, it informed Mr Nicoll that Gill's had ceased trading and that it wanted to recover the vehicle. Mr Nicoll said: ""I decided to reach a settlement and paid the finance company Â£10,000. ""Between my partner and myself, it was a terrible time. ""You can understand a business going underneath, but for them to do what they did was just lowlife."" Mrs Anderson shows the receipt for her purchase of a used motorhome Ingrid Anderson, who is in her 60s, told BBC Scotland that she paid Gill's company Motorhome Hire Scotland Â£35,000 for a second-hand Bailey Advance 655 in late 2017. But when she tried to sell it a few months ago, a dealer informed her that there was still a lease agreement on the vehicle. Mrs Anderson claimed she was later told by the finance company involved that she would have to pay an outstanding balance of Â£20,500 or it would repossess the vehicle. She said she tried to resolve the matter with Gill's but the company went silent at the end of February. ""I was devastated when I discovered there was a lease agreement on the motorhome and I could lose it,"" she said. ""My lawyer is currently reviewing the legal position and I have informed the police about my case."" Ingrid Anderson faces a bill of more than Â£20,000 in order to keep her motorhome A statement emailed to the BBC by Gill's Motorhomes read: ""Historically every year since inception we have sold off our ex-hire motorhomes and in the majority of cases we paid off the finance owed on them. ""Regrettably due to a variety of unforeseen circumstances the business was unable to continue trading and as a direct result of those circumstances it rendered it impossible for us to make the final finance payments on three vehicles."" A number of people also came forward to the BBC to say they had lost substantial sums trying to rent motorhomes from Gill's. Derek Burke paid Gill's Â£1,472 upfront after being offered an ""early bird"" rental discount on 23 February. Derek Burke set up an online group for people who lost money after dealing with Gill's Motorhomes Mr Burke, from Burntisland, said he only found out that there might be a problem when he tried to alter the rental dates several weeks later. He told BBC Scotland: ""We tried to contact them (Gill's) several times by phone to rearrange the dates, to see if that was possible but there was no answer on the phone. ""So I emailed them and again there was no answer."" Mr Burke set up an online group and found others with similar accounts of dealings with Gill's. So far more than a dozen have come forward. He said: ""There were several people posting who had booked with Gill's Motorhome Hire Scotland and they couldn't get hold of anyone - the same situation I was in. And they had paid upfront as well. ""There's an awful lot of anger, as you can imagine."" Mr Burke has also approached the police over his case. This page from Gill's Motorhomes was removed several weeks ago Two Spaniards have also claimed to have lost substantial amounts of money in their dealings with Gill's. Xavi Pena, from Barcelona, said that in January he hired a motorhome from Gill's to travel around Scotland with his wife, two-year-old son and parents-in-law. He explained: ""We were asked to pay the full amount of Â£1,800 in order to lock the motorhome. ""That was clearly a mistake from our side, but we were keen to secure it given that my parents-in-law were travelling all the way from Australia, where they live. ""About 10 days before our trip I tried to contact the company again in order to agree on the pick-up location and time but they had vanished completely. ""Their website was not operative, they didn't answer emails or calls. In the end we had to rent another motorhome."" Santi Miralda says the company failed to respond after he tried to amend his booking Santi Miralda, 49, also from Barcelona, said he paid Gill's more than Â£1,500 upfront in February to rent a vehicle. Mr Miralda, who runs a language school in the Spanish city, said alarm bells started ringing when he tried to alter his booking a few weeks later. ""I tried to contact them (Motorhome Hire Scotland) to ask for a change and that was when I realised that I had been ripped off. ""The web page has disappeared and they do not answer any mail or phone calls."" BBC Scotland has established that the Gill's Motorhomes' website went offline in early March, with the message: ""Our site is currently unavailable."" In mid-April, a new message appeared, stating that Gill's Motorhome Hire Ltd had ceased trading. In a statement, Gill's Motorhomes said it took bookings in advance ""like any other motorhome hire company"". It continued: ""All of our customers who prepaid will receive a full refund, indeed most have already. ""Like any other business associated with travel we provided an 'early bird' discount for customers who paid in advance. We have offered this facility since inception in 2015. ""We notified our customers via email as soon as it became clear that we were unfortunately unable to continue trading. ""We provided clear and concise instructions on how our customers could get their money back. Most, if not all, have now successfully followed those instructions."" Chris Nowell, 56, from Stafford, claims he is about Â£90,000 out of pocket after signing a franchise agreement with Gill's Motorhomes last year. He said the fee of Â£75,000, plus VAT, included marketing and website costs involved in renting out Gills-branded vehicles in Birmingham from 1 April. Chris Nowell says he has lost about Â£90,000 over the franchise agreement with Gill's Mr Nowell, who is a former director of JCB, told the BBC that he had concerns back in February about how the franchise was proceeding and began a legal process of withdrawing from the agreement. However, on 1 March he received an email from Gill's saying that it had ceased trading. He says he has not received a penny of his money back. He told BBC Scotland: ""I feel that essentially I have been duped into taking on the franchise. ""I feel it was never a properly established franchise, and they weren't in a position to deliver what they promised when they started. ""I have lost so far a great deal of money but I also feel awful for the other people, particularly the people who were booking through the Gill's website for Birmingham where I was due to open a franchise. ""They've lost their holidays and they've lost, in some cases, their bookings."" Another ""franchisee"", Alan Amos, says he paid out about Â£100,000 late last year to take on a Gill's Motorhome hire franchise in Swindon. He also claims to have received nothing back from Gill's. He told BBC Scotland: ""I have to pay off a Â£50,000 loan and will have to sell off my house and downsize. I've also got to find a job. ""I can't figure out where all the money has gone. I have been stressed out in a way I have never been before."" In a statement, Gill's said: ""Two people progressed their intentions to proceed with our franchise model and they had invested funds in that regard. ""We had a very strong and sustainable franchise model which had been scrutinised by many industry professionals including representatives for both individuals concerned. ""A substantial investment was made by ourselves in our franchise model but very regrettably we were unable to sustain the costs associated with this business due to unforeseen circumstances. ""We are deeply disappointed with what has happened and we aim to recompense these people as and when we are able."" A Police Scotland spokeswoman said: ""We are investigating reports of a fraudulent scheme linked to a business in Dechmont, West Lothian. ""Inquiries are ongoing.""

Laith Khalaf, a senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ""The market's been worried about Sainsbury's ever since the tie-up with Asda fell through, and while underlying performance hasn't been stellar, the supermarket's beaten expectations, and that's provided the share price with a much-needed fillip. ""However, it's a bit premature to pop any champagne corks just yet."" He said one-off costs had led to a ""steep decline"" in reported profits, adding that ""the supermarket's debt pile also looks pretty high, though the good news is the pension scheme has moved into surplus"". Mr Khalaf added: ""Perhaps most concerning is that sales growth is flatlining at best. In some bits of the business, notably clothing and general merchandise, sales are in retreat. Of course, this all contrasts with a resurgent Tesco, which makes Sainsbury's sales performance look pallid by comparison.""

Beavers given protected status in Scotland,"This video can not be played Scottish beavers protected in law Wildlife organisations have welcomed new legislation making beavers a protected species in Scotland. It is now illegal to kill beavers or destroy established dams and lodges without a licence. The Scottish Wildlife Trust said legal protection for beavers was ""an important step"" to enable the species to ""expand its range."" Farming leadershave raised concernsabout the damage caused to agricultural land from beavers' dam-building. The animalswere reintroduced to Scotland's waterwaysa decade ago. There are currently about 450 beavers in Scotland, in Tayside and mid-Argyll. Scottish Wildlife Trust chief executive Jo Pike said beavers were ""unrivalled as ecosystem engineers."" She said: ""Granting beavers protected status is an important milestone for the return of the species to Scotland's lochs and rivers. ""It follows decades of work by countless organisations and individuals to demonstrate the positive impacts that beavers can have. Ms Pike said the trust accepted that land managers must have the ability to deal with ""localised negative impacts"" caused by beavers. She said: ""However, it is equally important to ensure lethal control is only used as a last resort, and this does not threaten the successful spread of beavers into other areas of Scotland."" Farmer Adrian Ivory said beaver dams cost his business thousands of pounds every year Adrian Ivory is farm manager at Strathisla Farms in Perthshire. Last year beavers set up home close to his wheat field. He told the BBC that the beavers damming on a nearby burn resulted in his crop being destroyed. He said: ""The big problem for us with the dams is that it costs me as a business Â£4,000-Â£5,000 a year, pulling dams out of watercourses, trying to sort banks out. ""These are problems that we shouldn't really be having to deal with. ""We are trying to produce quality food for the population to eat and this is just causing real problems and a cost to my business.""

"What to look out for in the local electionsMore than 8,000 councillor seats in England and 462 in Northern Ireland are up for grabs.UK Politics","On Thursday 2 May, voters will head to the polls across England for local elections. The elections will decide who runs local authorities across the country and could be an important test of public and political opinion for Theresa May, Jeremy Corbyn and the other party leaders. There are 343 councils in England. They provide a wide range of services, depending on their shape and size. These include housing, road maintenance, parking, rubbish collection, leisure and cultural facilities, school funding and admissions, environmental health, planning and social services. The largest local authorities are also responsible for adult social care and children's services. Councillors are elected to sit on these councils and represent people in a specific geographical area for a fixed term of four years. They decide on the overall direction of policy, which is implemented on a day-to-day basis by non-elected council officials. This video can not be played Local elections: What are they all about? Elections take place in four-year cycles, with different councils holding elections in different years. This time around, elections are taking place in 248 councils, with 8,425 seats up for grabs and about 25,000 people standing.   By-elections can take place in some council wards even if that council is not scheduled for elections this year. Check your council website for details. The vast majority of England's smaller district councils are holding elections. Nearly 120 of these are electing a full slate of councillors while a smaller number are choosing only a third. There are 30 of England's larger unitary authorities, such as Bedford, Stoke-on-Trent, Redcar and Cleveland and York, which are electing all their councillors while a smaller number are choosing a third. In addition, the majority of England's 36 metropolitan borough councils - including cities such as Manchester, Liverpool and Newcastle Upon Tyne - are electing a third of their representatives. There are no polls in Birmingham this year while the only elections in London are by-elections for two wards in Lewisham and Havering borough councils. Voters will not be heading to the polls in Cornwall while there are no elections in any of England's 26 ""shire"" county councils. However, many of England's 8,000 parish and community councils will elect representatives to make decisions on planning applications, amenities and other issues on behalf of their local villages and towns. According to the Electoral Reform Society, there are about 150 council wards where there is only one candidate who will be elected unopposed. Voters will also be going to the polls in Northern Ireland to elect 462 councillors across 11 council areas. There are no local elections this year in Wales or Scotland. 30 unitary authorities will be contested in their entirety - including Bedford, Brighton, Stoke, Redcar and York If you are registered to vote, you will be able to take part in Thursday's elections. If there is an election in your area, you should have already received a polling card, giving details of your nearest polling station. You should take this with you when you go to vote, although in most places you will be able to vote without it. Polling stations open at 07.00 BST and close at 22.00 BST. The deadline for registering has passed so if you are not on the electoral register, you will not be able to vote. To find out whether you are registered, contact your local Electoral Registration Office viathe gov.uk website.,external If you live in certain parts of the country, you will need to take ID with you when you vote - as part of an ongoing government trial to tackle voter fraud. InBroxtowe,external,Craven,external,Derby,external,North Kesteven,externalandBraintree,external, voters will have to show either one piece of photo ID or two forms of non-photo ID. InMid Sussex,external,Watford,externalandNorth West Leicestershire,external, people will have to bring their polling cards or photo ID. Voters inPendle,externalandWoking,externalwill only be able to show photo ID at the polling station to be given a ballot paper. Parties are said to run, or have control, of a council if they have more seats than all their opponents combined. If no party has a majority, a council is said to be under no overall control. Those parties with the most seats are referred to as being the largest party and can strike deals with others, such as independents, to run the local authority. According to the Local Government Information Unit,citing House of Commons library figures,external, 56% of councils are currently under Tory control, Labour run 28% while the Lib Dems control 3%. The remaining 12% are under no overall control. This video can not be played Council elections: Why don't two-thirds of people vote? In most cases, these seats were last contested in 2015, on the same day as that year's general election, in which the Conservatives won a majority in Parliament. A lot has changed since then, of course. The Conservatives are defending the largest number of seats, with 4,906 Tory councillors up for re-election, compared with 2,113 for Labour. The Liberal Democrats have 647 seats to defend, UKIP 176 and the Green Party 71. There are also 512 seats held by independents being fought. There will be a battle royal in Brighton where, after a series of Labour defections and by-elections, the Conservatives are now the largest party. The Green Party - which used to run the council between 2011 and 2015 - is also looking to boost its presence. In Cheshire West and Chester the council is on a knife-edge with both Labour and the Conservatives fighting to be the largest party. Milton Keynes, Bolton, Calderdale and Blackpool may also switch hands, or the ruling party could lose its majority and surrender overall control. The Conservatives did relatively well in 2015 and the pressure will be on Theresa May this time Many voters will be motivated by purely local issues. But Brexit remains the dominant political subject and the polls will be a big test for Theresa May, who is under growing pressure from her MPs and activists angered by delays to the UK's departure from the EU. Labour's performance, as ever, will be closely watched to see if it is making progress in those areas needed to win a general election. The Lib Dems and Green Party will be hoping to do well on the back of their anti-Brexit, anti-austerity messages. UKIP is fielding about 1,400 candidates but the newly launched Brexit Party is focusing its attention on the European elections while new centrist party Change UK did not register in time to put up candidates. The race to be the first area to declare its result is not quite as intense as on general election night. But expect the first results to come in between midnight and 01.00 am on Friday, with St Helens, Sunderland, Swindon and North Tyneside among those vying to be the quickest. The busiest time is set to be between 02.00 and 04.00 BST, when results will start flooding in from across England, including Oldham, Plymouth, Portsmouth, Stockport, Liverpool and Trafford. However, some local authorities won't begin counting their votes until 09.00 am on Friday. Manchester is expected to declare at 15.00 BST, Brighton and York at 17.00 BST and Cheshire West and Chester at 19.00 BST. Yes, there are six mayoral contests taking place, in Bedford, Copeland, Leicester, Mansfield, Middlesbrough and a Metro Mayor for North of Tyne.

LivePMQs: Theresa May faces MPs' questions2 minutes ago,"Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson sacked after probe into National Security Council leak In a statement, PM says she has lost confidence in his ability to serve in the cabinet Mr Williamson ""strenuously"" denies leaking the information The Daily Telegraph reported the NSC agreed to let Chinese firm Huawei help build UK's 5G network He will be replaced as defence secretary by International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt Penny Mordaunt will be replaced by current Prisons Minister Rory Stewart Earlier: Theresa May questioned about Brexit by the Commons Liaison Committee At Prime Minister's Questions, Jeremy Corbyn challenged PM on social mobility record Thanks for joining us for reaction to the sacking of Gavin Williamson as defence secretary - that's where we will leave our live updates for this evening. His departure follows an inquiry into a leak from a top-level National Security Council meeting, over a plan to allow Huawei limited access to help build the UK's new 5G network. He has been replaced by Penny Mordaunt, who will become the UK's first female defence secretary. Mr Williamson has ""strenuously"" denied leaking information from the meeting, but the PM said ""no other credible version of events"" has been found to explain the leak. Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson and Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable have both said they think the police should get involved in the matter. But Scotland Yard said in a statement that it was a matter for the National Security Council and the Cabinet Office, and it was not carrying out an investigation. BBC News Channel Gavin
Williamsonâs denial over being behind the leak from a top-level National
Security Council meeting is âextraordinaryâ, a security think tank says. Prof Michael Clarke, from the Royal United Services Institute, says
Mr Williamson has implied that the investigation was ânot formal or thoroughâ
which is a direct criticism of those who conducted the inquiry. He adds: âGavin Williamson is going down fighting
and heâs maintaining, in effect, that theyâve got the wrong man. âThatâs extraordinary â for a senior minister to be in that
position.â BBC News Channel Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable says Gavin Williamson's sacking is ""absolutely extraordinary"". He says he agrees with Labour deputy leader Tom Watson that ""this is clearly a police matter"". ""The Metropolitan Police are going to have to get involved as quickly as possible"".

He added: ""I have a lot of confidence in the process he will have conducted. I have a lot of confidence in the prime minister and I'm sure that they made the right decision.""

Laura KuenssbergBBC political editor Downing Street has made a very serious accusation and is sure enough to carry out this sacking. For the prime minister's allies, it will show that she is, despite the political turmoil, still strong enough to move some of her ministers around - to hire and fire. Mr Williamson is strenuously still denying that the leak was anything to do with him at all. There is nothing fond, or anything conciliatory, in either the letter from the prime minister to him, or his reply back to her. Read more here. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt says the prime minister had no alternative but to sack Gavin Williamson as defence secretary. Speaking as he arrived in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, Mr Hunt said: ""On a personal level I'm very sorry about what happened for Gavin's sake but given the gravity of the situation there was no other alternative outcome."" Labourâs deputy leader Tom Watson has called for a police inquiry to investigate whether or not Gavin Williamson breached the Official Secrets Act. âItâs the most brutal sacking letter of any minister Iâve seen in my lifetimeâ he said. âThe magnitude of the allegation against him is very serious.â He said that it was a crime to breach the Official Secrets Act, but acknowledged that Mr Williamson strenuously denies the allegation. âHe denies it â he deserves to have his voice heard.â The way to do that is to hold a âcriminal inquiryâ he added, which he said he believed should âgo ahead rapidly.â The new international development secretary tweets...

Scotland Yard says it is not carrying out an investigation into the leak from a top-level National Security Council meeting. In a statement, it said: ""We're aware of the media reports in relation to the leak and that is a matter for the National Security Council and the Cabinet Office to look at. ""At this time, we're not carrying out an investigation. ""Clearly if at any stage we receive any information that would suggest criminal offences have been committed, then we will look into that."" Penny Mordaunt's appointment as the new defence secretary follows a term serving as the International Development Secretary. Ms Mordant has a background as a naval reservist and previously served as the armed forces minister under David Cameron. The daughter of a paratrooper and a special needs teacher, she is probably best known outside Westminster for her appearance on ITV's celebrity diving show Splash! to raise money for charity. She campaigned for a Leave vote in the 2016 EU referendum. Downing Street has played down talk of a possible prosecution over the leak from a top-level National Security Council meeting. Theresa May's official spokesman told a Westminster briefing: ""It is not for the government to determine prosecutions, but the prime minister has said, from her point of view, that she considers the matter to be closed."" Mrs May met Mr Williamson in her Commons office for half an hour after receiving a briefing on the leak inquiry in the early afternoon. Labour MP tweets...  Allow Twitter content?

LiveLivePMQs: Theresa May faces MPs' questionsTheresa May is answering questions from Jeremy Corbyn and backbench MPs before she is quizzed by a committee on Brexit.Parliaments,"Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson sacked after probe into National Security Council leak In a statement, PM says she has lost confidence in his ability to serve in the cabinet Mr Williamson ""strenuously"" denies leaking the information The Daily Telegraph reported the NSC agreed to let Chinese firm Huawei help build UK's 5G network He will be replaced as defence secretary by International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt Penny Mordaunt will be replaced by current Prisons Minister Rory Stewart Earlier: Theresa May questioned about Brexit by the Commons Liaison Committee At Prime Minister's Questions, Jeremy Corbyn challenged PM on social mobility record Thanks for joining us for reaction to the sacking of Gavin Williamson as defence secretary - that's where we will leave our live updates for this evening. His departure follows an inquiry into a leak from a top-level National Security Council meeting, over a plan to allow Huawei limited access to help build the UK's new 5G network. He has been replaced by Penny Mordaunt, who will become the UK's first female defence secretary. Mr Williamson has ""strenuously"" denied leaking information from the meeting, but the PM said ""no other credible version of events"" has been found to explain the leak. Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson and Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable have both said they think the police should get involved in the matter. But Scotland Yard said in a statement that it was a matter for the National Security Council and the Cabinet Office, and it was not carrying out an investigation. BBC News Channel Gavin
Williamsonâs denial over being behind the leak from a top-level National
Security Council meeting is âextraordinaryâ, a security think tank says. Prof Michael Clarke, from the Royal United Services Institute, says
Mr Williamson has implied that the investigation was ânot formal or thoroughâ
which is a direct criticism of those who conducted the inquiry. He adds: âGavin Williamson is going down fighting
and heâs maintaining, in effect, that theyâve got the wrong man. âThatâs extraordinary â for a senior minister to be in that
position.â BBC News Channel Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable says Gavin Williamson's sacking is ""absolutely extraordinary"". He says he agrees with Labour deputy leader Tom Watson that ""this is clearly a police matter"". ""The Metropolitan Police are going to have to get involved as quickly as possible"".

Laura KuenssbergBBC political editor Downing Street has made a very serious accusation and is sure enough to carry out this sacking. For the prime minister's allies, it will show that she is, despite the political turmoil, still strong enough to move some of her ministers around - to hire and fire. Mr Williamson is strenuously still denying that the leak was anything to do with him at all. There is nothing fond, or anything conciliatory, in either the letter from the prime minister to him, or his reply back to her. Read more here. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt says the prime minister had no alternative but to sack Gavin Williamson as defence secretary. Speaking as he arrived in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, Mr Hunt said: ""On a personal level I'm very sorry about what happened for Gavin's sake but given the gravity of the situation there was no other alternative outcome."" Labourâs deputy leader Tom Watson has called for a police inquiry to investigate whether or not Gavin Williamson breached the Official Secrets Act. âItâs the most brutal sacking letter of any minister Iâve seen in my lifetimeâ he said. âThe magnitude of the allegation against him is very serious.â He said that it was a crime to breach the Official Secrets Act, but acknowledged that Mr Williamson strenuously denies the allegation. âHe denies it â he deserves to have his voice heard.â The way to do that is to hold a âcriminal inquiryâ he added, which he said he believed should âgo ahead rapidly.â The new international development secretary tweets...

Scotland Yard says it is not carrying out an investigation into the leak from a top-level National Security Council meeting. In a statement, it said: ""We're aware of the media reports in relation to the leak and that is a matter for the National Security Council and the Cabinet Office to look at. ""At this time, we're not carrying out an investigation. ""Clearly if at any stage we receive any information that would suggest criminal offences have been committed, then we will look into that."" Penny Mordaunt's appointment as the new defence secretary follows a term serving as the International Development Secretary. Ms Mordant has a background as a naval reservist and previously served as the armed forces minister under David Cameron. The daughter of a paratrooper and a special needs teacher, she is probably best known outside Westminster for her appearance on ITV's celebrity diving show Splash! to raise money for charity. She campaigned for a Leave vote in the 2016 EU referendum. Downing Street has played down talk of a possible prosecution over the leak from a top-level National Security Council meeting. Theresa May's official spokesman told a Westminster briefing: ""It is not for the government to determine prosecutions, but the prime minister has said, from her point of view, that she considers the matter to be closed."" Mrs May met Mr Williamson in her Commons office for half an hour after receiving a briefing on the leak inquiry in the early afternoon. Labour MP tweets...  Allow Twitter content?

from the point of view of defence. âHe has been good for defence"", the Conservative MP adds. However he says that âit probably is inevitable that

GuaidÃÂ³ calls for more Venezuela protests,"This video can not be played Opposition leader Juan GuaidÃ³ is appealing to the military for support Juan GuaidÃ³ has appealed for his supporters to take to the streets of Venezuela again on Wednesday, after a day of violent clashes on Tuesday. President NicolÃ¡s Maduro, whom the opposition leader is trying to unseat, remains defiant despite the protests. In a television address he described Mr GuaidÃ³'s supporters as a ""small group"" whose plan had failed. Meanwhile, the US administration alleges Mr Maduro had been ready to travel to Cuba to escape the unrest. ""They had an airplane on the tarmac. He was ready to leave this morning [Tuesday], as we understand it. Russians indicated he should stay,"" US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told CNN, without offering evidence. Senior US officials also claimed three prominent figures in Mr Maduro's government had agreed the president had to go, but later backtracked. US National Security Advisor John Bolton said those figures allegedly included Defence Secretary Vladimir Padrino - who has since reaffirmed his support and appeared alongside Mr Maduro in his televised address. Who is Juan GuaidÃ³? Profile: NicolÃ¡s Maduro Venezuela crisis: The bridge of desperation Sitting alongside military commanders, Mr Maduro vowed he would be victorious in the face of what he called a coup attempt backed by US imperialism. He also said events of Tuesday would ""not go unpunished"". ""[Prosecutors] will launch criminal prosecutions for the serious crimes that have been committed against the constitution, the rule of law and the right to peace,"" he said in his speech. This video can not be played Venezuela's President NicolÃ¡s Maduro defiant in speech Meanwhile, Mr GuaidÃ³ has renewed his calls for Venezuelans to take to the streets to complete what he has said is the ""final phase"" of his effort to oust Mr Maduro. A three-minute video by Mr GuaidÃ³ was published in the early hours of Tuesday. It showed him standing alongside a number of men in military uniform, as he announced he had the support of ""brave soldiers"" in Caracas. ""The National Armed Forces have taken the correct decision... they are guaranteed to be on the right side of history,"" he said. He urged Venezuelans to join them in the streets, and also appeared alongside another opposition leader, Leopoldo LÃ³pez, who had been under house arrest since 2014. Supporters on both sides then gathered in different places in the capital, Caracas, throughout Tuesday. Despite Mr GuaidÃ³'s calls, it appeared most of the military stayed on the side of Mr Maduro during the clashes. This video can not be played ""This is unstoppable,"" says Carlos Vecchio, Juan Guaido's envoy to the US There were running clashes between Mr GuaidÃ³'s supporters and armed military vehicles throughout the day. Protesters were also seen throwing rocks, but being repelled by tear gas and water cannon. At one stage a military vehicle was captured on video appearing to drive into protesters. Mr GuaidÃ³, the president of the opposition-controlled National Assembly, has been calling on Venezuela's military to back him ever since he declared himself interim president in January. He argues that President Maduro is a ""usurper"" because he was re-elected in polls that had been widely disputed. Is there a new cult of personality in Venezuela? Venezuela blackout: 'Like living in the apocalypse' Venezuela crisis in nine charts Tuesday marked the most violent episode of the Venezuelan political crisis this year. Venezuelan heath officials said 69 people were injured in the clashes, including two with bullet wounds. Broadcasts from a number of news agencies, including the BBC and CNN, were apparently suspended amid the violence. Later on Tuesday, it emerged Mr LÃ³pez had sought safety in the Chilean, then the Spanish embassy, along with his family. Chilean Foreign Minister Roberto Ampuero said it was Mr LÃ³pez's ""personal decision"", because he and his wife Lilian Tintori are of Spanish descent. Tuesday's events were definitely dramatic. But it's not clear where they leave Venezuela. Juan GuaidÃ³ made a bold move by saying the armed forces were on his side early in the morning. And the fact that opposition politician Leopoldo LÃ³pez, who was under house arrest, stood beside him was also a big surprise. Who had freed him and what did that say about the loyalties of the armed forces? But as the day went on, doubts began to surface - who exactly was backing the so-called uprising? We still don't have the answers. Mr GuaidÃ³'s video on Tuesday night, calling for people to come out onto the streets again on Wednesday, was a motivational pep talk that felt hollow. He claims Mr Maduro has neither the support nor the respect of the armed forces, yet clearly the generals at the top - whose support Mr GuaidÃ³ needs - aren't on the opposition's side either. This is seen by many as another failed attempt by the opposition to take power. Yet, although Mr Maduro still occupies the presidential palace, his future isn't secure either -  he summed up the day as ""intense"" in a lengthy address on state television but there's no question both sides will be feeling the heat after Tuesday. The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has now issued an emergency prohibition against all US carriers flying below 26,000ft in Venezuelan airspace. It also said all US operators should leave the country within 48 hours, due to increasing political instability. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has appealed for both sides to avoid violence. The United States, who has backed Mr GuaidÃ³ since he declared himself interim leader, reiterated their support on Tuesday. President Donald Trump said he was monitoring events in Venezuela ""very closely"" and said the US stood with the Venezuelan people and their freedom. He also threatened to implement the ""highest-level sanctions"" and a ""full and complete embargo"" against the island of Cuba, unless their military immediately ceased its support of Mr Maduro. ""Hopefully, all Cuban soldiers will promptly and peacefully return to their island!"" he tweeted. John Bolton has called on Venezuelan officials to ""do what is right"" for he country Other governments who still support Mr Maduro, including Bolivia and Cuba, condemned Mr GuaidÃ³'s efforts as an attempted ""coup d'etat"". The Mexican government expressed ""concern about a possible increase in violence"" in Venezuela, while Colombian President Ivan Duque urged the Venezuelan military to stand ""on the right side of history"" against Maduro.

Turner Prize 2019 shortlist is announced,"Clockwise from top left: Lawrence Abu Hamdan, Helen Cammock, Oscar Murillo and Tai Shani The four artists competing for this year's Turner Prize have been announced with investigative art, works blurring fact and fiction and explorations of oppression dominating the shortlist. The nominees are Lawrence Abu Hamdan, who is British but based in Beirut, London-based Helen Cammock and Tai Shani and Colombian Oscar Murillo. Their works will go on show at the Turner Contemporary in Margate from 28 September until January 2020. The winner is announced on 3 December. Arts editor Will Gompertz has been looking at the artists and their work. Beirut-based Lawrence Abu Hamdan is an artist more interested in the ear than the eye. He thinks of himself as an ""audio investigator"" who makes films, installations, and gives performative lectures based on earwitness (not eyewitness) accounts from oppressed individuals, or, in another project, from racially-profiled individuals who are being judged on the basis of how they pronounce certain words or syllables. Helen Cammock is also interested in sound and history. She too makes films and gives spoken word performances. But her area of investigation is past events and their histories; not a single, definitive written account but a variety of views and texts, which can be perceived differently when spoken by other people. Fellow London-based artist Tai Shani shares Cammock's interest in the written word and associated assumptions, depending on the gender and perceived status of the author. She also organises performances, makes films, and creates installations. The difference with Shani is she's not that interested in multiple viewpoints of history, more in creating alternative, almost gothic worlds that blur fact and fiction, or truth and myth, with the intention of disrupting a real world dominated by, and centred around, a white, western, male point of view. Oscar Murillo is a Colombian-British artist and the most established name on the shortlist. He became an instant art world hit when he first emerged on the scene six years ago. His work made huge sums for a relatively unknown 20-something artist. Things cooled for a bit - but now he's back, with his semi-abstract paintings on unstretched canvasses hanging limply like curtains in a bedsit with too few hooks. They are, in a way, more like objects in an installation than pictures to put on a wall. He, like his fellow nominees, is exploring the politics of identity, oppression, and marginalised people. The winner will be announced on 3 December 2019 at an award ceremony broadcast live on the BBC. Follow us onFacebook,external, on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external, or on Instagram atbbcnewsents,external.

The United States, who has backed Mr GuaidÃ³ since he declared himself interim leader, reiterated their support on Tuesday. President Donald Trump said he was monitoring events in Venezuela ""very closely"" and said the US stood with the Venezuelan people and their freedom. He also threatened to implement the ""highest-level sanctions"" and a ""full and complete embargo"" against the island of Cuba, unless their military immediately ceased its support of Mr Maduro. ""Hopefully, all Cuban soldiers will promptly and peacefully return to their island!"" he tweeted. John Bolton has called on Venezuelan officials to ""do what is right"" for he country Other governments who still support Mr Maduro, including Bolivia and Cuba, condemned Mr GuaidÃ³'s efforts as an attempted ""coup d'etat"". The Mexican government expressed ""concern about a possible increase in violence"" in Venezuela, while Colombian President Ivan Duque urged the Venezuelan military to stand ""on the right side of history"" against Maduro.

'I was raped' by police officer ex-husband,"This video can not be played 'Suzanne' says she believes her ex-husband was ""protected because of his job"" Police officers and staff accused of domestic abuse are a third less likely to be convicted than the general public, figures from 37 forces suggest. They show 3.9% of claims against police led to a conviction from 2015-18 in England and Wales, compared with 6.2% among the population as a whole. Police domestic abuse lead Dame Vera Baird said the issue does not ""appear to be taken as seriously"" as it should. The Home Office said it was bringing in reforms ""to improve police integrity"". Figures from the Freedom of Information request,conducted by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism (TBIJ),,externalalso found that more than four allegations of domestic abuse against police staff were recorded each week. Fewer than a quarter of those allegations led to disciplinary action. There are 200,000 members of the police workforce in England and Walesaccording to latest figures,external, of whom 122,000 are police officers. Suzanne - not her real name - told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme her ex-husband, a police officer, was violent towards her for years. She said she eventually called police when he threatened her with a knife, but they did very little. ""The police turned up and the only advice they gave him was he should leave the house and go for a walk to calm down. ""I don't remember them talking to me at all,"" she added. Suzanne said the violence escalated and her ex-husband hit their six-year-old son. When she filed for divorce, she said he raped her. She moved out with her children and reported him to his boss. Suzanne believes her ex-husband was ""protected because of his job"" A domestic abuse officer came to investigate, but Suzanne says they did not take a statement and no record was made on file. A few months later, her son was seen by a teacher being pushed into a car by his father. In a police interview - which Suzanne says she only saw four years later - her son said his father ""tried to strangle him and had his hands on his throat"", she said. No charges were brought against her ex-husband. She believes he was ""protected because of his job"". After years of suffering post-traumatic stress, she decided to go back to the police and obtain access to her police file, but she found nothing on record. The force said it would investigate her complaint but because there was nothing on file it closed the case. The police watchdog, the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), asked the force to reinvestigate Suzanne's case last year. And now 16 months later, the force has said it cannot uphold her complaint. Her husband has since retired but Suzanne now plans to sue the force - which cannot be named for legal reasons. The national domestic abuse charity SafeLives said the figures showed just ""the tip of the iceberg"". Chief executive Suzanne Jacob said it ""would urge every police force to pay close attention to what these stories and statistics show us -  that women are being silenced and abused by people in positions of trust and power."" Dame Vera Baird QC said she was ""not surprised that these issues don't appear to be taken as seriously as they should be by the police"". Dame Vera Baird said some officers were ""quite resistant to hearing about wrongdoing in colleagues"" There was a ""defensive, mutually supportive culture"" among police officers, she said, which can make ""forces and probably some individual officers quite resistant to hearing about wrongdoing in colleagues."" In Northumbria, where she serves as police and crime commissioner, she said she would look into creating a system where any criminal investigations against police staff would be handed over to a neighbouring force to carry out. The Home Office said it was ""essential that every allegation of domestic abuse is taken seriously. ""Where allegations are made against those working for the police, their status and powers mean it is even more important that these are thoroughly investigated to maintain public confidence."" It added: ""Where officers commit a serious breach of the standards expected of them, disciplinary and, if required, criminal proceedings should follow. ""We are also implementing a wide-ranging programme of reforms to improve police integrity, including improving the transparency of the disciplinary system and strengthening the powers of the IOPC.""

Defibrillator hope after runner's death,"This video can not be played Ben McDonald's death was ""out of the blue"" ""He was really fit, really healthy, there was no indication that was going to happen."" Ben McDonald, 25, died after going into cardiac arrest at the finish line of the Cardiff Half Marathon in October 2018. A defibrillator was used and although it did not save him, his family want more of them in public places. A coroner's report concluded he died fromsudden arrhythmic death syndrome,external(SADs). ""He was very special,"" said Ben's mother Ruth McDonald, from the Vale of Glamorgan. ""He was just gorgeous, funny, happy, always smiling, he just wanted every moment to be special. ""One of his favourite mottos is 'happiness is only real when shared' and he just loved being with people."" Ben McDonald loved snowboarding and spent two seasons in the Alps Ben's brother Andrew said he loved being active. ""He was just extremely sporty, extremely active, he loved being outdoors, he loved playing, everything you can hurt yourself doing,"" Andrew said. The youngest of four children, Ben had worked at the Cardiff White Water Centre since the age of 16 and was also a qualified teacher. Ruth McDonald said her son was ""always smiling"" The 25-year-old was part of a group of seven who took part in the annually-held half marathon race, along with his girlfriend, his brother Steve and his wife, Andrew and his wife and his sister's husband. They had been ""planning it for months"" and were ""getting quite competitive"". ""It all started so happy, it was a beautiful sunny day, he ran the race, he exceeded the time he set for himself, he beat one of his brothers and then he collapsed as he crossed the finish line,"" Ruth said. ""He died more or less straight away."" Ruth said medics used CPR and a defibrillator, but he could not be saved. ""He was really fit, really healthy, there was no indication that was going to happen,"" she said. ""I think what we've learnt is life is unpredictable, we don't know what lies around the corner. Ben McDonald (third in from the left) ran the Cardiff Half Marathon with family members ""Screening might have saved Ben, it might not have done. A defibrillator could have saved Ben, but it didn't. ""But we really endorse the fact that we need defibrillators everywhere, so that people can get instant or as instant help as possible and screening might show things up. ""So it's important young people getting involved in sports activities have their hearts checked over."" She added: ""We didn't think this would happen to us... Ben was going to be fine and we'd see him get married and have children and get old and that didn't happen. ""Enjoy every moment with your children because you never know which moment is the last moment and family life is precious, tell those you love, you love them."" Half marathon pair died of 'natural causes' Race death family retrace final steps Donors raise Â£13k after race deaths A second man, Dean Fletcher, 32, from Exeter,also died at the event after crossing the finishing linewithin minutes of Ben on 7 October. In the wake of Ben's death, his charity page, in aid of Maternity Africa in north Tanzania, received hundreds of donations, raising almost Â£21,000 for the charity. The family have since all had heart screening and want to help raise awareness of the importance of defibrillators in public places. Andrew said: ""It's so stereotypical to be like 'he was a great guy, he was lovely, everyone loved him', but he was. He was above and beyond that."" He added: ""It was just so out of the blue, it could happen to anybody, our motto was live for that moment. The family all have a tattoo, similar to one Ben also had, showing the things he loved ""You can't live your life scared, but there are things you can do, wear a helmet if you're out snowboarding, if you can get your heart checked out, get it checked out. ""If it saves one person's life [heart screening] that's good, because it's not just the person who dies that suffers, everybody suffers and that's the hardest part."" Vicki Edwards, Ben's sister said they are trying to do ""things that he loved"". Among the plans is a festival style event, BenJam, which will be held on Thursday evening as a ""way to remember his birthday"". Money raised from ticket sales will go to the Welsh Hearts charity. Vicki said over 200 people have bought tickets and they hope to make it an annual event. The Welsh Governmentsaid it has provided funding totalling,externalÂ£586,000 for a project called Save a Life Cymru, which aims to improve access to CPR training and increase the awareness and use of defibrillators.

GuaidÃÂ³ calls for more Venezuela protestsJuan GuaidÃÂ³ calls for opposition supporters to take to the streets again after a day of clashes.Latin America & Caribbean,"This video can not be played Opposition leader Juan GuaidÃ³ is appealing to the military for support Juan GuaidÃ³ has appealed for his supporters to take to the streets of Venezuela again on Wednesday, after a day of violent clashes on Tuesday. President NicolÃ¡s Maduro, whom the opposition leader is trying to unseat, remains defiant despite the protests. In a television address he described Mr GuaidÃ³'s supporters as a ""small group"" whose plan had failed. Meanwhile, the US administration alleges Mr Maduro had been ready to travel to Cuba to escape the unrest. ""They had an airplane on the tarmac. He was ready to leave this morning [Tuesday], as we understand it. Russians indicated he should stay,"" US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told CNN, without offering evidence. Senior US officials also claimed three prominent figures in Mr Maduro's government had agreed the president had to go, but later backtracked. US National Security Advisor John Bolton said those figures allegedly included Defence Secretary Vladimir Padrino - who has since reaffirmed his support and appeared alongside Mr Maduro in his televised address. Who is Juan GuaidÃ³? Profile: NicolÃ¡s Maduro Venezuela crisis: The bridge of desperation Sitting alongside military commanders, Mr Maduro vowed he would be victorious in the face of what he called a coup attempt backed by US imperialism. He also said events of Tuesday would ""not go unpunished"". ""[Prosecutors] will launch criminal prosecutions for the serious crimes that have been committed against the constitution, the rule of law and the right to peace,"" he said in his speech. This video can not be played Venezuela's President NicolÃ¡s Maduro defiant in speech Meanwhile, Mr GuaidÃ³ has renewed his calls for Venezuelans to take to the streets to complete what he has said is the ""final phase"" of his effort to oust Mr Maduro. A three-minute video by Mr GuaidÃ³ was published in the early hours of Tuesday. It showed him standing alongside a number of men in military uniform, as he announced he had the support of ""brave soldiers"" in Caracas. ""The National Armed Forces have taken the correct decision... they are guaranteed to be on the right side of history,"" he said. He urged Venezuelans to join them in the streets, and also appeared alongside another opposition leader, Leopoldo LÃ³pez, who had been under house arrest since 2014. Supporters on both sides then gathered in different places in the capital, Caracas, throughout Tuesday. Despite Mr GuaidÃ³'s calls, it appeared most of the military stayed on the side of Mr Maduro during the clashes. This video can not be played ""This is unstoppable,"" says Carlos Vecchio, Juan Guaido's envoy to the US There were running clashes between Mr GuaidÃ³'s supporters and armed military vehicles throughout the day. Protesters were also seen throwing rocks, but being repelled by tear gas and water cannon. At one stage a military vehicle was captured on video appearing to drive into protesters. Mr GuaidÃ³, the president of the opposition-controlled National Assembly, has been calling on Venezuela's military to back him ever since he declared himself interim president in January. He argues that President Maduro is a ""usurper"" because he was re-elected in polls that had been widely disputed. Is there a new cult of personality in Venezuela? Venezuela blackout: 'Like living in the apocalypse' Venezuela crisis in nine charts Tuesday marked the most violent episode of the Venezuelan political crisis this year. Venezuelan heath officials said 69 people were injured in the clashes, including two with bullet wounds. Broadcasts from a number of news agencies, including the BBC and CNN, were apparently suspended amid the violence. Later on Tuesday, it emerged Mr LÃ³pez had sought safety in the Chilean, then the Spanish embassy, along with his family. Chilean Foreign Minister Roberto Ampuero said it was Mr LÃ³pez's ""personal decision"", because he and his wife Lilian Tintori are of Spanish descent. Tuesday's events were definitely dramatic. But it's not clear where they leave Venezuela. Juan GuaidÃ³ made a bold move by saying the armed forces were on his side early in the morning. And the fact that opposition politician Leopoldo LÃ³pez, who was under house arrest, stood beside him was also a big surprise. Who had freed him and what did that say about the loyalties of the armed forces? But as the day went on, doubts began to surface - who exactly was backing the so-called uprising? We still don't have the answers. Mr GuaidÃ³'s video on Tuesday night, calling for people to come out onto the streets again on Wednesday, was a motivational pep talk that felt hollow. He claims Mr Maduro has neither the support nor the respect of the armed forces, yet clearly the generals at the top - whose support Mr GuaidÃ³ needs - aren't on the opposition's side either. This is seen by many as another failed attempt by the opposition to take power. Yet, although Mr Maduro still occupies the presidential palace, his future isn't secure either -  he summed up the day as ""intense"" in a lengthy address on state television but there's no question both sides will be feeling the heat after Tuesday. The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has now issued an emergency prohibition against all US carriers flying below 26,000ft in Venezuelan airspace.

Pay by cash? Not for long,"The system allowing people to use cash in the UK is at risk of ""falling apart"" and needs a new guarantee to ensure notes and coins can still be used. A hard-hitting review by finance experts has concluded that market forces will not save cash for as long as people need it. The report calls on the government and regulators to step in to ensure cash remains viable. Suggestions include ensuring rural shops offer cash-back. The report also said that essential services, such as utility and council bills, should still allow customers to pay in cash. The bar where your cash is worthless Debit card payments more popular than cash New Â£50 bank note 'must recognise ethnic minorities' An independent body, funded by the banks, should be set up that would step in if local communities were running short of access to cash in shops and ATMs, the report said. The research - called the Access to Cash Review - is authored by former financial ombudsman Natalie Ceeney and was paid for by cash machine network operator Link, but was independent from it. It took evidence from nearly 100 businesses and charities across the UK. Cash use has been falling dramatically in recent years. In 2017, debit card use - driven by contactless payments - overtook the number of payments made in cash in the UK for the first time. The report said that the current rate of decline would mean cash use would end in 2026. However, it concluded that notes and coins would still be used in 15 years' time, but accounting for between 10% and 15% of transactions. The demise of cash, if unchecked, would be driven primarily by retailers and other businesses refusing to accept cash owing to the cost of handling it. Mike Keen opened The Boot pub in Freston, near Ipswich, last year as a cashless business with no tills. ""There are a whole bunch of reasons. The [biggest] gain is management time,"" he said, such as never having to cash up at the end of the day, drive to the bank and queue to pay it in, two or three times a week. He said that saved the business 15 hours a week, and many thousands of pounds. Insurance premiums had been lower as there was no cash on the premises, security was less of a problem, and the time taken to serve customers was much quicker, he said. Banknotes and coins are a necessity for eight million people, according to the review's interim findingspublished in December. These include rural communities where alternative ways of paying are affected by poor broadband or mobile connectivity, and many people who have physical or mental health problems and therefore find it hard to use digital services. The report also concludes that vulnerability in this area is generally the result of income, not old age. ""Poverty is the biggest indicator of cash dependency, not age,"" the review concludes. ""There are worrying signs that our cash system is falling apart. ATM and bank branch closures are just the tip of the iceberg, underneath there is a huge infrastructure which is becoming increasingly unviable as cash use declines,"" Ms Ceeney said. ""If we sleepwalk into a cashless society, millions will be left behind."" Kev Jackson has been homeless and currently lives in temporary accommodation. ""Cash is easy because you know what you have got on you,"" he said. ""On a card - when you can't see your balance - it is easy to overspend. [Cash] is very good for budgeting."" ""A lot of people [on the streets] do not have bank accounts, so they only carry cash. If you can't spend cash in a shop, it is going to be difficult for them. They won't be able to survive."" He said that he preferred using a card himself, but was concerned that technology left many people behind. Evidence from Sweden, seen as much closer to a cashless society than the UK, suggested that infrastructure was needed before cash use declined beyond anyone's control. The review suggested that an independent body was needed to oversee a guarantee that people need not travel too far to get access to cash. Innovation should also be used to protect cash, such as: Local shops offering cash-back to customers, rather than customers relying on ATMs Small businesses given the opportunity to deposit cash in secure lockers or ""smart"" ATMs, rather than have to make a weekly trip to a bank branch A ""radical"" change to the infrastructure behind cash, overseen by the Bank of England, to lower the cost and maintain free access for consumers Britain's cash infrastructure costs around Â£5bn a year to run. It is paid for predominantly by the retail banks and run mostly by commercial operators. The Bank of England's chief cashier, Sarah John, said it would call together key players in this sector to develop a system that would support lower levels of cash use and encourage innovation ""to support cash as a viable means of payment for those who want to use it"". Consumer group Which? has called for a single regulator to have a statutory duty to protect access to cash and build a sustainable cash infrastructure for the UK. Eric Leenders, from UK Finance, which represents banks, said: ""The finance industry is using a range of solutions to ensure cash can still be accessed including over the counter withdrawals through 11,500 Post Offices and cash-back from retailers, to investment in ATMs and mobile bank branches to reach more rural communities. ""We will continue to work with the review team, government, and regulators to take forward this important work."" Ron Delnevo, of the ATM Industry Association, said that there should be a requirement, backed by law, on businesses to accept cash, mirroring moves by some local authorities in the US.

Machines close at record rate,"More than 250 free-to-use cash machines are disappearing a month as operators shut unprofitable ones, the network co-ordinator Link has said. There are 53,000 free machines in the UK - but the number is shrinking at a record rate as people use less cash. Now the Payment Systems Regulator (PSR) is cracking down on the closures and asking for more network protection. ""Free-to-use ATMs continue to play a vital role in helping people access their money,"" the regulator said. Hannah Nixon, the PSR's managing director, said: ""The requirements we intend to place on Link will help ensure that Link achieves their commitment to protecting the geographic spread of free-to-use ATMs across the UK."" Link's ATM Footprint Report found that between the end of January and the start of July 2018, the number of free-to-use ATMs fell from 54,500 to 53,200. That is partly because people are using cash less, Link said, thanks to the rise in popularity of new payment methods such as contactless transactions. But it is also because cash machine operators such as Cardtronics and Note Machine, who get a fee from our banks each time we use one, are finding that fewer of their machines are economic to run. Row intensifies over cash machines fee Who do we trust after cash? The High Streets with 'too many' ATMs Under pressure from banks, Link is cutting the fee it pays to operators while trying to restrict the resulting closures in city centres, Link said it had set up ""specific arrangements to protect free-to-use ATMs more than 1km away from their next nearest free-to-use ATM"". The organisation has earmarked some 2,365 free machines in remote and rural areas that it wants to remain open. But 76 of these protected cash machines closed between January and July, 21 of them without even a Post Office nearby to get cash over the counter. The PSR says it is concerned and is taking action to ensure Link meets its commitments. It is also seeking renewed commitments from banks that consumers will continue to be offered services, allowing them to access their cash. But the regulator's intervention on ATM closures may be ""too little, too late"", warned Nicky Morgan, Chair of the Treasury Committee. She said: ""The PSR is rightly concerned by the closures, but I fear its regulatory intervention may be too little, too late. It must ensure that Link is held to its commitment to maintain the broad geographic spread of free-to-use ATMs. ""The Committee has been clear that this is a major test of what is a relatively new regulator, but the banks, the ATM deployers, and Link itself also have a duty to ensure consumers don't lose out."" Jenni Allen, managing director of Which? Money, said: ""Link is failing on its commitment to protect access to cash for people in remote and rural areas who need it most. ""The PSR must now urgently intervene to stop further closures and ensure that no more consumers are suddenly stripped of their access to cash."" Radio 1 Newsbeat reporter Gurvinder Gill There are plenty of cash machines in King's Lynn town centre, you'll find most major banks here on the High Street. But some of the surrounding villages have been listed as the worst places in the country when it comes to accessing cash. Lauren, who lives in Narborough in Norfolk, told me she has to travel 10 minutes in her car to get to her closest ATM. She says she always has to be organised and often gets cash back at supermarkets. Lily lives in King's Lynn and told me her closest cash machine is at a Tesco Express which is 15 minutes away. She says she avoids using cash when she can, but does need it for nights out and getting a taxi home.

"Japan's new Emperor Naruhito pledges unityIn his first address as emperor, Naruhito also paid tribute to his father who abdicated on Tuesday.Asia","Emperor Naruhito stood alongside his wife, Empress Masako, as he spoke at the Imperial Palace Japan's Emperor Naruhito has pledged to fulfil his role as a ""symbol of the state and unity"", in his first public address since taking the throne. The 59-year-old was speaking as he officially began his reign on Wednesday in a short but symbolic ceremony at the Imperial Palace. Naruhito succeeds his father, 85-year-old Akihito, who abdicated citing his age and failing health. He is the first Japanese emperor to stand down in more than 200 years. Your questions answered on Japan's emperors Naruhito: Taking Japan into a new era Masako: The princess who struggles with royal life Akihito, who will now be known as Emperor Emeritus, had endeared himself to many Japanese people during his reign through his interactions with those suffering from disease and disaster. In his speech, Emperor Naruhito paid tribute to his father while pledging to show the same devotion to his people. ""[Akihito] showed profound compassion through his own bearing,"" he said. ""I swear that I will reflect deeply on the course followed by the Emperor Emeritus ... and fulfil my responsibility as the symbol of the state and of the unity of the people of Japan."" Naruhito technically became emperor at the stroke of midnight when his father's reign came to an end - marking the start of the new Reiwa era. But on Wednesday morning his place was formalised as he symbolically took possession of the sacred imperial regalia - a sword and a gem - that have been passed down through the generations. Emperor Naruhito has inherited the imperial regalia Japanese emperors do not wear a crown so these treasures, along with a mirror, act as a symbol of imperial power.

This video can not be played The moment Japan's new emperor inherits the Imperial Treasures Emperor Naruhito and his wife Masako Owada, a former diplomat, are expected to be more modern in their outlook. The Oxford-educated royal said in a news conference in 2017 that he believed ""that just as new winds blow in every age, the role of the imperial family changes in each age"". ""I would like to learn various things from the past while also pursuing the ideal role that the Imperial Family should take in the future,"" he said.,external However, he is expected to carry on his father's legacy - working to replicate the sense of closeness to the public that Emperor Akihito had built up. Naruhito and Masako in their Japanese Imperial wedding costumes in 1993 The Emperor and Empress reportedly met at a tea party and married in 1993. Empress Masako was educated at Harvard and Oxford, and had a promising career as a diplomat before her marriage. Masako later told reporters that she had accepted Naruhito's proposal after he said: ""You might have fears and worries about joining the imperial household. But I will protect you for my entire life."" They have one child, Princess Aiko, who was born in 2001. But Japanese law prohibits women from inheriting the throne. Empress Masako has struggled to cope with royal life and the pressure to produce a male heir. She reportedly suffers from a stress disorder, and admitted last year that she was ""insecure"" about becoming empress. However, she has pledged to do her best to serve the people of Japan.

In fact, Japanese emperors used to be seen as gods, but Emperor Hirohito - Naruhito's grandfather - publicly renounced his divinity at the end of World War Two, as part of Japan's surrender. Today, the role is largely ceremonial and the emperor is barred from making any political statements. Emperor Emeritus Akihito went through the abdication ceremonies a day earlier Emperor Akihito is seen as having redefined the role, helping to repair the damage to Japan's reputation after the war.

Battle to save remote machines,"Link is increasing the fee it pays cash machine operators to keep remote free-to-use machines available. Operators will be offered up to Â£2.75 per withdrawal to persuade them to keep at-risk machines free. ""It is vital we continue to provide free access to cash to those who need it,"" said Link chief John Howells. But Jenni Allen of Which? said: ""Boosting premiums for remote machines has so far not been enough to stop cashpoints closing around the country."" Many of the machines are in deprived areas where cash use is higher, which means locals are hit if ATMs are withdrawn or a charge is introduced. Last year Which? claimed that 300 ATMs were closing a month, although the consumer group's analysis was disputed by Link. Link, the UK largest ATM network, said last summer that machines in remote locations could receive an extra subsidy, particularly if they are threatened with closure. Today it has announced a new super premium which will be introduced in April. Who do we trust after cash? Row intensifies over cash machines fee Thousands of cash machines may be axed It will be offered to around 3,500 free-to-use ATMs that are currently 1km or more away from the nearest free-to use ATM, with between 50 and 100 eligible for the full Â£2.75 subsidy. Currently, operators of eligible ATMs receive a top-up subsidy of up to 30p through Link's financial inclusion programme. ""These premiums will further safeguard ATMs in remote and less well-off areas,"" said Mr Howells. Karis Burns works at one of Britain's remotest cash machine locations One of Britain's remotest cash machines is on Britain's most northerly island, Unst. It's part of the Shetland Islands, north of Scotland and has an estimated population of 632. Karis Burns, pictured above, who works at P&T Coaches which houses the only cash machine on Unst, says: ""It's quite important to have a cash machine here, the only other place to get cash is at the local post office about half a mile away."" She said the machine is used ""about six or seven times a day, although in the summertime it's used a bit more"". The summer usage is boosted by tourists who visit Unst, although Karis admits: ""We're quite remote."" The cost of taking out cash at the machine is Â£1.99. According to Link, Britain's remotest free-to-use machine is at Lloyds Bank branch in St Mary's on the Isle of Scilly (pictured). It's 50km away from the next nearest ATM, at Penzance on the mainland, a ferry ride away. There's just one ferry operator which sails up to seven times a week, with the journey taking a minimum of 2 hours and 45 minutes. Link's move follows a row over plans for a phased reduction in interchange rates, the fee operators receive from banks. The fee is being cut from 25p to 20p over the next three years but the move which led to accusations that ""cash deserts"" could be created as operators shut less lucrative machines. There are more than 50,000 free-to-use ATMs across the UK - and the vast majority will not be eligible for the new super premiums. Currently, around 3,500 ATMs are protected - because they are more than 1km away from the next nearest free machine or are located in particularly deprived parts of the country where access to cash is vital. Around Â£100bn is spent in shops using coins and notes every year, according to the Federation of Small Businesses. Its national chairman Mike Cherry said the launch of the super-premiums ""highlight the fundamental failures of our ATM market"". He said: ""The Payment Systems Regulator must now intervene and help the industry formulate a long-term strategy for maintaining free access to cash right across the UK."" Ms Allen of Which? Money agreed, saying:  ""What is urgently needed is for a regulator to be given a duty to protect access to cash, so that the millions of people who rely on it in their lives are protected from rapid changes through ATM and bank branch closures.""

Baby death mum 'scared' of using hospital,"Sarah Handy was discharged from hospital with painkillers then baby daughter Jennifer died after she was born suddenly at home A mother whose baby died after failures at a hospital at the centre of a damning report has said she still has no faith in its maternity services. Sarah Handy was sent home with painkillers and laxatives before giving birth to Jennifer, who died a short time later. A highly-critical report said maternity services,externalat Royal Glamorgan and Prince Charles hospitals were ""dysfunctional"". Cwm Taf health board said it understood people's anxieties. The independent review found services for expectant and new mothers were ""under extreme pressure"" with patients' worries often ignored. It was prompted by concerns over the deaths of a number of babies. After the report uncovered numerous failings, Health Minister Vaughan Gething put Cwm Taf maternity services into special measures. Mrs Handy said: ""I've lost all confidence and trust in the service. I would be very, very scared to use the services again. There are a lot of questions that need to be answered."" This video can not be played 'We picked the wrong day to be ill' Ms Handy's case was one of those highlighted in the accompanying report, which carried concerns expressed by women and families over the quality of care they received. The review team said her case included at least five failings in how the maternity service responded and dealt with her in April 2017. Ms Handy, from Merthyr Tydfil, wants to see more staff and more safeguards in place: ""Doctors, midwives, across the board really, listening to patients and patients feeling much more valued."" Maternity services in special measures Q&A: What's the background at Cwm Taf? Mums 'ignored and made to feel worthless' Health minister rejects call to quit Samantha Gadsden said, despite improvements, there were still staffing issues Meanwhile, doula Samantha Gadsden - a birth companion to pregnant women - said she saw some ""pretty horrible things"" while working in Cwm Taf. ""Coerced vaginal examinations, lack of informed consent, free-birthing women - choosing to give birth without a midwife - being reported to social services and I witnessed a midwife lose her temper and walk out of a house with a baby without telling the parents,"" said Ms Gadsen. ""One of my clients was criticised for her choice to free birth while her baby was there fitting in the hospital and she was there still being told off by the consultant."" Ms Gadsden told BBC Wales she was ""shocked"" the problems have only just come to light, but insists there have been improvements. ""There was a time when I would literally put my head in my hands knowing I was going to be working in that health board but that is no longer the case. ""There are new consultant midwives, there's the new birth centre there, so things are changing."" Unison Cymru's head of health Paul Summers said there was a problem with staffing levels and a blame culture meant staff had been too scared to speak out - and those that did, did not feel they were listened to. ""There's a big job to do in rebuilding the trust and confidence of staff,"" he added. Dr Clea Harmer, chief executive at Sands, the stillbirth and neonatal death charity, said: ""It is incredibly sad that for so many parents the first time they truly feel their voice has been heard, since suffering the devastation of the death of their baby, is a report into failings at a maternity unit that may have led to that bereavement."" She highlighted the testimony of one mother, who recalled a woman coming in and saying ""'Just to let you know the baby's died.' She didn't break it gently. Then she just walked away."" This video can not be played Jessica Western says she is still fighting to find out why her daughter Macie died Cwm Taf Morgannwg health board had already been planning changes and since March, specialist neonatal care is now only provided on one site - Prince Charles Hospital. The Royal Glamorgan still has a midwife-led unit for less complicated births. Chief executive Allison Williams said:  ""We completely understand the anxiety people may be feeling and we would encourage people to talk to their community midwife to ensure that they have their questions answered."" She offered a public apology saying she was ""deeply sorry for the failings"" identified. She said the health board fully accepted the findings and putting things right was now the organisation's utmost priority. ""Some of the feedback we have received from patients is extremely distressing,"" she added. ""I would also like to say sorry to our staff who have felt that their concerns have not been listened to.""

Apple iPhone sales drop at record pace,"Sales of Apple's iPhones fell at their steepest-ever rate, according to data for the three months to the end of March. The firm said revenue from the iPhone dropped by 17%, compared with the same period a year earlier, to $31bn. However, Apple chief executive Tim Cook said sales were stronger towards the end of March, including in China where it cut iPhone prices to boost demand. Apple lifted its outlook for the three months to June. That sent shares more than 5% higher in after-hours trading. The companyhad warned of slowing iPhone sales earlier this year, especially in China, where Apple competes with cheaper rivals such as Huawei Technologies and Xiaomi.

But Mr Cook said price adjustments in China, lower Chinese taxes on the iPhone and new trade-in and financing deals helped sales start to recover toward the end of the quarter. He also credited improving demand for products such as the Apple Watch, along with progress in US-China trade talks. Apple chief executive Tim Cook and Oprah Winfrey at the launch of Apple TV+ in March ""The trade relationship, versus the previous quarter, is better. The tone is better,"" Mr Cook told Reuters. ""The sum of all of this together, it helped us."" Apple has lifted its guidance for its third quarter revenue to between $52.5bn and $54.5bn. For the three months to March, total sales hit $58bn compared to analysts' estimates of $57.3bn. However, that is below total sales of $61.1bn in the second quarter last year. And while demand improved in China, sales in the region were still down by 20%. Profits for the second quarter fell to $11.5bn compared to $13.8bn in the same period a year ago. Apple is attempting to shift its reliance on the iPhone towards services and last month unveiled its new TV streaming platform, Apple TV+, to take on the likes of more established companies such as Netflix. Services revenue rose to $11.4bn from $9.8bn in the same quarter last year. But Yoram Wurmser, principal analyst at eMarketer, said long-term growth in services and, to a less extent, other devices ""depend on having as many users as possible in the Apple ecosystem, and that's still primarily about the iPhone"". ""The long-term growth of the company still depends directly and indirectly on iPhone sales,"" he added.

Defibrillator hope after marathon death,"This video can not be played Ben McDonald's death was ""out of the blue"" ""He was really fit, really healthy, there was no indication that was going to happen."" Ben McDonald, 25, died after going into cardiac arrest at the finish line of the Cardiff Half Marathon in October 2018. A defibrillator was used and although it did not save him, his family want more of them in public places. A coroner's report concluded he died fromsudden arrhythmic death syndrome,external(SADs). ""He was very special,"" said Ben's mother Ruth McDonald, from the Vale of Glamorgan. ""He was just gorgeous, funny, happy, always smiling, he just wanted every moment to be special. ""One of his favourite mottos is 'happiness is only real when shared' and he just loved being with people."" Ben McDonald loved snowboarding and spent two seasons in the Alps Ben's brother Andrew said he loved being active. ""He was just extremely sporty, extremely active, he loved being outdoors, he loved playing, everything you can hurt yourself doing,"" Andrew said. The youngest of four children, Ben had worked at the Cardiff White Water Centre since the age of 16 and was also a qualified teacher. Ruth McDonald said her son was ""always smiling"" The 25-year-old was part of a group of seven who took part in the annually-held half marathon race, along with his girlfriend, his brother Steve and his wife, Andrew and his wife and his sister's husband. They had been ""planning it for months"" and were ""getting quite competitive"". ""It all started so happy, it was a beautiful sunny day, he ran the race, he exceeded the time he set for himself, he beat one of his brothers and then he collapsed as he crossed the finish line,"" Ruth said. ""He died more or less straight away."" Ruth said medics used CPR and a defibrillator, but he could not be saved. ""He was really fit, really healthy, there was no indication that was going to happen,"" she said. ""I think what we've learnt is life is unpredictable, we don't know what lies around the corner. Ben McDonald (third in from the left) ran the Cardiff Half Marathon with family members ""Screening might have saved Ben, it might not have done. A defibrillator could have saved Ben, but it didn't. ""But we really endorse the fact that we need defibrillators everywhere, so that people can get instant or as instant help as possible and screening might show things up. ""So it's important young people getting involved in sports activities have their hearts checked over."" She added: ""We didn't think this would happen to us... Ben was going to be fine and we'd see him get married and have children and get old and that didn't happen. ""Enjoy every moment with your children because you never know which moment is the last moment and family life is precious, tell those you love, you love them."" Half marathon pair died of 'natural causes' Race death family retrace final steps Donors raise Â£13k after race deaths A second man, Dean Fletcher, 32, from Exeter,also died at the event after crossing the finishing linewithin minutes of Ben on 7 October. In the wake of Ben's death, his charity page, in aid of Maternity Africa in north Tanzania, received hundreds of donations, raising almost Â£21,000 for the charity. The family have since all had heart screening and want to help raise awareness of the importance of defibrillators in public places. Andrew said: ""It's so stereotypical to be like 'he was a great guy, he was lovely, everyone loved him', but he was. He was above and beyond that."" He added: ""It was just so out of the blue, it could happen to anybody, our motto was live for that moment. The family all have a tattoo, similar to one Ben also had, showing the things he loved ""You can't live your life scared, but there are things you can do, wear a helmet if you're out snowboarding, if you can get your heart checked out, get it checked out. ""If it saves one person's life [heart screening] that's good, because it's not just the person who dies that suffers, everybody suffers and that's the hardest part."" Vicki Edwards, Ben's sister said they are trying to do ""things that he loved"". Among the plans is a festival style event, BenJam, which will be held on Thursday evening as a ""way to remember his birthday"". Money raised from ticket sales will go to the Welsh Hearts charity. Vicki said over 200 people have bought tickets and they hope to make it an annual event. The Welsh Governmentsaid it has provided funding totalling,externalÂ£586,000 for a project called Save a Life Cymru, which aims to improve access to CPR training and increase the awareness and use of defibrillators.

Maduro claims victory over 'coup' attempt,"This video can not be played Opposition leader Juan GuaidÃ³ is appealing to the military for support Venezuela's President NicolÃ¡s Maduro says he has defeated an ""attempted coup"" by opposition leader Juan GuaidÃ³. Dozens of National Guardsmen sided with the opposition in clashes on Tuesday that injured more than 100 people. But in a defiant TV address, President Maduro said Mr GuaidÃ³ had failed to turn the military against him. Mr GuaidÃ³ insists that Mr Maduro has lost control of the armed forces. The opposition leader called for more streets protests on Wednesday. ""Today we continue,"" he tweeted. ""We will keep going with more strength than ever, Venezuela."" Venezuela crisis in 300 words Who is Juan GuaidÃ³? Profile: NicolÃ¡s Maduro Mr GuaidÃ³ has been recognised as interim leader of Venezuela by more than 50 countries, including the US, the UK and most in Latin America. The US reiterated its support for Mr GuaidÃ³ on Wednesday, with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo saying ""military action is possible"" if necessary. But Mr Maduro, backed by Russia, China and the top of the country's military, has refused to cede leadership to his rival. Mr Pompeo is scheduled to speak with Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Wednesday, National Security Adviser John Bolton said. In his televised address, flanked by military commanders, Mr Maduro accused protesters of ""serious crimes"" which he said would ""not go unpunished"". Both the president and Mr GuaidÃ³ have called on their supporters to take to the streets, setting up more potential violent unrest in a nation already beset by economic crisis, chronic power cuts and widespread food shortages. This video can not be played Venezuela's President NicolÃ¡s Maduro defiant in speech Mr Maduro lashed out again at the United States, which he accuses of plotting against him. He dismissed a claim by the US that he had a plane ready on the tarmac to take him to Cuba, a staunch supporter of the beleaguered president. ""They had an airplane on the tarmac,"" Mr Pompeo said. ""He was ready to leave this morning [Tuesday], as we understand it. Russians indicated he should stay."" A three-minute video by Mr GuaidÃ³ published in the early hours of Tuesday showed him standing alongside a number of men in military uniform. He announced that he had the support of ""brave soldiers"" in the capital, Caracas. He urged Venezuelans to join them in the streets, and appeared alongside another opposition leader, Leopoldo LÃ³pez, who had been under house arrest since 2014. This video can not be played ""This is unstoppable,"" says Carlos Vecchio, Juan Guaido's envoy to the US Supporters on both sides then gathered in different places of Caracas throughout the day, and there were clashes between Mr GuaidÃ³'s supporters and armed military vehicles. Protesters were also seen throwing rocks, but being repelled by tear gas and water cannon. At one stage a military vehicle was filmed driving into protesters. Mr GuaidÃ³, the president of the opposition-controlled National Assembly, has called on Venezuela's military to back him ever since he declared himself interim president in January. He argues that President Maduro is a ""usurper"" because he was re-elected in polls that had been widely disputed. Is there a new cult of personality in Venezuela? 'Like living in the apocalypse' The bridge of desperation Tuesday marked the most violent episode of the Venezuelan political crisis this year. Venezuelan health officials said 69 people were injured in the clashes, including two with bullet wounds. Broadcasts from a number of news agencies, including the BBC and CNN, were apparently suspended amid the violence. An opposition demonstrator stands next to a burned out bus in Caracas Later on Tuesday, it emerged Mr LÃ³pez had sought safety in the Chilean, then the Spanish embassy, along with his family. The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued an emergency prohibition against all US carriers flying below 26,000ft in Venezuelan airspace. It also said all US operators should leave the country within 48 hours, due to increasing political instability. One sidebar to the Venezuela story is the battle for influence between the US and Russia. It's a battle that, for now at least, Russia seems to be winning. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was quick to accuse Russia of meddling, insisting that its government had persuaded President Maduro to abandon plans to flee to Havana. While the US has firmly backed the Venezuelan opposition leader Russia has thrown its weight behind Mr Maduro - vetoing a US resolution calling for fresh Venezuelan elections and offering considerable practical assistance - medicines, grain supplies and unspecified military support. Russia's support for Venezuela has been long-standing. And it's not just a matter of strategic rivalry with Washington, corporate interests in Moscow and individuals close to President Putin have large stakes in Venezuela's oil industry. UN Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres has appealed for both sides to avoid violence. The US reiterated its support for Mr GuaidÃ³. In a television interview on Wednesday, Mr Pompeo said Washington would prefer a peaceful transition of power but stated that ""military action is possible"". ""If that's what's required, that's what the United States will do,"" the US Secretary of State said. President Donald Trump said he was monitoring events in Venezuela ""very closely"" and said the US stood with the Venezuelan people and their freedom. He also threatened to implement the ""highest-level sanctions"" and a ""full and complete embargo"" against Cuba unless its military immediately ceased its support of Mr Maduro. Governments who still support Mr Maduro, including Bolivia and Cuba, condemned Mr GuaidÃ³'s efforts as an attempted ""coup d'etat"". The Mexican government expressed ""concern about a possible increase in violence"" while Colombian President Ivan Duque urged the Venezuelan military to stand ""on the right side of history"" against Mr Maduro.

'New-build homes not fire safe',"Houses developed by Persimmon Homes and Bellway Homes have potentially dangerous fire safety issues, BBC Watchdog Live has found. New-builds constructed by the firms were sold with missing or incorrectly installed fire barriers, which are designed to inhibit the spread of fire. In some cases, it's thought a lack of fire barriers contributed to the spread of fires that have destroyed homes. Persimmon Homes and Bellway Homes both said they were addressing the issue. Building Regulations require that by law new homes are built with fire protection measures to delay the spread of fire and allow crucial time for escape. In many new builds, particularly timber-framed buildings, fire barriers are a vital part of this fire protection. The barriers are used to form a complete seal between different areas of a home, and without them, experts say, fire and smoke can spread five to ten times faster. Fire barriers are an ""integral safety feature"" says Andrew Mellor ""A comparison is if you were to buy a new car and you ultimately found that it didn't have an airbag in it [â¦] It's an integral safety feature within the home,"" said industry expert Andrew Mellor. Responsibility for ensuring that buildings are compliant with Building Regulations ultimately lies with the house builder. In the cases the BBC has uncovered, serious breaches have gone undetected during construction, leaving homes and lives potentially at risk if fire breaks out. Sarah Dennis is a resident at the Persimmon Homes Greenacres development in Exeter, where, in April 2018, a fire started by a cigarette dropped at ground level spread up to the roof of a house, and then to the adjacent properties. ""Neighbours asked if we could smell smoke. Went inside to check on the kids, there was smoke in the bedroom, Firemen arrived within a couple of minutes. Just a bit of smoke coming from the back and the next minute it was engulfed in flames,"" she said. Subsequent investigations by Persimmon Homes found missing fire barriers at 37% of homes on the Greenacres estate. This triggered a huge inspection programme of thousands of homes across the South West region, where more than 650 homes were found to have missing or incorrectly installed fire barriers. Some of these issues have not yet been rectified - and some homes have still not been inspected. Sarah Dennis is a resident at the Persimmon Homes Greenacres development in Exeter Outside the South West, in Coventry, a Persimmon Homes building containing some 48 apartments was evacuated in 2018, following the discovery of a number of defects including missing fire barriers. Some residents are still living in temporary accommodation while retrofitting and other works are carried out. Persimmon Homes confirmed that, since the issues in the South West came to light in 2018,  it has written to 3200 home owners in the region, and has set up a ""dedicated team"" to carry out inspections. It said that, in total, 2700 properties have been inspected, and remedial work has been carried out at 679 homes. The company said sample checks were also being conducted nationwide, saying ""if these inspections indicate that we need to inspect every timber frame property then we will do so."" ""This should not have happened and we would like to apologise to all affected homeowners and assure them that we are doing everything we can to rectify the issue swiftly,"" it added. BBC Watchdog Live also uncovered potentially dangerous fire safety issues in developments in Kent and West Lothian built by Bellway Homes. In 2015, a fire took hold in a block of Bellway Homes flats in Canterbury, Kent, and spread through dozens of properties, destroying or damaging 45 of them. Subsequent inspections highlighted concerns over fire stopping in the wall cavities. Residents at the Old Tannery development have since been moved out while ""improvement works"" to address these fire safety issues are carried out at their homes. Surveyor Greig Adamo found poorly fitted fire barriers at Bellway Homes in West Lothian In Scotland, BBC Watchdog Live sent its own expert surveyor to a new build Bellway Homes development in West Lothian, to examine the fire protection at four houses, after concerns were raised by one resident whose house had previously been found to have inadequate fire barriers. Surveyor and expert witness Greig Adams, who carried out the testing, found poorly fitted fire barriers at all four properties, with voids and gaps around them that would prevent them stopping fire from spreading. He said that the homes are not fire safe: ""What we've unfortunately found is that there are fire breach issues in every house we've looked at. It's a legal requirement that the cavity barriers are to be there. It's not optional- and with good reason: it saves lives"" Bellway Homes said it was ""committed to improvement"". ""Mandatory training on many subjects, including fire stopping, has been introduced for all applicable construction staff and we remain committed to building quality homes in accordance with all relevant regulation,"" it added. Bellway Home also said that until last week, it was only aware of one property on the development in West Lothian where concerns with cavity barriers had been raised. ""As a responsible builder, Bellway takes our customer's safety extremely seriously and we will investigate and address any raised concerns immediately, where there is perceived to be an imminent danger to persons or property,"" it said. It said that the investigation into the fire at the Old Tannery in Kent was ""inconclusive""- and that, following the fire, ""further remedial works were subsequently identified"" at the development, which it is working closely with the National House-Building Council to complete.

Man sued for rape declared bankrupt,"Stephen Coxen had denied the rape charges against him and the case was found not proven in a criminal court A woman who successfully sued a man for raping her has said she is ""shocked"" but ""not surprised"" that he has declared himself bankrupt. Last October a sheriff ruled that Stephen Coxen had raped the woman after a night out in Fife in 2013 and ordered him to pay her Â£80,000. The case was unusual because Mr Coxen had previously faced a criminal trial but the case was found not proven. Stephen Coxen, 25, declared himself bankrupt in February. The woman, a former St Andrews University student who cannot be named for legal reasons, said she was raped after a night out in the town by Mr Coxen, whom she had met earlier in the evening. The victim was a student at the University of St Andrews Mr Coxen, from Bury in Greater Manchester, had denied the charges, claiming the sex was consensual. The case was found not proven, which means in legal terms that he was cleared, after a criminal trial in November 2015. Woman wins Â£80k damages after rape civil case Should the not proven verdict be scrapped? The woman, known as Miss M, later took out a civil action against Stephen Coxen, which was heard at the Personal Injury Court in Edinburgh. Speaking to BBC Radio'sGood Morning Scotlandprogramme, the woman said her main focus had been gaining justice in the case and not money. She said: ""Initially, the day I found out I was very shocked. I wasn't surprised. ""I think a little part of me always thought he might do this. He was the man that raped me, he is the man I've spent five years fighting against and I think it's just highlighting the type of person that he is. ""But I don't think people should just think about this as terrible that he's made himself bankrupt, because really, I've never wanted to go after him for money. ""The whole point of my whole process - my whole fight over the years is really just for a sheriff to say 'you know he did rape you - this did happen'."" Damages were awarded at the Personal Injury Court in Edinburgh Civil cases require a lower standard of proof than criminal cases, with judgements made on the balance of probabilities rather than beyond reasonable doubt. In this case - understood to be the first of its kind in Scotland -  the sheriff in the civil court ruled Mr Coxen raped the woman despite the not proven verdict in the criminal court, and demanded he pay damages. Sheriff Robert Weir said the evidence from Miss M had been ""cogent, compelling and persuasive"". He said that Mr Coxen took advantage of the 18-year-old student when she was incapable of giving meaningful consent because of the effects of alcohol. David Robertson (left) and David Goodwillie faced a civil action after a decision not to prosecute them The sheriff said Miss M had been distressed and had resisted, but Mr Coxen had continued to rape her. Mr Coxen, who was also aged 18 at the time, denied rape and said they had consensual sex. In 2017, another woman, Denise Clair,won a civil case against footballers David Goodwillie and David Robertson. But the case was different as Ms Clair, who waived her right to anonymity, brought the civil action after the Crown had decided against prosecuting the pair in the criminal courts. The judge in the civil court found the rapes had happened and awarded Ms Clair Â£100,000 damages from the men.

US cop guilty of murdering Australian,"Mohamed Noor was taken into custody upon his conviction A former policeman in the US state of Minnesota has been found guilty of murdering an unarmed Australian woman. Mohamed Noor shot Justine Ruszczyk Damond as she approached his patrol car to report a possible rape behind her Minneapolis home on 15 July 2017. Noor, 33, testified last week that he opened fire because he feared he and his partner were being ambushed. Ms Damond, 40, a yoga instructor from Sydney, was engaged and was due to marry a month after the shooting. The death drew international criticism and Australia's prime minister at the time, Malcolm Turnbull, said it was ""inexplicable"". Noor was handcuffed and taken into custody immediately upon being convicted by a jury on Tuesday of third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. He was acquitted of the most serious charge of second-degree murder with intent to kill. Justine Damond The trial heard the victim, a dual US-Australian citizen, lay dying from a gunshot wound just over a minute after ending a phone conversation with her fiance. She had told Don Damond that police had just arrived after she called them to report a possible sexual assault in the alley behind their home. No such attack was ever found to have occurred. Noor took the stand last week to say he recalled seeing a blonde female in a pink T-shirt approach his squad car on the night of the shooting. Australia grief over 'American nightmare' He said he believed there was an imminent threat after he heard a loud bang and saw Ms Damond with her right arm raised. Noor said his partner, Officer Matthew Harrity, shouted ""Oh Jesus!"" and fumbled with his gun in its holster before ""he turned to me with fear in his eyes"". The defendant said he ""had to make a split-second decision"" and shot Ms Damond across his partner through the car window. This video can not be played Justine Damond's family hold a silent vigil at a beach in Sydney last year Noor told the court that upon realising he had shot an unarmed woman he ""felt like my whole world came crashing down"". Prosecutors questioned whether the loud bang was real, pointing out that neither Noor nor his partner initially mentioned anything at the scene about hearing such a noise. Ms Damond's fingerprints were not found on the squad car, the court heard. She had moved to the Midwestern city to marry her boyfriend, Don Damond, and had adopted his surname ahead of their nuptials. Mr Damond was in Las Vegas, Nevada, when investigators called him to say she was dead. Noor joined the police force in 2015 He told the court he learned from a second phone call that she had been shot by a police officer. Mr Damond said contacting her family in Australia to tell them the news was the ""worst phone call"" he ever had to make. Noor is a former Somalian refugee whose family moved to the US and settled in Minneapolis. He joined the police force in 2015, but was sacked after being charged in the shooting. The fallout also cost Minneapolis Police Chief JaneÃ© Harteau her job and was a factor in the election defeat of the city's mayor a few months later. The Damond family have filed a civil lawsuit against the city and several police officers seeking $50m (Â£38m) in damages. Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo apologised to Damond's friends and family in a statement released after Tuesday's verdict was read. ""This was indeed a sad and tragic incident that has affected family, friends, neighbours, the City of Minneapolis and people around the world, most significantly in her home country of Australia,"" he said.

'No plans' for Jussie Smollett Empire return,"There are ""no plans"" for Jussie Smollett to return to the sixth season of Empire, TV network Fox says. The actor, who plays Jamal, was accused of staging a racist and homophobic attack on himself in January - which he's always denied. He was charged with allegedly lying to police, but Chicago prosecutors later dropped the case. The decision was criticised by Chicago authorities, with Mayor Rahm Emanuel calling it a ""whitewash of justice"". Smollett's character was removed from the final two episodes of season five and now it looks unlikely he will return for the new season. In a statement, Fox said: ""By mutual agreement, the studio has negotiated an extension to Jussie Smollett's option for season six, but at this time there are no plans for the character of Jamal to return to Empire.""

Windrush policies 'broke equalities law',"The Empire Windrush arrived at Tilbury Docks, Essex, on 22 June 1948 MPs have reported the Home Office to the equalities watchdog over the Windrush scandal, accusing it of unlawful discrimination. The group of 87 says the Home Office discriminated as a ""direct result"" of so-called hostile environment policies. The letter to the Equalities and Human Rights Commission claims the government broke, and is breaking, equalities law. The Home Office said it was ""committed to righting the wrongs experienced by the Windrush generation"". 'No cap' on compensation claims Formal apology to Windrush members Has the 'hostile environment' worked? The Windrush scandal involved the wrongful detentions and deportations of some members of the Windrush generation - the thousands of people who travelled to the UK from the Caribbean in the years after World War Two. In the letter, David Lammy - chair of the all party parliamentary group on race - says the Home Office is acting in breach of equalities legislation by ""routinely"" discriminating on the basis of Britons' race. It adds: ""Clearly, the Windrush scandal represents one of the gravest breaches of equality law and the rights of British citizens in recent memory."" This video can not be played Windrush scandal: One year on An estimated 500,000 people now living in the UK, who arrived between 1948 and 1971 from Caribbean countries, have been called the Windrush generation, in reference to a ship which brought workers to the UK in 1948. They were granted indefinite leave to remain in 1971 but thousands were children travelling on their parents' passports, without their own documents. Changes to immigration law in 2012 meant those without documents were asked for evidence to continue working, access services or even to remain in the UK. Some were held in detention or removed, despite living in the country for decades. A review by a Home Office taskforce of 11,800 Caribbean cases identified164 who were deported or detainedwho might have been resident in the UK before 1973. The taskforce has traced 137 of those people, of whom 19 are known to have died. At least 18 would receive a formal apology,the government said last year.This month, the government said there was ""no cap"" onpossible compensation for those affected. Many of the new arrivals were children In the letter, the MPs call on the commission to look into how the Home Office contributed to the government's ""hostile environment"" policy and its impact on the Windrush generation. They also argue the Home Office breached the public sector equality duty, which means public bodies have to have ""due regard"" to eliminate discrimination and advance equality. The signatories are from six different parties, with most from Labour and none from the Conservatives. They include shadow home secretary Diane Abbott, Green Party MP Caroline Lucas, Luciana Berger from The Independent Group, the SNP's Alison Thewliss and Liberal Democrat Alistair Carmichael. This video can not be played Glenda Caesar wants compensation for loss of earnings, stress, and lost pension Mr Lammy said: ""The gross mishandling and abuse of the Windrush generation by the Home Office raises serious questions over whether British citizens were discriminated against on the basis of their race and ethnicity, in breach of equalities legislation. ""More than a year after I first raised this in Parliament, nothing has changed. Justice must mean not only due compensation and reparation, but changes to the institution and immigration laws that created this crisis."" The ""hostile environment"" approach to curbing illegal immigration has been blamed for members of the Windrush generation, who were in the UK legally, being wrongly threatened with deportation. The letter said the policy was ""deeply discriminatory"", arguing that black Britons are being discriminated against, while white Britons are not. A Home Office spokeswoman said: ""The home secretary and the immigration minister are committed to righting the wrongs experienced by the Windrush generation and the recently launched compensation scheme is a crucial step in delivering on that commitment. ""The Windrush generation have given so much to this country and we will ensure nothing like this ever happens again, that is why the home secretary commissioned a lessons learned review with independent oversight by Wendy Williams.""

Police probe motorhome fraud claimsCustomers of Gill's Motorhomes say they lost large sums of money after the company ceased trading.Scotland business,"This video can not be played Motorhome owner Alan Nicoll recalls the ""terrible time"" he had during a finance dispute Police are investigating claims that a West Lothian motorhome firm duped customers and business associates out of hundreds of thousands of pounds. BBC Scotland has learned that dozens of Gill's Motorhomes clients are owed substantial sums for vehicle hire bookings that never materialised. Several customers also claim they lost thousands after buying used vehicles that were still owned by finance firms. And two men claim to have lost tens of thousands over a failed franchise plan. Gill's Motorhomes, which has now ceased trading, told BBC Scotland that all of its customers who prepaid to hire a vehicle would receive a full refund. The Dechmont-based company, whose sole director is David Gill, also said it aimed to ""recompense"" two businessmen who each invested close to Â£100,000 in planned Gill's-branded franchise operations in England ""as and when we are able"". In a statement, police said they were ""investigating reports of a fraudulent scheme linked to a business in Dechmont, West Lothian"". Alan Nicoll says he had to pay a finance company Â£10,000 or lose his motorhome BBC Scotland traced a number of Gill's customers, all of whom claimed to have lost thousands of pounds. Alan Nicoll, from East Kilbride, and Fort William-based Ingrid Anderson both bought ex-hire motorhomes from Gill's - only to discover later that the vehicles were still subject to leasing agreements. In October Mr Nicoll, 55, paid Gill's a Â£5,000 deposit for a motorhome before finding out a few days later that there was outstanding finance on the vehicle. He said he agreed to pay Gill's the outstanding balance of Â£32,000 after receiving assurances from the firm that it would clear the debt with the finance company as soon as it received his money. In emails seen by BBC Scotland, Mr Nicoll was repeatedly told by Gill's that the issue was being addressed. But the finance company did not receive the money. In March, it informed Mr Nicoll that Gill's had ceased trading and that it wanted to recover the vehicle. Mr Nicoll said: ""I decided to reach a settlement and paid the finance company Â£10,000. ""Between my partner and myself, it was a terrible time. ""You can understand a business going underneath, but for them to do what they did was just lowlife."" Mrs Anderson shows the receipt for her purchase of a used motorhome Ingrid Anderson, who is in her 60s, told BBC Scotland that she paid Gill's company Motorhome Hire Scotland Â£35,000 for a second-hand Bailey Advance 655 in late 2017. But when she tried to sell it a few months ago, a dealer informed her that there was still a lease agreement on the vehicle. Mrs Anderson claimed she was later told by the finance company involved that she would have to pay an outstanding balance of Â£20,500 or it would repossess the vehicle. She said she tried to resolve the matter with Gill's but the company went silent at the end of February. ""I was devastated when I discovered there was a lease agreement on the motorhome and I could lose it,"" she said. ""My lawyer is currently reviewing the legal position and I have informed the police about my case."" Ingrid Anderson faces a bill of more than Â£20,000 in order to keep her motorhome A statement emailed to the BBC by Gill's Motorhomes read: ""Historically every year since inception we have sold off our ex-hire motorhomes and in the majority of cases we paid off the finance owed on them. ""Regrettably due to a variety of unforeseen circumstances the business was unable to continue trading and as a direct result of those circumstances it rendered it impossible for us to make the final finance payments on three vehicles."" A number of people also came forward to the BBC to say they had lost substantial sums trying to rent motorhomes from Gill's. Derek Burke paid Gill's Â£1,472 upfront after being offered an ""early bird"" rental discount on 23 February. Derek Burke set up an online group for people who lost money after dealing with Gill's Motorhomes Mr Burke, from Burntisland, said he only found out that there might be a problem when he tried to alter the rental dates several weeks later. He told BBC Scotland: ""We tried to contact them (Gill's) several times by phone to rearrange the dates, to see if that was possible but there was no answer on the phone. ""So I emailed them and again there was no answer."" Mr Burke set up an online group and found others with similar accounts of dealings with Gill's. So far more than a dozen have come forward. He said: ""There were several people posting who had booked with Gill's Motorhome Hire Scotland and they couldn't get hold of anyone - the same situation I was in. And they had paid upfront as well. ""There's an awful lot of anger, as you can imagine."" Mr Burke has also approached the police over his case. This page from Gill's Motorhomes was removed several weeks ago Two Spaniards have also claimed to have lost substantial amounts of money in their dealings with Gill's. Xavi Pena, from Barcelona, said that in January he hired a motorhome from Gill's to travel around Scotland with his wife, two-year-old son and parents-in-law. He explained: ""We were asked to pay the full amount of Â£1,800 in order to lock the motorhome. ""That was clearly a mistake from our side, but we were keen to secure it given that my parents-in-law were travelling all the way from Australia, where they live. ""About 10 days before our trip I tried to contact the company again in order to agree on the pick-up location and time but they had vanished completely. ""Their website was not operative, they didn't answer emails or calls. In the end we had to rent another motorhome."" Santi Miralda says the company failed to respond after he tried to amend his booking Santi Miralda, 49, also from Barcelona, said he paid Gill's more than Â£1,500 upfront in February to rent a vehicle. Mr Miralda, who runs a language school in the Spanish city, said alarm bells started ringing when he tried to alter his booking a few weeks later. ""I tried to contact them (Motorhome Hire Scotland) to ask for a change and that was when I realised that I had been ripped off. ""The web page has disappeared and they do not answer any mail or phone calls."" BBC Scotland has established that the Gill's Motorhomes' website went offline in early March, with the message: ""Our site is currently unavailable."" In mid-April, a new message appeared, stating that Gill's Motorhome Hire Ltd had ceased trading. In a statement, Gill's Motorhomes said it took bookings in advance ""like any other motorhome hire company"". It continued: ""All of our customers who prepaid will receive a full refund, indeed most have already. ""Like any other business associated with travel we provided an 'early bird' discount for customers who paid in advance. We have offered this facility since inception in 2015. ""We notified our customers via email as soon as it became clear that we were unfortunately unable to continue trading. ""We provided clear and concise instructions on how our customers could get their money back. Most, if not all, have now successfully followed those instructions."" Chris Nowell, 56, from Stafford, claims he is about Â£90,000 out of pocket after signing a franchise agreement with Gill's Motorhomes last year. He said the fee of Â£75,000, plus VAT, included marketing and website costs involved in renting out Gills-branded vehicles in Birmingham from 1 April. Chris Nowell says he has lost about Â£90,000 over the franchise agreement with Gill's Mr Nowell, who is a former director of JCB, told the BBC that he had concerns back in February about how the franchise was proceeding and began a legal process of withdrawing from the agreement. However, on 1 March he received an email from Gill's saying that it had ceased trading. He says he has not received a penny of his money back. He told BBC Scotland: ""I feel that essentially I have been duped into taking on the franchise. ""I feel it was never a properly established franchise, and they weren't in a position to deliver what they promised when they started. ""I have lost so far a great deal of money but I also feel awful for the other people, particularly the people who were booking through the Gill's website for Birmingham where I was due to open a franchise. ""They've lost their holidays and they've lost, in some cases, their bookings."" Another ""franchisee"", Alan Amos, says he paid out about Â£100,000 late last year to take on a Gill's Motorhome hire franchise in Swindon. He also claims to have received nothing back from Gill's. He told BBC Scotland: ""I have to pay off a Â£50,000 loan and will have to sell off my house and downsize. I've also got to find a job. ""I can't figure out where all the money has gone. I have been stressed out in a way I have never been before."" In a statement, Gill's said: ""Two people progressed their intentions to proceed with our franchise model and they had invested funds in that regard. ""We had a very strong and sustainable franchise model which had been scrutinised by many industry professionals including representatives for both individuals concerned. ""A substantial investment was made by ourselves in our franchise model but very regrettably we were unable to sustain the costs associated with this business due to unforeseen circumstances. ""We are deeply disappointed with what has happened and we aim to recompense these people as and when we are able."" A Police Scotland spokeswoman said: ""We are investigating reports of a fraudulent scheme linked to a business in Dechmont, West Lothian. ""Inquiries are ongoing.""

Children's services 'at breaking point'MPs call for more than ÃÂ£3bn for children's services in England to end a funding crisis.Family & Education,"Children's services in England are at breaking point and need a Â£3.1bn minimum funding boost by 2025, MPs say. The Housing, Communities and Local Government Committee said current funding levels were unsustainable. Itsreport,externalsaid as services tried to respond to growing demand, amid severe funding pressures, many were reliant on the goodwill of staff. The government said Â£494m of funding would help children and social work improvements would reduce demand. The MPs said overall, England's local authorities had been grappling with budget cuts of 29% since 2010. The committee follows a long line of organisations, including councils, children's charities and economists, to raise the alarm over funding levels. In children's services, this has led managers to divert funds from the early-intervention non-statutory preventative services that can catch problems before they become crises, to statutory services, which they are obliged to provide by law, at the more severe end of need. Spending data from the National Audit Office (NAO) shows England's local authorities spent 59% of their children's services budget on statutory services in 2010-11. But by 2017-18, councils were spending 75% on statutory services. And despite this, budgets for statutory services in many areas were overspent. Earlier this year, the NAO found that 91% of councils had overspent the budgets they had set for children's services at the start of the year. This amounted to a national overspend of Â£872m. ""In recent months, a growing number of local authorities have suggested that they may only be able to provide core services in the future,"" the County Councils Network said. Clive Betts, who chairs the committee, said: ""Over the last decade we have seen a steady increase in the number of children needing support, whilst at the same time funding has failed to keep up. ""It is clear that this approach cannot be sustained and the government must make serious financial and systemic changes to support local authorities in helping vulnerable children. ""They must understand why demand is increasing and whether it can be reduced. ""They must ensure that the funding formula actually allows local authorities to meet the obligations for supporting children that the government places on them."" England's Children's Commissioner, Anne Longfield, said this situation was letting down many vulnerable children who were not receiving the help they needed. ""We cannot just continue to cross our fingers and hope that vulnerable children will be all right - and this report must be a final wake-up call to the government,"" she said. ""This year's Spending Review is the moment to act. Ministers must accept that children's services are in desperate need of funding to improve what they offer children rather than just stand still or go backwards."" The government said it aimed to help parents ""who face difficulties, to strengthen their family relationships so they can properly support their children"". A spokesperson said the government was putting an extra Â£410m into social care this year, including children's, alongside Â£84m over the next five years to keep more children at home with their families to reduce the demand on services. They said the number of children's services rated outstanding was growing, adding: ""To help continue this trend we are raising the bar in our social work profession, by focusing on improved training and recruitment."" But Kathy Evans, chief executive of Children England, said one very clear and urgent message emerged from the report. ""There is simply no getting away from the fact that austerity policies are leaving thousands of children and families and many essential local services at absolute breaking point.""

Ministers must accept that children's services are in desperate need of funding to improve what they offer children rather than just stand still or go backwards."" The government said it aimed to help parents ""who face difficulties, to strengthen their family relationships so they can properly support their children"". A spokesperson said the government was putting an extra Â£410m into social care this year, including children's, alongside Â£84m over the next five years to keep more children at home with their families to reduce the demand on services. They said the number of children's services rated outstanding was growing, adding: ""To help continue this trend we are raising the bar in our social work profession, by focusing on improved training and recruitment."" But Kathy Evans, chief executive of Children England, said one very clear and urgent message emerged from the report. ""There is simply no getting away from the fact that austerity policies are leaving thousands of children and families and many essential local services at absolute breaking point.""

Failed Asda bid cost Sainsbury's Â£46mThe supermarket chain reveals the cost of its failed Asda merger as it reports a slip in sales.Business,"The failed bid to merge with rival Asda cost Sainsbury's Â£46m, the supermarket giant has said. In April, a proposed merger between Sainsbury's and Asda was blocked by the UK's competition watchdog over fears it would raise prices for consumers. Sainsbury's said that like-for-like sales growth slowed in the fourth quarter, especially over the Christmas period. It added it would accelerate investment in its stores and technology. Fourth-quarter sales fell 0.9%, having fallen 1.1% over Christmas. In the year ending 9 March, profit before tax fell to Â£239m, from Â£409m the previous year. Costs for the year included the failed Asda bid, restructuring costs of Â£81m and defined benefit pension expenses of Â£118m. Retail analyst Steve Dressersaid in a tweet,externalthat the second half of the year was ""poor for Sainsbury's really"", taking into consideration ""Halloween, Christmas, Mother's Day, Valentine's Day, Comic Relief"" and a ""hot summer in first half too"". Sainsbury's chief executive Mike Coupe was not his usual Tiggerish self when presenting this set of results. He gave the impression of someone trying to make the best of a less-than-ideal outcome  - which, of course, he was. In his ideal world, he would have been talking about the final preparations for the merger with Asda, but that was blown out of the water by the Competition and Markets Authority last week. Instead, he was left to describe a fairly mundane set of annual results in glowing terms. They show a company that is fighting hard on all fronts - trying to compete against aggressive low-price rivals and a resurgent Tesco, while at the same time finding the money to improve its stores, reduce debt and maintain dividend payments to shareholders. Once you include restructuring costs and a Â£46m hit on the failed deal with Asda, statutory profits were down one-third to Â£219m - a tiny number for a company that has annual sales of Â£32bn. Sainsbury insiders had warned against expecting a big strategic relaunch, a Plan B after the Asda failure. Shareholders will still be disappointed that there wasn't one, and will no doubt be pressing hard on whether - or rather when - it will emerge. Chief executive Mike Coupe told the BBC's Today programme: ""Well, we draw a line under the past... The authorities blocked the [Asda] deal, but we think our business is adapting to the changing world of retail, and we will will carry on investing in our business."" Mr Coupe said Sainsbury's would invest in 400 supermarkets over the next year and would continue to put money into online sales. The investment will include refurbishment of some big stores, including Hedge End near Southampton. He added that he would be ""sticking to the company"" when questioned about whether he had been asked to step down after the failed merger. On a media call, he said ""I'm planning to stay,"" adding that shareholders and the board had been supportive. Sainsbury's shares took a big tumble in February after a preliminary decision against the merger by the competition watchdog, falling from 287.9p per share to 234.5p over the course of a day. The share price dipped as low as 216p in the last week of April. Laith Khalaf, a senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ""The market's been worried about Sainsbury's ever since the tie-up with Asda fell through, and while underlying performance hasn't been stellar, the supermarket's beaten expectations, and that's provided the share price with a much-needed fillip. ""However, it's a bit premature to pop any champagne corks just yet."" He said one-off costs had led to a ""steep decline"" in reported profits, adding that ""the supermarket's debt pile also looks pretty high, though the good news is the pension scheme has moved into surplus"". Mr Khalaf added: ""Perhaps most concerning is that sales growth is flatlining at best. In some bits of the business, notably clothing and general merchandise, sales are in retreat. Of course, this all contrasts with a resurgent Tesco, which makes Sainsbury's sales performance look pallid by comparison.""

'No plans' for Jussie Smollett Empire returnThe show is renewed for a sixth season but it's unlikely the actor's character Jamal will come back.Newsbeat,"There are ""no plans"" for Jussie Smollett to return to the sixth season of Empire, TV network Fox says. The actor, who plays Jamal, was accused of staging a racist and homophobic attack on himself in January - which he's always denied. He was charged with allegedly lying to police, but Chicago prosecutors later dropped the case. The decision was criticised by Chicago authorities, with Mayor Rahm Emanuel calling it a ""whitewash of justice"". Smollett's character was removed from the final two episodes of season five and now it looks unlikely he will return for the new season. In a statement, Fox said: ""By mutual agreement, the studio has negotiated an extension to Jussie Smollett's option for season six, but at this time there are no plans for the character of Jamal to return to Empire.""

They had worked as extras on Empire A few days later the brothers were released by police without charge and, on 20 February, Jussie Smollett was charged with filing a false police report Smollett was arrested and police say he paid the Osundairo brothers to stage the attack On 1 March the Osundairos said they ""regret"" their involvement in the incident Two weeks later, Smollett pleaded not guilty to 16 counts of disorderly conduct - and 12 days after that all charges against him were controversially dropped This video can not be played 27 March: The two sides in the Jussie Smollett case Police claimed the attack was planned by the actor as a publicity stunt but Smollett has always maintained his innocence.

"Defibrillator hope after marathon deathBen McDonald was ""really fit"" but died at the finish of the the Cardiff Half Marathon.Wales","This video can not be played Ben McDonald's death was ""out of the blue"" ""He was really fit, really healthy, there was no indication that was going to happen."" Ben McDonald, 25, died after going into cardiac arrest at the finish line of the Cardiff Half Marathon in October 2018. A defibrillator was used and although it did not save him, his family want more of them in public places. A coroner's report concluded he died fromsudden arrhythmic death syndrome,external(SADs). ""He was very special,"" said Ben's mother Ruth McDonald, from the Vale of Glamorgan. ""He was just gorgeous, funny, happy, always smiling, he just wanted every moment to be special. ""One of his favourite mottos is 'happiness is only real when shared' and he just loved being with people."" Ben McDonald loved snowboarding and spent two seasons in the Alps Ben's brother Andrew said he loved being active. ""He was just extremely sporty, extremely active, he loved being outdoors, he loved playing, everything you can hurt yourself doing,"" Andrew said. The youngest of four children, Ben had worked at the Cardiff White Water Centre since the age of 16 and was also a qualified teacher. Ruth McDonald said her son was ""always smiling"" The 25-year-old was part of a group of seven who took part in the annually-held half marathon race, along with his girlfriend, his brother Steve and his wife, Andrew and his wife and his sister's husband. They had been ""planning it for months"" and were ""getting quite competitive"". ""It all started so happy, it was a beautiful sunny day, he ran the race, he exceeded the time he set for himself, he beat one of his brothers and then he collapsed as he crossed the finish line,"" Ruth said. ""He died more or less straight away."" Ruth said medics used CPR and a defibrillator, but he could not be saved. ""He was really fit, really healthy, there was no indication that was going to happen,"" she said. ""I think what we've learnt is life is unpredictable, we don't know what lies around the corner. Ben McDonald (third in from the left) ran the Cardiff Half Marathon with family members ""Screening might have saved Ben, it might not have done. A defibrillator could have saved Ben, but it didn't. ""But we really endorse the fact that we need defibrillators everywhere, so that people can get instant or as instant help as possible and screening might show things up. ""So it's important young people getting involved in sports activities have their hearts checked over."" She added: ""We didn't think this would happen to us... Ben was going to be fine and we'd see him get married and have children and get old and that didn't happen. ""Enjoy every moment with your children because you never know which moment is the last moment and family life is precious, tell those you love, you love them."" Half marathon pair died of 'natural causes' Race death family retrace final steps Donors raise Â£13k after race deaths A second man, Dean Fletcher, 32, from Exeter,also died at the event after crossing the finishing linewithin minutes of Ben on 7 October. In the wake of Ben's death, his charity page, in aid of Maternity Africa in north Tanzania, received hundreds of donations, raising almost Â£21,000 for the charity. The family have since all had heart screening and want to help raise awareness of the importance of defibrillators in public places. Andrew said: ""It's so stereotypical to be like 'he was a great guy, he was lovely, everyone loved him', but he was. He was above and beyond that."" He added: ""It was just so out of the blue, it could happen to anybody, our motto was live for that moment. The family all have a tattoo, similar to one Ben also had, showing the things he loved ""You can't live your life scared, but there are things you can do, wear a helmet if you're out snowboarding, if you can get your heart checked out, get it checked out. ""If it saves one person's life [heart screening] that's good, because it's not just the person who dies that suffers, everybody suffers and that's the hardest part."" Vicki Edwards, Ben's sister said they are trying to do ""things that he loved"". Among the plans is a festival style event, BenJam, which will be held on Thursday evening as a ""way to remember his birthday"". Money raised from ticket sales will go to the Welsh Hearts charity. Vicki said over 200 people have bought tickets and they hope to make it an annual event. The Welsh Governmentsaid it has provided funding totalling,externalÂ£586,000 for a project called Save a Life Cymru, which aims to improve access to CPR training and increase the awareness and use of defibrillators.

'I was raped' by police officer ex-husbandPolice staff accused of domestic abuse are less likely than the general public to be convicted.UK,"This video can not be played 'Suzanne' says she believes her ex-husband was ""protected because of his job"" Police officers and staff accused of domestic abuse are a third less likely to be convicted than the general public, figures from 37 forces suggest. They show 3.9% of claims against police led to a conviction from 2015-18 in England and Wales, compared with 6.2% among the population as a whole. Police domestic abuse lead Dame Vera Baird said the issue does not ""appear to be taken as seriously"" as it should. The Home Office said it was bringing in reforms ""to improve police integrity"". Figures from the Freedom of Information request,conducted by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism (TBIJ),,externalalso found that more than four allegations of domestic abuse against police staff were recorded each week. Fewer than a quarter of those allegations led to disciplinary action. There are 200,000 members of the police workforce in England and Walesaccording to latest figures,external, of whom 122,000 are police officers. Suzanne - not her real name - told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme her ex-husband, a police officer, was violent towards her for years. She said she eventually called police when he threatened her with a knife, but they did very little. ""The police turned up and the only advice they gave him was he should leave the house and go for a walk to calm down. ""I don't remember them talking to me at all,"" she added. Suzanne said the violence escalated and her ex-husband hit their six-year-old son. When she filed for divorce, she said he raped her. She moved out with her children and reported him to his boss. Suzanne believes her ex-husband was ""protected because of his job"" A domestic abuse officer came to investigate, but Suzanne says they did not take a statement and no record was made on file. A few months later, her son was seen by a teacher being pushed into a car by his father. In a police interview - which Suzanne says she only saw four years later - her son said his father ""tried to strangle him and had his hands on his throat"", she said. No charges were brought against her ex-husband. She believes he was ""protected because of his job"". After years of suffering post-traumatic stress, she decided to go back to the police and obtain access to her police file, but she found nothing on record. The force said it would investigate her complaint but because there was nothing on file it closed the case. The police watchdog, the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), asked the force to reinvestigate Suzanne's case last year. And now 16 months later, the force has said it cannot uphold her complaint. Her husband has since retired but Suzanne now plans to sue the force - which cannot be named for legal reasons. The national domestic abuse charity SafeLives said the figures showed just ""the tip of the iceberg"". Chief executive Suzanne Jacob said it ""would urge every police force to pay close attention to what these stories and statistics show us -  that women are being silenced and abused by people in positions of trust and power."" Dame Vera Baird QC said she was ""not surprised that these issues don't appear to be taken as seriously as they should be by the police"". Dame Vera Baird said some officers were ""quite resistant to hearing about wrongdoing in colleagues"" There was a ""defensive, mutually supportive culture"" among police officers, she said, which can make ""forces and probably some individual officers quite resistant to hearing about wrongdoing in colleagues."" In Northumbria, where she serves as police and crime commissioner, she said she would look into creating a system where any criminal investigations against police staff would be handed over to a neighbouring force to carry out. The Home Office said it was ""essential that every allegation of domestic abuse is taken seriously. ""Where allegations are made against those working for the police, their status and powers mean it is even more important that these are thoroughly investigated to maintain public confidence."" It added: ""Where officers commit a serious breach of the standards expected of them, disciplinary and, if required, criminal proceedings should follow. ""We are also implementing a wide-ranging programme of reforms to improve police integrity, including improving the transparency of the disciplinary system and strengthening the powers of the IOPC.""

Man pours acid on himself in court,"An investigation has begun after a defendant doused himself with acid as he was being sentenced in court. Marc Marshall, 54, was in the dock of Inner London Crown Court after being jailed for fraud when he poured a noxious substance onto his face. He is in a critical condition in hospital and a female custody officer who was guarding him in the dock was also treated. The Courts Service said it was ""deeply concerned"" about Monday's incident. The case is likely to raise searching questions about security in court buildings and how the liquid, which has not yet been identified, was apparently taken into the dock. Marshall had been carrying a metal water bottle - although CCTV footage is believed to have shown that he had sipped from it as he passed through security. The incident occurred at the south London court after Marshall had pleaded guilty to a series of cheque fraud offences involving Â£135,000. Acid attack court security crackdown Hundreds of acid attack kits for police When the judge imposed a sentence of two years and four months imprisonment, Marshall was heard to wail and scream. According to one person who was present at the time, the defendant's face went white and there was a smell of acid. ""It looked like he had glue on his skin,"" the witness said. Court officials ferried water jugs to the dock to dilute the substance on Marshall's face. It is thought he had also drunk some of the liquid. He was treated at the scene by a paramedic - who is said to have described his injuries as ""life-threatening"" - and taken by ambulance to St Thomas' Hospital. The case had already been delayed because Marshall, who has changed his name a number of times, suffered serious medical problems after stabbing himself in the neck when he was arrested by police in 2016. A HM Courts and Tribunals Service spokesperson said: ""The safety and security of all court users is our priority and we're deeply concerned about the incident. ""Police are urgently investigating what happened and it would be inappropriate to comment further at this stage."" The Metropolitan Police said they were called to Court 10, Inner London Crown Court at 12:01 BST on Monday after reports of a serious assault. ""Officers, London Ambulance Service and London Air Ambulance attended and found a male aged in his fifties was found to have doused himself with a noxious substance. ""He has been taken to hospital for treatment of his injuries. His condition is critical. ""A female dock officer was also injured by some of the substance.

MPs call for Windrush equality inquiry,"The Empire Windrush arrived at Tilbury Docks, Essex, on 22 June 1948 MPs have reported the Home Office to the equalities watchdog over the Windrush scandal, accusing it of unlawful discrimination. The group of 87 says the Home Office discriminated as a ""direct result"" of so-called hostile environment policies. The letter to the Equalities and Human Rights Commission claims the government broke, and is breaking, equalities law. The Home Office said it was ""committed to righting the wrongs experienced by the Windrush generation"". 'No cap' on compensation claims Formal apology to Windrush members Has the 'hostile environment' worked? The Windrush scandal involved the wrongful detentions and deportations of some members of the Windrush generation - the thousands of people who travelled to the UK from the Caribbean in the years after World War Two. In the letter, David Lammy - chair of the all party parliamentary group on race - says the Home Office is acting in breach of equalities legislation by ""routinely"" discriminating on the basis of Britons' race. It adds: ""Clearly, the Windrush scandal represents one of the gravest breaches of equality law and the rights of British citizens in recent memory."" This video can not be played Windrush scandal: One year on An estimated 500,000 people now living in the UK, who arrived between 1948 and 1971 from Caribbean countries, have been called the Windrush generation, in reference to a ship which brought workers to the UK in 1948. They were granted indefinite leave to remain in 1971 but thousands were children travelling on their parents' passports, without their own documents. Changes to immigration law in 2012 meant those without documents were asked for evidence to continue working, access services or even to remain in the UK. Some were held in detention or removed, despite living in the country for decades. A review by a Home Office taskforce of 11,800 Caribbean cases identified164 who were deported or detainedwho might have been resident in the UK before 1973. The taskforce has traced 137 of those people, of whom 19 are known to have died. At least 18 would receive a formal apology,the government said last year.This month, the government said there was ""no cap"" onpossible compensation for those affected. Many of the new arrivals were children In the letter, the MPs call on the commission to look into how the Home Office contributed to the government's ""hostile environment"" policy and its impact on the Windrush generation. They also argue the Home Office breached the public sector equality duty, which means public bodies have to have ""due regard"" to eliminate discrimination and advance equality. The signatories are from six different parties, with most from Labour and none from the Conservatives. They include shadow home secretary Diane Abbott, Green Party MP Caroline Lucas, Luciana Berger from The Independent Group, the SNP's Alison Thewliss and Liberal Democrat Alistair Carmichael. This video can not be played Glenda Caesar wants compensation for loss of earnings, stress, and lost pension Mr Lammy said: ""The gross mishandling and abuse of the Windrush generation by the Home Office raises serious questions over whether British citizens were discriminated against on the basis of their race and ethnicity, in breach of equalities legislation. ""More than a year after I first raised this in Parliament, nothing has changed. Justice must mean not only due compensation and reparation, but changes to the institution and immigration laws that created this crisis."" The ""hostile environment"" approach to curbing illegal immigration has been blamed for members of the Windrush generation, who were in the UK legally, being wrongly threatened with deportation. The letter said the policy was ""deeply discriminatory"", arguing that black Britons are being discriminated against, while white Britons are not. A Home Office spokeswoman said: ""The home secretary and the immigration minister are committed to righting the wrongs experienced by the Windrush generation and the recently launched compensation scheme is a crucial step in delivering on that commitment. ""The Windrush generation have given so much to this country and we will ensure nothing like this ever happens again, that is why the home secretary commissioned a lessons learned review with independent oversight by Wendy Williams.""

Naruhito becomes Japan's new emperor,"Emperor Naruhito stood alongside his wife, Empress Masako, as he spoke at the Imperial Palace Japan's Emperor Naruhito has pledged to fulfil his role as a ""symbol of the state and unity"", in his first public address since taking the throne. The 59-year-old was speaking as he officially began his reign on Wednesday in a short but symbolic ceremony at the Imperial Palace. Naruhito succeeds his father, 85-year-old Akihito, who abdicated citing his age and failing health. He is the first Japanese emperor to stand down in more than 200 years. Your questions answered on Japan's emperors Naruhito: Taking Japan into a new era Masako: The princess who struggles with royal life Akihito, who will now be known as Emperor Emeritus, had endeared himself to many Japanese people during his reign through his interactions with those suffering from disease and disaster. In his speech, Emperor Naruhito paid tribute to his father while pledging to show the same devotion to his people. ""[Akihito] showed profound compassion through his own bearing,"" he said. ""I swear that I will reflect deeply on the course followed by the Emperor Emeritus ... and fulfil my responsibility as the symbol of the state and of the unity of the people of Japan."" Naruhito technically became emperor at the stroke of midnight when his father's reign came to an end - marking the start of the new Reiwa era. But on Wednesday morning his place was formalised as he symbolically took possession of the sacred imperial regalia - a sword and a gem - that have been passed down through the generations. Emperor Naruhito has inherited the imperial regalia Japanese emperors do not wear a crown so these treasures, along with a mirror, act as a symbol of imperial power. Japan's powerful unseen Imperial Treasures However the items used in the ceremony are duplicates - the real objects are kept in shrines around the country and never seen. This video can not be played The moment Japan's new emperor inherits the Imperial Treasures Emperor Naruhito and his wife Masako Owada, a former diplomat, are expected to be more modern in their outlook. The Oxford-educated royal said in a news conference in 2017 that he believed ""that just as new winds blow in every age, the role of the imperial family changes in each age"". ""I would like to learn various things from the past while also pursuing the ideal role that the Imperial Family should take in the future,"" he said.,external However, he is expected to carry on his father's legacy - working to replicate the sense of closeness to the public that Emperor Akihito had built up. Naruhito and Masako in their Japanese Imperial wedding costumes in 1993 The Emperor and Empress reportedly met at a tea party and married in 1993. Empress Masako was educated at Harvard and Oxford, and had a promising career as a diplomat before her marriage. Masako later told reporters that she had accepted Naruhito's proposal after he said: ""You might have fears and worries about joining the imperial household. But I will protect you for my entire life."" They have one child, Princess Aiko, who was born in 2001. But Japanese law prohibits women from inheriting the throne. Empress Masako has struggled to cope with royal life and the pressure to produce a male heir. She reportedly suffers from a stress disorder, and admitted last year that she was ""insecure"" about becoming empress. However, she has pledged to do her best to serve the people of Japan. This video can not be played Princess Aiko, the only child of Japan's Crown Prince Naruhito, will not ascend the throne because she is female (Archive video) Naruhito's brother Prince Fumihito will be next in line to the throne, followed by the new emperor's nephew, 12-year-old Prince Hisahito. It's the oldest continuing hereditary monarchy in the world. Legends date it back to about 600 BC. In fact, Japanese emperors used to be seen as gods, but Emperor Hirohito - Naruhito's grandfather - publicly renounced his divinity at the end of World War Two, as part of Japan's surrender. Today, the role is largely ceremonial and the emperor is barred from making any political statements. Emperor Emeritus Akihito went through the abdication ceremonies a day earlier Emperor Akihito is seen as having redefined the role, helping to repair the damage to Japan's reputation after the war. Previous emperors rarely interacted with the public, but Akihito broke down the barrier between the royals and the people - and came to be known for his compassion. Akihito: The emperor with the human touch He also took up the role of a diplomat, becoming an unofficial ambassador for Japan and travelling abroad extensively - Naruhito is expected to continue this. Akihito will now be known as ""Joko"", which means ""grand emperor"", and by the English title ""Emperor Emeritus"", while his wife Michiko will be ""Empress Emerita"".

Man pours acid on himself in courtDefendant is in a critical condition in hospital after incident during fraud case sentencing.UK,"An investigation has begun after a defendant doused himself with acid as he was being sentenced in court. Marc Marshall, 54, was in the dock of Inner London Crown Court after being jailed for fraud when he poured a noxious substance onto his face. He is in a critical condition in hospital and a female custody officer who was guarding him in the dock was also treated. The Courts Service said it was ""deeply concerned"" about Monday's incident. The case is likely to raise searching questions about security in court buildings and how the liquid, which has not yet been identified, was apparently taken into the dock. Marshall had been carrying a metal water bottle - although CCTV footage is believed to have shown that he had sipped from it as he passed through security. The incident occurred at the south London court after Marshall had pleaded guilty to a series of cheque fraud offences involving Â£135,000. Acid attack court security crackdown Hundreds of acid attack kits for police When the judge imposed a sentence of two years and four months imprisonment, Marshall was heard to wail and scream. According to one person who was present at the time, the defendant's face went white and there was a smell of acid. ""It looked like he had glue on his skin,"" the witness said. Court officials ferried water jugs to the dock to dilute the substance on Marshall's face. It is thought he had also drunk some of the liquid. He was treated at the scene by a paramedic - who is said to have described his injuries as ""life-threatening"" - and taken by ambulance to St Thomas' Hospital. The case had already been delayed because Marshall, who has changed his name a number of times, suffered serious medical problems after stabbing himself in the neck when he was arrested by police in 2016. A HM Courts and Tribunals Service spokesperson said: ""The safety and security of all court users is our priority and we're deeply concerned about the incident. ""Police are urgently investigating what happened and it would be inappropriate to comment further at this stage."" The Metropolitan Police said they were called to Court 10, Inner London Crown Court at 12:01 BST on Monday after reports of a serious assault. ""Officers, London Ambulance Service and London Air Ambulance attended and found a male aged in his fifties was found to have doused himself with a noxious substance. ""He has been taken to hospital for treatment of his injuries. His condition is critical. ""A female dock officer was also injured by some of the substance. Her injuries are not believed to be serious and she did not require hospital treatment."" Acid attack court security crackdown Hundreds of acid attack kits for police.

Ex-Worcestershire player Alex Hepburn assaulted the victim at his Worcester flat after she had consensual sex with his then teammate Joe Clarke in 2017. The 23-year-old was found guilty of rape earlier this month and sentenced to five years at Hereford Crown Court. Judge Jim Tindal told him the sexual conquest ""game"" he had set up on a WhatsApp group was ""laddish"" behaviour that ""demeaned women"".

"Apple iPhone sales drop at record paceSmartphone revenue falls at its steepest-ever rate, but the technology giant is upbeat on the future.Business","Sales of Apple's iPhones fell at their steepest-ever rate, according to data for the three months to the end of March. The firm said revenue from the iPhone dropped by 17%, compared with the same period a year earlier, to $31bn. However, Apple chief executive Tim Cook said sales were stronger towards the end of March, including in China where it cut iPhone prices to boost demand. Apple lifted its outlook for the three months to June. That sent shares more than 5% higher in after-hours trading. The companyhad warned of slowing iPhone sales earlier this year, especially in China, where Apple competes with cheaper rivals such as Huawei Technologies and Xiaomi. Apple unveils TV streaming platform When will you next buy a phone? But Mr Cook said price adjustments in China, lower Chinese taxes on the iPhone and new trade-in and financing deals helped sales start to recover toward the end of the quarter. He also credited improving demand for products such as the Apple Watch, along with progress in US-China trade talks. Apple chief executive Tim Cook and Oprah Winfrey at the launch of Apple TV+ in March ""The trade relationship, versus the previous quarter, is better. The tone is better,"" Mr Cook told Reuters. ""The sum of all of this together, it helped us."" Apple has lifted its guidance for its third quarter revenue to between $52.5bn and $54.5bn. For the three months to March, total sales hit $58bn compared to analysts' estimates of $57.3bn. However, that is below total sales of $61.1bn in the second quarter last year. And while demand improved in China, sales in the region were still down by 20%. Profits for the second quarter fell to $11.5bn compared to $13.8bn in the same period a year ago. Apple is attempting to shift its reliance on the iPhone towards services and last month unveiled its new TV streaming platform, Apple TV+, to take on the likes of more established companies such as Netflix. Services revenue rose to $11.4bn from $9.8bn in the same quarter last year. But Yoram Wurmser, principal analyst at eMarketer, said long-term growth in services and, to a less extent, other devices ""depend on having as many users as possible in the Apple ecosystem, and that's still primarily about the iPhone"". ""The long-term growth of the company still depends directly and indirectly on iPhone sales,"" he added.

Maternity services in special measures,"The review looked into services at hospitals in the south Wales valleys A health board's maternity services are ""under extreme pressure"" and ""dysfunctional"", according to a damning independent review. The health minister has put services into special measures after failings were uncovered at the Royal Glamorgan and Prince Charles hospitals in the south Wales valleys. It was prompted by concerns about the deaths of a number of babies. The review heard women had""distressing experiences and poor care"". It was prompted by 25 serious incidents, including eight stillbirths and five neonatal deaths, between January 2016 and last September. Health Minister Vaughan Gething orderedthe separate independent review into the Cwm Taf health board services,external, which was published on Tuesday. It found that the suspicions and concerns raised by women were not taken seriously, while there was ""little evidence of effective clinical leadership at any level"". This video can not be played Jessica Western says she is still fighting to find out why her daughter Macie died ""Many women had felt something was wrong with their baby or tried to convey the level of pain they were experiencing but they were ignored or patronised, and no action was taken, with tragic outcomes including stillbirth and neonatal death of their babies,"" the report said. One woman said she felt worthless, adding: ""I'm broken from the whole experience, the lack of care and compassion."" Q&A: Cwm Taf maternity problems Mothers ignored and made to feel worthless Gething rejects quit call over Cwm Taf 'My baby is buried 4,000 miles away' The review also suggested that further cases should be looked at - going back to 2010 - to ""determine the extent of the under-reporting"" of issues and to provide assurance to the health board. Dr Frank Atherton, Wales' chief medical officer, said there had been a ""systemic failure to report incidents"", adding: ""The level of patient care has fallen far short of what we would expect."" The review, led by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecology, and the Royal College of Midwives, found 11 areas of immediate concern at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital in Llantrisant and Prince Charles in Merthyr Tydfil, including: Often no consultant obstetrician on the labour ward, and difficult to contact Not enough midwives, putting them under ""extreme pressure"" Consultants were not always available out of hours - and would take 45 minutes to get in ""Fragmented"" consultant cover while their roster arrangements were ""complex and inflexible"" High numbers of locum staff at all levels Staff not aware of guidelines, protocols, triggers and escalations ""Punitive culture"" within the service and staff felt senior management did not listen to their concerns, which they had ""voiced repeatedly over a long period of time"" The review said it was ""dismayed"" that an internal report, written by a consultant midwife, highlighting many safety concerns last September was not acted upon, ""thereby continuing to expose women to unacceptable risks"". There was an under-reporting of serious incidents for at least four years but senior midwives said there was a reluctance to engage with the process because of a ""fear of blame"". There had also been 67 stillbirths going back to 2010 which had not been reported for inclusion in statistics for a national database. Cwm Taf's chief executive Allison Williams offered a public apology saying she was ""deeply sorry for the failings"" identified. She said the health board fully accepted the findings and putting things right was now the organisation's utmost priority. ""Some of the feedback we have received from patients is extremely distressing,"" she added. ""I would also like to say sorry to our staff who have felt that their concerns have not been listened to."" Prince Charles Hospital now has an expanded special care baby unit and six en-suite delivery rooms Mr Gething apologised to the women and families affected buthas rejected calls to resignand said the failings was not ""a simple one person, one group is responsible"". He called the findings ""serious and concerning"" and said they would be ""difficult and upsetting to read for both families and staff working within the service"". ""I am determined that the actions I am announcing today will drive the changes necessary in Cwm Taf,"" he added. ""It is vitally important that this work provides reassurance for families currently receiving care in their hospitals."" Cwm Taf told to 'get back on track' 26 baby deaths in maternity probe Maternity staff 'overwhelmed' by demand The minister has put the maternity services into special measures - the Welsh Government's highest level of intervention. Cwm Taf as a whole has also had its status escalated from enhanced monitoring to targeted intervention. An independent panel will now oversee those services to drive improvements at the hospitals - which handle 3,700 births each year. It will be led by the former chairman of the Welsh Ambulance Service and ex-Gwent chief constable Mick Giannasi. It will look into 43 cases and Dr Atherton said within that group ""there will have been avoidable harm"". The review suggested further cases dating back to 2010 should now be looked at We heard rumours before publication that this report would be ""bad"" but few perhaps expected it to be as damning and damaging. Each page highlights one failing after another. Certainly it's one of the most critical reports ever published about healthcare in Wales It talks of a dysfunctional service, badly led, with mistakes not being reported due to a fear of blame. And consultants were not able to respond to life-threatening cases out-of-hours for 45 minutes. Some behaviour was also unacceptable, with midwives discussing colleagues on a Whatsapp group, as being either ""naughty"" or ""nice"". All of this, at a health board up until recently considered one of the best performing in Wales. There will be questions from the health board but also questions about the Welsh Government's oversight. Senior officials saying we can only act on what we're told will ring hollow with families. The review casts a doubt on the credibility of the health board's own ongoing investigation into 43 cases. They want to take it over and will take a look at cases back to 2010. Yes, the health board's maternity services are now in special measures but families will ask whether any individuals will be held to account. In January theinvestigators demanded immediate action- including more cover by senior doctors on the labour wards. Cwm Taf health board had already been planning changes and since March, specialist neonatal care is now only provided on one site - Prince Charles Hospital. The Royal Glamorgan still has a midwife-led unit for less complicated births. The health board was renamed Cwm Taf Morgannwg at the start of April, when it also became responsible for services in the Bridgend area.

Concern over police domestic abuse cases,"This video can not be played 'Suzanne' says she believes her ex-husband was ""protected because of his job"" Police officers and staff accused of domestic abuse are a third less likely to be convicted than the general public, figures from 37 forces suggest. They show 3.9% of claims against police led to a conviction from 2015-18 in England and Wales, compared with 6.2% among the population as a whole. Police domestic abuse lead Dame Vera Baird said the issue does not ""appear to be taken as seriously"" as it should. The Home Office said it was bringing in reforms ""to improve police integrity"". Figures from the Freedom of Information request,conducted by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism (TBIJ),,externalalso found that more than four allegations of domestic abuse against police staff were recorded each week. Fewer than a quarter of those allegations led to disciplinary action. There are 200,000 members of the police workforce in England and Walesaccording to latest figures,external, of whom 122,000 are police officers. Suzanne - not her real name - told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme her ex-husband, a police officer, was violent towards her for years.

Lives have been ruined - contaminated blood victims,"This video can not be played Derek Martindale's brother was also infected with HIV: ""He knew he was dying... I wasn't there for him"" Victims of the contaminated blood scandal have been telling a public inquiry how their lives have been ruined. The hearing is looking at how thousands of people were infected with hepatitis C and HIV from contaminated blood they were given in the 1970s and 80s. One man said he was devastated when he was told he had only a year to live after being diagnosed with HIV. Another said he was so sick that plans started to be made for his funeral. Inquiry chairman Sir Brian Langstaff praised the bravery of those giving evidence. He warned that the accounts being put forward were ""harrowing"", ""moving"" and ""chilling"". He said there would be ""more to come"" during the two-year inquiry, but pledged to make sure the victims got a chance to tell their stories. This video can not be played Martin Beard was told he was HIV positive at the age of 17 The scandal has been called the worst treatment disaster in the history of the NHS. About 5,000 people with haemophilia, a genetic condition that prevents blood from clotting properly, were infected when they were given blood products to help their blood clot. More than 2,000 are already thought to have died. Thousands more may have been exposed through blood transfusions after an operation or childbirth. Blood inquiry seeks answers at last 'NHS scandal killed both my husbands' The secret in my blood Hundreds of victims and their families are expected to give evidence during the inquiry. One of the first people to take the stand was Derek Martindale, who has haemophilia. He said he was 23 when he was diagnosed with HIV in 1985 and was given a year to live. Mr Martindale said he had been told not to tell anyone, even his family. He added: ""When you're young you're invincible, when you're 23 you're generally fit, but then you're told you have 12 months to live - it's very hard to comprehend, so there was the fear. ""There was no future, the likelihood of getting married and having children was very unlikely."" Mr Martindale said his brother Richard, who also had haemophilia, was diagnosed with HIV too. He said his greatest regret was not being able to support his brother in the months before he died in 1990. Another victim who gave evidence was Perry Evans, 57, from Winchester. He was diagnosed with mild haemophilia as a child and regularly received blood products. He was told he had HIV in 1985 and has suffered with health problems including hepatitis C, chest infections, pneumonia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. At one point he was so ill in hospital that plans started to be made for his funeral. ""I cried when I came out because I didn't think I would come out,"" he said. Carole Anne Hill found out in January 2017 that she had hepatitis C, infected as a result of a blood transfusion she was given in 1987. She had menorrhagia at that time, suffering from heavy periods. Asked how she heard about her diagnosis, she told the inquiry: ""By letter, which was half opened and not sealed properly."" ""I was cross about that,"" she added. Su Gorman's husband, Steve Dymond, died in December A number of people have also been speaking out ahead of the start of the hearing. Su Gorman said the main thing victims and their families wanted from the inquiry was ""justice"" and people held to account. Her husband, Steve Dymond, died aged 62 on 23 December last year of organ failure - ultimately caused by the medicine he was given as a young man. Su said: ""I want to see justice. ""Steve's dying words were he wanted them to repent. I promised him they would - and that's a promise I intend to keep."" About 5,000 people with haemophilia and other bleeding disorders are believed to have been infected with HIV and hepatitis viruses over a period of more than 20 years. This was because they were injected with blood products used to help their blood clot. It was a treatment introduced in the early 1970s. Before then, patients faced lengthy stays in hospital to have transfusions, even for minor injuries. Britain was struggling to keep up with demand for the treatment - known as clotting agent Factor VIII - and so supplies were imported from the US. But much of the human blood plasma used to make the product came from donors such as prison inmates, who sold their blood. Factor VIII was imported from the US in the 1970s and 1980s The blood products were made by pooling plasma from up to 40,000 donors and concentrating it. People who had blood transfusions after an operation or childbirth were also exposed to the contaminated blood - as many as 30,000 people may have been infected. By the mid-1980s, the products started to be heat-treated to kill the viruses. But questions remain about how much was known before this and why some contaminated products remained in circulation. Screening of blood products began in 1991. And by the late 1990s, synthetic treatments for haemophilia became available, removing the infection risk. This is the first UK-wide public inquiry that can compel witnesses to testify. It comes after decades of campaigning by victims, who claim the risks were never explained and the scandal was subsequently covered up. The government has been strongly criticised for dragging its heels. There have been previous inquiries. One was led by Labour peer Lord Archer of Sandwell and was privately funded. It held no official status and was unable to compel witnesses to testify or require the disclosure of documents. Meanwhile, the Penrose Inquiry, a seven-year investigation launched by the government in Scotland, was criticised as a whitewash when it was published in 2015. Greater Manchester Mayor and former health secretary Andy Burnham has repeatedly called for a probe into what happened. Mr Burnham claimed in the House of Commons in 2017 that a ""criminal cover-up on an industrial scale"" had taken place. The government announced there would be an inquiry only after it faced a possible defeat in a vote on an emergency motion. This public inquiry into the scandal was first announced in the summer of 2017. Ahead of the public hearings, the government announced more financial support for people in England affected by the tragedy, to a total of Â£75m from Â£46m, amid complaints other parts of the UK were more generous. Prime Minister Theresa May said: ""The contaminated blood scandal was a tragedy that should never have happened and has caused unimaginable pain and hurt for victims and their families for decades. ""I know this will be a difficult time for victims and their families - but today will begin a journey which will be dedicated to getting to the truth of what happened and in delivering justice to everyone involved."" But Jason Evans, founder of the campaign group Factor VIII, said the fund was still essentially a ""begging bowl"" and the increase, about Â£900 for each victim, represented ""virtually no change"".

"What to look out for in the local electionsMore than 8,000 seats are up for grabs in polls across England - but what impact will Brexit have?UK Politics","On Thursday 2 May, voters will head to the polls across England for local elections. The elections will decide who runs local authorities across the country and could be an important test of public and political opinion for Theresa May, Jeremy Corbyn and the other party leaders. There are 343 councils in England. They provide a wide range of services, depending on their shape and size. These include housing, road maintenance, parking, rubbish collection, leisure and cultural facilities, school funding and admissions, environmental health, planning and social services. The largest local authorities are also responsible for adult social care and children's services. Councillors are elected to sit on these councils and represent people in a specific geographical area for a fixed term of four years. They decide on the overall direction of policy, which is implemented on a day-to-day basis by non-elected council officials. This video can not be played Local elections: What are they all about? Elections take place in four-year cycles, with different councils holding elections in different years. This time around, elections are taking place in 248 councils, with 8,425 seats up for grabs and about 25,000 people standing.   By-elections can take place in some council wards even if that council is not scheduled for elections this year. Check your council website for details. The vast majority of England's smaller district councils are holding elections. Nearly 120 of these are electing a full slate of councillors while a smaller number are choosing only a third. There are 30 of England's larger unitary authorities, such as Bedford, Stoke-on-Trent, Redcar and Cleveland and York, which are electing all their councillors while a smaller number are choosing a third. In addition, the majority of England's 36 metropolitan borough councils - including cities such as Manchester, Liverpool and Newcastle Upon Tyne - are electing a third of their representatives. There are no polls in Birmingham this year while the only elections in London are by-elections for two wards in Lewisham and Havering borough councils. Voters will not be heading to the polls in Cornwall while there are no elections in any of England's 26 ""shire"" county councils. However, many of England's 8,000 parish and community councils will elect representatives to make decisions on planning applications, amenities and other issues on behalf of their local villages and towns. According to the Electoral Reform Society, there are about 150 council wards where there is only one candidate who will be elected unopposed. Voters will also be going to the polls in Northern Ireland to elect 462 councillors across 11 council areas. There are no local elections this year in Wales or Scotland. 30 unitary authorities will be contested in their entirety - including Bedford, Brighton, Stoke, Redcar and York If you are registered to vote, you will be able to take part in Thursday's elections. If there is an election in your area, you should have already received a polling card, giving details of your nearest polling station. You should take this with you when you go to vote, although in most places you will be able to vote without it. Polling stations open at 07.00 BST and close at 22.00 BST. The deadline for registering has passed so if you are not on the electoral register, you will not be able to vote. To find out whether you are registered, contact your local Electoral Registration Office viathe gov.uk website.,external If you live in certain parts of the country, you will need to take ID with you when you vote - as part of an ongoing government trial to tackle voter fraud. InBroxtowe,external,Craven,external,Derby,external,North Kesteven,externalandBraintree,external, voters will have to show either one piece of photo ID or two forms of non-photo ID. InMid Sussex,external,Watford,externalandNorth West Leicestershire,external, people will have to bring their polling cards or photo ID. Voters inPendle,externalandWoking,externalwill only be able to show photo ID at the polling station to be given a ballot paper. Parties are said to run, or have control, of a council if they have more seats than all their opponents combined. If no party has a majority, a council is said to be under no overall control. Those parties with the most seats are referred to as being the largest party and can strike deals with others, such as independents, to run the local authority. According to the Local Government Information Unit,citing House of Commons library figures,external, 56% of councils are currently under Tory control, Labour run 28% while the Lib Dems control 3%. The remaining 12% are under no overall control. This video can not be played Council elections: Why don't two-thirds of people vote? In most cases, these seats were last contested in 2015, on the same day as that year's general election, in which the Conservatives won a majority in Parliament. A lot has changed since then, of course. The Conservatives are defending the largest number of seats, with 4,906 Tory councillors up for re-election, compared with 2,113 for Labour. The Liberal Democrats have 647 seats to defend, UKIP 176 and the Green Party 71. There are also 512 seats held by independents being fought. There will be a battle royal in Brighton where, after a series of Labour defections and by-elections, the Conservatives are now the largest party. The Green Party - which used to run the council between 2011 and 2015 - is also looking to boost its presence. In Cheshire West and Chester the council is on a knife-edge with both Labour and the Conservatives fighting to be the largest party. Milton Keynes, Bolton, Calderdale and Blackpool may also switch hands, or the ruling party could lose its majority and surrender overall control. The Conservatives did relatively well in 2015 and the pressure will be on Theresa May this time Many voters will be motivated by purely local issues. But Brexit remains the dominant political subject and the polls will be a big test for Theresa May, who is under growing pressure from her MPs and activists angered by delays to the UK's departure from the EU. Labour's performance, as ever, will be closely watched to see if it is making progress in those areas needed to win a general election. The Lib Dems and Green Party will be hoping to do well on the back of their anti-Brexit, anti-austerity messages. UKIP is fielding about 1,400 candidates but the newly launched Brexit Party is focusing its attention on the European elections while new centrist party Change UK did not register in time to put up candidates. The race to be the first area to declare its result is not quite as intense as on general election night. But expect the first results to come in between midnight and 01.00 am on Friday, with St Helens, Sunderland, Swindon and North Tyneside among those vying to be the quickest. The busiest time is set to be between 02.00 and 04.00 BST, when results will start flooding in from across England, including Oldham, Plymouth, Portsmouth, Stockport, Liverpool and Trafford. However, some local authorities won't begin counting their votes until 09.00 am on Friday. Manchester is expected to declare at 15.00 BST, Brighton and York at 17.00 BST and Cheshire West and Chester at 19.00 BST. Yes, there are six mayoral contests taking place, in Bedford, Copeland, Leicester, Mansfield, Middlesbrough and a Metro Mayor for North of Tyne.

Concern over police domestic abuse casesPolice staff accused of domestic abuse are less likely than the general population to be convicted.UK,"This video can not be played 'Suzanne' says she believes her ex-husband was ""protected because of his job"" Police officers and staff accused of domestic abuse are a third less likely to be convicted than the general public, figures from 37 forces suggest. They show 3.9% of claims against police led to a conviction from 2015-18 in England and Wales, compared with 6.2% among the population as a whole. Police domestic abuse lead Dame Vera Baird said the issue does not ""appear to be taken as seriously"" as it should. The Home Office said it was bringing in reforms ""to improve police integrity"". Figures from the Freedom of Information request,conducted by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism (TBIJ),,externalalso found that more than four allegations of domestic abuse against police staff were recorded each week. Fewer than a quarter of those allegations led to disciplinary action. There are 200,000 members of the police workforce in England and Walesaccording to latest figures,external, of whom 122,000 are police officers. Suzanne - not her real name - told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme her ex-husband, a police officer, was violent towards her for years. She said she eventually called police when he threatened her with a knife, but they did very little. ""The police turned up and the only advice they gave him was he should leave the house and go for a walk to calm down. ""I don't remember them talking to me at all,"" she added.

Blood inquiry seeks answers,"Derek Martindale was given a year to live It has been a long time coming - more than three decades to be precise. At long last a full public inquiry into the infected blood scandal has started a process which will attempt to give victims and their families some answers. Preliminary hearings last September set out the wide-ranging scope of the inquiry. Now witnesses, including those infected and affected, have begun giving evidence. In other countries where haemophiliacs and others became infected with HIV and hepatitis C through treatment by their health systems, politicians have been held to account and full compensation has been paid. The UK has not moved in the same way to try to establish who was responsible and why the biggest treatment disaster in the history of the NHS was allowed to unfold. Blood inquiry evidence 'harrowing and chilling' 'NHS scandal killed both my husbands' The secret in my blood A clotting agent, Factor VIII, was made from donated blood, some of which was infected and had come from paid foreign donors including prisoners. The big question is who at high levels of the NHS and government knew what and when. Here in the UK there has been one privately funded inquiry with no powers to compel witnesses to attend. In Scotland a judge-led inquiry under Lord Penrose reached limited conclusions. Now, under Sir Brian Langstaff, the new statutory UK-wide inquiry is under way which in his own words will be ""independent of government, and frightened of no-one in the conclusions it may draw"". He is well aware of allegations of a cover-up in Whitehall with documents destroyed. The opening day of evidence has served as a reminder of what was inflicted on patients who went to the NHS for treatment in good faith. Derek Martindale, comforted by his son John sitting beside him, described being treated with blood products for his haemophilia in the mid-1980s but with no warning about the risks of contracting HIV and hepatitis C. He asked for an HIV test and was told he was positive but was instructed not to tell anyone including his family and parents. His brother, also a haemophiliac, later died with Aids and he spoke of the devastating impact on his parents. At the end of Mr Martindale's evidence, people in the room stood and clapped. Dr Hill didn't find out for 20 years that she had hepatitis C Dr Carole Hill had a blood transfusion in 1987 but it wasn't until 2017 that she was told she had hepatitis C. It transpired clinicians had carried out a test a few months earlier after she went in for another appointment. Dr Hill said she was angry at the way she had been dealt with by the NHS in recent years. She said better communication was required and more effort should be made to contact others who had blood transfusions and might have been infected with hepatitis C. Perry Evans told the inquiry of his sadness at the impact on friends and family when he revealed his health condition. He was told he was HIV positive in 1985 following treatment for his haemophilia but it transpired doctors had known several months before and not told him. He spoke movingly about living with HIV at a time of scare stories and stigma. Victims and their campaigning groups, supported by the judge, have called for more generous financial support. The Scottish government increased payouts after the Penrose inquiry but England, Wales and Northern Ireland have lagged behind. Hours before the first inquiry, it was announced at Westminster that total annual funding would be increased from Â£46m to Â£75m for recipients in England. This video can not be played Martin Beard was told he was HIV positive at the age of 17 The authorities in Wales and Northern Ireland are likely to follow but this is subject to further discussions. Coming late in the day and without much detail, the government's financial announcement did not seem to impress many of the key participants. There has been no change to unpopular means-testing and no solid demonstration that there can be parity of payments across the UK. Compensation is another matter and could involve large sums of money. Claims could hinge on the findings of this infected blood inquiry and the extent to which it finds fault at the heart of government.

Support payments 'must rise',"Victims of the NHS contaminated blood scandal have written to the health secretary asking for an immediate increase in support payments, the BBC has learned. The public inquiry into the scandal is not due to look at financial support until 2020. Campaign group Tainted Blood said, at the current rate, 112 more people would die before the issue was resolved. The Cabinet Office said it ""will consider"" calls for improved support. Labour MP Diana Johnson - co-chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Haemophilia and Contaminated Blood - told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme: ""The state has harmed these people, and the state now needs to step up and compensate them properly."" A public inquiry opened last month looking into how thousands of people in the 1970s and 80s were given blood products infected with hepatitis viruses and HIV. It is thought more than 2,400 people have died, while many others have been left in very poor health. Last week, inquiry chairman Sir Brian Langstaff wrote to the Cabinet Office describing how some families had ""lost everything"" and ""had to live on the breadline"". He asked the government to take ""decisive action"" to tackle the issue of financial compensation. The Cabinet Office has said it ""will consider"" the recommendations and ""respond as soon as possible"". Tainted Blood, the largest support group for victims, has now written to Health Secretary Matt Hancock asking the government to address what it says is an ""unacceptable delay"" in dealing with finances. In the letter, seen by the Victoria Derbyshire programme, it calls for support payments in England, Wales and Northern Ireland to be increased to the level received by Scottish victims of the scandal. ""I believe it will be a matter of deep and future shame for this government if it fails to act, and act quickly,"" said Andrew Evans, chairman of the group. As it stands there are a number of complex financial support schemes running across the UK. Payments can range from under Â£5,000 a year to more than Â£36,000. In most cases, Scottish victims of the scandal and their families receive more than victims living in Wales, with those in Northern Ireland and England receiving the least. The campaign group says someone infected with both HIV and early-stage hepatitis C in Scotland can receive a lump sum of Â£50,000 plus Â£37,000 a year in support payments. In England a victim in a similar condition would receive around Â£26,500 a year with no lump sum. The widow of someone infected in a Scottish hospital can receive an annual support payment of Â£27,250 compared with a single one-off payment of Â£10,000 in England. The group is now asking asking for parity with the Scottish system, for payments to be backdated, and all widows' payments to be paid regardless of whether the victim has remarried or formed a civil partnership. Labour MP Diana Johnson said there was ""no reason at all why our government couldn't decide now, even though the public inquiry is under way, to say, 'Right, we're going to compensate these people and pay them properly'"". She said that as an interim measure, payments in other parts of the UK should be brought up to the same level as those in Scotland, but that she ""still [doesn't] think that's enough"". She said in ""many cases"" the lives of those affected had been ""destroyed"". Around 5,000 people with haemophilia and other bleeding disorders are believed to have been infected with hepatitis viruses in the 1970s and 80s. It is thought more than 1,250 were also infected with HIV. Nearly 3,000 of them have since died. They were injected with a treatment - either Factor VIII or IV - used to help their blood clot. But Britain was struggling to keep up with demand for the treatment and so supplies were imported from the US. Much of the human blood plasma used to make the product came from donors such as prison inmates, who sold their blood. Other victims who had blood transfusions after surgery were also exposed to contaminated blood - as many as 30,000 people may have been infected. By the mid-1980s the blood products started to be heat-treated to kill the viruses. But questions remain about how much was known before this, and why some contaminated products remained in circulation. Screening of blood products began in 1991 and by the late 1990s, synthetic treatments for haemophilia became available, removing the infection risk.

Free cash machines close at record rate,"More than 250 free-to-use cash machines are disappearing a month as operators shut unprofitable ones, the network co-ordinator Link has said. There are 53,000 free machines in the UK - but the number is shrinking at a record rate as people use less cash. Now the Payment Systems Regulator (PSR) is cracking down on the closures and asking for more network protection. ""Free-to-use ATMs continue to play a vital role in helping people access their money,"" the regulator said. Hannah Nixon, the PSR's managing director, said: ""The requirements we intend to place on Link will help ensure that Link achieves their commitment to protecting the geographic spread of free-to-use ATMs across the UK."" Link's ATM Footprint Report found that between the end of January and the start of July 2018, the number of free-to-use ATMs fell from 54,500 to 53,200. That is partly because people are using cash less, Link said, thanks to the rise in popularity of new payment methods such as contactless transactions. But it is also because cash machine operators such as Cardtronics and Note Machine, who get a fee from our banks each time we use one, are finding that fewer of their machines are economic to run. Row intensifies over cash machines fee Who do we trust after cash? The High Streets with 'too many' ATMs Under pressure from banks, Link is cutting the fee it pays to operators while trying to restrict the resulting closures in city centres, Link said it had set up ""specific arrangements to protect free-to-use ATMs more than 1km away from their next nearest free-to-use ATM"". The organisation has earmarked some 2,365 free machines in remote and rural areas that it wants to remain open. But 76 of these protected cash machines closed between January and July, 21 of them without even a Post Office nearby to get cash over the counter. The PSR says it is concerned and is taking action to ensure Link meets its commitments. It is also seeking renewed commitments from banks that consumers will continue to be offered services, allowing them to access their cash. But the regulator's intervention on ATM closures may be ""too little, too late"", warned Nicky Morgan, Chair of the Treasury Committee. She said: ""The PSR is rightly concerned by the closures, but I fear its regulatory intervention may be too little, too late. It must ensure that Link is held to its commitment to maintain the broad geographic spread of free-to-use ATMs. ""The Committee has been clear that this is a major test of what is a relatively new regulator, but the banks, the ATM deployers, and Link itself also have a duty to ensure consumers don't lose out."" Jenni Allen, managing director of Which? Money, said: ""Link is failing on its commitment to protect access to cash for people in remote and rural areas who need it most. ""The PSR must now urgently intervene to stop further closures and ensure that no more consumers are suddenly stripped of their access to cash."" Radio 1 Newsbeat reporter Gurvinder Gill There are plenty of cash machines in King's Lynn town centre, you'll find most major banks here on the High Street. But some of the surrounding villages have been listed as the worst places in the country when it comes to accessing cash. Lauren, who lives in Narborough in Norfolk, told me she has to travel 10 minutes in her car to get to her closest ATM. She says she always has to be organised and often gets cash back at supermarkets. Lily lives in King's Lynn and told me her closest cash machine is at a Tesco Express which is 15 minutes away. She says she avoids using cash when she can, but does need it for nights out and getting a taxi home.

British Steel lent ÃÂ£100m for carbon bill,"British Steel's Scunthorpe plant British Steel has secured a Â£100m loan from the government to pay its EU carbon bill, a source close to the company has said. The money means the private equity-owned firm will avoid a steep EU fine. The firm said earlier this month it needed the funds to settle its 2018 pollution bill due at the end of April. Sky News,externalsaid the government money was used to pay for the company's carbon credits - and that British Steel would repay the money on commercial terms. The firm has been hit by a European Union decision to suspend UK firms' access to free carbon permitsuntil a Brexit withdrawal deal is ratified. The EU'semissions trading system,external's rules allow industrial polluters to use carbon credits to pay for the previous year's emissions, or trade them to raise money. Each free permit gives a firm the right to emit a ton (1,000kg) of carbon dioxide (CO2). The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (Beis) declined to comment on British Steel specifically, but said it was in ""regular conversation with a wide range of companies"". Beis is expected to make a formal announcement on Wednesday. British Steel has previously said ministers and officials from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy had ""been responsive and supportive"". Private equity firm Greybull Capital rescued Tata Steel's long products business - which makes steel for the rail and construction sectors - during the depths of the steel crisis in 2016, saving more than 4,000 jobs. It paid a nominal Â£1 fee for the assets, but pledged to plough up to Â£400m into the business which it rebranded British Steel. Workers had to take pay cuts and reductions in their pensions in return, but the company has since returned to profit. The company employs 4,000 people at its Scunthorpe plant and has sites in Teesside, Cumbria and North Yorkshire.
