My son died in 1994 but his heart only stopped beating this year,"On the night of 29 September 1994, seven-year-old Nicholas Green was fatally shot during a family holiday in southern Italy. The death was a tragedy for his parents, Reg and Maggie, but their decision to donate his organs caused organ donation rates in Italy to triple in a decade - a result dubbed the ""Nicholas effect"". ""The first time I sensed danger was when a dark car came up close behind us and stayed there for a few moments,"" says Reg Green, who is remembering the night his son was inexplicably shot by strangers in southern Italy. ""Shortly after, this car began to overtake. I relaxed, thinking there was nothing wrong after all."" But, instead of overtaking, the car drew alongside. Reg and Maggie heard loud angry cries. They assumed that the men inside wanted them to stop. ""I thought if we did stop we would be completely at their mercy. So instead I accelerated. They did too, so the two cars raced alongside each other through the night. A bullet shattered the back window. Maggie turned around and both the children appeared to be fast asleep."" Reg Green in the Alps with Eleanor and Nicholas In fact, Nicholas had been shot in the head although his sister Eleanor was sleeping peacefully. Seconds later, the driver's window was blown in too and the other car drove off. ""I stopped the car and got out. The interior light came on but Nicholas didn't move. I looked closer and saw his tongue was sticking out slightly and there was a trace of vomit on his chin,"" says Green, 88, whose book about the experience, The Nicholas Effect, formed the basis for the 1998 film starring Jamie Lee Curtis and Alan Bates, Nicholas' Gift. ""For the first time we realised something terrible had happened. The shock of seeing him like that was the bleakest moment I've ever had."" An American family's holiday had turned into a nightmare. Nicholas died in hospital days later, after entering a coma. But before he did, his parents made a decision which would change the lives of seven families across Italy - they decided to donate his organs. ""At that point, these people were just abstractions. You had no idea what kind of people they were. It was like giving money to charity but you've no idea how it helps. Four months afterwards, we were invited to go back and meet them all in Sicily, where four of the recipients are from,"" says Green. Back row left to right: Reg Green, Maggie Green, Andrea Mongiardo, Francesco Mondello, Tino Motta, Anna Maria Di Ceglie, Eleanor Green. Seated: Laura Green, Maria Pia Pedala, Domenica Galleta, Silvia Ciampi, Martin Green Andrea Mongiardo: Heart, died in 2017 Francesco Mondello: Cornea Tino Motta: Kidney Anna Maria Di Ceglie: Kidney Maria Pia Pedala: Liver Domenica Galleta: Cornea Silvia Ciampi: Pancreas, presumed to have died several years ago Criminals in Italy rarely kill children, Green says, because it makes the police so determined to catch the killers. This is what happened in Nicholas's case. A no-holds-barred police investigation resulted in the arrest and conviction of two men, Francesco Mesiano and Michele Iannello. It's still unclear whether the men were robbers, or hitmen who attacked the wrong car in a case of mistaken identity, but the fact that one of them employs one of Italy's top lawyers suggests to Green that they have mafia connections. ""The killing of a seven-year-old American boy in a country where violent death is commonplace has plunged Italy into national soul-searching,"" the Times reported. Green says that the idea of an innocent child being shot while on holiday in the country made many Italians feel ashamed - and led them to embrace the idea of organ donation as a way of making amends. Andrea Mongiardo (centre left), who received Nicholas's heart, pictured in Milan in 1987 with his triplet cousins Marta, Valentina and Marco ""The work we have done to remind them of how much good could come out of this has had this quite astonishing effect which we couldn't possibly have foreseen. A country that was almost at the bottom for organ donation in Europe could immediately move almost to the top. No other country has tripled organ donation."" In 1993, the year before Nicholas was shot, 6.2 people per million donated an organ, while by 2006 the figure had reached 20 per million. During that period, in 1999, Italy moved to an opt-out system, where when someone dies it is presumed they are willing for their organs to be donated unless they have specified otherwise. France, Greece, Portugal and Spain also use an opt-out system, while the US and UK (with the exception of Wales) continue to operate an opt-in system. Nicholas Green square in Cassino is one of many places in Italy bearing the child's name In Italy, there are more than 120 places named in Nicholas's honour: 50squares and streets 27parks and gardens 27schools 16other monuments and installations, including a lemon tree, a bridge and an amphitheatre This garden in Turin also pays tribute to Reg's son ""Nicholas was a kindly boy who always looked for the best in things so, when you were with him, you always wanted to be your best,"" explains his father. ""I know that at seven years old he probably wouldn't have been able to comprehend but, I know, as he grew up this is just what he would have wanted us to do - there's no doubt about that. ""If the choice was between being angry at the people who did it and wanting to help somebody else as the first priority, he would have undoubtedly chosen helping somebody out."" Green, who worked as a journalist on Fleet Street for many years before moving to the US, says his son taught him a lot about tolerance. ""I'm impatient and when things go wrong, I get het up about it,"" he says. ""Nicholas had a calmness about it all and a forgivingness that made you want to be the same."" Reg recently met with Maria who, after recovering from liver failure, gave birth to a boy she named Nicholas Nothing could have prepared Green for the moment he came face-to-face with those people whose lives were saved by Nicholas's organs. ""When the doors opened and the six walked in, the effect was overwhelming,"" he says, noting that illness prevented one from being present. ""Some were smiling, some were tearful, others were bashful but they were all alive. Most of these people had been on the point of death. That's when it hit you for the first time, just how big a thing this was. ""There was also a sense of how the parents and grandparents would have been devastated. You got the feeling there were many more people involved whose lives would have been much poorer if we hadn't saved them."" Green and his wife Maggie, who married in April 1986, were keen to ensure that Eleanor did not grow up alone. They have since had twins, Laura and Martin, who will turn 21 in May.  What impact has the death of Green's son had on his life? ""There's a sadness that was never there before. I'm never completely happy any more,"" Green says. ""Even when I'm at my happiest, I think: 'Wouldn't it be better if Nicholas was here?'"" Nicholas pictured in Switzerland days before he was fatally shot Butl'effetto Nicholas- the Nicholas Effect - is a silver lining. ""I feel that every time there is a piece in the newspaper, TV or radio, there is going to be somebody in the audience who is going to have to make this decision. If they have never heard or thought about organ donation before, they are much more likely to say 'no'."" BBC - Earth - There are diseases hidden in ice, and they are waking up Prince Philip's (in)famous gaffes Green returns to Italy twice a year to raise awareness about organ donation. On his most recent visit he met Maria Pia Pedala, who had been in a coma from liver failure on the day Nicholas died, but quickly bounced back to health after receiving his liver. She married two years later, and two years after that gave birth to a baby boy - named Nicholas - who was followed in two years by a girl, Alessia. The three of them travelled from Sicily, where organ donation was almost unknown in 1994 Green says, to take part with him in a television programme in Milan. Green points out that even the recipient of Nicholas's heart, Andrea Mongiardo, who died earlier this year, had the organ three times longer than Nicholas himself did. But he sees his son's legacy extending far beyond the seven people who received Nicholas's organs. Because donation rates soared after Nicholas's death, he says, thousands of people are now alive who would otherwise have died.

Reality Check: Is UK crime up or down under Tories?,"In a spat on the BBC's Question Time programme on Thursday, Conservative minister David Davis and Labour's Rebecca Long-Bailey clashed on crime rates in England and Wales. Mr Davis, the Brexit secretary, claimed that in the six years that Theresa May served as home secretary, from 2010 to 2016, crime came down by 30%. But Ms Long-Bailey, shadow business secretary, claimed that in the last year ""violence against the person"" offences had increased by 19%. Both are talking about England and Wales only because Scotland and Northern Ireland have separate criminal justice systems. Reality Check has been looking through the figures and what they mean. The easy answer is that they are selecting figures from different ways of measuring different aspects of crime - neither is wrong but the more difficult question is which best represents how much crime people are actually experiencing. Let's take each figure in turn. Mr Davis is using figures from the Crime Survey for England and Wales. This is a face-to-face survey of 38,000 adults and children in which they are asked about their experiences of crime in the previous year. Until 2016, the survey did not include fraud and cyber crime. If you exclude those crimes in order to compare like with like, then between 2010 and 2016, crime fell by 35%. If you were to include those offences that were added in 2016, it would look like the crime rate has gone up. The Crime Survey is generally considered a good measure of crime experienced by individuals because it is not affected by changes to how crime is recorded. It also includes crimes that have historically been under-reported to the police - for example, domestic abuse. This means the overall crime rate recorded by the survey is always higher than the number of crimes recorded by the police. Only an estimated 42% of all crimes recorded in the Crime Survey are reported to the police. However, it has some limitations. It does not cover crimes against businesses or people living in communal residences like care homes, prisons or student accommodation. It is also excludes crimes where there is no victim to interview, for example homicides and drug offences. And there is also a time-lag in the survey, so the figures are older than police figures. This means the survey is very good for looking at long-term trends but less good at spotting emerging ones. Reality Check: Are there 20,000 fewer police? Why nobody seems to know whether crime is up or down Ms Long-Bailey is using police recorded crime to arrive at a 19% increase in violent crime in a year. About half of those recorded offences did not result in injury. Police recorded crime is a good measure of offences that are well-reported to the police but their accuracy has been called into question in recent years because of changes in methodology and they are no longer designated as national statistics. TheOffice for National Statistics,external(ONS) says part of the rise is a genuine increase in crime in some areas, for example knife crime in London. But some of it will be down to both changes in recording practices, and focused efforts from police to tackle certain crimes which leads to higher levels being recorded. Two new harassment offences were added to the category ""violence against the person"". If you exclude these offences, the rise in total violent crimes is 14%. There have been recent improvements in recording certain offences, such as modern slavery, which will push up the figures. However, in the long term injuries from violence recorded by the NHS back up the idea that violence has generally been falling over time, not just under Mrs May's watch but since 1997. What the crime figures say depends on which ones you choose to look at. Researchers at the ONS say on balance the evidence suggests there have been some genuine increases in certain types of crime over the last year but the long-term trend is that violence has been falling, not just under Mrs May's watch but for the last 20 years.

8 reasons why Angels in America feels like heaven,"Andrew Garfield as Prior Walter in Angels in America Plays don't come much more epic than Angels in America. Set amid the Aids crisis in 1980s America, Tony Kushner's ""gay fantasia"" lasts roughly the same duration as a flight from London to New York. Over eight hours, it packs in angelic visitations, burning books and surreal trips to icy continents and, of course, heaven. And let's not forget a stellar cast that includes Andrew Garfield, Denise Gough, Nathan Lane and Russell Tovey. After weeks of previews, the play officially opened at the National Theatre in London on Thursday. James McArdle (Louis) and Andrew Garfield (Prior) Spider-Man star Garfield told us after the show:  ""You don't often get to work on a character like this or on a story that has so much humanity in it. ""It's the whole human experience in one seven and a half hour play. No one would turn that opportunity down."" The critics seem to love it, withfour,externalandfive,externalstar reviews appearing on Friday morning. Here are eight reasons why Angels in America is such a heavenly show. On Thursday, both parts of the play played back to back - and lasted seven hours and 32 minutes. Part one - titled Millennium Approaches - kicked off at 13:00, but it wasn't until after 23:00 that the second part - Perestroika - had reached its emotional climax. But it never dragged. Much of the interval chat was about how quickly it seemed to go. The cast may disagree. Speaking after the show, Russell Tovey admitted: ""On a two-show day, it's insane. It's like a 12-hour Zumba class!"" The way the play is broken up gives it an episodic feel. Each part has two 15-minute intervals. That makes watching the play feel a bit like you are working your way through a TV box-set. With plenty of loo and coffee breaks. The ex-Spider-Man is unforgettable as Prior Walter, a man who discovers he has Aids and is then abandoned by his boyfriend Louis Ironside (James McArdle). We see him early on as an elegant drag queen, later he's a spectral hooded figure dressed top to toe in black. In the harrowing hospital scenes, he can switch from rage to despair in the course of a single line. Back in January, Garfield found out about his Oscar nomination for Hacksaw Ridge while he was starting rehearsals for Angels in America. It would be astonishing if he's not nominated for more awards for this performance. Nathan Lane plays foul-mouth lawyer Roy Cohn who is in denial about his sexuality.  Told by his doctor that he has Aids, he storms: ""No. Aids is what homosexuals have. I have liver cancer."" Tovey plays Joe Pitt, a closeted gay Mormon Republican whose Valium-addicted wife Harper is played with gusto by the Olivier-winning Denise Gough. McArdle is excellent as Prior's tormented lover, as is Nathan Stewart-Jarrett as hospital nurse Belize. With more than 30 characters in this play, all of the main cast play multiple parts and it's fun to try and spot them under the costume changes. Marianne Elliott is the award-winning talent behind the National Theatre's West End hits War Horse and The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time. Enough said. Denise Gough and Nathan Stewart-Jarrett in a fantasy Antarctic The story begins quite modestly, with a simple revolving set showing us how the lives of the main characters connect. Later it all goes much larger scale and a lot more surreal. We get a fantasy Antarctica - complete with falling snow - and a neon ladder that ascends to a heaven filled with angels. Yet many of the most memorable scenes are the intimate ones where Prior Walter and lawyer Roy Cohn are sick in their hospital beds and visited by both the living and the dead. As foul-mouthed Roy Cohn, Nathan Lane gets many of the best lines Angels in America had its British premiere at the National Theatre in 1992 (with a cast that included James Bond actor Daniel Craig). The play is set in New York in the mid-1980s when Ronald Reagan was starting his second term as president and the world was in the grip of the Aids crisis. While there is much that is upsetting, Kushner's script is packed with zinging comedy lines. ""It's very funny,"" said Garfield after the show.  ""You need to laugh to keep from crying in a situation as devastating as these characters  are going through. ""It was amazing putting it in front of an audience for the first time because we were all surprised how funny it was. ""On the first preview it was shocking how many times we had to stop for the audience laughing."" You won't forget Amanda Lawrence's Angel in a hurry. She crashes dramatically through Prior's apartment ceiling on massive wings that are operated - War Horse style - by six people. She flies, she swoops and she even has sex with Prior. Little wonder he later introduces himself to Harper Pitt as ""an angel-ologist"". Angels in America: A Gay Fantasia on National Themes is at the Lyttelton Theatre until 19 August.

Why we still choose to work in our 90s,"""Age is nothing but a number,"" the saying goes, and Prince Philip has shown you can still carry on working into your 90s. The Duke of Edinburgh has decided to stand down from public engagements at the age of 95, with the full support of the Queen. He carried out 110 days of engagements in 2016, making him the fifth busiest member of the Royal Family - despite his age. Here other nonagenarians reveal why they are still working and whether they plan on reaching Prince Philip's milestone. Ella Towell, 90, works two days a week at the Claire House Children's Hospice charity shop in Mold, north Wales. Her previous jobs included working in an engineering firm, a canteen and as a factory supervisor. Ella Towell says it is not difficult to get up for work as she has never needed much sleep ""I decided to start volunteering because I had a look around the Claire House Children's Hospice and was impressed with the nursing staff and I thought, 'Gosh, I'd like to help.' ""I spoke to the manageress of the shop in Buckley and she said, 'Get here now and get your coat off.' I worked every day there for six years. ""My family started grumbling at me that I was always in the shop and wanted to take me out so I decided to retire at 86. I had only stopped two weeks when the area manageress asked me to do two days a week in the Mold shop so I did. ""I still want to do it because of when I went to the hospice. The nurses and volunteers there should have Victoria Crosses. ""It's not difficult getting up and getting into the shop. I'm downstairs before five o'clock in the morning. I don't go to bed early but I've never needed that much sleep. ""I'm still active. My usual routine is get up, first big mug of tea with a tablespoon of whisky in it. I've done it for years and I haven't got arthritis. ""I serve customers behind the counter and I'm on the till at the shop. People aren't surprised I'm working at 90, they know what I'm like. ""I don't have any plans to give it up for good. I still feel I'm able to help the community at large, especially places like Claire House. ""Children's welfare interests me. If someone comes into the shop with a kiddy in a pushchair, I'm there pulling faces. ""If I can carry on until 95 I will do. You can never predict what your health will be like, but I hope so."" Irene Astbury, 90, works full time at Pet Food Supplies in Macclesfield, Cheshire. She set up the shop with her late husband, Les, 36 years ago. Irene Astbury, with members of her family, works in a pet shop set up with her late husband ""We opened the shop on 9 March 1981 and took Â£9 that day. We thought, 'What have we let ourselves in for?' as it was slow to begin with. ""I've been coming to the shop for the last 36 years and don't know any different. It's not hard working 40 hours a week as it's what I know. ""People can't believe and are quite surprised when they hear I'm 90. ""I still serve a few customers and will answer the phone occasionally. ""I enjoy making everyone a cup of tea and toast at brew time and my three great-grandchildren, Evie (six), Isabelle (three) and Harry (one), come to the shop most days. I enjoy seeing them and playing 'shops' with the older two girls. ""I still enjoy working, even at my age. I enjoy meeting people and customers and talking to them as I'm interested in what they're all up to. ""I don't have any plans at all to retire. As long as my legs will still bring me to the shop I have no plans to stop working. ""My gran was 102 when she died so I have a long way to go yet. ""The secret to a long and active life is to keep going, enjoy it, along with good health. ""I can still see myself working up until the age of 95 just like Prince Philip did. Longer if I can."" Want to age well - how about never retiring? The women still working into their 70s Still working at 100 years old Cliff Parker, 90, works for Focus Education, a company founded by his daughter, Linda, which provides educational support to primary schools and academies, in Saddleworth, Oldham. He served in the army during the 1940s and went on to become a grocer, landlord and worked for Oldham Council. Cliff Parker says he chooses to work because he does not want to sit at home and do nothing ""I choose to still work at the age 90 because it gives me something to get up for in the morning. ""I bind educational books in the mornings, and in the afternoon I deliver books and parcels to schools. I'm the errand boy in the afternoons. ""I like being busy and being around people, no-one can bind books as good as me. ""It's not difficult to get up for every morning for work. I am always up early. ""I could start later in a morning if I wanted to do, but I enjoy going to work and joining in with the staff and I love being with company. ""I don't want to retire, working is what keeps me going. I don't want to sit at home and do nothing. ""People can't believe I am still working at my age, they say it's brilliant. ""I love going to work every morning and it gives me a purpose in life.

The word that sank Australian LGBT petition,"Celebrities including Guy Pearce, Missy Higgins and Troye Sivan were attached to the petition It was a well-meaning campaign designed to address bullying of LGBT students in Australian schools. But a day after its high-profile launch - backed by some celebrities - the petition was withdrawn following a swirl of controversy. On Tuesday the open letter, organised by a Sydney man, called on Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull to commit A$6m (Â£4m; $4.5m) to funding a new anti-bullying programme. With a focus on LGBT [lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender] issues in schools and domestic violence, the programme would target ""all forms of bullying, including that which is based on religion, race, gender, faith, sexuality, disability, skin conditions, social standing or political persuasions"", the letter said. It followed an intensely debated similar scheme,Safe Schools,external, which was launched in 2014 but was significantly curtailed and then dumped in one state after criticism from conservative politicians, lobby groups and sections of the media. The critics said it raised sexual issues that were inappropriate for teenagers and young children. Death focuses Australia on LGBT bullying LGBT anti-bullying programmes have been intensely debated in Australia Tuesday's proposal was intended to ""de-politicise"" and remove ""controversy"" surrounding LGBT education in schools. Celebrities including actor Guy Pearce and singers Troye Sivan and Missy Higgins attached their names to the petition. It even attracted qualified support from an unlikely source. The Australian Christian Lobby - a conservative group critical of Safe Schools - said it ""cautiously welcomed"" the new proposal. But it attracted immediate criticism for urging ""tolerance"" - rather than ""acceptance"". ""Make no mistake of our request: we do not seek a program that seeks approval of the way certain members of our society live. We seek only mutual respect and tolerance,"" the petition said. Critics of the wording included LGBT advocates and, quickly, goodwill that might have flowed from passionate supporters of Safe Schools descended into anger. ""It sounds to me like I'm supposed to beg people to be tolerant of my child's existence,"" Leanne Donnelly, identified as a Sydney mother of a transgender teenager, told theSpecial Broadcasting Service,external. ""Equality and acceptance is the starting point, not downgrading to tolerance."" Some celebrities attached to the letter said they had not seen the wording before it was published. Petition organiser Ben Grubb, a PR adviser, wrote alengthy apology,externalto the LGBT community following the backlash. ""Acceptance was removed during the drafting after confidentially consulting a Canberra decision-maker on what they believed the government would potentially back to fund such a program,"" he wrote, adding his involvement in the campaign was personal not professional. ""This is a decision I deeply regret and I am truly sorry for. I am sorry to the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex community, many of whom have told me that by doing this represented the letter pandering to conservative views."" He said he would arrange for the petition to be taken down. It and an accompanying publicity video are no longer visible online.

Five big consequences of Trumpcare win,"Obamacare repeal lives to see another day, thanks to a concerted effort on the part of the White House and Republican leadership in Congress over the past few weeks. Passage of the American Health Care Act in the House of Representatives is just round one in a much longer battle, but there's no denying that Thursday's vote will have significant, lasting consequences. Here are five of them. A month and a half ago House Republicans tried to pass the original version of the American Health Care Act and had to pull it from consideration before a vote it appeared destined to lose. ""Moving from an opposition party to a governing party comes with growing pains,"" House Speaker Paul Ryan lamented that day. ""And, well, we're feeling those growing pains today."" In the Oval Office, a chastened president spoke with reporters. ""We learned a lot about loyalty,"" he said. ""We learned a lot about the vote-getting process."" This video can not be played Paul Ryan was discouraged after Obamacare repeal failed in March The setback was cited as evidence of fissures within the Republican Party and an indication that Mr Trump wasn't the grand negotiator he imagined he was. It proved to be an open wound that the party couldn't get past. Although the president said it was his intention to move on to tax reform, and Mr Ryan said Obamacare would be around ""for the foreseeable future"", the White House and congressional leaders continued to grind away at finding a compromise that would garner enough party support to pass. In the end they found it - by first locking down the House Freedom Caucus conservatives and then peeling away enough moderates to put them over the top. Barely. It was all smiles in the White House Rose Garden on Thursday afternoon, however, as Mr Trump and Mr Ryan were able to put their first major legislative accomplishment on the board. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has his work cut out for him With passage in the House of Representatives, the legislation now moves to the Senate, where it will face even greater challenges. While Mr Ryan had a large Republican majority in the House, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell can only afford to lose two votes - and already some members of his party are expressing reservations. ""I don't support the House bill as currently constructed because I continue to have concerns that this bill does not do enough to protect Ohio's Medicaid Expansion population,"" Senator Rob Portman said ina press release,external."" Bloomberg Newsreported,externalthat several key Republican senators were already making plans to disregard the House bill and craft their own healthcare legislation from scratch. Coming up with a solution that satisfies both hard-liners and moderates will be a formidable task in the Senate, as it proved to be in the House. Democratic senators, who have considerable powers even in the minority, will disrupt the process whenever possible. It's a recipe for a political logjam that will be difficult to resolve. ""I know that our friends in the Senate are eager to get to work,"" Mr Ryan said at the White House celebratory event on Thursday. The crowd of Republican politicians and staffers laughed. They know better. If the House bill as written were to become law itwould send shockwavesthrough the US healthcare system, forcing insurance companies, medical providers and related companies to adjust to a new reality just years after Obamacare reforms had caused their own upheavals. Medicaid, the health insurance programme for the poor, would see significant cuts. Government insurance mandates would be repealed. Taxes on wealthy individuals that paid for insurance subsidies for lower-income groups would be rescinded. States would be given greater discretion to do away with minimum levels of insurance coverage. According to the Congressional Budget Office, which analysed an earlier version of the legislation, more than 24 million more Americans would be uninsured under the American Health Care Act. Premiums would eventually drop around 10%. The federal budget deficit would go down by $150 billion over 10 years (although this number will surely change when the new version is scored next week). This video can not be played Healthcare battle in rural America Already the uncertainty is taking its toll. The last company participating in the Iowa individual insurance market may soon withdraw. Another major provider is pulling out of Virginia. In numerous states, the system for those who don't have insurance from the government or private employers is under significant strain. For a while it looked like the current Obamacare system would continue to muddle along intact, giving the healthcare industry some modicum of continuity. Instead the prospect of major change continues to loom on the horizon. Given that the Senate will likely have its own, markedly different version of reforms soon, that uncertainty is only likely to grow. Obamacare v Republican plan compared Trump health bill: Winners and losers Following the successful passage of the American Health Care Act in the House, Democrats on the floor waved to their Republican colleagues and sang ""Hey, hey, hey, goodbye"". The moment recalled similar behaviour by Republican legislators in 1993, when they mocked Democrats for backing a sweeping tax increase in the early days of the Bill Clinton administration. This video can not be played Protesters yell 'shame' at politicians over healthcare bill The Democratic Party suffered a resounding defeat in the midterm elections of 1994, and Democrats believe this vote will have a similar devastating effect on their adversaries in the November 2018 elections. What's certain is that Democratic candidates are going to do their best to paint the bill as a major tax cut for the rich, paid for with reduced benefits for the middle class and working poor. Already one Democrat running for governor in Virginia has cut atelevision advert,externalcondemning the bill, featuring an ambulance being slowly crushed in a compactor. The nature of the House bill, which gives states considerable discretion in rolling back Obamacare, could also cast a spotlight on the 38 governor races in the next two years, as well as the battles for control of state legislatures. Republicans currently have the upper hand across much of the US, but their majorities could be at risk if a Democratic electoral wave emerges. Obamacare was the crown jewel of President Barack Obama's legislative achievements. Democrats paid a dear price at the ballot box for enacting the reforms, but it was a decades-long goal for the party that was viewed, by many, to be worth the sacrifice. US President Barack Obama signs the Affordable Health Care for America Act in March 2010 ""This is a big effing deal,"" Vice-President Joe Biden memorably whispered to Mr Obama during the law's White House signing ceremony. Now that big deal is one step closer to being a relic of the past. At the same time the Obamacare repeal bill moved on to the Senate, a House committee approved legislation rolling back Mr Obama's Wall Street financial reforms. Step by step, the Republican-controlled Congress may be taking an axe to everything the Democrats accomplished during Mr Obama's eight years in office. Environmental regulations are in the crosshairs, as is much of the tax-and-spending policy compromises Democrats and Republicans agreed on in 2013 Elections, as they say, have consequences.

Is live streaming your life good business or dangerous?,"Samantha Firth has attracted 350,000 fans on live streaming site Live.me Live streaming is becoming big business, with millions of people around the world broadcasting the minutiae of their daily lives in real time to adoring fans - and making small fortunes in the process. But is it safe? Samantha Firth, a 21-year-old nanny living in Chicago, walks to the subway with her friend. So far, so ordinary. But she is simultaneously broadcasting her 15-minute journey live via her mobile to thousands of avid followers. ""You guys are lit,"" she says excitedly as she looks at the stream of rolling messages and emojis that are popping up on her screen from her fans. ""I love you... you guys are the best,"" she exclaims, before heading onto the subway and zooming the camera in on a spot on her forehead. It used to be that only film stars would be famous, but thanks to reality TV, YouTube and bloggers, anyone can have their ""fifteen minutes"" of fame, as Andy Warhol predicted. The proliferation of live broadcasting tools, pioneered by Meerkat several years ago and followed by the likes of Periscope, Facebook, YouTube and others, has given many young people the chance to broadcast every aspect of their lives - whether they're brushing their hair in their bedroom or out dancing with friends. In China alone, the entertainment live streaming market is valued at Â£5bn, according to Credit Suisse. And in the US, 63% of 18-34 year-olds are watching live content and 42% creating it, finds a study by UBS Evidence Lab. Big business: Live.me recently raised $60m from investors But for many like Ms Firth, this isn't just narcissistic fun, it's a cash cow. She joined Live.me - owned by China's Cheetah Mobile - eight months ago after moving from Sydney to Chicago. The live-in nanny has since become one of the most popular broadcasters on the site, amassing 350,000 fans. These devotees bombard her with virtual gifts - animated stickers that can be converted into ""diamonds"" and then real money - helping her pull in about $21,000 (Â£16,300) a month. ""Coming from a different country it has been difficult to make friends, but this app has allowed me to connect with people who have the same interests,"" she says of her reasons for joining. ""I spend most of my free time broadcasting because it's where most of my friends are."" She is keen to portray a candid version of herself, pimples and all. ""I don't wear make-up, I wear sweatshirts and sweatpants,"" she says. ""Sometimes I cry when someone says something hurtful on a broadcast."" Like Live.me, live streaming platform YouNow enables these citizen broadcasters to make money from fans sending them virtual gifts. Fans of some streaming sites can also subscribe monthly to their favourite live streamers. Emma McGann thinks her live broadcasts have helped boost her music career It's been a real moneyspinner for the top broadcasters, who can earn up to $200,000 (Â£155,000) a year. Singer Emma McGann, 26, broadcasts live from her studio in Coventry, England, for three to six hours every day. She says her live streams attract about 5-10,000 unique views. YouNow not only provides her with a good salary - she earns Â£2,000-3,000 a month via the channel - but it has helped her gain exposure for her music. ""It enabled me to get a single in the iTunes chart,"" she says. ""It's also a great testing ground for new material."" ""I like the live element. I like to interact with the audience and take song requests."" Fans can also speak to her over the internet. While many brands are already running their own live streaming sessions, We Are Social head of strategy Harvey Cossell believes there are opportunities for brands to capitalise on live streaming by co-creating with individuals who have already amassed a loyal audience. The success of such collaborations in the social gaming world, on sites such as Twitch, are a case in point. ""They would need to identify those people that represent a similar set of values to the brand in question and then find creative ways to partner with them in the production of their content,"" he advises. The challenge, he warns, is one of authenticity. ""It's always better for brands either to partner with the right person, or do nothing at all."" Live streaming site YouNow has 34 million registered users Some researchers are forecasting,externalthat the live streaming business will be worth $70bn globally by 2021. But for all its engagement value and monetisation potential, you only have to search online to see that live streaming has its dark side. Earlier this year,12-year-old Katelyn Nicole Davis took her own life and broadcast it liveon Live.me, while there have been many reports about paedophiles watching live streaming of child sex abuse. ""Live streaming apps and sites can expose young people to graphic and distressing content and can leave them vulnerable to bullying and online harassment,"" an NSPCC [National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children] spokesman tells the BBC. ""Worryingly, live chat can also be used by groomers to target young people who may be manipulated into sending sexual images and videos."" Khudor Annous, head of marketing and partnerships at Live.me, says the company has a number of safeguards, including a facial recognition tool that can supposedly spot anyone who's under the age of 13 on the app. ""If they are in fact under the age of 13, then we ban the account,"" says Mr Annous. ""We have also provided users with reporting tools to report a channel if they identify a child in the app. We're typically able to evaluate reports within a couple of hours depending on daily volume."" As for grooming, he says: ""Every user has the ability to report any suspicious behaviour before, or any violations of our community guidelines. We also work with the FBI and local law enforcement agencies around the globe to ensure the safety of our community."" But there are also concerns that the broadcasters are themselves exploiting young people. Clinical psychologist Linda Blair describes the rise of young people live streaming as ""very sad"". She adds: ""It's an indication of loneliness. They might temporarily feel great but it's only a distraction."" But with millions of people already using live streaming platforms, including Facebook Live, we can expect the number of everyday broadcasters to continue growing. ""I see live streaming following a path similar to social networking, where at first it started as a place for people to connect with each other but eventually evolved into a powerful platform for advertising, marketing, and publishing,"" says Paul Verna, principal analyst at eMarketer. Mr Cossell also believes that live video will expand into other formats. ""It will begin to harness emerging technologies such as 360-video and virtual reality more readily,"" he says. ""Live streaming is clearly here to stay.""

Reality Check: Is crime up or down under Tories?,"In a spat on the BBC's Question Time programme on Thursday, Conservative minister David Davis and Labour's Rebecca Long-Bailey clashed on crime rates in England and Wales. Mr Davis, the Brexit secretary, claimed that in the six years that Theresa May served as home secretary, from 2010 to 2016, crime came down by 30%. But Ms Long-Bailey, shadow business secretary, claimed that in the last year ""violence against the person"" offences had increased by 19%. Both are talking about England and Wales only because Scotland and Northern Ireland have separate criminal justice systems. Reality Check has been looking through the figures and what they mean. The easy answer is that they are selecting figures from different ways of measuring different aspects of crime - neither is wrong but the more difficult question is which best represents how much crime people are actually experiencing. Let's take each figure in turn. Mr Davis is using figures from the Crime Survey for England and Wales. This is a face-to-face survey of 38,000 adults and children in which they are asked about their experiences of crime in the previous year. Until 2016, the survey did not include fraud and cyber crime. If you exclude those crimes in order to compare like with like, then between 2010 and 2016, crime fell by 35%. If you were to include those offences that were added in 2016, it would look like the crime rate has gone up. The Crime Survey is generally considered a good measure of crime experienced by individuals because it is not affected by changes to how crime is recorded. It also includes crimes that have historically been under-reported to the police - for example, domestic abuse. This means the overall crime rate recorded by the survey is always higher than the number of crimes recorded by the police. Only an estimated 42% of all crimes recorded in the Crime Survey are reported to the police. However, it has some limitations. It does not cover crimes against businesses or people living in communal residences like care homes, prisons or student accommodation. It is also excludes crimes where there is no victim to interview, for example homicides and drug offences. And there is also a time-lag in the survey, so the figures are older than police figures. This means the survey is very good for looking at long-term trends but less good at spotting emerging ones. Reality Check: Are there 20,000 fewer police? Why nobody seems to know whether crime is up or down Ms Long-Bailey is using police recorded crime to arrive at a 19% increase in violent crime in a year. About half of those recorded offences did not result in injury. Police recorded crime is a good measure of offences that are well-reported to the police but their accuracy has been called into question in recent years because of changes in methodology and they are no longer designated as national statistics. TheOffice for National Statistics,external(ONS) says part of the rise is a genuine increase in crime in some areas, for example knife crime in London. But some of it will be down to both changes in recording practices, and focused efforts from police to tackle certain crimes which leads to higher levels being recorded. Two new harassment offences were added to the category ""violence against the person"". If you exclude these offences, the rise in total violent crimes is 14%. There have been recent improvements in recording certain offences, such as modern slavery, which will push up the figures. However, in the long term injuries from violence recorded by the NHS back up the idea that violence has generally been falling over time, not just under Mrs May's watch but since 1997. What the crime figures say depends on which ones you choose to look at. Researchers at the ONS say on balance the evidence suggests there have been some genuine increases in certain types of crime over the last year but the long-term trend is that violence has been falling, not just under Mrs May's watch but for the last 20 years.

How Brad Pitt fixed his image problem with one interview,"Brad Pitt has chosen the pages (and website) of a glossy magazine to give his first interview since splitting from Angelina Jolie amid accusations he'd hit their teenage son. It was a calculated attempt to rehabilitate his image - and it seems to have worked. It's seven months since Brangelina broke apart against the backdrop of reports of a physical altercation between Brad and 15-year-old Maddox on a private plane. Social workers and the FBI took no action against Pitt. There were also rumours of an affair with his co-star Marion Cotillard - which she denied. But his reputation had been called into question and he has kept a low profile since. So how does one of Hollywood's biggest stars begin to fix his image and move on? The answer seems to be - by doing an eight-day photoshoot mucking about in America's national parks and a long, confessional and philosophicalinterview with GQ Style,external. As one of the most famous people on the planet, Pitt had to talk about his problems sooner or later, attempt to take control of the story and move on. And he's got a new film coming out - which gets several prominent mentions in the article. He needs to promote that by talking to the media, as he will need to do for future releases. He can't dodge the subject of his divorce and personal problems. But he can choose which outlet he uses to speak about them, and what they say. In giving his first post-split interview to GQ Style, he's chosen a publication that is glossy in both format and interview tone. GQ correspondent Michael Paterniti's questioning was gently probing but sympathetic. He didn't ask what went on in the plane. The choice of GQ wasn't likely to put too many rival media noses out of joint, and was guaranteed to be picked up by virtually every news outlet around the world. And he will have had control over what went in the article, according to PR guru Mark Borkowski. ""Total copy approval, total picture approval, total headline approval,"" he says. Pitt ""looks good and has admitted he's had a problem,"" Borkowski says. ""So it's very transparent and very honest. To be as upfront and direct as he's been, it is a remarkable moment in his career."" The headlines from the interview have been, depending on which website or paper you read:Brad has had therapy to get through his divorce;he's admitted drink problems,external;he listened to Frank Ocean to get over the split,external; andhe wore the same $1,000 (Â£775) tank top as Harry Styles,external. In the bits about his divorce, he is conciliatory and admits the chaos of the past half-year has been ""self-inflicted"", but he's putting ""family first"". He ""refuses"" to get into a vicious court battle with Angelina and says they've got to handle the situation with ""great care and delicacy"" for the children. Verdict? He's the honest and sensitive guy we always knew he was. E! published an article headlined:Why Brad Pitt won the Jolie-Pitt war by throwing himself on his sword,external. ""This interview could have been a more obstinate denial of wrongdoing on Pitt's part,"" E!'s Natalie Finn wrote. ""Yet it was quite the opposite. ""Throwing caution to the wind - and simultaneously capitalizing on 30 years of good will built up in Hollywood - Brad went for it, translating what he's gleaned from his newfound love of therapy into a painfully self-aware, self-deprecating, oft-poetic and at times rambling discourse on a charmed life that veered off course and what he's doing to right the ship."" In Vanity Fair,external, Kenzie Bryant wrote: ""Pitt clearly studied the lay-it-all-bare, heart-on-my-sleeve, owning-my-flaws interview section of the post-celebrity-divorce playbook. ""Learning from his tumultuous year is a theme of the talk, especially regarding the divorce, which is still under way."" Bryant added: ""He comes across candid, remorseful, and keen to let the world know that he's doing a lot of work on himself."" And in an article praising his ""openness and honesty"" about his alcohol problemson Huffington Post,external, Ryan Hampton of Facing Addiction wrote: ""Brad, I lift a cranberry-and-Perrier to you. ""People like you do so much to give a face to the addiction crisis that claims so many lives. Thank you for your honesty, your courage, and your willingness to open up about your recovery."" Not everyone was totally convinced, though. Many celebrities would have tried to hide or snipe at their ex through the media, but Pitt is dealing with it ""in the most humane way possible"", Borkowski says. ""He was always going to be plagued with this story. So if you're going to talk about it, talk about it in full. ""But of course the timing is calculated, the language is calculated. Everything is calculated. And everything is a gamble. ""A lot of people prefer to stay below the waterline and not do it. He's taken a massive risk and I can think of many who just wouldn't go this far."" Follow us onFacebook,external, on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external, or on Instagram atbbcnewsents,external.

Mourinho vows to rest Man Utd players,"This video can not be played I will rest players in Premier League - Mourinho Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho says he will rest players for Sunday's Premier League trip to Arsenal. United's 1-0 Europa League semi-final first-leg win at Celta Vigo on Thursday was their 10th game since 1 April. With Mourinho's side lying fifth in the Premier League, the Europa League could represent their best chance of reaching next season's Champions League.

How prepared is the UK for a terrorist firearms attack?,"Britain is upgrading its armed police response to terror attacks, with Â£114m to fund an extra 1,000 armed police over five years. What capability does this buy, and how prepared is the UK for what is known as a marauding terrorist firearms attack? Wind the clock back to November 2008 and the answer was - almost totally unprepared. Over a near two-day period, a 10-man cell of heavily-armed jihadists from Pakistan carried out a prolonged massacre in the heart of India's commercial capital, Mumbai, killing 164 people. All over the world, police and counter-terrorism officials asked themselves the uncomfortable question: How would we cope if it happened here in our cities? In Britain there was a realisation that the police would probably be so outgunned that they would likely have to call in military assistance. Terrorism 'most immediate threat to UK' Threat 'at highest since 1970s IRA plots' Major counter-terrorism exercise in London At the very least, there would be an unacceptably long time gap between the first shots being fired by terrorists and the threat from them being eliminated, during which time large numbers of hostages could quite possibly have been killed. The national security response was to massively ""up-gun"" the police response. New, mobile armouries were introduced with modern high-powered weapons in the back, capable of bringing concentrated firepower onto a terrorist target. A series of realistic exercises were staged across the country, codenamed ""Wooden Pride"", involving police firearms officers, snipers, SAS operatives and even lawyers. Participants were made to take part in mock law courts where they had to explain to a sceptical ""judge"" exactly why they had pulled the trigger at certain points during the exercise. Police have been carrying out exercises to anticipate a wide variety of terror threats Today, while patently nowhere is entirely safe from terrorist attack, the precautions put in place have dramatically changed the security environment in London and other cities. Anyone watching the horrific events in Westminster on 22 March could not fail to notice the speed of the armed police response. Within minutes of a car being deliberately driven into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge, and the assailant then running into the Palace of Westminster, the whole area was sealed off by heavily armed specialist firearms officers (SFOs) from the Metropolitan Police's Specialist Firearms Command. They were carrying a mixture of powerful, recently-acquired weapons comprising the Swiss-made Sig Sauer SG516 5.56mm Automatic Rifle, the MCX Carbine variant with its telescopic stock and red dot sight, and the Austrian-made Glock 17 Pistol, a lightweight 9mm 17-round handgun often seen strapped to the right-hand leg. Another weapon in the SFO's armoury is the German-made Heckler & Koch G36 Carbine. All of these weapons have been steadily replacing the older Heckler & Koch MP5 Carbines, a familiar sight at Heathrow Airport and often mistakenly called submachine guns, (they are configured to fire single shots, not bursts of automatic fire). Police reacted within minutes to the Westminster terror attack The rapid response on 22 March was hardly surprising given that this attack took place in the heart of Whitehall. But throughout central London police Armed Response Vehicles (ARVs) are constantly patrolling, using BMW X5s with secured armouries in the back. In theory, these ARVs should never be more than eight minutes away from the scene of an incident. Similar arrangements exist in other major cities and regions across the country, such as the West Midlands. An even more specialised armed police unit involves Counter Terrorism Specialist Firearms Officers (CTSFOs), who reportedly arrived on the scene of the 22 March Westminster attack within six minutes. Originally formed for the London 2012 Olympics, they are recognisable by their grey uniforms, black Kevlar body armour, ballistic helmets, facemasks.  goggles and Velcro patches bearing the CTSFO logo. They are trained to tackle a wide spectrum of terrorist and hostage situations, including fast-roping down from Eurocopter EC-145 helicopters, and are equipped with a range of specialist equipment. This includes pump-action shotguns, polycarbonate body shields, chainsaws, crowbars and motorbikes capable of speeds up to 140mph. The ""physical"" response is only part of the picture in UK counter-terrorism activities But all of this ""physical"" response is, of course, only part of the picture in counter-terrorism. A major component of stopping attacks takes place out of public sight, much of it in cyberspace, a war waged daily by analysts and codebreakers at GCHQ and MI5. Tip-offs by the public have also been crucial. This week the National Police Chiefs Council revealed that in the last two monthsthe police had received more than 3,000 tip-offs by the public about possible terrorist attacks. Forging that link between the police and communities has taken years of painstaking work in this country, with frequent setbacks, but in several other European countries it is almost non-existent. So without timely and accurate intelligence no amount of state-of-the-art hardware will prevent the next attack.

Tory smiles and Labour grimaces,"Conservatives have made gains across England and Wales It's early, early days. But so far there will be grimaces at Labour HQ, beaming smiles at the Tory's CCHQ, and a slightly frazzled atmosphere at Lib Dem homes this morning - and don't be surprised if you see Nigel Farage at his favourite boozer by lunchtime. There are lots and lots of results still to come in. But with a general election only a month away, this barometer of real votes looks grim for the Labour Party. Local and mayoral elections: Conservatives make gains UKIP suffers big losses in council polls Election results: updates Senior sources say that it is national share that will matter, and they want to compare it with the election in 2015. But it is more accurate to look at the last time these seats were fought, which was in 2013. In comparison with that, Labour is so far falling back badly, despite holding on in some parts of Wales. Stephen Kinnock said the picture was 'disastrous' for Labour And we've just seen the first big blast at the Labour leadership from Stephen Kinnock, calling the picture ""disastrous"", and urging voters to do what I expect we'll hear other candidates do repeatedly in the next few weeks - making a pitch for a strong opposition, rather than Jeremy Corbyn as prime minister. The victims in most pain so far from voters' decisions yesterday are UKIP. Their vote has been collapsing, with, it seems, swathes switching straight over to the Tories. That is a political trick that Theresa May wants to repeat around the country in a few weeks' time. UPDATE: A senior Labour figure has just described the party's local election results as ""catastrophic"". As the counts continue, this set of results is proving to be very disappointing for Jeremy Corbyn's party. Officially the party is of course not as admitting as much, with sources suggesting in fact the result are not as bad as they had expected. Yet another senior Labour politician, not one of Corbyn's prominent critics says, this is the ""third time in a row we have gone backwards. There is no metric under which these results are not very bad."" I can't say enough that we need to be cautious about translating the results directly across to the General Election next month. Yet they are a useful barometer of real votes, that set a depressing backdrop for Labour's prospects in June.

UKIP suffers big losses in council polls,"UKIP has lost a swathe of council seats in England and Wales, leading to claims that the party is in crisis ahead of June's general election. In total, UKIP lost 145 councillors and secured one seat. It was wiped out in Lincolnshire, losing 13 seats, while all its nine representatives in Essex were defeated. Independent MEP Steven Woolfe said UKIP's influence was now ""at an end"" but party leader Paul Nuttall said it was a ""victim of its own success"". Election results: updates Tories make gains in local elections Six key lessons for the general election Mr Woolfe, who quit the party last year after an internal dispute, told BBC Radio 5 live that if the choice at next month's general election was between Conservative leader Theresa May and UKIP leader Paul Nuttall he would ""have to vote for Theresa May"". Former MP Douglas Carswell and UKIP donor Arron Banks also cast doubt on the future of the party while elections expert John Curtice said UKIP, which won 3.8 million votes at the 2015 general election, had lost ""everything they've been trying to defend"". It did win one seat from Labour on Lancashire County Council. Alan Hosker won in Padiham and Burnley West, a ward represented by the BNP between 2009 and 2013. UKIP's losses come just weeks before a general election in which the Conservatives are hoping to squeeze their vote. Sorry, your browser cannot display this map In Lincolnshire, where Mr Nuttall is standing in the general election in Boston and Skegness, UKIP went from being the official opposition to having no seats at all as the Tories gained 23 seats. It also lost eight seats in Hampshire, two seats on the Isle of Wight and eight in East Sussex. However, senior UKIP figures sought to put a brave face on the performance. By political correspondent Ben Wright The ""people's army"" has deserted its leaders. After years building its strength in local government, UKIP seems to be collapsing as its former supporters abandon the party for the Conservatives. UKIP lost all its seats in Hampshire, Essex and Lincolnshire. The east coast county was once a purple bastion and is where Paul Nuttall will try and win a parliamentary seat. The party's failure there encapsulates its demise. Will UKIP do better at the general election? Possibly. But these results mirror its slide in recent opinion polls. It now has no MPs, and when Britain leaves the EU it will lose all its MEPs too. The future for UKIP looks bleak. And of course it's easy to see why. The party's core purpose was to campaign for Britain to leave the EU. Now Brexit is happening, UKIP voters are walking away. But what is significant is how they are turning to the Tories in huge numbers. For more than a decade the eurosceptic right of British politics has been fractured. David Cameron saw UKIP eating into the Tory vote and promised an EU referendum to try to halt the march. Labour too lost many of its traditional working-class supporters to UKIP. But by embracing Brexit and squaring up to Brussels, it's Theresa May's Conservative Party reaping the reward. Mr Nuttall said it had been a ""difficult night"" but there was little the party could have done in the face of a ""big national swing"" to the Conservatives. ""Mrs May's public dispute with the EU in recent days - which led to her speaking about standing up to Brussels in an eve-of-poll statement in Downing Street - was particularly fortuitously timed for the Conservatives,"" he said. ""If the price of Britain leaving the EU is a Tory advance after taking up this patriotic cause, then it is a price UKIP is prepared to pay. ""We are the victims of our own success and now we pick ourselves up and go on to further success in the future."" UKIP's local government spokesman Peter Reeve maintained the party was still ""leading the national agenda"". He told the BBC: ""We are never happy when we are not winning seats - and today hasn't been good on that front. ""The reality is... the Conservative Party have painted themselves in UKIP colours, flying a UKIP flag, and the danger is they won't fulfil the promises and pledges they have now made. ""UKIP will have a resurgence when Theresa May's promises start to unravel."" Conservative defence secretary Michael Fallon said his party appeared to be picking up votes from UKIP and other parties, but he cautioned that this did not mean this would be case on 8 June.

Tory elected West of England mayor,"This video can not be played Conservative mayor Tim Bowles speaks of his pride in being elected. Conservative Tim Bowles has been elected as the first West of England combined authority mayor. Mr Bowles beat Labour candidate Lesley Ann Mansell after second preference votes were counted. Neither candidate reached the required 50% threshold to secure an initial victory, leading to second choice votes being counted from eliminated candidates. Turnout was only 29.7%, with 199,519 voting out of a possible 671,280. Election 2017: Full results from across England Mr Bowles secured a total of 70,300 votes following the second preference count, compared to Ms Mansell's 65,923. He said: ""From a personal perspective, I am honoured to be elected the first West of England regional mayor. ""I really look forward to working on behalf of everybody in the region to make the improvements we have all recognised throughout all of the campaign ... and to make the real differences for everybody throughout the region."" More reaction to to the West of England mayor result Labour candidate Lesley Ann Mansell said she helped to bring a message of hope to voters The metro mayor role covers the Bristol, South Gloucestershire and Bath and North East Somerset council areas. The Â£62,000 salaried post is part of government efforts to devolve more power to the regions over key issues such as planning and roads. As part of the devolution deal, the West of England Combined Authority will be given Â£1bn over 30 years to help plan new homes, regional transport and business growth. Ms Mansell said: ""We turned up the vote in the Labour constituencies and we have taken Labour's message of hope deep into Conservative constituencies and won 43,000 [first preference] votes. ""We've done that by talking to voters on the doorstep, addressing issues and pushing for a fairer and more just society."" While councillors are elected by a simple majority, the combined authority mayors are being chosen under the supplementary voting system - giving people a first and second choice. It means that if no candidate has won at least 50% of the vote, the top two candidates go to a second round with the second choice votes counted of everyone whose first choice was eliminated.

Straw draw denies Tories control,"This video can not be played The South Blyth seat was decided in an unusual way after two recounts failed to produce a winner The battle for control of a council ended with the drawing of straws after a dead heat in the crucial final ward. And the Conservative Party was denied overall control of Northumberland County Council after losing the unusual decider to the Liberal Democrats. The South Blyth ward result followed two recounts and left the Conservatives with 33 of the 67 seats available. Liberal Democrat candidate Lesley Rickerby described her defeat of Tory Daniel Carr as ""very traumatic"". The Lib Dems won following the drawing of straws Ms Rickerby said: ""It's unbelievable that, when you consider we have a democratic service, that we end up having to draw straws. ""I certainly would have preferred it to be a majority, but the way our system works, after a couple of recounts, we had no choice."" In addition to the 33 seats won by the Conservative party, Labour won 24, the Lib Dems three and Independents seven. Ms Rickerby added: ""The returning officer decides if we would flip a coin or draw straws and he went with straws. ""I certainly don't want to do that again in a hurry - it really was the last straw."" In another result, Labour retained control of Durham County Council despite losing 20 seats. The party won 94 seats in the 2013 election and that has now fallen to 74. Independent candidates have the second highest number of seats (28) followed by Liberal Democrats (14) and Conservatives (10).

Analysis: Where the parties stand so far,"Early results suggest a good night for the Tories but many votes are yet to be counted If the final result to be declared in these local elections, much, much later today, is the summit of the electoral mountain, this morning we are barely above sea level. Flip flops on, we are still on the beach. But for those of us up all night to witness the nocturnal arithmetic, clear trends began to emerge very quickly. The Conservatives up. Labour and UKIP down. The Liberal Democrats patchy. Live: Election coverage Tories make early gains Let's be more specific: Tories will rejoice on the basis of the results we have so far. They suggest the national opinion polls, giving their party substantial leads, are an accurate reflection of the sentiment of voters, and so will hope the prime minister's decision to call a general election will be rewarded with a significantly bigger majority next month. For Labour, the fears of those within the party who thought they would get a kicking are coming true, at least so far. Take Gillian Troughton. A case study in humiliation. In February, she fought the Copeland parliamentary by-election in Cumbria for Labour. It was an area that had returned a Labour MP for more than 80 years. Gillian Troughton lost out to the Conservatives, twice. But she lost, to the Conservatives. Now she's lost her seat on Cumbria County Council to the Tories as well. The swing from Labour to the Conservatives, across the results we have so far, is substantial. UKIP's vote is collapsing heavily. The party has been wiped out in Lincolnshire, the very spot where its leader Paul Nuttall will fight for a Westminster seat next month, in Boston and Skegness. What about the Liberal Democrats? They can point to some high moments: their former MP Tessa Munt beating the Conservative leader of Somerset County Council, for instance. But, for all their talk of a Lib Dem fight back, it is not amounting to much so far. There are those key words again though - so far. The night, and the day to follow it, is young.

UKIP is wiped off the map in Essex,"Former UKIP member Kerry Smith retained his seat on Essex County Council as an Independent UKIP has been wiped off the county map in Essex with the loss of nine seats in Thursday's election. The party was the biggest loser as the Conservatives took 56 of 75 seats to retain overall control - an increase of 14 compared to the last election in 2013. Labour lost three seats and the Liberal Democrats two, while Independent candidates gained two seats. UKIP's Mark Ellis said his party was ""not a spent force"". Live: Reaction to Essex County Council election results Mr Ellis, who lost his Laindon Park and Fryerns seat, added: ""People are listening to Theresa May - and she is pretty UKIP in my opinion - and unfortunately people are thinking UKIP is a spent force, which we are not. ""UKIP is here to stay."" In 2013, the Tories won 42 seats, while UKIP, Labour and the Liberal Democrats took nine seats each. The Conservatives now hold 56 seats, the Liberal Democrats seven and Labour six. The Canvey Island Independent Party holds two seats, Independents two, Green one and Independent Loughton Residents one. Michael Garnett was one of the Conservatives to take a Labour seat in Harlow UKIP's Mark Ellis, who lost his Laindon Park and Fryerns said his party was ""not a spent force"". The Conservatives took all four seats in Harlow, including two from Labour. Labour's Mike Danvers, who lost Harlow North to Tory Michael Garnett, was deputy leader of the Labour group on the county council. Election 2017: Full results from across England He said he believed he lost because UKIP had not fielded a candidate in the division. He said: ""UKIP people voted Tory. The Tory vote has zoomed up and overtaken me."" Dick Madden, a Conservative cabinet member on the county council who held his Moulsham seat, said: ""We did expect to make gains and we hoped we would be increasing our seats."" Candidates awaiting the count in Chelmsford Mike Mackrory, leader of the Liberal Democrats on the county council, said: ""Our number one priority was holding the seats we already had. ""We have managed to do that and increased our majorities on some seats."" The Conservatives have just smashed the Essex county council elections.  June's general election looks like a great chance for the Tories to take all 18 seats in Essex. UKIP came second four years ago now they don't have a single county councillor - their vote collapsed, including in Clacton, where the party won their only Westminster seat. Labour were wiped out in Harlow in Thursday's local elections and the town is one of their best chances of getting an MP. A Colchester comeback for the Lib Dems is possible, with former MP Sir Bob Russell standing, but they went backwards Thursday in their old backyard. The first result in Essex came in shortly after midnight when Kerry Smith, who quit UKIP in 2014, won Basildon Westley Heights with a majority of more than 2,000. He said the result was a reflection of his ""hard work"". John Jowers, the Conservative vice chairman of the county council who held his seat, said the council had ""lost some good guys"" with the UKIP seat losses. He said: ""You really do need to work together and cooperate in local government - it is not like the green benches in parliament. ""It is often the case that when things get politicized, they go wrong.""

My son died in 1994 but his heart just stopped beating,"On the night of 29 September 1994, seven-year-old Nicholas Green was fatally shot during a family holiday in southern Italy. The death was a tragedy for his parents, Reg and Maggie, but their decision to donate his organs caused organ donation rates in Italy to triple in a decade - a result dubbed the ""Nicholas effect"". ""The first time I sensed danger was when a dark car came up close behind us and stayed there for a few moments,"" says Reg Green, who is remembering the night his son was inexplicably shot by strangers in southern Italy. ""Shortly after, this car began to overtake. I relaxed, thinking there was nothing wrong after all."" But, instead of overtaking, the car drew alongside. Reg and Maggie heard loud angry cries. They assumed that the men inside wanted them to stop. ""I thought if we did stop we would be completely at their mercy. So instead I accelerated. They did too, so the two cars raced alongside each other through the night. A bullet shattered the back window. Maggie turned around and both the children appeared to be fast asleep."" Reg Green in the Alps with Eleanor and Nicholas In fact, Nicholas had been shot in the head although his sister Eleanor was sleeping peacefully. Seconds later, the driver's window was blown in too and the other car drove off. ""I stopped the car and got out. The interior light came on but Nicholas didn't move. I looked closer and saw his tongue was sticking out slightly and there was a trace of vomit on his chin,"" says Green, 88, whose book about the experience, The Nicholas Effect, formed the basis for the 1998 film starring Jamie Lee Curtis and Alan Bates, Nicholas' Gift. ""For the first time we realised something terrible had happened. The shock of seeing him like that was the bleakest moment I've ever had."" An American family's holiday had turned into a nightmare. Nicholas died in hospital days later, after entering a coma. But before he did, his parents made a decision which would change the lives of seven families across Italy - they decided to donate his organs. ""At that point, these people were just abstractions. You had no idea what kind of people they were. It was like giving money to charity but you've no idea how it helps. Four months afterwards, we were invited to go back and meet them all in Sicily, where four of the recipients are from,"" says Green. Back row left to right: Reg Green, Maggie Green, Andrea Mongiardo, Francesco Mondello, Tino Motta, Anna Maria Di Ceglie, Eleanor Green. Seated: Laura Green, Maria Pia Pedala, Domenica Galleta, Silvia Ciampi, Martin Green Andrea Mongiardo: Heart, died in 2017 Francesco Mondello: Cornea Tino Motta: Kidney Anna Maria Di Ceglie: Kidney Maria Pia Pedala: Liver Domenica Galleta: Cornea Silvia Ciampi: Pancreas, presumed to have died several years ago Criminals in Italy rarely kill children, Green says, because it makes the police so determined to catch the killers. This is what happened in Nicholas's case. A no-holds-barred police investigation resulted in the arrest and conviction of two men, Francesco Mesiano and Michele Iannello. It's still unclear whether the men were robbers, or hitmen who attacked the wrong car in a case of mistaken identity, but the fact that one of them employs one of Italy's top lawyers suggests to Green that they have mafia connections. ""The killing of a seven-year-old American boy in a country where violent death is commonplace has plunged Italy into national soul-searching,"" the Times reported. Green says that the idea of an innocent child being shot while on holiday in the country made many Italians feel ashamed - and led them to embrace the idea of organ donation as a way of making amends. Andrea Mongiardo (centre left), who received Nicholas's heart, pictured in Milan in 1987 with his triplet cousins Marta, Valentina and Marco ""The work we have done to remind them of how much good could come out of this has had this quite astonishing effect which we couldn't possibly have foreseen. A country that was almost at the bottom for organ donation in Europe could immediately move almost to the top. No other country has tripled organ donation."" In 1993, the year before Nicholas was shot, 6.2 people per million donated an organ, while by 2006 the figure had reached 20 per million. During that period, in 1999, Italy moved to an opt-out system, where when someone dies it is presumed they are willing for their organs to be donated unless they have specified otherwise. France, Greece, Portugal and Spain also use an opt-out system, while the US and UK (with the exception of Wales) continue to operate an opt-in system. Nicholas Green square in Cassino is one of many places in Italy bearing the child's name In Italy, there are more than 120 places named in Nicholas's honour: 50squares and streets 27parks and gardens 27schools 16other monuments and installations, including a lemon tree, a bridge and an amphitheatre This garden in Turin also pays tribute to Reg's son ""Nicholas was a kindly boy who always looked for the best in things so, when you were with him, you always wanted to be your best,"" explains his father. ""I know that at seven years old he probably wouldn't have been able to comprehend but, I know, as he grew up this is just what he would have wanted us to do - there's no doubt about that. ""If the choice was between being angry at the people who did it and wanting to help somebody else as the first priority, he would have undoubtedly chosen helping somebody out."" Green, who worked as a journalist on Fleet Street for many years before moving to the US, says his son taught him a lot about tolerance. ""I'm impatient and when things go wrong, I get het up about it,"" he says. ""Nicholas had a calmness about it all and a forgivingness that made you want to be the same."" Reg recently met with Maria who, after recovering from liver failure, gave birth to a boy she named Nicholas Nothing could have prepared Green for the moment he came face-to-face with those people whose lives were saved by Nicholas's organs. ""When the doors opened and the six walked in, the effect was overwhelming,"" he says, noting that illness prevented one from being present. ""Some were smiling, some were tearful, others were bashful but they were all alive. Most of these people had been on the point of death. That's when it hit you for the first time, just how big a thing this was. ""There was also a sense of how the parents and grandparents would have been devastated. You got the feeling there were many more people involved whose lives would have been much poorer if we hadn't saved them."" Green and his wife Maggie, who married in April 1986, were keen to ensure that Eleanor did not grow up alone. They have since had twins, Laura and Martin, who will turn 21 in May.  What impact has the death of Green's son had on his life? ""There's a sadness that was never there before. I'm never completely happy any more,"" Green says. ""Even when I'm at my happiest, I think: 'Wouldn't it be better if Nicholas was here?'"" Nicholas pictured in Switzerland days before he was fatally shot Butl'effetto Nicholas- the Nicholas Effect - is a silver lining. ""I feel that every time there is a piece in the newspaper, TV or radio, there is going to be somebody in the audience who is going to have to make this decision. If they have never heard or thought about organ donation before, they are much more likely to say 'no'."" BBC - Earth - There are diseases hidden in ice, and they are waking up Prince Philip's (in)famous gaffes Green returns to Italy twice a year to raise awareness about organ donation. On his most recent visit he met Maria Pia Pedala, who had been in a coma from liver failure on the day Nicholas died, but quickly bounced back to health after receiving his liver. She married two years later, and two years after that gave birth to a baby boy - named Nicholas - who was followed in two years by a girl, Alessia. The three of them travelled from Sicily, where organ donation was almost unknown in 1994 Green says, to take part with him in a television programme in Milan. Green points out that even the recipient of Nicholas's heart, Andrea Mongiardo, who died earlier this year, had the organ three times longer than Nicholas himself did. But he sees his son's legacy extending far beyond the seven people who received Nicholas's organs. Because donation rates soared after Nicholas's death, he says, thousands of people are now alive who would otherwise have died.

South Korea's 'life or death' presidential election,"Moon Jae-in is the front-runner in the South Korean presidential election In a room in the National Assembly in Seoul on Wednesday, a group of defectors from North Korea made an impassioned plea to voters: Don't elect the man who has led the opinion polls. The fugitives from the North said the front-runner, Moon Jae-in, might put their lives at risk if he won the only true opinion poll - the actual election. The defectors' argument was that Mr Moon was closely involved in a previous left-of-centre government in Seoul which had closer ties with Pyongyang under what was known as the Sunshine Policy. In a joint statement, the defectors said they had ""escaped the slave-like life"" under the North Korean regime, and that the re-establishment of more contact with North Korea might mean a return of freer movement between the two halves of the peninsula - with dire consequences for them. ""If candidate Moon Jae-in is elected,"" their statement said, ""a team of North Korean assassins could frequently come to South Korea to kidnap or murder defectors.  This poses a life-threatening risk to us."" Their fears show that the election on 9 May is about much more than the mundane matters of economic policy which often dominate elections in democratic countries. In South Korea, elections are about bread and butter, but also about life and death, peace and war.  There is a bigger, global picture with consequences far beyond the divided peninsula. For many South Koreans, the economy remains the dominant issue but, outside the country, relations - or the lack of them - with Pyongyang dominate, particularly when the North Korean nuclear programme is advanced and there's a new brash president in the White House in Washington DC. Not that Mr Moon says he wants closer ties with Pyongyang. Rather, he is emphasising close ties with Washington, saying recently: ""I believe President [Donald] Trump is more reasonable than he is generally perceived. ""President Trump uses strong rhetoric towards North Korea but, during the election campaign, he also said he could talk over a burger with Kim Jong-un. I am for that kind of pragmatic approach to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue."" Early voting for the election began this week A president Moon would be unlikely to open direct talks with Kim Jong-un, but he would want a strong and equal role in policy rather than letting Washington call the shots. He is more likely to favour contact with North Korea rather than the severing of relations undertaken by the previous president of South Korea. His predecessor Park Geun-hye, for example, closed an industrial complex just inside North Korea where South Korean firms employed workers from the North.  A president Moon might re-open it. Professor John Delury of the Graduate School of International Studies at Yonsei University in Seoul told the BBC:  ""We know pretty clearly what the presumed front-runner, Moon Jae-in, would do. ""He's supported by people who think the South has to go up there to Pyongyang and actively work on improving inter-Korean relations.  If it's Moon who wins this election, South Korea really becomes a new player and could be much more forcefully a part of whatever problem or solution we see on North Korea."" The second in the race is harder to read. Ahn Cheol-soo is the candidate from the People's Party Ahn Cheol-soo is likely to be more conciliatory towards Pyongyang than the previous president, though he has been making tougher statements recently, perhaps to woo conservatives. Either would pose a dilemma for Washington, according to Prof Delury, because they both want to improve the relationship between Seoul and Pyongyang:  ""And that, of course, flies completely in the face of what the United States is pushing right now which is more sanctions and more pressure and getting China to cut off North Korea. ""So potentially there's a train-wreck here where you've got the Trump administration saying 'pressure, pressure, pressure' on North Korea and suddenly you have a new South Korean president saying 'that's not going to solve the problem - we need to talk to those guys, we need to improve the relationship'."" The anti-missile Thaad system has attracted criticism Despite that, neither candidate - and certainly not the main conservative candidate, Hong Joon-pyo - seems likely to tell the United States to pack up its anti-missile system and take it home. Thaad, as the system is called, is newly installed on a golf course in the south of the country. Mr Moon has voiced his opposition but whether he would remove it as president is uncertain. There is opposition to it, both from local people who feel they would be in the line of fire if North Korea attacked the system, and from people on the left who oppose the current hard line against Pyongyang. There is a generational divide in South Korean politics.  Younger people lack the memory of war - not surprisingly because fighting in the Korean War ended in 1953 - and they feel economic insecurity. Lee Chae-rin, a student at Yonsei University, told the BBC: ""Even though foreigners always ask if we feel the threat of North Korea, the younger generation do not really that much compared with the older generation."" For them economic issues are strong. One of the classmates, Kim Tae-yeon, said: ""South Korea has become much richer today but the experience of insecurity is different from that of our grandparents. ""Before, it was a problem of whether they could eat, and that was solved by economic growth.  But now we're in a state of economic stagnation and that makes us much more insecure. ""Our problem is not whether we can eat but whether we would lose our function in this society because we cannot find a job."" There is some anger, particularly when the country's former president and the head of Samsung are facing trial for alleged corruption. Former president Park Geun-hye was impeached over a corruption scandal One student, Song Seung-hyun, said: ""People just want someone who would kick over the table like Trump did in Washington.  A lot of these politicians and business elites were in it for themselves. ""It comes down to the youth - our generation - want someone who would kick over the table."" That sentiment may or may not be prevalent in any generation. The winner of the election is not likely to ""kick over the table"". They may well, though, want a thawing of relations with Pyongyang.
