UK adds Putin's former wife to sanctions list,"Lyudmila Ocheretnaya (L) and Alina Kabaeva The UK has imposed sanctions on Russian President Vladimir Putin's former wife and his alleged current girlfriend over the invasion of Ukraine. Lyudmila Ocheretnaya, who was married to the president until 2014, and former Olympic gymnast Alina Kabaeva, face UK travel bans and asset freezes. The UK has now placed more than 1,000 people on itsRussian sanctions list,external. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said Britain was ""tightening the vice"" on Mr Putin's ""inner circle"". The UK was ""exposing and targeting the shady network propping up Putin's luxury lifestyle"", she said, and would ""keep going with sanctions on all those aiding and abetting Putin's aggression until Ukraine prevails"". Ms Truss said sanctions against Russia should only be lifted when all of its troops had left Ukraine. Earlier,she told a meeting of G7 foreign ministers in Germany that allies should go ""further and faster""in supporting Ukraine's resistance. She said President Putin must face a defeat that prevents further aggression - but some analysts have warned this stance may make a political settlement harder. Earlier this month it was reported that the EU planned to sanction more Russian individuals, including Ms Kabaeva. Since Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February, thousands of civilians and combatants have been killed or injured, and some 14 million people have fled their homes, with more than six million seeking refuge abroad. War in Ukraine: live updates Since her divorce, Lyudmila Ocheretnaya has benefited from preferential business relationships with state-owned entities and exhibited significant unexplained wealth, the UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) says. She is a close associate of Mr Putin and obtains a financial or material benefit from this association, it adds. Ms Kabaeva is a former Russian MP and chair of the board of directors of the National Media Group, which is reportedly the largest private Russian media company, the FCDO says. Mr Putin and Ms Kabaeva at a ceremony in 2001 It notes that the National Media Group controls television stations including Channel One, which is already under sanctions. ""She is also rumoured to be the current partner of Putin and it is reported that he has tried to reduce her visibility since the invasion began,"" the FCDO says. ""For example, a couple of weeks after the invasion, the National Media Group website was updated to remove her name, along with any reference to the board of directors."" Russia's leader has explicitly denied having a relationship with Ms Kabaeva. Who is Putin's alleged girlfriend? Amongothers added to the UK sanctions list,externalare Ms Kabaeva's grandmother, Anna Zatseplina, and cousins of Mr Putin. An asset freeze prevents any UK citizen, or any business in the UK, from dealing with any funds or economic resources which are owned, held or controlled by the designated person. A travel ban means the designated person must be refused leave to enter or to remain in the UK. The UK foreign secretary has been among the most outspoken of UK ministers in setting out explicit aims relating to the conflict, saying in a speech last month that Russia should bepushed out of ""the whole of Ukraine"". Some foreign policy analysts have raised concerns that such specific demands might one day clash with Ukraine's interests and could make negotiations harder. What is Nato and how do you join? Hard to see a way back for Putin, says PM Push Russia out of whole of Ukraine, says Truss Ukrainian and Moldovan foreign ministers are expected to join G7 ministers at another meeting in Germany on Friday. On Saturday, Ms Truss is due to travel to Berlin for a meeting of Nato foreign ministers, where the FCDO says she will push for a ""strengthened and modernised"" version of the western alliance.

"My body can't continue, says Deborah James","Ms James investigated how the NHS managed cancer care during the pandemic for BBC Panorama Podcast host Deborah James has said she is receiving hospice-at-home care for her bowel cancer and ""nobody knows how long I've got left"". The 40-year-old presenter of the BBC's You, Me and the Big C said she has had a ""heart-breaking"" six months but is ""surrounded by love"". ""My body just can't continue anymore,""she said in a post on Instagram,external. James was diagnosed in 2016 and kept her thousands of followers updated with candid accounts of her treatment. The former deputy head teacher said a Bowelbabe Fund - named after her online handle - was being set up to fund research into personalised medicine for cancer patients, and to support campaigns to raise awareness of bowel cancer. Since going live on Monday evening, the fund has already raised over Â£1m. James told her Instagram followers she was ""utterly blown away"" by the response to her appeal. She wrote: ""I never in my wildest dreams thought we'd be waking up to this total 12 hours later. I'm actually crying!"" In December, the mother-of-two reflected on the five years that had passed since she was told she had incurable cancer, saying: ""I'm fully aware I shouldn't be alive to write this today."" But in a new post on her Instagram page, @bowelbabe, she said she had to deliver ""the message I never wanted to write"". BBC presenter Rachael Bland dies aged 40 Rachael Bland 'changed my life' Big C podcast presenter 'in cancer-free place' James said her cancer was no longer being actively treated and instead the focus was on ensuring she was not in pain - allowing her to spend time with her ""incredible family"", who were all around her. ""Nobody knows how long I've got left but I'm not able to walk, I'm sleeping most of the days, and most things I took for granted are pipe dreams,"" she said. ""I know we have left no stone unturned. But even with all the innovative cancer drugs in the world or some magic new breakthrough, my body just can't continue anymore."" This video can not be played Watch: Deborah James speaks about her diagnosis to raise awareness (May 2019) The presenter was told she was free of cancer in January 2020, with doctors telling her they could ""find no evidence of active disease"", but it returned later the same year. Writing in her column in the Sun newspaper in December 2020, she said: ""I can never relax. I've been blindsided by my cancer too many times for that. I can never feel secure, and that comes with so many challenges. I never really feel at peace with it, and I don't think I ever will."" James began co-presenting You, Me and the Big C alongside Lauren Mahon and BBC Radio 5 Live newsreader Rachael Bland in 2018, with the show earning praise for its frank discussion of cancer. They spoke to celebrity guests and addressed practical matters including hair loss, tips for dealing with finances and telling your nearest and dearest. Bland died at the age of 40 six months after the show launched. She had been diagnosed with breast cancer two years earlier. Her husband, Steve Bland, took her place on the podcast after she died. Congratulating James on her fundraiser, Bland wrote on Instagram: ""Just so so so proud of this wonderful, inspirational woman that I get to call one of my best friends."" Bland said the change in James's condition was ""absolutely heartbreaking"" but that he would continue to focus on ""all the amazing things"" she was doing. ""She's still changing lives and she's still creating this incredible legacy so we've still got her, so we'll focus on that,"" he told the BBC. If you have been affected by any of these issues in this story you can visitBBC Action Line. James has been praised for her no-nonsense approach to talking about cancer, and she has shared her experiences of treatment and daily life with her social media followers since her diagnosis. She has worked to remove the embarrassment factor from bowel cancer, and even shared a video of herself walking down the street dressed as a poo emoji to encourage people to watch out for changes to their bowel movements. Genevieve Edwards, chief executive of the charity Bowel Cancer UK (of which James is a patron), said the number of lives that the podcaster has saved and will continue to save with her awareness and fundraising was ""nothing short of incredible"". She told the BBC: ""We're all desperately, desperately sad to have this news and our hearts are with Deborah and her family at this time."" Stacey Heale, 42, was put in touch with James by the charity after her husband Greg was diagnosed with bowel cancer in the same week as the presenter. She says: ""I was young. I was 36 when he was diagnosed. We'd just had two babies. And I was like, 'Who on earth do I talk to?'"" Stacey Heale's husband Greg was diagnosed with bowel cancer in the same week as Deborah James The mother-of-two says she and James began exchanging emails about Greg's treatment and became friends. ""What she's so good at is showing people how tolivewith cancer,"" she says. ""That was always her thing. It was always about living."" Ms Heale's husband later died on James's 40th birthday and Ms Heale sent James a message on the day urging her to keep enjoying life. ""I just said to her: 'Keep living, keep having fun.'""

Roberts had surgery for bowel cancer six months ago. She is now on her final cycle of chemotherapy and has returned to the station's weekend breakfast show. In her Instagram post on Monday, James said: ""Right now for me it's all about taking it a day at a time, step by step and being grateful for another sunrise. ""My whole family are around me and we will dance through this together, sunbathing and laughing (I'll cry!!) at every possible moment!"" She thanked her online followers for ""playing your part in my journey"", before signing off with the words: ""No regrets. Enjoy life x"" In the most recent episode of You, Me and the Big C, released in March, James spoke about how her illness has affected her mental health, and what it has been like for her two school-aged children. James explained her son and daughter had accessed counselling through their schools but had now paused sessions. ""In true fashion of my children, they went to their first session, went to their second session, I think, and then Eloise was like: 'Mummy, I just wanna play hockey' and Hugo hasn't turned up again,"" she said. ""They know the door's open. I now feel reassured that there is support if they want it.""

Deborah James made a dame by William at her homeThe BBC podcaster also revealed her bowel cancer charity fund has now raised more than Â£5m.UK,"Podcaster Deborah James has had her damehood conferred by Prince William at her family home. The 40-year-oldhost of the BBC's You, Me and the Big Csaid on Instagram she was ""utterly honoured"" he had joined her for afternoon tea and champagne. She said the visit was ""surreal"" and the prince was ""clearly passionate"" about improving oncology outcomes. The mother-of-two has raised more than Â£5m since revealing she is receiving end-of-life care for her bowel cancer. In an earlier Instagram post, Dame Deborah said she was ""completely lost for words"" after reaching the milestone amount. She had only launched the Bowelbabe fund - to pay for research into personalised medicine for cancer patients and to support campaigns to raise awareness of bowel cancer, on Monday - with an initial goal of Â£250,000. It came after she revealed she did not know how long she had left to live after stopping treatment and moving to hospice-at-home care. Dame Deborah is spending her remaining time with her family at her parents' home. William and Kate praise for Big C's Deborah James All I want is more life, says Big C's Deborah James My body can't continue, says Big C's Deborah James In her latest Instagram post, the former deputy headteacher wrote: ""Prince William actually came to our family house today!! I am utterly honoured that he joined us for afternoon tea and champagne, where he not only spent a generous amount of time talking to my whole family but also honoured me with my Damehood. She added: ""It's quite surreal having a royal pop in at home, and yes you can imagine the cleaning antics and preparation went off the scale - but it was all irrelevant because William was so kind and he put us all at ease. ""He is clearly passionate about improving oncology outcomes as the President of the Royal Marsden. It was such a special day for my whole family, making memories to last a life time. He's welcome back any time!"" A sunny day meant Dame Deborah and her family could take some cherished photos of the royal visit in the garden of her parents' home, where she is currently staying. Dame Deborah revealed the visit by the Duke of Cambridge became a champagne occasion for her family. Damehoods and knighthoods are usually announced as part of the New Year Honours or the Queen's Birthday Honours. But, in exceptional circumstances, some are announced at other times of the year - as happened with NHS fundraiser Captain Sir Tom Moore's knighthood. The visit by the duke was arranged similarly quickly, as he had just returned from a two-day visit to the west of Scotland with his wife Catherine. Dame Deborah has received widespread praise for her no-nonsense approach to talking about her cancer publicly, and has shared her experiences of treatment and daily life with her social media followers since her diagnosis in 2016. William and Catherine - who donated to Dame Deborah's research fund - said earlier this week that her ""tireless efforts"" in raising awareness of cancer were inspirational, and thanked her for ""giving hope"" to those living with the disease. Dame Deborah began co-presenting You, Me and the Big C alongside Lauren Mahon and BBC Radio 5 Live newsreader Rachael Bland in 2018, with the show earning praise for its frank discussion of cancer. They spoke to celebrity guests and addressed practical matters, including hair loss, tips for dealing with finances and telling your nearest and dearest about illnesses.

Violence at funeral for Al Jazeera reporter,"This video can not be played WATCH: Violent scenes at the funeral of Shireen Abu Aqla Israeli police have hit mourners at the funeral of Al Jazeera reporter Shireen Abu Aqla, whose killing in the occupied West Bank has caused a surge of anger. Her coffin almost fell as police, some using batons, waded into a crowd of Palestinians gathered around it. Police said they acted after being pelted with stones. Abu Aqla was shot dead in disputed circumstances on Wednesday, with Israel and Palestinians trading blame. The killing has been widely condemned. Footage showed a standoff between police and Palestinians gathered around the coffin in the hospital compound, before officers push the crowd back, with some beating and kicking mourners. Police said officers ""were forced to use riot dispersal means"". We were in the car park of St Joseph's hospital, where hundreds of Palestinian mourners had gathered ready for Shireen Abu Aqla's coffin to be carried out into a waiting hearse. There was a shrine of written tributes, a floral crucifix (Shireen was a Palestinian Christian) and poignantly a press flak jacket among the flowers. Many were in tears. There was some chanting and Palestinian flags were being flown. Suddenly the gates to the compound were closed and heavily armed Israeli border police, some on horseback, appeared on the other side of them. Given the circumstances it already felt confrontational. The coffin was brought out of the building carried by a group of pallbearers. While the plan was for the procession to the church to use the hearse, the coffin was now being carried towards the closed gates. What happened next was extraordinary. I was behind the packed crowd so I couldn't see the front point of contact, but the Israeli police suddenly pushed back the crowd, including the coffin and its carriers. They fired stun grenades towards the mourners and the press and were storming into the compound. From my vantage point - not at the front of the crowd - I saw a couple of plastic bottles being thrown back, nothing more. People ran to take cover inside the hospital. I saw a woman with a young baby in a carrier sling distraught, almost being crushed in the panic. The echo of stun grenades rang out in the hospital corridors and wards. I saw at least one man wounded. This seemed to go on for around 10 minutes, as we sought a safe route back towards the car park. After we came out, the coffin left in the hearse through the gates. And now videos have emerged showing what happened while people were rushing inside - Israeli police beating and kicking the pallbearers, who were in retreat carrying Shireen Abu Aqla's coffin. At one stage it nearly slipped from their grasp, falling towards the ground. A spokesman for UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said he was ""deeply disturbed"" by the confrontations between Israeli security forces and Palestinians and the behaviour of some police. White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki also said the images of police hitting mourners were disturbing. ""We regret the intrusion into what should have been a peaceful procession,"" she said. The Palestinian Authority and Al Jazeera claim Abu Aqla was shot dead by Israeli forces, while Israel said it was not yet possible to determine what happened and that she could have been killed by Palestinian gunfire. An Israeli military interim report on Thursday said the fatal shot could have come from ""massive fire from Palestinian gunmen"", or possibly from ""a few bullets"" fired by a soldier ""at a terrorist who was firing at his vehicle"". Sherine Abu Aqla was known to millions for her coverage of the Israel-Palestinian conflict Shireen Abu Aqla, a 51-year-old Palestinian American, was a veteran correspondent for Al Jazeera's Arabic news channel and had reported on the Israel-Palestinian conflict for two decades. Shireen Abu Aqla: Face and voice of war and peace She was given the rarity of a funeral at the compound of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas on Thursday, where her coffin was brought draped in the Palestinian flag. President Abbas paid tribute to her, describing her as a ""martyr of the free word"" who ""sacrificed her life"" to defend the Palestinian cause. He said Israel was ""fully responsible for her killing"" and that he would refer the case to the International Criminal Court, which investigates potential war crimes. Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett has accused Mr Abbas of ""throwing blame at Israel without any basis"". Abu Aqla was in the Jenin refugee camp early on Wednesday to report on the Israeli raid. The Israeli military said the operation was to apprehend ""terrorist suspects"". It said: ""Tens of Palestinian gunmen fired at and hurled explosive devices toward the soldiers. The soldiers responded with fire toward the gunmen and hits were identified."" Another Palestinian journalist, Al Jazeera producer Ali Samoudi, was shot and wounded during the violence. The incident comes at a time of particularly high tension between Israel and the Palestinians, after nearly two months of one of the deadliest periods of violence in years. Israel has carried out operations in Jenin in the wake of a wave of killings of Israeli Jews by Palestinians and Israeli Arabs in Israel and the West Bank. Seventeen Israelis and two Ukrainians have been killed in stabbings, shootings, car rammings and an axe attack. In the same period, dozens of Palestinians have been killed - including assailants shot dead while carrying out attacks, or militants and civilians killed during Israeli raids and confrontations. Four of the Palestinians who carried out attacks in Israel came from the Jenin district. An Israeli police commando meanwhile was killed on Friday during clashes with Palestinian gunmen near Jenin, police said. The commando, who was 47, was shot dead during an operation to arrest a suspect, Israeli authorities said. Doucet: Killed journalist 'inspiration' to a generation.

Mao Zedong scroll thieves jailed in Hong Kong,"Three people have been jailed in Hong Kong for stealing art said to be worth millions, including a calligraphy scroll written by former Chinese communist leader Mao Zedong. The thieves had been unaware of its value and sold it to an amateur collector for under HK$200 ($25; Â£20). The buyer himself didn't know the worth of the calligraphy and cut it in half so it could be more easily stored. The defendants were each jailed for up to two and a half years. The handwritten scroll contains details of a Chinese Communist Party meeting and several stanzas of Mao's poetry. Its owner has claimed it is estimated to be worth around $300m (Â£230m), though it is not known how the valuation was obtained. The scroll was stolen in a massive heist in September 2020, when three men broke into the home of Fu Chunxiao, a well-known collector of stamps and revolutionary art. They also made off with antique stamps, copper coins and other pieces of calligraphy by Mao. The total haul was worth HK$5bn ($645m; Â£500m) according to Mr Fu, who was reportedly in mainland China when the burglary took place. A buyer then saw a public appeal by police, and surrendered himself with both pieces of the scroll. Ho Yik-chiu, 46, Ng Wing-lun, 45, and Hui Ping-kei, 48, all pleaded guilty, according to The South China Morning Post. The court heard how the three men were seasoned burglars who had deliberately targeted Mr Fu's apartment while he was overseas. Much of the haul is still missing. In 2019, a calligraphic autograph letter written by Mao Zedong wasauctioned off by Sotheby's for Â£519,000.,external.

Prime minister to visit NI as DUP blocks assembly,"Boris Johnson will visit Northern Ireland on Monday amid a power-sharing crisis sparked by rising tensions over post-Brexit trading arrangements, Sinn FÃ©in's Michelle O'Neill has said. It comes as the DUP blocked the election of a Speaker to a new assembly on Friday, meaning it cannot function. The DUP said its actions sent a ""clear message"" about its opposition to the NI Protocol. Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said the PM must ""outline what he intends to do"". Mr Johnson's visit coincides with increased speculation that the government is poised to introduce legislation to strip away parts of the Northern Ireland Protocol. The Democratic Unionist Party's move to block the election of a Speaker follows the assembly election on 5 May. The Northern Ireland Protocol, a part of the UK-EU Brexit deal which keeps Northern Ireland aligned with the EU single market for goods, places a trade border in the Irish Sea between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The protocol - now under fresh scrutiny following the election - was designed to ensure free trade could continue across the Irish land border, but it has been opposed by unionist politicians. Follow live: MLAs gather to elect Assembly Speaker What is the Northern Ireland Protocol? Last week's vote cemented a majority for assembly members who accept the protocol, including the new largest party, the republican party Sinn FÃ©in. Most politicians elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly want the protocol to remain Its vice-president, Michelle O'Neill, who is entitled to be Northern Ireland's next first minister, said the DUP had failed on day one of the new assembly. ""There is no reason why we should be in a rolling crisis for even one second,"" Ms O'Neill told the chamber. Speaking to press in the Great Hall following the sitting, Ms O'Neill claimed that the DUP had ""punished the public"" for its own selfish interest. ""That isn't tolerable, it isn't acceptable , it isn't good enough"", she added. The UK government has said itwants to override parts of the treaty it signed in 2020, but Sir Jeffrey said it would ""not be words that determine how we [the DUP] proceed, it will be actions"". The DUP, now the second-largest party by seats, said it would not nominate ministers to Stormont's governing executive until its concerns about the protocol were resolved. Its decision to also not elect a Speaker - a move which requires cross community support - means that there can be no debates in the assembly, no committees can be held, and the actions of ministers, currently acting in a caretaker capacity, cannot be scrutinised. The Northern Ireland Executive cannot meet without a first and deputy first minister as the roles are joint and one cannot exist without the other. The executive collapsed in February when the DUP First Minister Paul Givan resigned in protest over the protocol, meaning the deputy first minister had to leave their post as well. Other ministers who were in office at that time can continue in a caretaker fashion but their powers are limited. This video can not be played 'We can proceed no further without a Speaker' - Maskey Mr Givan told MLAs on Friday that his party was respecting its mandate to ""remove the Irish Sea border"". ""Our message is now clear - it is time for action, words will no longer suffice,"" he said. Mr Givan added that his party had been patient and reasonable in its demands for progress in the UK-EU talks on the protocol. Earlier, Sir Jeffrey said his party needed to ""send a very clear message to the European Union and to our government that we are serious about getting this protocol sorted out"". ""Because of the harm it is doing, undermining political stability, damaging agreements, harming our economy, contributing to the cost of living crisis, this matter needs to be dealt with,"" he added. Sir Jeffrey has argued the protocol has eroded the foundations ""devolution has been built upon"" and undermined Northern Ireland's position in the UK. DUP threatens to stop assembly functioning What do voters think of the NI Protocol? UK rejects EU plans to deal with NI Protocol A simple guide to the Brexit border problem How PM's views on Northern Ireland deal changed Without a Speaker we have a ""silent assembly"". It was one of the few moves left open to the DUP to try and apply pressure. In other words, the party is saying to London and Brussels you can have the protocol or Stormont - but you can't have both. This is a big gamble for the DUP in the hope there will be movement on the protocol to allow the party to return to Stormont. What if there is no change? How long will the party stay away from the assembly and the executive? How will the public react? What of the fact that a majority of MLAs support the protocol and does this look like the DUP are holding people to ransom? This is the DUP moving things up a gear. Read morehere. NI Secretary Brandon Lewis said he was disappointed by the DUP's move, tweeting that Northern Ireland deserved a stable and accountable devolved government. Ms O'Neill said that when she meets Mr Johnson on Monday, she will tell him ""that he needs to stop pandering to the DUP, that they need to get on and work with the [European] Commission and find ways to smooth the implementation of the protocol and stop holding us to ransom for their game playing"". Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) MicheÃ¡l Martin said the EU had been flexible in its approach to the negotiations with the UK government, but this had not been reciprocated. ""There are issues that unionism have raised with us in respect of the protocol, but those issues should not prevent the establishment of the assembly,"" he added. Alliance Party leader Naomi Long said parties who believe in devolution ""do not gamble with it"". ""Many of us in this chamber represent people who did not consent to Brexit in the first place and yet we turned up for work,"" she said. Mrs Long later said it was a ""shameful day"" for the DUP. ""The DUP came to Stormont, signed the register, took their salaries but refused to take their seats and do the work to earn it,"" she said. Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader Doug Beattie said without a functioning assembly there would be ""silence"" as people deal with the cost of living crisis and die on hospital waiting lists. ""People will be desperately calling for an ambulance and from this place there will be silence,"" he said. Matthew O'Toole, of the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP), accused the DUP of having ""thwarted and demeaned"" democracy. However, Jim Allister, the Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) leader, said the protocol was causing ""pain"" and it was not the right time to appoint a Speaker. Meanwhile, Sinn FÃ©in's John O'Dowd will become the new infrastructure minister. He will replace Nichola Mallon of the SDLP after she failed to gain re-election to the assembly last week.

Coleen Rooney: My online post was a last resort,"Mrs Rooney said she posted warnings online ""many times"" from 2017 but personal story leaks ""didn't stop"" Coleen Rooney has told the High Court her online post alleging Rebekah Vardy leaked private stories about her to the Sun newspaper was a ""last resort"". Mrs Rooney appeared in the witness box for the first time on day four of the libel case, brought by Mrs Vardy. She told the court on Friday she was ""surprised"" by ""how much interest"" her so-called Wagatha Christie social media post caused in 2019. And that it was never her ""intention"" for Mrs Vardy to receive abuse. ""It's not in my nature to cause abuse or trolling in any way at all,"" she said. Mrs Rooney is being sued for libel by Mrs Vardy, for alleging she leaked personal stories to the Sun newspaper, which she denies. The case was sparked bya viral social media post,externalfrom October 2019, in which Mrs Rooney said she had carried out a sting operation to find out who had been passing private information about her life to the Sun. She said the fake stories she had posted on Instagram in an effort to find the perpetrator had only been viewed by ""Rebekah Vardy's account"". Rebekah Vardy arriving at court on Friday Mrs Vardy's barrister, Hugh Tomlinson, asked Mrs Rooney what she set out to achieve with the widely-shared post. She replied: ""I wasn't achieving anything, what I wanted was to stop the person who was leaking my private information to The Sun"". Adding that stories, ""no matter how big or small"", about her family had been ""picked up by the media for 20 years"". Mrs Rooney said she had posted warnings online ""many times"" from 2017 but that personal story leaks ""didn't stop"". Private Instagram posts were leaked, she said, at a time when ""I didn't know how my marriage was going to work out and whether I was going on with my relationship."" She noted how Mrs Vardy, whose husband Jamie played football for England with her own husband Wayne, was ""not in my circle"" and they had ""never met socially"". The 36-year-old said that whenever her own name appeared in the press, it was ""a regular occurrence"" that she would then be messaged by Mrs Vardy, 40. ""I felt like when she contacted me it was to try and get information out of me,"" Mrs Rooney said. She told the court that Mrs Vardy's messages were ""generally nice"", but added that ""towards the end it was a bit unusual"" that ""someone who was not that close to me [would be] constantly checking in with me all the time"". Mrs Rooney said in her written witness statement that seeing a message between Mrs Vardy and her agent referencing her late sister ""knocked me sick"" when it was disclosed. The defendant stressed she had never fallen out with any of the other partners of her husband's teammates. Wayne Rooney looked away as his wife Coleen told the court how leaked stories had added to their marriage issues When asked if she might have tried to mitigate any online abuse suffered by Mrs Vardy with another social media post, she replied: ""Maybe I would have liked to have [done so]"", but with little knowledge of the legal system she decided to follow ""instruction of my legal team"". In her statement, Mrs Rooney also said she had tried ""in vain"" to bring the matter to a close before it had made it to court. ""I have sought to resolve this matter amicably on various occasions because I was of the view that the time, money, resources and efforts involved could be better spent elsewhere, particularly in light of the Covid-19 pandemic,"" she stated. She added she had ""no doubt that this litigation, whatever the outcome, will benefit neither Becky [Mrs Vardy] nor myself"". Mrs Rooney and Mrs Vardy pictured here watching their partners at Euro 2016 in France Earlier on Friday, under re-examination from her own barrister, Mrs Vardy broke down in tears once again, as she had done on the two previous days. She said she felt like she had been ""bullied and manipulated"" while facing an ""exhausting"" and ""intimidating"" cross examination by Mrs Rooney's barrister David Sherborne; and stated that she had pressed on with legal action despite a letter from Mrs Rooney's solicitors which she perceived as a ""threat"" because she ""didn't do anything wrong"". Mrs Vardy said she had discussed Mrs Rooney's private Instagram account only ""a handful of times"" with her agent agent Caroline Watt, who she confirmed was first given the password to her account when she went into the celebrity jungle on the ITV show I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! in 2017. The court heard Mrs Rooney had been left ""fuming"" about a Sun article in January 2019 about her allegedly being involved in a car crash while she and husband were living in the US, having previously posted on Instagram about damage to her vehicle. Mrs Rooney was alerted to the story by one of her son's football coaches, who was concerned about them, but, the court heard: ""There was no crash."" The Liverpudlian explained that a lorry had ""scraped down the side of the car"", likely due to the fact she was unused to driving on the right side of the road in the US. Mrs Rooney said she was ""angry"" and ""annoyed"" when the Sun printed information which ""was untrue"" and the private information was ""getting out there"". Hear more on the BBC Sounds podcast It's... Wagatha Christie Mrs Vardy's barrister suggested to Mrs Rooney that she had ""no evidence"" to link his client to alleged leaks. ""I believe that Mrs Vardy knew that this was happening, whether it was Mrs Vardy herself or it was someone she's given permission to,"" she responded. Mr Tomlinson replied: ""You might believe that Derby County [the team Mr Rooney currently manages] will win the Premiership. It's not evidence that they are going to."" On Thursday,Mrs Vardy appeared to accept that her agent had leaked informationto the Sun. Mrs Rooney, who described herself as a full-time mum in her witness statement, said at one stage: ""I'm not a gossip, I don't like to confirm things unless they are true,"" later adding that she hadn't picked Mrs Vardy's name ""out of thin air"" during her own personal investigation. The trial continues next week.

Eurovision final: Seven things to watch out for,"Norway's Subwoolfer have been a huge hit with fans The Eurovision Song Contest reaches its grand final on Saturday night in Turin, with Ukraine, Italy and the UK among the favourites to win. Yes, I said the UK. No, I don't believe it either. But here we are. Sam Ryder, a construction worker turned TikTok star, wowed people so much during rehearsals that bookmakers have been shortening his odds of winning all week. Now, I know what you're going to say: ""But surely Eurovision is all about politics"". And to an extent, you're right. Countries often trade votes with their neighbours. If Greece and Cyprus don't award each other ""douze points"", it would probably provoke a diplomatic incident. But several studies -here's the most recent one,external- show that political voting rarely affects the overall winner. In order to get enough points, you need a broad range of support that's impossible to achieve through favouritism alone. Political votes definitely affect the mid-table results, however, while the last-place positions are reserved for the worst songs. Sam Ryder is hoping to earn the UK its best result in decades Ukraine's rap-folk crossover band Kalush Orchestra were among the favourites even before Russia invaded their country This year, of course, politics are expected to dictate the outcome. Ukraine are the presumptive favourites, as public sympathy soars after Russia's invasion. But some observers are wary even of that suggestion. Is a 17-year-old in Tallinn really considering Vladimir Putin's geopolitical ambitions when they pick up the phone to cast a vote in a song contest, or are they thinking: ""That boy from Belgium looks hot""? Decades of pop history suggest it's the latter. The Eurovision anthem born in a war zone Ireland fail to make Eurovision Song Contest final Sam Ryder is 'ignoring the hype' at Eurovision When a president tried to intervene in Eurovision... Who will win Eurovision? And other questions answered Anyway, the joy of Eurovision isn't about analysing the intricacies of the voting system. It's about revelling in the strange, beautiful, passionate and peculiar performances that the continent (and Australia) puts forward. So here's a quick preview of the moments you should look out for when the Grand Final kicks off on BBC One on Saturday evening. Allow YouTube content?

Norway's Subwoolfer are the oldest act ever to take the Eurovision stage, having formed 4.5 billion years ago on the moon before coming to Earth to dominate pop music. Or so the story goes. Known as Keith and Jim, they hide their identity behind custard yellow masks, and put a modern spin on the Red Riding Hood story over a thumping house beat. ""Before that wolf eats my grandma, give that wolf a banana"", they advise. An ap-peel-ing cross betweenHollaback Girl,externalandWhat Does The Fox Say,external, this one has a British connection, too. One of the wolves is rumoured to be Ben Adams from the 90s boyband A1.... and we spotted his wife outside the Norwegian delegation's hotel on Thursday, so it must be true. Serbia's Konstrakta gives viewers a lesson in good hygiene Serbia's In Corpore Sano is a  song that was clearly written during the pandemic by someone falling down a WebMD rabbit hole in the middle of a nervous breakdown. An ode to personal hygiene, it poses the eternal question: ""What's the secret behind Meghan Markle's healthy hair? I think that deep hydration is what it is"", before spiralling into a feverish examination of personal hygiene, and whether ""dark circles around the eyes indicate liver problems"". You imagine the singer Konstrakta (aka Ana Duric) scrawling these lyrics obsessively on her wall during a particularly dark night of the soul - an image that's only reinforced when she's joined onstage by a choir intoning in Latin. In case that wasn't strange enough, she spends the entire performance washing her hands in a tiny basin. Naturally, it's a favourite among fans in the arena. MÃ¥neskin celebrated their victory in style last year Italian rock band MÃ¥neskin roared into first place at last year's Eurovision with their glam-thrash song Zitti E Buoni, and went on to become a genuine global phenomenon, touring with the Rolling Stones, winning an MTV Award and scoring a billion streams of their hit single, Beggin'. ""How many nights did I spend in my own bed last year? Maybe 10,"" laughs bassist Victoria De Angelis. The quartet will return to the Eurovision stage on Saturday night to play their new single, Supermodel, which was inspired by ""fake people"" they encountered in LA last year. ""I know it's not our deepest song, but it's good,"" says frontman Damiano David. Fans will notice he's a little less mobile than normal, after tearing his ankle shooting a music video. But the band are ready to reclaim the stage that brought them to an international audience. ""I don't know if I'm going to be able to run around, but I'm just going to enjoynotbeing in the competition,"" says David. Spain's Chanel is an established star of stage musicals Under different circumstances, Cuban-Spanish singer Chanel wouldn't be part of the contest. Two years ago, she was one of five actresses on the shortlist to play Anita in Steven Spielberg's remake of West Side Story. The role eventually went to Ariana deBose, but cinema's loss is Eurovision's gain. Chanel's slinky pop song, SloMo, was originally written for Jennifer Lopez, and it has a dance routine worthy of La Lopez herself. To ensure she could carry out the choreography without losing her breath, Chanel trained for Eurovision by singing while running on a treadmill. After three days, she decided the challenge wasn't enough, and started running in heels. Now that's dedication. Mahmood and Blanco are huge stars in Italy This year's contest has spawned a lot of copycat MÃ¥neskins - most of whom were thrown out in the semi-finals - but Italy has gone in the opposite direction. Their entry comes from Mahmood, a runner-up in 2019, who's teamed up with fellow Italian pop star Blanco for a big old ballad and, let me tell you, it's a spine-tingler. Brividi (translated as ""chills"") is a song about how, in love, the fear of being inadequate is a universal experience - regardless of gender, identity or sexuality. ""I'd like to love you, but I'm always wrong"", the duo sing, with just the right blend of pathos and vulnerability, ""and I get chills, chills, chills"". On Spotify, it's currently the most-played song from this year's contest. That's not a guarantee of votes on Saturday night (what if all those plays come from Italians, who can't vote for their own act?) but it's a sign that Ukraine might not have the competition sewn up. If Italy do win, they'll be the first country to have back-to-back victories since Ireland's incredible hat-trick in the early 1990s. Sheldon Riley's costume had to be shipped in one piece, as it can't be dismantled Australia's Sheldon Riley wrote his song, Not The Same, years ago as a message to his younger self, about the struggles of dealing with Asperger's Syndrome and coming to terms with his sexuality in a deeply religious family. He says he's been singing it since he was 15 - but the message has changed from one of despair to hope, as he learned to be proud of his differences. The song's transformation is evident in the staging too. When he won Eurovision - Australia Decides earlier this year, he was dressed in black, surrounded by bleak, industrial sets. Now, he's all in white and bathed in light. And he can barely move. Sheldon's costume weighs 40kg - thanks to the 200,000 Swarovski crystals and 90,000 Swarovski pearls stitched into the fabric. Along with his mask and other accessories, the total weight is 51kg. Imagine his excess baggage charges. Stefan makes full use of the multi-pronged Eurovision stage Believe it or not, when Estonia's Stefan performs on Saturday night, he will only just have woken up. ""Usually, I go to sleep before I go on stage,"" he told Steve Holdenon the Official Eurovison podcast,external. ""I don't know why, but my body tells me, 'you need to rest' and I just go somewhere quiet and take a nap for 15 minutes, and then I wake up like a new person."" There's nothing sleepy about his performance, though, as Stefan bounds around the arena like a little puppy, even taking a daring leap over the stage's built-in waterfall. Let's just hope he remembers to set his alarm. Watch thefirst Eurovision Semi-FinalonBBC iPlayernow. Watch thesecond Eurovision Semi-FinalonBBC iPlayernow.

Where have we been going wrong with Eurovision?,"This video can not be played Amy Wadge co-wrote Space Man in a video call The UK hasn't taken Eurovision seriously but that is changing, a co-writer of this year's entry has said. Amy Wadge said although some think the UK's lack of success it due to politics, in reality not enough effort has been made. Sam Ryder will sing Space Man at this year's event hosted in Turin, Italy, The song was written over Zoom and Amy was initially ""sceptical"" about it being performed at Eurovision as Space Man is about to be seen by millions. On Thursday, the second semi-final took place to determine which 26 counties compete in Saturday's final. When a president tried to intervene in Eurovision... How Eurovision is bringing Europe together again Who will win Eurovision? Grammy Award winner Amy, who lives in Rhondda Cynon Taf, co-wrote Thinking Out Loud with Ed Sheeran and previously worked with artists such as Camila Cabello and Bonnie Tyler. She has been working with TikTok star Sam Ryder for 18 months and co-wrote Space Man with him and Max Wolfgang. This year, TikTok star Sam Ryder hopes to break the UK's losing streak ""My initial reaction was like, 'that's a bit of a curveball',"" said Amy. ""But I think that the UK has really embraced the opportunity and having 200 million people seeing a song is huge and I think that Sam is such a great ambassador for it because he truly loves the Eurovision songs. ""It is an amazing spectacle however you look at it, and I hope that at the very least, we've reconfigured people's thoughts [to think] 'let's go for it and let's enjoy it'."" She hopes Sam's ""infectious"" love for Eurovision will change the way people view the competition. She said it has been considered a ""bit of a joke"", but ""if you look back, the songs have been really great"". ""James Newman is a friend of mine,he wrote a great song last year, but there was not all the framework around it to elevate it. ""Actually back in the day with Katrina and the Waves, Michael Ball, etc all did very well because we understood we should throw our best at it."" The UK has taken part in 63 Eurovision contests since 1957. It has won the competition five times, including its last win in 1997. Critics have said the UK's lack of recent success is due to politics, but Eurovision organisers point out that judges sign a document agreeing to vote independently. James Newman's song Embers got ranked 11th and 13th out of 26 through jury points by Poland and the Czech Republic Amy believes that view is a bit ""paranoid"" and the quality of acts competing is always going to make it a challenge. ""There's some great artists with great songs and we as the UK just need to go and be proud of who we are and just be accepted,"" she said. In 2021, the UK received no points from the jury or the public - the same as in the previous final in 2019. In fact, the UK hasn't seen the top 10 since 2009 or even in the top half of the leader board since 2011. Bucks Fizz became 1980s stars after their 1981 Eurovision win However, it is not all doom and gloom when it comes to the UK's performance at Eurovision. In fact, some big names have come out of the other side, including winners Bucks Fizz in 1981 and Lulu in 1969. Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

Runners up have also seen success - have you ever heard of Sir Cliff Richard? Coming second in 1968, he has sold more than 250 million albums in his 50-year career. Amy said, despite working on the UK entry, she was ""rooting for Ukraine"" because of ""a really great song and what they are going through as a country"". Ukraine last won in 2016 but Kalush Orchestra are hoping for another win - pointing out they were the fifth favourites to win before the invasion After Turin at the weekend, Amy will be flying to LA but the songwriter to the stars said her home in the valleys was where she wants to be. ""I truly adore the people here and I'm in a fortunate position where I can think of what financially I can do to help."" As part of that thinking she's collaborated with Michael Ball OBE to write the song Million Lights for the charity 2wish. All proceeds will go to the Welsh child bereavement charity. ""For whatever reason over the last couple of years I have got to know people who have gone through child loss and I am affiliated with a couple of charitiesâ¦ as a mother you're going to feel some connection"".

Deborah James made a dame by William at her home,"Podcaster Deborah James has had her damehood conferred by Prince William at her family home. The 40-year-oldhost of the BBC's You, Me and the Big Csaid on Instagram she was ""utterly honoured"" he had joined her for afternoon tea and champagne. She said the visit was ""surreal"" and the prince was ""clearly passionate"" about improving oncology outcomes. The mother-of-two has raised more than Â£5m since revealing she is receiving end-of-life care for her bowel cancer. In an earlier Instagram post, Dame Deborah said she was ""completely lost for words"" after reaching the milestone amount. She had only launched the Bowelbabe fund - to pay for research into personalised medicine for cancer patients and to support campaigns to raise awareness of bowel cancer, on Monday - with an initial goal of Â£250,000. It came after she revealed she did not know how long she had left to live after stopping treatment and moving to hospice-at-home care. Dame Deborah is spending her remaining time with her family at her parents' home. William and Kate praise for Big C's Deborah James All I want is more life, says Big C's Deborah James My body can't continue, says Big C's Deborah James In her latest Instagram post, the former deputy headteacher wrote: ""Prince William actually came to our family house today!! I am utterly honoured that he joined us for afternoon tea and champagne, where he not only spent a generous amount of time talking to my whole family but also honoured me with my Damehood. She added: ""It's quite surreal having a royal pop in at home, and yes you can imagine the cleaning antics and preparation went off the scale - but it was all irrelevant because William was so kind and he put us all at ease. ""He is clearly passionate about improving oncology outcomes as the President of the Royal Marsden. It was such a special day for my whole family, making memories to last a life time. He's welcome back any time!"" A sunny day meant Dame Deborah and her family could take some cherished photos of the royal visit in the garden of her parents' home, where she is currently staying. Dame Deborah revealed the visit by the Duke of Cambridge became a champagne occasion for her family. Damehoods and knighthoods are usually announced as part of the New Year Honours or the Queen's Birthday Honours. But, in exceptional circumstances, some are announced at other times of the year - as happened with NHS fundraiser Captain Sir Tom Moore's knighthood. The visit by the duke was arranged similarly quickly, as he had just returned from a two-day visit to the west of Scotland with his wife Catherine. Dame Deborah has received widespread praise for her no-nonsense approach to talking about her cancer publicly, and has shared her experiences of treatment and daily life with her social media followers since her diagnosis in 2016. William and Catherine - who donated to Dame Deborah's research fund - said earlier this week that her ""tireless efforts"" in raising awareness of cancer were inspirational, and thanked her for ""giving hope"" to those living with the disease. Dame Deborah began co-presenting You, Me and the Big C alongside Lauren Mahon and BBC Radio 5 Live newsreader Rachael Bland in 2018, with the show earning praise for its frank discussion of cancer. They spoke to celebrity guests and addressed practical matters, including hair loss, tips for dealing with finances and telling your nearest and dearest about illnesses. Blanddied at the age of 40, six months after the show launched. She had been diagnosed with breast cancer two years earlier.

Eurovision 2022: Seven things to watch out for,"Norway's Subwoolfer have been a huge hit with fans The Eurovision Song Contest reaches its grand final on Saturday night in Turin, with Ukraine, Italy and the UK among the favourites to win. Yes, I said the UK. No, I don't believe it either. But here we are. Sam Ryder, a construction worker turned TikTok star, wowed people so much during rehearsals that bookmakers have been shortening his odds of winning all week. Now, I know what you're going to say: ""But surely Eurovision is all about politics"". And to an extent, you're right. Countries often trade votes with their neighbours. If Greece and Cyprus don't award each other ""douze points"", it would probably provoke a diplomatic incident. But several studies -here's the most recent one,external- show that political voting rarely affects the overall winner. In order to get enough points, you need a broad range of support that's impossible to achieve through favouritism alone. Political votes definitely affect the mid-table results, however, while the last-place positions are reserved for the worst songs. Sam Ryder is hoping to earn the UK its best result in decades Ukraine's rap-folk crossover band Kalush Orchestra were among the favourites even before Russia invaded their country This year, of course, politics are expected to dictate the outcome. Ukraine are the presumptive favourites, as public sympathy soars after Russia's invasion. But some observers are wary even of that suggestion. Is a 17-year-old in Tallinn really considering Vladimir Putin's geopolitical ambitions when they pick up the phone to cast a vote in a song contest, or are they thinking: ""That boy from Belgium looks hot""? Decades of pop history suggest it's the latter. The Eurovision anthem born in a war zone Ireland fail to make Eurovision Song Contest final Sam Ryder is 'ignoring the hype' at Eurovision When a president tried to intervene in Eurovision... Who will win Eurovision? And other questions answered Anyway, the joy of Eurovision isn't about analysing the intricacies of the voting system. It's about revelling in the strange, beautiful, passionate and peculiar performances that the continent (and Australia) puts forward. So here's a quick preview of the moments you should look out for when the Grand Final kicks off on BBC One on Saturday evening. Allow YouTube content?

Norway's Subwoolfer are the oldest act ever to take the Eurovision stage, having formed 4.5 billion years ago on the moon before coming to Earth to dominate pop music. Or so the story goes. Known as Keith and Jim, they hide their identity behind custard yellow masks, and put a modern spin on the Red Riding Hood story over a thumping house beat. ""Before that wolf eats my grandma, give that wolf a banana"", they advise. An ap-peel-ing cross betweenHollaback Girl,externalandWhat Does The Fox Say,external, this one has a British connection, too. One of the wolves is rumoured to be Ben Adams from the 90s boyband A1.... and we spotted his wife outside the Norwegian delegation's hotel on Thursday, so it must be true. Serbia's Konstrakta gives viewers a lesson in good hygiene Serbia's In Corpore Sano is a  song that was clearly written during the pandemic by someone falling down a WebMD rabbit hole in the middle of a nervous breakdown. An ode to personal hygiene, it poses the eternal question: ""What's the secret behind Meghan Markle's healthy hair? I think that deep hydration is what it is"", before spiralling into a feverish examination of personal hygiene, and whether ""dark circles around the eyes indicate liver problems"". You imagine the singer Konstrakta (aka Ana Duric) scrawling these lyrics obsessively on her wall during a particularly dark night of the soul - an image that's only reinforced when she's joined onstage by a choir intoning in Latin. In case that wasn't strange enough, she spends the entire performance washing her hands in a tiny basin. Naturally, it's a favourite among fans in the arena. MÃ¥neskin celebrated their victory in style last year Italian rock band MÃ¥neskin roared into first place at last year's Eurovision with their glam-thrash song Zitti E Buoni, and went on to become a genuine global phenomenon, touring with the Rolling Stones, winning an MTV Award and scoring a billion streams of their hit single, Beggin'. ""How many nights did I spend in my own bed last year? Maybe 10,"" laughs bassist Victoria De Angelis. The quartet will return to the Eurovision stage on Saturday night to play their new single, Supermodel, which was inspired by ""fake people"" they encountered in LA last year. ""I know it's not our deepest song, but it's good,"" says frontman Damiano David. Fans will notice he's a little less mobile than normal, after tearing his ankle shooting a music video. But the band are ready to reclaim the stage that brought them to an international audience. ""I don't know if I'm going to be able to run around, but I'm just going to enjoynotbeing in the competition,"" says David. Spain's Chanel is an established star of stage musicals Under different circumstances, Cuban-Spanish singer Chanel wouldn't be part of the contest. Two years ago, she was one of five actresses on the shortlist to play Anita in Steven Spielberg's remake of West Side Story. The role eventually went to Ariana deBose, but cinema's loss is Eurovision's gain. Chanel's slinky pop song, SloMo, was originally written for Jennifer Lopez, and it has a dance routine worthy of La Lopez herself. To ensure she could carry out the choreography without losing her breath, Chanel trained for Eurovision by singing while running on a treadmill. After three days, she decided the challenge wasn't enough, and started running in heels. Now that's dedication. Mahmood and Blanco are huge stars in Italy This year's contest has spawned a lot of copycat MÃ¥neskins - most of whom were thrown out in the semi-finals - but Italy has gone in the opposite direction. Their entry comes from Mahmood, a runner-up in 2019, who's teamed up with fellow Italian pop star Blanco for a big old ballad and, let me tell you, it's a spine-tingler. Brividi (translated as ""chills"") is a song about how, in love, the fear of being inadequate is a universal experience - regardless of gender, identity or sexuality. ""I'd like to love you, but I'm always wrong"", the duo sing, with just the right blend of pathos and vulnerability, ""and I get chills, chills, chills"". On Spotify, it's currently the most-played song from this year's contest. That's not a guarantee of votes on Saturday night (what if all those plays come from Italians, who can't vote for their own act?) but it's a sign that Ukraine might not have the competition sewn up. If Italy do win, they'll be the first country to have back-to-back victories since Ireland's incredible hat-trick in the early 1990s. Sheldon Riley's costume had to be shipped in one piece, as it can't be dismantled Australia's Sheldon Riley wrote his song, Not The Same, years ago as a message to his younger self, about the struggles of dealing with Asperger's Syndrome and coming to terms with his sexuality in a deeply religious family. He says he's been singing it since he was 15 - but the message has changed from one of despair to hope, as he learned to be proud of his differences. The song's transformation is evident in the staging too. When he won Eurovision - Australia Decides earlier this year, he was dressed in black, surrounded by bleak, industrial sets. Now, he's all in white and bathed in light. And he can barely move. Sheldon's costume weighs 40kg - thanks to the 200,000 Swarovski crystals and 90,000 Swarovski pearls stitched into the fabric. Along with his mask and other accessories, the total weight is 51kg. Imagine his excess baggage charges. Stefan makes full use of the multi-pronged Eurovision stage Believe it or not, when Estonia's Stefan performs on Saturday night, he will only just have woken up. ""Usually, I go to sleep before I go on stage,"" he told Steve Holdenon the Official Eurovison podcast,external. ""I don't know why, but my body tells me, 'you need to rest' and I just go somewhere quiet and take a nap for 15 minutes, and then I wake up like a new person."" There's nothing sleepy about his performance, though, as Stefan bounds around the arena like a little puppy, even taking a daring leap over the stage's built-in waterfall. Let's just hope he remembers to set his alarm. Watch thefirst Eurovision Semi-FinalonBBC iPlayernow. Watch thesecond Eurovision Semi-FinalonBBC iPlayernow.

Elon Musk puts $44bn Twitter deal on hold,"Elon Musk has said his $44bn (Â£35bn) deal to buy Twitter is on hold after he queried the number of fake or spam accounts on the social media platform. He said he was waiting for information ""supporting [the] calculation that spam/fake accounts do indeed represent less than 5% of users"". Mr Muskadded later,externalthat he was ""still committed to [the] acquisition"". However, analysts speculated he could be seeking to renegotiate the price or even walk away from the takeover. Mr Musk's tweets sent Twitter's share price plunging 10% in morning trade in New York. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Even before his comments, the company's stock had been selling for less than the $54.20 per share Mr Musk has offered, a sign that the markets were not convinced he would complete the buyout. Dan Ives, a tech analyst at investment firm Wedbush Securities, said Mr Musk's comments would ""send this Twitter circus show into a Friday the 13th horror show"". ""Many will view this as Musk using this Twitter filing/spam accounts as a way to get out of this deal in a vastly changing market,"" he wrote in a note. ""The nature of Musk creating so much uncertainty in a tweet (and not a filing) is very troubling to us... and now sends this whole deal into a circus show with many questions and no concrete answers as to the path of this deal going forward."" Mr Musk has been vocal about ""defeating the spam bots"", identifying it as a key goal following his planned takeover of the company. Twitter executives ousted ahead of Musk takeover How Elon Musk might change Twitter Twitter has long faced accusations of not doing enough to address automated, fake accounts posting content. In a filing more than two weeks ago, Twitter estimated that fake accounts accounted for fewer than 5% of its daily active users during the first three months of this year. It cautioned that the figures were based on estimates and could be higher. Those claims were not different from what the firm had shared in previous disclosures. The number of spam bots on the service is a key statistic, as a higher than expected figure could hurt the ability to grow advertising revenue or paid-for subscriptions, said Susannah Streeter, analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. But she said it was not clear how genuine Mr Musk's concerns were. ""There will also be questions raised over whether fake accounts are the real reason behind this delaying tactic, given that promoting free speech rather than focusing on wealth creation appeared to be his primary motivation for the takeover,"" she said. ""The $44bn price tag is huge, and it may be a strategy to row back on the amount he is prepared to pay to acquire the platform."" Weeks of market turmoil in the US have wiped billions off the value of many companies - including once favoured tech firms. Tesla, the electric car company where Mr Musk serves as chief executive, has also seen its shares plunge - a hit to Mr Musk, whose status as the world's richest person is bound up in his stake in the company and who had planned to rely on his shares to help finance the Twitter purchase. Last month, he raised $8.5bn by selling shares. He also planned to use the shares to secure $6.5bn in loans. After Mr Musk tweeted that the deal was temporarily on hold, Tesla's share price gained more than 5%. Another twist in the tale of Elon Musk's attempt to own Twitter. One of his priorities, he said, was to ""clean up"" the platform - weeding out the bots and spam accounts that he believes drag it down. Spend any time on it and you'll certainly see evidence of both. However, Twitter says that less than 5% of its active users are fake. So does that mean there is no diamond in the rough to be polished here, that what you see on Twitter is what you get after all? And if so, does that make it less valuable a proposition? It is of course also possible that his new hesitation stems from how he intends to finance the deal - he's already had to sell some of his valuable Tesla stock to raise funds, and that's had an impact on the car firm too. Mr Musk has some thinking to do. Mr Musk's latest move comes after an announcement that two Twitter executivesare leaving the social media company. Kayvon Beykpour, who led Twitter's consumer division, and Bruce Falck, who oversaw revenue, both tweeted on Thursday that the departures were not their decisions. From this week, the firm also said it had paused most hiring, except for ""business critical roles"".

Violence at funeral for killed Al Jazeera reporter,"This video can not be played WATCH: Violent scenes at the funeral of Shireen Abu Aqla Israeli police have hit mourners at the funeral of Al Jazeera reporter Shireen Abu Aqla, whose killing in the occupied West Bank has caused a surge of anger. Her coffin almost fell as police, some using batons, waded into a crowd of Palestinians gathered around it. Police said they acted after being pelted with stones. Abu Aqla was shot dead in disputed circumstances on Wednesday, with Israel and Palestinians trading blame. The killing has been widely condemned. Footage showed a standoff between police and Palestinians gathered around the coffin in the hospital compound, before officers push the crowd back, with some beating and kicking mourners. Police said officers ""were forced to use riot dispersal means"". We were in the car park of St Joseph's hospital, where hundreds of Palestinian mourners had gathered ready for Shireen Abu Aqla's coffin to be carried out into a waiting hearse. There was a shrine of written tributes, a floral crucifix (Shireen was a Palestinian Christian) and poignantly a press flak jacket among the flowers. Many were in tears. There was some chanting and Palestinian flags were being flown. Suddenly the gates to the compound were closed and heavily armed Israeli border police, some on horseback, appeared on the other side of them. Given the circumstances it already felt confrontational. The coffin was brought out of the building carried by a group of pallbearers. While the plan was for the procession to the church to use the hearse, the coffin was now being carried towards the closed gates. What happened next was extraordinary. I was behind the packed crowd so I couldn't see the front point of contact, but the Israeli police suddenly pushed back the crowd, including the coffin and its carriers. They fired stun grenades towards the mourners and the press and were storming into the compound. From my vantage point - not at the front of the crowd - I saw a couple of plastic bottles being thrown back, nothing more. People ran to take cover inside the hospital. I saw a woman with a young baby in a carrier sling distraught, almost being crushed in the panic. The echo of stun grenades rang out in the hospital corridors and wards. I saw at least one man wounded. This seemed to go on for around 10 minutes, as we sought a safe route back towards the car park. After we came out, the coffin left in the hearse through the gates. And now videos have emerged showing what happened while people were rushing inside - Israeli police beating and kicking the pallbearers, who were in retreat carrying Shireen Abu Aqla's coffin. At one stage it nearly slipped from their grasp, falling towards the ground. A spokesman for UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said he was ""deeply disturbed"" by the confrontations between Israeli security forces and Palestinians and the behaviour of some police. White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki also said the images of police hitting mourners were disturbing. ""We regret the intrusion into what should have been a peaceful procession,"" she said. The Palestinian Authority and Al Jazeera claim Abu Aqla was shot dead by Israeli forces, while Israel said it was not yet possible to determine what happened and that she could have been killed by Palestinian gunfire. An Israeli military interim report on Thursday said the fatal shot could have come from ""massive fire from Palestinian gunmen"", or possibly from ""a few bullets"" fired by a soldier ""at a terrorist who was firing at his vehicle"". Sherine Abu Aqla was known to millions for her coverage of the Israel-Palestinian conflict Shireen Abu Aqla, a 51-year-old Palestinian American, was a veteran correspondent for Al Jazeera's Arabic news channel and had reported on the Israel-Palestinian conflict for two decades. Shireen Abu Aqla: Face and voice of war and peace She was given the rarity of a funeral at the compound of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas on Thursday, where her coffin was brought draped in the Palestinian flag. President Abbas paid tribute to her, describing her as a ""martyr of the free word"" who ""sacrificed her life"" to defend the Palestinian cause. He said Israel was ""fully responsible for her killing"" and that he would refer the case to the International Criminal Court, which investigates potential war crimes. Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett has accused Mr Abbas of ""throwing blame at Israel without any basis"". Abu Aqla was in the Jenin refugee camp early on Wednesday to report on the Israeli raid. The Israeli military said the operation was to apprehend ""terrorist suspects"". It said: ""Tens of Palestinian gunmen fired at and hurled explosive devices toward the soldiers. The soldiers responded with fire toward the gunmen and hits were identified."" Another Palestinian journalist, Al Jazeera producer Ali Samoudi, was shot and wounded during the violence. The incident comes at a time of particularly high tension between Israel and the Palestinians, after nearly two months of one of the deadliest periods of violence in years. Israel has carried out operations in Jenin in the wake of a wave of killings of Israeli Jews by Palestinians and Israeli Arabs in Israel and the West Bank. Seventeen Israelis and two Ukrainians have been killed in stabbings, shootings, car rammings and an axe attack. In the same period, dozens of Palestinians have been killed - including assailants shot dead while carrying out attacks, or militants and civilians killed during Israeli raids and confrontations. Four of the Palestinians who carried out attacks in Israel came from the Jenin district. An Israeli police commando meanwhile was killed on Friday during clashes with Palestinian gunmen near Jenin, police said. The commando, who was 47, was shot dead during an operation to arrest a suspect, Israeli authorities said. Doucet: Killed journalist 'inspiration' to a generation.

"Elon Musk puts $44bn Twitter deal on holdThe billionaire wants more data on fake accounts, prompting speculation over the deal's future.Business","Elon Musk has said his $44bn (Â£35bn) deal to buy Twitter is on hold after he queried the number of fake or spam accounts on the social media platform. He said he was waiting for information ""supporting [the] calculation that spam/fake accounts do indeed represent less than 5% of users"". Mr Muskadded later,externalthat he was ""still committed to [the] acquisition"". However, analysts speculated he could be seeking to renegotiate the price or even walk away from the takeover. Mr Musk's tweets sent Twitter's share price plunging 10% in morning trade in New York. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

You may want to readTwitterâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. Even before his comments, the company's stock had been selling for less than the $54.20 per share Mr Musk has offered, a sign that the markets were not convinced he would complete the buyout. Dan Ives, a tech analyst at investment firm Wedbush Securities, said Mr Musk's comments would ""send this Twitter circus show into a Friday the 13th horror show"". ""Many will view this as Musk using this Twitter filing/spam accounts as a way to get out of this deal in a vastly changing market,"" he wrote in a note. ""The nature of Musk creating so much uncertainty in a tweet (and not a filing) is very troubling to us... and now sends this whole deal into a circus show with many questions and no concrete answers as to the path of this deal going forward."" Mr Musk has been vocal about ""defeating the spam bots"", identifying it as a key goal following his planned takeover of the company. Twitter executives ousted ahead of Musk takeover How Elon Musk might change Twitter Twitter has long faced accusations of not doing enough to address automated, fake accounts posting content. In a filing more than two weeks ago, Twitter estimated that fake accounts accounted for fewer than 5% of its daily active users during the first three months of this year. It cautioned that the figures were based on estimates and could be higher. Those claims were not different from what the firm had shared in previous disclosures. The number of spam bots on the service is a key statistic, as a higher than expected figure could hurt the ability to grow advertising revenue or paid-for subscriptions, said Susannah Streeter, analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. But she said it was not clear how genuine Mr Musk's concerns were. ""There will also be questions raised over whether fake accounts are the real reason behind this delaying tactic, given that promoting free speech rather than focusing on wealth creation appeared to be his primary motivation for the takeover,"" she said. ""The $44bn price tag is huge, and it may be a strategy to row back on the amount he is prepared to pay to acquire the platform."" Weeks of market turmoil in the US have wiped billions off the value of many companies - including once favoured tech firms. Tesla, the electric car company where Mr Musk serves as chief executive, has also seen its shares plunge - a hit to Mr Musk, whose status as the world's richest person is bound up in his stake in the company and who had planned to rely on his shares to help finance the Twitter purchase. Last month, he raised $8.5bn by selling shares. He also planned to use the shares to secure $6.5bn in loans. After Mr Musk tweeted that the deal was temporarily on hold, Tesla's share price gained more than 5%. Another twist in the tale of Elon Musk's attempt to own Twitter. One of his priorities, he said, was to ""clean up"" the platform - weeding out the bots and spam accounts that he believes drag it down. Spend any time on it and you'll certainly see evidence of both. However, Twitter says that less than 5% of its active users are fake. So does that mean there is no diamond in the rough to be polished here, that what you see on Twitter is what you get after all? And if so, does that make it less valuable a proposition? It is of course also possible that his new hesitation stems from how he intends to finance the deal - he's already had to sell some of his valuable Tesla stock to raise funds, and that's had an impact on the car firm too. Mr Musk has some thinking to do. Mr Musk's latest move comes after an announcement that two Twitter executivesare leaving the social media company. Kayvon Beykpour, who led Twitter's consumer division, and Bruce Falck, who oversaw revenue, both tweeted on Thursday that the departures were not their decisions. From this week, the firm also said it had paused most hiring, except for ""business critical roles"".

Half a million wait for care as staff crisis bites,"'He's our son - we will do what he needs,' says Tania Tillyer The number of adults waiting for social care in England has risen sharply to more than 500,000, according to estimates by social work bosses. Similar research last year put the figure at about 294,000, says the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services (Adass). ""We're seeing a devastating impact on people's lives,"" said Adass president Sarah McClinton. The government says reforming social care is a priority. Adass blames a growing shortage of care workers, made worse by low pay rates and the cost-of-living crisis. As the population ages, more and more people need social care, defined as help with day-to-day living in their own homes or in supported accommodation. Their needs are increasingly complex but capacity is not keeping pace, says Adass. Children's social care generates excessive profits - report Care workers lose out on Â£7,000 pay, charity says 'It takes a strong person to do this job' The care staffing crisis means ""even more pressure on even more families who are propping up a chronic shortage of services"", according to Helen Walker, chief executive of Carers UK. Tania Tillyer, from Northamptonshire, knows only too well how families are having to pick up the strain. Her 37-year-old son Lee, is quadriplegic and has complex special needs which mean he needs 24-hour care for help with most basic tasks, from changing his incontinence pads and feeding him, to managing his medication and hoisting him when he needs to change his position in bed. ""The majority of it is provided by me and his dad, Brian,"" says Tania. Tania says her own health issues mean the additional care work increases the pain she is in. ""When you're looking after someone 24 hours a day, your priority's them, not yourself... ""Over the years, it's impacted on me greatly, particularly on my back because of back pain that I have... but at the end of the day he's our son. So, you know, we will do what he needs."" Lee has funding from the NHS for three professional carers. One works four nights a week. Two others used to split the weekdays between them. But since one of the day carers got a better paid job five months ago, the family has been unable to find a replacement. The problem is money, says Tania - because the role is only funded up to Â£10 an hour, and no-one with the necessary skills has applied. ""Cleaners and shop workers and other people are actually getting a lot more money per hour, when actually this type of work requires a lot of sensitivity and a lot of skill,"" says Tania. ""If you're not paying the right wage, then people aren't going to want to apply."" In Cleveland, care worker Karen Taggart loves ""being able to change somebody's day and provide them with that little bit of independence that they still want to hold on to, and allow them to be with their families"". But she says poor pay, particularly as the cost of living spirals, puts off many potential recruits. ""People with families, trying to get on the housing ladder, just can't afford to be in a job like this and, as well, I think people have been told that it's really hard. It can be hard, but the rewards outweigh that."" Carer Karen Taggart (R) says the pay puts off some potential care workers Karen's boss, Michelle Jackson, managing director of Caremark Redcar and Cleveland, employs about 280 carers, supporting 570 people. Demand is ""very, very high"" at the moment, says Michelle. ""We constantly get emails from the council and requests for extra care packages. ""Past days we used to be able to take all of that work on and currently we can't,"" she says, estimating that they turn down 80% of new requests, whereas in the past they accepted almost all of them. ""We just can't get enough care workers in the industry."" The problem is low pay, but Caremark cannot put up wages and stay in business, says Michelle ""because we don't get enough money from the council"", and council budgets are in turn limited by what they receive from central government. The only solution is for the government ""to invest properly in homecare so we can build capacity and reduce unmet need"", argues Dr Jane Townson, chief executive of The Homecare Association. Adass's survey went to directors of adult social services in all of England's 152 councils, and 94 responded. The researchers extrapolated the numbers whose needs were not being met in those 94 councils, concluding that 506,131 people, across England, are waiting for: a social care assessment care to begin a review of their care Although 16% more hours of home care are being delivered across England, this is dwarfed by an almost sevenfold increase in hours that cannot be delivered, because of a shortage of care workers. In the first three months of this year, 170,000 hours of home care each week could not be delivered, the survey suggests. Ms McClinton said that althoughthe government's health and social care reformshelp a bit, they fall short in addressing the most pressing issues, ""how we respond to rapidly increasing unmet need for essential care and support, and resolve the workforce crisis by properly valuing care professionals"". ""We have not seen the bounceback in services after the pandemic in the way we had hoped. ""In fact the situation is getting worse rather than better."" Social care is 'far from fixed', says Adass president, Sarah McClinton In a statement, the Department of Health and Social Care said reforming adult social care was a priority for the government which was investing Â£5.4bn over three years from April, funded by the Health and Social Care Levy. ""This includes Â£3.6bn to reform the social care charging system and enable all local authorities to move towards paying providers a fair cost of care and a further Â£1.7bn to begin major improvements across adult social care in England,"" said an official.

"Worse still to come, Sri Lanka's new PM warns","This video can not be played PM Ranil Wickramasinghe: ""It is going to get worse before it gets better"" Sri Lanka's new prime minister has told the BBC an economic crisis that has brought misery and unrest is ""going to get worse before it gets better"". The country is facing fuel shortages and soaring food prices, with some Sri Lankans forced to skip meals. Anger over the government's handling of the crisis has led to violent protests. Ranil Wickremesinghe was appointed in an attempt to defuse the protests. It is the opposition MP's sixth stint as prime minister. Sri Lanka's crisis explained How the soaring cost of living is hitting Sri Lankans hard How Sri Lanka's war heroes became villains In his first interview since taking office, Mr Wickremesinghe told the BBC he would ensure families get three meals a day. Appealing to the world for more financial help, he said ""there won't be a hunger crisis, we will find food"". The new PM described the Sri Lankan economy as ""broken"", but he said his message to Sri Lankans was to ""be patient, I will bring things back"". Mr Wickremesinghe was sworn-in by President Gotabaya Rajapaksa on Thursday, but his appointment has largely been met with dismay, as he is seen as too close to the politically dominant Rajapaksa family. In his interview, Mr Wickremesinghe said he agreed with the sentiment of protestors who've been calling for President Rajapaksa to resign, but said that would not happen. ""Blaming won't lead to action, I'm here to see people nourished,"" he said. But he added that he was ""going to change all the policies of the Rajapaksa government"". He also called on the international community for help. ""We need your assistance for a year, whatever we get from you we will repay. Help us to do it. We are the longest and oldest democracy in Asia,"" he said. Long queues for essentials are now part of daily life in Sri Lanka, for those that can afford them Sri Lanka's economy is in freefall. Food, medicine and fuel have run out or become unaffordable. Some people have died waiting at petrol stations to fill up their tanks. It is the the island nation's worst economic crisis since gaining independence from Britain in 1948. ""We don't have kerosene, we don't have petrol, we don't have diesel, we don't have cooking gas and we don't even have access to wood-fired stoves,"" a 68-year-old woman in the Sri Lankan capital Columbo told AFP. ""We are struggling everyday to feed our children. Food prices have tripled in the past few days. How are we supposed to manage?"" At the heart of Sri Lanka's economic woes is that the country is heavily reliant on imports but has been burning through the foreign currency reserves it needs to pay for them. The economy suffered in the Covid pandemic and tourism was hit by the 2019 church bombings. But experts have also blamed economic mismanagement too. Sri Lanka is an island nation off southern India: It won independence from British rule in 1948. Three ethnic groups - Sinhalese, Tamil and Muslim - make up 99% of the country's 22m population. One family of brothers has dominated for years: Mahinda Rajapaksa became a hero among the majority Sinhalese in 2009 when his government defeated Tamil separatist rebels after years of bitter and bloody civil war. His brother Gotabaya, who was defence secretary at the time, is now president. Now an economic crisis has led to fury on the streets: Soaring inflation has meant some foods, medication and fuel are in short supply, there are rolling blackouts and ordinary people have taken to the streets in anger with many blaming the Rajapaksa family and their government for the situation.

DUP say protocol protest a clear message to PM,"Boris Johnson will visit Northern Ireland on Monday amid a power-sharing crisis sparked by rising tensions over post-Brexit trading arrangements, Sinn FÃ©in's Michelle O'Neill has said. It comes as the DUP blocked the election of a Speaker to a new assembly on Friday, meaning it cannot function. The DUP said its actions sent a ""clear message"" about its opposition to the NI Protocol. Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said the PM must ""outline what he intends to do"". Mr Johnson's visit coincides with increased speculation that the government is poised to introduce legislation to strip away parts of the Northern Ireland Protocol.

The Northern Ireland Protocol, a part of the UK-EU Brexit deal which keeps Northern Ireland aligned with the EU single market for goods, places a trade border in the Irish Sea between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.

DUP criticised for blocking NI Assembly Speaker,"Boris Johnson will visit Northern Ireland on Monday amid a power-sharing crisis sparked by rising tensions over post-Brexit trading arrangements, Sinn FÃ©in's Michelle O'Neill has said.

LiveLiveRussian battalion wiped out in failed river crossing - UK20 minutes ago,"Ukraine's defence minister says he hopes to arm a million fighters as the country prepares for a ""new, long phase of war"" The arrival of foreign weapons and ""stimulating Ukrainian producers"" will help further tip the balance against Russia, Oleksiy Reznikov says Russian troops made three unsuccessful attempts to build bridges across a river in eastern Ukraine, Luhansk's regional governor says Images from the scene show dozens of burnt-out tanks after Ukrainian forces shelled the temporary structures Ukrainian defenders destroyed around 70 units of heavy weaponry and equipment over three days, says Serhiy Haidai The first alleged war crime case since the conflict began has started in Ukraine's capital Kyiv Russian soldier Vadim Shishimarin, 21, faces possible life imprisonment on charges of war crimes and premeditated murder Edited by Chris Giles Please join ushere for updates and analysis over the weekend. We're closing our live coverage of the war in Ukraine for today in a little while. We'll leave you with a brief recap of what's happened: Fighting in the east  Beyond the Donbas region  In diplomacy  You can read about more of the day's key events here. Ukraine has said it is returning the bodies of fallen Russian troops back home. On Friday, military officials were seen loading and stacking bodies collected from the Kyiv and Chernihiv regions onto refrigerated rail cars. The move is in accordance with ""the norms of international humanitarian law"", according to Volodymyr Lyamzin, the head of Ukraine's civil-military cooperation. ""After the active phase of the conflict is over, sides have to return the bodies of the military of another country. Ukraine is ready to return the bodies to the aggressor,â Lyamzin told the Reuters news agency. Several refrigerated trains have reportedly been stationed in other parts of the country as well. Ukraine claims it has killed some 20,000 Russian troops. Russia has not updated its death toll since 25 March, when it acknowledged 1,351 deaths. TheBBC Ukrainian serviceis reporting that the Ukrainian army has released two decks of cards depicting Russians they suspect of war crimes. The idea replicates the set of55 playing cardsthat the US military produced in the 2003 invasion of Iraq, depicting what it said were the most wanted members of Saddam Hussein's government. Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Valerii Zaluzhnyi, said the cards were produced with the help of volunteers from the international intelligence community InformNapalm. US President Joe Biden has spoken with the leaders of Finland and Sweden about their plans to join the Nato alliance. The White House said Biden had held a joint phone call with Finnish President Sauli NiinistÃ¶ and Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson about the issue on Friday. A readout of the call claims the trio discussed Natoâs Open Door policy and ""the right of Finland and Sweden to decide their own future, foreign policy, and security arrangements"". Afterwards, NiinistÃ¶ wrote on Twitter that he ""went through Finland's next steps towards Nato membership"" on the call. It comes a day after NiinistÃ¶ and Finland's PM Sanna Marin called for the historically neutral country to apply for Nato membership ""without delay"". Sweden will announce its own decision on joining Nato on Sunday. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

As we reported on Thursday, a US lawmaker has single-handedly blocked a multi billion-dollar aid package to Ukraine from passing this week. President Joe Biden had called on Congress to send the bill - $39.8bn in economic, humanitarian and security assistance - to his desk by the end of the week, but Senator Rand Paul blocked an expedited vote on Thursday evening alleging that the government was ""shuffling money out the door as fast as they can"" with no oversight. ""My oath of office is to the US Constitution, not to any foreign nation,"" Paul said on the Senate floor defending his decision. ""We cannot save Ukraine by dooming the US economy."" The senator from Kentucky is calling for a watchdog provision in the bill to oversee how the money is being spent, an amendment that would require further delays in the bill's passage. Congressional leaders have chided the congressman for causing the delay, as the current bill has enough votes to pass in the Senate through regular order but this will now not happen until next week. Paul's defiance has been lauded in some corners, with former president Donald Trump's son arguing lawmakers in Washington - or ""the swamp"" as he called them - ""don't want transparency"".

Sweden and Finland have said that they will hold talks with the Turkish government after its president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, said he was not in favour of their plans to join Nato. The Swedish and Finnish foreign ministers, Ann Linde and Pekka Haavisto said they would speak to their Turkish counterpart, Mevlut Cavusoglu, about the issue at a Nato meeting on Saturday. Erdogan said that Nordic countries had given asylum to people Turkey considers to be Kurdish terrorists. He added that he did not want Nato to repeat what he called the mistake of the past when it allowed Greece to join. Responding to Turkey's comments, the US said Turkey ""is a valued Nato ally"" and ""they've been involved and helpful in trying to get a dialogue going here, between Russia and Ukraine"". John Kirby, press secretary for the US Ministry of Defence, added ""we're working to better clarify the [Turkey's] position here"". Law enforcement officers in Ukraine are investigating 41 Russian servicemen suspected of having committed war crimes in the country, Interfax-Ukraine news agency reports. Prosecutor-General Iryna Venediktova said the suspects will be investigated for a range of crimes - from the bombing of civilian infrastructure, killing of civilians, rape and looting. The suspects will answer before a Ukrainian court of law, she added. Today, a Russian soldier accused of killing an unarmed 62-year-old civilian appeared in court in Kyiv. Vadim Shishimarin, 21, was brought to court for a preliminary hearing. He faces possible life imprisonment on charges of war crimes and premeditated murder. During a televised address on Friday evening, Venediktova said preliminary hearings on two more suspects will be carried out next week. The leader of breakaway region South Ossetia has announced a referendum on whether to become a part of Russia. A statement from the office of Anatoly Bibilov said it was his people's ""historic aspiration"" to come together with Russia, and the vote would take place on 17 July. Moscow recognises the region as independent, after a brief war between Russia and Georgia in 2008, and has provided financial support, Russian citizenship for its citizens and sited military bases there. Georgia maintains that South Ossetia is an occupied territory and previously said that a referendum on joining Russia would be unacceptable. Negotiations with Russia over freeing the Ukrainian fighters under siege in the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol were ""very difficult"", Ukraine's deputy prime minister has said. In an online post, Iryna
Vereshchuk wrote: ""The result may not be to everyone's liking, but our task is
to evacuate our boys. All of them. ""Alive."" Yesterday, the Ukrainian government said that it was pushing for safe passage for 38 badly wounded fighters, in exchange for captured Russians. The Azovstal complex once sheltered hundreds of civilians and fighters, but after several weeks trapped underground civilians were freed in a series of humanitarian convoys last week and negotiations over the fighters began. The Russian air force has attacked an arms depot in the Kharkiv region in Ukraine, state news agency RIA reports. The news agency quoted the Russian defence ministry saying it had hit the facility on Friday. Meanwhile, eyewitnesses to an earlier attack in Kharkiv told news agency AFP that they had been targeted by a Russian tank as they tried to seek shelter at home. ""Four people died, two were injured. My daughter died from a shrapnel wound in the back of her head,"" Olga Karpenko, 52, said. The BBC has not been able to independently verify this information. Sergei Shoigu (pictured) spoke with his US counterpart for an hour More details have emerged of the telephone call between US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin and Russia's Defence Minister Sergei Shoygu, in which General Austin called for an immediate ceasefire. Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said that Gen Austin had stressed the importance of maintaining communication, after Moscow had appeared uninterested in speaking to the US on previous attempts to hold the conversation. An anonymous US official said the tone of the hour-long call was ""professional"", but did not resolve any specific issues or lead to changes in Russian policy, news agency Reuters report. Russia's defence ministry confirmed that the US had initiated the call, and discussed ""topical issues of international security... including the situation in Ukraine"". Olga IvshinaSenior correspondent, BBC News Russian Since the start of the war, our team has been following and verifying reports of losses among Russian troops fighting in Ukraine by following official announcements, local media reports as well as social media and speaking to the relatives of Russian servicemen. Up to this moment BBC News Russian has been able to verify the deaths of 2,336 Russian servicemen. We have been able to establish their names, ranks and military units where they served. This is nearly twice the latest official figure released by the Russian Defence Ministry in March. It is likely that the real figure of the Russian military in Ukraine is far higher than we have been able to establish. But our data analysis helps to see the trends of what is happening with the Russian army fighting in Ukraine. Nearly 20% of all confirmed military casualties are officers. This proportion has remained unchanged for the past three months. Experts say that Russian officers may have to risk more on the frontline because of persistent problems with communications. Over 25% of all losses are paratroopers and marines. These units are often used in reconnaissance and storming operations. However they often donât get enough operational support and evacuation opportunities for the wounded. Most of the casualties, confirmed by us, came from the least developed and economically deprived regions of Russia. There are only three confirmed deaths of servicemen from Moscow, even though the capital makes up almost 9% of the Russian population. Ukrainian authorities now say that nearly 27,000 Russian soldiers have been killed. Read the full story on the BBC's Russian service here. As we've been reporting, Ukraine's Defence Minister Oleksiy Reznikov has said the country is entering a new stage of the war. Reznikov pledged to arm a million fighters using the new weapons and military equipment the US and other Western countries have been donating to the country over the last couple of weeks. The defence minister said that during the beginning of the war, ""volunteers were extremely helpful"" and it's thanks to their mobility that they ""quickly resolved highly pressing issues"". Reznikov said that to win, Ukraine ""must plan resources carefully and avoid mistakes"" and was investing in Ukrainian production facilities to ""ensure the stability and frequency of deliveries"". In his statement on Facebook, he said that Ukraine had relied on charitable aid from citizens, volunteers, and civic organisations for a significant proportion of its military equipment. He said that at the end of April, Ukraine's ministry of defence was relying on donations for 50% of the bullet proof vests used in combat. But as of 13 May, Ukraine has managed to increase its production to provide 57% of the armed forces' bullet proof vests, he added. More now on the suspension of electricity exports from Russia to Finland, which followed rising tensions over Helsinki's announcement of its plan to join Nato. RAO Nordic, a subsidiary of the Russian company Inter RAO, said non-payment was behind its decision to halt electrity supplies. The company said they had not received funds since 6 May and described the situation as ""exceptional"", adding that it is the first time it's happened ""in over 20 years of our trading history"". It did not specify whether this was due to the impact of sanctions but added, ""we hope that the situation will get improved soon and the electricity trade with Russia could resume"". Meanwhlle, the Finnish grid operator Fingrid said it did not anticpate any problems with supply as a result of the suspension. It said it would make up the shortfall by generating more power domestically and increasing imports from Sweden. This video can not be played Scenes of devastation as 'Russian battalion destroyed' If you're just joining us, here's a little recap of the latest events in Ukraine to bring you up to speed. Russian bridge-building foiled  Beyond the Donbas region  In diplomacy Ukraine's defence minister has said he hopes to arm a million fighters as the country prepares for a ""new, long phase of war"". Oleksiy Reznikov noted in a Facebook post that Ukraine would ""need to meticulously plan resources"" and ""avoid mistakes"" in order to win the war. Already, he said, Russia had suffered a ""strategic defeat"". The arrival of foreign weapons and ""stimulating Ukrainian producers"" would help further tip the balance against Russia, he continued. But before that, Ukraine was ""facing extremely difficult weeks ahead"". ""Nobody can tell how many. In that period, we will hold the defence primarily with our own resources against the enemy mad with rage,"" he predicted, in comments translated by our colleagues at BBC Monitoring. ""Increasing pressure of sanctions against Russia and increasing foreign assistance to Ukraine should create, within several months, the conditions under which the Kremlin will finally lose all chances to achieve any success. Then a new window of opportunity will appear for Ukraine. In this extremely hard period, we need unity, cohesion, will and patience,"" he concluded. Electricity exports from Russia to Finland are being suspended from 01:00 local time (22:00 GMT) on Saturday. Finnish grid operator Fingrid said Russian utility Inter RAO was stopping supplies due to ""problems in receiving payments for electricity sold on the market"". The announcement comes the day after Finland signalled its intention to join Nato. Finland only buys 10% of its electricity from Russia, and according to Fingrid it will make up the shortfall by sourcing more power from Sweden, and increasing generation in Finland. Finland expects to become self-sufficient in electrical energy in 2023, the company added. Sophie WilliamsBBC News, Lviv Ukraine says it's thwarted Russian attempts to create a key bridging point A Ukrainian military analyst admits that constant attacks
from Moscow mean the Ukrainians are on the back foot around the Siversky Donets
river â even though theyâve managed to thwart Russian attempts to put down
bridges near Severodonetsk. âThe advantage is now on the side of the Russian Federation,â
Oleh Zhdanov tells the BBC. âWe still can't bring down Russia's offensive pace.â Zhdanov says itâs âvery importantâ that his
side keeps control of this part of the Siversky Donets. Gaining the area would allow the Russians to make a
bridgehead and advance in the direction of the riverâs estuary, Zhdanov explains.
This would let them encircle the key city of Severodonetsk more fully as they
attempt to cut off Ukraineâs whole eastern Donbas region. The order for soldiers to gain this territory came
from the very top, Zhdanov adds. âThey are advancing so hard because it is a
political task, because Putin has ordered it,â he says. As weâve been reporting today, UK
defence intelligence says a Russian battalion lost almost all its armoured
vehicles during failed attempts to establish bridges across the river. Russia
has not commented. Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoygu and his US counterpart Lloyd Austin have spoken for the first time since 18 February - before Russia invaded Ukraine. According to a statement issued by the Pentagon, Austin urged an immediate ceasefire in Ukraine and used the call to emphasise the importance of maintaining lines of communication. On Wednesday, Austin held talks with UK Defence Minister Ben Wallace. In a statement, Wallace said the two leaders pledged ""to continue to work with unity and resolve to provide
Ukraine with what it needs to defend itself against Russiaâs
unprovoked invasion"". Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
UK adds Putin's former wife to sanctions listBoth Vladimir Putin's former wife and his alleged current girlfriend are sanctioned over the war in Ukraine.UK,"Lyudmila Ocheretnaya (L) and Alina Kabaeva The UK has imposed sanctions on Russian President Vladimir Putin's former wife and his alleged current girlfriend over the invasion of Ukraine. Lyudmila Ocheretnaya, who was married to the president until 2014, and former Olympic gymnast Alina Kabaeva, face UK travel bans and asset freezes. The UK has now placed more than 1,000 people on itsRussian sanctions list,external. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said Britain was ""tightening the vice"" on Mr Putin's ""inner circle"". The UK was ""exposing and targeting the shady network propping up Putin's luxury lifestyle"", she said, and would ""keep going with sanctions on all those aiding and abetting Putin's aggression until Ukraine prevails"". Ms Truss said sanctions against Russia should only be lifted when all of its troops had left Ukraine. Earlier,she told a meeting of G7 foreign ministers in Germany that allies should go ""further and faster""in supporting Ukraine's resistance. She said President Putin must face a defeat that prevents further aggression - but some analysts have warned this stance may make a political settlement harder. Earlier this month it was reported that the EU planned to sanction more Russian individuals, including Ms Kabaeva. Since Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February, thousands of civilians and combatants have been killed or injured, and some 14 million people have fled their homes, with more than six million seeking refuge abroad. War in Ukraine: live updates Since her divorce, Lyudmila Ocheretnaya has benefited from preferential business relationships with state-owned entities and exhibited significant unexplained wealth, the UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) says.

Will ministers do more on cost of living?,"The Queen's absence from an occasion grounded in near timeless ritual and ceremony felt profound. The Prince of Wales was deputising and, as former royal correspondent Jennie Bond put it beautifullyon the BBC's Newscast podcast, he was walking in his future. But remember, the State Opening of Parliament, for all its colour, is a shopping list delivered from a throne. It is a collection of proposed new laws that the government plans (or hopes) to get round to in the next year or so. It isn't - and it can't be - a Budget. And that is the very thing that Labour is clamouring for, an ""emergency Budget"" as they call it. We can't spend our way out of trouble, says PM Britons skip meals as food prices rise - charity Why are prices rising so quickly? So after the ceremony in the morning, the politics in the afternoon fell into the broadly familiar tram tracks of recent political debate. A chorus of consistency from the opposition parties, arguing the government must do more, and ministers arguing they have done quite a bit already, and there will be more to come. There is an awareness in government of the potential plunge over the next year or so towards recession. Already, prices are spiralling and the prospect is they will spiral further. And the recent economic context shapes the political debate now. Covid prompted a government intervention in the economy, with ideas such as furlough, that was so big you could see it from space - hundreds of billions of pounds of life support at a time where the fear of depression, not merely recession, stalked Whitehall. Such a recent and colossal crutch propping up the economy has created a precedent and a comparator, against which support now can be seen as puny. As ministers wrestle with the financial consequences of the pandemic, there is a bill of Â£80bn a year in interest payments on the national debt. They draw a parallel with pandemic - how the economic crunch will require the same ""ingenuity and compassion."" But the prime minister adds that ""no country is immune"" from what he sees as the economic aftershocks of Covid and the war in Ukraine. And crucially, he adds: ""No government can realistically shield everyone from the impact."" That is very different to the messagingat the worst moments of Covid. Few would suggest the government's intervention could or should be on the scale of a once in a century pandemic. But the yardstick against which any help can be very recently compared makes it harder for ministers to look like they get the scale of the current squeeze for so many. The big question is whether, having suggested they will do more in the autumn, they'll feel compelled to do more much sooner.

Russia threatens retaliation for Finland Nato move,"Finland has a 1,300km border with Russia Russia has said it will be forced to take ""retaliatory steps"" over its neighbour Finland's move to join Nato. A foreign ministry statement said the move would seriously damage bilateral relations, as well as security and stability in northern Europe. Earlier, Finland's president and PM called for the country to apply for Nato membership ""without delay"". It comes amid a surge in public support for Nato membership following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Finland shares a 1,300-km (810-mile) border with Russia. Until now, it has stayed out of Nato to avoid antagonising its eastern neighbour. Finland will formally announce its decision on Sunday after it has been considered by parliament and other senior political figures. Sweden has said it will announce a similar decision on the same day. Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has said he expects the process of giving Sweden and Finland membership to happen ""quite quickly"". The White House said the US would back a Nato application from both countries if they apply. Are Finland and Sweden going from neutral to Nato? What is Nato and could Finland and Sweden join? Is Nato's Nordic expansion a threat or boost to Europe? The Russian statement (in Russian),externaldescribed Finland's move as ""a radical change in the country's foreign policy"". ""Finland's accession to Nato will cause serious damage to bilateral Russian-Finnish relations and the maintaining of stability and security in the Northern European region,"" it said. ""Russia will be forced to take retaliatory steps, both of a military-technical and other nature, in order to neutralise the threats to its national security that arise from this."" However, Moscow has not specified what steps it plans to take. Russia's deputy UN representative Dmitry Polyansky said Sweden and Finland would become possible targets for Russia if they become Nato members, according to Russian news agency Ria. This video can not be played Watch: Pekka Haavisto tells the BBC that Russiaâs invasion was a turning point for Finland wanting to join Nato Russian officials were responding to a joint statement by Finnish President Sauli Niinisto and Prime Minister Sanna Marin, which said the two leaders expected a decision on Nato membership in the next few days. ""Nato membership would strengthen Finland's security,"" it said. ""As a member of Nato, Finland would strengthen the entire defence alliance. Finland must apply for Nato membership without delay."" Speaking to journalists later, Mr Niinisto responded to Russian concerns and blamed the move on Moscow's invasion. ""Joining Nato would not be against anyone. You caused this. Look in the mirror,"" he said. An opinion poll last week put support in Finland for joining Nato at 76%, with 12% against, a big swing towards membership since before the invasion. Finland and the USSR were on opposing sides in World War Two, with the Finns famously fending off a Soviet invasion in 1939-40. But Finland lost 10% of its territory in the final peace agreement and remained non-aligned throughout the Cold War. Its accession to Nato would more than double the length of Russia's borders with the alliance. Sweden does not have a border with Russia.

How much plastic do you use in a week?,"Thousands of people will count their plastic waste for a week in a national survey of how much we consume. The count, put together by the organisation Everyday Plastic and Greenpeace, starts on Monday. Only the US uses more plastic per person per year than the UK,research suggests.,external Campaigners say the count will shed a unique light on how households consume the environmentally damaging material. Huge amounts of energy and fossil fuels are needed to make new plastic, and it sticks around in our environment for a long time. It is also only possible to recycle plastic two or three times before it becomes too degraded. Microplastics have been found everywhere fromhuman blood,externaltoArctic snow. Around 151,000 households, 96 MPs, and 4,180 classrooms will be tallying up each piece of plastic they use from 16-22 May. Government figures suggest that UK householdsrecycled 44% of their waste in 2020,external. But some plastics put in recycling bins goes to landfill or incinerators, or is even sent abroad where it can be dumped instead. In 2020 BBC News uncovered mountains ofplastic waste sent from the UK to Turkey. ""This count is the UK's biggest ever investigation of plastics. Millions of us do our part to recycle but we don't really know where our plastic waste ends up,"" Greenpeace plastics campaigner Chris Thorne told BBC News. Everyday Plastic founder Daniel Webb counted his plastic for a year in 2017, filling 40 bin bags with waste. ""This experience changed my life and changed how I understood the problem. Then I thought, what if other people did the same experiment as I did?"" he told BBC News. Green light for 'historic' plastics treaty Why plastic recycling is so confusing Recycling plastic does not work - Boris Johnson Participants in the Big Plastic Count receive a pack explaining how to count the plastics they use, broken down into 19 categories. They then tally up each type of plastic waste before putting it in the bin or the recycling. The data will be analysed by Everyday Plastic and Greenpeace to produce a national picture of plastic waste. The campaigners say radical action by government and supermarkets is required to reduce how much plastic is produced and to improve recycling rates. Maria Hughes, who lives in Newport, Wales with her husband and two children, said she is taking part because she feels we are ""drowning in plastic"". ""I can't achieve the change needed alone. Ultimately we need manufacturers and supermarkets to change the packaging our food is in,"" she told BBC News. Nadiya Catel-Arutyunova, Sustainability Policy Advisor at the British Retail Consortium, told BBC News: ""Retailers have been committed to removing single-use packaging for some time. Many have signed up to the Plastics Pact, working with suppliers to eliminate problematic or unnecessary single-use plastic packaging. UK supermarkets are also investing in their reuse/refill offerings to radically cut down on packaging.""

North Korea announces first death from Covid-19,"North Korean leader Kim Jong Un appeared in a face mask on television for the first time on Thursday to order nationwide lockdowns North Korea has confirmed its first death from Covid-19, with state media adding that tens of thousands more are experiencing fever symptoms. Six people died after suffering a fever with one testing positive for Omicron, state media reported on Friday. It said 187,000 people with a fever were being ""isolated and treated"". While experts believe the virus has been present in the country for some time, the authorities only announced the first cases on Thursday. They said there had been an outbreak of the Omicron variant in the capital, Pyongyang, and announced lockdown measures. They did not give precise case numbers. But in an update on Friday, the official KCNA news agency reported that the outbreak extended beyond the capital. ""A fever whose cause couldn't be identified spread explosively nationwide from late April,"" it said. Around 350,000 people had shown signs of that fever, it added, without specifying how many had tested positive for Covid. An image released by state media showed officials - all wearing face masks - meeting Kim Jong-un to discuss Covid-19 Analysts suggest the latest figures from state media, including the acknowledgement that the unspecified fever had spread nationwide, may indicate the country is experiencing an outbreak unlike any it has seen so far. Its population of 25 million is vulnerable due to the lack of a vaccination programme and poor healthcare, experts say. Why doesn't North Korea have enough food? How dangerous is the situation in North Korea? North Korea rejected offers from the international community to supply millions of AstraZeneca and Chinese-made jabs last year. Instead, it claimed it had controlled Covid by sealing its borders early in January 2020. The country shares land borders with South Korea and China, which have both battled outbreaks. China is now struggling to contain an Omicron wave with lockdowns in its biggest cities. On Friday, KCNA reported that the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un had visited a healthcare centre and ""learned about the nationwide spread of Covid-19"". It described the situation as an ""immediate public health crisis"". These numbers give us the first indication that the virus has spread rapidly around the country, far beyond the capital Pyongyang. This puts the entire population of 25 million at risk. No-one is vaccinated, many are malnourished, and the health care system is poor. But the virus itself may not present the biggest danger. The lockdown could have devastating consequences for people. Food and medicine are already in short supply, thanks to efforts by authorities to keep the virus out - they've sealed the country's borders for more than two years, cutting off virtually all trade. We don't know yet how aggressive these lockdowns will be, and whether people will be confined to their homes. Kim Jong-un wants some work to continue. But it is very possible that the markets, where many earn a living, will be closed. It will also be more difficult for people to move around the country. This in turn will make it even harder for them to get hold of the food and supplies they need to survive. By publishing these figures today, some say North Korea is showing it might finally be willing to accept outside help. At a meeting outlining new Covid rules on Thursday, Mr Kim was seen wearing a face mask on television for what was believed to be the first time. He ordered ""maximum emergency"" virus controls, which appeared to include orders for local lockdowns and gathering restrictions in workplaces. There are fears a major outbreak could make it even more difficult for essential supplies to enter the country, worsening food shortages and a faltering economy. South Korea has said it offered humanitarian aid after Thursday's announcement, but Pyongyang is yet to respond. Despite North Korea's earlier claims that it had ""shining success"" in keeping out Covid, there have been signs throughout the pandemic of its possible presence in the country, including unconfirmed reports of cases and workers wearing hazmat suits.

"Dangerous staffing levels in hospitals, says union","Unison says staffing levels are at dangerous levels in Scottish Borders hospitals A trade union has written to every politician representing the Scottish Borders to highlight ""dangerous staffing levels"" in local hospitals. Unison claims serious breaches of safety guidelines are occurring daily due to a lack of nurses, auxiliaries and porters. The letter says staff are unable to take proper rest breaks or log serious incidents in the reporting system. NHS Borders said patient and staff safety was its number one priority. Unison said working conditions in the area were regularly in breach of regulations. Greig Kelbie, the union's regional officer in the Borders, said: ""We are getting regular messages from our members to tell us about the pressure they are under - and that they can't cope. Health board launches Covid virtual ward Routine operations paused at Covid-hit NHS board 'We are busier than any of the busiest winters' ""The care system was under pressure before Covid, but the pandemic has exasperated the situation, particularly at NHS Borders. ""The NHS has been stretched to its limits and it is now at the stage where it is dangerous for patients and staff - we're often told about serious breaches of health and safety, particularly at Borders General Hospital where there are issues with flooring and staff falling. ""We work collaboratively with NHS Borders to do what we can, but we also wanted to make politicians aware of how bad things have become. ""We need our politicians to step up and implement change - we want them to make sure the Health and Care Act is brought to the fore and that it protects our members."" The Health and Care (Staffing) (Scotland) Act 2019 was introduced to ensure the wellbeing of staff, provide safe and high quality services, and to improve standards. But staff shortages have increased significantly across all health boards during the pandemic due to self-isolating and Covid-related illnesses. Unison, which represents hundreds of health staff and care workers in the region, believes NHS Borders staff are at a further disadvantage due the staff bank system partnership with the Lothians for covering vacant shifts. Mr Kelbie added: ""The Borders shares a bank with Lothians health and that is proving quite challenging as most people on the bank prefer to take the shifts in Edinburgh and the Lothians rather than coming down here. ""We've raised the issues already at a local level, and now we're raising them with the decision-makers in the parliaments."" NHS Borders chief executive Ralph Roberts assured all staff last month that his board was determined to address challenges caused by staff shortages. A further meeting took place this week with trade union representatives to reassure them that management's focus is on making services as safe as possible. Mr Roberts added: ""We have a duty of care to our staff, patients, students and volunteers. ""We fully acknowledge the challenges staff continue to face as a result of service pressures, the level of staffing gaps because of vacancies, leave and sickness absence - and the continued impact of Covid-19. ""We are committed to working to meet the requirements of the Health and Care (Staffing) (Scotland) Act. ""Whilst we continue to take steps to support improvement, including a series of actions to improve patient flow and work on a local workforce strategy and plan, we acknowledge there are no short-term fixes and that the health and social care system is experiencing significant pressure across the whole of Scotland and the rest of the UK. ""We would like to take this opportunity to reassure people that patient and staff safety remains our number one priority and thank our staff, once again, for their continued commitment and professionalism during such difficult times.""

Big C podcaster Deborah James gets a damehood,"This video can not be played Watch: Deborah James ""can't really do anything more"" to fight cancer Podcast host Deborah James has been honoured with a damehood just days after revealing she is receiving end-of-life care for her bowel cancer. The mother-of-two has raised more than Â£4m since Monday, when she launched a fund for others with cancer after announcing she had stopped treatment. The host of theBBC's You, Me and the Big C podcastsaid she was ""blown away and crying"" at being made a dame. Dame Deborah, 40, is now being cared for at her parents' home. Damehoods and knighthoods are usually announced as part of the New Year Honours or the Queen's Birthday Honours. But, in exceptional circumstances, some are announced at other times of the year - as happened with Captain Sir Tom Moore's knighthood. Downing Street confirmed the granting of the honour in a press release, which said: ""The Queen has been pleased to approve that the honour of Damehood be conferred upon Deborah James."" Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: ""If ever an honour was richly deserved, this is it. Deborah has been an inspiration and her honesty, warmth and courage has been a source of strength to so many people. ""Through her tireless campaigning and by so openly sharing her experience she has not only helped in our fight against this terrible disease, she has ensured countless others with the Big C have not felt alone."" You, Me and the Big C: Deborah James' last dance William and Kate praise for Big C's Deborah James All I want is more life, says Big C's Deborah James My body can't continue, says Big C's Deborah James Dame Deborah began co-presenting You, Me and the Big C alongside Lauren Mahon and BBC Radio 5 Live newsreader Rachael Bland in 2018, with the show earning praise for its frank discussion of cancer. They spoke to celebrity guests and addressed practical matters, including hair loss, tips for dealing with finances and telling your nearest and dearest about illnesses. Blanddied at the age of 40, six months after the show launched. She had been diagnosed with breast cancer two years earlier. Dame Deborah has been praised for her no-nonsense approach to talking about cancer online, and has shared her experiences of treatment and daily life with her social media followers since her diagnosis in 2016. James co-hosted You, Me and the Big C with Rachael Bland (left) and Lauren Mahon (centre) In anInstagram post,externalon Monday, she revealed she did not know how long she had left to live after stopping treatment and moving to hospice-at-home care. The former deputy headteacher said her liver had stopped working over the past six months and doctors had advised that more treatment was ""fruitless"", adding her ""body does not want to play ball"". The podcaster told the BBC's Graham Satchell she had gone to her parents' home to spend her remaining time with her family because it was ""where I always wanted to die"". She explained this meant their family home in London could remain home for her children without the ""medical equipment scars"" in their memories. She also announced the Bowelbabe fund, to fund research into personalised medicine for cancer patients and to support campaigns to raise awareness of bowel cancer. The fund, named after her online social media handle, surpassed Â£1m in less than 24 hours - smashing her initial goal of Â£250,000. Prince William and Catherine - who donated to James' research fund - praised her ""tireless efforts"" in raising awareness of cancer as inspirational, and thanked her for ""giving hope"" to those living with the disease.

"UKâs nuclear push may add to bills, minister says","Hinkley Point C is one of up to eight new nuclear power stations and the first to be built in 20 years The government's efforts to build new nuclear power plants will increase household energy costs, it has said. A new reactor will ""add at most a few pounds a year to typical household energy bills during the early stages of construction,"" officials said. But they claimed households would pay less than Â£1 a month extra on average over the whole construction period. It comes after Kwasi Kwarteng told the BBC there might be a ""small effect"" on bills under a new funding model. The business secretary said ""nothing should be taken off the table"" to ease pressures on the cost of living, including a windfall tax on excess profits of oil and gas companies. The BBC spoke to Mr Kwarteng as he visited north Wales, where the government has pledged to build a new nuclear power station at Wylfa on Anglesey. A previous plan for a new nuclear power station at Wylfacollapsed in 2020but last month Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he wanted to revive the idea ""as fast as possible"". How much nuclear power does the UK use? Boris Johnson defends energy strategy PM says Wylfa plant 'going to happen' Government delays decision on Sizewell C Investing in nuclear power is one of the key focuses of the government's energy strategy, released in April. The government plans to reduce the UK's reliance on oil and gas by investing in alternative sources of energy, including nuclear, wind and hydrogen power. This video can not be played Watch: Nuclear projects may affect bills - Kwasi Kwarteng exclusively tells the BBC The strategy contains an ambition to deliver up to eight new nuclear reactors before 2030, including two at Sizewell in Suffolk. The government wants nuclear to supply 24 gigawatts (GW) of electricity by 2050 - about 25% of the UK's predicted energy demand. Mr Kwarteng said he thought investing in nuclear was ""part of the solution"" to the UK's energy needs. He said ""nuclear is back on the table"" because it provides more decarbonised power and a sustainable energy source. But building new nuclear power plants can be vastly more expensive than renewables and can take decades to build. A new law means new nuclear reactors can be funded by adding a small levy to people's bills during their construction. Companies have previously pulled out of plans to build new nuclear reactors - including the one at Wylfa on Anglesey. These reactors take a lot of time and money to build, so the concern has often been around the financial risk. The government feel the way around this is to raise funds through levies on people's bills, so that risk is shared with the consumer. It argues it would only add a few pounds a year to energy bills during the construction phase. But the concern is many nuclear projects - such as Hinkley - have run well over their initial budget and timescale. Ministers say they want to place their ""big bet"" on nuclear but it's just part of the plan. They want to expand offshore wind farms, and North Sea oil and gas expansion. They have offered cheaper energy bills for people who live near new onshore wind farms - but not for nuclear. The government says this will lead to savings for consumers in the long run, as developers can have more money upfront, and are less likely to take out loans. But critics argue this shifts the risk of building new reactors on to the consumer, without knowing how long projects will take or how much they will cost. When asked whether putting bills up in the short term was worth the political gamble, Mr Kwarteng said: ""Absolutely. People here really want to see new investment, jobs, opportunity for their kids and their community."" The government's own public attitudes research,externalshows while 86% of people support renewable energy, public support is lower for nuclear energy (37%). Nuclear plants are extremely expensive to build, although the overall cost is comparable to other forms of power. Hinkley C - the newest of the UK's planned nuclear power stations - is expected to cost Â£22-26bn. When asked if he thought the public supported investment in nuclear, the business secretary suggested ""nuclear's more popular now than it's been for a while"". He said there were two reasons why people wanted to see more nuclear power - ""security of supply here in the UK"" and ""what experts call firm power"". ""What that means is, if you look at renewables the sun doesn't always shine, and the wind doesn't always blow,"" he said. ""The great thing about nuclear power is that it's continuous power."" In a community such as Wylfa, he said, ""there's actually broad public support"". ""Now the nuclear power won't be everywhere in the UK, it will only be on sites where there is a history, a tradition."" The government's plan for a new nuclear power station at Wylfa has split opinion among local people. Jo Fosbrook, a local holiday business owner, said she reluctantly accepted investing in nuclear power was necessary. ""You can't say that 'I don't want nuclear power', because what else are you going to have?"" she said. ""What are you going to say to everybody, have a candle on in the eve instead?"" But Emlyn Richards, a retired Methodist minister, was less keen on the idea, expressing a preference for renewable sources of energy. ""Anglesey is noted for its wind,"" he said. ""Why don't they harness that and turn it to power?"" He said Wylfa was the ""most beautiful spot on the island"". ""I don't want them to spoil that beauty for the generation that's coming after us,"" he added. This video can not be played Anglesey hasn't had a functional nuclear power station for nearly seven years, but is that about to change? As part of its plan, the government opened a Â£120m fund designed to stimulate the development of nuclear technologies on Friday. As well as large, traditional nuclear reactors, the government is also supporting the development of small nuclear reactors (SMRs), which are smaller and can be assembled in factories - making for a simpler construction project. Tom Samson, CEO of Rolls Royce SMR, which wants to build some in the UK, told the BBC the company hoped to finance its SMRs through a combination of private financing and government support. Mr Samson said: ""Generating electricity from nuclear is a much better way to keep consumers' costs as low as possible."" He added the government's model of funding nuclear projects, which can add levies to people's bills while they are in construction, would reduce the costs of delivering nuclear projects. ""We have to finance the build and we have to find ways to finance that build most economically,"" he said. Will the UK's energy strategy work? How 'green' and safe is nuclear power?

Half a million waiting for social care in England,"'He's our son - we will do what he needs,' says Tania Tillyer The number of adults waiting for social care in England has risen sharply to more than 500,000, according to estimates by social work bosses. Similar research last year put the figure at about 294,000, says the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services (Adass). ""We're seeing a devastating impact on people's lives,"" said Adass president Sarah McClinton. The government says reforming social care is a priority. Adass blames a growing shortage of care workers, made worse by low pay rates and the cost-of-living crisis. As the population ages, more and more people need social care, defined as help with day-to-day living in their own homes or in supported accommodation. Their needs are increasingly complex but capacity is not keeping pace, says Adass. Children's social care generates excessive profits - report Care workers lose out on Â£7,000 pay, charity says 'It takes a strong person to do this job' The care staffing crisis means ""even more pressure on even more families who are propping up a chronic shortage of services"", according to Helen Walker, chief executive of Carers UK. Tania Tillyer, from Northamptonshire, knows only too well how families are having to pick up the strain. Her 37-year-old son Lee, is quadriplegic and has complex special needs which mean he needs 24-hour care for help with most basic tasks, from changing his incontinence pads and feeding him, to managing his medication and hoisting him when he needs to change his position in bed. ""The majority of it is provided by me and his dad, Brian,"" says Tania. Tania says her own health issues mean the additional care work increases the pain she is in. ""When you're looking after someone 24 hours a day, your priority's them, not yourself... ""Over the years, it's impacted on me greatly, particularly on my back because of back pain that I have... but at the end of the day he's our son. So, you know, we will do what he needs."" Lee has funding from the NHS for three professional carers. One works four nights a week. Two others used to split the weekdays between them. But since one of the day carers got a better paid job five months ago, the family has been unable to find a replacement. The problem is money, says Tania - because the role is only funded up to Â£10 an hour, and no-one with the necessary skills has applied. ""Cleaners and shop workers and other people are actually getting a lot more money per hour, when actually this type of work requires a lot of sensitivity and a lot of skill,"" says Tania. ""If you're not paying the right wage, then people aren't going to want to apply."" In Cleveland, care worker Karen Taggart loves ""being able to change somebody's day and provide them with that little bit of independence that they still want to hold on to, and allow them to be with their families"". But she says poor pay, particularly as the cost of living spirals, puts off many potential recruits. ""People with families, trying to get on the housing ladder, just can't afford to be in a job like this and, as well, I think people have been told that it's really hard. It can be hard, but the rewards outweigh that."" Carer Karen Taggart (R) says the pay puts off some potential care workers Karen's boss, Michelle Jackson, managing director of Caremark Redcar and Cleveland, employs about 280 carers, supporting 570 people. Demand is ""very, very high"" at the moment, says Michelle. ""We constantly get emails from the council and requests for extra care packages. ""Past days we used to be able to take all of that work on and currently we can't,"" she says, estimating that they turn down 80% of new requests, whereas in the past they accepted almost all of them. ""We just can't get enough care workers in the industry."" The problem is low pay, but Caremark cannot put up wages and stay in business, says Michelle ""because we don't get enough money from the council"", and council budgets are in turn limited by what they receive from central government. The only solution is for the government ""to invest properly in homecare so we can build capacity and reduce unmet need"", argues Dr Jane Townson, chief executive of The Homecare Association. Adass's survey went to directors of adult social services in all of England's 152 councils, and 94 responded. The researchers extrapolated the numbers whose needs were not being met in those 94 councils, concluding that 506,131 people, across England, are waiting for: a social care assessment care to begin a review of their care Although 16% more hours of home care are being delivered across England, this is dwarfed by an almost sevenfold increase in hours that cannot be delivered, because of a shortage of care workers. In the first three months of this year, 170,000 hours of home care each week could not be delivered, the survey suggests. Ms McClinton said that althoughthe government's health and social care reformshelp a bit, they fall short in addressing the most pressing issues, ""how we respond to rapidly increasing unmet need for essential care and support, and resolve the workforce crisis by properly valuing care professionals"". ""We have not seen the bounceback in services after the pandemic in the way we had hoped. ""In fact the situation is getting worse rather than better."" Social care is 'far from fixed', says Adass president, Sarah McClinton In a statement, the Department of Health and Social Care said reforming adult social care was a priority for the government which was investing Â£5.4bn over three years from April, funded by the Health and Social Care Levy. ""This includes Â£3.6bn to reform the social care charging system and enable all local authorities to move towards paying providers a fair cost of care and a further Â£1.7bn to begin major improvements across adult social care in England,"" said an official.

"Russia threatens retaliation for Finland Nato moveFinland's leaders say they want the country to apply for membership of the alliance ""without delay"".","Finland has a 1,300km border with Russia Russia has said it will be forced to take ""retaliatory steps"" over its neighbour Finland's move to join Nato. A foreign ministry statement said the move would seriously damage bilateral relations, as well as security and stability in northern Europe. Earlier, Finland's president and PM called for the country to apply for Nato membership ""without delay"". It comes amid a surge in public support for Nato membership following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Finland shares a 1,300-km (810-mile) border with Russia. Until now, it has stayed out of Nato to avoid antagonising its eastern neighbour. Finland will formally announce its decision on Sunday after it has been considered by parliament and other senior political figures. Sweden has said it will announce a similar decision on the same day. Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has said he expects the process of giving Sweden and Finland membership to happen ""quite quickly"". The White House said the US would back a Nato application from both countries if they apply. Are Finland and Sweden going from neutral to Nato? What is Nato and could Finland and Sweden join? Is Nato's Nordic expansion a threat or boost to Europe? The Russian statement (in Russian),externaldescribed Finland's move as ""a radical change in the country's foreign policy"". ""Finland's accession to Nato will cause serious damage to bilateral Russian-Finnish relations and the maintaining of stability and security in the Northern European region,"" it said. ""Russia will be forced to take retaliatory steps, both of a military-technical and other nature, in order to neutralise the threats to its national security that arise from this."" However, Moscow has not specified what steps it plans to take. Russia's deputy UN representative Dmitry Polyansky said Sweden and Finland would become possible targets for Russia if they become Nato members, according to Russian news agency Ria. This video can not be played Watch: Pekka Haavisto tells the BBC that Russiaâs invasion was a turning point for Finland wanting to join Nato Russian officials were responding to a joint statement by Finnish President Sauli Niinisto and Prime Minister Sanna Marin, which said the two leaders expected a decision on Nato membership in the next few days. ""Nato membership would strengthen Finland's security,"" it said. ""As a member of Nato, Finland would strengthen the entire defence alliance. Finland must apply for Nato membership without delay."" Speaking to journalists later, Mr Niinisto responded to Russian concerns and blamed the move on Moscow's invasion. ""Joining Nato would not be against anyone. You caused this. Look in the mirror,"" he said. An opinion poll last week put support in Finland for joining Nato at 76%, with 12% against, a big swing towards membership since before the invasion. Finland and the USSR were on opposing sides in World War Two, with the Finns famously fending off a Soviet invasion in 1939-40. But Finland lost 10% of its territory in the final peace agreement and remained non-aligned throughout the Cold War. Its accession to Nato would more than double the length of Russia's borders with the alliance. Sweden does not have a border with Russia.

"Take-at-home oral tablet can treat womb growthsIt could help thousands of women avoid invasive surgery, experts advising the NHS say.","A new oral tablet could help thousands of women with benign womb growths, called fibroids, avoid invasive surgery, say experts advising the NHS. Watchdog the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) says Ryeqo pills should be added to the treatment options considered if a woman has moderate to severe symptoms. That includes heavy and painful periods. Sometimes, the growths and associated bloating make a woman look pregnant. They can also lead to infertility. Fibroids are really common - affecting one in three women, but particularly those who are black. Clara Amfo had fibroid surgery in February BBC Radio 1 DJ Clara Amfo has spoken openly about her experience of living with fibroids. She told Radio 1's Life Hacks:""A lot of people don't know what they are. So they are basically non-cancerous growths that can appear on the womb. ""The blessing is they are non-cancerous, which is a plus, but they still cause a lot of problems around fertility, enjoyment of sexy time, with your digestive system, with your urinary system, heavy periods. ""I developed anaemia because my periods were very heavy. I was losing a lot of blood because of them."" She recently had surgery to remove six large ones. ""I had what is called a laparoscopic myomectomy. That meant they made three incisions - they went through my belly button and made two incisions in my abdomen and then they go in with a machine, and they basically shred the fibroid in you and then like suck it out. ""The recovery was so tough. It was keyhole surgery but it was still invasive."" Heavy or painful periods Tummy (abdominal) pain Lower back pain Frequent need to urinate Constipation Pain or discomfort during sex Bloating Source: NHS,external Surgery may still be the best option for some women. There are also injections available that can shrink fibroids. Painkillers and hormonal birth control pills or coils are another option that may provide relief. Fibroids do not need to be treated if they are not causing symptoms. Over time, they will often shrink and disappear without treatment, particularly after the menopause. The Ryeqo tablets contain a combination of medication - relugolix with estradiol and norethisterone acetate - and are designed to be taken daily at home to help control symptoms. Research suggests they can be used in the long term and should not affect fertility. About 4,500 women with uterine fibroids will be eligible for a new oral treatment in England and Wales, says NICE, and it should become available within the next few months now that the guidance has been published. Helen Knight, interim director of medicines evaluation in the NICE Centre for Health Technology Evaluation, said: ""Uterine fibroids can have a profound effect on quality of life. Along with the many debilitating symptoms, there is a real lack of long-term options. ""This treatment has the potential to improve quality of life. As well as effectively reducing symptoms, it can be taken at home and is therefore more convenient than the injectable treatment, given in a hospital setting. ""It can also be used long term, which could mean improved and sustained symptom relief, it is well-tolerated, and it will mean thousands of women can avoid invasive surgery which always carries some risk.""

Elon Musk puts Twitter deal on hold,"Elon Musk has said his $44bn (Â£35bn) deal to buy Twitter is on hold after he queried the number of fake or spam accounts on the social media platform. He said he was waiting for information ""supporting [the] calculation that spam/fake accounts do indeed represent less than 5% of users"". Mr Muskadded later,externalthat he was ""still committed to [the] acquisition"". However, analysts speculated he could be seeking to renegotiate the price or even walk away from the takeover. Mr Musk's tweets sent Twitter's share price plunging 10% in morning trade in New York. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

You may want to readTwitterâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. Even before his comments, the company's stock had been selling for less than the $54.20 per share Mr Musk has offered, a sign that the markets were not convinced he would complete the buyout. Dan Ives, a tech analyst at investment firm Wedbush Securities, said Mr Musk's comments would ""send this Twitter circus show into a Friday the 13th horror show"". ""Many will view this as Musk using this Twitter filing/spam accounts as a way to get out of this deal in a vastly changing market,"" he wrote in a note. ""The nature of Musk creating so much uncertainty in a tweet (and not a filing) is very troubling to us... and now sends this whole deal into a circus show with many questions and no concrete answers as to the path of this deal going forward."" Mr Musk has been vocal about ""defeating the spam bots"", identifying it as a key goal following his planned takeover of the company. Twitter executives ousted ahead of Musk takeover How Elon Musk might change Twitter Twitter has long faced accusations of not doing enough to address automated, fake accounts posting content. In a filing more than two weeks ago, Twitter estimated that fake accounts accounted for fewer than 5% of its daily active users during the first three months of this year. It cautioned that the figures were based on estimates and could be higher. Those claims were not different from what the firm had shared in previous disclosures. The number of spam bots on the service is a key statistic, as a higher than expected figure could hurt the ability to grow advertising revenue or paid-for subscriptions, said Susannah Streeter, analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. But she said it was not clear how genuine Mr Musk's concerns were. ""There will also be questions raised over whether fake accounts are the real reason behind this delaying tactic, given that promoting free speech rather than focusing on wealth creation appeared to be his primary motivation for the takeover,"" she said. ""The $44bn price tag is huge, and it may be a strategy to row back on the amount he is prepared to pay to acquire the platform."" Weeks of market turmoil in the US have wiped billions off the value of many companies - including once favoured tech firms. Tesla, the electric car company where Mr Musk serves as chief executive, has also seen its shares plunge - a hit to Mr Musk, whose status as the world's richest person is bound up in his stake in the company and who had planned to rely on his shares to help finance the Twitter purchase. Last month, he raised $8.5bn by selling shares. He also planned to use the shares to secure $6.5bn in loans. After Mr Musk tweeted that the deal was temporarily on hold, Tesla's share price gained more than 5%. Another twist in the tale of Elon Musk's attempt to own Twitter. One of his priorities, he said, was to ""clean up"" the platform - weeding out the bots and spam accounts that he believes drag it down. Spend any time on it and you'll certainly see evidence of both. However, Twitter says that less than 5% of its active users are fake. So does that mean there is no diamond in the rough to be polished here, that what you see on Twitter is what you get after all? And if so, does that make it less valuable a proposition? It is of course also possible that his new hesitation stems from how he intends to finance the deal - he's already had to sell some of his valuable Tesla stock to raise funds, and that's had an impact on the car firm too. Mr Musk has some thinking to do. Mr Musk's latest move comes after an announcement that two Twitter executivesare leaving the social media company. Kayvon Beykpour, who led Twitter's consumer division, and Bruce Falck, who oversaw revenue, both tweeted on Thursday that the departures were not their decisions. From this week, the firm also said it had paused most hiring, except for ""business critical roles"".

"North Korea announces first death from Covid-19A day after confirming its first cases, state media reports thousands are suffering fever symptoms.Asia","North Korean leader Kim Jong Un appeared in a face mask on television for the first time on Thursday to order nationwide lockdowns North Korea has confirmed its first death from Covid-19, with state media adding that tens of thousands more are experiencing fever symptoms. Six people died after suffering a fever with one testing positive for Omicron, state media reported on Friday. It said 187,000 people with a fever were being ""isolated and treated"". While experts believe the virus has been present in the country for some time, the authorities only announced the first cases on Thursday. They said there had been an outbreak of the Omicron variant in the capital, Pyongyang, and announced lockdown measures. They did not give precise case numbers. But in an update on Friday, the official KCNA news agency reported that the outbreak extended beyond the capital. ""A fever whose cause couldn't be identified spread explosively nationwide from late April,"" it said. Around 350,000 people had shown signs of that fever, it added, without specifying how many had tested positive for Covid. An image released by state media showed officials - all wearing face masks - meeting Kim Jong-un to discuss Covid-19 Analysts suggest the latest figures from state media, including the acknowledgement that the unspecified fever had spread nationwide, may indicate the country is experiencing an outbreak unlike any it has seen so far. Its population of 25 million is vulnerable due to the lack of a vaccination programme and poor healthcare, experts say. Why doesn't North Korea have enough food? How dangerous is the situation in North Korea? North Korea rejected offers from the international community to supply millions of AstraZeneca and Chinese-made jabs last year. Instead, it claimed it had controlled Covid by sealing its borders early in January 2020. The country shares land borders with South Korea and China, which have both battled outbreaks. China is now struggling to contain an Omicron wave with lockdowns in its biggest cities. On Friday, KCNA reported that the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un had visited a healthcare centre and ""learned about the nationwide spread of Covid-19"". It described the situation as an ""immediate public health crisis"". These numbers give us the first indication that the virus has spread rapidly around the country, far beyond the capital Pyongyang. This puts the entire population of 25 million at risk. No-one is vaccinated, many are malnourished, and the health care system is poor. But the virus itself may not present the biggest danger. The lockdown could have devastating consequences for people. Food and medicine are already in short supply, thanks to efforts by authorities to keep the virus out - they've sealed the country's borders for more than two years, cutting off virtually all trade. We don't know yet how aggressive these lockdowns will be, and whether people will be confined to their homes. Kim Jong-un wants some work to continue. But it is very possible that the markets, where many earn a living, will be closed. It will also be more difficult for people to move around the country. This in turn will make it even harder for them to get hold of the food and supplies they need to survive. By publishing these figures today, some say North Korea is showing it might finally be willing to accept outside help. At a meeting outlining new Covid rules on Thursday, Mr Kim was seen wearing a face mask on television for what was believed to be the first time. He ordered ""maximum emergency"" virus controls, which appeared to include orders for local lockdowns and gathering restrictions in workplaces. There are fears a major outbreak could make it even more difficult for essential supplies to enter the country, worsening food shortages and a faltering economy. South Korea has said it offered humanitarian aid after Thursday's announcement, but Pyongyang is yet to respond. Despite North Korea's earlier claims that it had ""shining success"" in keeping out Covid, there have been signs throughout the pandemic of its possible presence in the country, including unconfirmed reports of cases and workers wearing hazmat suits.

DUP to block Stormont Speaker over NI Protocol,"Boris Johnson will visit Northern Ireland on Monday amid a power-sharing crisis sparked by rising tensions over post-Brexit trading arrangements, Sinn FÃ©in's Michelle O'Neill has said. It comes as the DUP blocked the election of a Speaker to a new assembly on Friday, meaning it cannot function. The DUP said its actions sent a ""clear message"" about its opposition to the NI Protocol. Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said the PM must ""outline what he intends to do"". Mr Johnson's visit coincides with increased speculation that the government is poised to introduce legislation to strip away parts of the Northern Ireland Protocol. The Democratic Unionist Party's move to block the election of a Speaker follows the assembly election on 5 May. The Northern Ireland Protocol, a part of the UK-EU Brexit deal which keeps Northern Ireland aligned with the EU single market for goods, places a trade border in the Irish Sea between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The protocol - now under fresh scrutiny following the election - was designed to ensure free trade could continue across the Irish land border, but it has been opposed by unionist politicians. Follow live: MLAs gather to elect Assembly Speaker What is the Northern Ireland Protocol? Last week's vote cemented a majority for assembly members who accept the protocol, including the new largest party, the republican party Sinn FÃ©in. Most politicians elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly want the protocol to remain Its vice-president, Michelle O'Neill, who is entitled to be Northern Ireland's next first minister, said the DUP had failed on day one of the new assembly. ""There is no reason why we should be in a rolling crisis for even one second,"" Ms O'Neill told the chamber. Speaking to press in the Great Hall following the sitting, Ms O'Neill claimed that the DUP had ""punished the public"" for its own selfish interest. ""That isn't tolerable, it isn't acceptable , it isn't good enough"", she added. The UK government has said itwants to override parts of the treaty it signed in 2020, but Sir Jeffrey said it would ""not be words that determine how we [the DUP] proceed, it will be actions"". The DUP, now the second-largest party by seats, said it would not nominate ministers to Stormont's governing executive until its concerns about the protocol were resolved. Its decision to also not elect a Speaker - a move which requires cross community support - means that there can be no debates in the assembly, no committees can be held, and the actions of ministers, currently acting in a caretaker capacity, cannot be scrutinised. The Northern Ireland Executive cannot meet without a first and deputy first minister as the roles are joint and one cannot exist without the other. The executive collapsed in February when the DUP First Minister Paul Givan resigned in protest over the protocol, meaning the deputy first minister had to leave their post as well. Other ministers who were in office at that time can continue in a caretaker fashion but their powers are limited. This video can not be played 'We can proceed no further without a Speaker' - Maskey Mr Givan told MLAs on Friday that his party was respecting its mandate to ""remove the Irish Sea border"". ""Our message is now clear - it is time for action, words will no longer suffice,"" he said. Mr Givan added that his party had been patient and reasonable in its demands for progress in the UK-EU talks on the protocol. Earlier, Sir Jeffrey said his party needed to ""send a very clear message to the European Union and to our government that we are serious about getting this protocol sorted out"". ""Because of the harm it is doing, undermining political stability, damaging agreements, harming our economy, contributing to the cost of living crisis, this matter needs to be dealt with,"" he added. Sir Jeffrey has argued the protocol has eroded the foundations ""devolution has been built upon"" and undermined Northern Ireland's position in the UK. DUP threatens to stop assembly functioning What do voters think of the NI Protocol? UK rejects EU plans to deal with NI Protocol A simple guide to the Brexit border problem How PM's views on Northern Ireland deal changed Without a Speaker we have a ""silent assembly"". It was one of the few moves left open to the DUP to try and apply pressure. In other words, the party is saying to London and Brussels you can have the protocol or Stormont - but you can't have both. This is a big gamble for the DUP in the hope there will be movement on the protocol to allow the party to return to Stormont. What if there is no change? How long will the party stay away from the assembly and the executive? How will the public react? What of the fact that a majority of MLAs support the protocol and does this look like the DUP are holding people to ransom? This is the DUP moving things up a gear. Read morehere. NI Secretary Brandon Lewis said he was disappointed by the DUP's move, tweeting that Northern Ireland deserved a stable and accountable devolved government. Ms O'Neill said that when she meets Mr Johnson on Monday, she will tell him ""that he needs to stop pandering to the DUP, that they need to get on and work with the [European] Commission and find ways to smooth the implementation of the protocol and stop holding us to ransom for their game playing"". Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) MicheÃ¡l Martin said the EU had been flexible in its approach to the negotiations with the UK government, but this had not been reciprocated. ""There are issues that unionism have raised with us in respect of the protocol, but those issues should not prevent the establishment of the assembly,"" he added. Alliance Party leader Naomi Long said parties who believe in devolution ""do not gamble with it"". ""Many of us in this chamber represent people who did not consent to Brexit in the first place and yet we turned up for work,"" she said. Mrs Long later said it was a ""shameful day"" for the DUP. ""The DUP came to Stormont, signed the register, took their salaries but refused to take their seats and do the work to earn it,"" she said. Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader Doug Beattie said without a functioning assembly there would be ""silence"" as people deal with the cost of living crisis and die on hospital waiting lists. ""People will be desperately calling for an ambulance and from this place there will be silence,"" he said. Matthew O'Toole, of the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP), accused the DUP of having ""thwarted and demeaned"" democracy. However, Jim Allister, the Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) leader, said the protocol was causing ""pain"" and it was not the right time to appoint a Speaker. Meanwhile, Sinn FÃ©in's John O'Dowd will become the new infrastructure minister. He will replace Nichola Mallon of the SDLP after she failed to gain re-election to the assembly last week.

Twitter executives ousted ahead of Musk takeover,"Twitter has confirmed that two of its bosses are leaving the social media company in one of the biggest shake-ups since Elon Musk agreed to buy the firm. The executives had been leading Twitter's consumer and revenue operations. From this week, the firm has also paused most hiring, except for ""business critical roles"". The move comes as the multi-billionaire Tesla boss moves ahead with a $44bn (Â£36bn) takeover of the platform. ""We are pulling back on non-labour costs to ensure we are being responsible and efficient,"" a Twitter spokesperson told the BBC. Kayvon Beykpour, who led Twitter's consumer division, and Bruce Falck, who oversaw revenue, both tweeted on Thursday that the departures were not their decisions. Mr Beykpour said that he is currently on paternity leave and was disappointed after being asked to leave by Mr Parag, who ""wants to take the team in a different direction"". Allow Twitter content?

Appearing at an event on Tuesday he said: ""I would reverse the permanent ban but I don't own Twitter yet so this is not a thing that will definitely happen."" On Thursday, he tweeted: ""Even though I think a less divisive candidate would be better in 2024, I still think Trump should be restored to Twitter."" Mr Trump has said that he does not want to return to Twitter, but instead aims to build up his own Truth Social platform. He was banned from Twitter permanentlyin January 2021 because of the ""risk of further incitement of violence"" following the storming of the US Capitol, the company said then.

Take-at-home oral tablet can treat womb growths,"A new oral tablet could help thousands of women with benign womb growths, called fibroids, avoid invasive surgery, say experts advising the NHS. Watchdog the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) says Ryeqo pills should be added to the treatment options considered if a woman has moderate to severe symptoms. That includes heavy and painful periods. Sometimes, the growths and associated bloating make a woman look pregnant. They can also lead to infertility. Fibroids are really common - affecting one in three women, but particularly those who are black. Clara Amfo had fibroid surgery in February BBC Radio 1 DJ Clara Amfo has spoken openly about her experience of living with fibroids. She told Radio 1's Life Hacks:""A lot of people don't know what they are. So they are basically non-cancerous growths that can appear on the womb. ""The blessing is they are non-cancerous, which is a plus, but they still cause a lot of problems around fertility, enjoyment of sexy time, with your digestive system, with your urinary system, heavy periods. ""I developed anaemia because my periods were very heavy. I was losing a lot of blood because of them."" She recently had surgery to remove six large ones. ""I had what is called a laparoscopic myomectomy. That meant they made three incisions - they went through my belly button and made two incisions in my abdomen and then they go in with a machine, and they basically shred the fibroid in you and then like suck it out. ""The recovery was so tough. It was keyhole surgery but it was still invasive."" Heavy or painful periods Tummy (abdominal) pain Lower back pain Frequent need to urinate Constipation Pain or discomfort during sex Bloating Source: NHS,external Surgery may still be the best option for some women. There are also injections available that can shrink fibroids. Painkillers and hormonal birth control pills or coils are another option that may provide relief. Fibroids do not need to be treated if they are not causing symptoms. Over time, they will often shrink and disappear without treatment, particularly after the menopause. The Ryeqo tablets contain a combination of medication - relugolix with estradiol and norethisterone acetate - and are designed to be taken daily at home to help control symptoms. Research suggests they can be used in the long term and should not affect fertility. About 4,500 women with uterine fibroids will be eligible for a new oral treatment in England and Wales, says NICE, and it should become available within the next few months now that the guidance has been published. Helen Knight, interim director of medicines evaluation in the NICE Centre for Health Technology Evaluation, said: ""Uterine fibroids can have a profound effect on quality of life. Along with the many debilitating symptoms, there is a real lack of long-term options. ""This treatment has the potential to improve quality of life. As well as effectively reducing symptoms, it can be taken at home and is therefore more convenient than the injectable treatment, given in a hospital setting. ""It can also be used long term, which could mean improved and sustained symptom relief, it is well-tolerated, and it will mean thousands of women can avoid invasive surgery which always carries some risk.""

PSNI apologises to family of murdered GAA official,"Sean Brown was abducted from the grounds of Bellaghy Wolfe Tones GAC in 1997 The PSNI has paid an undisclosed sum to the family of a GAA official murdered by loyalists in 1997 and apologised over inadequacies in the original investigation. Sean Brown, 61, was abducted in Bellaghy, County Londonderry and shot near Randalstown, County Antrim. He was locking the gates of GAA club Bellaghy Wolfe Tones when he was taken by the Loyalist Volunteer Force (LVF). No-one has ever been convicted of the murder. It is 25 years to the day since Mr Brown was killed. Sean Brown's body was found in a burnt-out car near Randalstown A statement agreed between Mr Brown's family and the PSNI was read out in court, in which the victim was described as a ""devoted family man and a pillar of the Bellaghy community"". It added that the PSNI ""continues to engage fully in the ongoing inquest proceedings"". The Brown family's solicitor Niall Murphy, speaking outside court after the PSNI settlement, said: ""This family should never have had to take litigation to extract a semblance of accountability and all it is is an apology."" He added that while it was welcome, it ""should never have been the case, there should have been an adequate, full, exhaustive investigation at the appropriate time"". The apology, along with an undisclosed financial settlement, brings the long-running legal action brought by Mr Brown's widow to an end. It had been her case that the police had protected the LVF killers and that this was reflected in a sub-standard investigation conducted by the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC). The RUC was the police force at the time of Mr Brown's murder. It was reformed and renamed as the PSNI in 2001. Speaking outside the court, Mr Brown's grandson Damon Brown said it was a day of ""mixed emotions"" and described the settlement as ""a step"", after a terrible 25 years of struggle. Sean Brown's family said the PSNI apology and financial settlement was a step toward getting the answers they need ""It's one step forward instead of ten steps back,"" he said. ""Hopefully the inquest will bring the answers we need."" The coroner's inquest has been consistently delayed due to several issues, including thedisclosure of documents. The Brown family have been campaigning for years, during which time there have been a number of reports criticising the RUC's investigation into the killing. In 2004, the then Police Ombudsman Nuala O'Loan said an investigation by the RUC into Mr Brown's murder was ""incomplete and inadequate"". It said the investigation had not been ""efficiently and property carried out"" and that ""no earnest effort was made to identify those who had carried out the murder"". Mr Brown's murder was then re-examined by the now defunct Historical Enquiries Team, which was also critical of the RUC investigation. Sean Brown's son Damian, who campaigned for justice for his father, died in October 2021 In 2015, it emerged during the inquest thatrelevant classified material was lost and redactions, including the blanking out of names, on 34 folders of non-sensitive material had not been completed by the PSNI. Despite delays the family's solicitor Niall Murphy said the inquest will take place and has been scheduled. He also paid tribute to Sean Brown's son, Damian Brown, who had attended every day of the inquest hearings. He died in October 2021 after a short illness. ""There was 34 preliminary hearings, often days of frustration, often days where he left insulted, but he came back every single day."" Mr Murphy said. ""Whilst today is welcome, it is bittersweet that Damian isn't here."" He added: ""Today is a validation of all of his perseverance to preserve the integrity of his father's memory."" A tree was planted at Bellaghy Bawn on Thursday evening to commemorate the anniversary of Mr Brown's death The 25th anniversary of Sean Brown's death will be commemorated by his club Bellaghy Wolfe Tones with a number of events. This included the planting of a tree and unveiling of a stone plaque, inscribed with the poem ""The Augean Stables"" written by the late Seamus Heaney after hearing about his death, at Bellaghy Bawn, on Thursday evening by the GAA's (Gaelic Athletic Association) president Larry McCarthy. The poem was also read aloud by actor Stephen Rea to those in attendance including the GAA official's widow Bridie Brown.

DUP to wait for UK Brexit plan before Stormont move,"Sammy Wilson said the DUP would not be in the executive to implement the Northern Ireland Protocol The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) will wait to hear the government's proposals on post-Brexit trading arrangements before it decides to re-enter the Northern Ireland Executive, the party's MP Sammy Wilson has said. Mr Wilson added he hoped difficulties could be resolved by the end of 2022. He argued the Northern Ireland Protocol had undermined NI's place in the UK. On Thursday, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said the UK would actif the EU did not show flexibility. It comes after the UK attorney general said it would be lawful for the government to override parts of the agreement. This was a change to previous advice because, the office said, the protocol had caused social unrest. This part of the UK-EU Brexit agreement keeps Northern Ireland aligned with the EU single market for goods. It was a move designed to allow the continuation of free trade across the Irish border, however, it has resulted in some additional checks being placed on goods moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. Most politicians elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly want the protocol to remain The new legal advice comes after ahoax bomb attack which targeted Ireland's foreign affairs ministerin Belfast two months ago. Mr Wilson told BBC News NI's Good Morning Ulster programme that the protocol had been implemented ""in the most petty and draconian way by the EU"" as a means to teach the UK a lesson. ""Being inside the executive would require us to implement the agreement and the Northern Ireland Protocol, something which we believe damages our constitutional position, removes the democratic decisions from Stormont and is damaging our economy,"" he said on Thursday. In February, the DUP, which campaigned for Brexit,withdrew Paul Givan as first ministerin protest against the protocol, resulting in the collapse of Stormont's governing executive. Since last week's assembly election, in which Sinn FÃ©in became the largest party, the DUP has said it will not nominate ministers to re-establish the executive. It has also hinted that it may block the nomination of an assembly Speaker, a move which would prevent the functioning of the assembly. DUP threatens to stop assembly functioning A simple guide to the Brexit border problem The DUP's backing is vital - it is the largest unionist party and a speaker can only be elected with cross-community support. Sinn FÃ©in vice-president Michelle O'Neill is in line to be Northern Ireland's first minister after last week's election Sinn FÃ©in deputy Michelle O'Neill said it would be incredulous for the DUP to block the election of a Speaker. ""I don't think that's acceptable when they've just been before the electorate and the people have voted to have politics working for them,"" she continued. Neale Richmond, a member of the DÃ¡il (lower house of Irish parliament) and the Fine Gael party's European affairs spokesperson, said reports the UK could override the protocol agreement would be a ""petty stunt that won't achieve anything"". ""The people who pushed Brexit the hardest have said no to every solution to a mess they've created themselves,"" he told Good Morning Ulster. ""Instead what we have is the DUP and the British government absolutely ratcheting up tensions when the EU throughout this process have looked through the implementation process to produce actual real solutions."" Mr Wilson said his party was committed to devolution and wanted the institutions up and running as soon as possible. ""We want to make sure that devolution is done on the basis of parties and their views being treated with respect and that the consent principle is in place,"" he said. Anti-protocol graffiti has been displayed in a number of unionist areas since the Brexit deal was signed Mr Wilson accused Mr Richmond of using ""honeyed"" words in his description of the protocol. Earlier this week,the UK rejected EU plans aimed at reducing paperwork and checks on goods. It said they had the potential to ""worsen the current trading arrangements"". Northern Ireland Office Minister Conor Burns said the government had asked EU to widen the mandate for its chief negotiator MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ so the parties could ""land a negotiated position"". ""If it comes to the point where that is going to be impossible then clearly we will have to take decisions and actions to protect the peace, the power sharing, the institutions born out of the Good Friday Agreement, but we're not at that point yet,"" he added. Stephen Kelly from Manufacturing NI said the consensus among business owners in Northern Ireland was that the protocol was working for them. ""There are issues in terms of complexity, that comes with a bit of cost, but actually in the round, the protocol works very well for them,"" he told BBC Radio Foyle's Breakfast programme. ""They want to see amendments and adjustments, but in a pragmatic way. ""On the face of it this is about trade, but it's not, it's all about politics, stuff that's not relevant to business.""

Thousands sign up to count plastic waste for a week,"Thousands of people will count their plastic waste for a week in a national survey of how much we consume. The count, put together by the organisation Everyday Plastic and Greenpeace, starts on Monday. Only the US uses more plastic per person per year than the UK,research suggests.,external Campaigners say the count will shed a unique light on how households consume the environmentally damaging material. Huge amounts of energy and fossil fuels are needed to make new plastic, and it sticks around in our environment for a long time. It is also only possible to recycle plastic two or three times before it becomes too degraded. Microplastics have been found everywhere fromhuman blood,externaltoArctic snow. Around 151,000 households, 96 MPs, and 4,180 classrooms will be tallying up each piece of plastic they use from 16-22 May. Government figures suggest that UK householdsrecycled 44% of their waste in 2020,external. But some plastics put in recycling bins goes to landfill or incinerators, or is even sent abroad where it can be dumped instead. In 2020 BBC News uncovered mountains ofplastic waste sent from the UK to Turkey. ""This count is the UK's biggest ever investigation of plastics. Millions of us do our part to recycle but we don't really know where our plastic waste ends up,"" Greenpeace plastics campaigner Chris Thorne told BBC News. Everyday Plastic founder Daniel Webb counted his plastic for a year in 2017, filling 40 bin bags with waste. ""This experience changed my life and changed how I understood the problem. Then I thought, what if other people did the same experiment as I did?"" he told BBC News. Green light for 'historic' plastics treaty Why plastic recycling is so confusing Recycling plastic does not work - Boris Johnson Participants in the Big Plastic Count receive a pack explaining how to count the plastics they use, broken down into 19 categories. They then tally up each type of plastic waste before putting it in the bin or the recycling. The data will be analysed by Everyday Plastic and Greenpeace to produce a national picture of plastic waste. The campaigners say radical action by government and supermarkets is required to reduce how much plastic is produced and to improve recycling rates. Maria Hughes, who lives in Newport, Wales with her husband and two children, said she is taking part because she feels we are ""drowning in plastic"". ""I can't achieve the change needed alone. Ultimately we need manufacturers and supermarkets to change the packaging our food is in,"" she told BBC News. Nadiya Catel-Arutyunova, Sustainability Policy Advisor at the British Retail Consortium, told BBC News: ""Retailers have been committed to removing single-use packaging for some time. Many have signed up to the Plastics Pact, working with suppliers to eliminate problematic or unnecessary single-use plastic packaging. UK supermarkets are also investing in their reuse/refill offerings to radically cut down on packaging.""

Swinney - I only gave budget approval in ferry deal,"John Swinney should address parliament immediately, Mr Ross said John Swinney has said he only gave budget approval for the Scottish government's troubled ferries contract with Ferguson Marine. A spokesman for Nicola Sturgeon said he was not aware of the financial risks. The deputy first minister spoke to journalists after First Minister's Questions following calls from the Scottish Conservatives to ""come clean"". They claimed anewly published emailconfirmed Mr Swinney approved the ferry contract. Mr Swinney said he did not approve all contracts while he was finance secretary and there would be ""significant inefficiency"" if the government operated in such a way. In 2015, Ferguson Marine was given a publicly-funded contract to build two new ferries at its Port Glasgow yard. However, the vessels are yet to be finished and will cost in excess of Â£250m, tens of millions more than the original Â£97m price tag. Government says missing ferry deal document found Ferries deal awarded without financial safeguards Sturgeon: Buck stops with me over ferry deal It emerged on Wednesday that an email had been found that showed that the then Transport Minister Derek Mackay had approved the contract. The same email also copied in Mr Swinney who was the finance secretary at the time. The email trail shows a finance official asking for the award to be delayed until Mr Swinney could be briefed. Another civil servant asked for confirmation there were no ""banana skins"" after Mr Swinney was informed of the parameters of the deal - which ferry procurement body Caledonian Maritime Assets Limited had raised concerns about after Ferguson Marine said it could not offer a full builder's guarantee. In the final email in the trail, the finance official said: ""Just finished my call with Deputy First Minister (Mr Swinney). ""He now understands the background and that Mr McKay (sic) has cleared the proposal. So the way is clear to award."" Mr Swinney addressed media on Thursday. He said: ""As finance secretary at the time, I'm responsible for providing the budget for the meeting of any contracts. ""What officials were doing was briefing me that there was no need to change the budget arrangements based on the contract that had been agreed and approved by the transport portfolio, and which of course is confirmed by the email trail you got yesterday."" Asked if he gave it the nod, Mr Swinney said: ""What I gave was the budget approval, which I had given in August. ""And the budget approval I gave in August of 2015, the officials assured me on 9 October did not need to be changed. ""The finance secretary does not approve all contracts, if that was the case there would be significant inefficiency in the processing of contracts within government."" Responding to another question, he said: ""I didn't give it the final nod. ""I was given assurance that the budget provision that I had put in place in August was adequate for the contractual arrangements."" Earlier at First Minister's Questions, Mr Ross quizzed Ms Sturgeon about her deputy's role in the matter. The first minister reiterated that it was Derek Mackay who took the decision, the basis of which was set out in paperwork on 8 October 2015. Mr Ross added: ""It's very clear in here how officials escalated to John Swinney, waiting for his green light. ""In these emails, civil servants state that the deputy first minister confirmed the 'absence of banana skins'. ""John Swinney couldn't find a single banana skin, when they were absolutely littered around him - there were more banana skins in this project than there are in the monkey house at Edinburgh Zoo. ""We now know all of this, but what we don't know is why the deputy first minister ignored all those banana skins. ""The most crucial document in this affair is still missing - the one that explains why John Swinney charged ahead against expert advice."" A document released by the government revealed redacted information when copied and pasted into a Word document, Mr Ross told parliament. One of the redacted sections stated: ""The impact of a successful legal challenge could be high - in the worst case the contract could be declared ineffective."" ""The stench of corruption and cover up is running through this whole sorry affair,"" Mr Ross added. Ms Sturgeon accused Mr Ross of selectively quoting from the email which showed Derek Mackay made the decision. ""The deputy first minister did not take the decision, he wasn't even copied in to the advice of the 8th of October that was the basis of that decision,"" Ms Sturgeon said. ""He was simply briefed on the decision after it was taken, not even at his request but on the initiative of an official."" She pointed it out it was not unusual for finance minsters to be briefed on decisions that involved spending. ""It does not mean that the finance minster has taken the decision,"" she added. The Scottish Conservatives previously accused the government of orchestrating a campaign to try to pin the blame on Mr Mackay - who resigned as the country's finance secretary in 2020 after sending inappropriate messages to a 16-year-old boy on social media. Willie Rennie MSP, Scottish Liberal Democrat economy spokesman, called for a public inquiry. ""At least the amateurism of the SNP has enabled us to establish that ministers were advised that the ferries contract was potentially unlawful,"" he said. ""That multi-million pound contracts are routinely signed off by one-line emails even when there is a legal risk reveals a causal disregard for the public purse and the jobs and livelihoods of thousands of people. ""This confirmation now makes it inevitable that there must be a public inquiry into this shocking waste of public funds and failure to deliver two lifeline ferries.""

Half a million waiting for social care in EnglandSocial work bosses say a worsening shortage of care workers means they cannot meet demands for care.UK,"'He's our son - we will do what he needs,' says Tania Tillyer The number of adults waiting for social care in England has risen sharply to more than 500,000, according to estimates by social work bosses. Similar research last year put the figure at about 294,000, says the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services (Adass). ""We're seeing a devastating impact on people's lives,"" said Adass president Sarah McClinton. The government says reforming social care is a priority. Adass blames a growing shortage of care workers, made worse by low pay rates and the cost-of-living crisis. As the population ages, more and more people need social care, defined as help with day-to-day living in their own homes or in supported accommodation. Their needs are increasingly complex but capacity is not keeping pace, says Adass. Children's social care generates excessive profits - report Care workers lose out on Â£7,000 pay, charity says 'It takes a strong person to do this job' The care staffing crisis means ""even more pressure on even more families who are propping up a chronic shortage of services"", according to Helen Walker, chief executive of Carers UK. Tania Tillyer, from Northamptonshire, knows only too well how families are having to pick up the strain. Her 37-year-old son Lee, is quadriplegic and has complex special needs which mean he needs 24-hour care for help with most basic tasks, from changing his incontinence pads and feeding him, to managing his medication and hoisting him when he needs to change his position in bed. ""The majority of it is provided by me and his dad, Brian,"" says Tania. Tania says her own health issues mean the additional care work increases the pain she is in. ""When you're looking after someone 24 hours a day, your priority's them, not yourself... ""Over the years, it's impacted on me greatly, particularly on my back because of back pain that I have... but at the end of the day he's our son. So, you know, we will do what he needs."" Lee has funding from the NHS for three professional carers. One works four nights a week. Two others used to split the weekdays between them. But since one of the day carers got a better paid job five months ago, the family has been unable to find a replacement. The problem is money, says Tania - because the role is only funded up to Â£10 an hour, and no-one with the necessary skills has applied. ""Cleaners and shop workers and other people are actually getting a lot more money per hour, when actually this type of work requires a lot of sensitivity and a lot of skill,"" says Tania. ""If you're not paying the right wage, then people aren't going to want to apply."" In Cleveland, care worker Karen Taggart loves ""being able to change somebody's day and provide them with that little bit of independence that they still want to hold on to, and allow them to be with their families"". But she says poor pay, particularly as the cost of living spirals, puts off many potential recruits. ""People with families, trying to get on the housing ladder, just can't afford to be in a job like this and, as well, I think people have been told that it's really hard. It can be hard, but the rewards outweigh that."" Carer Karen Taggart (R) says the pay puts off some potential care workers Karen's boss, Michelle Jackson, managing director of Caremark Redcar and Cleveland, employs about 280 carers, supporting 570 people. Demand is ""very, very high"" at the moment, says Michelle. ""We constantly get emails from the council and requests for extra care packages. ""Past days we used to be able to take all of that work on and currently we can't,"" she says, estimating that they turn down 80% of new requests, whereas in the past they accepted almost all of them. ""We just can't get enough care workers in the industry."" The problem is low pay, but Caremark cannot put up wages and stay in business, says Michelle ""because we don't get enough money from the council"", and council budgets are in turn limited by what they receive from central government. The only solution is for the government ""to invest properly in homecare so we can build capacity and reduce unmet need"", argues Dr Jane Townson, chief executive of The Homecare Association. Adass's survey went to directors of adult social services in all of England's 152 councils, and 94 responded. The researchers extrapolated the numbers whose needs were not being met in those 94 councils, concluding that 506,131 people, across England, are waiting for: a social care assessment care to begin a review of their care Although 16% more hours of home care are being delivered across England, this is dwarfed by an almost sevenfold increase in hours that cannot be delivered, because of a shortage of care workers. In the first three months of this year, 170,000 hours of home care each week could not be delivered, the survey suggests. Ms McClinton said that althoughthe government's health and social care reformshelp a bit, they fall short in addressing the most pressing issues, ""how we respond to rapidly increasing unmet need for essential care and support, and resolve the workforce crisis by properly valuing care professionals"". ""We have not seen the bounceback in services after the pandemic in the way we had hoped. ""In fact the situation is getting worse rather than better."" Social care is 'far from fixed', says Adass president, Sarah McClinton In a statement, the Department of Health and Social Care said reforming adult social care was a priority for the government which was investing Â£5.4bn over three years from April, funded by the Health and Social Care Levy. ""This includes Â£3.6bn to reform the social care charging system and enable all local authorities to move towards paying providers a fair cost of care and a further Â£1.7bn to begin major improvements across adult social care in England,"" said an official.

"Take-at-home oral tablet can treat womb growthsIt could help thousands of women avoid invasive surgery, experts advising the NHS say.Health","A new oral tablet could help thousands of women with benign womb growths, called fibroids, avoid invasive surgery, say experts advising the NHS. Watchdog the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) says Ryeqo pills should be added to the treatment options considered if a woman has moderate to severe symptoms. That includes heavy and painful periods. Sometimes, the growths and associated bloating make a woman look pregnant. They can also lead to infertility. Fibroids are really common - affecting one in three women, but particularly those who are black. Clara Amfo had fibroid surgery in February BBC Radio 1 DJ Clara Amfo has spoken openly about her experience of living with fibroids. She told Radio 1's Life Hacks:""A lot of people don't know what they are. So they are basically non-cancerous growths that can appear on the womb. ""The blessing is they are non-cancerous, which is a plus, but they still cause a lot of problems around fertility, enjoyment of sexy time, with your digestive system, with your urinary system, heavy periods. ""I developed anaemia because my periods were very heavy. I was losing a lot of blood because of them."" She recently had surgery to remove six large ones. ""I had what is called a laparoscopic myomectomy. That meant they made three incisions - they went through my belly button and made two incisions in my abdomen and then they go in with a machine, and they basically shred the fibroid in you and then like suck it out. ""The recovery was so tough. It was keyhole surgery but it was still invasive."" Heavy or painful periods Tummy (abdominal) pain Lower back pain Frequent need to urinate Constipation Pain or discomfort during sex Bloating Source: NHS,external Surgery may still be the best option for some women. There are also injections available that can shrink fibroids. Painkillers and hormonal birth control pills or coils are another option that may provide relief. Fibroids do not need to be treated if they are not causing symptoms. Over time, they will often shrink and disappear without treatment, particularly after the menopause. The Ryeqo tablets contain a combination of medication - relugolix with estradiol and norethisterone acetate - and are designed to be taken daily at home to help control symptoms. Research suggests they can be used in the long term and should not affect fertility. About 4,500 women with uterine fibroids will be eligible for a new oral treatment in England and Wales, says NICE, and it should become available within the next few months now that the guidance has been published. Helen Knight, interim director of medicines evaluation in the NICE Centre for Health Technology Evaluation, said: ""Uterine fibroids can have a profound effect on quality of life. Along with the many debilitating symptoms, there is a real lack of long-term options. ""This treatment has the potential to improve quality of life. As well as effectively reducing symptoms, it can be taken at home and is therefore more convenient than the injectable treatment, given in a hospital setting. ""It can also be used long term, which could mean improved and sustained symptom relief, it is well-tolerated, and it will mean thousands of women can avoid invasive surgery which always carries some risk.""

"Big C podcaster Deborah James gets a damehoodThe podcast host, who is receiving end-of-life care for cancer, said she was ""blown away"" by the honour.UK","This video can not be played Watch: Deborah James ""can't really do anything more"" to fight cancer Podcast host Deborah James has been honoured with a damehood just days after revealing she is receiving end-of-life care for her bowel cancer. The mother-of-two has raised more than Â£4m since Monday, when she launched a fund for others with cancer after announcing she had stopped treatment. The host of theBBC's You, Me and the Big C podcastsaid she was ""blown away and crying"" at being made a dame. Dame Deborah, 40, is now being cared for at her parents' home.

But, in exceptional circumstances, some are announced at other times of the year - as happened with Captain Sir Tom Moore's knighthood. Downing Street confirmed the granting of the honour in a press release, which said: ""The Queen has been pleased to approve that the honour of Damehood be conferred upon Deborah James."" Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: ""If ever an honour was richly deserved, this is it. Deborah has been an inspiration and her honesty, warmth and courage has been a source of strength to so many people.

"PSNI apologises to family of murdered GAA officialThe police also pay an undisclosed sum to the family of Sean Brown, who was killed 25 years ago.Northern Ireland","Sean Brown was abducted from the grounds of Bellaghy Wolfe Tones GAC in 1997 The PSNI has paid an undisclosed sum to the family of a GAA official murdered by loyalists in 1997 and apologised over inadequacies in the original investigation. Sean Brown, 61, was abducted in Bellaghy, County Londonderry and shot near Randalstown, County Antrim. He was locking the gates of GAA club Bellaghy Wolfe Tones when he was taken by the Loyalist Volunteer Force (LVF). No-one has ever been convicted of the murder. It is 25 years to the day since Mr Brown was killed. Sean Brown's body was found in a burnt-out car near Randalstown A statement agreed between Mr Brown's family and the PSNI was read out in court, in which the victim was described as a ""devoted family man and a pillar of the Bellaghy community"". It added that the PSNI ""continues to engage fully in the ongoing inquest proceedings"". The Brown family's solicitor Niall Murphy, speaking outside court after the PSNI settlement, said: ""This family should never have had to take litigation to extract a semblance of accountability and all it is is an apology."" He added that while it was welcome, it ""should never have been the case, there should have been an adequate, full, exhaustive investigation at the appropriate time"". The apology, along with an undisclosed financial settlement, brings the long-running legal action brought by Mr Brown's widow to an end. It had been her case that the police had protected the LVF killers and that this was reflected in a sub-standard investigation conducted by the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC). The RUC was the police force at the time of Mr Brown's murder. It was reformed and renamed as the PSNI in 2001. Speaking outside the court, Mr Brown's grandson Damon Brown said it was a day of ""mixed emotions"" and described the settlement as ""a step"", after a terrible 25 years of struggle. Sean Brown's family said the PSNI apology and financial settlement was a step toward getting the answers they need ""It's one step forward instead of ten steps back,"" he said. ""Hopefully the inquest will bring the answers we need."" The coroner's inquest has been consistently delayed due to several issues, including thedisclosure of documents. The Brown family have been campaigning for years, during which time there have been a number of reports criticising the RUC's investigation into the killing. In 2004, the then Police Ombudsman Nuala O'Loan said an investigation by the RUC into Mr Brown's murder was ""incomplete and inadequate"". It said the investigation had not been ""efficiently and property carried out"" and that ""no earnest effort was made to identify those who had carried out the murder"". Mr Brown's murder was then re-examined by the now defunct Historical Enquiries Team, which was also critical of the RUC investigation. Sean Brown's son Damian, who campaigned for justice for his father, died in October 2021 In 2015, it emerged during the inquest thatrelevant classified material was lost and redactions, including the blanking out of names, on 34 folders of non-sensitive material had not been completed by the PSNI. Despite delays the family's solicitor Niall Murphy said the inquest will take place and has been scheduled. He also paid tribute to Sean Brown's son, Damian Brown, who had attended every day of the inquest hearings. He died in October 2021 after a short illness. ""There was 34 preliminary hearings, often days of frustration, often days where he left insulted, but he came back every single day."" Mr Murphy said. ""Whilst today is welcome, it is bittersweet that Damian isn't here."" He added: ""Today is a validation of all of his perseverance to preserve the integrity of his father's memory."" A tree was planted at Bellaghy Bawn on Thursday evening to commemorate the anniversary of Mr Brown's death The 25th anniversary of Sean Brown's death will be commemorated by his club Bellaghy Wolfe Tones with a number of events.

"PSNI apologises to family of murdered GAA officialThe police also pay an undisclosed sum to the family of Sean Brown, who was killed 25 years ago.Northern IrelandBig C podcaster Deborah James gets a damehoodThe podcast host, who is receiving end-of-life care for cancer, said she was ""blown away"" by the honour.UK","Sean Brown was abducted from the grounds of Bellaghy Wolfe Tones GAC in 1997 The PSNI has paid an undisclosed sum to the family of a GAA official murdered by loyalists in 1997 and apologised over inadequacies in the original investigation. Sean Brown, 61, was abducted in Bellaghy, County Londonderry and shot near Randalstown, County Antrim. He was locking the gates of GAA club Bellaghy Wolfe Tones when he was taken by the Loyalist Volunteer Force (LVF). No-one has ever been convicted of the murder. It is 25 years to the day since Mr Brown was killed. Sean Brown's body was found in a burnt-out car near Randalstown A statement agreed between Mr Brown's family and the PSNI was read out in court, in which the victim was described as a ""devoted family man and a pillar of the Bellaghy community"". It added that the PSNI ""continues to engage fully in the ongoing inquest proceedings"". The Brown family's solicitor Niall Murphy, speaking outside court after the PSNI settlement, said: ""This family should never have had to take litigation to extract a semblance of accountability and all it is is an apology."" He added that while it was welcome, it ""should never have been the case, there should have been an adequate, full, exhaustive investigation at the appropriate time"". The apology, along with an undisclosed financial settlement, brings the long-running legal action brought by Mr Brown's widow to an end. It had been her case that the police had protected the LVF killers and that this was reflected in a sub-standard investigation conducted by the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC). The RUC was the police force at the time of Mr Brown's murder. It was reformed and renamed as the PSNI in 2001. Speaking outside the court, Mr Brown's grandson Damon Brown said it was a day of ""mixed emotions"" and described the settlement as ""a step"", after a terrible 25 years of struggle. Sean Brown's family said the PSNI apology and financial settlement was a step toward getting the answers they need ""It's one step forward instead of ten steps back,"" he said. ""Hopefully the inquest will bring the answers we need."" The coroner's inquest has been consistently delayed due to several issues, including thedisclosure of documents. The Brown family have been campaigning for years, during which time there have been a number of reports criticising the RUC's investigation into the killing. In 2004, the then Police Ombudsman Nuala O'Loan said an investigation by the RUC into Mr Brown's murder was ""incomplete and inadequate"". It said the investigation had not been ""efficiently and property carried out"" and that ""no earnest effort was made to identify those who had carried out the murder"". Mr Brown's murder was then re-examined by the now defunct Historical Enquiries Team, which was also critical of the RUC investigation. Sean Brown's son Damian, who campaigned for justice for his father, died in October 2021 In 2015, it emerged during the inquest thatrelevant classified material was lost and redactions, including the blanking out of names, on 34 folders of non-sensitive material had not been completed by the PSNI. Despite delays the family's solicitor Niall Murphy said the inquest will take place and has been scheduled. He also paid tribute to Sean Brown's son, Damian Brown, who had attended every day of the inquest hearings. He died in October 2021 after a short illness. ""There was 34 preliminary hearings, often days of frustration, often days where he left insulted, but he came back every single day."" Mr Murphy said. ""Whilst today is welcome, it is bittersweet that Damian isn't here."" He added: ""Today is a validation of all of his perseverance to preserve the integrity of his father's memory."" A tree was planted at Bellaghy Bawn on Thursday evening to commemorate the anniversary of Mr Brown's death The 25th anniversary of Sean Brown's death will be commemorated by his club Bellaghy Wolfe Tones with a number of events. This included the planting of a tree and unveiling of a stone plaque, inscribed with the poem ""The Augean Stables"" written by the late Seamus Heaney after hearing about his death, at Bellaghy Bawn, on Thursday evening by the GAA's (Gaelic Athletic Association) president Larry McCarthy.

Two Twitter bosses ousted ahead of Musk takeover,"Twitter has confirmed that two of its bosses are leaving the social media company in one of the biggest shake-ups since Elon Musk agreed to buy the firm. The executives had been leading Twitter's consumer and revenue operations. From this week, the firm has also paused most hiring, except for ""business critical roles"". The move comes as the multi-billionaire Tesla boss moves ahead with a $44bn (Â£36bn) takeover of the platform. ""We are pulling back on non-labour costs to ensure we are being responsible and efficient,"" a Twitter spokesperson told the BBC. Kayvon Beykpour, who led Twitter's consumer division, and Bruce Falck, who oversaw revenue, both tweeted on Thursday that the departures were not their decisions. Mr Beykpour said that he is currently on paternity leave and was disappointed after being asked to leave by Mr Parag, who ""wants to take the team in a different direction"". Allow Twitter content?

Elon Musk would reverse Donald Trump's Twitter ban X marks the spot for Musk's Twitter growth plans Elon Musk lines up $7bn backing for Twitter deal This week, Mr Musk said he would reverse former US President Donald Trump's ban from Twitter if his takeover bid was successful. Appearing at an event on Tuesday he said: ""I would reverse the permanent ban but I don't own Twitter yet so this is not a thing that will definitely happen."" On Thursday, he tweeted: ""Even though I think a less divisive candidate would be better in 2024, I still think Trump should be restored to Twitter."" Mr Trump has said that he does not want to return to Twitter, but instead aims to build up his own Truth Social platform. He was banned from Twitter permanentlyin January 2021 because of the ""risk of further incitement of violence"" following the storming of the US Capitol, the company said then.

LiveLivePutin humiliating himself on the world stage - UK18 minutes ago,"Ukraine's defence minister says he hopes to arm a million fighters as the country prepares for a ""new, long phase of war"" The arrival of foreign weapons and ""stimulating Ukrainian producers"" will help further tip the balance against Russia, Oleksiy Reznikov says Russian troops made three unsuccessful attempts to build bridges across a river in eastern Ukraine, Luhansk's regional governor says Images from the scene show dozens of burnt-out tanks after Ukrainian forces shelled the temporary structures Ukrainian defenders destroyed around 70 units of heavy weaponry and equipment over three days, says Serhiy Haidai The first alleged war crime case since the conflict began has started in Ukraine's capital Kyiv Russian soldier Vadim Shishimarin, 21, faces possible life imprisonment on charges of war crimes and premeditated murder Edited by Chris Giles Please join ushere for updates and analysis over the weekend. We're closing our live coverage of the war in Ukraine for today in a little while. We'll leave you with a brief recap of what's happened: Fighting in the east  Beyond the Donbas region  In diplomacy  You can read about more of the day's key events here. Ukraine has said it is returning the bodies of fallen Russian troops back home. On Friday, military officials were seen loading and stacking bodies collected from the Kyiv and Chernihiv regions onto refrigerated rail cars. The move is in accordance with ""the norms of international humanitarian law"", according to Volodymyr Lyamzin, the head of Ukraine's civil-military cooperation. ""After the active phase of the conflict is over, sides have to return the bodies of the military of another country. Ukraine is ready to return the bodies to the aggressor,â Lyamzin told the Reuters news agency. Several refrigerated trains have reportedly been stationed in other parts of the country as well. Ukraine claims it has killed some 20,000 Russian troops. Russia has not updated its death toll since 25 March, when it acknowledged 1,351 deaths. TheBBC Ukrainian serviceis reporting that the Ukrainian army has released two decks of cards depicting Russians they suspect of war crimes. The idea replicates the set of55 playing cardsthat the US military produced in the 2003 invasion of Iraq, depicting what it said were the most wanted members of Saddam Hussein's government. Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Valerii Zaluzhnyi, said the cards were produced with the help of volunteers from the international intelligence community InformNapalm. US President Joe Biden has spoken with the leaders of Finland and Sweden about their plans to join the Nato alliance. The White House said Biden had held a joint phone call with Finnish President Sauli NiinistÃ¶ and Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson about the issue on Friday. A readout of the call claims the trio discussed Natoâs Open Door policy and ""the right of Finland and Sweden to decide their own future, foreign policy, and security arrangements"". Afterwards, NiinistÃ¶ wrote on Twitter that he ""went through Finland's next steps towards Nato membership"" on the call. It comes a day after NiinistÃ¶ and Finland's PM Sanna Marin called for the historically neutral country to apply for Nato membership ""without delay"". Sweden will announce its own decision on joining Nato on Sunday. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

As we reported on Thursday, a US lawmaker has single-handedly blocked a multi billion-dollar aid package to Ukraine from passing this week. President Joe Biden had called on Congress to send the bill - $39.8bn in economic, humanitarian and security assistance - to his desk by the end of the week, but Senator Rand Paul blocked an expedited vote on Thursday evening alleging that the government was ""shuffling money out the door as fast as they can"" with no oversight. ""My oath of office is to the US Constitution, not to any foreign nation,"" Paul said on the Senate floor defending his decision. ""We cannot save Ukraine by dooming the US economy."" The senator from Kentucky is calling for a watchdog provision in the bill to oversee how the money is being spent, an amendment that would require further delays in the bill's passage. Congressional leaders have chided the congressman for causing the delay, as the current bill has enough votes to pass in the Senate through regular order but this will now not happen until next week. Paul's defiance has been lauded in some corners, with former president Donald Trump's son arguing lawmakers in Washington - or ""the swamp"" as he called them - ""don't want transparency"".

Sweden and Finland have said that they will hold talks with the Turkish government after its president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, said he was not in favour of their plans to join Nato. The Swedish and Finnish foreign ministers, Ann Linde and Pekka Haavisto said they would speak to their Turkish counterpart, Mevlut Cavusoglu, about the issue at a Nato meeting on Saturday. Erdogan said that Nordic countries had given asylum to people Turkey considers to be Kurdish terrorists. He added that he did not want Nato to repeat what he called the mistake of the past when it allowed Greece to join. Responding to Turkey's comments, the US said Turkey ""is a valued Nato ally"" and ""they've been involved and helpful in trying to get a dialogue going here, between Russia and Ukraine"". John Kirby, press secretary for the US Ministry of Defence, added ""we're working to better clarify the [Turkey's] position here"". Law enforcement officers in Ukraine are investigating 41 Russian servicemen suspected of having committed war crimes in the country, Interfax-Ukraine news agency reports. Prosecutor-General Iryna Venediktova said the suspects will be investigated for a range of crimes - from the bombing of civilian infrastructure, killing of civilians, rape and looting. The suspects will answer before a Ukrainian court of law, she added. Today, a Russian soldier accused of killing an unarmed 62-year-old civilian appeared in court in Kyiv. Vadim Shishimarin, 21, was brought to court for a preliminary hearing. He faces possible life imprisonment on charges of war crimes and premeditated murder. During a televised address on Friday evening, Venediktova said preliminary hearings on two more suspects will be carried out next week. The leader of breakaway region South Ossetia has announced a referendum on whether to become a part of Russia. A statement from the office of Anatoly Bibilov said it was his people's ""historic aspiration"" to come together with Russia, and the vote would take place on 17 July. Moscow recognises the region as independent, after a brief war between Russia and Georgia in 2008, and has provided financial support, Russian citizenship for its citizens and sited military bases there. Georgia maintains that South Ossetia is an occupied territory and previously said that a referendum on joining Russia would be unacceptable. Negotiations with Russia over freeing the Ukrainian fighters under siege in the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol were ""very difficult"", Ukraine's deputy prime minister has said. In an online post, Iryna
Vereshchuk wrote: ""The result may not be to everyone's liking, but our task is
to evacuate our boys. All of them. ""Alive."" Yesterday, the Ukrainian government said that it was pushing for safe passage for 38 badly wounded fighters, in exchange for captured Russians. The Azovstal complex once sheltered hundreds of civilians and fighters, but after several weeks trapped underground civilians were freed in a series of humanitarian convoys last week and negotiations over the fighters began. The Russian air force has attacked an arms depot in the Kharkiv region in Ukraine, state news agency RIA reports. The news agency quoted the Russian defence ministry saying it had hit the facility on Friday. Meanwhile, eyewitnesses to an earlier attack in Kharkiv told news agency AFP that they had been targeted by a Russian tank as they tried to seek shelter at home. ""Four people died, two were injured. My daughter died from a shrapnel wound in the back of her head,"" Olga Karpenko, 52, said. The BBC has not been able to independently verify this information. Sergei Shoigu (pictured) spoke with his US counterpart for an hour More details have emerged of the telephone call between US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin and Russia's Defence Minister Sergei Shoygu, in which General Austin called for an immediate ceasefire. Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said that Gen Austin had stressed the importance of maintaining communication, after Moscow had appeared uninterested in speaking to the US on previous attempts to hold the conversation. An anonymous US official said the tone of the hour-long call was ""professional"", but did not resolve any specific issues or lead to changes in Russian policy, news agency Reuters report. Russia's defence ministry confirmed that the US had initiated the call, and discussed ""topical issues of international security... including the situation in Ukraine"". Olga IvshinaSenior correspondent, BBC News Russian Since the start of the war, our team has been following and verifying reports of losses among Russian troops fighting in Ukraine by following official announcements, local media reports as well as social media and speaking to the relatives of Russian servicemen. Up to this moment BBC News Russian has been able to verify the deaths of 2,336 Russian servicemen. We have been able to establish their names, ranks and military units where they served. This is nearly twice the latest official figure released by the Russian Defence Ministry in March. It is likely that the real figure of the Russian military in Ukraine is far higher than we have been able to establish. But our data analysis helps to see the trends of what is happening with the Russian army fighting in Ukraine. Nearly 20% of all confirmed military casualties are officers. This proportion has remained unchanged for the past three months. Experts say that Russian officers may have to risk more on the frontline because of persistent problems with communications. Over 25% of all losses are paratroopers and marines. These units are often used in reconnaissance and storming operations. However they often donât get enough operational support and evacuation opportunities for the wounded. Most of the casualties, confirmed by us, came from the least developed and economically deprived regions of Russia. There are only three confirmed deaths of servicemen from Moscow, even though the capital makes up almost 9% of the Russian population. Ukrainian authorities now say that nearly 27,000 Russian soldiers have been killed. Read the full story on the BBC's Russian service here. As we've been reporting, Ukraine's Defence Minister Oleksiy Reznikov has said the country is entering a new stage of the war. Reznikov pledged to arm a million fighters using the new weapons and military equipment the US and other Western countries have been donating to the country over the last couple of weeks. The defence minister said that during the beginning of the war, ""volunteers were extremely helpful"" and it's thanks to their mobility that they ""quickly resolved highly pressing issues"". Reznikov said that to win, Ukraine ""must plan resources carefully and avoid mistakes"" and was investing in Ukrainian production facilities to ""ensure the stability and frequency of deliveries"". In his statement on Facebook, he said that Ukraine had relied on charitable aid from citizens, volunteers, and civic organisations for a significant proportion of its military equipment. He said that at the end of April, Ukraine's ministry of defence was relying on donations for 50% of the bullet proof vests used in combat. But as of 13 May, Ukraine has managed to increase its production to provide 57% of the armed forces' bullet proof vests, he added. More now on the suspension of electricity exports from Russia to Finland, which followed rising tensions over Helsinki's announcement of its plan to join Nato. RAO Nordic, a subsidiary of the Russian company Inter RAO, said non-payment was behind its decision to halt electrity supplies. The company said they had not received funds since 6 May and described the situation as ""exceptional"", adding that it is the first time it's happened ""in over 20 years of our trading history"". It did not specify whether this was due to the impact of sanctions but added, ""we hope that the situation will get improved soon and the electricity trade with Russia could resume"". Meanwhlle, the Finnish grid operator Fingrid said it did not anticpate any problems with supply as a result of the suspension. It said it would make up the shortfall by generating more power domestically and increasing imports from Sweden. This video can not be played Scenes of devastation as 'Russian battalion destroyed' If you're just joining us, here's a little recap of the latest events in Ukraine to bring you up to speed. Russian bridge-building foiled  Beyond the Donbas region  In diplomacy Ukraine's defence minister has said he hopes to arm a million fighters as the country prepares for a ""new, long phase of war"". Oleksiy Reznikov noted in a Facebook post that Ukraine would ""need to meticulously plan resources"" and ""avoid mistakes"" in order to win the war. Already, he said, Russia had suffered a ""strategic defeat"". The arrival of foreign weapons and ""stimulating Ukrainian producers"" would help further tip the balance against Russia, he continued. But before that, Ukraine was ""facing extremely difficult weeks ahead"". ""Nobody can tell how many. In that period, we will hold the defence primarily with our own resources against the enemy mad with rage,"" he predicted, in comments translated by our colleagues at BBC Monitoring. ""Increasing pressure of sanctions against Russia and increasing foreign assistance to Ukraine should create, within several months, the conditions under which the Kremlin will finally lose all chances to achieve any success. Then a new window of opportunity will appear for Ukraine. In this extremely hard period, we need unity, cohesion, will and patience,"" he concluded. Electricity exports from Russia to Finland are being suspended from 01:00 local time (22:00 GMT) on Saturday. Finnish grid operator Fingrid said Russian utility Inter RAO was stopping supplies due to ""problems in receiving payments for electricity sold on the market"". The announcement comes the day after Finland signalled its intention to join Nato. Finland only buys 10% of its electricity from Russia, and according to Fingrid it will make up the shortfall by sourcing more power from Sweden, and increasing generation in Finland. Finland expects to become self-sufficient in electrical energy in 2023, the company added. Sophie WilliamsBBC News, Lviv Ukraine says it's thwarted Russian attempts to create a key bridging point A Ukrainian military analyst admits that constant attacks
from Moscow mean the Ukrainians are on the back foot around the Siversky Donets
river â even though theyâve managed to thwart Russian attempts to put down
bridges near Severodonetsk. âThe advantage is now on the side of the Russian Federation,â
Oleh Zhdanov tells the BBC. âWe still can't bring down Russia's offensive pace.â Zhdanov says itâs âvery importantâ that his
side keeps control of this part of the Siversky Donets. Gaining the area would allow the Russians to make a
bridgehead and advance in the direction of the riverâs estuary, Zhdanov explains.
This would let them encircle the key city of Severodonetsk more fully as they
attempt to cut off Ukraineâs whole eastern Donbas region. The order for soldiers to gain this territory came
from the very top, Zhdanov adds. âThey are advancing so hard because it is a
political task, because Putin has ordered it,â he says. As weâve been reporting today, UK
defence intelligence says a Russian battalion lost almost all its armoured
vehicles during failed attempts to establish bridges across the river. Russia
has not commented. Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoygu and his US counterpart Lloyd Austin have spoken for the first time since 18 February - before Russia invaded Ukraine. According to a statement issued by the Pentagon, Austin urged an immediate ceasefire in Ukraine and used the call to emphasise the importance of maintaining lines of communication. On Wednesday, Austin held talks with UK Defence Minister Ben Wallace. In a statement, Wallace said the two leaders pledged ""to continue to work with unity and resolve to provide
Ukraine with what it needs to defend itself against Russiaâs
unprovoked invasion"". Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Keep sanctions until Russia leaves Ukraine - TrussThe foreign secretary urges allies to only lift sanctions after Moscow withdraws its troops.,"Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said Russian forces must completely withdraw before sanctions are lifted International sanctions against Russia should only be lifted when all of its troops have left Ukraine, the foreign secretary has said. Liz Truss also told a meeting of G7 foreign ministers on Thursday that allies should go ""further and faster"" in supporting Ukraine's resistance. She said Russian President Vladimir Putin must face a defeat that prevents further aggression. Some analysts have warned this stance may make a political settlement harder. The Foreign Office said Ms Truss urged her counterparts at the meeting in Germany to commit to further waves of sanctions for as long as Russian troops remain in Ukraine. She told them: ""Putin is humiliating himself on the world stage. We must ensure he faces a defeat in Ukraine that denies him any benefit and ultimately constrains further aggression."" What is Nato and how do you join? Hard to see a way back for Putin, says PM Push Russia out of whole of Ukraine, says Truss The foreign secretary has been among the most outspoken of UK ministers in setting out explicit war aims, saying in a speech last month that Russia should be pushed out of ""the whole of Ukraine"". But some foreign policy analysts fear that such specific demands might one day clash with Ukraine's interests and could make negotiations harder. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has alsowarned against the ""renormalisation"" of relations with Russia, saying it would risk repeating the world's errors over Moscow's annexation of Crimea in 2014 - the precursor to its full invasion of Ukraine earlier this year. In the meeting with other foreign ministers from wealthy nations, Ms Truss also repeated calls to increase support for the defence of Ukraine, including increased access to military equipment used by the Nato military alliance. She said: ""The best long-term security for Ukraine will come from it being able to defend itself. That means providing Ukraine with a clear pathway to Nato-standard equipment."" Ukrainian and Moldovan foreign ministers are expected to join the G7 ministers at another meeting in Germany on Friday. Then on Saturday, Ms Truss is due to travel to Berlin for a meeting of Nato foreign ministers, where the Foreign Office said she will push for a ""strengthened and modernised"" version of the Western alliance. It comes after Finland's leaders announced they supported the country joining Nato. Less than 24 hours earlier, Finland and its neighbour Sweden also signed a defence pact with the UK, which could see British troops sent to the Nordic nations in the event of a Russian invasion. Both countries had previously chosen to stay neutral to avoid antagonising Russia, which shares a 830-mile border with Finland.

Couple sue son for not giving them a grandchild,"Indian wedding can often be lavish affairs, with thousands of guests A couple in the north Indian state of Uttarakhand are suing their only son and his wife for not giving them a grandchild after six years of marriage. Sanjeev and Sadhana Prasad, 61 and 57, say they used up their savings raising their son, paying for his pilot's training as well as a lavish wedding. They are demanding compensation worth nearly $650,000 (Â£525,000) if no grandchild is born within a year. Their son and his wife do not appear to have commented. The highly unusual lawsuit was filed on grounds of ""mental harassment"". Mr Prasad said he had spent all his savings on his son, sending him to the US in 2006 for pilot training at a cost of $65,000. He returned to India in 2007, but lost his job and his family had to support him financially for more than two years,the Times of India reports,external. Shrey Sagar, 35, did eventually get a job as a pilot.

Keep sanctions until Russia leaves Ukraine - Truss,"Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said Russian forces must completely withdraw before sanctions are lifted International sanctions against Russia should only be lifted when all of its troops have left Ukraine, the foreign secretary has said. Liz Truss also told a meeting of G7 foreign ministers on Thursday that allies should go ""further and faster"" in supporting Ukraine's resistance. She said Russian President Vladimir Putin must face a defeat that prevents further aggression. Some analysts have warned this stance may make a political settlement harder. The Foreign Office said Ms Truss urged her counterparts at the meeting in Germany to commit to further waves of sanctions for as long as Russian troops remain in Ukraine. She told them: ""Putin is humiliating himself on the world stage. We must ensure he faces a defeat in Ukraine that denies him any benefit and ultimately constrains further aggression."" What is Nato and how do you join? Hard to see a way back for Putin, says PM Push Russia out of whole of Ukraine, says Truss The foreign secretary has been among the most outspoken of UK ministers in setting out explicit war aims, saying in a speech last month that Russia should be pushed out of ""the whole of Ukraine"". But some foreign policy analysts fear that such specific demands might one day clash with Ukraine's interests and could make negotiations harder. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has alsowarned against the ""renormalisation"" of relations with Russia, saying it would risk repeating the world's errors over Moscow's annexation of Crimea in 2014 - the precursor to its full invasion of Ukraine earlier this year. In the meeting with other foreign ministers from wealthy nations, Ms Truss also repeated calls to increase support for the defence of Ukraine, including increased access to military equipment used by the Nato military alliance. She said: ""The best long-term security for Ukraine will come from it being able to defend itself. That means providing Ukraine with a clear pathway to Nato-standard equipment."" Ukrainian and Moldovan foreign ministers are expected to join the G7 ministers at another meeting in Germany on Friday. Then on Saturday, Ms Truss is due to travel to Berlin for a meeting of Nato foreign ministers, where the Foreign Office said she will push for a ""strengthened and modernised"" version of the Western alliance. It comes after Finland's leaders announced they supported the country joining Nato. Less than 24 hours earlier, Finland and its neighbour Sweden also signed a defence pact with the UK, which could see British troops sent to the Nordic nations in the event of a Russian invasion. Both countries had previously chosen to stay neutral to avoid antagonising Russia, which shares a 830-mile border with Finland.

Tenants search for homes with bills included,"Demand among tenants has jumped for properties where all the bills are included in the rent, according to Rightmove. The property website said inquiries for build-to-rent homes with bills included had risen by 36% over the past year. Millions of people are facing rising domestic gas and electricity bills as the cost of living soars. The prospect of further rises will have increased demand for all-in rent. Existing pressure on tenants' finances comes as the average monthly rent being advertised across Britain (excluding London) was a record Â£1,088 in the first three months of the year. That was an 11% annual increase, Rightmove said. In London, average asking rents have increased by 14% annually to Â£2,195 per calendar month. Energy bills set to rise again in October Mum asked landlord to evict her as rent rises Return to the office boosts demand for city flats There are also more than triple the number of tenants inquiring as there are rental properties available, making the market highly competitive, according to the website. Homes with balconies, communal gardens, properties allowing pets and those offering zero deposits were all popular, it said. Nearly two-thirds (63%) of landlords told Rightmove they have kept rents the same for their tenants over the past year, with the remaining 37% saying they have increased their rents. Tim Bannister, Rightmove's director of property data, said: ""A shortage of rental homes and strong demand for the properties available has led to a greater number of tenants choosing to renew their leases and stay put, rather than re-enter a competitive rental market. ""People who had been waiting to see what happened last year are now being faced with record rents and so are seeking out properties where they can have more certainty over their outgoings, with all bills included becoming increasingly sought after. ""Landlords may have been tempted to put their rents up given the high demand from new tenants, but many understand the affordability challenges of rising rents and bills, as our study shows that the majority are charging their tenants the same as a year ago."" The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) said earlier in the week that 63% of property professionals expected rents to rise in the next three months, the highest proportion since its records started in 1999.

Energy bills set to rise in October,"Householders should expect a further rise in energy bills in England, Wales and Scotland in October, the boss of energy regulator Ofgem has said. Jonathan Brearley said prices in the wholesale energy market remained ""highly volatile"". Not being able to afford energy bills was a matter of life and death for some people, he said. Analysts Cornwall Insight predicted that a typical domestic energy bill will go up by Â£600 a year in October. That would take the typical household's gas and and electricity bill to Â£2,595. In a speech in Glasgow,external, Mr Brearley said that gas markets were in a febrile state following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. ""The market remains highly volatile and as a result we do expect further price increases later this year,"" he said. He said that the effect of higher prices was ""putting huge strain on the customers we serve"". ""I talk to customers on a regular basis, and I know how tough rising energy prices are for many households and businesses,"" he said. ""For some, not being able to afford rising energy bills is literally a matter of life and death."" He pointed to a case in which a woman who was being treated for a brain tumour had worries about keeping up with energy bills. ""What was shocking was to learn that she feels more comfortable in hospital where she can eat and be warm than at home,"" he said. A widely-predicted increase in October comes on top of a Â£700 typical rise in annual domestic gas and electricity bills, which took effect in April when the price cap was last raised. Consumers in Northern Ireland - not covered by the price cap - have already seen significant increases in bills. Businesses have also faced higher energy costs, which may lead to them charging higher prices. Mr Brearley reiterated a commitment to updating the price cap, putting suppliers under greater scrutiny and helping move the UK away from a reliance on gas. How high could my energy bills go? New energy firms took high risk strategy - report Earlier on Monday, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research suggestedan estimated 1.5 million households across the UKwill struggle to pay food and energy bills over the next year. A Treasury spokesperson said the country has had a ""strong economic recovery"" from the pandemic but acknowledged that these were ""anxious times"", and said the government was taking action to support households. That includes Â£200 being taken off energy bills from October, but households will pay that back in instalments from 2023. Previous versions of this story quoted a speech by Mr Brearley in March.
