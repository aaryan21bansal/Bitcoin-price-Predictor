Israel strikes Hamas after rocket fire,"This video can not be played 'I didn't fall, they shot me' Israel says it has targeted sites in Gaza belonging to militant group Hamas in retaliation for rocket strikes. Israel's military said it had hit weapons sites early on Saturday. Two people died, a Gaza hospital said, bringing the deaths in Israeli strikes and gunfire over the past day to four. Three rockets were fired at Israel from Gaza late on Friday. Israeli-Palestinian tensions have risen since President Donald Trump recognised Jerusalem as Israel's capital. Wednesday's decision reversed decades of US neutrality on one of the most sensitive issues between the two sides. Israel has always regarded Jerusalem as its capital, while the Palestinians claim East Jerusalem - occupied by Israel in the 1967 war - as the capital of a future Palestinian state. The diplomatic fallout over Mr Trump's move has continued, with Palestinian officials saying that President Mahmoud Abbas will refuse to meet US Vice-President Mike Pence later this month. Egypt's Coptic Church has also cancelled a planned meeting, saying Mr Trump's declaration ""did not take into account the feelings of millions of Arab people"". At a security conference in Bahrain, the UAE's Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash said the Jerusalem announcement was ""a gift to radicalism"", Reuters news agency reports. Frank Gardner: Counter-terror efforts at risk? This video can not be played On Friday, crowds gathered in Jerusalem's Old City to protest against Mr Trump's decision There have been fresh protests in the West Bank city of Bethlehem and in East Jerusalem. In other developments: Israel's air force followed a number of raids on Hamas sites on Friday with more air strikes in the early hours of Saturday, targeting weapons manufacturing sites, a weapons warehouse and a military compound, the Israel Defense Forces said Gaza's Shifa hospital says that two bodies of Palestinians were found under the rubble of a Hamas military site bombed by Israeli planes overnight, bringing the death toll in the past 24 hours to four. Two Palestinians were also killed in clashes with Israeli troops at the Gaza border At least 217 Palestinians were also wounded, Palestinian medics say Of the three rockets fired at Israel, Israel's military said it had intercepted one with its Iron Dome defence system, one was found on wasteland and another landed in Sderot late on Friday. No casualties were reported Earlier on Friday, Fathi Hammad, a senior Hamas leader, said anyone seeking to move their embassy to Jerusalem was ""an enemy of the Palestinians"". Speaking before the United Nations on Friday, US ambassador Nikki Haley said the US ""recognises the obvious; that Jerusalem is the capital of Israel"". She said the US continued to be ""committed to achieving a lasting peace agreement"", and accused the UN of bias, saying it ""has outrageously been one of the world's foremost centres of hostility towards Israel"". This video can not be played US ambassador Nikki Haley calls UN hostile to Israel ""Israel will never be, and never should be, bullied into an agreement by the United Nations or by any collection of countries that have proven their disregard for Israel's security,"" Mrs Haley said. Israel had deployed extra battalions to the West Bank in anticipation of violence after Palestinian leaders called for protests after Friday prayers. What are the alternatives to a two-state solution? Why settlement issue is so difficult There were protests held elsewhere on Friday against Mr Trump's announcement. Thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters held demonstrations in Jordan, Egypt, Iraq, Turkey, Tunisia and Iran. Further afield, protesters rallied in Malaysia, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Indian-administered Kashmir and Indonesia, the world's largest Muslim-majority country. This video can not be played Why the ancient city of Jerusalem is so important Jerusalem is of huge importance to both Israel and the Palestinians. It contains sites sacred to the three major monotheistic faiths - Judaism, Islam and Christianity. Israel occupied the eastern sector - previously occupied by Jordan - in 1967, and annexed it in 1980, but the move has never been recognised internationally. Some 330,000 Palestinians live in East Jerusalem, along with about 200,000 Israeli Jews in a dozen settlements there. The settlements are considered illegal under international law, though Israel does not regard them as settlements but legitimate neighbourhoods. According to the 1993 Israel-Palestinian peace accords, the final status of Jerusalem is meant to be discussed in the latter stages of peace talks. The last round of talks between Israel and the Palestinians broke down in 2014 and while the US is formulating fresh proposals, Palestinian officials say Mr Trump's announcement has disqualified the US from brokering future negotiations.

UN wraps up rare North Korea trip,"Mr Feltman met top North Korean officials on his trip including Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho A top UN official told senior North Korean figures there was an ""urgent need"" to keep channels open to avoid the risk of war, the organisation says. The statement follows a visit to Pyongyang by Jeffrey Feltman, the highest-level trip by a UN official to the isolated nation in six years. North Korea says it has agreed to regular communication with the UN. Tensions over the North's weapons programme were raised further after a fresh ballistic missile test last week. North Korea said it was its most advanced missile yet, capable of reaching the continental US. The test was the latest in a series of nuclear and missile tests conducted in defiance of UN sanctions. South Korea and the US have meanwhile been carrying out large-scale military drills in a show of force. North Korea: What could tip the balance? What we know about new NK missile On Sunday, South Korea said it will join the US in imposing fresh sanctions against the North. Twenty North Korean firms and 12 individuals have reportedly been added to a South Korean blacklist, which will take effect from Monday. The move by Seoul, its second set of unilateral sanctions in a month, was designed to cut off international sources of funding for North Korea's nuclear missile programme, a foreign ministry official in Seoul said. The measures are in addition to those imposed by the UN Security Council. The UN continues to operate in North Korea, with programmes providing food, agricultural and health aid butthe last visit by a senior official was back in 2011. After the UN's Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs Mr Feltman met senior North Koreans all agreed ""the current situation was the most tense and dangerous peace and security issue in the world today"",according to the statement,external. ""Noting the urgent need to prevent miscalculations and open channels to reduce the risks of conflict, Mr Feltman underlined that the international community, alarmed by escalating tensions, is committed to the achievement of a peaceful solution,"" it added. What Hwasong-15 launch pictures tell us Triumph, threats follow N Korea missile North Korean state media earlier said current tensions were ""entirely ascribable to the US hostile policy"". Some of latest pictures released by North Korea showed Kim Jong-un on Mount Paektu, the country's highest peak But in its reporting of Mr Feltman's trip, KCNA also said both sides agreed on ""communication through visits at different level on a regular basis in the future"". Before leaving for Pyongyang, Mr Feltman held talks in China, North Korea's historic ally and main trading partner. Despite calls from other world leaders for restraint, this year has seen US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un hurl insults at each other, both at one time saying the other was mad. US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson though hassaid that lines of communication are open between the two sides. North Korea argues nuclear capabilities are its only deterrent against an outside world seeking to destroy it. How North Korea could tip the balance What do we know about N Korea's new missile?

Hoffman faces new sex abuse allegation,"Hoffman has not commented on the latest allegations A co-star of Hollywood actor Dustin Hoffman has accused him of a ""horrific, demoralising and abusive experience"" while on a 1984 Broadway production. Kathryn Rossetter's allegation comes a month after author Anna Graham Hunter accused Hoffman of sexual misconduct. Hoffman has not commented on the latest claims,externalin the Hollywood Reporter. It said it had spoken to several people on the 1984 set who questioned Rossetter's account and said they had not witnessed the conduct described. The latest allegation is one of a string made against Hollywood stars and executives, sparked by initial allegations against producer Harvey Weinstein. Rossetter's account was carried in a guest column in the Hollywood Reporter on Friday, asAnna Graham Hunter's allegations,externalhad been in an article on 1 November. Rossetter said the alleged events had occurred on the 1984 Broadway production of Death Of A Salesman. She said Hoffman would regularly grope her. The actor would grab her breast and then remove his hand just before a photograph was taken, she alleged. Harassment in Hollywood: who's been accused? On one night, she said, Hoffman exposed her body to the stage crew. ""Suddenly he grabs the bottom of my slip and pulls it up over my head, exposing my breasts and body to the crew and covering my face,"" she said. Rossetter added: ""Night after night I went home and cried. I withdrew and got depressed and did not have any good interpersonal relationships with the cast."" She said: ""I considered reporting him to Actors Equity. But I was cautioned by some respected theatre professionals that if I did, I would probably lose my job and, because he was such a powerful star, any hope of a career."" The Reporter said Hoffman's lawyers had put it in touch with others who had worked on the set, including Hoffman's brother-in-law, Lee Gottsegen, and actors Anne McIntosh, Debra Mooney, Linda Hogan, Michael Quinlan and Andrew Bloch. The paper said they had not witnessed the alleged misconduct and had questioned Rossetter's account. Production stage manager Tom Kelly said: ""It just doesn't ring true."" Earlier in the week, TV host John Oliver confronted Dustin Hoffman, 80, in a tense public discussion about the allegations of sexual harassment made by Graham Hunter. At a Q&A panel for the 20th anniversary of Hoffman's film Wag The Dog, the actor defended himself, asking Oliver: ""Do you believe this stuff that you're reading?"" and saying he still did not know who Graham Hunter was. She worked as a 17-year-old intern on Hoffman's 1985 TV movie version of Death Of A Salesman. Hoffman had earlier put out a statement following Graham Hunter's allegations, saying: ""I have the utmost respect for women and feel terrible that anything I might have done could have put her in an uncomfortable situation. ""I am sorry. It is not reflective of who I am."" More stars face harassment accusations Harassment in Hollywood: Who's been accused?

Egypt uncovers ancient tombs at Luxor,"The mummy is believed to be that of a senior official from the New Kingdom Archaeologists in Egypt have displayed items, including a mummy, from one of two previously unexplored tombs in the ancient Nile city of Luxor. The mummy is believed to be that of a senior official from Egypt's ""New Kingdom"", about 3,500 years ago. Other items included figurines, wooden masks and richly coloured wall paintings. The tombs lie in the Draa Abul Naga necropolis, an area famed for its temples and burial grounds. It is close to the Valley of the Kings where many of ancient Egypt's pharaohs were buried. Egypt's antiquities ministry said that the tombs had been discovered by a German archaeologist in the 1990s, but were kept sealed until recently. Antiquities expert Mustafa al-Waziri showed reporters the intricate wall murals inside the tomb Painted wooden masks were found inside the excavated tomb The identity of the mummified body is not known but the ministry says there are two possibilities. It could be a person named Djehuty Mes, whose name is engraved on one of the walls, or it could be  a scribe called Maati whose name - and the name of his wife, Mehi - are written on funerary cones, officials said. The other tomb was only recently ""uncovered"" and has not yet been fully excavated, the ministry said. In September, archaeologists discovered the tomb of a royal goldsmith near Luxor. The tomb, which also dated back to the New Kingdom, contained a statue of the goldsmith Amenemhat, sitting beside his wife.

Two die after 'taking drugs at club',"Two 19-year-old men have died in hospital in the early hours after apparently taking drugs at a nightclub. They were found unconscious at the Pryzm club in Plymouth, where hundreds of young people were attending a gig by the Swedish dance artist Basshunter. Police said the teenagers, from Okehampton and Newton Abbot, were thought to have taken MDMA. The club was evacuated and an 18-year-old man was arrested by Devon and Cornwall Police. At about 02:00 GMT the poorly men were taken to Plymouth's Derriford Hospital, where they were later pronounced dead.  The two men were believed to have taken the recreational drug MDMA Det Insp Julie Scoles said the two who died were part of a larger group who took the drug. ""We have located the rest of the group who are thankfully showing no ill-effects at this time,"" she said. ""I am urging the public, especially those going out and planning to take recreational drugs, to be aware of this incident and think twice before taking any unknown substance - there is always a risk when taking drugs and the only way of staying safe is to avoid drugs altogether."" Next-of-kin have been informed, but formal identification of the victims has yet to take place and police have asked anyone with any information to contact them. The nightclub said the deaths were ""tragic and very sad"", and staff were co-operating with the police investigation.

Eurovision winner has heart transplant,"Salvador Sobral missed a week of Eurovision rehearsals due to his heart condition Portugal's celebrated Eurovision Song Contest winner, Salvador Sobral, is recovering in hospital after undergoing a heart transplant. Surgeons at the Santa Cruz Hospital in the Portuguese capital, Lisbon, said the 27-year-old was ""doing well"". Sobral, who suffered from a longstanding heart condition,won this year's contest with the love song Amar Pelos Dois(Love for Both of Us). It was the first time Portugal had taken the title. ""The surgery went well,"" said surgeon Miguel Abecasis,quoted by the Publico daily (in Portuguese),external. ""He was very well prepared. He is a young man who understood the difficulties of this type of procedure."" Mr Abecasis said that before Friday's operation the singer had wished him ""good luck"". The recovery would take a long time, Mr Abecasis added, but said that if all went well, Sobral would have ""a completely normal life"". The singer had to wait several months until a suitable donor was found, Publico reported. He announced in September that he was taking a break from performing. Sobral's winning ballad, written by his older sister, Luisa, made him a national hero in Portugal.

Johnson under pressure over jailed mum case,"Boris Johnson's visit to Iran will be his first as foreign secretary When Boris Johnson arrives in Tehran this weekend, the foreign secretary will be required to perform some nifty diplomatic footwork even before he comes to address the case of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe. For relations between Britain and the Islamic Republic of Iran are delicate at the best of times. It is only six years since a mob stormed and sacked Britain's embassy in Tehran. And to some in Iran, Britain will always be seen as the ""Little Satan"", a former imperial power that meddles in their country's affairs at America's bidding. Both the UK and Iran have now restored diplomatic relations. But good relations are a work in progress. So this visit, Mr Johnson's first, is designed above all to stabilise what has at times been a difficult relationship, a trip that was planned long before the case of Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe became a frontline political issue. And when Mr Johnson sits down for a lengthy session with his counterpart, Mohammed Javad Zarif, on Saturday, there will be much else to discuss. They will talk about the Iran nuclear deal. Tehran believes it has not reaped the economic benefits it expected from the agreement it struck to curb its nuclear ambitions. Britain wants to encourage Iran to stick with the agreement despite Donald Trump's decision not to certify the deal. Johnson to urge Iran to free prisoner Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe: Prisoner caught in Iran power struggle Iran nuclear deal: Key details They will talk about Yemen where Iran is backing the rebel Houthi forces. The foreign secretary will want to urge Tehran not to supply missiles that the Houthis have targeted at Saudi Arabia's airport. Tehran will want to see what kind of political process, if at all, is being contemplated by the Saudi-led coalition. They will also want to talk about Iran's behaviour in the Middle East that Britain sees as destabilising. Tehran will want to discuss how the West is planning to help rebuild Syria now that so-called Islamic State has been largely routed out. So it is within the context of these debates that both sides will discuss the fate of Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, the British Iranian mother who was arrested in 2016 and jailed for five years for vague charges of plotting against the Iranian state - charges she categorically denies. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe was arrested in Iran in 2016 The difficulty that Mr Johnson has is one of expectations. Ever since the foreign secretary mistakenly told MPs that Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was training journalists in Iran when in fact her family have always insisted she was on holiday, Mr Johnson has been under pressure to compensate for his error. His erroneous remarks were used by the Iranian regime to justify fresh charges against Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe. So Mr Johnson is now under huge pressure from campaigners and her husband Richard Ratcliffe to bring her home. Yet Mr Johnson will not be travelling with Mr Ratcliffe, as some had hoped might be possible. The Foreign Office says it wants to secure a permanent family reunion, not a temporary one. And Mr Johnson is also not expected to visit Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe in prison, something else that was asked of him. If the British ambassador has been refused access, why might the Iranians grant it to a visiting foreign secretary? The problem is that there might actually be only so much that Mr Johnson can do. He can talk to Mr Zarif until he is blue in the face. But there are others within Iran - such as the Revolutionary Guard Corps and the ultra-conservative judiciary - who perhaps will have a greater say over her fate. The Iranians know how much the British want to get Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe home. Being told that again directly by Mr Johnson may not change matters significantly. Some in the UK want Mr Johnson to pay off a long standing debt owed to the Iranians in an attempt to curry favour with Tehran. The UK owes Iran about Â£400m for some Chieftain tanks it promised the former Shah of Iran but never delivered after the 1979 revolution. The problem is that this debt has nothing to do with the Zaghari-Ratcliffe case. The UK has agreed to pay the money but can't until a legal way is found to get round the sanctions that currently make repayment impossible. There is also the strategic reluctance to allow any linkage between the two issues. Iran could pocket the money and quite legitimately refuse to release Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe because this is a debt, not a quid pro quo. The UK is also arguing strongly that she should be released on humanitarian grounds and is reluctant for her to be caught up in some grand bargain with Tehran. Richard Ratcliffe has been campaigning for his wife's release Britain does have some cards in its favour. It has come out strongly in favour of keeping the Iran nuclear deal, backing Tehran over Washington. The UK has also spoken out strongly against President Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. The problem is that this is, above all, a consular case. That means Britain can make an argument but ultimately it is Iran that will decide. Tehran does not recognise the concept of dual nationality so in its eyes Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe is Iranian. And her future is thus seen as a matter for the sovereign state of Iran. In truth, though, this is not just any other consular case. Mr Ratcliffe believes his wife is a pawn in a much larger diplomatic game, a bargaining chip whose life is being cruelly manipulated by some parts of the Iranian government to secure their political objectives. There are occasional moments of hope. In recent weeks a spokesman for Iran's judiciary has said that Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe could be freed if she qualified for conditional release. An Iranian health commissioner has conducted an assessment of her mental and physical well-being after she suffered from insomnia, depression and panic attacks. Mr Ratcliffe says that Mr Johnson being in Iran ""can only make things better"". But right now all his wife can look forward to is her next court appearance, which is scheduled for Sunday.

Newcastle 2-3 Leicester John HartsonFormer Arsenal striker at St James' Park for 5 live Sport Everyone knew it was going to be a long, hard season for Newcastle. They've played really well today but they've been outdone by a team with a lot quality. It was a magnificent game between two teams who showed a lot of endeavor, they were going end to end and it was a great advert for the Premier League. They've shown plenty of character so far this season Newcastle, but whether that's going to be enough to keep them in the Premier League I don't know. Newcastle 2-3 Leicester Solid work from Leicester, though, after that early Joselu goal for the hosts. A couple of great goals from Mahrez and Gray, before Perez's unfortunate own goal sealed it. The Foxes are up to eighth after their third consecutive victory. Claude Puel's revolution marches on. Newcastle 2-3 Leicester No time for Newcastle to salvage anything as Leicester ruin their 125th anniversary celebrations. That's the first time Rafael Benitez has lost three straight home games in the Premier League.

Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe: Caught in Iran power struggle,"Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe is serving a five-year sentence in Iran The case of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe is first and foremost a story of terrible personal suffering for a young woman, her husband and their baby girl. Eighteen months into a five-year sentence, Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe faces the prospect of up to 16 years in an Iranian jail. It is also, however, a story of an internal power struggle in Iran, as well as of the nation's deeply difficult relationship with the UK. To understand how she fits into this, the first thing to examine is the timing of her arrest. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was detained in April 2016, a few months ahead of the first anniversary of Iran's historic nuclear deal. This video can not be played Mr Ratcliffe maintains his wife is innocent The accord, on which President Hassan Rouhani had staked his reputation, was bitterly opposed by elements of the powerful Revolutionary Guards. They had often benefited financially from the sanctions regime. They were adamant that the nuclear deal must be seen as a failure, that it had changed nothing and that compromise with the West was a fruitless exercise. Arrests of a number of Iranians with dual nationality came about in this context: Siamak Namzi, an Iranian-American businessman, was detained in October 2015 Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a charity worker, was held the following April Homa Hoodfar, a Iranian-Canadian academic, was detained in June last year. Iran is in the grip of an ideological power-struggle, with two competing world views. President Rouhani came to power promising to open Iran up to the world; the supreme leader, the Revolutionary Guards and the judiciary have a far more hardline position, both in relation to how the country should be run as well as its foreign relations. Profile: Hassan Rouhani presents a vision for a moderate, modern and outward-looking Iran All the arrests were seen as an attempt by the Revolutionary Guards to undermine not just the president, but the very process of thawing relations with the West. Of the three dual-national prisoners arrested after the deal was agreed, only one has since been released: Ms Hoodfar was sent home a few months later on what the Iranians called ""humanitarian grounds"". The only significant difference between her case and Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's was their nationalities: one was half-Canadian, the other half-British. To Iranian minds, the UK is viewed with almost unique suspicion. Indeed, in 2009 the supreme leader said that of all the world's ""arrogant powers"", the UK was the ""most evil"". To understand why, one must go back to the 1953 coup-d'Ã©tat that overthrew nationalist Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh, returning the autocratic Shah to power. Behind it were the British and American intelligence agencies. Almost 300 people were killed in the streets of Tehran after protesting against the prime minister's removal in a US- and British-organised coup in 1953 This led to deep-rooted suspicions of the West's intentions; once the Shah was ousted by the Islamic Revolution of 1979, those suspicions became open hostilities. Relations have never really recovered. Over the years there have been a number of key points, notably the 1989 fatwah calling for the death of British author Salman Rushdie. His book, The Satanic Verses, was denounced as blasphemous by the supreme leader; he called on Muslims around the world to try and kill Rushdie. The controversy led to a severing of diplomatic ties, which were not repaired until 1998. In 2007, 15 British Royal Navy personnel were detained off the South Coast of Iran. They were paraded on TV, a show of power by Tehran, but ultimately released under diplomatic pressure. The 2009 re-election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was followed by peaceful street protests, which the supreme leader accused the West of encouraging.  A number of staff at the British embassy were arrested and forced to sign confessions. In November 2011, relations deteriorated further. After the UK increased sanctions on Iran, the parliament voted to expel the British ambassador. Before he could pack his bags, members of the hardline Basij militia ransacked the British embassy in Tehran. It did not re-open until 2014. But, it is not just the British government that has been viewed with great hostility. Western media, most notably the BBC's Persian Service, has long been regarded with deep distrust, fear and often hatred by the hardline Iranian establishment. For years Persian Service journalists have been harassed and intimidated by the Iranian authorities. Two months ago all the assets of 150 BBC staff, former staff and contributors were frozen for ""conspiracy against national security"". And here we come to the final part of the story of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe. Many years ago, she worked for BBC Media Action, the charitable wing of the BBC. Although it has no direct connection to the BBC's Persian service, it has been used as evidence that she was in Iran for political reasons. This video can not be played Mr Johnson called the Iranian foreign minister, Javad Zarif, about Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's case It is, therefore, for this reason that the recent comments by Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson were so controversial, and potentially damaging. By stating that she was involved in ""training journalists"", he has given ammunition to those elements of the establishment who view her as just another example what the supreme leader described as ""an infiltration project"" by the West. All the while, Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe languishes in Tehran's Evin jail. Her daughter, who has now forgotten how to speak English, can only see her for an hour-and-a-half a week. Meanwhile her husband Richard suffers in London. The future of a family, half-British, half-Iranian, has been torn apart by the suspicion and distrust caused by their own countries' pasts.

Iran's jailed dual nationals,"Most of the dual nationals imprisoned by Iran have been held at Tehran's notorious Evin prison The plight of British-Iranian woman Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who was arbitrarily detained for almost six years in Iran on spying charges that she strongly denied, focused attention on Iranians with dual nationality or foreign permanent residency being held in the Islamic Republic's prisons. Iran does not recognise dual nationality, and there are no exact figures on the number of such detainees given the sensitive nature of the information. Some of the most prominent are: Ahmadreza Djalali was sentenced to death in October 2017 The 51-year-old specialist in emergency medicine was arrested in April 2016 while on a business trip from Sweden. Amnesty International said Djalali washeld at Evin prison,externalby intelligence ministry officials for seven months, three of them in solitary confinement, before he was given access to a lawyer. He alleged that he was subjected to torture and other ill-treatment during that period, including threats to kill or otherwise harm his children, who live in Sweden, and his mother, who lives in Iran. In October 2017, a Revolutionary Court in Tehran convicted Djalali of ""spreading corruption on Earth"" and sentenced him to death. His lawyers said the court relied primarily on evidence obtained under duress and alleged that he was prosecuted solely because of his refusal to use his academic ties in European institutions to spy for Iran. 'My husband is facing execution in Iran' Two months later, Iranian state television also aired what it said was footage of Djalali confessing that he had spied on Iran's nuclear programme for Israel. It suggested he was responsible for identifying two Iranian nuclear scientists who were killed in bomb attacks in 2010. In February 2018, Sweden confirmed that it had given Djalali citizenship and demanded that his death sentence not be carried out. He had previously been a permanent resident. In November 2021, Djalali's wife, Vida Mehran-Nia, said he had been informed by prison authorities thathe faced imminent execution. He spent five months in solitary confinement, awaiting execution, until April 2021, when he reportedly was moved to a multi-occupancy cell. Just over a year later, an Iranian judiciary spokesman said Djalali's death sentence was ""final"" and was ""on the agenda"" of authorities. He also insisted that the case was not linked to the war crimes trial in Sweden of former Iranian judiciary official Hamid Nouri,who was sentenced to life in prisonover what prosecutors said was his leading role in the mass executions of Iranian opposition supporters in 1988. Djalali's wife and human rights groups have said Djalali is a ""hostage"" who Iran is threatening to execute in an attempt to negotiate a swap for Mr Nouri. Nahid Taghavi was an advocate for women's rights in Iran The 69-year-old retired architect, who is a German-Iranian dual national, was arrested at her apartment in Tehran in October 2020 and accused of ""endangering security"". She was placed in solitary confinement at Evin prison,externaland not given access to lawyers, German diplomats or members of her family, according to her daughter Mariam Claren. Taghavi was repeatedly subjected to coercive questioning without the presence of lawyers, according to Amnesty International. Interrogators reportedly asked her about meeting people to discuss women's and labour rights, and possessing literature about those issues. In August 2021, she was convicted by a Revolutionary Court in Tehran of ""forming a group composed of more than two people with the purpose of disrupting national security"" and ""spreading propaganda against the system"". She was sentenced to 10 years and eight months in prison. Taghavi had denied the charges, the first of which was apparently related to a social media account about women's rights, and Amnesty said the trial was ""grossly unfair"". Ms Claren wrote on Twitter,externalthat her mother ""did not commit any crime. Unless freedom of speech, freedom of thought are illegal"". She has said her mother has been denied adequate healthcare by prison and prosecution authorities, despite doctors saying in September 2021 that she needed surgery on her spinal column. In July 2022, Taghavi was granted urgent medical leave from prison for treatment for back and neck problems. She was sent back to Evin four months later. A fellow inmate in the prison warned in June 2023 that Taghavi's life was ""in danger"" following a further 220 days in solitary confinement. ""The pain is so severe that it can be clearly seen on her face. She can barely get out of her bed,""a message posted on human rights activist Narges Mohammadi's Instagram account said,external. Fariba Adelkhah's research focused on political and social anthropology The 64-year-old researcher at Sciences-Po university in Paris is a specialist in social anthropology and the political anthropology of post-revolutionary Iran, and has written a number of books. At the time of her arrest in Tehran in June 2019,external, she was examining the movement of Shia clerics between Afghanistan, Iran, and Iraq, and had spent time in the holy city of Qom. Adelkhah was accused of espionage and other security-related offences. She protested her innocence and after going on hunger strike, she was admitted to hospital for treatment for severe kidney damage. Prosecutors dropped the espionage charge before her trial began at the Revolutionary Court in April 2020. The following month, the court sentenced Adelkhah to five years in prisonfor conspiring against national securityand an additional year for propaganda against the establishment. French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian condemned the sentence and demanded her release. In October 2020, due to what Sciences-Po called her ""health circumstances"", Adelkhah was released on bail and allowed to return to her home in Tehran. However, Iran's judiciary announced in January 2022 that it hadreturned Adelkhah to prison,external, accusing her of ""knowingly violating the limits of house arrest dozens of times"". French President Emmanuel Macron called the decision ""entirely arbitrary"". In February 2023, AdelkhahAdelkhah was released from Evin prisonafter three and a half years in detention. However, Iranian authorities refused to return her identity papers, making it impossible for her to leave the country or resume her work as a researcher. Jamshid Sharmahd with his wife (L) and daughter, Gazelle Sharmahd, 68, a German citizen who lived in the US, arrived in the United Arab Emirates in July 2020 and was awaiting a connecting flight to India when he disappeared. It is believed that he was kidnapped by Iranian agents in Dubai and then forcibly taken to Iran via Oman. The following month, Iran's intelligence ministry announced that it had arrested Sharmahd following a ""complex operation"", without providing any details. It also published a video in which he appeared blindfolded and confessed to various crimes. In February 2023, Iran's judiciary said Sharmahd had beensentenced to deathby a Revolutionary Court in Tehran after being found guilty of ""spreading corruption on Earth through planning and leading terror operations"". It alleged that he was the leader of a terrorist group known as Tondar and that he had ""planned 23 terror attacks"", of which ""five were successful"", including the 2008 bombing of a mosque in Shiraz in that killed 14 people. Tondar - which means ""thunder"" in Persian - is another name of the Kingdom Assembly of Iran (KAI), a little-known US-based opposition group that seeks to restore the monarchy overthrown in the 1979 Islamic Revolution. According to Amnesty International, Sharmahd created a website to publish statements from the KAI, including claims of explosions inside Iran. He also read out statements in radio and video broadcasts. However, he denied his involvement in the attacks, saying he was only a spokesman, and rejected all accusations during his trial. Amnesty said Sharmahd told his family that he had been tortured and subjected to other ill-treatment in detention, including by being held in prolonged solitary confinement. He also told them that he had been denied adequate healthcare, with access to medications required for his Parkinson's disease delayed routinely. In July, Sharmahd's daughter Gazelle told the BBC that he could beexecuted at any time. ""They're killing him softly in solitary confinement in this death cell. But even if he survives that, they're killing him by hanging him from a crane in public."" Shahab Dalili The 61-year-old retired Iranian merchant navy captain is a US permanent resident. He has been detained in Iran since April 2016, when he visited Tehran to attend his father's funeral. He was later convicted of ""collaborating with a hostile state"" and sentenced to 10 years in prison. His wife - who is a US citizen - broke her silence in March 2022,saying in a video statement that he had been imprisoned unjustly for six years,externaland appealing to President Joe Biden to ""bring Shahab home"". In August 2023, his son, Darian, complained that he was not part of a prisoner exchange deal between the US and Iran, which saw five US-Iranian dual nationals released the following month. ""He feels betrayed. He is demoralized. He believes that the US would bring back anyone that they want to bring back,"" Darian told Reuters news agency. A US state department spokesman declined to tell reporters why Dalili was not included, but did reveal he had not yet been declared ""wrongfully detained"" - a designation that would mean the department dedicated more resources to their case and assigned it to a presidential envoy.

Reality Check: What next?,"If nothing is agreed until everything is agreed, then it is safe to say there is a long way to go. Phase one of the Brexit negotiations may be coming to an end, but phase two promises to be even more difficult. ""I very much welcome the prospect of moving ahead to the next phase,"" Theresa May said on Friday, ""to talk about trade and security and to discuss the positive and ambitious future relationship that is in all our interests."" Trade talks, I hear you cry? Not quite yet. For starters, negotiations on the divorce issues that we have learnt so much about have yet to be finalised. There are plenty of technical details that still need to be clarified, in parallel with any discussions about the future. Reality Check: Theresa May's deal with Brussels Listen: Brexitcast - there's a deal! Full text of the EU-UK statement,external In any case, the immediate priority will be to try to reach agreement on a transition period - for about two years after Brexit - in order to offer business a little more certainty, and everyone else a little more time. But there appear to be conflicting ideas about how any transition would work in practice. The Prime Minister has already accepted that existing EU rules and regulations would continue to apply. But she has also insisted that the UK will leave the single market and the customs union before a transition begins, on the day Brexit actually happens. The European Council's draft negotiating guidelines, due to be approved next week, see things rather differently. ""As you know,"" European Council President Donald Tusk said on Friday, ""the UK has asked for a transition of about two years, while remaining part of the single market and customs union."" Mr Tusk also emphasised that applying existing rules and regulations during a transition would not only mean the UK respecting the whole of EU law; the UK would also, he said, have to accept new laws without having any say in implementing them. In a further sign of trouble ahead, the European Council expects that the UK would continue to respect the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice during a transition, without having a British judge sitting on the court. None of this will, to put it mildly, go down well with Brexiteers at Westminster. And while this week has shown that compromise can be found, even in the most difficult of circumstances, there are some issues which cannot be solved by kicking the can down the road. Another big challenge during a transition period will be the fate of hundreds of agreements with third countries that apply to the UK at the moment precisely because it is a member of the European Union. These include free trade deals as well as numerous agreements on all types of regulatory co-operation. When the UK leaves the EU it will no longer be a legal part of any of these agreements - there is no way to roll them over automatically, and time to modify any of them to include the UK is already running extremely short. That's more than enough to be sorted out before we even start thinking about the outlines of a future relationship with the EU - on trade, security, foreign policy and other issues. The UK government wants to move on to start talking about trade Additional EU guidelines on the future relationship won't be published until next year anyway, and that means formal discussion of these issues may not begin for several months. Even then, the EU will not see them as proper trade talks. Internal EU documents talk of ""preliminary and preparatory discussions with the UK on a framework for the future relationship"" with the aim of agreeing a political declaration between the two sides by October 2018. A broad political discussion of that kind is a world away from a legal process leading to agreement on a new treaty. In the EU's legalistic world view, formal talks can only begin after Brexit, when the UK itself becomes a third country. ""Political agreements, with highfalutin aspirational guff, are one thing,"" said the former UK Permanent Representative to the EU, Ivan Rogers, in a recent lecture. ""Legally binding agreements, treaty changes and trade deal texts are another."" The UK government will hope to make progress more quickly, but it has yet to decide itself what kind of Brexit, and what kind of future relationship, it really wants. The cabinet is split between those who want to stay as close as possible to the EU's single market and all the regulations that implies, and those who argue that moving away from EU rules, and giving the UK the ability to strike out on its own, was one of the main aims of Brexit. Until that internal discussion produces a little more clarity, the EU will continue to proceed with caution. This has been a good week for the Brexit negotiations, real progress has been made. But when it comes to complexity, you ain't seen nothing yet.

Johnson in Iran for talks on jailed Briton,"Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe has been held in Iran since April 2016 Boris Johnson has held talks in Iran to press for the release of British-Iranian Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe. The UK foreign secretary met his Iranian counterpart Mohammad Javad Zarif to call for the release of the mother-of-one on humanitarian grounds, along with other dual nationals. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe has been held in Tehran since April 2016 after being accused of spying, which she denies. Mr Johnson's first visit to Iran comes amid rising tension in the Middle East. On Saturday afternoon he will meet the speaker of the Iranian parliament and the secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council. BBC diplomatic correspondent James Robbins said Mr Johnson is expected to emphasise Britain's continuing support for the international nuclear deal with Iran, but he will also make clear Britain's concerns about some of Iran's activities, notably in Yemen and Syria. Our correspondent said Mr Johnson's trip to Tehran - only the third made by a UK foreign secretary since 2003 - could ""hardly be more sensitive"". Mr Johnson did not speak to reporters before going into the meeting with Mohammad Javad Zarif He added that Mr Johnson had been careful to lower any expectations of imminent release for 37-year-old Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, warning that such cases are very difficult. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe: Caught in Iran power struggle The uncertain fate of Iran's jailed dual nationals Global powers defy US over Iran deal shift Mr Ratcliffe met with Mr Johnson to discuss his wife's case earlier this year Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was arrested during a holiday visit to enable her parents to meet her baby daughter Gabriella. After the arrest her daughter's passport was confiscated and for the last 20 months she has been living with her maternal grandparents in Iran. By Frank Gardner, BBC security correspondent in Bahrain Even before Boris Johnson took off for Tehran, the foreign office wisely lowered expectations of an immediate release of the imprisoned dual national Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe. The Iranians will have prepared very carefully for this visit, as they have concerns and demands of their own. In Iran there is a pervading sense that the West is not fully living up to its side of the bargain in the 2015 Vienna nuclear deal. Flows of money through London, for example, are still restricted and the hoped-for economic dividend has failed to materialise for many Iranians. Complicating matters for Boris Johnson is the fact that there are essentially 'two Irans'. There is the elected government, which he has been meeting today. Then there is the deep state: the Revolutionary Guards Corps, the judiciary and the intelligence and security apparatus, all of which are hostile to the West and likely to impose a hard line on any negotiations. Mr Johnson was accused of risking an additional five years being added to her sentence when he told a parliamentary committee that she had been in Iran to train journalists. In November,he apologised in the Commons, retracting ""any suggestion she was there in a professional capacity"". Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe with her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, and daughter, Gabriella Mr Johnson then met with her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, to discuss her case, including calls for her to be given diplomatic protection. Mr Ratcliffe told The Guardian,externalthat he was ""waiting on tenterhooks, biting my nails"", ahead of Mr Johnson's visit. There have beenconcerns about Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's healthafter lumps in her breasts were discovered, but those were found to be non-cancerous. Tulip Siddiq, Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's MP, said she had been told by the Foreign Office that Mr Johnson probably would not be able to secure her imminent release. ""It was made very clear that we shouldn't expect any miracles,"" the MP for Hampstead and Kilburn said. Although not mentioning her by name, Mr Johnson said: ""I will stress my grave concerns about our dual national consular cases and press for their release where there are humanitarian grounds to do so."" The Foreign Office would not confirm the names or number of other people being held in Iran, saying their families had asked for their cases to be kept out of the public domain. In addition, the BBC hasissued a statement on Twitter,external, urging Mr Johnson to raise the case of the BBC Persian staff during his visit. The BBC Persian Service has long been viewed with hostility by hardline Iranians. Two months ago, Iranian authorities launched an investigation into 152 present and former journalists and staff, accusing them of conspiracy against national security. The BBC News Press Team called upon Iran ""to stop the harassment and persecution of our staff and their families"".

He also said he would underline theUK's support for the 2015 nuclear deal- struck between Iran and six world powers - but ""make clear"" concerns over the country's activity. Mr Johnson added: ""Iran is a significant country in a strategically important, but volatile and unstable, region which matters to the UK's security and prosperity. ""While our relationship with Iran has improved significantly since 2011, it is not straightforward and on many issues we will not agree. ""But I am clear that dialogue is the key to managing our differences and, where possible, making progress on issues that really matter, even under difficult conditions.""

Gove says voters can change Brexit deal,"Michael Gove says: ""Nothing is agreed until everything is agreed"" Voters can use the next general election to have their say on a final Brexit deal, Michael Gove has said. The environment secretary praised Theresa May's ""tenacity and skill"" in securing a last-minute deal to end phase one negotiations on Friday. But,writing in the Daily Telegraph,external, he said if British people ""dislike the arrangement"", they can change it. Reports suggest the cabinet will meet on 19 December to discuss its ""end state"" plans for Brexit. This is just two days before Parliament's two-week Christmas recess. Kuenssberg: Theresa May buys breathing space So, did 'soft Brexit' just win? Brexit: All you need to know Mr Gove, one of the cabinet's leading Brexiteers, said the primary agreement between the two sides had ""set the scene for phase two"" negotiations - where issues such as trade will be discussed. But he said that ""nothing is agreed until everything is agreed"" at the end of the process. After a two-year transition period, the UK would be able to pass laws with ""full freedom to diverge from EU law on the single market and customs union,"" he added. And the British people would ""be in control"" to make the government change direction if they were unhappy, he said. ""By the time of the next election, EU law and any new treaty with the EU will cease to have primacy or direct effect in UK law,"" said Mr Gove. ""If the British people dislike the arrangement that we have negotiated with the EU, the agreement will allow a future government to diverge."" The next general election is currently due to be held in 2022, three years after the UK leaves the EU. However, it could be sooner if the prime minister calls one, and MPs agree to it, or if the government collapses. The former Conservative leader, Iain Duncan Smith, said the next phase - the trade discussions - would be the ""bruising but vital bit"". European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said Friday's deal was a ""breakthrough"" and he was confident EU leaders would approve it at a European Council summit next week. Theresa May and Jean-Claude Juncker agreed a deal early on Friday Citizens' rights:Three million EU citizens currently in the UK would be allowed to continue living and working there. Those already in the country, without permanent residency, would be able to acquire it after Brexit. The one million or so UK citizens living in an EU country after Brexit would get the same rights, under the agreement. It also includes reunification rights for relatives who do not live in the UK to join them in their host country in the future Money:The so-called ""divorce bill"" will amount to between Â£35bn and Â£39bn, Downing Street sources say. This includes budget contributions during a two-year ""transition"" period after the UK leaves the EU in March 2019. The precise figure is unlikely to be known for some time. Irish border:There will be no ""hard border"" between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic. The UK government and the EU want to maintain the free flow of goods, without border checks that they fear could threaten a return to The Troubles, but the DUP does not want Northern Ireland to be treated differently to the rest of the UK after Brexit. The joint EU-UK document says any future deal must protect ""North-South co-operation"" and hold to the UK's ""guarantee of avoiding a hard border"". The agreement also says ""no new regulatory barriers"" will be allowed between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, and that Northern Ireland's businesses will continue to have ""unfettered access"" to the UK internal market - a passage thought to have been added to meet DUP concerns. But it also sets out a fallback position if the UK fails to agree a trade deal. This could prove controversial because it says there will continue to be ""full alignment"" between the EU and Northern Ireland on some elements of cross-border trade, as set out in the Good Friday Agreement. Full text of EU-UK statement,external Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, whose opposition on Monday led to talks with the EU breaking down, said there was still ""more work to be done"" on the border issue and how it voted on the final deal would ""depend on its contents"". Barry Gardiner, Labour's international trade secretary, called the agreement on the Irish border issue a ""fudge"", saying Mrs May appeared to have contradictory red lines. His party wanted to see an agreement which harmed neither the settlement, nor the economic situation, he said. Justice minister Dominic Raab said the details of how to deal with the issue of the Irish border had still to be worked out in full. ""You can call it strategic ambiguity, you can call it constructive ambiguity... what I am admitting to you, very openly, and honestly, is that we have agreed principles, but that the details still need to be ironed out on this very bespoke set of issues around Northern Ireland which can't be dealt with properly and responsibly outside of the context of the broader negotiation on customs and trade and all of those other things we have said all along,"" he told BBC 2's Newsnight. Leave campaigner Andrea Leadsom, leader of the Commons, said the overall deal was a ""significant achievement"" for the prime minister. ""People on all sides of the argument are now seeing that she is determined and is succeeding in making a success of leaving the EU,"" she said. Fellow Leave campaigner Iain Duncan Smith said it had been fascinating to see the EU's reaction after failing to secure a deal in Brussels on Monday. ""They realised they were staring down the eyes of a no-deal, and so they got into action for the first time for many months, and literally drove with the UK government the changes that were necessary to get this thing on track. ""Why? The EU recognises that they really do need and want a free trade arrangement with the UK,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Liberal Democrat leader Vince Cable said Mr Gove wanted to deny the public the right to block a poor deal and the only way to give people control was for a vote on the terms of the deal, with the option to exit from Brexit. Sir Andrew Cahn, a former head of UK trade and investment, said it was ""simply not true"" that the EU had blinked first. It was, he said, the UK which had done so by agreeing to pay more money and by fudging the Northern Ireland issue. He said the UK had done the ""easy bit"" and now it had to decide what sort of arrangement it wanted with the EU, which has not been done yet. On Friday, the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, said the UK was ""closing doors"" on its future relationship with the EU by laying down ""red lines"" in the negotiation, including leaving the customs unions and the single market. They leave the UK with only one way forward, he suggested -  a free trade agreement on the Canadian model. ""It is not us, it is the British government, which is indicating these red lines that is closing certain doors. That is the model we are going to have to work on,"" he said. Would Canada's deal with the EU be a good model for the UK? What other models could the UK follow? This video can not be played Brexit: What still needs to be worked out? There are plenty of technical details in Friday's agreement that still need to be clarified, which will have to happen in parallel with any discussions about the future. If EU leaders approve the agreement at an EU Council summit next week, talks can then move on to a transition deal to cover a period of up to two years after Brexit and the ""framework for the future relationship"" - preliminary discussions about a future trade deal. However, the EU says a deal can only be finalised once the UK has left the EU in March 2019. Before that, the UK government has to decide what kind of Brexit, and what kind of future relationship with the EU, it really wants. The cabinet is split between those who want to stay as close as possible to the EU's single market and all the regulations that implies, and those who argue that moving away from EU rules, and giving the UK the ability to strike out on its own, was one of the main aims of Brexit. A final withdrawal treaty and transition deal will have to be ratified by the EU nations and the UK Parliament, before the UK leaves. Reality Check: What next for talks?

Archbishop criticises grammar schools,"Justin Welby says governments should not look to the past to improve education The Archbishop of Canterbury has criticised grammar schools as ""contrary to the notion of the common good"". Speaking in the House of Lords, the Most Rev Justin Welby called for education to focus on ""drawing the best out of every person"", rather than a selective approach. He said governments should not look to the past and ""waste our time rummaging there for the solutions of tomorrow."" Some Tory MPs said grammar schools offer ""invaluable opportunities"". What now for grammar schools? First 'new' grammar school in 50 years Grammar schools: What are they? The archbishop led a debate on education, saying the country was now in a ""fourth digital revolution"" and schools had one of the ""greatest challenges"" in tackling the ""seismic shift"" when it comes to preparing children for the future. However, he said ""children of privilege continue to inherit privilege"" and the system was not acting in a way to help everyone. ""The academic selective approach to education, one which prioritises separation as a necessary precondition for the nurture of excellence, makes a statement about the purpose of education that is contrary to the notion of the common good,"" the archbishop said. ""An approach that neglects those of lesser ability or because of a misguided notion of levelling out does not give the fullest opportunity to those of highest ability or does not enable all to develop a sense of community and mutuality."" His comments have been denounced by some MPs who back the schools. Conservative Andrew Bridgentold the Daily Mail,external: ""[Mr Welby] is obviously entitled to his own views, but the evidence is that grammar schools are a great way for under-privileged children to escape poverty. ""It is well known that they provide social mobility for the under-privileged."" Fellow Conservative MP Conor Burns also told the newspaper: ""Many grammar school provide invaluable opportunities for children from both poor and rich backgrounds, and give them the opportunities they may not otherwise have."" In 2016, Theresa May outlined plans to introduce a ""new generation"" of grammar schools by 2020, removing the ban introduced by Labour in 1997. However, after the general election in June - and without a majority in Parliament -the government scrapped the plans, saying instead they would ""look at all options"" for opening new schools, without removing the ban.

Uber settles defamation lawsuit over rape,"Uber driver Shiv Kumar Yadav was sentenced to life in prison over the rape Uber has agreed to settle a US civil lawsuit with a woman who accused its executives of improperly obtaining her medical records after she was raped by a driver in India. The lawsuit, which follows on from a crime committed in 2014, cited media reports where officials at the firm were said to have doubted her account. The Indian woman was living in the US when she filed the lawsuit. The Uber driver was sentenced to life in prison for the rape in 2015. In December 2014, the 26-year-old Delhi woman, who later moved to Texas, filed a case anonymously in which she said she had been kidnapped and raped by Shiv Kumar Yadav. She had used the Uber smartphone app to book a taxi home but said she had been taken by Yadav to a secluded area and raped. Yadav was sentenced to life in prison following a criminal case in India. As well as the court case, the woman sued Uber and settled out of court. However,she filed a new suit in the US after reports emerged that Uber had investigated the complaint, obtained her medical records and speculated that she made up the claims to hurt the firm's business. She alleged in the lawsuit that Uber had violated her privacy and defamed her character. The lawsuit, which was settled in San Francisco where Uber has its headquarters, also said the company had kept a copy of the woman's medical records. Uber: Scandals that drove Kalanick out What do we know about Uber's new boss? Uber concealed huge data breach Several media reports cited in the lawsuit said that senior staff at the ride-hailing company, including Travis Kalanick, the former Uber chief executive who was ousted in June this year, and former executives Emil Michael and Eric Alexander, had questioned the victim's account of her ordeal. ""Uber executives duplicitously and publicly decried the rape, expressing sympathy for the plaintiff, and shock and regret at the violent attack, while privately speculating, as outlandish as it is, that she had colluded with a rival company to harm Uber's business,"" the lawsuit said. At the time the later lawsuit was filed, an Uber spokesperson said: ""No one should have to go through a horrific experience like this, and we're truly sorry that she's had to relive it over the last few weeks."" Theplaintiff dropped Emil Michael,externalfrom her complaint in October before settling the case. Terms of the latest settlement have not been disclosed. It comes as the new CEO of Uber, Dara Khosrowshahi, is trying to clean up the image of the company, which has been plagued by scandals and lawsuits.

Man stripped in 50-hour kidnap ordeal,"This video can not be played CCTV of two men wanted in connection with the kidnap and burglary A man was stripped naked, beaten and tied up in a kidnapping ordeal that lasted 50 hours. The 24-year-old victim was lured to a house in Thornton Heath, Croydon by two acquaintances, where he was set upon by an armed gang. His keys were taken by the gang who burgled his parents' home. As well as the man's Â£9,000 Rolex watch, a significant amount of cash was taken from the property in Sydenham, south-east London, police said. The captors had previously forced the man to ring his parents and make a ransom demand for his release, which they could not pay. On Wednesday, which was the third evening of the hostage ordeal, the victim was taken by car to a Metro bank cash machine in North End, Croydon, so he could withdraw money. His tormentors waited in the vehicle, apparently out of fear of being captured on CCTV, giving the man an opportunity to escape. Det Sgt Samuel Bennett, of the Croydon Criminal Investigation Department, said: ""This was a vicious and prolonged attack of a nature that thankfully is very rare. ""It has left the victim utterly distraught and traumatised."" The entry of two suspects into the home of the victim's parents was captured on CCTV. The footage has now been released by police in a bid to identify them. Detectives have also named two other men they want to speak to in connection with the man's ordeal - two brothers, Ali Dervish, 28, and 19-year-old Sinan Dervish.

As Mr Macron addressed the large crowd gathered at the church, many of whom were in tears, they chanted: ""Johnny, Johnny, Johnny Hallyday."" Many of those gathered outside the church became emotional during the tributes Fans had earlier gathered outside the star's home in Marnes-la-Coquette, west of Paris Some of the musician's fans have demanded that a monument be built in recognition of his achievements. Others have expressed disappointment at news that Hallyday is likely to be buried on the French Caribbean island of St Barts, where he had his home. One fan, Francois Le Lay, told AFP news agency: ""We would have preferred if he was buried in Paris, but if Johnny wanted that, we will respect it. ""My wife and I will put the money aside that we would have spent going to  his concerts so we can fly to Saint Barts one day."" On Friday, the Eiffel Tower was lit up with the words ""Merci Johnny"". At the famous L'Olympia music venue in Paris where Hallyday once enjoyed a three-week residency to mark 40 years in show business, the singer's name was displayed as a tribute. The Eiffel Tower displays the message ""Merci Johnny"" (Thank you Johnny) L'Olympia, one of Paris's oldest surviving music halls, pays tribute The star, whose real name was Jean-Philippe Smet, sold more than 110 million records and starred in a number of films, including one directed by Jean-Luc Godard. He once performed before a million people in a mobile musical cavalcade down the Champs-Elysees. However despite 6,000 fans chartering flights from Paris to see him play Las Vegas in 1996, he failed to crack the American or any other English-speaking market. The singer, who was once condemned as the rock 'n' roll ""corrupter of youth"", was often referred to as ""the French Elvis"" by critics.

Iraq declares war with IS is over,"Recapturing Mosul was the bloodiest conflict - for both combatants and civilians Iraq has announced that its war against so-called Islamic State (IS) is over. Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi told a conference in Baghdad that Iraqi troops were now in complete control of the Iraqi-Syrian border. The border zone contained the last few areas IS held, following its loss of the town of Rawa in November. The US state department welcomed the end of the ""vile occupation"" of IS in Iraq and said the fight against the group would continue. Iraq's announcement comes two days after the Russian military declared it had accomplished its mission of defeating IS in neighbouring Syria. Is IS losing control of its 'virtual caliphate'? Which countries have fleeing IS fighters gone to? What should happen to IS fighters in Syria and Iraq? How real is the threat of returning IS fighters? The jihadist group had seized large swathes of Syria and Iraq in 2014, when it proclaimed a ""caliphate"" and imposed its rule over some 10 million people. But it suffered a series of defeats over the past two years, losing Iraq's second city of Mosul this July and its de facto capital of Raqqa in northern Syria last month. Some IS fighters are reported to have dispersed into the Syrian countryside, while others are believed to have escaped across the Turkish border. By Sebastian Usher, BBC Arab affairs editor This is undeniably a proud moment for Mr Abadi - a victory that once looked like it might only ever be rhetorical rather than real. But if the direct military war with IS in Iraq is genuinely over, and the country's elite forces can now step back after a conflict that's taken a huge toll on them, it doesn't mean the battle against the group's ideology or its ability to stage an insurgency is finished - whether in Iraq, Syria or the wider world. Attacks may be at a lower level than they once were, but Iraqi towns and cities still fall prey to suicide bombers, while the conditions that fuelled the growth of jihadism remain - even in the territory that's been recaptured. Mr Abadi said on Saturday: ""Our forces are in complete control of the Iraqi-Syrian border and I therefore announce the end of the war against Daesh [IS]. ""Our enemy wanted to kill our civilisation, but we have won through our unity and our determination. We have triumphed in little time."" The Iraqi armed forces issued a statement saying Iraq had been ""totally liberated"" from IS. US state department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement that Iraqis who had lived under the jihadists' ""brutal control"" were now free.,external ""The United States joins the government of Iraq in stressing that Iraq's liberation does not mean the fight against terrorism, and even against Isis [IS], in Iraq is over,"" she added. UK Prime Minister Theresa May congratulated Mr Abadi on a ""historic moment"" but warned that IS still posed a threat, including from across the border in Syria. Last month, the Syrian military said it had ""fully liberated"" the eastern border town of Albu Kamal, the last last urban stronghold of IS in that country. On Thursday, the head of the Russian general staff's operations, Col-Gen Sergei Rudskoi, said: ""The mission to defeat bandit units of the Islamic State terrorist organisation on the territory of Syria, carried out by the armed forces of the Russian Federation, has been accomplished."" Estimates of civilian deaths in Mosul alone vary wildly, with one figure as high as 40,000 He said Russia's military presence in Syria would now concentrate on preserving ceasefires and restoring peace. The collapse of IS has raised fears that its foreign fighters will escape over Syria's borders to carry out more attacks abroad.

Businesses face ruin in California fires,"This video can not be played The wildfires have devastated parts of southern California Much of California's avocado crop has been destroyed by wildfires that have ripped through the southern part of the state, industry experts say. ""We've lost at least several hundred acres of avocados, probably more,""the California Avocado Commission told agriculture news site AgNet West.,external About 90% of US avocados are grown in California, and the industry is worth millions to the economy. About 5,700 firefighters have been battling the fires, officials say. California wildfire flames seen from space Powerful images of the fires One death has been confirmed - that of a 70-year-old woman found in her car on Wednesday. Three firefighters have been injured and about 500 buildings destroyed. There are now fears the fires will have serious implications for California's vast agricultural industry. Last season's avocado harvest produced a crop worth more than $400m (Â£300m), according to the California Avocado Commission. Much of this was grown on family-owned farms in the south of the state. A firefighter tackles a blaze at an avocado orchard near Ojai, California Ventura County, which is California's largest growing region for avocados, has seen the worst of the fires with 180 square miles (466 sq km) consumed, according to officials. John Krist, chief executive of the Ventura County Farm Bureau, told Reuters news agency: ""A lot of that fruit everybody was looking forward to harvesting next year is lying on the ground."" Food safety regulations mean the crop cannot be sold once it falls from the tree. This video can not be played Drivers filmed the flames from their cars near Bel Air The fires mean the upcoming harvest, which usually takes place in February or March, is likely to be smaller than usual. However experts say it too soon to assess the full extent of the damage. Elsewhere, US President Donald Trump has declared a state of emergency, which will free up funding to ""help alleviate the hardship and suffering that the emergency may inflict on the local population"". Nearly 200,000 residents have been evacuated from their homes as firefighters battle the wildfires on several fronts. Governor Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency in San Diego on Thursday after a new blaze spread from 10 acres to 4,100 acres in just a few hours. Authorities have issued a purple alert - the highest level warning - amid what they have called ""extremely critical fire weather"". The powerful desert-heated Santa Ana winds have been fanning the flames.

Johnson to voice concerns for jailed Briton,"Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe has been held in Iran since April 2016 Boris Johnson has held talks in Iran to press for the release of British-Iranian Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe. The UK foreign secretary met his Iranian counterpart Mohammad Javad Zarif to call for the release of the mother-of-one on humanitarian grounds, along with other dual nationals. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe has been held in Tehran since April 2016 after being accused of spying, which she denies. Mr Johnson's first visit to Iran comes amid rising tension in the Middle East. On Saturday afternoon he will meet the speaker of the Iranian parliament and the secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council. BBC diplomatic correspondent James Robbins said Mr Johnson is expected to emphasise Britain's continuing support for the international nuclear deal with Iran, but he will also make clear Britain's concerns about some of Iran's activities, notably in Yemen and Syria. Our correspondent said Mr Johnson's trip to Tehran - only the third made by a UK foreign secretary since 2003 - could ""hardly be more sensitive"". Mr Johnson did not speak to reporters before going into the meeting with Mohammad Javad Zarif He added that Mr Johnson had been careful to lower any expectations of imminent release for 37-year-old Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, warning that such cases are very difficult. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe: Caught in Iran power struggle The uncertain fate of Iran's jailed dual nationals Global powers defy US over Iran deal shift Mr Ratcliffe met with Mr Johnson to discuss his wife's case earlier this year Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was arrested during a holiday visit to enable her parents to meet her baby daughter Gabriella. After the arrest her daughter's passport was confiscated and for the last 20 months she has been living with her maternal grandparents in Iran. By Frank Gardner, BBC security correspondent in Bahrain Even before Boris Johnson took off for Tehran, the foreign office wisely lowered expectations of an immediate release of the imprisoned dual national Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe. The Iranians will have prepared very carefully for this visit, as they have concerns and demands of their own. In Iran there is a pervading sense that the West is not fully living up to its side of the bargain in the 2015 Vienna nuclear deal. Flows of money through London, for example, are still restricted and the hoped-for economic dividend has failed to materialise for many Iranians. Complicating matters for Boris Johnson is the fact that there are essentially 'two Irans'. There is the elected government, which he has been meeting today. Then there is the deep state: the Revolutionary Guards Corps, the judiciary and the intelligence and security apparatus, all of which are hostile to the West and likely to impose a hard line on any negotiations. Mr Johnson was accused of risking an additional five years being added to her sentence when he told a parliamentary committee that she had been in Iran to train journalists. In November,he apologised in the Commons, retracting ""any suggestion she was there in a professional capacity"". Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe with her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, and daughter, Gabriella Mr Johnson then met with her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, to discuss her case, including calls for her to be given diplomatic protection. Mr Ratcliffe told The Guardian,externalthat he was ""waiting on tenterhooks, biting my nails"", ahead of Mr Johnson's visit. There have beenconcerns about Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's healthafter lumps in her breasts were discovered, but those were found to be non-cancerous. Tulip Siddiq, Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's MP, said she had been told by the Foreign Office that Mr Johnson probably would not be able to secure her imminent release. ""It was made very clear that we shouldn't expect any miracles,"" the MP for Hampstead and Kilburn said. Although not mentioning her by name, Mr Johnson said: ""I will stress my grave concerns about our dual national consular cases and press for their release where there are humanitarian grounds to do so."" The Foreign Office would not confirm the names or number of other people being held in Iran, saying their families had asked for their cases to be kept out of the public domain. In addition, the BBC hasissued a statement on Twitter,external, urging Mr Johnson to raise the case of the BBC Persian staff during his visit. The BBC Persian Service has long been viewed with hostility by hardline Iranians. Two months ago, Iranian authorities launched an investigation into 152 present and former journalists and staff, accusing them of conspiracy against national security. The BBC News Press Team called upon Iran ""to stop the harassment and persecution of our staff and their families"". This video can not be played Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe speaks on phone during march In his statement, the foreign secretary listed topics he would raise with his Iranian counterpart, Mohammad Javad Zarif, including finding a political solution to the conflict in Yemen and securing ""greater humanitarian access to ease the immense suffering there"". He also said he would underline theUK's support for the 2015 nuclear deal- struck between Iran and six world powers - but ""make clear"" concerns over the country's activity. Mr Johnson added: ""Iran is a significant country in a strategically important, but volatile and unstable, region which matters to the UK's security and prosperity. ""While our relationship with Iran has improved significantly since 2011, it is not straightforward and on many issues we will not agree. ""But I am clear that dialogue is the key to managing our differences and, where possible, making progress on issues that really matter, even under difficult conditions.""

Stormzy is BBC Music's artist of the yearThe grime artist caps a huge year by taking home the main prize at the 2017 BBC Music Awards.14h14 hours agoEntertainment & Arts,"Stormzy made the transition from underground success to household name in 2017 Stormzy has been named artist of the year at the 2017 BBC Music Awards, capping a hugely successful year. The south London MC, whose debut album Gang Signs & Prayer was the first grime record to reach number one, beat Ed Sheeran and Lorde to the prize. He adds it to a collection that already includes three Mobos and the Q Award for best solo artist. Rag N Bone Man collected album of the year, while Foo Fighters won best live performance for their Glastonbury set. This video can not be played Highlights of Foo Fighters' set at Glastonbury 2017 The US band headlined the festival this June, two years after they were forced to pull out when frontman Dave Grohl broke his leg. Taking to the stage this summer, Grohl blamed the delay on ""bad traffic"", before launching into a blistering, hit-filled set. Their performance eventually overran by 20 minutes because the crowd kept singing between songs. Foo Fighters finally headline Glastonbury Stormzy: Seven things you need to know Rag N Bone Man interview (BBC Sound of 2017) Declan McKenna wins BBC Introducing prize ""It really did just turn into this one big ball of love and energy and celebration and music,"" Grohl said as he collected the BBC Music Award.

This year's BBC Music Award winners pose with their trophies Rag N Bone Man's prize came in recognition of his debut album Human, which is the year's biggest-selling debut. ""That's a proper good award,"" he said. ""I keep thinking at one point that someone is going to fishhook me off and tell me it's a joke, but it's not, and it's a wonderful thing to have."" In previous years, the BBC Music Awards have been handed out at a glitzy televised arena concert, with performances from the likes of One Direction, Little Mix and Robbie Williams. However, after disappointing ratings (2016's show was watched by 2.7 million people) this year's awards were handed out during a a one-hour BBC Two special titledThe Year In Music 2017.

"Royal pleasure, parties and politics","There is something hauntingly contemporary about this exhibition. It starts with a disgruntled England, which has made a cataclysmic decision to break with an imperfect but effective Europe-entwined institution that has been the basis for the country's social, economic, and political life. We'd be better off without 'em, is the feeling. The Irish and Scots are not so sure, but the will of a group of charismatic and self-righteous metropolitan politicians prevails, and people are warily readying themselves for a collective leap into the dark. The population is divided on the matter, split like a pair of cheap trousers. The fact is this scepter'd isle is going to be run differently from now on. We stand poised. It is mid December. But we are not in 2017. We are in 1649 and, like it or not, the country is going to be a republic. The old monarchical system along with its network of tactical intercontinental marriages is over. Oliver Cromwell and his New Model Army rule, OK. Charles I, by Edward Bower, is the first painting in the exhibition Which brings us to the first painting in the show where we meet Charles I shortly before his execution, commissioned, apparently, by Cromwell and his chums. The incarcerated King looks wizard-like, nonchalant, and inwardly majestic. It is a respectful seated portrait suggesting the God-fearing Parliamentarian was uncomfortable doing away with a man widely believed to be hot-wired to God. It didn't stop him, though. As we see in an explicitly detailed image called The Execution of Charles I. This gory print became an instant blockbuster; a bloodthirsty hit both at home and throughout an intrigued and amazed Europe. Alongside it is a copy of a small book with a big title, Eikon Basilike: The Pourtraicture of His Sacred Majestie in His Solitudes and Sufferings. This is important. It is basically a mix of memoire, prayer, and personal statement, probably - but not definitely - written by Charles I shortly before his public beheading at Whitehall. What is certain is the date of its publication 10 days after the event, when it quickly became a bestseller and in-turn a cunning piece of beyond the grave Royalist propaganda. Maybe the King wasn't so bad after all. Maybe he was a martyr. And look at that lovely little woodcut image of him blessing his divine son as his chosen successor. The Restoration had begun in people's minds less than two weeks into the new Commonwealth. The exhibition then jump cuts to 1660 and the return of the exiled Charles II. The Coronation of King Charles II in Westminster Abbey, by Wenceslaus Hollar Backed with parliamentary cash, the soon-to-be crowned King has been out on a shopping spree to replace all the regalia and formal royal tableware Cromwell had melted down and flogged off. It is a fine line the young man has to walk. His purchases need to be glitzy enough to impress and cement his status and legitimacy. But they can't be as flashy as the stuff his French cousin Louis XIV buys because: a) it might go down badly with the public and cost him his head, and b) he can't afford it. He opts for silver gilt, which nearly 360 years later still looks magnificent. The craftsmanship and quality of the plates, candlesticks, chalices, and salts are impressive. As is an exquisitely embroidered bible given to the newly restored King, signalling a more liberal, post-Cromwellian, era. The brakes are off. Theatres are re-opened. Charles II, painted by John Michael Wright, is a powerful image of the monarchy restored Charles II takes on a coterie of lovers (including the saucily depicted actress Nell Gwyn), and poses for a huge portrait by John Michael Wright. What the painting lacks in terms of technique - which is quite a lot - it more than makes up for with size and visual impact. It is designed to establish the new King as the top man. We see him sitting in an elevated position, wearing the crown of state, and sporting his Order of the Garter costume under Parliament robes. He is holding his newly acquired orb and sceptre. The idea is to hark back to Tudor and Elizabethan styles to imply stability through continuity. Frankly, he looks ridiculous; like an aging rock-star who has been allowed to rummage around in the royal dressing up box. Leonardo da Vinci's Oak and dyer's greenweed, from circa 1505-10 It sums up what quickly becomes apparent in this show, which is Charles II was not blessed with the same curatorial eye as his late father. OK he acquired some wonderful drawings by Leonardo, Michelangelo and Holbein - some of which are on display. But when it came to the task of retrieving the great paintings Cromwell sold off, or commissioning new pictures, he comes up short. He did make a few decent purchases. The Massacre of the Innocents by Pieter Bruegel the Elder You'll see a very good Pieter Bruegel the Elder painting called The Massacre of the Innocents. Although, it is slightly odd in so much as there are no innocents being massacred. There were originally, but when the Habsburg Emperor, Rudolf II, owned the painting he recognised the occupying troops as his own (specifically depicted as such by Bruegel, who was making a political point) and had all the dead babies painted out. The upshot is a scene in which women are bent over, crying their eyes out over loaves of bread and various poultry. If you're after an exhibition stuffed to its royal gunnels with painterly masterpieces, the chances are you'll be underwhelmed by Charles II: Art & Power and should wait until January when the Royal Academy will do what he didn't and reunite much of his father's collection. If, however, you are in the market for a richly told, thought-provoking history lesson that feels surprisingly relevant in today's Brexit Britain, with the added bonus that its central protagonist looks like Brian May from Queen, then you might consider the Â£11 ticket price as money well spent. Charles II: Art and Power is at The Queen's Gallery, Buckingham Palace, London SW1A.

Kuenssberg: May buys breathing space,"The prime minister made her decisions on Thursday night while the No 10 Downing Street Christmas party carried on. It isn't celebration on Friday though for her government, but relief. And her allies note that in those fraught hours she made thedecision to go to Brusselseven though the DUP had continued to make its objections known, despite the progress it had secured. That may be a comfort to her internal critics who believe that Theresa May is all too often a prisoner of circumstance rather than a bold decision maker. And after a rocky few months, Downing Street can breathe out, for once, because it reached a critical short-term goal, moving on from Monday's embarrassment to a temporary conclusion. And it matters so much. Brexit is the biggest political and policy project any British government has undertaken for many, many years. As the leader of the government pursuing the policy, the prime minister's own record rises and falls with the progress of our departure from the EU. Simply, while No 10 always maintains that she wants to focus on domestic reforms, Mrs May's fate is intertwined with these negotiations. The deal was sealed at an early hours breakfast meeting on Friday The talks stumble, and so does she. The negotiators muddle through, so does her leadership. And the deal at dawn mutes the criticism of her inside her party, and restores some of the faith perhaps in Brussels. Had it not been struck, had she not made the decision to get on the plane, there would have been serious rumblings in her party. It might not have been the end of her leadership. There are plenty of hopeful leadership contenders, but few who would be guaranteed to put their head above the parapet to try to push her out. But critical Brexiteers have been conspicuous by their absence. And Remainers are relieved that she has, as they see it, been firm in the face of some of their and the DUP's demands, and left the route pointing to asofter Brexit. In truth, so much has not been agreed. This is a document that to a large extent, resolves to solve problems and contradictions together in the future. The document contains more ambiguities than pages. And as with any compromises there are some losses, and some victories. Over time those fault lines will appear. The two sides of the Tories' internal debates over Europe have not suddenly met in the middle. The brooding clash has been delayed, again, allowing the prime minister to press on into the next phase.

"So, did 'soft Brexit' just win?Reality Check: Where next for talks?What does deal mean for NI?","The agreement commits both sides to an open border between Northern Ireland and the Republic ""The test of a first-rate intelligence,"" F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote in The Crack-Up, ""is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time, and still retain the ability to function."" Today the British government and the European Union are making a fist of passing that test. Reading the joint report between the UK and the EU, it is clear that the most important section when considering the economics of Brexit is the section on Ireland. The document commits both sides to an open border between Northern Ireland and the Republic, and that there will be ""no new regulatory barriers"" between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. It also commits to the UK leaving the EU's single market and customs union. These two positions appear to be in contradiction. If Britain does become a ""third country"" - that is trading with the EU as other non-EU countries outside the single market and the customs union do - then border controls will be necessary. And that open border will become very much more closed. Full text of the EU-UK statement,external Business calls for more clarity Reality Check: What key lines really mean Brexit: All you need to know There is at least a partial way around this conundrum. And it necessitates the comprehensive free trade deal the British government has said it wants. And at least closely mirroring customs arrangements we presently adhere to as members of the EU's customs union. That equates for many with a ""soft Brexit"" and is the trajectory many economists argue would be best for the UK economy. This is because, if there is no free trade agreement, it is difficult to see how Theresa May's government could maintain ""full alignment with the rules of the internal market and the customs union which support north-south co-operation [on the island of Ireland]"" which the joint report commits the PM to. And still say that Britain has left the EU. This document has been described as the ""withdrawal deal"". But it is actually far more importantly a signal of what the future might hold. And that appears to be a relationship where the UK closely follows the EU's single market and customs union rules despite not being a formal member of either. Which might very well constrain Britain's ability to sign free trade deals with other countries outside the EU. The government will have to find a way through that if it is not to make Liam Fox's job as international trade secretary redundant. And in its deliberate ambiguity (every side needs to be able to claim victory) today's joint agreement leaves that debate for another day. The EU has said it wants to move urgently onto discussing and agreeing transition arrangements to be applied once Britain has officially left the union in March 2019. That now looks like being Phase II of this process. And from there, onto mapping out an agreement on free trade which will be put in place after the transition period has expired. That's Phase III. That has been seen as good news by businesses which need clarity on the trade rules they will be required to play by. And the more ""frictionless"" that trade is, many believe, the better for the economy. What today's deal has revealed is that there is a genuine desire - it appears from both sides - to get that free trade deal nailed down. ""One should be able to see that things are hopeless and yet be determined to make them otherwise,"" Fitzgerald wrote. Today, the UK and the EU have moved the process of Brexit significantly forward. Even if the end point is still shrouded in much uncertainty.

Reality Check: Where next for talks?What does deal mean for NI?,"If nothing is agreed until everything is agreed, then it is safe to say there is a long way to go. Phase one of the Brexit negotiations may be coming to an end, but phase two promises to be even more difficult. ""I very much welcome the prospect of moving ahead to the next phase,"" Theresa May said on Friday, ""to talk about trade and security and to discuss the positive and ambitious future relationship that is in all our interests."" Trade talks, I hear you cry? Not quite yet. For starters, negotiations on the divorce issues that we have learnt so much about have yet to be finalised. There are plenty of technical details that still need to be clarified, in parallel with any discussions about the future. Reality Check: Theresa May's deal with Brussels Listen: Brexitcast - there's a deal! Full text of the EU-UK statement,external In any case, the immediate priority will be to try to reach agreement on a transition period - for about two years after Brexit - in order to offer business a little more certainty, and everyone else a little more time. But there appear to be conflicting ideas about how any transition would work in practice. The Prime Minister has already accepted that existing EU rules and regulations would continue to apply. But she has also insisted that the UK will leave the single market and the customs union before a transition begins, on the day Brexit actually happens. The European Council's draft negotiating guidelines, due to be approved next week, see things rather differently. ""As you know,"" European Council President Donald Tusk said on Friday, ""the UK has asked for a transition of about two years, while remaining part of the single market and customs union."" Mr Tusk also emphasised that applying existing rules and regulations during a transition would not only mean the UK respecting the whole of EU law; the UK would also, he said, have to accept new laws without having any say in implementing them. In a further sign of trouble ahead, the European Council expects that the UK would continue to respect the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice during a transition, without having a British judge sitting on the court. None of this will, to put it mildly, go down well with Brexiteers at Westminster. And while this week has shown that compromise can be found, even in the most difficult of circumstances, there are some issues which cannot be solved by kicking the can down the road. Another big challenge during a transition period will be the fate of hundreds of agreements with third countries that apply to the UK at the moment precisely because it is a member of the European Union. These include free trade deals as well as numerous agreements on all types of regulatory co-operation. When the UK leaves the EU it will no longer be a legal part of any of these agreements - there is no way to roll them over automatically, and time to modify any of them to include the UK is already running extremely short. That's more than enough to be sorted out before we even start thinking about the outlines of a future relationship with the EU - on trade, security, foreign policy and other issues. The UK government wants to move on to start talking about trade Additional EU guidelines on the future relationship won't be published until next year anyway, and that means formal discussion of these issues may not begin for several months. Even then, the EU will not see them as proper trade talks. Internal EU documents talk of ""preliminary and preparatory discussions with the UK on a framework for the future relationship"" with the aim of agreeing a political declaration between the two sides by October 2018. A broad political discussion of that kind is a world away from a legal process leading to agreement on a new treaty. In the EU's legalistic world view, formal talks can only begin after Brexit, when the UK itself becomes a third country. ""Political agreements, with highfalutin aspirational guff, are one thing,"" said the former UK Permanent Representative to the EU, Ivan Rogers, in a recent lecture. ""Legally binding agreements, treaty changes and trade deal texts are another."" The UK government will hope to make progress more quickly, but it has yet to decide itself what kind of Brexit, and what kind of future relationship, it really wants. The cabinet is split between those who want to stay as close as possible to the EU's single market and all the regulations that implies, and those who argue that moving away from EU rules, and giving the UK the ability to strike out on its own, was one of the main aims of Brexit. Until that internal discussion produces a little more clarity, the EU will continue to proceed with caution. This has been a good week for the Brexit negotiations, real progress has been made. But when it comes to complexity, you ain't seen nothing yet.

What does deal mean for NI?,"An agreement on phase one of the Brexit negotiations between the EU and UK was reached on Friday The UK government's guarantees on the Irish border seem to sharply limit the variety of Brexit that's now on offer. It has pledged that, even if there's no deal, the UK, as a whole, will fully align with the rules of single market and customs union which are necessary to support north-south cooperation. The debates on ""full alignment"" are already under way and there are also big differences of opinion on what rules actually support that cross-border cooperation. But, at a minimum, it would seem that the UK would have to continue to follow EU rules on trade in goods and agriculture. Reality check: How much trade is there between UK and Ireland Long read: The hardest border Former Brexit minister and Leave campaigner David Jones zoomed in on this possibility. He told the BBC Radio 4's World at One: ""What we have got is just a commitment to try to work towards agreed solutions and if there are no agreed solutions then the clause provides that the UK will maintain full alignment with the rules of the internal market which support north-south cooperation. ""The worry about that is, of course, that it could relate to very important areas such as, for example, agriculture which we would want to throw into the mix in negotiating a free trade agreement with a third country. ""And if this was to persist, it could severely handicap our ability to enter into those free trade agreements, so I think we do need to see that particular provision refined."" The EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, was somewhat ambiguous in his comment. ""It's a unique situation, therefore specific solutions are needed,"" he said. ""That's a very clear line. And the UK's line is very clear too. We shall work on solutions which will be relevant only to the island of Ireland and not other parts (of the United Kingdom)."" But if the fallback ""no deal"" position is UK-wide alignment, then doesn't it mean that the preferred option of a deep and special partnership would be something close to the Swiss or Norway option? That sort of deal is not currently compatible with the UK's red lines. The EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier says that the present UK position would mean a trade deal would have to be along the lines as the one the EU has with Canada. There is going to be a lot of hard negotiating to come and compromises to be made. There is another interpretation of the deal that it still leaves the door open for a special status for Northern Ireland. TUV leader Jim Allister notes that the pledge of ""unfettered access"" for NI business to the whole of the UK internal market is not reciprocated with a promise of equal, unfettered access from GB to NI. Friday's Brexit deal allows talks to move to second stage. Could that mean that Northern Ireland would have some sort of different relationship with the single market while having preferential access to the GB market? The DUP leadership would say no, pointing to the assurances they have received from the prime minister. Sir Nick Macpherson, the former permanent secretary to the Treasury, gave a neat summary of the deal in a tweet this morning. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Court backs Making a Murderer confession,"A court has ruled that Brendan Dassey's murder confession was voluntary A US appeals court has upheld the conviction of Brendan Dassey, whose case was the focus of the Netflix documentary Making a Murderer. Dassey and his uncle Steven Avery were convicted of murdering a young woman, Teresa Halbach, in 2005. Last year, Dassey's conviction was overturned on the basis that his confession was coerced. But the state asked for a review and, on Friday, judges voted 4-3 that Dassey's confession was voluntary. The split decision from the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, which is based in Chicago, is a big blow for the 27-year-old's hopes of being freed. Making a Murderer lawyer says fame is 'bewildering' One of the judges, who voted that Dassey's confession was not voluntary, told the Chicago-Sun Times:""His confession was not voluntary and his conviction should not stand. I view this as a profound miscarriage of justice."",external His confession, made when he was 16, was a key factor in his conviction. He admitted helping his uncle Avery - who had already served 18 years for a crime he did not commit - rape, kill and mutilate Ms Halbach. Dassey said he and his uncle Steven Avery (pictured) killed a photographer in 2005 He was sentenced to life in prison, but the documentary filmmakers cast doubt on the legal process used to convict him. In 2016, Judge William Duffin ordered he be freed immediately after finding that investigators in the 2007 trial made ""repeated false promises"" to Dassey by assuring him ""he had nothing to worry about"". When considered with ""Dassey's age, intellectual deficits, and the absence of a supportive adult"", he considered the confession coerced. But the decision in Chicago on Friday has overturned Judge Duffin's ruling. Dassey will now remain in prison pending any further appeals. This video can not be played Making a Murderer's Moira Demos and Laura Ricciardi hit back at critics His case received wide attention after the release of the 10-part documentary Making a Murderer in December 2015.

Stormzy is BBC Music's artist of the year,"Stormzy made the transition from underground success to household name in 2017 Stormzy has been named artist of the year at the 2017 BBC Music Awards, capping a hugely successful year. The south London MC, whose debut album Gang Signs & Prayer was the first grime record to reach number one, beat Ed Sheeran and Lorde to the prize. He adds it to a collection that already includes three Mobos and the Q Award for best solo artist. Rag N Bone Man collected album of the year, while Foo Fighters won best live performance for their Glastonbury set. This video can not be played Highlights of Foo Fighters' set at Glastonbury 2017 The US band headlined the festival this June, two years after they were forced to pull out when frontman Dave Grohl broke his leg. Taking to the stage this summer, Grohl blamed the delay on ""bad traffic"", before launching into a blistering, hit-filled set. Their performance eventually overran by 20 minutes because the crowd kept singing between songs.

The south London MC, whose debut album Gang Signs & Prayer was the first grime record to reach number one, beat Ed Sheeran and Lorde to the prize. He adds it to a collection that already includes three Mobos and the Q Award for best solo artist. Rag N Bone Man collected album of the year, while Foo Fighters won best live performance for their Glastonbury set. This video can not be played Highlights of Foo Fighters' set at Glastonbury 2017 The US band headlined the festival this June, two years after they were forced to pull out when frontman Dave Grohl broke his leg. Taking to the stage this summer, Grohl blamed the delay on ""bad traffic"", before launching into a blistering, hit-filled set. Their performance eventually overran by 20 minutes because the crowd kept singing between songs.

""That's what you want every show to be, but when it's on that scale it's a big feeling."" This year's BBC Music Award winners pose with their trophies Rag N Bone Man's prize came in recognition of his debut album Human, which is the year's biggest-selling debut. ""That's a proper good award,"" he said. ""I keep thinking at one point that someone is going to fishhook me off and tell me it's a joke, but it's not, and it's a wonderful thing to have."" In previous years, the BBC Music Awards have been handed out at a glitzy televised arena concert, with performances from the likes of One Direction, Little Mix and Robbie Williams.

France bids farewell to rocker HallydayHundreds of thousands of fans are expected to line the streets of Paris to pay tribute to the star.25m26 minutes agoEurope,"This video can not be played Fans lined the streets to bid farewell to the 'French Elvis' Hundreds of thousands of people lined the streets of Paris on Saturday to bid farewell to the French rock star Johnny Hallyday, who died this week at the age of 74 after a battle with lung cancer. His coffin was driven in a cortege down the Champs-Elysees followed by hundreds of leather-clad bikers. President Emmanuel Macron paid tribute to the singer in a eulogy at the Madeleine church. Paris was brought to a standstill by the ceremony, which was broadcast live. As the cortege carrying his coffin left the funeral home in the Paris suburb of Nanterre, some 700 bikers took to the Champs-Elysees. People gathered on Place de la Concorde to pay a ""popular tribute"" to Hallyday Fans ride their bikes down the Champs-Elysees as part of the tribute Large crowds gathered to pay their respects outside the Madeleine church in Paris Hallyday's white coffin was driven slowly from the Arc de Triomphe along the famous avenue as emotional fans cheered and wept. During the service, members of his band performed instrumental versions of his songs outside at the Madeleine church as the crowds sang along. Members of Hallyday's band and other musicians performed as part of the ceremony Hallyday's white coffin leaves the church with a picture of the singer on display at the entrance Fans began to gather in the city overnight in anticipation of the country's ""national homage"" to the singer as giant screens were erected to show footage of the man known as the ""French Elvis"". National television and radio have put out a stream of special programmes since his death on Wednesday, with Hallyday's best-known songs being played along with recordings of tributes from friends and fans. Watch: An introduction to Hallyday Johnny Hallyday: Life in pictures The story of a French rock phenomenon How France saw itself in Johnny Hallyday Mr Macron approved Saturday's ceremony along with Hallyday's widow Laeticia amid a popular clamour for a national homage. The French president said the singer had touched everyone's lives: ""In each of your lives there have been moments where one of his songs translated what you had in your heart, what we have in our hearts. ""A love story, a loss, a moment of defiance, the birth of a child, pain - in his voice, in his songs, in his face."" As Mr Macron addressed the large crowd gathered at the church, many of whom were in tears, they chanted: ""Johnny, Johnny, Johnny Hallyday."" Many of those gathered outside the church became emotional during the tributes Fans had earlier gathered outside the star's home in Marnes-la-Coquette, west of Paris Some of the musician's fans have demanded that a monument be built in recognition of his achievements. Others have expressed disappointment at news that Hallyday is likely to be buried on the French Caribbean island of St Barts, where he had his home. One fan, Francois Le Lay, told AFP news agency: ""We would have preferred if he was buried in Paris, but if Johnny wanted that, we will respect it. ""My wife and I will put the money aside that we would have spent going to  his concerts so we can fly to Saint Barts one day."" On Friday, the Eiffel Tower was lit up with the words ""Merci Johnny"". At the famous L'Olympia music venue in Paris where Hallyday once enjoyed a three-week residency to mark 40 years in show business, the singer's name was displayed as a tribute. The Eiffel Tower displays the message ""Merci Johnny"" (Thank you Johnny) L'Olympia, one of Paris's oldest surviving music halls, pays tribute The star, whose real name was Jean-Philippe Smet, sold more than 110 million records and starred in a number of films, including one directed by Jean-Luc Godard. He once performed before a million people in a mobile musical cavalcade down the Champs-Elysees. However despite 6,000 fans chartering flights from Paris to see him play Las Vegas in 1996, he failed to crack the American or any other English-speaking market. The singer, who was once condemned as the rock 'n' roll ""corrupter of youth"", was often referred to as ""the French Elvis"" by critics.

"Heads urged to support LGBT staffHeads urged to offer more support to LGBT teachers to be their ""authentic selves"".7h7 hours agoFamily & Education","Grahame Colclough: ""Nothing was whispered, rushed, or secretive"" When senior staff member Grahame Colclough and his partner Jon decided to get married, his head teacher made the announcement in a school assembly. She presented gifts to the couple who had ""been together for years"". ""Nothing was whispered, rushed or secretive,"" Grahame remembers. Now, guidance from the heads' union NAHT urges all schools to be similarly supportive of lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans staff who want to reveal their sexual identities in classrooms. Billed as the first of its kind in the UK and endorsed by the campaign group Stonewall, the guidance covers key issues faced by LGBT staff - such as harassment, discrimination, bullying and lack of visibility. It also lays out the role and responsibilities of school leaders in creating workplaces where ""staff can feel safe and be open with colleagues and with pupils"". The NAHT says 2014 research from Manchester Business School found that individuals from sexual minority groups were more than twice as likely as heterosexuals to be bullied or discriminated against in the workplace, with knock-on effects on their physical and mental health. It also notes that a 2016 review for the government's Equalities Office found very high levels of workplace bullying and harassment against trans people. The guidance advises heads to take personal responsibility for promoting inclusion and tackling bullying based on sexual orientation. It includes: zero tolerance of homophobic, biphobic and transphobic bullying and banter supporting staff to teach about LGBT issues modifying dress codes to avoid gender stereotypes sex and relationship education to include LGBT experiences not allowing complaints or fear of complaints to hamper moves towards an inclusive school environment ""We haven't made as much progress as we should on LGBT-plus rights in schools. ""We need to change that,"" said NAHT general secretary Paul Whiteman. ""Schools decide the kind of society that we have, they transform children into citizens of the world and if we aren't getting the treatment of LGBT-plus pupils and teachers right in schools then we won't be getting it right in society. ""It shouldn't take bravery to be yourself or to stand up for your colleagues' rights, but it does sometimes. ""This can have a serious impact on the mental health, happiness and motivation of school staff as well as pupils."" The union's equalities group chairwoman, Sally Bates, said that while some LGBT-plus staff chose not to be open about their sexual orientation, too many others kept quiet for fear of discrimination, bullying or harassment. Nick Ward, director of Teach First, said he wanted a world where teachers are ""not just permitted but supported and encouraged to discuss their sexual and gender identity in order to provide what all teachers aim to provide, a role model for their students"". Troy Jenkinson, a Leicestershire primary head teacher who is open about his sexuality, said: ""It is crucial for us to get it right now in our schools so we can prepare our students for accepting diversity as they become the next generation of adults. ""In the words of one of my Year 6 pupils, 'Love is love.'"" The NAHT wants all schools to behave like Grahame Colclough's where he says the wedding announcement was ""perfectly normal and exactly how it happens for all of the staff in our school who are getting married"".

US lawmaker quits over 'surrogacy' remarksRepublican Trent Franks is the third lawmaker to resign in three days over sexual harassment claims.9h9 hours agoUS & Canada,"Trent Franks is accused of offering a former aide $5m to act as a surrogate mother Arizona Republican Trent Franks has resigned amid an ethics investigation into claims he repeatedly asked female staff to be surrogate mothers. The announcement came after a congressional panel said it was opening an inquiry into sexual harassment allegations against Mr Franks. The lawmaker acknowledged discussing surrogacy with two female aides when he and his wife were facing infertility. He is the third member of Congress to resign in three days. The Associated Press reports,externalone of Mr Franks' former aides accuses him of offering her $5m (Â£3.7m) to act as a surrogate mother, repeatedly pressing her to carry his child. She told the news agency that another female staff member had also been approached by Mr Franks about surrogacy. One of the aides reportedly said Mr Franks retaliated against her after she turned down his alleged surrogacy requests by ignoring her and withholding assignments. A spokesman for the eight-term congressman - who has a net worth of $33m - would not comment on whether he had offered aides money to act as surrogates. Mr Franks said on Thursday his resignation would take effect next month. But on Friday he said he had decided to quit immediately after his wife was admitted to a Washington hospital ""due to an ongoing ailment"". In a statement,externalon Thursday, the 60-year-old Republican acknowledged ""my discussion of surrogacy with two previous female subordinates, making each feel uncomfortable. ""I deeply regret that my discussion of this option and process in the workplace caused distress."" Senator Franken to quit amid grope claims US lawmaker to retire amid harassment claims Mr Franks said he and his wife, Josephine, had used a surrogate to carry their two twins. He stood down as the House of Representatives ethics committee opened an inquiry against him into a matter that ""constitutes sexual harassment and/or retaliation for opposing sexual harassment"". Republican Speaker of the House Paul Ryan said he had advised the congressman to stand down. Why so many sexual harassment cases in US, not UK? US House requires anti-harassment training Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington In the space of one week, three members of Congress have announced they are resigning because of sexual misconduct allegations. That, in all likelihood, is just the beginning. If the past is any guide, the worst transgressions and abuses of power come in institutions - Hollywood, the Catholic Church, the athletic department of a major state university - where authority is unchecked and accountability is limited. The halls of Congress all too often fit that description. Each congressional office is like a mini kingdom, with the member of Congress as monarch. Employees work at the ""will and pleasure"" of the elected politician. Staffers share stories of abuse - sometimes of the walk-my-dog, pick-up-my-dry-cleaning variety and sometimes much darker. Those darker stories are beginning to come to light. Journalists are digging, and there are already reports of dozens of legislators under the microscope. Both parties are being tested. If politicians in Washington aren't sweating, they should be. The real test, however, will come when voters head to the polls in the months ahead. Will they hold lawmakers accountable? The answer will go a long way to determining whether the #MeToo movement is a blip or if it will fundamentally reshape the Washington power structure. The ethics committee also announced on Thursday it was investigating Texas Republican Blake Farenthold amid claims of sexual misconduct against him by a former member of staff. Lawmaker 'used tax funds to settle lawsuit' It was revealed last week that Mr Farenthold used $84,000 of taxpayer money to settle a sexual harassment lawsuit with his former communications director. Resignations of two Democratic lawmakers have shaken Washington this week. Democratic congressman John Conyers announced on Tuesday that he will step down after multiple aides accused him of sexual misconduct. Hours before Mr Franks' announcement, Minnesota Democratic Senator Al Franken said he too was resigning over claims of groping after several Democrats called on him to step down.

'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks,"This video can not be played The prime minister said the deal will allow more to be invested in ""priorities at home"" PM Theresa May has struck a last-minute deal with the EU in a bid to move Brexit talks on to the next phase. There will be no ""hard border"" with Ireland; and the rights of EU citizens in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be protected. The so-called ""divorce bill"" will amount to between Â£35bn and Â£39bn, Downing Street sources say. The European Commission president said it was a ""breakthrough"" and he was confident EU leaders will approve it. Brexit deal as it happened Full text of the EU-UK statement,external Kuenssberg: Theresa May buys breathing space So, did 'soft Brexit' just win? Brexitcast - EU deal special Reality Check: What next for talks? They are due to meet next Thursday for a European Council summit and need to give their backing to the deal if the next phase of negotiations are to begin. Talks can then move onto a transition deal to cover a period of up to two years after Brexit, and the ""framework for the future relationship"" - preliminary discussions about a future trade deal, although the EU says a deal can only be finalised once the UK has left the EU. A final withdrawal treaty and transition deal will have to be ratified by the EU nations and the UK Parliament, before the UK leaves in March 2019. Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, whose opposition on Monday led to talks breaking down,  said there was still ""more work to be done"" on the border issue and how it votes on the final deal ""will depend on its contents"". Mrs May depends on the party's support to win key votes in Westminster. The pound was trading at a six-month high against the euro as news broke of the draft agreement. Guarantee that there will be""no hard border"" between Northern Ireland and the Republicand that the ""constitutional and economic integrity of the United Kingdom"" will be maintained. EU citizens living in the UK and vice versawill have their rights to live, work and study protected.  The agreement includes reunification rights for relatives who do not live in the UK to join them in their host country in the future Financial settlement- No specific figure is in the document but Downing Street sources say it will be between Â£35bn and Â£39bn, including budget contributions during a two-year ""transition"" period after March 2019 Brexit: All you need to know The UK government and the EU want to maintain the free flow of goods, without border checks that they fear could threaten a return to The Troubles, but the DUP does not want Northern Ireland to be treated differently to the rest of the UK after Brexit. The joint EU-UK document says any future deal must protect ""North-South co-operation"" and hold to the UK's ""guarantee of avoiding a hard border"". The agreement also says ""no new regulatory barriers"" will be allowed between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, and that Northern Ireland's businesses will continue to have ""unfettered access"" to the UK internal market - a passage thought to have been added to meet DUP concerns. But it also sets out a fallback position if the UK fails to agree a trade deal. This could prove controversial because it says there will continue to be ""full alignment"" between the EU and Northern Ireland on some elements of cross-border trade, as set out in the Good Friday Agreement. The DUP would have preferred this not to be in the agreement, says the BBC's Chris Morris, and there could be some hard negotiating to do further down the line. 'More Brexit work to be done' warns Foster What does Brexit deal mean for NI? Watching the Brexit deal unfold in Brussels Agreement has been reached on what happens to the three million EU citizens living in the UK and more than a million UK citizens in EU states after Brexit. EU citizens currently in the UK would be allowed to continue living and working there - and those already in the country who do not yet have permanent residency would be able to acquire it after Brexit. Freedom of movement could continue for two years after March 2019, although the UK says new arrivals will have to register. The plan is that UK citizens in living in an EU country would get the same rights, although they would not retain them if they moved to another EU country. For eight years after Brexit, UK courts will be able to refer cases involving EU nationals to the European Court of Justice for interpretation. But the campaign group the 3million, which represents EU citizens in the UK, said there was ""still no clarity around the registration criteria for these rights"" and said of the eight years: ""Our rights should not have an expiry date"". Brexit: What now for EU citizens in the UK? A figure is not mentioned in the text of the agreement but Downing Street sources says it will be between Â£35bn and Â£39bn.  It will be paid over four years and the precise figure is unlikely to be known for some time. EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said the EU had agreed to drop the cost of relocating UK-based EU agencies from the final divorce bill. The prime minister said it would be ""fair to the British taxpayer"" and would mean the UK in future ""will be able to invest more in our priorities at home, such as housing, schools and the NHS"". Technically a future trade deal cannot be signed while the UK remains a member of the EU but ""preliminary and preparatory discussions"" can begin. But the EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier has said the withdrawal treaty and transition deal need to be ready by October 2018 - in order that they can be ratified by March 2019, before the ""real negotiation"" begins on the future relationship. Mr Barnier suggested on Friday that the only option for a future trade arrangement wasa Canada-style deal, rather than a one based on Norway, which retains free movement and unrestricted access to the single market but pays into the EU budget. The European Council wants the UK to remain a ""member"" of the EU's customs union and single market and to remain under the full jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice during the transition period, according to a leaked document. This video can not be played DUP leader Arlene Foster welcomes ""no red line down the Irish Sea"" The DUP, whose opposition on Monday led to talks breaking down, say there have been six ""substantial changes"" to the text. Party leader Arlene Foster said they would mean there was ""no red line down the Irish Sea"" - meaning no customs barrier between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. But BBC Northern Ireland economics editor John Campbell says there is a lot of hard negotiating to come and compromises to be made. Another interpretation of the deal is that that it still leaves the door open for a special status for Northern Ireland, he adds. What does Brexit deal mean for NI?

"Analysis: May buys breathing spaceSo, did 'soft Brexit' just win?Reality Check: Where next for talks?What does deal mean for NI?Watching the Brexit talks unfold in Brussels","The prime minister made her decisions on Thursday night while the No 10 Downing Street Christmas party carried on. It isn't celebration on Friday though for her government, but relief. And her allies note that in those fraught hours she made thedecision to go to Brusselseven though the DUP had continued to make its objections known, despite the progress it had secured. That may be a comfort to her internal critics who believe that Theresa May is all too often a prisoner of circumstance rather than a bold decision maker. And after a rocky few months, Downing Street can breathe out, for once, because it reached a critical short-term goal, moving on from Monday's embarrassment to a temporary conclusion. And it matters so much. Brexit is the biggest political and policy project any British government has undertaken for many, many years. As the leader of the government pursuing the policy, the prime minister's own record rises and falls with the progress of our departure from the EU. Simply, while No 10 always maintains that she wants to focus on domestic reforms, Mrs May's fate is intertwined with these negotiations. The deal was sealed at an early hours breakfast meeting on Friday The talks stumble, and so does she. The negotiators muddle through, so does her leadership. And the deal at dawn mutes the criticism of her inside her party, and restores some of the faith perhaps in Brussels. Had it not been struck, had she not made the decision to get on the plane, there would have been serious rumblings in her party. It might not have been the end of her leadership. There are plenty of hopeful leadership contenders, but few who would be guaranteed to put their head above the parapet to try to push her out. But critical Brexiteers have been conspicuous by their absence. And Remainers are relieved that she has, as they see it, been firm in the face of some of their and the DUP's demands, and left the route pointing to asofter Brexit. In truth, so much has not been agreed. This is a document that to a large extent, resolves to solve problems and contradictions together in the future. The document contains more ambiguities than pages. And as with any compromises there are some losses, and some victories. Over time those fault lines will appear. The two sides of the Tories' internal debates over Europe have not suddenly met in the middle. The brooding clash has been delayed, again, allowing the prime minister to press on into the next phase. And above all, the agreements in this document may never come to pass. Truly, ""nothing is agreed until everything is agreed"". This is a big, first, political step that allows the real journey to begin. With this progress, however limited, Theresa May buys breathing space.

"So, did 'soft Brexit' just win?Reality Check: Where next for talks?What does deal mean for NI?Watching the Brexit talks unfold in Brussels","The agreement commits both sides to an open border between Northern Ireland and the Republic ""The test of a first-rate intelligence,"" F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote in The Crack-Up, ""is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time, and still retain the ability to function."" Today the British government and the European Union are making a fist of passing that test. Reading the joint report between the UK and the EU, it is clear that the most important section when considering the economics of Brexit is the section on Ireland. The document commits both sides to an open border between Northern Ireland and the Republic, and that there will be ""no new regulatory barriers"" between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. It also commits to the UK leaving the EU's single market and customs union. These two positions appear to be in contradiction. If Britain does become a ""third country"" - that is trading with the EU as other non-EU countries outside the single market and the customs union do - then border controls will be necessary. And that open border will become very much more closed. Full text of the EU-UK statement,external Business calls for more clarity Reality Check: What key lines really mean Brexit: All you need to know There is at least a partial way around this conundrum. And it necessitates the comprehensive free trade deal the British government has said it wants. And at least closely mirroring customs arrangements we presently adhere to as members of the EU's customs union. That equates for many with a ""soft Brexit"" and is the trajectory many economists argue would be best for the UK economy. This is because, if there is no free trade agreement, it is difficult to see how Theresa May's government could maintain ""full alignment with the rules of the internal market and the customs union which support north-south co-operation [on the island of Ireland]"" which the joint report commits the PM to. And still say that Britain has left the EU. This document has been described as the ""withdrawal deal"". But it is actually far more importantly a signal of what the future might hold. And that appears to be a relationship where the UK closely follows the EU's single market and customs union rules despite not being a formal member of either. Which might very well constrain Britain's ability to sign free trade deals with other countries outside the EU. The government will have to find a way through that if it is not to make Liam Fox's job as international trade secretary redundant. And in its deliberate ambiguity (every side needs to be able to claim victory) today's joint agreement leaves that debate for another day. The EU has said it wants to move urgently onto discussing and agreeing transition arrangements to be applied once Britain has officially left the union in March 2019. That now looks like being Phase II of this process. And from there, onto mapping out an agreement on free trade which will be put in place after the transition period has expired. That's Phase III. That has been seen as good news by businesses which need clarity on the trade rules they will be required to play by. And the more ""frictionless"" that trade is, many believe, the better for the economy. What today's deal has revealed is that there is a genuine desire - it appears from both sides - to get that free trade deal nailed down. ""One should be able to see that things are hopeless and yet be determined to make them otherwise,"" Fitzgerald wrote. Today, the UK and the EU have moved the process of Brexit significantly forward. Even if the end point is still shrouded in much uncertainty.

Reality Check: Where next for talks?What does deal mean for NI?Watching the Brexit talks unfold in Brussels,"If nothing is agreed until everything is agreed, then it is safe to say there is a long way to go. Phase one of the Brexit negotiations may be coming to an end, but phase two promises to be even more difficult. ""I very much welcome the prospect of moving ahead to the next phase,"" Theresa May said on Friday, ""to talk about trade and security and to discuss the positive and ambitious future relationship that is in all our interests."" Trade talks, I hear you cry? Not quite yet. For starters, negotiations on the divorce issues that we have learnt so much about have yet to be finalised. There are plenty of technical details that still need to be clarified, in parallel with any discussions about the future. Reality Check: Theresa May's deal with Brussels Listen: Brexitcast - there's a deal! Full text of the EU-UK statement,external In any case, the immediate priority will be to try to reach agreement on a transition period - for about two years after Brexit - in order to offer business a little more certainty, and everyone else a little more time. But there appear to be conflicting ideas about how any transition would work in practice. The Prime Minister has already accepted that existing EU rules and regulations would continue to apply. But she has also insisted that the UK will leave the single market and the customs union before a transition begins, on the day Brexit actually happens. The European Council's draft negotiating guidelines, due to be approved next week, see things rather differently. ""As you know,"" European Council President Donald Tusk said on Friday, ""the UK has asked for a transition of about two years, while remaining part of the single market and customs union."" Mr Tusk also emphasised that applying existing rules and regulations during a transition would not only mean the UK respecting the whole of EU law; the UK would also, he said, have to accept new laws without having any say in implementing them. In a further sign of trouble ahead, the European Council expects that the UK would continue to respect the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice during a transition, without having a British judge sitting on the court. None of this will, to put it mildly, go down well with Brexiteers at Westminster. And while this week has shown that compromise can be found, even in the most difficult of circumstances, there are some issues which cannot be solved by kicking the can down the road. Another big challenge during a transition period will be the fate of hundreds of agreements with third countries that apply to the UK at the moment precisely because it is a member of the European Union. These include free trade deals as well as numerous agreements on all types of regulatory co-operation. When the UK leaves the EU it will no longer be a legal part of any of these agreements - there is no way to roll them over automatically, and time to modify any of them to include the UK is already running extremely short. That's more than enough to be sorted out before we even start thinking about the outlines of a future relationship with the EU - on trade, security, foreign policy and other issues. The UK government wants to move on to start talking about trade Additional EU guidelines on the future relationship won't be published until next year anyway, and that means formal discussion of these issues may not begin for several months. Even then, the EU will not see them as proper trade talks. Internal EU documents talk of ""preliminary and preparatory discussions with the UK on a framework for the future relationship"" with the aim of agreeing a political declaration between the two sides by October 2018. A broad political discussion of that kind is a world away from a legal process leading to agreement on a new treaty. In the EU's legalistic world view, formal talks can only begin after Brexit, when the UK itself becomes a third country. ""Political agreements, with highfalutin aspirational guff, are one thing,"" said the former UK Permanent Representative to the EU, Ivan Rogers, in a recent lecture. ""Legally binding agreements, treaty changes and trade deal texts are another."" The UK government will hope to make progress more quickly, but it has yet to decide itself what kind of Brexit, and what kind of future relationship, it really wants. The cabinet is split between those who want to stay as close as possible to the EU's single market and all the regulations that implies, and those who argue that moving away from EU rules, and giving the UK the ability to strike out on its own, was one of the main aims of Brexit. Until that internal discussion produces a little more clarity, the EU will continue to proceed with caution. This has been a good week for the Brexit negotiations, real progress has been made. But when it comes to complexity, you ain't seen nothing yet.

What does deal mean for NI?Watching the Brexit talks unfold in Brussels,"An agreement on phase one of the Brexit negotiations between the EU and UK was reached on Friday The UK government's guarantees on the Irish border seem to sharply limit the variety of Brexit that's now on offer. It has pledged that, even if there's no deal, the UK, as a whole, will fully align with the rules of single market and customs union which are necessary to support north-south cooperation. The debates on ""full alignment"" are already under way and there are also big differences of opinion on what rules actually support that cross-border cooperation. But, at a minimum, it would seem that the UK would have to continue to follow EU rules on trade in goods and agriculture. Reality check: How much trade is there between UK and Ireland Long read: The hardest border Former Brexit minister and Leave campaigner David Jones zoomed in on this possibility. He told the BBC Radio 4's World at One: ""What we have got is just a commitment to try to work towards agreed solutions and if there are no agreed solutions then the clause provides that the UK will maintain full alignment with the rules of the internal market which support north-south cooperation. ""The worry about that is, of course, that it could relate to very important areas such as, for example, agriculture which we would want to throw into the mix in negotiating a free trade agreement with a third country. ""And if this was to persist, it could severely handicap our ability to enter into those free trade agreements, so I think we do need to see that particular provision refined."" The EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, was somewhat ambiguous in his comment. ""It's a unique situation, therefore specific solutions are needed,"" he said. ""That's a very clear line. And the UK's line is very clear too. We shall work on solutions which will be relevant only to the island of Ireland and not other parts (of the United Kingdom)."" But if the fallback ""no deal"" position is UK-wide alignment, then doesn't it mean that the preferred option of a deep and special partnership would be something close to the Swiss or Norway option? That sort of deal is not currently compatible with the UK's red lines. The EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier says that the present UK position would mean a trade deal would have to be along the lines as the one the EU has with Canada. There is going to be a lot of hard negotiating to come and compromises to be made. There is another interpretation of the deal that it still leaves the door open for a special status for Northern Ireland. TUV leader Jim Allister notes that the pledge of ""unfettered access"" for NI business to the whole of the UK internal market is not reciprocated with a promise of equal, unfettered access from GB to NI. Friday's Brexit deal allows talks to move to second stage. Could that mean that Northern Ireland would have some sort of different relationship with the single market while having preferential access to the GB market? The DUP leadership would say no, pointing to the assurances they have received from the prime minister. Sir Nick Macpherson, the former permanent secretary to the Treasury, gave a neat summary of the deal in a tweet this morning. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Watching the Brexit talks unfold in Brussels,"This video can not be played The prime minister said the deal will allow more to be invested in ""priorities at home"" I had been warned to keep my phone by the bed. It rang at 05:09 here in Brussels (04:09 GMT). ""The prime minister is in the air,"" said my government source. Theresa May's motorcade arrived at the HQ of the European Commission less than two hours later. There were hugs for all as she, her chief civil servant negotiator Olly Robbins and Brexit Secretary David Davis were met by European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and Michel Barnier, the EU's Mr Brexit. Pictures were released showing the two sides enjoying fruit juice and pastries. It was obvious a deal was being done. Why put everyone through this otherwise? Aides filed into the briefing room ahead of the big news conference. They wore the opposite expressions they had had on Monday when hopes of a deal evaporated under pressure from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party. The two sides of Brexit shared juice and pastries in Brussels on Friday morning Mr Juncker sketched out the agreement that had been reached: financial obligations had been clarified, the European Court of Justice would remain ""competent"" to guarantee the rights of EU nationals in the UK, and a hard border would be avoided on the island of Ireland. It was a personal triumph for the prime minister, he said. I asked the prime minister what compromises had been made to get here. She said it had been about both sides working together. Diplomats said the display of mutual respect demonstrated that the next phase of talks will be less bad-tempered, less fraught and more collegiate now that divorce-related issues have been broadly settled. Issue that nearly scuppered border talks European press relieved at Brexit 'white smoke' Deal: Mrs May is welcomed by Mr Juncker in Brussels Later we heard from Michel Barnier. At length. His pride in the deal he had negotiated was evident as he explained it in painstaking detail. He gently chided journalists who had failed to grasp the complexities of the compromise on Ireland. He reminded everyone that he had never speculated about the size of the UK's financial obligations (Â£35bn-Â£39bn, according to British estimates). Mr Barnier complained that I always posed the same question about whether he was prepared to make any concessions. Afterwards I asked if he would be cracking open a bottle of champagne. ""No,"" he replied. ""You have to drink water when you are negotiating and there's still a lot of work to do."" Brexit: All you need to know This video can not be played ""No champagne"" for the Brexit negotiators, who ""have to drink water"" The scale of that work became clear as the action switched to the European Council, where the member states are represented. Donald Tusk, who will chair next week's summit of EU leaders, said this had been the easy part. Negotiating a transition deal and the outlines of a future partnership on trade, security and defence will be more difficult and had to be done within a year, he said. The EU desperately wants the UK to clarify what kind of post-Brexit relationship it wants.

Israel strikes Hamas sites across Gaza,"This video can not be played 'I didn't fall, they shot me' Israel says it has targeted sites in Gaza belonging to militant group Hamas in retaliation for rocket strikes. Israel's military said it had hit weapons sites early on Saturday. Two people died, a Gaza hospital said, bringing the deaths in Israeli strikes and gunfire over the past day to four. Three rockets were fired at Israel from Gaza late on Friday. Israeli-Palestinian tensions have risen since President Donald Trump recognised Jerusalem as Israel's capital. Wednesday's decision reversed decades of US neutrality on one of the most sensitive issues between the two sides. Israel has always regarded Jerusalem as its capital, while the Palestinians claim East Jerusalem - occupied by Israel in the 1967 war - as the capital of a future Palestinian state. The diplomatic fallout over Mr Trump's move has continued, with Palestinian officials saying that President Mahmoud Abbas will refuse to meet US Vice-President Mike Pence later this month. Egypt's Coptic Church has also cancelled a planned meeting, saying Mr Trump's declaration ""did not take into account the feelings of millions of Arab people"". At a security conference in Bahrain, the UAE's Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash said the Jerusalem announcement was ""a gift to radicalism"", Reuters news agency reports.

Two Palestinians were also killed in clashes with Israeli troops at the Gaza border At least 217 Palestinians were also wounded, Palestinian medics say Of the three rockets fired at Israel, Israel's military said it had intercepted one with its Iron Dome defence system, one was found on wasteland and another landed in Sderot late on Friday. No casualties were reported Earlier on Friday, Fathi Hammad, a senior Hamas leader, said anyone seeking to move their embassy to Jerusalem was ""an enemy of the Palestinians"". Speaking before the United Nations on Friday, US ambassador Nikki Haley said the US ""recognises the obvious; that Jerusalem is the capital of Israel"".

UN outrageously hostile to Israel - US,"This video can not be played People gathered in the Old City in Jerusalem The US envoy to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, has accused the UN of damaging the prospects for peace between Israel and the Palestinians. The organisation ""has outrageously been one of the world's foremost centres of hostility towards Israel"", she said. Mrs Haley was addressing an emergency meeting of the Security Council called after President Donald Trump's decision to move the US embassy to Jerusalem. The move has been widely condemned and sparked clashes in the West Bank. Israel has carried out air strikes against targets in the Gaza Strip, injuring a number of people, after Palestinian militants fired rockets into Israeli territory.

Archbishop criticises grammar schoolsJustin Welby calls on the government to have an inclusive approach to the future of education.1m2 minutes agoUK,"Justin Welby says governments should not look to the past to improve education The Archbishop of Canterbury has criticised grammar schools as ""contrary to the notion of the common good"". Speaking in the House of Lords, the Most Rev Justin Welby called for education to focus on ""drawing the best out of every person"", rather than a selective approach. He said governments should not look to the past and ""waste our time rummaging there for the solutions of tomorrow."" Some Tory MPs said grammar schools offer ""invaluable opportunities"". What now for grammar schools? First 'new' grammar school in 50 years Grammar schools: What are they? The archbishop led a debate on education, saying the country was now in a ""fourth digital revolution"" and schools had one of the ""greatest challenges"" in tackling the ""seismic shift"" when it comes to preparing children for the future. However, he said ""children of privilege continue to inherit privilege"" and the system was not acting in a way to help everyone. ""The academic selective approach to education, one which prioritises separation as a necessary precondition for the nurture of excellence, makes a statement about the purpose of education that is contrary to the notion of the common good,"" the archbishop said. ""An approach that neglects those of lesser ability or because of a misguided notion of levelling out does not give the fullest opportunity to those of highest ability or does not enable all to develop a sense of community and mutuality."" His comments have been denounced by some MPs who back the schools. Conservative Andrew Bridgentold the Daily Mail,external: ""[Mr Welby] is obviously entitled to his own views, but the evidence is that grammar schools are a great way for under-privileged children to escape poverty. ""It is well known that they provide social mobility for the under-privileged."" Fellow Conservative MP Conor Burns also told the newspaper: ""Many grammar school provide invaluable opportunities for children from both poor and rich backgrounds, and give them the opportunities they may not otherwise have."" In 2016, Theresa May outlined plans to introduce a ""new generation"" of grammar schools by 2020, removing the ban introduced by Labour in 1997. However, after the general election in June - and without a majority in Parliament -the government scrapped the plans, saying instead they would ""look at all options"" for opening new schools, without removing the ban.

Ex-Georgia leader detained in Ukraine,"Mikheil Saakashvili is suspected of receiving financing from a criminal group Former Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili has been detained in Ukraine's capital Kiev, days after his supporters freed him from a police van. Mr Saakashvili, who in 2015-16 served as regional governor in Ukraine under President Petro Poroshenko, has been leading anti-corruption rallies against his former ally. On Tuesday, he was dragged from his home in Kiev and arrested. He has been calling for Mr Poroshenko's impeachment since his first arrest. What next for the Saakashvili circus? The authorities responded by giving him a deadline of 24 hours to hand himself in. Mr Saakashvili is accused of receiving financing from a criminal group linked to ousted Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych. His detention was part of an operation ""to disrupt a plan of revenge of pro-Kremlin forces in Ukraine"", Ukraine's Prosecutor General Yuriy Lutsenko said on Tuesday. This video can not be played Jonah Fisher watched as Mr Saakashvili's car was surrounded by his supporters and Ukrainian police Prosecutors released audio and video recordings which they say proved he had received hundreds of thousands of dollars from the criminal group. Mr Saakashvili said the recordings were fake. If found guilty, he could face up to five years in jail. Mr Saakashvili also faces the threat of extradition to Georgia, where he is wanted on corruption charges. He says the accusations are politically motivated. He was governor of the southern Odessa region for 18 months after being appointed by Mr Poroshenko in 2015. Before moving to Ukraine, Mr Saakashvili served for almost 10 years as president of Georgia. Crowd frees ex-Georgia leader in Ukraine From Tbilisi to a tent: What next for the Saakashvili circus?

Iran to hear UK fears for jailed Briton,"Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe has been held in Iran since April 2016 Boris Johnson has held talks in Iran to press for the release of British-Iranian Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe. The UK foreign secretary met his Iranian counterpart Mohammad Javad Zarif to call for the release of the mother-of-one on humanitarian grounds, along with other dual nationals. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe has been held in Tehran since April 2016 after being accused of spying, which she denies. Mr Johnson's first visit to Iran comes amid rising tension in the Middle East. On Saturday afternoon he will meet the speaker of the Iranian parliament and the secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council. BBC diplomatic correspondent James Robbins said Mr Johnson is expected to emphasise Britain's continuing support for the international nuclear deal with Iran, but he will also make clear Britain's concerns about some of Iran's activities, notably in Yemen and Syria. Our correspondent said Mr Johnson's trip to Tehran - only the third made by a UK foreign secretary since 2003 - could ""hardly be more sensitive"". Mr Johnson did not speak to reporters before going into the meeting with Mohammad Javad Zarif He added that Mr Johnson had been careful to lower any expectations of imminent release for 37-year-old Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, warning that such cases are very difficult. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe: Caught in Iran power struggle The uncertain fate of Iran's jailed dual nationals Global powers defy US over Iran deal shift Mr Ratcliffe met with Mr Johnson to discuss his wife's case earlier this year Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was arrested during a holiday visit to enable her parents to meet her baby daughter Gabriella. After the arrest her daughter's passport was confiscated and for the last 20 months she has been living with her maternal grandparents in Iran. By Frank Gardner, BBC security correspondent in Bahrain Even before Boris Johnson took off for Tehran, the foreign office wisely lowered expectations of an immediate release of the imprisoned dual national Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe. The Iranians will have prepared very carefully for this visit, as they have concerns and demands of their own. In Iran there is a pervading sense that the West is not fully living up to its side of the bargain in the 2015 Vienna nuclear deal. Flows of money through London, for example, are still restricted and the hoped-for economic dividend has failed to materialise for many Iranians. Complicating matters for Boris Johnson is the fact that there are essentially 'two Irans'. There is the elected government, which he has been meeting today. Then there is the deep state: the Revolutionary Guards Corps, the judiciary and the intelligence and security apparatus, all of which are hostile to the West and likely to impose a hard line on any negotiations. Mr Johnson was accused of risking an additional five years being added to her sentence when he told a parliamentary committee that she had been in Iran to train journalists. In November,he apologised in the Commons, retracting ""any suggestion she was there in a professional capacity"". Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe with her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, and daughter, Gabriella Mr Johnson then met with her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, to discuss her case, including calls for her to be given diplomatic protection. Mr Ratcliffe told The Guardian,externalthat he was ""waiting on tenterhooks, biting my nails"", ahead of Mr Johnson's visit. There have beenconcerns about Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's healthafter lumps in her breasts were discovered, but those were found to be non-cancerous. Tulip Siddiq, Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's MP, said she had been told by the Foreign Office that Mr Johnson probably would not be able to secure her imminent release. ""It was made very clear that we shouldn't expect any miracles,"" the MP for Hampstead and Kilburn said. Although not mentioning her by name, Mr Johnson said: ""I will stress my grave concerns about our dual national consular cases and press for their release where there are humanitarian grounds to do so."" The Foreign Office would not confirm the names or number of other people being held in Iran, saying their families had asked for their cases to be kept out of the public domain. In addition, the BBC hasissued a statement on Twitter,external, urging Mr Johnson to raise the case of the BBC Persian staff during his visit. The BBC Persian Service has long been viewed with hostility by hardline Iranians. Two months ago, Iranian authorities launched an investigation into 152 present and former journalists and staff, accusing them of conspiracy against national security. The BBC News Press Team called upon Iran ""to stop the harassment and persecution of our staff and their families"".

He also said he would underline theUK's support for the 2015 nuclear deal- struck between Iran and six world powers - but ""make clear"" concerns over the country's activity. Mr Johnson added: ""Iran is a significant country in a strategically important, but volatile and unstable, region which matters to the UK's security and prosperity. ""While our relationship with Iran has improved significantly since 2011, it is not straightforward and on many issues we will not agree.

"Jail for cleaning fluid attack robbersThe pair used the ammonia to target ""petite women"" who would not be able to fight back.5h5 hours agoLondon","Sadik Kamara (left) and Joshua Jordan were part of a gang of five who targeted the women Two robbers who laughed after spraying women in their faces with cleaning fluid have been jailed for 10 years. Rapper Sadik Kamara, 24, known as Trizzy Trapz, and Joshua Jordan, 20, both of Newham, east London, used the ammonia to target ""petite women"" who would not be able to fight back. Judge John Dodd QC jailed them for the ""horrifying, cruel and barbaric"" crimes which he said were ""gratuitous"". Both women they attacked suffered facial burns but were not disfigured. Prosecutor Benn Maguire told the Old Bailey how the defendants were among a gang of five who set out to deliberately target ""petite women"" to rob on 10 March. ""During the robbery and undoubtedly to instil fear in the minds of their victims, the attackers sprayed ammonia into the faces of their victims,"" he said. ""Any attempt to shout for help has resulted in ammonia being sprayed into the open mouths of the female victims - cowardly in the extreme."" The pair were previously found guilty of using the corrosive fluid with intent to injure or cause grievous bodily harm. They were also convicted of robbery and attempted robbery. Jailing Kamara and Jordan for 10 years with four years on extended licence, the judge said: ""These are dreadful and shocking offences. You chose to rob women who would have stood no chance against you, a gang of five men. ""Even if you were unarmed, you still chose to take ammonia with you and use it against two slight women."" In one attack in Hackney, shopkeeper Quyen Bei, 51, fought off the raiders. Four men with faces covered were captured on CCTV as they entered the store wearing hoods and gloves. The pair were sentenced at the Old Bailey on Friday During the attempted robbery, Kamara squirted ammonia in Mrs Bei's face at least three times. The other robbers, including Jordan, struggled with Mrs Bei, who was punched to the ground and kicked. She managed to press the panic alarm despite suffering burns to her face. The gang fled empty-handed. About 10 minutes later, the defendants attacked a random woman in the street, the court heard. The pair forced Vietnamese Thi Le Nguyen, 49, to the ground and one pinned her face to the pavement while the other repeatedly sprayed her face with the cleaning fluid. They snatched her handbag and ran back to their getaway car laughing together. Bottles of household cleaner containing high-strength ammonia were found nearby, clearly marked with warnings it could cause ""severe skin burns and blindness"". Following sentencing, Det Con Ben Kahane said: ""The level of violence used was completely disproportionate. ""The witness testimony describing how two of the suspects ran off laughing I think sums up the callous enjoyment the gang felt in targeting their victims.""

"Heads urged to support LGBT staffHeads urged to offer more support to LGBT teachers to be their ""authentic selves"".2m2 minutes agoFamily & Education","Grahame Colclough: ""Nothing was whispered, rushed, or secretive"" When senior staff member Grahame Colclough and his partner Jon decided to get married, his head teacher made the announcement in a school assembly. She presented gifts to the couple who had ""been together for years"". ""Nothing was whispered, rushed or secretive,"" Grahame remembers. Now, guidance from the heads' union NAHT urges all schools to be similarly supportive of lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans staff who want to reveal their sexual identities in classrooms. Billed as the first of its kind in the UK and endorsed by the campaign group Stonewall, the guidance covers key issues faced by LGBT staff - such as harassment, discrimination, bullying and lack of visibility. It also lays out the role and responsibilities of school leaders in creating workplaces where ""staff can feel safe and be open with colleagues and with pupils"". The NAHT says 2014 research from Manchester Business School found that individuals from sexual minority groups were more than twice as likely as heterosexuals to be bullied or discriminated against in the workplace, with knock-on effects on their physical and mental health. It also notes that a 2016 review for the government's Equalities Office found very high levels of workplace bullying and harassment against trans people. The guidance advises heads to take personal responsibility for promoting inclusion and tackling bullying based on sexual orientation. It includes: zero tolerance of homophobic, biphobic and transphobic bullying and banter supporting staff to teach about LGBT issues modifying dress codes to avoid gender stereotypes sex and relationship education to include LGBT experiences not allowing complaints or fear of complaints to hamper moves towards an inclusive school environment ""We haven't made as much progress as we should on LGBT-plus rights in schools. ""We need to change that,"" said NAHT general secretary Paul Whiteman. ""Schools decide the kind of society that we have, they transform children into citizens of the world and if we aren't getting the treatment of LGBT-plus pupils and teachers right in schools then we won't be getting it right in society. ""It shouldn't take bravery to be yourself or to stand up for your colleagues' rights, but it does sometimes. ""This can have a serious impact on the mental health, happiness and motivation of school staff as well as pupils."" The union's equalities group chairwoman, Sally Bates, said that while some LGBT-plus staff chose not to be open about their sexual orientation, too many others kept quiet for fear of discrimination, bullying or harassment. Nick Ward, director of Teach First, said he wanted a world where teachers are ""not just permitted but supported and encouraged to discuss their sexual and gender identity in order to provide what all teachers aim to provide, a role model for their students"". Troy Jenkinson, a Leicestershire primary head teacher who is open about his sexuality, said: ""It is crucial for us to get it right now in our schools so we can prepare our students for accepting diversity as they become the next generation of adults. ""In the words of one of my Year 6 pupils, 'Love is love.'"" The NAHT wants all schools to behave like Grahame Colclough's where he says the wedding announcement was ""perfectly normal and exactly how it happens for all of the staff in our school who are getting married"". The guidance will be published next week on the NAHT website.
