Sturgeon: Scottish Covid surge may be levelling off,"The recent surge of Covid-19 cases in Scotland may be levelling off, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said. A further 2,802 positive cases were recorded on Thursday, with Ms Sturgeon saying there was an ""apparent slowdown"" in the rise in infections. She said this gave her cause for optimism that Scotland can move to level zero of restrictions on 19 July. However she stressed that measures such as the use of face masks and physical distancing will remain for some time. The Scottish Parliament will be recalled from recess next Tuesday for Ms Sturgeon to announce whether the easing of restrictions will go ahead as planned. Live: Latest on Covid-19 in Scotland Covid in Scotland: Where are the latest cases? The 2,802 positive tests announced on Thursday represents a drop from the 3,799 logged on Wednesday. A total of 401 people are in hospital with the virus, with 38 in intensive care, while a further four deaths have been registered. Case numbers are now 1,432 lower than they were last Thursday, while the seven-day average also appears to show a slowdown in the rise of positive cases. Ms Sturgeon said there was a ""suggestion that the recent surge in cases may be to some extent levelling off now"". However, she said figures remained worryingly high and could still put pressure on the health service. She said: ""We increasingly hear talk of learning to live with the virus, which we all want to be able to do. ""It is true that we can't live a restricted way of life forever as that in itself affects our health and wellbeing, and vaccines are offering us an alternative way forward. ""However, that desire to just live with it cannot mean we simply throw caution to the wind and no longer worry at all about rising levels of infection."" The Scottish government's route map out of lockdown would see the whole of the country move tolevel zero of restrictions,externalon 19 July, before scrapping most legal curbs altogether on 9 August. A decision is to be taken on the first step on 13 July, and Ms Sturgeon said this would be based on a careful evaluation of the latest data. She added: ""I very much hope we will be able to move ahead as planned, and the apparent slowdown in case numbers gives me more cause for optimism about that than I might have had a week ago."" However, the first minister stressed that Covid ""is going to be around for some time to come"", and said this meant some curbs would have to remain. She said: ""Its important I think to remind all of us that a move to level zero does not mean the immediate end of all restrictions. ""Many of the baseline measures like face coverings, physical distancing, hand hygiene and advising on ventilation, these are going to continue to be important mitigations to protect us and others from the virus for some time yet. ""No matter what our decision is next week, there won't be an abrupt end to these basic protective measures when we do move to level zero."" Scottish Conservative MSP Craig Hoy said continuing uncertainty over what restrictions would ease and when were not helping people's business, holiday or wedding plans. And he said it was ""not good enough"" that next week's statement would come just six days before the changes are due to come into force. Ms Sturgeon said her government was currently reviewing its policy on self-isolation rules, including for workplaces and travellers, and would announce the outcome shortly. The UK government has announced that fully-vaccinated people arriving in England from amber travel list destinationswill no longer have to quarantine from 19 July. The first minister also acknowledged the growing pressure on the NHS amid high case numbers, despite a lower proportion of people requiring hospital care. Two hospitals in the north east of Scotland have reached full capacity, withcalls for non-urgent procedures to be cancelledto ease the strain on services. Hospitals are under pressure but it is different this time. Despite soaring case numbers, far fewer people are ending up in hospital with Covid. There's also some evidence that they don't need treatment for as long. But hospitals are busier now than last year when many other procedures were postponed. Health boards say the numbers of non-Covid patients they are seeing over summer is equivalent to that usually experienced in the busier winter months. Figures from Public Health Scotland show emergency departments faced their busiest ever May, with more than 112,563 attendances. Add into that fewer available beds because of distancing requirements, juggling staff leave, staff sickness and self-isolation, and the already high vacancy rates in some areas. It doesn't take much before hospitals are at full stretch. As ever, the NHS has to prioritise those most in need of treatment and that means some are already having to postpone non-urgent surgery. The major burden on the NHS during this wave may turn out not to be Covid patients themselves but the wider impacts of the whole pandemic. Chief Medical Officer Dr Gregor Smith said the remobilisation of the health service - with procedures delayed due to the pandemic now starting up again - meant hospitals were busier than normal with non-Covid work. He added: ""What I'm hearing from colleagues is much more in the way of very complex and often quite unwell people who are presenting, particularly either in community-based services or at emergency departments, with illness which necessitates hospital admission and where the length of stay is slightly longer. ""We are also seeing increased respiratory infections, particularly in younger children where we know we have an upsurge in parainfluezna, a type of viral infection, and that is having an knock on effect on people presenting to GPs and emergency departments with unwell children.""

Amber list quarantine for fully vaccinated to end,"This video can not be played Grant Shapps announces changes to quarantine rules for the fully vaccinated Fully vaccinated UK residents arriving in England from amber travel list destinations will no longer have to quarantine from 19 July. However, they will still need to pay for Covid tests before and after their return, the transport secretary said. Grant Shapps told MPs that under-18s returning from amber list places would also be exempt from quarantine. Travel industry leaders said the change was a ""positive step"" but called for the amber list to be expanded. Currently, anyone returning from countries on the amber or red list must isolate for 10 days, regardless of vaccine status. Mr Shapps said a full vaccination means ""14 days have passed since your final dose of the vaccine"" - and only vaccines given by the NHS will count. But he said officials were ""working to extend our approach to vaccinated passengers from important markets and holiday destinations, later this summer, such as the United States and the EU"". Northern Ireland plans to adopt the changefrom 26 July, while both Scotland andWales have said they will considerwhether to follow the same rules. How can I prove I've had both my Covid jabs? Job not done on holiday rules, say travel chiefs What are the travel rules for people with both jabs? Under the change, fully-jabbed people travelling from amber list countries will still be required to take a test three days before they return and on the second day after they are back - but they will now be exempted from a day eight test. Mr Shapps told MPs: ""In essence, this means that for fully vaccinated travellers the requirements for green and amber list countries are the same."" He also said that, from 19 July - the daywhen most Covid rules in England are due to end- the guidance that people should not travel to amber list countries will be removed. But he cautioned that ""an amber list country could still turn red"", meaning hotel quarantine would become a requirement. All of England's 19 July rule changes are due to be confirmed on 12 July after a review of the latest data. Heathrow Airport welcomed the news, but called for the rules to be eased even further Fewer than 30 destinations are on the green list - meaning travellers do not have to self-isolate when they get back to the UK, while more than 50 countries are on the strictest red list, which requires arrivals to pay to self-isolate in a hotel. But most places - including holiday hotspots such as mainland Spain, Greece and the US - are on the amber list. The next review of the countries on the green, red and amber lists will take place on 15 July. Speaking later, the transport secretary told the BBC: ""We had the choice of simply saying people would never be able to travel until every single last person had been vaccinated - or at least starting to open things up."" Mr Shapps said testing was ""important to keep people safe"" and prevent variants arriving in the UK, but denied the requirements would continue to price-out many families. On Thursday evening, thegovernment website was listing nearly 400 providers,externalcarrying out the tests fully vaccinated travellers would need to take on their return. Prices begin at Â£2.49, with the majority in the Â£50-Â£100 range. The Foreign Office, which issues travel advice that is independent from the government's traffic light system and could affect travel insurance, is stressing that not all amber countries will be approved for international travel on 19 July. However, it has updated its approved list and it now has several amber list countries including France, Greece, Morocco, Switzerland, the US, Jamaica and mainland Spain. For the first time in a while, travel bosses are relatively pleased. Today's announcement is a big change, opening up international travel far more significantly that has been possible this year. However, there are limitations. This policy only applies to those jabbed in the UK, meaning those jabbed abroad will still have to quarantine if coming from an amber list country. That will affect some family and friends hoping to reunite and impact on businesses that rely on international visitors who won't see those customers return in the same numbers as UK travellers will leave. Tests are still required from green and amber list countries. The cost will dissuade some from travelling. Crucially, this rule is just about what happens when people travel to the UK. Whether other countries will let UK travellers in is a different matter altogether. Tim Alderslade, chief executive of Airlines UK, the industry body representing UK-registered carriers, said the rule change was a ""positive move towards the genuine reopening the sector has been looking for"". John Holland-Kaye, chief executive of Heathrow, welcomed the change but said: ""The UK should open up travel to fully vaccinated people from more countries - particularly our key partners in the US - by the end of July."" However, MP Caroline Lucas - vice-chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Coronavirus, said the government was ""in danger of repeating the same mistakes that allowed the Delta variant to take root in the UK"". Katherine Wood, a post-doctoral researcher at the University of Oxford, will not get a second jab until the end of August and told the BBC the government changes were frustrating for young people who had already sacrificed a ""huge amount"" during the pandemic. The 26-year-old said: ""They should have waited until the vast majority of people, particularly young people, had been double-vaccinated before changing any rules because I really feel quite disenfranchised by what's happened."" The traffic light system sets the rules travellers must follow on their return. But holidaymakers also need tocheck their destination's entry rules. For example, all non-vaccinated travellers to mainlandPortugalneed a negative Covid test, and must quarantine for 14 days. Twelve to 17-year-olds travelling with fully vaccinated parents don't have to quarantine but need a negative test. Under-11s are exempt. Only fully vaccinated adults can travel toMalta, and do not need a negative test. Children aged five to 11 can travel with fully vaccinated adults, but need a negative test. Under-fives don't need a test. Unvaccinated 12 to 17-year olds can't enter. Over-12s travelling toSpainneed a negative test or proof of vaccination. Unvaccinated travellers can only enterFrancefor ""essential reasons"", and must self-isolate for seven days. Fully-vaccinated adults with a negative test can enter. Under-18s travelling with fully vaccinated adults don't need to self-isolate. Earlier, Chancellor Rishi Sunak told the BBC that in addition to relaxing the rules around isolation for travellers, the government was considering a ""more proportionate and balanced approach"" to isolation for Covid contacts. It comes amid fears that surging cases will lead to millions of people being asked to self-isolate during the summer, even if they have been fully vaccinated. The requirement for double-jabbed people to isolate after contact with a positive case is due to end on 16 August, four weeks after the majority of England's Covid rules are set to end, to allow more people to be vaccinated. Mr Sunak acknowledged there was ""frustration"" at how theNHS contact tracing appcould continue to order the double jabbed to isolate. Dr Jenny Harries, head of the UK Health Security Agency, urged people to continue using the app - saying it had helped to detect about 500,000 cases to date - but told the Commons Public Accounts Committee work was being done to ""tune"" it to operate within the vaccinated population so it was there ""for a purpose, not for annoyance"". Nearly 65% of the adult population in the UK have received two jabs, and 86% have had a first dose. A total of 32,551 new UK coronavirus caseswere announced on Thursday,external- up very slightly on Wednesday and taking the total number of positive tests in the pandemic above five million. There were also 35 more deaths. DOING RANDOM ACTS OF KINDNESS:What happens when we're kind to strangers? ""MY DISABILITY WAS A FACTOR"":Why are disabled women more likely to be harassed?

Haiti seeks masterminds behind president's killing,"This video can not be played Haiti parades suspects after president's murder A group of 28 foreign mercenaries, including retired Colombian soldiers, assassinated Haiti's President Jovenel MoÃ¯se earlier this week, police say. After a gun battle in the capital Port-au-Prince, 17 were detained, some at the house they were using, others after entering Taiwan's diplomatic compound. Three suspects were killed by police and eight are still being sought. Bloodied and bruised, arrested suspects were shown to the media on Thursday, along with a slew of seized weapons. It is still unclear who organised the attack and with what motive. Also unclear is who is in charge of the country. On Friday, a group of political parties added to that uncertainty by nominating a president, although how much legitimacy that has is unknown. The attack took place in the early hours of Wednesday, when gunmen broke into the president's home in Port-au-Prince, shooting him dead and wounding his wife. Mr MoÃ¯se, 53, was found lying on his back with 12 bullet wounds and a gouged eye, according to authorities. Martine MoÃ¯se, 47, was seriously wounded and is in a stable condition after being flown to Florida for treatment. Police said the hit squad included mainly Colombians, along with two Haitian-Americans. Found in the suspects' possession were firearms, sets of US dollar bills, the president's personal chequebook and the server that held surveillance camera footage from his home, Le Nouvelliste newspaper reported. Taiwan confirmed that 11 of the suspects were arrested after breaking into a courtyard at its compound. What we know about the killing so far Angry civilians had joined the search for the gunmen, and helped police track down some who were hiding in bushes. The crowd set fire to three of the suspects' cars and destroyed evidence. Axes, wire-cutters, sets of US dollar bills and Colombian passports have been seized Police chief LÃ©on Charles called for calm, saying the public should not take the law into their own hands. At the news conference on Thursday, police showed reporters Colombian passports. ""Foreigners came to our country to kill the president,"" Mr Charles said, as the suspects sat on the floor behind him in handcuffs. Colombia's government has pledged to assist Haiti with its investigation efforts. Colombian police director, Gen Jorge Luis Vargas, said 17 former Colombian soldiers were thought to be involved. The US state department, meanwhile, said it could not confirm if any of its citizens had been detained. However, US and Canadian media are reporting that one of the dual citizens arrested, James Solages, 35, is from Florida and was a former bodyguard at the Canadian embassy in Haiti. An investigating judge told local media that Mr Solages and the other US citizen, named as Joseph Vincent, had said they were there as translators for the mercenaries, after finding the job on the internet. ""The mission was to arrest President Jovenel MoÃ¯se... and not to kill him,"" Judge ClÃ©ment NoÃ«l told Le Nouvelliste. The US said on Friday it was sending FBI and Department of Homeland Security officials to Haiti following the nation's request for help in the investigation. Members of Mr MoÃ¯se's security detail have been summoned before Haiti's courts to answer questions about its failures. Large crowds surrounded the PÃ©tion-Ville Police station in Port-au-Prince where the men have been detained Colombian daily El Tiempo said that it had seen confidential documents that named the Colombian suspects. The paper's research suggests that four of them flew from Colombia to the Dominican Republic on 4 June. They crossed by land from there into Haiti two days later. The two countries share the island of Hispaniola. According to El Tiempo, Colombian intelligence has seen photos posted on social media by members of the group, showing them posing at a popular tourist spot in the Dominican Republic. The killing has triggered some civil unrest in Haiti, the poorest nation in the Americas. A state of emergency remains in force across the country, while the Dominican Republic has closed its border. The situation has been unclear and is getting murkier. In this particular situation, the constitution says the National Assembly should choose another president. But disputes meant that elections scheduled for October 2019 did not take place - and Mr MoÃ¯se had been ruling by decree amid widespread protests. Amendments to the constitution - not accepted by everyone - suggest the prime minister should be the next one to take over. But Haiti has both an interim prime minister, Claude Joseph, and a new appointee, Ariel Henry, who has yet to be sworn in. Both are claiming to be in charge. On Friday, a group of political parties signed a resolution proclaiming a new president - Joseph Lambert - with Mr Henry acting as his PM. The situation is doing little to resolve the political and economic instability that has long plagued the nation.  11 millioninhabitants 59%percentage who live below the poverty line 2004-2017years in which a UN peacekeeping force was present 200,000number of people killed in the 2010 earthquake US charges four over Haiti president assassination Haiti's president killed in attack at home Dispute over Haiti presidency triggers unrest Why are there so many protests in Haiti?

People 'snapping up' post-Covid bucket list trips,"People are dreaming of holidays to the Maldives next year, travel agents say People are planning bucket list holidays due to ""pent up demand"" for a break, according to Welsh travel agents. They said places like the Maldives were being snapped up for 2022 with people ""definitely spending more"". But, for this year, the demand remains for UK staycations. Accommodation with hot tubs are proving popular along with cottages and lodges for families holidaying at home. The Welsh government has said people should only go abroad for ""essential purposes"", and First Minister Mark Drakeford has urged people to stay in Wales this year. Suzanne Cumpston, from Sam Smith Travel in Cowbridge, said the desire for international travel appears to have been ""suppressed"" for now - but longer term, people were looking to travel further afield. ""The appetite for 2021 is leaning towards UK staycations,"" she said. Summer bookings are made up of breaks at UK lodges and cottages, she said, with hot tubs a requirement whenever possible. Other customers have booked holidays to the Maldives, the US, Iceland and the Greek islands from the latter part of the year in the hope they can go ahead. Hot tubs are a requirement for staycations, say travel agents And one customer has just booked a Â£65,000 wedding party of about 15 people to Antigua in 2022. ""People are booking to go longer, [to] bucket list places and upgrading rooms because they have lost out,"" she said. Is it possible to visit France, Spain or other destinations? Holidays on the amber list - what you need to know Other travel agents told BBC Wales that customers have increased their holiday budget and booked luxury breaks to places including Mauritius and the Canadian Rockies in 2022. But for now many have opted for staycations in Wales, Devon, Cornwall and onUK cruises. Mark White, boss of Ocky White Travel, Haverfordwest, said ""it seems everything with a hot tub will sell"" when it comes to booking a holiday at home. He said he was advising people ""not to commit to 2021 foreign holidays"" until further reviews of the travel traffic light system and in the hope the green list will open up. Wales has atraffic light systemof travel, like in England, meaning countries are categorised due to risk. Portugal has now moved to the amber list, meaning arrivals must take two tests and quarantine for 10 days. ""Some people are still determined to go away,"" said Mr White. ""We are seeing more wish-list destinations coming through. ""People have learned not to take anything for granted and to take opportunities when they arise,"" he said. Sue Glen: ""You have to get on and enjoy your life"" Travel agent Darren Owen said customers at Snowdonia Travel and Cruise in Colwyn Bay have rescheduled foreign holidays up to four times due to Covid travel rules. He said that made it financially difficult for independent travel agents who do not receive their commission until a few weeks before people go on holiday. What's happening with foreign travel? Scramble to return as Portugal joins amber list Mr Owen said older people who have had their second Covid vaccine were booking foreign holidays for November and December, while families were booking to go abroad next May and June. Self employed travel agent Sue Glen, from Builth Wells, has taken up a second job as a Covid track and trace official with Powys council to help pay her bills, with customers also delaying their breaks up to four times. Fingers crossed: Angie Willmott is planning breaks in Crete and the Caribbean this year She said new foreign holiday bookings to places like the Maldives, Thailand and the US appeared to be more lavish, especially if customers have been able to save money during lockdown. And she said people holidaying at home were also prepared to pay in excess of Â£1,500 for a week's stay in a UK holiday cottage in order to ""make memories"". Holiday let firms 'blown away' by surge in demand Can I go on holiday abroad from Wales? ""You have to get on and enjoy your life,"" she said. ""So many times I have had that conversation with customers. ""We have had a pretty awful few years."" Health club receptionist Angie Willmott, from Cardiff, ""just loves holidays"". She has just returned from a weekend in Cornwall, and hopes to be able to enjoy breaks in Crete in July and a Caribbean cruise in December, if they are on the green list. ""We need to have some optimism,"" she said.

Benefits rules to be eased for terminally ill,"Terminally ill people with less than a year to live will get fast-tracked for benefits after ministers said they will expand the timeframe for those eligible for special consideration. Previously patients had to prove they had less than six months to live and charities say many died without their cases being resolved. It is two years since a government review was launched into the issue. Campaigners say it is a ""significant step forward"". They have been seeking a change to how terminally ill people access benefit support, known as Personal Independence Payments (PIP). Under the current rules, patients in England and Wales must provide medical proof that they have six months or less to live to access benefits quickly and at a higher rate. And if they live longer than three years after benefits are awarded, they have to be reassessed. Charities and some MPs say people have endured distress trying to wade through red tape, filling in forms and attending interviews with benefits advisers. And some patients have died waiting for the welfare benefits they need. Helen Nicell, who has stage 4 cancer, told the BBC her payment was reduced initially when she was moved from disability allowance to PIP because a doctor could not say she was likely to die within six months. This video can not be played Personal Independence Payments: 'Have I less than six months to live?' She said: ""To have to ask your consultant - do you think I may only have six months to live -  when really they can't answer that, it's a very, very difficult question and very difficult to live with. ""The consultant said it was actually impossible to put a prognosis on how long it would take. ""The cancer is in my spine and at any point it could spread in to one of my organs"" she said. She added: ""When you have retired from work and you have a budget and you have no other income"" the uncertainty of waiting for an assessment to come through is very hard. In a written statement to MPs,  Minister for Disabled People, Justin Tomlinson, said the changes will ""increase much needed support for people who are nearing the end of their lives"". He said the new 12-month approach ""will ensure people get the financial help they need as quickly as possible in the most challenging of times."" ""Under the updated rules, clinicians still have discretion and will be supported by a realistic and straightforward definition"" he added. In an interview with BBC News, Mr Tomlinson said under the special rules, payments can be made within four to five days rather than 16 weeks. He said the changes will bring the benefits system in line with the NHS definition of terminal illness, which is having less than twelve months to live. ""What clinicians were telling us was about removing duplication"", he said. ""The GP and the patient would have this devastating awful conversation at 12 months as part of the NHS role and then they would have to come and have it a second time with us to get the GPs the [benefits] form at six months"". Matthew Reed, Chief Executive of Marie Curie welcomed the announcement as a ""significant step forward"", and a ""tribute to all those who bravely shared their experiences of the benefits system"". ""This will help ensure that more dying people can concentrate on making the most of the limited time they have left, rather than worrying about their finances. ""There is more to be done, but this is important progress and we look forward to working with the UK Government to bring in this change as quickly as possible"", he said. Sally Light, CEO of the Motor Neurone Disease Association said the recommendations ""must be implemented quickly"". ""No more people already facing the most difficult time of their life [should] have to wait to claim the support they not only desperately need but are entitled to"". The changes will not happen immediately - ministers say the law will be changed within 12 months ""when parliamentary time allows"". The reforms  in England and Wales follow similar pledges in the devolved administrations in Northern Ireland and Scotland. Last week the Stormont Assembly signalled it intended to scrap the six month rule for those with terminal illnesses. And in 2019, Holyrood said it intended to do the same, with guidelines for clinicians due to be published this summer.

Police chief apologises for bomb response failings,"Deputy Chief Constable Ian Pilling has apologised to families of the 22 people who died A police chief has apologised ""unreservedly"" for failings by his force in the emergency service response to the Manchester Arena bombing. Deputy Chief Constable Ian Pilling said Greater Manchester Police's failure to establish effective inter-service communications was ""unacceptable"". He was giving evidence at the public inquiry into the May 2017 attack which killed 22 people and injured hundreds. Mr Pilling also praised the actions of the ""brave"" first responders. ""I would like to offer condolences from Greater Manchester Police (GMP) to all those who lost loved ones, who suffered injuries or hurt, or have been affected in any way by the tragic events at the Manchester Arena in 2017,"" he said. ""The response of so many of our staff, particularly first responders on the night, was exemplary, extraordinarily brave and quite humbling. ""However, I would like to acknowledge and apologise for failings by Greater Manchester Police, principally failing to carry out the basic functions of Jesip (Joint Emergency Services Interoperability Principles) in the early stages of the incident which impacted considerably on joint working."" Mr Pilling said a failure to notify other emergency services of the declaration of Operation Plato - a pre-planned response to a terror incident - and a failure to establish effective communications with other emergency services was ""unacceptable and we apologise for this unreservedly"". ""This is an apology not just to the victims and the families but also to all those affected by the attack including our emergency services colleagues,"" he said. He said ""significant work"" had been undertaken to address many of the issues and added: ""I would like to give absolute assurance our efforts to address these failings and any others which are identified will continue in the future."" Twenty-two people were killed in the May 2017 bombing The inquiry has heard the other blue light emergency services were unable to get through to the phone line of GMP's force duty officer (FDO), the initial commander of the incident. Only three paramedics entered the City Room foyer - the scene of the blast at the end of an Ariana Grande concert - and the fire service attended more than two hours later. Nick de la Poer QC, counsel to the inquiry, asked Mr Pilling: ""From what you have seen of the evidence, was there sufficient resilience around the FDO on the night of 22 May?"" Mr Pilling replied: ""I believe if certain things had been in place or if actions had been allocated in a certain way by the FDO then in terms of the number of people, the resilience around him, I believe yes there was."" The officer agreed there was insufficient effort put in up to the first 90 minutes after the explosion to ensure all emergency service partners met at a rendezvous point. He accepted GMP must share a responsibility for that failure as it was the primary partner in the terrorist response and was expected to take the lead. Geoff Harris said on the night of the attack, there was a failure of leadership within the fire service A senior fire chief has also apologised for a ""gross failure"" in the Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service (GMFRS) response to the attack. Retired assistant chief fire officer Geoff Harris, who was effectively second in command on the night, said the response was ""completely unacceptable"". ""It was far from adequate or effective,"" he told the inquiry. ""I extend my personal apologies for the failure of the fire and rescue service to respond adequately on that night. ""I don't think there's any one single point of failure. There are a number of issues that arose."" Fire manager angry at arena bomb response Arena police chief probed over inquiry evidence Fire service bomb response was a 'catastrophe' Mr Harris, who had more than 35 years of service before retiring, said some of his officers were ""stuck in a loop"" of trying to contact the police and displayed ""some inertia"" in overcoming the communication problems. Paul Greaney QC, lead counsel to the inquiry, asked if the delay represented ""not just a failure but a gross failure in response"". Mr Harris replied: ""It does, sir."" He agreed that on the night there had been a failure of leadership within GMFRS and that it was ""too risk averse"" in its response. A few hours after the bombing, Mr Harris met firefighters who were ""fuming"" about the failed response. He recalled there was a ""ring of firefighters around me"" demanding answers which he was unable to give. ""Not only did we let down the people of Greater Manchester, we let those firefighters down,"" he said. The inquiry continues.

Biden defends US withdrawal amid Taliban advance,"US President Joe Biden has defended his decision to withdraw military forces from Afghanistan, saying that US operations will end on 31 August. The fourth US president to oversee the war also defended the speed of the US withdrawal, saying it saved lives. Mr Biden's speech comes as the Taliban militant group continues to seize territory around the country. US forces have fought in Afghanistan for nearly 20 years, following the terror attacks of 11 September 2001. Earlier this year, Mr Biden set a 11 September 2021 goal of withdrawing all US troops. Donald Trump had agreed with the Taliban to pull out US troops by May 2021, but that deadline was pushed back by Mr Biden after he took office in January. This video can not be played Biden: 'We did not go to Afghanistan to nation build' ""Just one more year of fighting in Afghanistan is not a solution,"" Mr Biden said in a White House speech, ""but a recipe for fighting there indefinitely."" He also denied that a Taliban takeover is ""inevitable,"" saying that the Taliban force of approximately 75,000 fighters is no match for the 300,000 Afghan security forces. Even after the total pull out is complete, the US is expected to keep 650 to 1,000 troops in Afghanistan to guard the US embassy, Kabul airport, and other key government installations. Recent polls have shown broad US support for leaving Afghanistan, with Republican voters more sceptical of the decision to withdraw. Mr Biden also said that efforts are being made to get translators, interpreters and other Afghans that worked with the US government out of the country. He said 2,500 special immigrant visas have been issued to allow them to come to the United States, but only half have come so far. Senator Biden and Vice-President Biden believed the US should get out of Afghanistan. Now President Biden is Commander-in-Chief. He was at pains to say support for Afghanistan wouldn't stop, but even more adamant that both Afghan politicians and security forces had the capacity to prevent a Taliban takeover. ""Will they do it?"" he asked. That's what Afghans have asked - repeatedly - in the midst of continuing disarray and disunity in Kabul, and the dramatic Taliban advance in the districts. The president's emphasis on speaking out for women and girls isn't heard in districts already under Taliban control where they're not going to school. As a president who's known to study all the scenarios, he made it clear ""it's highly unlikely"" there will be a unified government, and not much the US could do, or should do, if Kabul collapses. That's up to Afghans - and the countries next door. Last month, Mr Biden assured Afghan leaders at a White House meeting that US aid will continue. Most British troops have left Afghanistan - PM The vast majority of remaining foreign forces in Afghanistan have left ahead of the US 11 September deadline, leaving the Afghan military completely in charge of national security. President Ashraf Ghani insists that Afghan security forces are fully capable of keeping insurgents at bay, but there have been reports of thousands of Afghan troops seeking refuge in other countries to avoid the fighting. Earlier in the week,Taliban spokesman Suhail Shaheen told the BBC that the group was not responsible for the recent increase in violence.  He insisted that many districts had fallen to the Taliban through mediation after Afghan soldiers refused to fight. US-led forces ousted the Taliban from power in Afghanistan in 2001. The group had been harbouring Osama Bin Laden and other al-Qaeda figures linked to the 9/11 attacks in the US that triggered the invasion. However, it has gradually been regaining territory in recent years. From 9/11, to intense fighting on the ground, and now full withdrawal of US-led forces, hereâs what happened. 11 September 2001 Al-Qaeda, led by Osama Bin Laden in Afghanistan, carries out the largest terror attack ever conducted on US soil. Four commercial airliners are hijacked. Two are flown into the World Trade Centre in New York, which collapses. One hits the Pentagon building in Washington, and one crashes into a field in Pennsylvania. Nearly 3,000 people are killed. 7 October 2001 A US-led coalition bombs Taliban and al-Qaeda facilities in Afghanistan. Targets include Kabul, Kandahar and Jalalabad. The Taliban, who took power after a decade-long Soviet occupation was followed by civil war, refuse to hand over Bin Laden. Their air defences and small fleet of fighter aircraft are destroyed. 13 November 2001 The Northern Alliance, a group of anti-Taliban rebels backed by coalition forces, enters Kabul as the Taliban flee the city. By the 13 November 2001, all Taliban have either fled or been neutralised. Other cities quickly fall. 26 January 2004 After protracted negotiations at a “loya jirga” or grand assembly, the new Afghan constitution is signed into law. The constitution paves the way for presidential elections in October 2004. 7 December 2004 Hamid Karzai, the leader of the Popalzai Durrani tribe, becomes the first president under the new constitution. He serves two five-year terms as president. May 2006 British troops arrive in Helmand province, a Taliban stronghold in the south of the country. Their initial mission is to support reconstruction projects, but they are quickly drawn into combat operations. More than 450 British troops lose their lives in Afghanistan over the course of the conflict. 17 February 2009 US President Barack Obama approves a major increase in the number of troops sent to Afghanistan. At their peak, they number about 140,000. The so-called “surge” is modelled on US strategy in Iraq where US forces focussed on protecting the civilian population as well as killing insurgent fighters. 2 May 2011 The leader of al-Qaeda is killed in an assault by US Navy Seals on a compound in Abbottabad in Pakistan. Bin Ladenâs body is removed and buried at sea. The operation ends a 10-year hunt led by the CIA. Â The confirmation that Bin Laden had been living on Pakistani soil fuels accusations in the US that Pakistan is an unreliable ally in the war on terror. 23 April 2013 The founder of the Taliban, Mullah Mohammed Omar, dies. His death is kept secret for more than two years. According to Afghan intelligence, Mullah Omar dies of health problems at a hospital in the Pakistani city of Karachi. Pakistan denies that he was in the country. 28 December 2014 At a ceremony in Kabul, Nato ends its combat operations in Afghanistan. With the surge now over, the US withdraws thousands of troops. Â Most of those who remain focus on training and supporting the Afghan security forces. 2015 The Taliban launch a series of suicide attacks, car bombings and other assaults. The parliament building in Kabul, and the city of Kunduz are attacked. Islamic State militants begin operations in Afghanistan. 25 January 2019 Afghan President Ashraf Ghani says more than 45,000 members of his countryâs security forces have been killed since he became leader in 2014. The figure is far higher than previously thought. 29 February 2020 The US and the Taliban sign an “agreement for bringing peace” to Afghanistan, in Doha, Qatar. The US and Nato allies agree to withdraw all troops within 14 months if the militants uphold the deal. 13 April 2021 US president Joe Biden announces that all US troops will leave Afghanistan by 11 September 2021. 16 August 2021 In just over a month, the Taliban sweep across Afghanistan, taking control of towns and cities all over the country, including Kabul.

Haiti hunts motive as president's 'assassins' held,"This video can not be played Haiti parades suspects after president's murder A group of 28 foreign mercenaries, including retired Colombian soldiers, assassinated Haiti's President Jovenel MoÃ¯se earlier this week, police say. After a gun battle in the capital Port-au-Prince, 17 were detained, some at the house they were using, others after entering Taiwan's diplomatic compound. Three suspects were killed by police and eight are still being sought. Bloodied and bruised, arrested suspects were shown to the media on Thursday, along with a slew of seized weapons. It is still unclear who organised the attack and with what motive. Also unclear is who is in charge of the country. On Friday, a group of political parties added to that uncertainty by nominating a president, although how much legitimacy that has is unknown. The attack took place in the early hours of Wednesday, when gunmen broke into the president's home in Port-au-Prince, shooting him dead and wounding his wife. Mr MoÃ¯se, 53, was found lying on his back with 12 bullet wounds and a gouged eye, according to authorities. Martine MoÃ¯se, 47, was seriously wounded and is in a stable condition after being flown to Florida for treatment. Police said the hit squad included mainly Colombians, along with two Haitian-Americans. Found in the suspects' possession were firearms, sets of US dollar bills, the president's personal chequebook and the server that held surveillance camera footage from his home, Le Nouvelliste newspaper reported. Taiwan confirmed that 11 of the suspects were arrested after breaking into a courtyard at its compound. What we know about the killing so far Angry civilians had joined the search for the gunmen, and helped police track down some who were hiding in bushes. The crowd set fire to three of the suspects' cars and destroyed evidence. Axes, wire-cutters, sets of US dollar bills and Colombian passports have been seized Police chief LÃ©on Charles called for calm, saying the public should not take the law into their own hands. At the news conference on Thursday, police showed reporters Colombian passports. ""Foreigners came to our country to kill the president,"" Mr Charles said, as the suspects sat on the floor behind him in handcuffs. Colombia's government has pledged to assist Haiti with its investigation efforts. Colombian police director, Gen Jorge Luis Vargas, said 17 former Colombian soldiers were thought to be involved. The US state department, meanwhile, said it could not confirm if any of its citizens had been detained. However, US and Canadian media are reporting that one of the dual citizens arrested, James Solages, 35, is from Florida and was a former bodyguard at the Canadian embassy in Haiti. An investigating judge told local media that Mr Solages and the other US citizen, named as Joseph Vincent, had said they were there as translators for the mercenaries, after finding the job on the internet. ""The mission was to arrest President Jovenel MoÃ¯se... and not to kill him,"" Judge ClÃ©ment NoÃ«l told Le Nouvelliste. The US said on Friday it was sending FBI and Department of Homeland Security officials to Haiti following the nation's request for help in the investigation. Members of Mr MoÃ¯se's security detail have been summoned before Haiti's courts to answer questions about its failures. Large crowds surrounded the PÃ©tion-Ville Police station in Port-au-Prince where the men have been detained Colombian daily El Tiempo said that it had seen confidential documents that named the Colombian suspects. The paper's research suggests that four of them flew from Colombia to the Dominican Republic on 4 June. They crossed by land from there into Haiti two days later. The two countries share the island of Hispaniola. According to El Tiempo, Colombian intelligence has seen photos posted on social media by members of the group, showing them posing at a popular tourist spot in the Dominican Republic. The killing has triggered some civil unrest in Haiti, the poorest nation in the Americas. A state of emergency remains in force across the country, while the Dominican Republic has closed its border. The situation has been unclear and is getting murkier. In this particular situation, the constitution says the National Assembly should choose another president. But disputes meant that elections scheduled for October 2019 did not take place - and Mr MoÃ¯se had been ruling by decree amid widespread protests. Amendments to the constitution - not accepted by everyone - suggest the prime minister should be the next one to take over. But Haiti has both an interim prime minister, Claude Joseph, and a new appointee, Ariel Henry, who has yet to be sworn in. Both are claiming to be in charge. On Friday, a group of political parties signed a resolution proclaiming a new president - Joseph Lambert - with Mr Henry acting as his PM. The situation is doing little to resolve the political and economic instability that has long plagued the nation.  11 millioninhabitants 59%percentage who live below the poverty line 2004-2017years in which a UN peacekeeping force was present 200,000number of people killed in the 2010 earthquake US charges four over Haiti president assassination Haiti's president killed in attack at home Dispute over Haiti presidency triggers unrest Why are there so many protests in Haiti?

Senator Biden and Vice-President Biden believed the US should get out of Afghanistan. Now President Biden is Commander-in-Chief. He was at pains to say support for Afghanistan wouldn't stop, but even more adamant that both Afghan politicians and security forces had the capacity to prevent a Taliban takeover. ""Will they do it?"" he asked. That's what Afghans have asked - repeatedly - in the midst of continuing disarray and disunity in Kabul, and the dramatic Taliban advance in the districts. The president's emphasis on speaking out for women and girls isn't heard in districts already under Taliban control where they're not going to school. As a president who's known to study all the scenarios, he made it clear ""it's highly unlikely"" there will be a unified government, and not much the US could do, or should do, if Kabul collapses. That's up to Afghans - and the countries next door. Last month, Mr Biden assured Afghan leaders at a White House meeting that US aid will continue. Most British troops have left Afghanistan - PM The vast majority of remaining foreign forces in Afghanistan have left ahead of the US 11 September deadline, leaving the Afghan military completely in charge of national security. President Ashraf Ghani insists that Afghan security forces are fully capable of keeping insurgents at bay, but there have been reports of thousands of Afghan troops seeking refuge in other countries to avoid the fighting. Earlier in the week,Taliban spokesman Suhail Shaheen told the BBC that the group was not responsible for the recent increase in violence.  He insisted that many districts had fallen to the Taliban through mediation after Afghan soldiers refused to fight. US-led forces ousted the Taliban from power in Afghanistan in 2001. The group had been harbouring Osama Bin Laden and other al-Qaeda figures linked to the 9/11 attacks in the US that triggered the invasion. However, it has gradually been regaining territory in recent years. From 9/11, to intense fighting on the ground, and now full withdrawal of US-led forces, hereâs what happened. 11 September 2001 Al-Qaeda, led by Osama Bin Laden in Afghanistan, carries out the largest terror attack ever conducted on US soil. Four commercial airliners are hijacked. Two are flown into the World Trade Centre in New York, which collapses. One hits the Pentagon building in Washington, and one crashes into a field in Pennsylvania. Nearly 3,000 people are killed. 7 October 2001 A US-led coalition bombs Taliban and al-Qaeda facilities in Afghanistan. Targets include Kabul, Kandahar and Jalalabad. The Taliban, who took power after a decade-long Soviet occupation was followed by civil war, refuse to hand over Bin Laden. Their air defences and small fleet of fighter aircraft are destroyed. 13 November 2001 The Northern Alliance, a group of anti-Taliban rebels backed by coalition forces, enters Kabul as the Taliban flee the city. By the 13 November 2001, all Taliban have either fled or been neutralised. Other cities quickly fall. 26 January 2004 After protracted negotiations at a “loya jirga” or grand assembly, the new Afghan constitution is signed into law. The constitution paves the way for presidential elections in October 2004. 7 December 2004 Hamid Karzai, the leader of the Popalzai Durrani tribe, becomes the first president under the new constitution. He serves two five-year terms as president. May 2006 British troops arrive in Helmand province, a Taliban stronghold in the south of the country. Their initial mission is to support reconstruction projects, but they are quickly drawn into combat operations. More than 450 British troops lose their lives in Afghanistan over the course of the conflict. 17 February 2009 US President Barack Obama approves a major increase in the number of troops sent to Afghanistan. At their peak, they number about 140,000. The so-called “surge” is modelled on US strategy in Iraq where US forces focussed on protecting the civilian population as well as killing insurgent fighters. 2 May 2011 The leader of al-Qaeda is killed in an assault by US Navy Seals on a compound in Abbottabad in Pakistan. Bin Ladenâs body is removed and buried at sea. The operation ends a 10-year hunt led by the CIA. Â The confirmation that Bin Laden had been living on Pakistani soil fuels accusations in the US that Pakistan is an unreliable ally in the war on terror. 23 April 2013 The founder of the Taliban, Mullah Mohammed Omar, dies. His death is kept secret for more than two years. According to Afghan intelligence, Mullah Omar dies of health problems at a hospital in the Pakistani city of Karachi. Pakistan denies that he was in the country. 28 December 2014 At a ceremony in Kabul, Nato ends its combat operations in Afghanistan. With the surge now over, the US withdraws thousands of troops. Â Most of those who remain focus on training and supporting the Afghan security forces. 2015 The Taliban launch a series of suicide attacks, car bombings and other assaults. The parliament building in Kabul, and the city of Kunduz are attacked. Islamic State militants begin operations in Afghanistan. 25 January 2019 Afghan President Ashraf Ghani says more than 45,000 members of his countryâs security forces have been killed since he became leader in 2014. The figure is far higher than previously thought. 29 February 2020 The US and the Taliban sign an “agreement for bringing peace” to Afghanistan, in Doha, Qatar. The US and Nato allies agree to withdraw all troops within 14 months if the militants uphold the deal. 13 April 2021 US president Joe Biden announces that all US troops will leave Afghanistan by 11 September 2021. 16 August 2021 In just over a month, the Taliban sweep across Afghanistan, taking control of towns and cities all over the country, including Kabul.

Chancellor hints at ruling out 8% pension rise,"This video can not be played Chancellor Rishi Sunak: ""We want to make sure the decisions we make are fair... both for pensioners and for taxpayers"" The chancellor has given his strongest indication yet of ruling out a predicted 8% rise in the state pension next year. Official forecasts suggest that the link with earnings growth could mean the bumper rise in the amount paid from April 2022. Rishi Sunak told the BBC a decision on pensions would be ""based on fairness for pensioners and for taxpayers"". Various commentators have called for an overhaul of the rules. However, groups representing older people say the government's promises to pensioners should remain. Mr Sunak told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""The triple lock is government policy but I recognise people's concerns about what that might mean, given some of the numbers that are being put around. ""We will approach these decisions with fairness in mind - fairness for both pensioners but also for taxpayers."" He said there were ""some questions around the earnings numbers"". The rise in pensions each year is governed by what is known as the triple lock - a Conservative manifesto promise until at least 2024. This means the state pension increases in line with the rising cost of living seen in the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) measure of inflation, increasing average wages, or 2.5%, whichever of those three is highest. Predictions by the Bank of England suggest that average earnings could go up by 8%, hence the equivalent rise in the state pension. State pension predicted to rise by 8% Public finances at risk after Covid, says watchdog That would cost the Treasury Â£3bn more than previously anticipated, according to the government's official forecaster - the Office for Budget Responsibility. Many economists point out the sharp rise in earnings is an anomaly created, in part, by calculations being affected by people coming off furlough. There is no reason in law why the chancellor cannot change the way earnings are judged in the triple lock system. He is certainly under pressure to do some from some quarters. Lord David Willetts, president of the Resolution Foundation, a think tank focusing on people on lower incomes, said: ""The Covid crisis has laid bare the design faults of the triple lock, with a severe jobs crisis last year inadvertently contributing to an unnecessary and unjustified 8% rise in the state pension next year. ""The chancellor should take the opportunity this autumn to replace the triple lock with a smoothed earnings link. This would mean the state pension would rise in line with the living standards of working age people - a change that would be fair to all generations."" However, Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK, said: ""We do not think the government should rush headlong towards a decision to suspend it. Pensioner poverty has been rising in recent years. ""While older people we speak to are generally keen to do their bit to help as the pandemic continues, they are also wary of unscrupulous policymakers who might want use exceptional times as a reason to make permanent changes - a government sleight of hand that would not be acceptable at all."" The chancellor said that he would hold ""fairness in mind"" for any decision that it is made, but fairness can be hard to quantify. At present: The full, new flat-rate state pension (for those who reached state pension age after April 2016) is Â£179.60 a week The full, old basic state pension (for those who reached state pension age before April 2016) is Â£137.60 a week That is one of the least generous state pensions in Europe, even if there was a significant rise next year. The former pensions minister, Baroness Ros Altmann, also pointed out that, for many people, the state pension was their only retirement income. ""Millions of pensioners - especially women - rely solely on state pensions because they did not have the opportunity to build up private pensions when younger,"" she said. She has called for a wholesale review of pensioner benefits, rather than a short-term change in the rules. Other considerations of ""fairness"" might also include the wide range of life expectancy in different parts of the country, the different rules determining the rise in Pension Credit - a state pension top-up, and the expectations of younger people about their eventual state pension entitlement. At a time when the official recommendation for the main NHS pay award is well below inflation, a rise of 8% for the state pension would appear to be an outlier. The chancellor's comments this morning are the clearest indication that it will not happen. To be clear, it is very much a distortion. Average earnings were depressed in the pandemic by a reduction in hours worked. The official figures showed earnings were falling. From this lower base, the resumption of normality will lead to a very high number, when comparing one quarter this year to the same quarter in 2020 during lockdown. But this also reflects the design of the triple lock. As the OBR put it, ""it has no memory"". The point of the lock was, last year, to deliver a 2.5% rise in pensions this year, despite earnings being -1% and inflation being just 0.5%. The state pension was shielded from what was happening everywhere else in the economy last year. But its current design disregards that history and will lead to a compensatory bumper boost, if it is measured as in the past (growth in the quarter to July over same quarter last year), although we won't get the figures until autumn.

Most British troops have left Afghanistan - PM,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson on UK troops returning from Afghanistan: ""We are safer because of everything they did."" All British troops assigned to Nato's mission in Afghanistan are returning home and most have already left, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said. The PM said there could ""never be a perfect moment"" to withdraw, but it was ""never intended to be permanent"". More than 450 British troops have died during the conflict with the Taliban and fighters from al-Qaeda since 2001. But Britain's most senior general has warned Afghanistan could slide into civil war once foreign troops leave. The US has said it will withdraw all forces by 11 September. The US-led bombing of Afghanistan began in October 2001, following the 11 September attacks on the United States. At the height of the war, Nato had more than 130,000 troops from 50 nations in Afghanistan. The UK had 9,500 personnel and 137 bases in Helmand province alone. 20 years in Afghanistan: Was it worth it? US troops must leave by deadline - Afghan Taliban Echoes of 1989 as foreign forces leave Afghanistan In a statement to the House of Commons, Mr Johnson said after the majority of troops returned home in 2014, about 750 service personnel stayed in Afghanistan under Nato's mission to train and assist the country's security forces. ""No-one should doubt the gains of the last 20 years,"" he told MPs. ""But nor can we shrink from the hard reality of the situation today."" He said the situation in Afghanistan now is ""very different"" compared to 20 years ago when the country was ""the epicentre of global terrorism"". ""We and our Nato allies were always going to withdraw our forces,"" Mr Johnson said. ""The only question was when, and there could never be a perfect moment."" This video can not be played ""We have to live with our losses for the rest of our lives"" - mother Lucy Aldridge reflects on the loss of her son William US President Joe Biden announced in April that American troops will leave Afghanistan by 11 September,saying it was ""time to end America's longest war"". The US had some 2,500 troops in the country as part of a 9,600-strong Nato mission. That would coincide with the 20th anniversary of the terror attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon in the US in 2001. The Taliban told the BBC this month that any foreign troops left in Afghanistan after Nato's September withdrawal deadline will be at risk as occupiers. But violence in the country continues to rise, with the Taliban taking more territory. Under a deal with the militant group, the US and its Nato allies agreed to withdraw all troops in return for a commitment by the Taliban not to allow al-Qaeda or any other extremist group to operate in the areas they control. After nearly 20 years of western military support, most Nato forces have now left the country for good. That includes the majority of the 750 British troops who were in the capital Kabul to assist with security and training. The head of the Armed Forces, General Sir Nick Carter, says that those British troops who served in Afghanistan can be proud of what they achieved. But even he describes the current security situation in Afghanistan as ""pretty grim"", with the Taliban making significant advances. General Carter says it's ""plausible"" that the country might now fracture along tribal and ethnic lines. Though he still believes the Taliban will not be able to control the whole country. A total of 475 British military personnel lost their lives in the country - most killed in Helmand before combat operations ended in 2014. Their families will question whether they really leave a lasting legacy - whether their sacrifice was in vain. Boris Johnson insists that Britain is not walking away from the country. There will still be a very small British military presence in Kabul to protect diplomatic missions. But did this costly Nato mission really achieve what it set out to do? Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner said the Taliban were ""making gains on the ground"" and ""serious questions remain about the future stability of Afghanistan"". ""A security threat remains to the wider world including to the UK, and nobody wants to see British troops permanently stationed in Afghanistan, but we simply cannot wash our hands or walk away,"" she said. There had been ""moments of huge difficulty"" in the last 20 years, Ms Rayner said, but Afghanistan's current situation ""is more concerning than at any other point in many years"". ""It's hard to see a future without bloodier conflict and wider Taliban control,"" she said. Mr Johnson told MPs Britain was ""not walking away"" from Afghanistan. ""We are keeping our embassy in Kabul and we will continue to work with our friends and allies, particularly with the government of Pakistan, to try to bring a settlement, to try to ensure that the Taliban understand that there can be no military path to victory and there must be a negotiated solution,"" he said. Speaking after Mr Johnson's announcement, Head of the Armed Forces General Nick Carter said the situation in Afghanistan was ""pretty grim"", with half the country's rural districts now in the hands of the Taliban. He warned there was a danger of ""state collapse"", adding: ""That's where you would see a culture of warlord-ism, and you might see some of the important institutions, like the security forces, fracturing along ethnic, or for that matter tribal, lines."" The majority of UK troops left Afghanistan in 2014 Designated transnational terrorist group, al-Qaeda, was able to establish itself in Afghanistan, led by Osama Bin Laden, over five years from 1996-2001. It set up terrorist training camps, including experimenting with poison gas on dogs, and recruited and trained an estimated 20,000 jihadist volunteers from around the world. It also directed the twin attacks on the US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998, killing 224 people, mostly African civilians. Al-Qaeda was protected by the government at the time, the Taliban, who refused calls from the international community to expel the terror group after the 9/11 attacks in the US in September 2001. This led to the US-led bombing of Afghanistan, which began in October 2001. From 9/11, to intense fighting on the ground, and now full withdrawal of US-led forces, hereâs what happened. 11 September 2001 Al-Qaeda, led by Osama Bin Laden in Afghanistan, carries out the largest terror attack ever conducted on US soil.

Your coronavirus updates for this busy Thursday have been brought to you by Jo Couzens, Mary O'Connor, Jennifer Meierhans, Owen Amos, Alex Kleiderman and James Clarke. Our live updates on coronavirus are coming to an end soon so here's a recap on the day's news. The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned the third wave of coronavirus cases facing Africa could get worse as new and faster spreading variants drive infections. The highly transmissible Delta variant first identified in India is spreading to more and more countries. New weekly cases have now overtaken the highest weekly numbers recorded during the peak of the second wave in January this year. Meanwhile, only slightly more than 1% of the continent has been fully vaccinated. New cases have been increasing for seven weeks running and rose by an average of 28% week-on-week over the past month, according to the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The WHO says more than 251,000 new cases were recorded in the week ending 4 July, making it the ""worst pandemic week ever"". There are 23 countries on the continent that have so far experienced a third wave of infections, including Senegal and Malawi. Uganda, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Namibia, Zambia, Rwanda and Tunisia have been among the worst hit by a recent resurgence in infections. South Africa is also reporting a sustained increase in cases, with Gauteng province, where Johannesburg is located, leading with infections. You can read Reality Check's full analysis of the situationhere. Health boards in Scotland should consider cancelling non-urgent procedures to reduce pressure on hospitals, a senior public health official has said. Jillian Evans, head of health intelligence at NHS Grampian, said it would ""make sense"" to defer some operations. It comes after two hospitals reachedfull capacity in the north east. NHS Lanarkshire and NHS Highland have also reported pressure on services in recent days. And NHS Highland cancelled all non-urgent elective surgery and most outpatient activity at Inverness' Raigmore Hospital amid growing pressure. The health boards said self-isolation requirements meant that a number of staff who were double vaccinated had to stay off after being in contact with the virus outside of work. Read morehere. The latest map from the EUâs disease monitoring agency, the
ECDC, shows the EUâs new Covid hotspots: Portugal, Spain and Cyprus. Most parts of those countries have infection rates above 120
per 100,000 people, registered over the past 14 days. The more contagious Delta variant is
responsible for this, health officials say. Spainâs infection rate nationally has more than doubled in a
week, to 252 cases per 100,000. The highest rate is in the
20-29 age group, most of whom have not been vaccinated. Spain's Catalonia region has reimposed curbs on nightlife and Portugal has reintroduced night curfews. France has warned its citizens against travel to those countries. You
can see the ECDCâs latest datain full here.,external The National Education Union is calling on ministers to urgently set out the potential negative health repercussions of easing Covid restrictions in England's schools and schools this autumn. In a letter to Education Secretary Gavin Williamson, the joint general secretaries of the UK's largest teaching union, Mary Bousted and Kevin Courtney, point out that Covid infections could rise again as schools reopen in September, if the government's policy is based ""just on hope"". It comes after Williamson said the system of sending ""bubbles"" of children home after a positive casewould cease at the end of summer term. The bubble system had been necessary to limit virus spread but was now causing disruption to pupils' lives, he added. It comes as figures revealeda sharp rise in the number of pupils being sent home from school in Englanddue to Covid. The NEU's letter adds: ""We are asking these questions because we believe that should cases continue to rise, with negative health consequences in the autumn term, that you have a plan and can act quickly and decisively."" Coronavirus is continuing to spread around the world, with more than 180 million infections and four million deaths recorded across nearly 200 countries. Confirmed cases have been rising steeply since the middle of last year, but the true extent of the first outbreaks in 2020 is unclear because testing was not then widely available. Deaths have also been rising, however official figures may not fully reflect the true number in many countries. Several coronavirus vaccines have been approved for use, either by individual countries or groups of countries, such as the European Union and the World Health Organization (WHO). Some 193 countries and territories have been administering vaccines and publishing rollout data. Take a look at the charts below for more detail on the coronavirus picture around the world. As the UK passes the five million mark for coronavirus cases confirmed through a positive test the government is braced for a surge in new infections after restrictions are eased in England - likely to be on 19 July. Earlier this week Health Secretary Sajid Javid said new coronavirus cases âcould go as high as 100,000â per day, after social distancing rules end. But yesterday, the prime minister defended the government's approach to easing England's lockdown, saying the link between infection and serious disease and death has been ""severed"". Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions, Boris Johnson said: ""Currently there are only a 30th of the deaths that we were seeing at an equivalent position in previous waves of this pandemic."" The government's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance was more cautious, saying vaccines had ""weakened the link between cases and hospitalisations, but it's a weakened link, not a completely broken link"". Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, China Media Analyst Taiwanâs Central Epidemic Command Centre (CECC) has announced that from next week, a number of restrictions will be lifted as cases
of Covid-19 continue to fall. Restaurants, night markets and food courts will be allowed to open
for indoor dining from 13 July, provided they comply with CECC social
distancing guidelines,the Taiwan News website reports.,external Art galleries, museums and cinemas will also be allowed to open,
as well as most indoor and outdoor sports venues. However, visitors must comply
with local track and trace procedures,comply with social distancing and wear a mask where appropriate.,external In the past 24 hours, Taiwan has recorded18 new cases of Covid-19, and three deaths.,externalTodayâs statistics are on par with those recorded in early May, before the
islandwent into near lockdown due to a spike in cases. Taiwan has four Covid-19 response levels, with Level 4 being a
full, national lockdown. Level 3 mean all non-essential businesses are
closed and a mask-mandate is in place. These rules have been in place since 15
May in New Taipei and Taipei City, and nationally since 20 May. They will continue to be in place until at least 26 July, meaning many other venues, including schools, bars and clubs, will remain closed
until at least then. Travel bosses have cautiously welcomed the announcement that fully vaccinated travellers returning from amber-list countries will not have to self-isolate after 19 July. But EasyJet boss Johan Lundgren said he did not want to see ""a return to flying being a preserve of the rich"". ""Expensive testing could sadly make travel out of reach for some,"" he said. Airlines and airports said millions of people could have a more normal summer, but the government should do more. The need to quarantine on return had hindered a travel industry recovery. Under previous rules, those returning to Britain from its top destinations, Spain, France, the US and Italy, all had to self-isolate for up to 10 days.

Covid infection rates across all regions of England are at their highest level since at least February, according to Public Health England's latest surveillance report. The highest case rate is being seen in north-east England, with 613.4 cases per 100,000 people in the week to 4 July. It is the highest figure for the region since like for like figures began in the summer of last year, as mass testing was rolled out across the country. Meanwhile, all the other regions are seeing their highest rate since late January or early February - with the exception of Yorkshire and the Humber where the rate is the highest since mid-November last year. Today's number of new positive coronavirus tests has pushed the UK total over the course of the pandemic, by that measure, to more than five million. The UK reported 32,551 new infections in the last 24 hours, up from 32,548 yesterday when it was the first day that cases rose above 30,000 since 24 January. This means the total number of positive tests for the coronavirus in the UK, according to the government data, is 5,022,893. But in the early days of the pandemic last year when it was harder to get a test, many people would have been likely to have had the virus but not tested positive for it - so the total number of cases could never be known and may be a fair bit higher. Just over a quarter of a million coronavirus vaccinations were given in the UK yesterday - 86,953 first doses and 171,477 second jabs. The UK has now given a total of 79,800,224 coronavirus vaccinations,according to the government's daily statistics.,external That's 45,601,445 first doses and 34,198,779 second doses. The rules onforeign travelandself-isolationare soon going to change for people who have had both jabs. There have been a further 35 coronavirus-related deaths in the UK,according to the government's daily figures.,external This brings the total number of people to die within 28 days of a positive Covid test to 128,336. There were also another 32,551 new cases recorded in the past 24 hours.

Caroline DaviesTransport correspondent For the first time in a while,
travel bosses are relatively pleased. Todayâs announcement is a big change,
opening up international travel far more significantly that has been possible
this year. However, there are limitations. This policy only applies to those
jabbed in the UK, meaning those jabbed abroad will still have to quarantine if
coming from an amber list country. That will affect some family and friends
hoping to reunite and impact on businesses that rely on international visitors

about what happens when people travel to the UK - whether other countries will
let UK travellers in is a different matter altogether.

As coronavirus cases continue to rise in England, the number of exposure alerts sent to users of the NHS Covid-19 app has risen by more than 60%, according to the latest contact tracing figures. A total of 356,036 alerts were sent to users of the app in England in the week to June 30, telling them they had been in close contact with someone who had tested positive for coronavirus. This is up from 219,391 the previous week - a jump of 62% - and is the highest weekly figure since data was first published in January. Ministers have been warned that millions of people could be ""pinged"" by the app or ordered to self-isolate by Test and Trace, with infections expected to hit around 100,000 cases a day in the summer.

Your coronavirus updates for this busy Thursday have been brought to you by Jo Couzens, Mary O'Connor, Jennifer Meierhans, Owen Amos, Alex Kleiderman and James Clarke. Our live updates on coronavirus are coming to an end soon so here's a recap on the day's news. The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned the third wave of coronavirus cases facing Africa could get worse as new and faster spreading variants drive infections. The highly transmissible Delta variant first identified in India is spreading to more and more countries. New weekly cases have now overtaken the highest weekly numbers recorded during the peak of the second wave in January this year. Meanwhile, only slightly more than 1% of the continent has been fully vaccinated. New cases have been increasing for seven weeks running and rose by an average of 28% week-on-week over the past month, according to the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The WHO says more than 251,000 new cases were recorded in the week ending 4 July, making it the ""worst pandemic week ever"". There are 23 countries on the continent that have so far experienced a third wave of infections, including Senegal and Malawi. Uganda, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Namibia, Zambia, Rwanda and Tunisia have been among the worst hit by a recent resurgence in infections. South Africa is also reporting a sustained increase in cases, with Gauteng province, where Johannesburg is located, leading with infections. You can read Reality Check's full analysis of the situationhere. Health boards in Scotland should consider cancelling non-urgent procedures to reduce pressure on hospitals, a senior public health official has said. Jillian Evans, head of health intelligence at NHS Grampian, said it would ""make sense"" to defer some operations. It comes after two hospitals reachedfull capacity in the north east. NHS Lanarkshire and NHS Highland have also reported pressure on services in recent days. And NHS Highland cancelled all non-urgent elective surgery and most outpatient activity at Inverness' Raigmore Hospital amid growing pressure. The health boards said self-isolation requirements meant that a number of staff who were double vaccinated had to stay off after being in contact with the virus outside of work. Read morehere. The latest map from the EUâs disease monitoring agency, the
ECDC, shows the EUâs new Covid hotspots: Portugal, Spain and Cyprus. Most parts of those countries have infection rates above 120
per 100,000 people, registered over the past 14 days. The more contagious Delta variant is
responsible for this, health officials say. Spainâs infection rate nationally has more than doubled in a
week, to 252 cases per 100,000. The highest rate is in the
20-29 age group, most of whom have not been vaccinated. Spain's Catalonia region has reimposed curbs on nightlife and Portugal has reintroduced night curfews. France has warned its citizens against travel to those countries. You

In a letter to Education Secretary Gavin Williamson, the joint general secretaries of the UK's largest teaching union, Mary Bousted and Kevin Courtney, point out that Covid infections could rise again as schools reopen in September, if the government's policy is based ""just on hope"". It comes after Williamson said the system of sending ""bubbles"" of children home after a positive casewould cease at the end of summer term. The bubble system had been necessary to limit virus spread but was now causing disruption to pupils' lives, he added. It comes as figures revealeda sharp rise in the number of pupils being sent home from school in Englanddue to Covid. The NEU's letter adds: ""We are asking these questions because we believe that should cases continue to rise, with negative health consequences in the autumn term, that you have a plan and can act quickly and decisively."" Coronavirus is continuing to spread around the world, with more than 180 million infections and four million deaths recorded across nearly 200 countries. Confirmed cases have been rising steeply since the middle of last year, but the true extent of the first outbreaks in 2020 is unclear because testing was not then widely available. Deaths have also been rising, however official figures may not fully reflect the true number in many countries. Several coronavirus vaccines have been approved for use, either by individual countries or groups of countries, such as the European Union and the World Health Organization (WHO). Some 193 countries and territories have been administering vaccines and publishing rollout data. Take a look at the charts below for more detail on the coronavirus picture around the world. As the UK passes the five million mark for coronavirus cases confirmed through a positive test the government is braced for a surge in new infections after restrictions are eased in England - likely to be on 19 July. Earlier this week Health Secretary Sajid Javid said new coronavirus cases âcould go as high as 100,000â per day, after social distancing rules end. But yesterday, the prime minister defended the government's approach to easing England's lockdown, saying the link between infection and serious disease and death has been ""severed"". Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions, Boris Johnson said: ""Currently there are only a 30th of the deaths that we were seeing at an equivalent position in previous waves of this pandemic."" The government's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance was more cautious, saying vaccines had ""weakened the link between cases and hospitalisations, but it's a weakened link, not a completely broken link"". Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, China Media Analyst Taiwanâs Central Epidemic Command Centre (CECC) has announced that from next week, a number of restrictions will be lifted as cases
of Covid-19 continue to fall. Restaurants, night markets and food courts will be allowed to open

distancing guidelines,the Taiwan News website reports.,external Art galleries, museums and cinemas will also be allowed to open,
as well as most indoor and outdoor sports venues. However, visitors must comply

"PM's explanation for Mustique trip criticisedBut, Boris Johnson is cleared of breaching parliamentary standards rules over the Caribbean holiday.","This video can not be played The prime minister: The committee found âthere was no case to answer."" Boris Johnson has been criticised by the MPs standards watchdog for failing to promptly explain how a trip to Mustique was funded - however he has been cleared of breaching the rules. An inquiry was launched into the prime minister's 2019 Caribbean holiday after confusion over who paid for the trip. The Committee on Standards has now concluded that Mr Johnson's account was ""accurate and complete"". But, it added it was ""regrettable"" a full explanation had not come earlier. In making its judgement, the committee overruled the Commons standards commissioner Kathryn Stone who having carried out the report had concluded that Mr Johnson broke the rules by having not ""fulfilled conscientiously"" the requirements to register donations. The committee - made up of MPs and members of the public - said it reached a different conclusion after receiving additional evidence. The prime minister told reporters he hadn't seen the conclusions of the report but said ""as I understand it, the committee has found there was no case to answer."" Responding to the report, Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner said: ""The way Johnson handles his personal finances mirrors the way he governs the country - chaos and confusion."" Johnson investigated over funding of 2019 holiday Labour calls for probe into Johnson's Â£15,000 holiday What are the rules governing political donations? This report reads a bit like a weary teacher's verdict on an unruly pupil... ""I'm not angry, just disappointed,"" it might have said. Boris Johnson hasn't broken the rules but neither has he gone out of his way to comply with them. Not for the first time, the committee points out. Before he was prime minister, Mr Johnson broke parliamentary rules by not declaring his share of a property soon enough and his own standards advisor said he acted ""unwisely"" over the refurbishment of his Downing street flat. His political opponents claim it's a pattern of behaviour that makes him unsuitable to govern. But Boris Johnson has survived another brush with authority unscathed. In February 2020, Mr Johnson declared that his Â£15,000 holiday accommodation on the Caribbean island had been covered by Carphone Warehouse co-founder David Ross. Mr Ross initially said he had not paid ""any monies"" for the trip. He later clarified that he had ""facilitated"" accommodation for the prime minister. Following an investigation, the Committee on Standards concluded that Mr Ross had donated the accommodation, but added that the arrangements had been ""ad hoc and informal and do not appear to have been fully explained to Mr Johnson at the outset"". ""This matter could have been concluded many months ago if more strenuous efforts had been made to dispel the uncertainty,"" the committee said. ""It is regrettable that a full account and explanation of the funding arrangements for Mr Johnson's holiday accommodation has only come to light as a result of our own inquiries rather than at an earlier stage. ""Given that Mr Johnson was twice reprimanded by our predecessor committee in the last Parliament in the space of four months for 'an over-casual attitude towards obeying the rules of the House', we would have expected him to have gone the extra mile to ensure there was no uncertainty about the arrangements."" In May 2020, the parliamentary commissioner for standards, Kathryn Stone, undertook the investigation on behalf of the committee. She found that Mr Johnson had ""sought and was offered"" use of a villa owned by Mr Ross, a Conservative party supporter and friend of Mr Johnson. However, Mr Ross' villa was unavailable for the dates of Mr Johnson's holiday so instead another villa was found for the prime minister. The commissioner said Mr Johnson was right to name Mr Ross as a donor, but said if another person had provided funds, Mr Johnson should also have given the details of whoever funded his holiday accommodation in the first instance. Ms Stone said it had been ""unusually difficult"" to establish the facts during her investigation - which had been delayed due to the pandemic and Mr Johnson's own stay in hospital. Due to a lack of ""reliable documentary evidence"", she said she was unable to conclude whether Mr Johnson's account was accurate and complete adding ""it is not my role to provide the missing information - this remains the responsibility of the member."" However she did conclude that the prime minister had breached the code because he did not ""make sufficient inquiries"" to establish who was providing his accommodation. Boris Johnson stayed on the island of Mustique, shortly after winning the 2019 general election On receiving the commissioner's report, the committee concluded it did not have sufficient evidence to judge if the code had been broken. However after making further inquiries - including contacting the owner of the villa where Mr Johnson stayed -  it said it reached a different conclusion from the commissioner and decided that Mr Johnson had not breached the rules. The committee explained it had received confirmation from the owners of the villa where Mr Johnson stayed that they had been paid by the Mustique Company that manages the island. In turn, the committee said, Mr Ross allowed the Mustique Company to use his own villa to compensate for Mr Johnson's holiday. It therefore concluded that Mr Ross was the donor ""of a benefit in kind"" to the prime minister and that Mr Johnson's account of the donation had been accurate.

"Sturgeon: Scottish Covid surge may be levelling offNicola Sturgeon says a ""slowdown"" in infections gives her optimism that restrictions can be eased.Scotland politics","The recent surge of Covid-19 cases in Scotland may be levelling off, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said. A further 2,802 positive cases were recorded on Thursday, with Ms Sturgeon saying there was an ""apparent slowdown"" in the rise in infections. She said this gave her cause for optimism that Scotland can move to level zero of restrictions on 19 July. However she stressed that measures such as the use of face masks and physical distancing will remain for some time. The Scottish Parliament will be recalled from recess next Tuesday for Ms Sturgeon to announce whether the easing of restrictions will go ahead as planned. Live: Latest on Covid-19 in Scotland Covid in Scotland: Where are the latest cases? The 2,802 positive tests announced on Thursday represents a drop from the 3,799 logged on Wednesday. A total of 401 people are in hospital with the virus, with 38 in intensive care, while a further four deaths have been registered. Case numbers are now 1,432 lower than they were last Thursday, while the seven-day average also appears to show a slowdown in the rise of positive cases. Ms Sturgeon said there was a ""suggestion that the recent surge in cases may be to some extent levelling off now"". However, she said figures remained worryingly high and could still put pressure on the health service. She said: ""We increasingly hear talk of learning to live with the virus, which we all want to be able to do. ""It is true that we can't live a restricted way of life forever as that in itself affects our health and wellbeing, and vaccines are offering us an alternative way forward. ""However, that desire to just live with it cannot mean we simply throw caution to the wind and no longer worry at all about rising levels of infection."" The Scottish government's route map out of lockdown would see the whole of the country move tolevel zero of restrictions,externalon 19 July, before scrapping most legal curbs altogether on 9 August. A decision is to be taken on the first step on 13 July, and Ms Sturgeon said this would be based on a careful evaluation of the latest data. She added: ""I very much hope we will be able to move ahead as planned, and the apparent slowdown in case numbers gives me more cause for optimism about that than I might have had a week ago."" However, the first minister stressed that Covid ""is going to be around for some time to come"", and said this meant some curbs would have to remain. She said: ""Its important I think to remind all of us that a move to level zero does not mean the immediate end of all restrictions. ""Many of the baseline measures like face coverings, physical distancing, hand hygiene and advising on ventilation, these are going to continue to be important mitigations to protect us and others from the virus for some time yet. ""No matter what our decision is next week, there won't be an abrupt end to these basic protective measures when we do move to level zero."" Scottish Conservative MSP Craig Hoy said continuing uncertainty over what restrictions would ease and when were not helping people's business, holiday or wedding plans. And he said it was ""not good enough"" that next week's statement would come just six days before the changes are due to come into force. Ms Sturgeon said her government was currently reviewing its policy on self-isolation rules, including for workplaces and travellers, and would announce the outcome shortly. The UK government has announced that fully-vaccinated people arriving in England from amber travel list destinationswill no longer have to quarantine from 19 July. The first minister also acknowledged the growing pressure on the NHS amid high case numbers, despite a lower proportion of people requiring hospital care. Two hospitals in the north east of Scotland have reached full capacity, withcalls for non-urgent procedures to be cancelledto ease the strain on services. Hospitals are under pressure but it is different this time. Despite soaring case numbers, far fewer people are ending up in hospital with Covid. There's also some evidence that they don't need treatment for as long. But hospitals are busier now than last year when many other procedures were postponed. Health boards say the numbers of non-Covid patients they are seeing over summer is equivalent to that usually experienced in the busier winter months. Figures from Public Health Scotland show emergency departments faced their busiest ever May, with more than 112,563 attendances. Add into that fewer available beds because of distancing requirements, juggling staff leave, staff sickness and self-isolation, and the already high vacancy rates in some areas. It doesn't take much before hospitals are at full stretch. As ever, the NHS has to prioritise those most in need of treatment and that means some are already having to postpone non-urgent surgery. The major burden on the NHS during this wave may turn out not to be Covid patients themselves but the wider impacts of the whole pandemic. Chief Medical Officer Dr Gregor Smith said the remobilisation of the health service - with procedures delayed due to the pandemic now starting up again - meant hospitals were busier than normal with non-Covid work. He added: ""What I'm hearing from colleagues is much more in the way of very complex and often quite unwell people who are presenting, particularly either in community-based services or at emergency departments, with illness which necessitates hospital admission and where the length of stay is slightly longer. ""We are also seeing increased respiratory infections, particularly in younger children where we know we have an upsurge in parainfluezna, a type of viral infection, and that is having an knock on effect on people presenting to GPs and emergency departments with unwell children.""

PM's explanation for Mustique trip criticised,"This video can not be played The prime minister: The committee found âthere was no case to answer."" Boris Johnson has been criticised by the MPs standards watchdog for failing to promptly explain how a trip to Mustique was funded - however he has been cleared of breaching the rules. An inquiry was launched into the prime minister's 2019 Caribbean holiday after confusion over who paid for the trip. The Committee on Standards has now concluded that Mr Johnson's account was ""accurate and complete"". But, it added it was ""regrettable"" a full explanation had not come earlier. In making its judgement, the committee overruled the Commons standards commissioner Kathryn Stone who having carried out the report had concluded that Mr Johnson broke the rules by having not ""fulfilled conscientiously"" the requirements to register donations. The committee - made up of MPs and members of the public - said it reached a different conclusion after receiving additional evidence. The prime minister told reporters he hadn't seen the conclusions of the report but said ""as I understand it, the committee has found there was no case to answer."" Responding to the report, Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner said: ""The way Johnson handles his personal finances mirrors the way he governs the country - chaos and confusion."" Johnson investigated over funding of 2019 holiday Labour calls for probe into Johnson's Â£15,000 holiday What are the rules governing political donations? This report reads a bit like a weary teacher's verdict on an unruly pupil... ""I'm not angry, just disappointed,"" it might have said. Boris Johnson hasn't broken the rules but neither has he gone out of his way to comply with them. Not for the first time, the committee points out. Before he was prime minister, Mr Johnson broke parliamentary rules by not declaring his share of a property soon enough and his own standards advisor said he acted ""unwisely"" over the refurbishment of his Downing street flat. His political opponents claim it's a pattern of behaviour that makes him unsuitable to govern. But Boris Johnson has survived another brush with authority unscathed. In February 2020, Mr Johnson declared that his Â£15,000 holiday accommodation on the Caribbean island had been covered by Carphone Warehouse co-founder David Ross. Mr Ross initially said he had not paid ""any monies"" for the trip. He later clarified that he had ""facilitated"" accommodation for the prime minister. Following an investigation, the Committee on Standards concluded that Mr Ross had donated the accommodation, but added that the arrangements had been ""ad hoc and informal and do not appear to have been fully explained to Mr Johnson at the outset"". ""This matter could have been concluded many months ago if more strenuous efforts had been made to dispel the uncertainty,"" the committee said. ""It is regrettable that a full account and explanation of the funding arrangements for Mr Johnson's holiday accommodation has only come to light as a result of our own inquiries rather than at an earlier stage. ""Given that Mr Johnson was twice reprimanded by our predecessor committee in the last Parliament in the space of four months for 'an over-casual attitude towards obeying the rules of the House', we would have expected him to have gone the extra mile to ensure there was no uncertainty about the arrangements."" In May 2020, the parliamentary commissioner for standards, Kathryn Stone, undertook the investigation on behalf of the committee. She found that Mr Johnson had ""sought and was offered"" use of a villa owned by Mr Ross, a Conservative party supporter and friend of Mr Johnson. However, Mr Ross' villa was unavailable for the dates of Mr Johnson's holiday so instead another villa was found for the prime minister. The commissioner said Mr Johnson was right to name Mr Ross as a donor, but said if another person had provided funds, Mr Johnson should also have given the details of whoever funded his holiday accommodation in the first instance. Ms Stone said it had been ""unusually difficult"" to establish the facts during her investigation - which had been delayed due to the pandemic and Mr Johnson's own stay in hospital. Due to a lack of ""reliable documentary evidence"", she said she was unable to conclude whether Mr Johnson's account was accurate and complete adding ""it is not my role to provide the missing information - this remains the responsibility of the member."" However she did conclude that the prime minister had breached the code because he did not ""make sufficient inquiries"" to establish who was providing his accommodation. Boris Johnson stayed on the island of Mustique, shortly after winning the 2019 general election On receiving the commissioner's report, the committee concluded it did not have sufficient evidence to judge if the code had been broken. However after making further inquiries - including contacting the owner of the villa where Mr Johnson stayed -  it said it reached a different conclusion from the commissioner and decided that Mr Johnson had not breached the rules. The committee explained it had received confirmation from the owners of the villa where Mr Johnson stayed that they had been paid by the Mustique Company that manages the island. In turn, the committee said, Mr Ross allowed the Mustique Company to use his own villa to compensate for Mr Johnson's holiday. It therefore concluded that Mr Ross was the donor ""of a benefit in kind"" to the prime minister and that Mr Johnson's account of the donation had been accurate.

What are the rules on travel?,"Foreign travel is now easier for people in the UK than at any time since the beginning of the pandemic. However, there are still regulations about who can enter most countries, restrictions on what you can do when you get there, and rules to follow when you return home. These can change quickly, so it's important to keep checking theForeign Office guidance,externaland tourist information for your destination before you go. Here are some key things to know about travelling to popular destinations.

Your coronavirus updates for this busy Thursday have been brought to you by Jo Couzens, Mary O'Connor, Jennifer Meierhans, Owen Amos, Alex Kleiderman and James Clarke. Our live updates on coronavirus are coming to an end soon so here's a recap on the day's news. The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned the third wave of coronavirus cases facing Africa could get worse as new and faster spreading variants drive infections. The highly transmissible Delta variant first identified in India is spreading to more and more countries. New weekly cases have now overtaken the highest weekly numbers recorded during the peak of the second wave in January this year. Meanwhile, only slightly more than 1% of the continent has been fully vaccinated. New cases have been increasing for seven weeks running and rose by an average of 28% week-on-week over the past month, according to the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The WHO says more than 251,000 new cases were recorded in the week ending 4 July, making it the ""worst pandemic week ever"". There are 23 countries on the continent that have so far experienced a third wave of infections, including Senegal and Malawi. Uganda, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Namibia, Zambia, Rwanda and Tunisia have been among the worst hit by a recent resurgence in infections. South Africa is also reporting a sustained increase in cases, with Gauteng province, where Johannesburg is located, leading with infections. You can read Reality Check's full analysis of the situationhere. Health boards in Scotland should consider cancelling non-urgent procedures to reduce pressure on hospitals, a senior public health official has said. Jillian Evans, head of health intelligence at NHS Grampian, said it would ""make sense"" to defer some operations. It comes after two hospitals reachedfull capacity in the north east. NHS Lanarkshire and NHS Highland have also reported pressure on services in recent days. And NHS Highland cancelled all non-urgent elective surgery and most outpatient activity at Inverness' Raigmore Hospital amid growing pressure. The health boards said self-isolation requirements meant that a number of staff who were double vaccinated had to stay off after being in contact with the virus outside of work. Read morehere. The latest map from the EUâs disease monitoring agency, the
ECDC, shows the EUâs new Covid hotspots: Portugal, Spain and Cyprus. Most parts of those countries have infection rates above 120
per 100,000 people, registered over the past 14 days. The more contagious Delta variant is
responsible for this, health officials say. Spainâs infection rate nationally has more than doubled in a
week, to 252 cases per 100,000. The highest rate is in the
20-29 age group, most of whom have not been vaccinated. Spain's Catalonia region has reimposed curbs on nightlife and Portugal has reintroduced night curfews. France has warned its citizens against travel to those countries. You

In a letter to Education Secretary Gavin Williamson, the joint general secretaries of the UK's largest teaching union, Mary Bousted and Kevin Courtney, point out that Covid infections could rise again as schools reopen in September, if the government's policy is based ""just on hope"". It comes after Williamson said the system of sending ""bubbles"" of children home after a positive casewould cease at the end of summer term. The bubble system had been necessary to limit virus spread but was now causing disruption to pupils' lives, he added. It comes as figures revealeda sharp rise in the number of pupils being sent home from school in Englanddue to Covid. The NEU's letter adds: ""We are asking these questions because we believe that should cases continue to rise, with negative health consequences in the autumn term, that you have a plan and can act quickly and decisively."" Coronavirus is continuing to spread around the world, with more than 180 million infections and four million deaths recorded across nearly 200 countries. Confirmed cases have been rising steeply since the middle of last year, but the true extent of the first outbreaks in 2020 is unclear because testing was not then widely available. Deaths have also been rising, however official figures may not fully reflect the true number in many countries. Several coronavirus vaccines have been approved for use, either by individual countries or groups of countries, such as the European Union and the World Health Organization (WHO). Some 193 countries and territories have been administering vaccines and publishing rollout data. Take a look at the charts below for more detail on the coronavirus picture around the world. As the UK passes the five million mark for coronavirus cases confirmed through a positive test the government is braced for a surge in new infections after restrictions are eased in England - likely to be on 19 July. Earlier this week Health Secretary Sajid Javid said new coronavirus cases âcould go as high as 100,000â per day, after social distancing rules end. But yesterday, the prime minister defended the government's approach to easing England's lockdown, saying the link between infection and serious disease and death has been ""severed"". Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions, Boris Johnson said: ""Currently there are only a 30th of the deaths that we were seeing at an equivalent position in previous waves of this pandemic."" The government's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance was more cautious, saying vaccines had ""weakened the link between cases and hospitalisations, but it's a weakened link, not a completely broken link"". Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, China Media Analyst Taiwanâs Central Epidemic Command Centre (CECC) has announced that from next week, a number of restrictions will be lifted as cases
of Covid-19 continue to fall. Restaurants, night markets and food courts will be allowed to open
for indoor dining from 13 July, provided they comply with CECC social
distancing guidelines,the Taiwan News website reports.,external Art galleries, museums and cinemas will also be allowed to open,
as well as most indoor and outdoor sports venues. However, visitors must comply
with local track and trace procedures,comply with social distancing and wear a mask where appropriate.,external In the past 24 hours, Taiwan has recorded18 new cases of Covid-19, and three deaths.,externalTodayâs statistics are on par with those recorded in early May, before the
islandwent into near lockdown due to a spike in cases. Taiwan has four Covid-19 response levels, with Level 4 being a
full, national lockdown. Level 3 mean all non-essential businesses are
closed and a mask-mandate is in place. These rules have been in place since 15
May in New Taipei and Taipei City, and nationally since 20 May. They will continue to be in place until at least 26 July, meaning many other venues, including schools, bars and clubs, will remain closed
until at least then. Travel bosses have cautiously welcomed the announcement that fully vaccinated travellers returning from amber-list countries will not have to self-isolate after 19 July. But EasyJet boss Johan Lundgren said he did not want to see ""a return to flying being a preserve of the rich"". ""Expensive testing could sadly make travel out of reach for some,"" he said. Airlines and airports said millions of people could have a more normal summer, but the government should do more. The need to quarantine on return had hindered a travel industry recovery. Under previous rules, those returning to Britain from its top destinations, Spain, France, the US and Italy, all had to self-isolate for up to 10 days. Read the full story and more industry reactionhere. Covid infection rates across all regions of England are at their highest level since at least February, according to Public Health England's latest surveillance report. The highest case rate is being seen in north-east England, with 613.4 cases per 100,000 people in the week to 4 July. It is the highest figure for the region since like for like figures began in the summer of last year, as mass testing was rolled out across the country. Meanwhile, all the other regions are seeing their highest rate since late January or early February - with the exception of Yorkshire and the Humber where the rate is the highest since mid-November last year. Today's number of new positive coronavirus tests has pushed the UK total over the course of the pandemic, by that measure, to more than five million. The UK reported 32,551 new infections in the last 24 hours, up from 32,548 yesterday when it was the first day that cases rose above 30,000 since 24 January. This means the total number of positive tests for the coronavirus in the UK, according to the government data, is 5,022,893. But in the early days of the pandemic last year when it was harder to get a test, many people would have been likely to have had the virus but not tested positive for it - so the total number of cases could never be known and may be a fair bit higher. Just over a quarter of a million coronavirus vaccinations were given in the UK yesterday - 86,953 first doses and 171,477 second jabs. The UK has now given a total of 79,800,224 coronavirus vaccinations,according to the government's daily statistics.,external That's 45,601,445 first doses and 34,198,779 second doses. The rules onforeign travelandself-isolationare soon going to change for people who have had both jabs. There have been a further 35 coronavirus-related deaths in the UK,according to the government's daily figures.,external This brings the total number of people to die within 28 days of a positive Covid test to 128,336. There were also another 32,551 new cases recorded in the past 24 hours. The Shearwater field is east of Aberdeen More than 80 people have been flown ashore from a North Sea oil and gas platform following a Covid outbreak. Fifteen positive cases have been identified on the Safe Zephyrus floating hotel next to the Shell-owned Shearwater platform in the past week. Shell says those who tested positive along with 70 identified close contacts have been removed from the facility, 140 miles (225km) east of Aberdeen.

Caroline DaviesTransport correspondent For the first time in a while,
travel bosses are relatively pleased. Todayâs announcement is a big change,
opening up international travel far more significantly that has been possible
this year. However, there are limitations. This policy only applies to those
jabbed in the UK, meaning those jabbed abroad will still have to quarantine if
coming from an amber list country. That will affect some family and friends
hoping to reunite and impact on businesses that rely on international visitors
who wonât see those customers return in the same numbers as UK travellers will
leave. Tests are still required from
green and amber list countries. The cost will dissuade some from travelling. Crucially, this rule is just
about what happens when people travel to the UK - whether other countries will
let UK travellers in is a different matter altogether. Earlier, we reported that Japan had declared a state of emergency in Tokyo to combat coronavirus - measures that will be in place during the Olympic Games later this month. We've since got more detail on what that will mean, with Olympics Minister Tamayo Marukawa announcing the Games will happen without spectators following discussions today with officials and organisers. Bars and restaurants will not be allowed to serve alcohol and must close by 20:00 (11:00 GMT). After meeting government officials, Tokyo 2020 President Seiko Hashimoto says: ""It is regrettable that we are delivering the Games in a very limited format, facing the spread of coronavirus infections. ""I am sorry to those who purchased tickets and everyone in local areas."" The Olympic Games are scheduled to take place in the Japanese capital between 23 July and 8 August. There has been widespread opposition to the Games in Japan, with calls for them to be postponed or cancelled. You can read morehere. Today's announcement on travel ""finally signals"" a meaningful restart to international travels and is the news that UK holidaymakers have been looking forward to, says Jet2's boss. Chief executive Steve Heapy says: ""Instead of a handful of destinations to choose from, this news means our customers can plan and look forward to flights and holidays across 40 green and amber list destinations this summer."" He says: ""With the government looking to unlock restrictions from 19 July, we have been calling for international travel not to be left behind, so this is an extremely positive step forward for the travel industry."" Heapy looks forward to the Scottish and Northern Ireland governments ""following suit"", he says. Meanwhile, the UK Chamber of Shipping Chief Executive Bob Sanguinetti says: âMillions of people enjoy travelling by ferry and we are pleased to see that entry restrictions are being eased for UK nationals who have been fully vaccinated. ""This is a positive step in the right direction and this decision will benefit our ferry members and their passengers who can now book their travel with much greater confidence.""

As coronavirus cases continue to rise in England, the number of exposure alerts sent to users of the NHS Covid-19 app has risen by more than 60%, according to the latest contact tracing figures. A total of 356,036 alerts were sent to users of the app in England in the week to June 30, telling them they had been in close contact with someone who had tested positive for coronavirus. This is up from 219,391 the previous week - a jump of 62% - and is the highest weekly figure since data was first published in January. Ministers have been warned that millions of people could be ""pinged"" by the app or ordered to self-isolate by Test and Trace, with infections expected to hit around 100,000 cases a day in the summer. Earlier, Chancellor Rishi Sunak had acknowledged public ""frustration"" and said that Health Secretary Sajid Javid is looking at an ""appropriate, balanced and proportionate"" approach for the app. Read more:Millions could be self-isolating between now and 16 August Heathrow Airport boss John Holland-Kaye has welcomed the change in rules for UK residents returning from amber-list countries - but says the ""job isn't done"".

Holland-Kaye says ""Global Britain needs to get trading again"", adding: ""US business can get to the EU, but the UK remains cut off."" The airport's chief executive says the UK should open up travel to fully-vaccinated people from more countries - particularly key partners in the US - by the end of July, adding: ""If the EU can do it, so can the UK.""

Amber list quarantine for fully vaccinated to endThe exemption will apply to vaccinated UK residents and under-18s arriving in England from 19 July.,"This video can not be played Grant Shapps announces changes to quarantine rules for the fully vaccinated Fully vaccinated UK residents arriving in England from amber travel list destinations will no longer have to quarantine from 19 July. However, they will still need to pay for Covid tests before and after their return, the transport secretary said. Grant Shapps told MPs that under-18s returning from amber list places would also be exempt from quarantine. Travel industry leaders said the change was a ""positive step"" but called for the amber list to be expanded. Currently, anyone returning from countries on the amber or red list must isolate for 10 days, regardless of vaccine status. Mr Shapps said a full vaccination means ""14 days have passed since your final dose of the vaccine"" - and only vaccines given by the NHS will count. But he said officials were ""working to extend our approach to vaccinated passengers from important markets and holiday destinations, later this summer, such as the United States and the EU"". Northern Ireland plans to adopt the changefrom 26 July, while both Scotland andWales have said they will considerwhether to follow the same rules. How can I prove I've had both my Covid jabs? Job not done on holiday rules, say travel chiefs What are the travel rules for people with both jabs? Under the change, fully-jabbed people travelling from amber list countries will still be required to take a test three days before they return and on the second day after they are back - but they will now be exempted from a day eight test. Mr Shapps told MPs: ""In essence, this means that for fully vaccinated travellers the requirements for green and amber list countries are the same."" He also said that, from 19 July - the daywhen most Covid rules in England are due to end- the guidance that people should not travel to amber list countries will be removed. But he cautioned that ""an amber list country could still turn red"", meaning hotel quarantine would become a requirement. All of England's 19 July rule changes are due to be confirmed on 12 July after a review of the latest data. Heathrow Airport welcomed the news, but called for the rules to be eased even further Fewer than 30 destinations are on the green list - meaning travellers do not have to self-isolate when they get back to the UK, while more than 50 countries are on the strictest red list, which requires arrivals to pay to self-isolate in a hotel. But most places - including holiday hotspots such as mainland Spain, Greece and the US - are on the amber list. The next review of the countries on the green, red and amber lists will take place on 15 July. Speaking later, the transport secretary told the BBC: ""We had the choice of simply saying people would never be able to travel until every single last person had been vaccinated - or at least starting to open things up."" Mr Shapps said testing was ""important to keep people safe"" and prevent variants arriving in the UK, but denied the requirements would continue to price-out many families. On Thursday evening, thegovernment website was listing nearly 400 providers,externalcarrying out the tests fully vaccinated travellers would need to take on their return. Prices begin at Â£2.49, with the majority in the Â£50-Â£100 range. The Foreign Office, which issues travel advice that is independent from the government's traffic light system and could affect travel insurance, is stressing that not all amber countries will be approved for international travel on 19 July. However, it has updated its approved list and it now has several amber list countries including France, Greece, Morocco, Switzerland, the US, Jamaica and mainland Spain. For the first time in a while, travel bosses are relatively pleased. Today's announcement is a big change, opening up international travel far more significantly that has been possible this year. However, there are limitations. This policy only applies to those jabbed in the UK, meaning those jabbed abroad will still have to quarantine if coming from an amber list country. That will affect some family and friends hoping to reunite and impact on businesses that rely on international visitors who won't see those customers return in the same numbers as UK travellers will leave. Tests are still required from green and amber list countries. The cost will dissuade some from travelling. Crucially, this rule is just about what happens when people travel to the UK. Whether other countries will let UK travellers in is a different matter altogether. Tim Alderslade, chief executive of Airlines UK, the industry body representing UK-registered carriers, said the rule change was a ""positive move towards the genuine reopening the sector has been looking for"". John Holland-Kaye, chief executive of Heathrow, welcomed the change but said: ""The UK should open up travel to fully vaccinated people from more countries - particularly our key partners in the US - by the end of July."" However, MP Caroline Lucas - vice-chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Coronavirus, said the government was ""in danger of repeating the same mistakes that allowed the Delta variant to take root in the UK"". Katherine Wood, a post-doctoral researcher at the University of Oxford, will not get a second jab until the end of August and told the BBC the government changes were frustrating for young people who had already sacrificed a ""huge amount"" during the pandemic. The 26-year-old said: ""They should have waited until the vast majority of people, particularly young people, had been double-vaccinated before changing any rules because I really feel quite disenfranchised by what's happened."" The traffic light system sets the rules travellers must follow on their return. But holidaymakers also need tocheck their destination's entry rules. For example, all non-vaccinated travellers to mainlandPortugalneed a negative Covid test, and must quarantine for 14 days. Twelve to 17-year-olds travelling with fully vaccinated parents don't have to quarantine but need a negative test. Under-11s are exempt. Only fully vaccinated adults can travel toMalta, and do not need a negative test. Children aged five to 11 can travel with fully vaccinated adults, but need a negative test. Under-fives don't need a test. Unvaccinated 12 to 17-year olds can't enter. Over-12s travelling toSpainneed a negative test or proof of vaccination. Unvaccinated travellers can only enterFrancefor ""essential reasons"", and must self-isolate for seven days. Fully-vaccinated adults with a negative test can enter. Under-18s travelling with fully vaccinated adults don't need to self-isolate. Earlier, Chancellor Rishi Sunak told the BBC that in addition to relaxing the rules around isolation for travellers, the government was considering a ""more proportionate and balanced approach"" to isolation for Covid contacts. It comes amid fears that surging cases will lead to millions of people being asked to self-isolate during the summer, even if they have been fully vaccinated. The requirement for double-jabbed people to isolate after contact with a positive case is due to end on 16 August, four weeks after the majority of England's Covid rules are set to end, to allow more people to be vaccinated. Mr Sunak acknowledged there was ""frustration"" at how theNHS contact tracing appcould continue to order the double jabbed to isolate. Dr Jenny Harries, head of the UK Health Security Agency, urged people to continue using the app - saying it had helped to detect about 500,000 cases to date - but told the Commons Public Accounts Committee work was being done to ""tune"" it to operate within the vaccinated population so it was there ""for a purpose, not for annoyance"". Nearly 65% of the adult population in the UK have received two jabs, and 86% have had a first dose. A total of 32,551 new UK coronavirus caseswere announced on Thursday,external- up very slightly on Wednesday and taking the total number of positive tests in the pandemic above five million. There were also 35 more deaths. DOING RANDOM ACTS OF KINDNESS:What happens when we're kind to strangers? ""MY DISABILITY WAS A FACTOR"":Why are disabled women more likely to be harassed?

Ministers consider easing more Covid-19 rules,"The Stormont executive agreed 26 July as an indicative date for easing quarantine rules From 26 July, fully vaccinated people returning to Northern Ireland from so-called amber countries will not have to quarantine under new indicative dates agreed by the executive for lifting Covid restrictions. Stormont ministers agreed the changes when they met on Thursday. They also agreed that theatres are to be allowed to reopen on 26 July. The requirement for face coverings to be worn in places of worship could also be removed then. However, most proposals will need to be ratified at an executive meeting on 22 July. What can I do as NI's Covid restrictions ease? The plans agreed at Thursday's executive meeting mean that Northern Ireland will not directly follow the approach Prime Minister Boris Johnson has outlined for England. He has said masks will no longer be required and social distancing rules will be scrapped for England at the final stage of his government's plan, due to take effect on 19 July. The plan to end the mandatory wearing of masks in England on 19 July will not be replicated in Northern Ireland Stormont ministers have agreed to make the following changes on 26 July, subject to health advice: the reopening of theatres and indoor seated venues for performances - with mitigations including entry only by tickets bought ahead of an event the return of conferences and exhibitions live music indoors with no restrictions on sound levels 10 people from three households to meet indoors in a private home 15 people from any number of households to meet in a private garden remove the ""linked households/bubble"" provision close contact services to operate without appointments reduce the legal requirement for social distancing to 1m indoors and remove it for all outdoor activities - instead keeping social distancing guidance to advise 1m if possible for all activities indoors and outdoors remove some restrictions in MoT centres to make it easier for examiners to carry out vehicle tests It is understood ministers also agreed to consider removing the guidelines for students to wear face coverings in classrooms and school ""bubbles"" but that, along with other measures, would be subject to public health conditions on 22 July. It is understood the executive has agreed to give consideration to the full return of live music and dancing without mitigations later in August. The BBC understands ministers will at that stage, also look at lifting remaining restrictions on mandatory use of face coverings, as well as the removal of social distancing and isolating. The government's Transport Secretary Grant Shapps hasset out his plans for England. From 19 July, fully vaccinated adults there will not need to isolate from amber list countries.

It is believed all of the measures would still need to be rubber stamped closer to the time at an executive meeting on 22 July. Theatres and some other audience venues have been closed or had to restrict numbers throughout the  pandemic because of social-distancing guidance. Johnson's Covid-easing plan reckless, says O'Neill NI public urged to keep wearing masks They had previously been given an indicative date of 21 June for their reopening but the executive has so far delayed that. Jimmy Fay of the Lyric Theatre in Belfast said on Thursday that the vaccination programme had been ""such a success that we need to look at a date, preferably in September, when we can remove all social distancing in theatres"". Some other indoor entertainment venues such as cinemas have been allowed to resume trading. Speaking after the executive meeting, First Minister Paul Givan said ministers from his party - the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) - believed more progress could be made ""at a faster pace"". ""We believe that is backed up by all of the data, the scientific evidence, the impact on our economy and the impact on family and wider society,"" said Mr Givan. The minister said the executive had received a ""very positive report"" about a falling number of Covid-19-related deaths, but that other ministers decided they wanted to ""move forward at a slower pace"". Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said the executive had taken a ""cautious"" and ""steady"" approach, which she believed was the ""right one"". She said ""the Boris Johnson approach"" to easing restrictions was reckless. ""Based on our own information and our own data we have taken decisions today that demonstrates progress, demonstrates that we're able to continue to make some easements,"" said Ms O'Neill. Earlier Sir Michael McBride, Northern Ireland's chief medical officer, has expressed concern about mixed messages on issues such as masks. This video can not be played Concern over public messaging 'inconsistencies' around face masks ""It's important that we guard against sending the public mixed messages about the evidence around matters such as face coverings and the benefit of face coverings,"" he said. ""Whether those are mandatory or whether those are voluntary, those are policy matters and ultimately a matter for ministers.""

"Most British troops have left Afghanistan - PMThere could ""never be a perfect moment"" to withdraw from the country, Boris Johnson tells MPs.","This video can not be played Boris Johnson on UK troops returning from Afghanistan: ""We are safer because of everything they did."" All British troops assigned to Nato's mission in Afghanistan are returning home and most have already left, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said. The PM said there could ""never be a perfect moment"" to withdraw, but it was ""never intended to be permanent"". More than 450 British troops have died during the conflict with the Taliban and fighters from al-Qaeda since 2001. But Britain's most senior general has warned Afghanistan could slide into civil war once foreign troops leave. The US has said it will withdraw all forces by 11 September. The US-led bombing of Afghanistan began in October 2001, following the 11 September attacks on the United States. At the height of the war, Nato had more than 130,000 troops from 50 nations in Afghanistan. The UK had 9,500 personnel and 137 bases in Helmand province alone. 20 years in Afghanistan: Was it worth it? US troops must leave by deadline - Afghan Taliban Echoes of 1989 as foreign forces leave Afghanistan In a statement to the House of Commons, Mr Johnson said after the majority of troops returned home in 2014, about 750 service personnel stayed in Afghanistan under Nato's mission to train and assist the country's security forces. ""No-one should doubt the gains of the last 20 years,"" he told MPs. ""But nor can we shrink from the hard reality of the situation today."" He said the situation in Afghanistan now is ""very different"" compared to 20 years ago when the country was ""the epicentre of global terrorism"". ""We and our Nato allies were always going to withdraw our forces,"" Mr Johnson said. ""The only question was when, and there could never be a perfect moment."" This video can not be played ""We have to live with our losses for the rest of our lives"" - mother Lucy Aldridge reflects on the loss of her son William US President Joe Biden announced in April that American troops will leave Afghanistan by 11 September,saying it was ""time to end America's longest war"". The US had some 2,500 troops in the country as part of a 9,600-strong Nato mission. That would coincide with the 20th anniversary of the terror attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon in the US in 2001. The Taliban told the BBC this month that any foreign troops left in Afghanistan after Nato's September withdrawal deadline will be at risk as occupiers. But violence in the country continues to rise, with the Taliban taking more territory. Under a deal with the militant group, the US and its Nato allies agreed to withdraw all troops in return for a commitment by the Taliban not to allow al-Qaeda or any other extremist group to operate in the areas they control. After nearly 20 years of western military support, most Nato forces have now left the country for good. That includes the majority of the 750 British troops who were in the capital Kabul to assist with security and training. The head of the Armed Forces, General Sir Nick Carter, says that those British troops who served in Afghanistan can be proud of what they achieved. But even he describes the current security situation in Afghanistan as ""pretty grim"", with the Taliban making significant advances. General Carter says it's ""plausible"" that the country might now fracture along tribal and ethnic lines. Though he still believes the Taliban will not be able to control the whole country. A total of 475 British military personnel lost their lives in the country - most killed in Helmand before combat operations ended in 2014. Their families will question whether they really leave a lasting legacy - whether their sacrifice was in vain. Boris Johnson insists that Britain is not walking away from the country. There will still be a very small British military presence in Kabul to protect diplomatic missions. But did this costly Nato mission really achieve what it set out to do? Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner said the Taliban were ""making gains on the ground"" and ""serious questions remain about the future stability of Afghanistan"". ""A security threat remains to the wider world including to the UK, and nobody wants to see British troops permanently stationed in Afghanistan, but we simply cannot wash our hands or walk away,"" she said. There had been ""moments of huge difficulty"" in the last 20 years, Ms Rayner said, but Afghanistan's current situation ""is more concerning than at any other point in many years"". ""It's hard to see a future without bloodier conflict and wider Taliban control,"" she said. Mr Johnson told MPs Britain was ""not walking away"" from Afghanistan. ""We are keeping our embassy in Kabul and we will continue to work with our friends and allies, particularly with the government of Pakistan, to try to bring a settlement, to try to ensure that the Taliban understand that there can be no military path to victory and there must be a negotiated solution,"" he said. Speaking after Mr Johnson's announcement, Head of the Armed Forces General Nick Carter said the situation in Afghanistan was ""pretty grim"", with half the country's rural districts now in the hands of the Taliban. He warned there was a danger of ""state collapse"", adding: ""That's where you would see a culture of warlord-ism, and you might see some of the important institutions, like the security forces, fracturing along ethnic, or for that matter tribal, lines."" The majority of UK troops left Afghanistan in 2014 Designated transnational terrorist group, al-Qaeda, was able to establish itself in Afghanistan, led by Osama Bin Laden, over five years from 1996-2001. It set up terrorist training camps, including experimenting with poison gas on dogs, and recruited and trained an estimated 20,000 jihadist volunteers from around the world. It also directed the twin attacks on the US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998, killing 224 people, mostly African civilians. Al-Qaeda was protected by the government at the time, the Taliban, who refused calls from the international community to expel the terror group after the 9/11 attacks in the US in September 2001. This led to the US-led bombing of Afghanistan, which began in October 2001. From 9/11, to intense fighting on the ground, and now full withdrawal of US-led forces, hereâs what happened. 11 September 2001 Al-Qaeda, led by Osama Bin Laden in Afghanistan, carries out the largest terror attack ever conducted on US soil. Four commercial airliners are hijacked. Two are flown into the World Trade Centre in New York, which collapses. One hits the Pentagon building in Washington, and one crashes into a field in Pennsylvania. Nearly 3,000 people are killed. 7 October 2001 A US-led coalition bombs Taliban and al-Qaeda facilities in Afghanistan. Targets include Kabul, Kandahar and Jalalabad. The Taliban, who took power after a decade-long Soviet occupation was followed by civil war, refuse to hand over Bin Laden. Their air defences and small fleet of fighter aircraft are destroyed. 13 November 2001 The Northern Alliance, a group of anti-Taliban rebels backed by coalition forces, enters Kabul as the Taliban flee the city. By the 13 November 2001, all Taliban have either fled or been neutralised. Other cities quickly fall. 26 January 2004 After protracted negotiations at a “loya jirga” or grand assembly, the new Afghan constitution is signed into law. The constitution paves the way for presidential elections in October 2004. 7 December 2004 Hamid Karzai, the leader of the Popalzai Durrani tribe, becomes the first president under the new constitution. He serves two five-year terms as president. May 2006 British troops arrive in Helmand province, a Taliban stronghold in the south of the country. Their initial mission is to support reconstruction projects, but they are quickly drawn into combat operations. More than 450 British troops lose their lives in Afghanistan over the course of the conflict. 17 February 2009 US President Barack Obama approves a major increase in the number of troops sent to Afghanistan. At their peak, they number about 140,000. The so-called “surge” is modelled on US strategy in Iraq where US forces focussed on protecting the civilian population as well as killing insurgent fighters. 2 May 2011 The leader of al-Qaeda is killed in an assault by US Navy Seals on a compound in Abbottabad in Pakistan. Bin Ladenâs body is removed and buried at sea. The operation ends a 10-year hunt led by the CIA. Â The confirmation that Bin Laden had been living on Pakistani soil fuels accusations in the US that Pakistan is an unreliable ally in the war on terror. 23 April 2013 The founder of the Taliban, Mullah Mohammed Omar, dies. His death is kept secret for more than two years. According to Afghan intelligence, Mullah Omar dies of health problems at a hospital in the Pakistani city of Karachi. Pakistan denies that he was in the country. 28 December 2014 At a ceremony in Kabul, Nato ends its combat operations in Afghanistan. With the surge now over, the US withdraws thousands of troops. Â Most of those who remain focus on training and supporting the Afghan security forces. 2015 The Taliban launch a series of suicide attacks, car bombings and other assaults. The parliament building in Kabul, and the city of Kunduz are attacked. Islamic State militants begin operations in Afghanistan. 25 January 2019 Afghan President Ashraf Ghani says more than 45,000 members of his countryâs security forces have been killed since he became leader in 2014. The figure is far higher than previously thought. 29 February 2020 The US and the Taliban sign an “agreement for bringing peace” to Afghanistan, in Doha, Qatar. The US and Nato allies agree to withdraw all troops within 14 months if the militants uphold the deal. 13 April 2021 US president Joe Biden announces that all US troops will leave Afghanistan by 11 September 2021. 16 August 2021 In just over a month, the Taliban sweep across Afghanistan, taking control of towns and cities all over the country, including Kabul.

"Most British troops have left Afghanistan - PMThere could ""never be a perfect moment"" to withdraw from the country, Boris Johnson tells MPs.UK","This video can not be played Boris Johnson on UK troops returning from Afghanistan: ""We are safer because of everything they did."" All British troops assigned to Nato's mission in Afghanistan are returning home and most have already left, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said. The PM said there could ""never be a perfect moment"" to withdraw, but it was ""never intended to be permanent"". More than 450 British troops have died during the conflict with the Taliban and fighters from al-Qaeda since 2001. But Britain's most senior general has warned Afghanistan could slide into civil war once foreign troops leave. The US has said it will withdraw all forces by 11 September. The US-led bombing of Afghanistan began in October 2001, following the 11 September attacks on the United States. At the height of the war, Nato had more than 130,000 troops from 50 nations in Afghanistan. The UK had 9,500 personnel and 137 bases in Helmand province alone. 20 years in Afghanistan: Was it worth it? US troops must leave by deadline - Afghan Taliban Echoes of 1989 as foreign forces leave Afghanistan In a statement to the House of Commons, Mr Johnson said after the majority of troops returned home in 2014, about 750 service personnel stayed in Afghanistan under Nato's mission to train and assist the country's security forces. ""No-one should doubt the gains of the last 20 years,"" he told MPs. ""But nor can we shrink from the hard reality of the situation today."" He said the situation in Afghanistan now is ""very different"" compared to 20 years ago when the country was ""the epicentre of global terrorism"". ""We and our Nato allies were always going to withdraw our forces,"" Mr Johnson said. ""The only question was when, and there could never be a perfect moment."" This video can not be played ""We have to live with our losses for the rest of our lives"" - mother Lucy Aldridge reflects on the loss of her son William US President Joe Biden announced in April that American troops will leave Afghanistan by 11 September,saying it was ""time to end America's longest war"". The US had some 2,500 troops in the country as part of a 9,600-strong Nato mission. That would coincide with the 20th anniversary of the terror attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon in the US in 2001. The Taliban told the BBC this month that any foreign troops left in Afghanistan after Nato's September withdrawal deadline will be at risk as occupiers. But violence in the country continues to rise, with the Taliban taking more territory. Under a deal with the militant group, the US and its Nato allies agreed to withdraw all troops in return for a commitment by the Taliban not to allow al-Qaeda or any other extremist group to operate in the areas they control. After nearly 20 years of western military support, most Nato forces have now left the country for good. That includes the majority of the 750 British troops who were in the capital Kabul to assist with security and training. The head of the Armed Forces, General Sir Nick Carter, says that those British troops who served in Afghanistan can be proud of what they achieved. But even he describes the current security situation in Afghanistan as ""pretty grim"", with the Taliban making significant advances. General Carter says it's ""plausible"" that the country might now fracture along tribal and ethnic lines. Though he still believes the Taliban will not be able to control the whole country. A total of 475 British military personnel lost their lives in the country - most killed in Helmand before combat operations ended in 2014. Their families will question whether they really leave a lasting legacy - whether their sacrifice was in vain. Boris Johnson insists that Britain is not walking away from the country. There will still be a very small British military presence in Kabul to protect diplomatic missions. But did this costly Nato mission really achieve what it set out to do? Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner said the Taliban were ""making gains on the ground"" and ""serious questions remain about the future stability of Afghanistan"". ""A security threat remains to the wider world including to the UK, and nobody wants to see British troops permanently stationed in Afghanistan, but we simply cannot wash our hands or walk away,"" she said. There had been ""moments of huge difficulty"" in the last 20 years, Ms Rayner said, but Afghanistan's current situation ""is more concerning than at any other point in many years"". ""It's hard to see a future without bloodier conflict and wider Taliban control,"" she said. Mr Johnson told MPs Britain was ""not walking away"" from Afghanistan. ""We are keeping our embassy in Kabul and we will continue to work with our friends and allies, particularly with the government of Pakistan, to try to bring a settlement, to try to ensure that the Taliban understand that there can be no military path to victory and there must be a negotiated solution,"" he said.

People 'snapping up' post-Covid bucket list tripsOnline vaccine pass available for 'urgent' travel,"People are dreaming of holidays to the Maldives next year, travel agents say People are planning bucket list holidays due to ""pent up demand"" for a break, according to Welsh travel agents. They said places like the Maldives were being snapped up for 2022 with people ""definitely spending more"". But, for this year, the demand remains for UK staycations. Accommodation with hot tubs are proving popular along with cottages and lodges for families holidaying at home. The Welsh government has said people should only go abroad for ""essential purposes"", and First Minister Mark Drakeford has urged people to stay in Wales this year. Suzanne Cumpston, from Sam Smith Travel in Cowbridge, said the desire for international travel appears to have been ""suppressed"" for now - but longer term, people were looking to travel further afield. ""The appetite for 2021 is leaning towards UK staycations,"" she said. Summer bookings are made up of breaks at UK lodges and cottages, she said, with hot tubs a requirement whenever possible. Other customers have booked holidays to the Maldives, the US, Iceland and the Greek islands from the latter part of the year in the hope they can go ahead. Hot tubs are a requirement for staycations, say travel agents And one customer has just booked a Â£65,000 wedding party of about 15 people to Antigua in 2022. ""People are booking to go longer, [to] bucket list places and upgrading rooms because they have lost out,"" she said. Is it possible to visit France, Spain or other destinations? Holidays on the amber list - what you need to know Other travel agents told BBC Wales that customers have increased their holiday budget and booked luxury breaks to places including Mauritius and the Canadian Rockies in 2022. But for now many have opted for staycations in Wales, Devon, Cornwall and onUK cruises. Mark White, boss of Ocky White Travel, Haverfordwest, said ""it seems everything with a hot tub will sell"" when it comes to booking a holiday at home. He said he was advising people ""not to commit to 2021 foreign holidays"" until further reviews of the travel traffic light system and in the hope the green list will open up. Wales has atraffic light systemof travel, like in England, meaning countries are categorised due to risk. Portugal has now moved to the amber list, meaning arrivals must take two tests and quarantine for 10 days. ""Some people are still determined to go away,"" said Mr White. ""We are seeing more wish-list destinations coming through. ""People have learned not to take anything for granted and to take opportunities when they arise,"" he said. Sue Glen: ""You have to get on and enjoy your life"" Travel agent Darren Owen said customers at Snowdonia Travel and Cruise in Colwyn Bay have rescheduled foreign holidays up to four times due to Covid travel rules. He said that made it financially difficult for independent travel agents who do not receive their commission until a few weeks before people go on holiday. What's happening with foreign travel? Scramble to return as Portugal joins amber list Mr Owen said older people who have had their second Covid vaccine were booking foreign holidays for November and December, while families were booking to go abroad next May and June. Self employed travel agent Sue Glen, from Builth Wells, has taken up a second job as a Covid track and trace official with Powys council to help pay her bills, with customers also delaying their breaks up to four times. Fingers crossed: Angie Willmott is planning breaks in Crete and the Caribbean this year She said new foreign holiday bookings to places like the Maldives, Thailand and the US appeared to be more lavish, especially if customers have been able to save money during lockdown. And she said people holidaying at home were also prepared to pay in excess of Â£1,500 for a week's stay in a UK holiday cottage in order to ""make memories"". Holiday let firms 'blown away' by surge in demand Can I go on holiday abroad from Wales? ""You have to get on and enjoy your life,"" she said. ""So many times I have had that conversation with customers. ""We have had a pretty awful few years."" Health club receptionist Angie Willmott, from Cardiff, ""just loves holidays"". She has just returned from a weekend in Cornwall, and hopes to be able to enjoy breaks in Crete in July and a Caribbean cruise in December, if they are on the green list. ""We need to have some optimism,"" she said.

Thousands of fake online pharmacies shut down,"Sales of illicit pharmaceuticals have risen amid the Covid-19 pandemic A record number of fake online pharmacies were shut down in May as part of a global crackdown. More than 100,000 online marketplaces offering illicit drugs were removed as part of Interpol's Operation Pangea. In the UK, fake medicines worth more than $13m (Â£9.17m) were seized as part of the efforts. It marked the biggest week for the operation since 2008, as criminals cashed in on the demand for Covid-related products. Police break up 'fake Covid-19 vaccine network' 'Fake prescription drugs left my son brain damaged' Between 18 and 25 May, 277 arrests were made, involving 92 countries, and pharmaceuticals worth more than $20m seized. Most of the illegal medical devices seized were fake or unauthorised Covid-19 testing kits. UK authorities removed more than 3,100 advertising links for the illegal sale and supply of unlicensed medicines and 43 UK-based websites were closed down. Interpol, the International Criminal Police Organization, based in Lyon, France, facilitates international co-operation between police forces. Secretary general Jurgen Stock said the sale of illicit medicines put thousands of lives at risk. ""The online sale of illicit medicines continues to pose a threat to public safety, which is why operations such as Pangea remain vital in combating this global health scourge,"" he said. ""As the pandemic forced more people to move their lives online, criminals were quick to target these new customers. ""As crimes continue to evolve amidst the Covid-19 pandemic, the authorities must remain vigilant in dismantling criminal networks involved in the proliferation of illicit pharmaceutical products especially in online platforms."" The global pharmaceutical industry is worth more than $1tn. Vast supply chains stretch from key manufacturers in places such as China and India to packaging warehouses in Europe, South America or Asia and distributors sending medicines to every country in the world. Last year, a BBC News investigationfound fake drugs for sale in Africa, with counterfeiters exploiting growing gaps in the market.

Coronavirus fuels a surge in fake medicines,"Growing numbers of fake medicines linked to coronavirus are on sale in developing countries, the World Health Organization (WHO) has warned. A BBC News investigation found fake drugs for sale in Africa, with counterfeiters exploiting growing gaps in the market. The WHO said taking these drugs could have ""serious side effects"". One expert warned of ""a parallel pandemic, of substandard and falsified products"". Around the world, people are stockpiling basic medicines. However, with the world's two largest producers of medical supplies - China and India - in lockdown, demand now outstrips the supply and the circulation of dangerous counterfeit drugs is soaring. In the same week the World Health Organization (WHO) declared coronavirus a pandemic last month, Operation Pangea, Interpol's global pharmaceutical crime fighting unit, made 121 arrests across 90 countries in just seven days, resulting in the seizure of dangerous pharmaceuticals worth over $14m (Â£11m). From Malaysia to Mozambique, police officers confiscated tens of thousands of counterfeit face masks and fake medicines, many of which claimed to be able to cure coronavirus. Last month Interpol seized 34,000 counterfeit and substandard surgical masks ""The illicit trade in such counterfeit medical items during a public health crisis, shows a total disregard for people's lives,"" said Interpol's Secretary General Jurgen Stock. According to the WHO, the broader falsified medicines trade, which includes medicines which may be contaminated, contain the wrong or no active ingredient, or may be out-of-date, is worth more than $30bn in low and middle-income countries. ""Best case scenario they [fake medicines] probably won't treat the disease for which they were intended"", said Pernette Bourdillion Esteve, from the WHO team dealing with falsified medical products. ""But worst-case scenario they'll actively cause harm, because they might be contaminated with something toxic."" The global pharmaceutical industry is worth more than $1 trillion. Vast supply chains stretch all the way from key manufacturers in places such as China and India, to packaging warehouses in Europe, South America or Asia, to distributors sending medicines to every country in the world. There is ""probably nothing more globalised than medicine"" said Esteve. However, as the world goes into lockdown, the supply chain has already begun to uncouple. Several pharmaceutical companies in India told the BBC they are now operating at 50-60% of their normal capacity. As Indian companies supply 20% of all basic medicines to Africa, nations there are being disproportionately affected. Ephraim Phiri, a pharmacist in Zambia's capital Lusaka, said he was already feeling the strain. ""Medicines are already running out and we are not replenishing them. There is nothing we can do. It's been really hard to get supplies... especially essential medicines like antibiotics and antimalarials."" Producers and suppliers are also struggling as the raw ingredients to manufacture tablets are now so expensive, some companies can simply not afford to keep going. One producer in Pakistan said he used to buy the raw ingredients for an antimalarial drug called hydrochloroquine for about $100 a kilo. But today, the cost has increased to $1,150 a kilo. President Trump has touted the efficacy of hydrochloroquine - but there's no clear evidence it can help fight Covid-19 With an increasing number of countries going into lockdown, it's not only the reduction in production that's problematic, it's also the increase in demand, as people around the world anxiously stockpile basic medicines. It's this unstable combination of reduced supply and increased demand that has led the WHO to warn of a dangerous spike in the production and sales of fake drugs. ""When the supply does not meet the demand,"" said Esteve, from the WHO, ""it creates an environment where poorer quality or fake medicines will try to meet that demand."" Speaking to pharmacists and drug companies around the world, the global supply of antimalarials is now under threat. Ever since US President Donald Trump began referring to the potential of chloroquine and a related derivative, hydroxychloroquine, in White House briefings, there has been a global surge in the demand for these drugs, which are normally used to tackle malaria. Coronavirus and chloroquine: Is there evidence it works? The WHO has repeatedly said there is no definitive evidence that chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine can be used against the virus that causes Covid-19. However, at a recent news conference, whilst referring to these antimalarials, President Trump said: ""What do you have to lose? Take it."" As the demand has soared, the BBC has discovered large quantities of fake chloroquine in circulation in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Cameroon. The WHO has also found the fake medicines for sale in Niger. The antimalarial chloroquine is normally sold for about $40 for a pot of 1,000 tablets. But pharmacists in the DRC were found to be selling them for up to $250. The medicine being sold was allegedly manufactured in Belgium, by ""Brown and Burk Pharmaceutical limited"". However, Brown and Burk, a pharmaceutical company registered in the UK, said they had ""nothing to do with this medicine. We don't manufacture this drug, it's fake."" Counterfeit antimalarial drugs discovered in circulation in the DRC As the coronavirus pandemic continues, Professor Paul Newton, an expert in fake medicines at the University of Oxford, warned the circulation of fake and dangerous medicines would only increase unless governments around the world present a united front.

The fake medicines in Africa that can kill,"Government officials taking away fake drugs in Abidjan, Ivory Coast The proliferation of fake medicines in Africa is a public health crisis that can no longer be ignored, according to a UK charity. There's a meeting of seven African countries, in Togo, this week, to combat the problem. Congo, Niger, Senegal, Togo, Uganda, Ghana and The Gambiawill discuss measures to clamp down on trafficking in fake medicines, says the Brazzaville Foundation.,external But how big a problem is counterfeit medicine in Africa, and what impact does it have? Globally, the trade in counterfeit pharmaceuticals is worth up to $200bn (Â£150bn) annually, with Africa among the regions most affected, according to industry estimates. The World Health Organization (WHO) says42% of all fake medicines reported to them between 2013 and 2017 were from Africa,external. The European region and the Americas (North and South) accounted for 21% each. But how reliable are these figures? The WHO has a reporting mechanism that relies on national or regional regulatory authorities around the world to notify it of seizures. So the data for 2013-17 is only as good as the surveillance and reporting systems in the countries or regions concerned. The WHO has itself noted that as more officers were trained and national regulators became more aware, the numbers of drug seizure reports went up. So it's possible areas with weak regulation and enforcement may be under-reporting the extent of the problem. Bright Simons, who set up a mobile system to verify drugs in Ghana, says it's not possible to produce a precise estimate, as the trade is underground. But there've been several seizures in recent years, which give an indication of the size of the problem in West Africa: Ivory Coast, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia and Sierra Leone seized 19 tonnes of counterfeit medicines in 2018 Smugglers in Ivory Coast were intercepted trying to bring in 12 tonnes of counterfeit pharmaceuticals from Ghana in 2019 An Interpol-led operation in seven West African countries seized more than 420 tonnes of illicit pharmaceutical products in 2017 Nearly 19.88 tonnes of fake medicines were seized in Mali between 2015-18 The accounting firm PwC saysthe proportion of fake pharmaceuticals in some countries can be as high as 70%,external, in developing regions such as Africa. The WHO estimates one out of every 10 medical products in low- and middle-income countries, which includes most of Africa, is sub-standard or fake. Analysis by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine for the WHO estimates substandard and fake anti-malarial drugs could be causing 116,000 extra deaths from the disease every year in sub-Saharan Africa at a cost to patients and health systems of on average $38.5m a year. This video can not be played Solving the problem of fake drugs in Nigeria And in 2015, a study published in the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene estimatedmore than 122,000 children under the age of five died each year because of sub-standard anti-malarial drugs in sub-Saharan Africa,external. Although these results are only estimates, the scientists say they suggest poor quality drugs are important contributors to under-five mortality rates. Fake medicine can often be indistinguishable from the real products, with the packaging as good if not better than the original. Andweak or inconsistent legal frameworks and the lack of regulations,externalto address sales, often carried out online or in informal locations, add to the problem, the UN says. Drugs for sale at a roadside market in Lagos, Nigeria There's also an issue with the cost of drugs in poorer countries. ""If a good quality medicine from a known supplier is too expensive, people may try a cheaper one from an unlicensed supplier,"" the WHO says. Can technology help tackle fake drugs? Cutting prices for licensed drugs, however, does not guarantee a solution. Even low priced medicines can make money for criminals, as long as the sales volume is high enough. But there are some technological solutions being tried out to tackle the problem, including mobile apps to help users verify medicines, using scratch stickers, barcodes and other means of identification printed on packaging.

Will England's success boost the UK economy?,"Former England striker Alan Shearer has told the BBC that England's success in the Euro 2020 tournament so far has given the country ""joy"", ""relief"" and ""hope"" after a tough 18 months. But could this feelgood factor translate into an economic boost for the country as well? After the team reached its first major men's football final in 55 years on Wednesday, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said he expected to see a ""bounce"" in consumer confidence because of the tournament. Some businesses, however, say social distancing rules are stopping them from fully reaping the benefits. The chancellor expects a Euros bounce in consumer spending Simon French, chief economist at brokers Panmure Gordon, told the BBC that he agreed England's success could boost economic growth, alongside other factors. Part of this would be the impact of spending on hospitality as people watched games, something he estimates could contribute a relatively small Â£150m to UK GDP. But, he added: ""If a victory on one day coalesces with a broader feelgood factor, like we saw during during Euro 96 or the 2012 Olympics, it could boost consumer sentiment. England reach Euro 2020 final ""The difference this time is that UK households have a lot of pent-up savings due to the pandemic - we estimate about Â£20bn - and the speed with which they are spent is closely linked to consumer sentiment. ""Winning the final, along with lots of other things, like reopening, the easing of restrictions, could help unlock many billions of pounds worth of additional spending."" Independent economist Julian Jessop is more cautious, however. He tweeted,external: ""I'd love to say winning #euro2020 will boost the UK economy (or at least the English bits), but it wouldn't change any of the fundamentals. ""And clearly [it would be] trumped by everything else going on, especially the lifting of Covid restrictions."" Champagne sales could soar if England wins, says the Co-op Retail analyst Catherine Shuttleworth thinks it will be a ""massive"" weekend for the supermarkets, with the final due to be played on Sunday evening. She also expects a mini spending boom on items such as cars and homeware if England win, as well as a boost to productivity. ""We have gone through a period of misery which makes consumer sentiment quite low so people don't splash out,"" she said. ""But the vaccine programme is working which is massive source of hope. People in employment are feeling OK thanks to furlough. And now we have this massive confidence boost from the football which makes us all feel more positive and pull together."" The boss of beer, wines and spirits at Co-op, Simon Cairns, says the supermarket chain expects a ""bumper weekend"" ahead of the final on Sunday. ""We are expecting to sell and additional one million drinks on Sunday alone compared to our normal trading, which is twice what we could normally expect to sell,"" he told the BBC. ""If yesterday is anything go by those sales will be dominated by beer and cider. And in a nod to our Italian opponents we are expecting to see some bumper sales of things like Prosecco - a quarter of a million bottles we're expecting to sell between now and the end of Sunday."" He added that sales of snacks, burgers and barbecues were also expected to soar - as well as champagne sales - if England triumph. However, not everyone expects to reap the full economic benefits of the Euros. Simon Emeny, boss of pub and hotel operator Fuller, Smith & Turner, told the BBC that despite ""fantastic"" takings on Wednesday night, social distancing rules and capacity constraints had curbed profits. ""This is why 19 July [when Covid rules end] can't come soon enough for the sector,"" he said. ""Even [during the final] on Sunday, when our pubs will be pretty busy, we're operating at seriously reduced capacity and we just won't be able to satisfy demand."" John and Annette Powell run The Kenilworth pub The British Beer & Pub Association expects England fans to enjoy more than 13 million extra pints on Sunday. But it said the figure would be closer to 17 million - worth Â£9m in lost sales - if social distancing rules were removed. Annette Powell and her husband John run the Kenilworth Pub near Manchester and agree that the restrictions have capped profit during the tournament. Having to provide table service for all customers has meant doubling their number of staff to take around two-thirds of their normal takings - which would have been around Â£12,000 for the match on Wednesday. The Kenilworth also only fits a maximum of 160 customers with social distancing and has had to turn away at least another 150 on match days. ""We've had to upset a lot of loyal customers,"" Annette said. ""The Euros are a huge boost, it's just unfortunate it isn't what it could have been."" Owner Oliver Thain outside The Tickell Arms which showed yesterday's match However, Oliver Thain, who runs eight pubs and restaurants in Cambridgeshire, said he was hopeful the tournament's feelgood factor would last. He said the tournament had ""made hardly any difference"" to his largely food-based businesses and only two of his venues had screened games. But he thinks bookings will pick up as consumers feel more confident and the country continues to unlock. ""Sport can really up the country's spirit, so though it's difficult to put a figure on, the Euros certainly can't do any harm.""

Art project tells stories of Covid in care homes,"This video can not be played Care home residents on the ""loneliness"" of Covid An art project has been launched to help people living in care homes across Wales share their stories of the Covid pandemic. The Tell Me More project encouraged residents from several different homes to talk about what it was like to live in a care home during lockdown. More than 1,600 care home residents in Wales have died with Covid, according to the ONS. It is hoped a further 100 residents will be asked about their experiences. The artists sketched portraits of residents in homes in Anglesey, Fishguard, Mold, Porthcawl and Port Talbot and then animated them to create a short film. Margaret Wilson has not seen her husband of 72 years for ""some time"" during the pandemic Among those featured was 92-year-old Margaret Wilson, a retired nursing sister who lives in a care home on Anglesey. She said: ""I feel very lost and lonely at times. I haven't seen my husband and daughter for some while now. Margaret Wilson says she misses her family ""I see [my family] on Skype and that's a help. It's been a very strong virus and it's very difficult. It's been very difficult to cope with it all. ""They've taken good care of us here, it's been very strict at times, but I'm still here at 92 so I've been very well cared for, but I must admit, I miss my family."" Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales Nine in 10 have antibodies in Covid protection boost Margaret Pullen, 86, has lived in a care home in Aberavon, Neath Port Talbot, for about four years. She said she missed the company of others most of all. ""I was fed up with being in my room but there's nothing you can do about that. I was comfortable enough,"" she said. ""I had a radio and a telly. I was comfortable and there was a rota to have our meals. ""It was nice to go back into the dining room and see people I haven't seen for a while."" Margaret Pullen said she misses the choir which used to be run in the care home ""I miss the company of people, I was fed up of being in my room. I think we all were,"" she added. ""We had trips before the pandemic and we've started some trips now. It's nice to be able to get out."" Ms Pullen said it has been lovely to see family again and that it had been nice to get out to the Brecon Beacons, Mumbles and Porthcawl and she says she enjoys the ice creams they always have on the trips. But she said she misses the choir which used to be run in the care home. Margaret Pullen says nurses have not always had the respect they deserve As a retired nurse, Ms Wilson said she sympathises with those who have worked through the pandemic. ""Nursing is not an easy job and they don't always get the respect they deserve,"" she said. Care home residents have had to endure more than most during the pandemic. According to the ONS, care home residents have accounted for 1,674 Covid deaths in Wales - 21% of the total number of fatalities. In March and April 2020, at the start of the pandemic, there were 624 Covid-related deaths - a third of all deaths in care homes at that time. January 2021 saw a further 419 deaths in Welsh care homes. The Older People's Commissioner for Wales and the Equality and Human Rights Commission have both shared significant concerns about the experiences of older people, particularly those in care homes, during the pandemic. The Tell Me More project, which has been funded by Welsh government, has seen Age Cymru work with a group of artists to hold conversations with people in care homes. Vicki Lloyd, Age Cymru's chief executive, said care home residents should be ""really high up on the agenda"" as more restrictions relax and society returns to some kind of normality. ""Care home residents have been particularly affected by the pandemic, they've been locked down longer than most of us, they've been isolated from their friends and family. ""For many they've only had window visits or not seen family and friends at all. ""It's important we listen and learn in terms of decision making, when we're setting policy and informing practices we really need to listen to what care home residents are saying.""

'We have six unfilled jobs but no one has applied',"Mark and Jean Lee run a 15-bedroom bed and breakfast in Yorkshire ""If we were to open up in full swing it would be at least 12 jobs unfilled, but it's six unfilled at the moment."" Mark Lee runs the Red Lion Country Inn, a B&B in Yorkshire, but like many employers he cannot find enough staff. According to a survey of big recruitment firms, the number of permanent jobs available in England rose at its fastest rate since 1997 in June as the economy reopened. But at the same time availability of workers hit a 24-year low. Despite advertising on a range of sites, Mr Lee has not received a single application for jobs posted. Before the pandemic, he would frequently receive 50 or more applications per advert. He has also used agencies to find staff, but when he asked for a sous chef they could only provide an employee who had never worked in a catering kitchen before. Paying above minimum wage, Mr Lee employs waiters and cleaners on Â£10 per hour, which increases to Â£13 for a sous chef. KPMG and the Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC) polled 400 recruitment companies in June and found ""substantial increases"" in permanent and temporary job vacancies across the Midlands, the South, London and the North. Warnings of staff shortages due to self-isolation North and Midlands 'leading jobs recovery' The steepest increase in demand was seen for permanent private sector staff, particularly in the IT and computing, hotel and catering, and engineering sectors. Demand was also ""historically strong"" across the public sector. However, the survey found the supply of candidates had fallen for the fourth month in a row. Recruiters blamed increased hiring, Brexit, pandemic-related uncertainty and the furlough scheme. Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG, told the BBC's Today programme: ""We have seen the reopening of the economy and therefore there's a surge in demand, and not all the workers we were hoping to get are readily available. ""Some of them need to switch sector, some of them were looking after children before or were temporarily out of the jobs market. Some went into higher education or overseas."" Brian Lord says his firm is struggling to fill roles Brian Lord, chief executive of cybersecurity and intelligence consultancy PGI, has encountered the same issue in the IT sector. ""Covid has been the main driver in demand because remote working has meant more vulnerability for organisations,"" Mr Lord said. In June, PGI advertised 10 roles across its digital security teams but has only managed to fill two positions so far with the help of an in-house training academy. Mr Lord said the slow rate in hiring was due to potential employers ""invariably ending up in a bidding war"", which he said was often won by richer companies ""who are better able to absorb the increased overhead or more able to pass the increased cost on their client base"". ""There is just no unemployment in the sector and supply is struggling to keep up,"" he added. Manny Athwal, chief executive of the School of Coding in Wolverhampton, said employers have been contacting the school, which has 5,250 students, to recruit potential candidates before they even start courses. The findings come despite the UK's unemployment rate remaining relatively high due to the pandemic, at 4.7% in the three months to April. Gerwyn Davies from the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, said there was a danger of overhyping the shortages, with a fall in the number of young people currently in employed in the UK. In hospitality especially, Mr Davies said ""a perfect storm"" had occurred ""where we're seeing a demand for labour occur alongside a sharp fall in the stock of EU workers"". ""It's a question of employers having to work harder to recruit and train their staff rather than having no applicants,"" he added. REC chief executive Neil Carberry said: ""Recruiters are working flat out to fill roles across our economy. The jobs market is improving at the fastest pace we have ever seen, but it is still an unpredictable time. ""We can't yet tell how much the ending of furlough and greater candidate confidence will help to meet this rising demand for staff. In some key shortage sectors like hospitality, food, driving and IT, more support is likely to be needed to avoid slowing the recovery.""

Chancellor under pressure over 8% pension rise,"This video can not be played Chancellor Rishi Sunak: ""We want to make sure the decisions we make are fair... both for pensioners and for taxpayers"" The chancellor has given his strongest indication yet of ruling out a predicted 8% rise in the state pension next year. Official forecasts suggest that the link with earnings growth could mean the bumper rise in the amount paid from April 2022. Rishi Sunak told the BBC a decision on pensions would be ""based on fairness for pensioners and for taxpayers"". Various commentators have called for an overhaul of the rules. However, groups representing older people say the government's promises to pensioners should remain. Mr Sunak told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""The triple lock is government policy but I recognise people's concerns about what that might mean, given some of the numbers that are being put around. ""We will approach these decisions with fairness in mind - fairness for both pensioners but also for taxpayers."" He said there were ""some questions around the earnings numbers"". The rise in pensions each year is governed by what is known as the triple lock - a Conservative manifesto promise until at least 2024. This means the state pension increases in line with the rising cost of living seen in the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) measure of inflation, increasing average wages, or 2.5%, whichever of those three is highest. Predictions by the Bank of England suggest that average earnings could go up by 8%, hence the equivalent rise in the state pension. State pension predicted to rise by 8% Public finances at risk after Covid, says watchdog That would cost the Treasury Â£3bn more than previously anticipated, according to the government's official forecaster - the Office for Budget Responsibility. Many economists point out the sharp rise in earnings is an anomaly created, in part, by calculations being affected by people coming off furlough. There is no reason in law why the chancellor cannot change the way earnings are judged in the triple lock system. He is certainly under pressure to do some from some quarters. Lord David Willetts, president of the Resolution Foundation, a think tank focusing on people on lower incomes, said: ""The Covid crisis has laid bare the design faults of the triple lock, with a severe jobs crisis last year inadvertently contributing to an unnecessary and unjustified 8% rise in the state pension next year. ""The chancellor should take the opportunity this autumn to replace the triple lock with a smoothed earnings link. This would mean the state pension would rise in line with the living standards of working age people - a change that would be fair to all generations."" However, Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK, said: ""We do not think the government should rush headlong towards a decision to suspend it. Pensioner poverty has been rising in recent years. ""While older people we speak to are generally keen to do their bit to help as the pandemic continues, they are also wary of unscrupulous policymakers who might want use exceptional times as a reason to make permanent changes - a government sleight of hand that would not be acceptable at all."" The chancellor said that he would hold ""fairness in mind"" for any decision that it is made, but fairness can be hard to quantify. At present: The full, new flat-rate state pension (for those who reached state pension age after April 2016) is Â£179.60 a week The full, old basic state pension (for those who reached state pension age before April 2016) is Â£137.60 a week That is one of the least generous state pensions in Europe, even if there was a significant rise next year. The former pensions minister, Baroness Ros Altmann, also pointed out that, for many people, the state pension was their only retirement income. ""Millions of pensioners - especially women - rely solely on state pensions because they did not have the opportunity to build up private pensions when younger,"" she said. She has called for a wholesale review of pensioner benefits, rather than a short-term change in the rules. Other considerations of ""fairness"" might also include the wide range of life expectancy in different parts of the country, the different rules determining the rise in Pension Credit - a state pension top-up, and the expectations of younger people about their eventual state pension entitlement. At a time when the official recommendation for the main NHS pay award is well below inflation, a rise of 8% for the state pension would appear to be an outlier. The chancellor's comments this morning are the clearest indication that it will not happen. To be clear, it is very much a distortion. Average earnings were depressed in the pandemic by a reduction in hours worked. The official figures showed earnings were falling. From this lower base, the resumption of normality will lead to a very high number, when comparing one quarter this year to the same quarter in 2020 during lockdown. But this also reflects the design of the triple lock. As the OBR put it, ""it has no memory"". The point of the lock was, last year, to deliver a 2.5% rise in pensions this year, despite earnings being -1% and inflation being just 0.5%. The state pension was shielded from what was happening everywhere else in the economy last year. But its current design disregards that history and will lead to a compensatory bumper boost, if it is measured as in the past (growth in the quarter to July over same quarter last year), although we won't get the figures until autumn.

What are the overseas travel rules?,"Foreign travel is now easier for people in the UK than at any time since the beginning of the pandemic. However, there are still regulations about who can enter most countries, restrictions on what you can do when you get there, and rules to follow when you return home. These can change quickly, so it's important to keep checking theForeign Office guidance,externaland tourist information for your destination before you go. Here are some key things to know about travelling to popular destinations. Everyone travelling to Spain (including children) must submit an onlineHealth Control Form(in English), no more than 48 hours before departure. This will generate a QR code which needs to be presented (either digitally or as a hard copy) at the Spanish border. All travellers aged 12 and over must be able to prove they've been fully vaccinated (with both doses of a two-dose vaccine or one dose of a one-dose vaccine) at least 14 days before arrival. Proof of a negative test or recovery from Covid is not accepted. From 23:00 GMT on 13 February children aged 12-17 do not need to be double-jabbed to enter the country. Instead, they must  present a negative PCR test taken no more than 72 hours before arrival. You must have received your final vaccine dose no earlier than 270 days (about nine months) before travelling. If it was earlier than this, you must be able to show proof of having received a booster jab. There is no requirement for 14 days to have passed between receiving your booster and entering Spain.

"UK to see economic bounce from Euros, says SunakConsumer confidence is returning after lockdown and ""football just adds to it"", the chancellor says.","Former England striker Alan Shearer has told the BBC that England's success in the Euro 2020 tournament so far has given the country ""joy"", ""relief"" and ""hope"" after a tough 18 months. But could this feelgood factor translate into an economic boost for the country as well? After the team reached its first major men's football final in 55 years on Wednesday, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said he expected to see a ""bounce"" in consumer confidence because of the tournament. Some businesses, however, say social distancing rules are stopping them from fully reaping the benefits. The chancellor expects a Euros bounce in consumer spending Simon French, chief economist at brokers Panmure Gordon, told the BBC that he agreed England's success could boost economic growth, alongside other factors. Part of this would be the impact of spending on hospitality as people watched games, something he estimates could contribute a relatively small Â£150m to UK GDP. But, he added: ""If a victory on one day coalesces with a broader feelgood factor, like we saw during during Euro 96 or the 2012 Olympics, it could boost consumer sentiment. England reach Euro 2020 final ""The difference this time is that UK households have a lot of pent-up savings due to the pandemic - we estimate about Â£20bn - and the speed with which they are spent is closely linked to consumer sentiment. ""Winning the final, along with lots of other things, like reopening, the easing of restrictions, could help unlock many billions of pounds worth of additional spending."" Independent economist Julian Jessop is more cautious, however. He tweeted,external: ""I'd love to say winning #euro2020 will boost the UK economy (or at least the English bits), but it wouldn't change any of the fundamentals. ""And clearly [it would be] trumped by everything else going on, especially the lifting of Covid restrictions."" Champagne sales could soar if England wins, says the Co-op Retail analyst Catherine Shuttleworth thinks it will be a ""massive"" weekend for the supermarkets, with the final due to be played on Sunday evening. She also expects a mini spending boom on items such as cars and homeware if England win, as well as a boost to productivity. ""We have gone through a period of misery which makes consumer sentiment quite low so people don't splash out,"" she said. ""But the vaccine programme is working which is massive source of hope. People in employment are feeling OK thanks to furlough. And now we have this massive confidence boost from the football which makes us all feel more positive and pull together."" The boss of beer, wines and spirits at Co-op, Simon Cairns, says the supermarket chain expects a ""bumper weekend"" ahead of the final on Sunday. ""We are expecting to sell and additional one million drinks on Sunday alone compared to our normal trading, which is twice what we could normally expect to sell,"" he told the BBC. ""If yesterday is anything go by those sales will be dominated by beer and cider. And in a nod to our Italian opponents we are expecting to see some bumper sales of things like Prosecco - a quarter of a million bottles we're expecting to sell between now and the end of Sunday."" He added that sales of snacks, burgers and barbecues were also expected to soar - as well as champagne sales - if England triumph. However, not everyone expects to reap the full economic benefits of the Euros. Simon Emeny, boss of pub and hotel operator Fuller, Smith & Turner, told the BBC that despite ""fantastic"" takings on Wednesday night, social distancing rules and capacity constraints had curbed profits. ""This is why 19 July [when Covid rules end] can't come soon enough for the sector,"" he said. ""Even [during the final] on Sunday, when our pubs will be pretty busy, we're operating at seriously reduced capacity and we just won't be able to satisfy demand."" John and Annette Powell run The Kenilworth pub The British Beer & Pub Association expects England fans to enjoy more than 13 million extra pints on Sunday. But it said the figure would be closer to 17 million - worth Â£9m in lost sales - if social distancing rules were removed. Annette Powell and her husband John run the Kenilworth Pub near Manchester and agree that the restrictions have capped profit during the tournament. Having to provide table service for all customers has meant doubling their number of staff to take around two-thirds of their normal takings - which would have been around Â£12,000 for the match on Wednesday. The Kenilworth also only fits a maximum of 160 customers with social distancing and has had to turn away at least another 150 on match days. ""We've had to upset a lot of loyal customers,"" Annette said. ""The Euros are a huge boost, it's just unfortunate it isn't what it could have been."" Owner Oliver Thain outside The Tickell Arms which showed yesterday's match However, Oliver Thain, who runs eight pubs and restaurants in Cambridgeshire, said he was hopeful the tournament's feelgood factor would last. He said the tournament had ""made hardly any difference"" to his largely food-based businesses and only two of his venues had screened games. But he thinks bookings will pick up as consumers feel more confident and the country continues to unlock. ""Sport can really up the country's spirit, so though it's difficult to put a figure on, the Euros certainly can't do any harm.""

Ministers to consider easing more Covid-19 rules,"The Stormont executive agreed 26 July as an indicative date for easing quarantine rules From 26 July, fully vaccinated people returning to Northern Ireland from so-called amber countries will not have to quarantine under new indicative dates agreed by the executive for lifting Covid restrictions. Stormont ministers agreed the changes when they met on Thursday. They also agreed that theatres are to be allowed to reopen on 26 July. The requirement for face coverings to be worn in places of worship could also be removed then. However, most proposals will need to be ratified at an executive meeting on 22 July. What can I do as NI's Covid restrictions ease? The plans agreed at Thursday's executive meeting mean that Northern Ireland will not directly follow the approach Prime Minister Boris Johnson has outlined for England. He has said masks will no longer be required and social distancing rules will be scrapped for England at the final stage of his government's plan, due to take effect on 19 July. The plan to end the mandatory wearing of masks in England on 19 July will not be replicated in Northern Ireland Stormont ministers have agreed to make the following changes on 26 July, subject to health advice: the reopening of theatres and indoor seated venues for performances - with mitigations including entry only by tickets bought ahead of an event the return of conferences and exhibitions live music indoors with no restrictions on sound levels 10 people from three households to meet indoors in a private home 15 people from any number of households to meet in a private garden remove the ""linked households/bubble"" provision close contact services to operate without appointments reduce the legal requirement for social distancing to 1m indoors and remove it for all outdoor activities - instead keeping social distancing guidance to advise 1m if possible for all activities indoors and outdoors remove some restrictions in MoT centres to make it easier for examiners to carry out vehicle tests It is understood ministers also agreed to consider removing the guidelines for students to wear face coverings in classrooms and school ""bubbles"" but that, along with other measures, would be subject to public health conditions on 22 July. It is understood the executive has agreed to give consideration to the full return of live music and dancing without mitigations later in August. The BBC understands ministers will at that stage, also look at lifting remaining restrictions on mandatory use of face coverings, as well as the removal of social distancing and isolating. The government's Transport Secretary Grant Shapps hasset out his plans for England. From 19 July, fully vaccinated adults there will not need to isolate from amber list countries.

It is believed all of the measures would still need to be rubber stamped closer to the time at an executive meeting on 22 July. Theatres and some other audience venues have been closed or had to restrict numbers throughout the  pandemic because of social-distancing guidance. Johnson's Covid-easing plan reckless, says O'Neill NI public urged to keep wearing masks They had previously been given an indicative date of 21 June for their reopening but the executive has so far delayed that. Jimmy Fay of the Lyric Theatre in Belfast said on Thursday that the vaccination programme had been ""such a success that we need to look at a date, preferably in September, when we can remove all social distancing in theatres"". Some other indoor entertainment venues such as cinemas have been allowed to resume trading. Speaking after the executive meeting, First Minister Paul Givan said ministers from his party - the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) - believed more progress could be made ""at a faster pace"". ""We believe that is backed up by all of the data, the scientific evidence, the impact on our economy and the impact on family and wider society,"" said Mr Givan. The minister said the executive had received a ""very positive report"" about a falling number of Covid-19-related deaths, but that other ministers decided they wanted to ""move forward at a slower pace"". Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said the executive had taken a ""cautious"" and ""steady"" approach, which she believed was the ""right one"". She said ""the Boris Johnson approach"" to easing restrictions was reckless. ""Based on our own information and our own data we have taken decisions today that demonstrates progress, demonstrates that we're able to continue to make some easements,"" said Ms O'Neill. Earlier Sir Michael McBride, Northern Ireland's chief medical officer, has expressed concern about mixed messages on issues such as masks. This video can not be played Concern over public messaging 'inconsistencies' around face masks ""It's important that we guard against sending the public mixed messages about the evidence around matters such as face coverings and the benefit of face coverings,"" he said. ""Whether those are mandatory or whether those are voluntary, those are policy matters and ultimately a matter for ministers.""

What are the rules for overseas travel?,"Foreign travel is now easier for people in the UK than at any time since the beginning of the pandemic. However, there are still regulations about who can enter most countries, restrictions on what you can do when you get there, and rules to follow when you return home. These can change quickly, so it's important to keep checking theForeign Office guidance,externaland tourist information for your destination before you go. Here are some key things to know about travelling to popular destinations. Everyone travelling to Spain (including children) must submit an onlineHealth Control Form(in English), no more than 48 hours before departure. This will generate a QR code which needs to be presented (either digitally or as a hard copy) at the Spanish border. All travellers aged 12 and over must be able to prove they've been fully vaccinated (with both doses of a two-dose vaccine or one dose of a one-dose vaccine) at least 14 days before arrival. Proof of a negative test or recovery from Covid is not accepted. From 23:00 GMT on 13 February children aged 12-17 do not need to be double-jabbed to enter the country.

"UK to see economic bounce from Euros, says Sunak","Former England striker Alan Shearer has told the BBC that England's success in the Euro 2020 tournament so far has given the country ""joy"", ""relief"" and ""hope"" after a tough 18 months. But could this feelgood factor translate into an economic boost for the country as well? After the team reached its first major men's football final in 55 years on Wednesday, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said he expected to see a ""bounce"" in consumer confidence because of the tournament. Some businesses, however, say social distancing rules are stopping them from fully reaping the benefits. The chancellor expects a Euros bounce in consumer spending Simon French, chief economist at brokers Panmure Gordon, told the BBC that he agreed England's success could boost economic growth, alongside other factors. Part of this would be the impact of spending on hospitality as people watched games, something he estimates could contribute a relatively small Â£150m to UK GDP. But, he added: ""If a victory on one day coalesces with a broader feelgood factor, like we saw during during Euro 96 or the 2012 Olympics, it could boost consumer sentiment. England reach Euro 2020 final ""The difference this time is that UK households have a lot of pent-up savings due to the pandemic - we estimate about Â£20bn - and the speed with which they are spent is closely linked to consumer sentiment. ""Winning the final, along with lots of other things, like reopening, the easing of restrictions, could help unlock many billions of pounds worth of additional spending."" Independent economist Julian Jessop is more cautious, however. He tweeted,external: ""I'd love to say winning #euro2020 will boost the UK economy (or at least the English bits), but it wouldn't change any of the fundamentals. ""And clearly [it would be] trumped by everything else going on, especially the lifting of Covid restrictions."" Champagne sales could soar if England wins, says the Co-op Retail analyst Catherine Shuttleworth thinks it will be a ""massive"" weekend for the supermarkets, with the final due to be played on Sunday evening. She also expects a mini spending boom on items such as cars and homeware if England win, as well as a boost to productivity. ""We have gone through a period of misery which makes consumer sentiment quite low so people don't splash out,"" she said. ""But the vaccine programme is working which is massive source of hope. People in employment are feeling OK thanks to furlough. And now we have this massive confidence boost from the football which makes us all feel more positive and pull together."" The boss of beer, wines and spirits at Co-op, Simon Cairns, says the supermarket chain expects a ""bumper weekend"" ahead of the final on Sunday. ""We are expecting to sell and additional one million drinks on Sunday alone compared to our normal trading, which is twice what we could normally expect to sell,"" he told the BBC. ""If yesterday is anything go by those sales will be dominated by beer and cider. And in a nod to our Italian opponents we are expecting to see some bumper sales of things like Prosecco - a quarter of a million bottles we're expecting to sell between now and the end of Sunday."" He added that sales of snacks, burgers and barbecues were also expected to soar - as well as champagne sales - if England triumph. However, not everyone expects to reap the full economic benefits of the Euros. Simon Emeny, boss of pub and hotel operator Fuller, Smith & Turner, told the BBC that despite ""fantastic"" takings on Wednesday night, social distancing rules and capacity constraints had curbed profits. ""This is why 19 July [when Covid rules end] can't come soon enough for the sector,"" he said. ""Even [during the final] on Sunday, when our pubs will be pretty busy, we're operating at seriously reduced capacity and we just won't be able to satisfy demand."" John and Annette Powell run The Kenilworth pub The British Beer & Pub Association expects England fans to enjoy more than 13 million extra pints on Sunday. But it said the figure would be closer to 17 million - worth Â£9m in lost sales - if social distancing rules were removed. Annette Powell and her husband John run the Kenilworth Pub near Manchester and agree that the restrictions have capped profit during the tournament. Having to provide table service for all customers has meant doubling their number of staff to take around two-thirds of their normal takings - which would have been around Â£12,000 for the match on Wednesday. The Kenilworth also only fits a maximum of 160 customers with social distancing and has had to turn away at least another 150 on match days. ""We've had to upset a lot of loyal customers,"" Annette said. ""The Euros are a huge boost, it's just unfortunate it isn't what it could have been."" Owner Oliver Thain outside The Tickell Arms which showed yesterday's match However, Oliver Thain, who runs eight pubs and restaurants in Cambridgeshire, said he was hopeful the tournament's feelgood factor would last. He said the tournament had ""made hardly any difference"" to his largely food-based businesses and only two of his venues had screened games. But he thinks bookings will pick up as consumers feel more confident and the country continues to unlock. ""Sport can really up the country's spirit, so though it's difficult to put a figure on, the Euros certainly can't do any harm.""

"House prices to continue rising as supply shrinksA lack of available properties will continue to help push house prices up, according to surveyors.","A lack of available properties is helping to push up house prices, surveyors say. As a result, a majority of Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) members think prices will continue to rise over the next year. The shrinking supply meant the number of new properties coming to the market fell by a third in June. But with no let-up in demand, all parts of the UK continued to report robust increases in house prices, RICS said. ""Respondents are pretty unanimous in once again highlighting the challenge around supply, whether in the sales or rental markets,"" said Simon Rubinsohn, RICS chief economist. With demand increasing and supply continuing to falter, a net balance of 83% of surveyors reported an increase. Looking ahead, a net balance of 56% anticipated that prices will continue to increase over the next twelve months. Demand from tenants rose in June, boosting the rental market and pushing up rent costs. A net balance of 60% of surveyors noted a rise in demand, up from 48% in May. But a shortfall in new landlord instructions intensified with a net balance of -32% of surveyors reporting a decline in supply. Surveyors predicted rental growth would grow slightly as a result, suggesting a 3% rise over the coming twelve months, including in London, where the rental market has bounced back since a RICS assessment earlier in the year. There were notable sharp house rises in Yorkshire & the Humber, Northern Ireland and Wales, according to surveyors. Ben Hudson, York surveyor reported: ""The busiest sales month on record with the push towards the end of June stamp duty deadline."" How much stamp duty will I have to pay now? In Haverfordwest in Wales, Paul Lucas said: ""The sales market is currently extremely buoyant with buyers moving to Pembrokeshire from both England and many parts of Wales."" But London is presenting a different picture, said Allan Fuller, Putney surveyor. ""New buyer enquiries have reduced except for larger houses where demand remains strong, as opposed to flats,"" he said. Mr Rubinsohn said the government needed to continue to help increase the supply of new homes. ""While the role of the credit channel and the extended period of ultra-low interest rates can't be ignored, it is critical the government is able to create the conditions to support higher levels of new build development to address the worsening affordability challenge,"" he said. But he added homes are ""needed across all tenures"", including social and private rent alongside home ownership. A spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said ""decisive action"" was being taken to ensure the country had the new homes and ownership options needed. ""We delivered more than 243,000 homes last year - the highest in over 30 years and the seventh year in a row with an increase,"" the person said. The department also pointed out the government had reformed the planning system, and that measures such as Help to Buy and shared ownership were in place.

"Travel changes for double-jabbed to be set outHow, when and who will benefit from changes to quarantine rules will be detailed in the Commons later.UKComments","Details about how and when fully vaccinated travellers can return from certain countries without having to quarantine are to be set out later. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps will make a statement to MPs this morning. Currently, those arriving in the UK have to follow strict rules regardless of their vaccine status, and anyone returning from countries on the amber or red list must isolate for 10 days. Travel bosses have called for the rules to be eased as soon as possible. The UK'straffic light system for international travelis still in force. Fewer than 30 destinations are on the green list - meaning travellers do not have to self-isolate when they get back to the UK but they do have to pay for Covid tests. More than 50 countries are on the strictest red list, which requires arrivals to pay to self-isolate in a hotel for 10 days. But most places - including several holiday hotspots such as mainland Spain, Greece and the US - are on the amber list. People returning from these countries must quarantine for 10 days and pay for tests. What are the green, amber and red rules? How can I prove I've had both my Covid jabs? The rules for holiday spots like Portugal, Malta and Spain The government has already said it was planning to scrap the need to quarantine for those who are double-jabbed and returning from amber countries. But it has not set out how it would work, when it would happen, and whether unvaccinated children would also be able to avoid quarantine if their parents are fully vaccinated. In addition to relaxing the rules around isolation for travellers, Chancellor Rishi Sunak told the BBC that the health secretary was considering a ""more proportionate and balanced approach"" to isolation for Covid contacts. It comes amid fears that surging cases across the UK will lead to millions of people being asked to self-isolate during the summer, even if they have been fully vaccinated. ""I recognise people's frustrations with this. I have spoken to the health secretary and he's also aware of this,"" Mr Sunak told BBC Breakfast. ""He's looking at the difference between the two systems [contact tracers and the NHS app] and seeing what might be a more proportionate and balanced approach to this."" The transport secretary's travel update in the House of Commons is due at 11:30 BST. The UK government's traffic light system applies toEngland,,externalwithScotland,external,Wales,externalandNorthern Ireland,externalable to make their own rules. However, the rules are broadly the same and previous changes to the lists have been adopted by all four nations. Melanie's husband was diagnosed with cancer last summer Melanie Matheis lives in California. Her daughter Allana left to go to drama school in London in September, and a few months later Melanie's husband died after being diagnosed with cancer. Allana couldn't come back for her father's funeral or for Christmas because of the UK's travel restrictions. ""She wouldn't have been able to go back to school when she went back to London because of the quarantine,"" Melanie tells the BBC, ""so she made the difficult decision to stay there."" She adds: ""It was difficult for myself as well being alone."" Melanie is double-jabbed and was hoping to visit her daughter in London this month, but has put it back by a few weeks once it became clear the rules were not changing. The US is on the UK's amber list, meaning Melanie would have to quarantine somewhere when she arrives. Without a home here, she would have to pay for a hotel room and tests which she can't afford. ""It would be double the expense and it's just not really possible,"" she says. ""It would make it very difficult."" The travel industry is eager to have the rules relaxed. Daniel Pearce, the head of Travel Trade Gazette, a monthly magazine for the travel industry, said the industry had been ""crying out"" for quarantine exemptions. He said he hoped changes would coincide with the wider easingof lockdown rules in England on 19 July., as that would allow the travel industry to capitalise on the family summer holiday market. ""Any change as early as this would enable some form of summer season to take place during the children's school holidays,"" he said. However, other groups are concerned about the plan to open up society further. In a letter to medical journal The Lancet,,externalmore than 120 scientists and doctors have called on the UK government to rethink its plan to end restrictions in England on 19 July, calling it ""dangerous and premature"", saying millions more people will became infected if it goes ahead. The government should wait until everyone, including adolescents, have been offered the vaccine before opening up, they say. The traffic light system sets the rules travellers must follow on their return. But holidaymakers also need tocheck their destination's entry rules. For example, all non-vaccinated travellers to mainlandPortugalneed a negative Covid test, and must quarantine for 14 days. Twelve to 17-year-olds travelling with fully-vaccinated parents don't have to quarantine but need a negative test. Under-11s are exempt. Only fully-vaccinated adults can travel toMalta, and don't need a negative test. Children aged 5-11 can travel with fully-vaccinated adults, but need a negative test. Under-5s don't need a test. Unvaccinated 12 to 17-year olds can't enter. Over-12s travelling toSpainneed a negative test or proof of vaccination. Unvaccinated travellers can only enterFrancefor ""essential reasons"", and must self-isolate for seven days. Fully-vaccinated adults with a negative test can enter. Under-18s travelling with fully-vaccinated adults don't need to self-isolate. More than 32,000 new coronavirus caseswere announced on Wednesday,,externalas well as 33 more deaths. Nearly two-thirds of the adult population in the UK have received two jabs, and 86% have had a first dose. Prof Andrew Hayward, a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), which advises ministers, stressed it was ""still very important"" to try to control the Delta variant, despite the success of the vaccine rollout. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""If we abandon general population social distancing measures as a means of control, then we will very likely see a massive peak of infections and, whilst the vaccines are excellent, they're not perfect. ""And so, if we get to a very small percentage of a massive number of cases getting hospitalised, that's still a very large number."" The government has said that public health remains its priority and it is taking a cautious approach to the resumption of international travel.

Art project tells stories of Covid in care homesCare home residents join forces with artists to tell their story of the coronavirus lockdown.WalesArt project tells stories of Covid in care homesCare home residents join forces with artists to tell their story of the coronavirus lockdown.Wales,"This video can not be played Care home residents on the ""loneliness"" of Covid An art project has been launched to help people living in care homes across Wales share their stories of the Covid pandemic. The Tell Me More project encouraged residents from several different homes to talk about what it was like to live in a care home during lockdown. More than 1,600 care home residents in Wales have died with Covid, according to the ONS. It is hoped a further 100 residents will be asked about their experiences. The artists sketched portraits of residents in homes in Anglesey, Fishguard, Mold, Porthcawl and Port Talbot and then animated them to create a short film. Margaret Wilson has not seen her husband of 72 years for ""some time"" during the pandemic Among those featured was 92-year-old Margaret Wilson, a retired nursing sister who lives in a care home on Anglesey. She said: ""I feel very lost and lonely at times. I haven't seen my husband and daughter for some while now. Margaret Wilson says she misses her family ""I see [my family] on Skype and that's a help. It's been a very strong virus and it's very difficult. It's been very difficult to cope with it all. ""They've taken good care of us here, it's been very strict at times, but I'm still here at 92 so I've been very well cared for, but I must admit, I miss my family.""

""I had a radio and a telly. I was comfortable and there was a rota to have our meals. ""It was nice to go back into the dining room and see people I haven't seen for a while."" Margaret Pullen said she misses the choir which used to be run in the care home ""I miss the company of people, I was fed up of being in my room. I think we all were,"" she added. ""We had trips before the pandemic and we've started some trips now. It's nice to be able to get out."" Ms Pullen said it has been lovely to see family again and that it had been nice to get out to the Brecon Beacons, Mumbles and Porthcawl and she says she enjoys the ice creams they always have on the trips. But she said she misses the choir which used to be run in the care home. Margaret Pullen says nurses have not always had the respect they deserve As a retired nurse, Ms Wilson said she sympathises with those who have worked through the pandemic. ""Nursing is not an easy job and they don't always get the respect they deserve,"" she said. Care home residents have had to endure more than most during the pandemic. According to the ONS, care home residents have accounted for 1,674 Covid deaths in Wales - 21% of the total number of fatalities. In March and April 2020, at the start of the pandemic, there were 624 Covid-related deaths - a third of all deaths in care homes at that time. January 2021 saw a further 419 deaths in Welsh care homes. The Older People's Commissioner for Wales and the Equality and Human Rights Commission have both shared significant concerns about the experiences of older people, particularly those in care homes, during the pandemic. The Tell Me More project, which has been funded by Welsh government, has seen Age Cymru work with a group of artists to hold conversations with people in care homes. Vicki Lloyd, Age Cymru's chief executive, said care home residents should be ""really high up on the agenda"" as more restrictions relax and society returns to some kind of normality. ""Care home residents have been particularly affected by the pandemic, they've been locked down longer than most of us, they've been isolated from their friends and family.

House prices to continue rising as supply shrinks,"A lack of available properties is helping to push up house prices, surveyors say. As a result, a majority of Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) members think prices will continue to rise over the next year. The shrinking supply meant the number of new properties coming to the market fell by a third in June. But with no let-up in demand, all parts of the UK continued to report robust increases in house prices, RICS said. ""Respondents are pretty unanimous in once again highlighting the challenge around supply, whether in the sales or rental markets,"" said Simon Rubinsohn, RICS chief economist. With demand increasing and supply continuing to falter, a net balance of 83% of surveyors reported an increase. Looking ahead, a net balance of 56% anticipated that prices will continue to increase over the next twelve months. Demand from tenants rose in June, boosting the rental market and pushing up rent costs. A net balance of 60% of surveyors noted a rise in demand, up from 48% in May. But a shortfall in new landlord instructions intensified with a net balance of -32% of surveyors reporting a decline in supply. Surveyors predicted rental growth would grow slightly as a result, suggesting a 3% rise over the coming twelve months, including in London, where the rental market has bounced back since a RICS assessment earlier in the year. There were notable sharp house rises in Yorkshire & the Humber, Northern Ireland and Wales, according to surveyors. Ben Hudson, York surveyor reported: ""The busiest sales month on record with the push towards the end of June stamp duty deadline."" How much stamp duty will I have to pay now? In Haverfordwest in Wales, Paul Lucas said: ""The sales market is currently extremely buoyant with buyers moving to Pembrokeshire from both England and many parts of Wales."" But London is presenting a different picture, said Allan Fuller, Putney surveyor. ""New buyer enquiries have reduced except for larger houses where demand remains strong, as opposed to flats,"" he said. Mr Rubinsohn said the government needed to continue to help increase the supply of new homes. ""While the role of the credit channel and the extended period of ultra-low interest rates can't be ignored, it is critical the government is able to create the conditions to support higher levels of new build development to address the worsening affordability challenge,"" he said. But he added homes are ""needed across all tenures"", including social and private rent alongside home ownership. A spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said ""decisive action"" was being taken to ensure the country had the new homes and ownership options needed. ""We delivered more than 243,000 homes last year - the highest in over 30 years and the seventh year in a row with an increase,"" the person said. The department also pointed out the government had reformed the planning system, and that measures such as Help to Buy and shared ownership were in place.

'We have 12 unfilled jobs but no one has applied',"Mark and Jean Lee run a 15-bedroom bed and breakfast in Yorkshire ""If we were to open up in full swing it would be at least 12 jobs unfilled, but it's six unfilled at the moment."" Mark Lee runs the Red Lion Country Inn, a B&B in Yorkshire, but like many employers he cannot find enough staff. According to a survey of big recruitment firms, the number of permanent jobs available in England rose at its fastest rate since 1997 in June as the economy reopened. But at the same time availability of workers hit a 24-year low. Despite advertising on a range of sites, Mr Lee has not received a single application for jobs posted. Before the pandemic, he would frequently receive 50 or more applications per advert. He has also used agencies to find staff, but when he asked for a sous chef they could only provide an employee who had never worked in a catering kitchen before. Paying above minimum wage, Mr Lee employs waiters and cleaners on Â£10 per hour, which increases to Â£13 for a sous chef. KPMG and the Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC) polled 400 recruitment companies in June and found ""substantial increases"" in permanent and temporary job vacancies across the Midlands, the South, London and the North. Warnings of staff shortages due to self-isolation North and Midlands 'leading jobs recovery' The steepest increase in demand was seen for permanent private sector staff, particularly in the IT and computing, hotel and catering, and engineering sectors. Demand was also ""historically strong"" across the public sector. However, the survey found the supply of candidates had fallen for the fourth month in a row. Recruiters blamed increased hiring, Brexit, pandemic-related uncertainty and the furlough scheme. Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG, told the BBC's Today programme: ""We have seen the reopening of the economy and therefore there's a surge in demand, and not all the workers we were hoping to get are readily available. ""Some of them need to switch sector, some of them were looking after children before or were temporarily out of the jobs market. Some went into higher education or overseas."" Brian Lord says his firm is struggling to fill roles Brian Lord, chief executive of cybersecurity and intelligence consultancy PGI, has encountered the same issue in the IT sector. ""Covid has been the main driver in demand because remote working has meant more vulnerability for organisations,"" Mr Lord said. In June, PGI advertised 10 roles across its digital security teams but has only managed to fill two positions so far with the help of an in-house training academy. Mr Lord said the slow rate in hiring was due to potential employers ""invariably ending up in a bidding war"", which he said was often won by richer companies ""who are better able to absorb the increased overhead or more able to pass the increased cost on their client base"". ""There is just no unemployment in the sector and supply is struggling to keep up,"" he added. Manny Athwal, chief executive of the School of Coding in Wolverhampton, said employers have been contacting the school, which has 5,250 students, to recruit potential candidates before they even start courses. The findings come despite the UK's unemployment rate remaining relatively high due to the pandemic, at 4.7% in the three months to April. Gerwyn Davies from the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, said there was a danger of overhyping the shortages, with a fall in the number of young people currently in employed in the UK. In hospitality especially, Mr Davies said ""a perfect storm"" had occurred ""where we're seeing a demand for labour occur alongside a sharp fall in the stock of EU workers"". ""It's a question of employers having to work harder to recruit and train their staff rather than having no applicants,"" he added. REC chief executive Neil Carberry said: ""Recruiters are working flat out to fill roles across our economy. The jobs market is improving at the fastest pace we have ever seen, but it is still an unpredictable time. ""We can't yet tell how much the ending of furlough and greater candidate confidence will help to meet this rising demand for staff. In some key shortage sectors like hospitality, food, driving and IT, more support is likely to be needed to avoid slowing the recovery.""

Anger at slow progress over mesh scandal,"Leanne Matthews, Alison Jackson and Marie Lyon all gave evidence to the review Baroness Julia Cumberlege, who led a critical review into how the health service has treated female patients, says she is angry and frustrated not enough progress has been made. Her 2020 report looked into two drugs and a medical device which caused women or their babies harm. It made a list of recommendations to support victims and prevent future, avoidable damage. The four UK governments are still considering the recommendations. A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care in England plans to fully respond later this year. Baroness Cumberlege and her team spent two yearsspeaking to more than 700 womenand their families who experienced complications linked to three treatments. The first is sodium valproate. This is an epilepsy drug which, if taken during pregnancy, can increase a baby's risk of developmental disorders and physical abnormalities. Campaigners say women are still not being properly warned of the risks. The second is pelvic mesh implants, which are used to treat prolapse and incontinence. However, complications can cause debilitating pain ""like shards of glass inside the body"". The procedure is only offered on the NHS in exceptional circumstances. Finally primodos - a hormonal pregnancy test thought to be associated with birth defects and miscarriages, something manufacturer, Schering, now part of Bayer, denies. It was withdrawn from the market in 1978. The First Do No Harm report concluded thousands of lives were ruined because officials failed to listen to female patients. It made nine recommendations, but only two of them have been fully implemented. These are a government apology to the victims and the promise to introduce Patient Safety Commissioners, an advocate for patients, in England and Scotland. ""If all our recommendations are not implemented, avoidable harm will continue to be performed,"" says Baroness Cumberlege. ""I hoped we would have achieved so much more in this past year. I am very angry and frustrated. ""These people are still suffering and need care and compassion. I will take their heartbreaking stories to my grave."" Baroness Cumberlege is urging the government to reconsider its decision to rule out setting up a Redress Agency, which would compensate women and families for the suffering they have experienced. The government is, however, looking at setting up a payment scheme that would cover the cost of providing additional care and support for those affected. Lawyers representing families agree with both recommendations and have written to the Secretary of State for Health, Sajid Javid, asking him to implement them. All three children in the Matthews family were born with health and learning problems after their mother took sodium valproate while pregnant. Like thousands of women, Leanne Matthews was never warned of the risks of taking sodium valproate during her three pregnancies. Her children were all born with many health and learning problems, and she fears for their future without financial support. ""It's going to be worrying when we're not here,"" she says. Her husband Warren agrees: ""What jobs are they going to do? What prospects do they have? As soon as you put down on your CV that you've got multiple medical conditions, who's going to employ you? ""When the buffer of mum and dad is gone, it's going to be the eldest daughter who has to take that responsibility, which she shouldn't have to do. She's got her own problems."" Baroness Cumberlege also recommended that specialist centres should be set up to help women who have experienced complications following a pelvic mesh procedure, and to provide care for those affected by medications taken during pregnancy. Seven mesh centres have now been set up in England, and one in NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde - but the other point is still being considered. Alison Jackson, from South Derbyshire, struggled to walk following her mesh repair Alison Jackson, from Swadlincote in South Derbyshire, used to be a keen runner, but after having mesh fitted she could hardly walk. Two weeks ago, she had her implant removed at one of the new centres, and would like to see more people benefit. ""The referral process should be easier and there should be more sites, though only if there are enough surgeons with the right expertise,"" she said. ""Mesh removal is like getting chewing gum out of hair. I know women who have been left with permanent nerve damage. There's no guarantee I will get better, but any improvement is a good thing."" Alison also wants the specialist services to be extended to all mesh-injured patients, such as hernia and rectopexy. Twelve months after the Cumberlege review was released, the chair of the Association for Children Damaged by Hormone Pregnancy Tests says she's losing confidence the government will make all of the recommendations law. Marie Lyon was prescribed Primodos. Marie Lyon was prescribed primodos and later gave birth to a daughter whose limbs were not fully formed. ""It will all be down to money and what can they get away with,"" she says. ""That is betraying all future patients of the NHS, which is a disgrace.""

However, complications can cause debilitating pain ""like shards of glass inside the body"". The procedure is only offered on the NHS in exceptional circumstances. Finally primodos - a hormonal pregnancy test thought to be associated with birth defects and miscarriages, something manufacturer, Schering, now part of Bayer, denies. It was withdrawn from the market in 1978. The First Do No Harm report concluded thousands of lives were ruined because officials failed to listen to female patients. It made nine recommendations, but only two of them have been fully implemented. These are a government apology to the victims and the promise to introduce Patient Safety Commissioners, an advocate for patients, in England and Scotland. ""If all our recommendations are not implemented, avoidable harm will continue to be performed,"" says Baroness Cumberlege. ""I hoped we would have achieved so much more in this past year. I am very angry and frustrated. ""These people are still suffering and need care and compassion. I will take their heartbreaking stories to my grave."" Baroness Cumberlege is urging the government to reconsider its decision to rule out setting up a Redress Agency, which would compensate women and families for the suffering they have experienced. The government is, however, looking at setting up a payment scheme that would cover the cost of providing additional care and support for those affected. Lawyers representing families agree with both recommendations and have written to the Secretary of State for Health, Sajid Javid, asking him to implement them. All three children in the Matthews family were born with health and learning problems after their mother took sodium valproate while pregnant. Like thousands of women, Leanne Matthews was never warned of the risks of taking sodium valproate during her three pregnancies. Her children were all born with many health and learning problems, and she fears for their future without financial support. ""It's going to be worrying when we're not here,"" she says. Her husband Warren agrees: ""What jobs are they going to do? What prospects do they have? As soon as you put down on your CV that you've got multiple medical conditions, who's going to employ you? ""When the buffer of mum and dad is gone, it's going to be the eldest daughter who has to take that responsibility, which she shouldn't have to do. She's got her own problems."" Baroness Cumberlege also recommended that specialist centres should be set up to help women who have experienced complications following a pelvic mesh procedure, and to provide care for those affected by medications taken during pregnancy. Seven mesh centres have now been set up in England, and one in NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde - but the other point is still being considered. Alison Jackson, from South Derbyshire, struggled to walk following her mesh repair Alison Jackson, from Swadlincote in South Derbyshire, used to be a keen runner, but after having mesh fitted she could hardly walk. Two weeks ago, she had her implant removed at one of the new centres, and would like to see more people benefit. ""The referral process should be easier and there should be more sites, though only if there are enough surgeons with the right expertise,"" she said. ""Mesh removal is like getting chewing gum out of hair. I know women who have been left with permanent nerve damage. There's no guarantee I will get better, but any improvement is a good thing."" Alison also wants the specialist services to be extended to all mesh-injured patients, such as hernia and rectopexy. Twelve months after the Cumberlege review was released, the chair of the Association for Children Damaged by Hormone Pregnancy Tests says she's losing confidence the government will make all of the recommendations law. Marie Lyon was prescribed Primodos. Marie Lyon was prescribed primodos and later gave birth to a daughter whose limbs were not fully formed. ""It will all be down to money and what can they get away with,"" she says. ""That is betraying all future patients of the NHS, which is a disgrace.""

Review urges more funding for drug user treatments,"The government has been urged to boost spending on recovery services and treatment for drug addicts by an independent review. The report by Dame Carol Black said cuts have left services ""on their knees"" and urged an extra Â£552m investment over five years in England. It also advised a Â£15m boost towards jobs support for those in treatment. Health Secretary Sajid Javid said ministers would ""look closely"" at the recommendations. The government has announced it will follow one of the recommendations, to set up a new cross-government unit on tackling drug misuse. Mr Javid said it would ensure ""strong collaboration"" on the issue, which is the shared responsibility of several different departments. Focus on drug users' recovery not crime - review Â£80m for treatment services in drug crackdown Young drug users offered support over prosecution The report is the second part of a two-stage review originally commissioned by Mr Javid in February 2019, when he was home secretary. The first part, published in February last year, estimated the drugs trade in Englandcost society about Â£19bn a year. The second part, which focuses on treatment services, found ""vital services"" have been cut back, with support workers ""depleted"" and ""demoralised"". Dame Carol, a medic and government health adviser between 2006 and 2016, said this included specialist services for young people, detox treatment in hospitals, and rehab programmes in specialist facilities. Speaking on Radio 4's Today programme, she said people dependent on drugs were stigmatised when they should be treated as having a chronic health condition, in the same way as someone with diabetes. She said a change of attitude and culture was needed so that when an addict completes a treatment programme, they are given ongoing support, rather than being discharged immediately with no follow up care. Lena Larsen from Merseyside says she became addicted to heroin ""within a few days"" after she started taking it aged 19. The 46-year old says she managed to stop taking the drug in 2002 without going through any recovery treatment, but later started using again after entering an abuse relationship. ""Although I'd stopped the drugs, I hadn't changed anything,"" she says. ""For eight years I managed, but I'd not changed."" She adds she had ""never heard of recovery"" before a friend took her to a women's refuge and she started attending a specialist centre. She adds that two and a half years later, her life is ""so much different from what it was"". She recently came off methadone, a heroin substitute, and also volunteers at the centre, helping other problem drug users. ""You need to engage in something, whatever route it is,"" she says. ""Putting the drugs down, that's easy, but you need to get involved in whatever it isâ¦ putting the drugs down isn't enough."" Dame Carol said many drug addicts committed minor crimes and then ended up in prison. She said: ""I'm calling for there to be consideration within the criminal justice system and the probation system to think about diversion. ""We know that we used to have many more people diverted into appropriate treatment. ""The numbers have decreased because we don't have the quality and the quantity of treatment to permit this to happen with good results."" Nic Adamson, the executive director of drug recovery organisation Change, Grow, Live welcomed the idea of a more health-based approach. She said: ""Drug use doesn't come in isolation, it's part of a much broader societal issue in relation to deprivation and poverty and the broader range of health issues that come with it. ""Talking about it as a health condition means it's much easier for us to access the broader range of help that people need."" Dame Carol said a recent pledge tospend an extra Â£80mon treatments in England was welcome, but should lead to further spending pledges this autumn. And she welcomed the announcement by ministers of  a Joint Combating Drugs Unit as providing ""a very fair chance to deliver"" on her recommendations. Dame Carol's review also called for: funding to set up a new professional body for drugs treatment professionals funding for ""peer mentors"" in job centres to encourage drug addicts to access employment support ensuring everyone leaving prison has ID and a bank account, so they can access the benefits system a fund to research which measures work best at changing the behaviour of ""recreational"" drug users The Local Government Association, which represents council leaders in England, said funding for treatment services had ""not kept pace with demand"". Drug-related deaths in England and Wales reached their highest level since records began in 2019, the last year for which figures are available. This marks a 52% increase in drug-related deaths in the past 10 years. In total, there were 4,393 drug poisoning deaths, of which about two thirds (2,883) were related to ""drug misuse,""according to the Office for National Statistics,external. The rest include accidents and suicides.

Your coronavirus updates for this busy Thursday have been brought to you by Jo Couzens, Mary O'Connor, Jennifer Meierhans, Owen Amos, Alex Kleiderman and James Clarke. Our live updates on coronavirus are coming to an end soon so here's a recap on the day's news. The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned the third wave of coronavirus cases facing Africa could get worse as new and faster spreading variants drive infections. The highly transmissible Delta variant first identified in India is spreading to more and more countries. New weekly cases have now overtaken the highest weekly numbers recorded during the peak of the second wave in January this year. Meanwhile, only slightly more than 1% of the continent has been fully vaccinated. New cases have been increasing for seven weeks running and rose by an average of 28% week-on-week over the past month, according to the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The WHO says more than 251,000 new cases were recorded in the week ending 4 July, making it the ""worst pandemic week ever"". There are 23 countries on the continent that have so far experienced a third wave of infections, including Senegal and Malawi. Uganda, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Namibia, Zambia, Rwanda and Tunisia have been among the worst hit by a recent resurgence in infections. South Africa is also reporting a sustained increase in cases, with Gauteng province, where Johannesburg is located, leading with infections. You can read Reality Check's full analysis of the situationhere. Health boards in Scotland should consider cancelling non-urgent procedures to reduce pressure on hospitals, a senior public health official has said. Jillian Evans, head of health intelligence at NHS Grampian, said it would ""make sense"" to defer some operations. It comes after two hospitals reachedfull capacity in the north east. NHS Lanarkshire and NHS Highland have also reported pressure on services in recent days. And NHS Highland cancelled all non-urgent elective surgery and most outpatient activity at Inverness' Raigmore Hospital amid growing pressure. The health boards said self-isolation requirements meant that a number of staff who were double vaccinated had to stay off after being in contact with the virus outside of work. Read morehere. The latest map from the EUâs disease monitoring agency, the
ECDC, shows the EUâs new Covid hotspots: Portugal, Spain and Cyprus. Most parts of those countries have infection rates above 120
per 100,000 people, registered over the past 14 days. The more contagious Delta variant is
responsible for this, health officials say. Spainâs infection rate nationally has more than doubled in a
week, to 252 cases per 100,000. The highest rate is in the
20-29 age group, most of whom have not been vaccinated. Spain's Catalonia region has reimposed curbs on nightlife and Portugal has reintroduced night curfews. France has warned its citizens against travel to those countries. You
can see the ECDCâs latest datain full here.,external The National Education Union is calling on ministers to urgently set out the potential negative health repercussions of easing Covid restrictions in England's schools and schools this autumn. In a letter to Education Secretary Gavin Williamson, the joint general secretaries of the UK's largest teaching union, Mary Bousted and Kevin Courtney, point out that Covid infections could rise again as schools reopen in September, if the government's policy is based ""just on hope"". It comes after Williamson said the system of sending ""bubbles"" of children home after a positive casewould cease at the end of summer term. The bubble system had been necessary to limit virus spread but was now causing disruption to pupils' lives, he added. It comes as figures revealeda sharp rise in the number of pupils being sent home from school in Englanddue to Covid. The NEU's letter adds: ""We are asking these questions because we believe that should cases continue to rise, with negative health consequences in the autumn term, that you have a plan and can act quickly and decisively."" Coronavirus is continuing to spread around the world, with more than 180 million infections and four million deaths recorded across nearly 200 countries. Confirmed cases have been rising steeply since the middle of last year, but the true extent of the first outbreaks in 2020 is unclear because testing was not then widely available. Deaths have also been rising, however official figures may not fully reflect the true number in many countries. Several coronavirus vaccines have been approved for use, either by individual countries or groups of countries, such as the European Union and the World Health Organization (WHO). Some 193 countries and territories have been administering vaccines and publishing rollout data. Take a look at the charts below for more detail on the coronavirus picture around the world. As the UK passes the five million mark for coronavirus cases confirmed through a positive test the government is braced for a surge in new infections after restrictions are eased in England - likely to be on 19 July. Earlier this week Health Secretary Sajid Javid said new coronavirus cases âcould go as high as 100,000â per day, after social distancing rules end. But yesterday, the prime minister defended the government's approach to easing England's lockdown, saying the link between infection and serious disease and death has been ""severed"". Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions, Boris Johnson said: ""Currently there are only a 30th of the deaths that we were seeing at an equivalent position in previous waves of this pandemic."" The government's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance was more cautious, saying vaccines had ""weakened the link between cases and hospitalisations, but it's a weakened link, not a completely broken link"". Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, China Media Analyst Taiwanâs Central Epidemic Command Centre (CECC) has announced that from next week, a number of restrictions will be lifted as cases
of Covid-19 continue to fall. Restaurants, night markets and food courts will be allowed to open
for indoor dining from 13 July, provided they comply with CECC social
distancing guidelines,the Taiwan News website reports.,external Art galleries, museums and cinemas will also be allowed to open,
as well as most indoor and outdoor sports venues. However, visitors must comply
with local track and trace procedures,comply with social distancing and wear a mask where appropriate.,external In the past 24 hours, Taiwan has recorded18 new cases of Covid-19, and three deaths.,externalTodayâs statistics are on par with those recorded in early May, before the
islandwent into near lockdown due to a spike in cases. Taiwan has four Covid-19 response levels, with Level 4 being a
full, national lockdown. Level 3 mean all non-essential businesses are
closed and a mask-mandate is in place. These rules have been in place since 15
May in New Taipei and Taipei City, and nationally since 20 May. They will continue to be in place until at least 26 July, meaning many other venues, including schools, bars and clubs, will remain closed
until at least then. Travel bosses have cautiously welcomed the announcement that fully vaccinated travellers returning from amber-list countries will not have to self-isolate after 19 July. But EasyJet boss Johan Lundgren said he did not want to see ""a return to flying being a preserve of the rich"". ""Expensive testing could sadly make travel out of reach for some,"" he said. Airlines and airports said millions of people could have a more normal summer, but the government should do more. The need to quarantine on return had hindered a travel industry recovery. Under previous rules, those returning to Britain from its top destinations, Spain, France, the US and Italy, all had to self-isolate for up to 10 days. Read the full story and more industry reactionhere. Covid infection rates across all regions of England are at their highest level since at least February, according to Public Health England's latest surveillance report. The highest case rate is being seen in north-east England, with 613.4 cases per 100,000 people in the week to 4 July. It is the highest figure for the region since like for like figures began in the summer of last year, as mass testing was rolled out across the country. Meanwhile, all the other regions are seeing their highest rate since late January or early February - with the exception of Yorkshire and the Humber where the rate is the highest since mid-November last year. Today's number of new positive coronavirus tests has pushed the UK total over the course of the pandemic, by that measure, to more than five million. The UK reported 32,551 new infections in the last 24 hours, up from 32,548 yesterday when it was the first day that cases rose above 30,000 since 24 January. This means the total number of positive tests for the coronavirus in the UK, according to the government data, is 5,022,893. But in the early days of the pandemic last year when it was harder to get a test, many people would have been likely to have had the virus but not tested positive for it - so the total number of cases could never be known and may be a fair bit higher. Just over a quarter of a million coronavirus vaccinations were given in the UK yesterday - 86,953 first doses and 171,477 second jabs. The UK has now given a total of 79,800,224 coronavirus vaccinations,according to the government's daily statistics.,external That's 45,601,445 first doses and 34,198,779 second doses. The rules onforeign travelandself-isolationare soon going to change for people who have had both jabs. There have been a further 35 coronavirus-related deaths in the UK,according to the government's daily figures.,external This brings the total number of people to die within 28 days of a positive Covid test to 128,336. There were also another 32,551 new cases recorded in the past 24 hours. The Shearwater field is east of Aberdeen More than 80 people have been flown ashore from a North Sea oil and gas platform following a Covid outbreak. Fifteen positive cases have been identified on the Safe Zephyrus floating hotel next to the Shell-owned Shearwater platform in the past week. Shell says those who tested positive along with 70 identified close contacts have been removed from the facility, 140 miles (225km) east of Aberdeen. The company says there has been no disruption to production. More than 60 people wereflown ashore from the Shearwater field in Aprilafter a Covid outbreak. Read more on this storyhere. Caroline DaviesTransport correspondent For the first time in a while,
travel bosses are relatively pleased. Todayâs announcement is a big change,
opening up international travel far more significantly that has been possible
this year. However, there are limitations. This policy only applies to those
jabbed in the UK, meaning those jabbed abroad will still have to quarantine if
coming from an amber list country. That will affect some family and friends
hoping to reunite and impact on businesses that rely on international visitors
who wonât see those customers return in the same numbers as UK travellers will
leave. Tests are still required from
green and amber list countries. The cost will dissuade some from travelling. Crucially, this rule is just
about what happens when people travel to the UK - whether other countries will
let UK travellers in is a different matter altogether. Earlier, we reported that Japan had declared a state of emergency in Tokyo to combat coronavirus - measures that will be in place during the Olympic Games later this month. We've since got more detail on what that will mean, with Olympics Minister Tamayo Marukawa announcing the Games will happen without spectators following discussions today with officials and organisers. Bars and restaurants will not be allowed to serve alcohol and must close by 20:00 (11:00 GMT). After meeting government officials, Tokyo 2020 President Seiko Hashimoto says: ""It is regrettable that we are delivering the Games in a very limited format, facing the spread of coronavirus infections. ""I am sorry to those who purchased tickets and everyone in local areas."" The Olympic Games are scheduled to take place in the Japanese capital between 23 July and 8 August. There has been widespread opposition to the Games in Japan, with calls for them to be postponed or cancelled. You can read morehere. Today's announcement on travel ""finally signals"" a meaningful restart to international travels and is the news that UK holidaymakers have been looking forward to, says Jet2's boss. Chief executive Steve Heapy says: ""Instead of a handful of destinations to choose from, this news means our customers can plan and look forward to flights and holidays across 40 green and amber list destinations this summer."" He says: ""With the government looking to unlock restrictions from 19 July, we have been calling for international travel not to be left behind, so this is an extremely positive step forward for the travel industry."" Heapy looks forward to the Scottish and Northern Ireland governments ""following suit"", he says. Meanwhile, the UK Chamber of Shipping Chief Executive Bob Sanguinetti says: âMillions of people enjoy travelling by ferry and we are pleased to see that entry restrictions are being eased for UK nationals who have been fully vaccinated. ""This is a positive step in the right direction and this decision will benefit our ferry members and their passengers who can now book their travel with much greater confidence."" You can read more reaction to the new travel ruleshere. As coronavirus cases continue to rise in England, the number of exposure alerts sent to users of the NHS Covid-19 app has risen by more than 60%, according to the latest contact tracing figures. A total of 356,036 alerts were sent to users of the app in England in the week to June 30, telling them they had been in close contact with someone who had tested positive for coronavirus. This is up from 219,391 the previous week - a jump of 62% - and is the highest weekly figure since data was first published in January. Ministers have been warned that millions of people could be ""pinged"" by the app or ordered to self-isolate by Test and Trace, with infections expected to hit around 100,000 cases a day in the summer. Earlier, Chancellor Rishi Sunak had acknowledged public ""frustration"" and said that Health Secretary Sajid Javid is looking at an ""appropriate, balanced and proportionate"" approach for the app. Read more:Millions could be self-isolating between now and 16 August Heathrow Airport boss John Holland-Kaye has welcomed the change in rules for UK residents returning from amber-list countries - but says the ""job isn't done"". Following the transport secretary's announcement, he says: ""This is excellent news that will give a much-needed boost to millions of people across Britain looking forward to a more normal summer and reuniting with family and friends abroad."" Holland-Kaye says ""Global Britain needs to get trading again"", adding: ""US business can get to the EU, but the UK remains cut off."" The airport's chief executive says the UK should open up travel to fully-vaccinated people from more countries - particularly key partners in the US - by the end of July, adding: ""If the EU can do it, so can the UK."" He says the airport isworking closely with British Airways and Virgin Atlanticto demonstrate changes can happen safely, with checks on departure, and no need for delays at immigration on arrival.

Travel changes for double-jabbed to be set out,"Details about how and when fully vaccinated travellers can return from certain countries without having to quarantine are to be set out later. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps will make a statement to MPs this morning. Currently, those arriving in the UK have to follow strict rules regardless of their vaccine status, and anyone returning from countries on the amber or red list must isolate for 10 days. Travel bosses have called for the rules to be eased as soon as possible. The UK'straffic light system for international travelis still in force. Fewer than 30 destinations are on the green list - meaning travellers do not have to self-isolate when they get back to the UK but they do have to pay for Covid tests. More than 50 countries are on the strictest red list, which requires arrivals to pay to self-isolate in a hotel for 10 days. But most places - including several holiday hotspots such as mainland Spain, Greece and the US - are on the amber list. People returning from these countries must quarantine for 10 days and pay for tests. What are the green, amber and red rules? How can I prove I've had both my Covid jabs? The rules for holiday spots like Portugal, Malta and Spain The government has already said it was planning to scrap the need to quarantine for those who are double-jabbed and returning from amber countries. But it has not set out how it would work, when it would happen, and whether unvaccinated children would also be able to avoid quarantine if their parents are fully vaccinated. In addition to relaxing the rules around isolation for travellers, Chancellor Rishi Sunak told the BBC that the health secretary was considering a ""more proportionate and balanced approach"" to isolation for Covid contacts. It comes amid fears that surging cases across the UK will lead to millions of people being asked to self-isolate during the summer, even if they have been fully vaccinated. ""I recognise people's frustrations with this. I have spoken to the health secretary and he's also aware of this,"" Mr Sunak told BBC Breakfast. ""He's looking at the difference between the two systems [contact tracers and the NHS app] and seeing what might be a more proportionate and balanced approach to this."" The transport secretary's travel update in the House of Commons is due at 11:30 BST. The UK government's traffic light system applies toEngland,,externalwithScotland,external,Wales,externalandNorthern Ireland,externalable to make their own rules. However, the rules are broadly the same and previous changes to the lists have been adopted by all four nations. Melanie's husband was diagnosed with cancer last summer Melanie Matheis lives in California. Her daughter Allana left to go to drama school in London in September, and a few months later Melanie's husband died after being diagnosed with cancer. Allana couldn't come back for her father's funeral or for Christmas because of the UK's travel restrictions. ""She wouldn't have been able to go back to school when she went back to London because of the quarantine,"" Melanie tells the BBC, ""so she made the difficult decision to stay there."" She adds: ""It was difficult for myself as well being alone."" Melanie is double-jabbed and was hoping to visit her daughter in London this month, but has put it back by a few weeks once it became clear the rules were not changing. The US is on the UK's amber list, meaning Melanie would have to quarantine somewhere when she arrives. Without a home here, she would have to pay for a hotel room and tests which she can't afford. ""It would be double the expense and it's just not really possible,"" she says. ""It would make it very difficult."" The travel industry is eager to have the rules relaxed. Daniel Pearce, the head of Travel Trade Gazette, a monthly magazine for the travel industry, said the industry had been ""crying out"" for quarantine exemptions. He said he hoped changes would coincide with the wider easingof lockdown rules in England on 19 July., as that would allow the travel industry to capitalise on the family summer holiday market. ""Any change as early as this would enable some form of summer season to take place during the children's school holidays,"" he said. However, other groups are concerned about the plan to open up society further. In a letter to medical journal The Lancet,,externalmore than 120 scientists and doctors have called on the UK government to rethink its plan to end restrictions in England on 19 July, calling it ""dangerous and premature"", saying millions more people will became infected if it goes ahead. The government should wait until everyone, including adolescents, have been offered the vaccine before opening up, they say. The traffic light system sets the rules travellers must follow on their return. But holidaymakers also need tocheck their destination's entry rules. For example, all non-vaccinated travellers to mainlandPortugalneed a negative Covid test, and must quarantine for 14 days. Twelve to 17-year-olds travelling with fully-vaccinated parents don't have to quarantine but need a negative test. Under-11s are exempt. Only fully-vaccinated adults can travel toMalta, and don't need a negative test. Children aged 5-11 can travel with fully-vaccinated adults, but need a negative test. Under-5s don't need a test. Unvaccinated 12 to 17-year olds can't enter. Over-12s travelling toSpainneed a negative test or proof of vaccination. Unvaccinated travellers can only enterFrancefor ""essential reasons"", and must self-isolate for seven days. Fully-vaccinated adults with a negative test can enter. Under-18s travelling with fully-vaccinated adults don't need to self-isolate. More than 32,000 new coronavirus caseswere announced on Wednesday,,externalas well as 33 more deaths. Nearly two-thirds of the adult population in the UK have received two jabs, and 86% have had a first dose. Prof Andrew Hayward, a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), which advises ministers, stressed it was ""still very important"" to try to control the Delta variant, despite the success of the vaccine rollout. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""If we abandon general population social distancing measures as a means of control, then we will very likely see a massive peak of infections and, whilst the vaccines are excellent, they're not perfect. ""And so, if we get to a very small percentage of a massive number of cases getting hospitalised, that's still a very large number."" The government has said that public health remains its priority and it is taking a cautious approach to the resumption of international travel.

"Backlash against longer hours for lorry driversGrant Shapps says the move will ease a driver shortage, but the industry calls it a sticking plaster.","A temporary extension of lorry drivers' working hours has been met with backlash from the industry who say the government is applying a ""sticking plaster"" to driver shortage problems. HGV drivers can increase their daily driving limits from nine to 10 hours or change weekly rest patterns on Monday. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said the move would give flexibility to drivers to make slightly longer trips. But the Road Haulage Association said the move wouldn't make any difference. The RHA believes there is currently a shortfall of about 60,000 lorry drivers and said the relaxation on driving hour limits was a ""sticking plaster"". It estimates that some 30,000 HGV driving tests did not take place last year because of the Covid pandemic. ""Relaxing drivers' hours won't make any material difference - and fails to address the underlying issues, which require a package of measures to fix,"" the RHA said. The national officer for road transport at Unite the union, Adrian Jones, also said the announcement would do nothing to resolve the problem of driver shortages. He added: ""Unite will be advising its members to not place themselves in danger and that if they are too tired to drive safely, they have a legal right to refuse to do so. ""Unite will fully support those who make that decision, legally and industrially."" Logistics UK, which represents freight businesses, said longer hours would ""heap more pressure on drivers who are already stretched to the limit to deliver"". James Firth, of Logistics UK, said the industry ""vehemently opposed the extension"" and said the government had ""ignored the will of those who will be most affected by the changes"". ""Existing drivers have been working flat out since the start of the pandemic, and this could be the final straw for many of them,"" he said. ""Instead of trying to paper over the gaps, government should be working with industry to produce a plan to support moving drivers through the current bottleneck of HGV driving tests."" Where have all the UK workers gone? Businesses and union officials have warned that the driver shortage jeopardises deliveries to supermarkets and other sectors of the economy. The haulage industry is one of a number of sectors having trouble finding suitable staff as the economy reopens, leading some experts to talk of the UK's missing workers. Among those worried isGerman confectionery giant Haribo, which has said it is struggling to deliver its sweets to shops in the UK. Mr Shapps said the government had ""ramped up"" the number of driving tests available and would consider other measures. The government said driver safety must not be compromised and operators must notify the Department for Transport if the relaxation is used. The RHA's chief executive, Richard Burnett, said it opposed wholesale extensions to drivers' hours, believing they could be counter-productive by making the job less attractive. ""Loading more hours on to drivers that are already exhausted is not the answer - the problem needs more than just a sticking plaster,"" he added. ""Ministers should be mindful that road safety is the reason HGV drivers' hours are limited. Relaxing them should only be used as a last resort to resolve short-term issues that cannot be addressed in other ways."" Mr Burnett said that as the shortage worsened, drivers' pay rates were going up, often substantially. ""Suppliers and retailers should be prepared that these additional costs will be passed on,"" he added. A government spokesperson said it had ""already taken action on HGV driver shortages, including ramping up vocational test capacity, and funding apprenticeships"". ""Most of the solutions, however, are likely to be driven by industry, with progress already being made in testing and hiring, and a big push towards improving pay, working conditions and diversity,"" they added.

England into first major men's final since 1966 - reaction,"England reach first ever men's Euros final & first men's major tournament final since 1966 England play Italy in Sunday's final at Wembley Shamoon Hafez Ben in Scarborough:I think those last 4 mins were the best football we've ever played!!!! We really looked like a team that knew how to win, not scared to lose. Awesome. Andy in Tavistock:Is this real? We are in the final?? An ecstatic feeling. My throat has gone... wowzers! Gary Redwin:Happy tears after too many years of hurt but also well played Denmark. Roll on Sunday. Daniel Johnson:I didnât cry when my daughters were born. I cried tonight. Thank you England. Tommy G:This is crazy. Just crazy. We are in a final. After the pens of 90, 96, 98, 04 and 06. Ronaldinho in 02. The sheer underwhelmingness (a word?) of everything thing else until Russia. And now this. Ruddy hell. A happy 40 year old I am. England 2-1 Denmark Our fixture list has updated for Sunday. It's now official. Lineker has nailed it with that last entry, he is spot on. So much has gone against England over the years in major tournaments, but it now feels different. It might just be coming home. England 2-1 Denmark Gary LinekerEx-England striker on BBC One It's been a long time coming. It's finally happened. I was doubting I'd ever see it again in my lifetime at one point. The longer the game went on, the more England looked likely to score, even though you have those self-doubts. There was about two or three minutes at the end where England were passing it around and keeping the ball. They were singing ""ole"" at Wembley Stadium in the semi-final of a major tournament! I've been around, watched tournaments and played in tournaments over the years and so many things have gone wrong - the 'Hand of God', Frank Lampard's goal, Chris Waddle hitting the inside of the post, it being a quarter of an inch away from Gazza's studs. We have seen big injuries to big players prior to tournaments but in this one, England just seem to have had a bit of luck for once! You need that to win a tournament. FT: England 2-1 Denmark Jermaine JenasFormer England midfielder on BBC One Going into extra time and running at full speed, full pace - Raheem Sterlingâs facing defenders up saying Iâm going to go by you again, when youâre
a defender that is hell and at that point in the game your legs are burning and
heâs just looking at them saying Iâm going to take you apart and he did it on
the right-wing and he did it on the left-wing. As far as performances go in an
England shirt it was right up there - itâs a special moment for him. FT: England 2-1 Denmark Alan ShearerFormer England striker on BBC One You don't achieve what Southgate has achieved in his career without having a tough streak, without being able to make big decisions. He has been a captain in every dressing room he has been in. He had to take off Jack Grealish today because it is clear he doesn't trust Grealish defensively. That worked, because then Denmark couldn't get the ball, England passed the ball. I lost count of the number of passes. England 2-1 Denmark Metro Scotland have taken England's victory well... FT: England 2-1 Denmark Jermaine JenasFormer England midfielder on BBC One The lads what
they did best was dealing with the pressure of the moment when Denmark were
going well. The way they responded all day to everything was absolutely spot on. You have to give Gareth Southgate credit,
he knows within his arsenal he has some incredible players but there were some
moments where he lets some players loose when he brought on Jack Grealish and Phil
Foden and put Raheem Sterling on the right they went out there with freedom and
thatâs why theyâve got the result tonight. FT: England 2-1 Denmark Alan ShearerFormer England striker on BBC One England have shown character in abundance. After three or four minutes we was saying Denmark are a really good team, they were popping it around, working hard and causing England problems. Then they got the goal, and England had to dig deep. They scored at the right time just before half-time which would have given them a little bit of confidence. FT: England 2-1 Denmark ""England make history."" ""Kane you believe it!"" ""Andfinally!"" ""The history boys."" ""Finally."" FT: England 2-1 Denmark Alan ShearerFormer England striker on BBC One We were screaming, what a night what a performance. It was hard work, it was very different to the other performances they have put in. But they have shown a great side to their game tonight, in coming back from conceding their first goal. FT: England 2-1 Denmark ITV Former England striker Ian Wright on ITV:""I still feel like Raheem Sterling is going to be
a key man, of course Harry Kane took the penalty and scored but Sterling is
still going to a key man and I think he is the one that Italy will be worried
about."" FT: England 2-1 Denmark Denmark Denmark coachKasper Hjulmand:""Obviously, it's a big disappointment that we're so close to the final, and different circumstances during the match mean that we're not taking the last step. ""It has been amazing what the boys have done. There's a fantastic power within these guys. They play football in a fantastic way. ""We've been attacking, scoring goals and showed our true selves. The players just went on with everything they have â both off and on the pitch."" FT: England 2-1 Denmark ITV Former England right back Gary Neville on ITV: ""Harry Kane needs to rest up, he has got Chiellini and Bonucci
all night, he is the type of player they will fancy playing against, a physical
contest. It will be a really tough test, you are not going to get an easy match
in the final. ""Italy have grown into the tournament better than I thought they
would. We have seen a lot over the years about possession football, but two
teams who have been more methodical has made the final. ""England have been a good team, one goal conceded in six
matches is outstanding, Southgate set his stall out at the start of this
tournament. The only way we was going to get to a final was keeping clean
sheets."" England 2-1 Denmark Go on. England 2-1 Denmark England England boss Gareth Southgate to BBC Sport:""The experiences the group have had really shone through tonight, we knew we wouldn't go through a tournament without conceding, but tonight it was our night. ""You can only gain confidence by the evidence of your results and performances. The more experiences like this - they are reference points for the team. We know we have one enormous hurdle to come but tonight they should enjoy it, they should be very proud. ""This tournament we've been adaptable and we've changed at the right times. Now we have a real challenge in the final. ""It was mayhem on the pitch at full-time. As soon as Sweet Caroline was playing that was it. They know how much tonight will have taken out of them. Italy are a day ahead in their preparation and we have to be spot on. ""I'm just so pleased for our country. The atmosphere, I don't think I've heard the new Wembley like that. It's only topped the Germany game really. We know what our country like others has been through and to continue that happiness and journey for anther four days, we're so happy. FT: England 2-1 Denmark ITV Former England striker Ian Wright on ITV:""I wasn't surprised Saka came off because that has been the pattern of Gareth, He's started him, he stretches the team goes at the defenders and then he brings on Jack Grealish. ""I feel for Jack Grealish you can see its a tournament that he really wants to be a part of, every time he gets going it doesnt quite happen for him. To be taken off like that is of course, you subbed a sub its not nice. ""But it is about the squad and being a part of it. Sunday Jack might come on and make a massive difference, he might set up the winning goal."" #bbcfootball Tommy G:This is crazy. Just crazy. We are in a final. After the pens of 90, 96, 98, 04 and 06. Ronaldinho in 02. The sheer underwhelmingness (a word?) of everything thing else until Russia. And now this. Ruddy hell. A happy 40 year old I am. England 2-1 Denmark Raheem Sterling was close to converting... FT: England 2-1 Denmark ITV Former England right back Gary Neville on ITV:""There's been moments before games where Southgate has been questioned and had it gone wrong he would have been battered. He has done thing his way all the way through the tournament. ""There is no ego in that dressing room and he will make the decisions that are best for the team."" Â© 2025 BBC.
