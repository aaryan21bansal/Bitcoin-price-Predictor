PM calls for resolve to fight Covid over winter,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson said that collective health depends on ""individual behaviour"" Prime Minister Boris Johnson has called on the public to ""summon the discipline and the resolve"" to follow the new coronavirus rules announced on Tuesday. In a television broadcast to the country he warned the government may go further if people do not stick to them. Mr Johnson said while the vast majority have complied with the measures so far, ""there have been too many breaches"". New restrictions were announced across the UK earlier, with Mr Johnson warning rules could last for up to six months. In England,,externalrules on face coverings have been expanded and the number of people allowed at weddings has been halved. Pubs, restaurants and other hospitality venues will have to close by 22:00 BST, while the fines for breaking the rules will also increase to Â£200 on the first offence. Hospitality venues will also have to close early in Scotland and Wales - but Scotlandhas gone further, banning people from visiting other people's homes. Northern Irelandhas also already bannedhouseholds mixing indoors. It comes as the number of UK cases rose by 4,926 on Tuesday,government figures showed,external, with deaths increasing by 37. Boris Johnson's statement in full How have the rules changed? How many cases are there in your area? Where do I have to wear a face covering now? Speaking on Tuesday evening, Mr Johnson explained the new measures, saying they were ""robust but proportionate"". ""And to those who say we don't need this stuff, and we should leave people to take their own risks, I say these risks are not our own,"" he said. ""The tragic reality of having Covid is that your mild cough can be someone else's death knell. ""And as for the suggestion that we should simply lock up the elderly and the vulnerable - with all the suffering that would entail - I must tell you that this is just not realistic, because if you let the virus rip through the rest of the population it would inevitably find its way through to the elderly as well, and in much greater numbers."" Mr Johnson said he was ""deeply, spiritually reluctant"" to infringe on anyone's freedom, but added: ""Unless we take action the risk is that we will have to go for tougher measures later."" ""If people don't follow the rules we have set out, then we must reserve the right to go further,"" he added. More police will be put on the streets and the Army will be used as back-up if need be, he said. ""If we follow these simple rules together, we will get through this winter together,"" he added. ""There are unquestionably difficult months to come. ""And the fight against Covid is by no means over. I have no doubt, however, that there are great days ahead. ""But now is the time for us all to summon the discipline, and the resolve, and the spirit of togetherness that will carry us through."" This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""It would be tempting to think the threat had faded"" In her statement on Tuesday evening, Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: ""In a global pandemic of a virus with as yet no vaccine, we simply can't have 100% normality. No country can. So we must choose our priorities."" She said that although ""today must feel like a step backwards"", the country is ""in a much stronger position than in the spring"". ""It won't last forever and one day, hopefully soon, we will be looking back on it, not living through it,"" she said. And she added: ""I will never find the words to thank all of you enough for the enormous sacrifices you have made so far. And I am sorry to be asking for more."" Meanwhile, Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford said: ""In the weeks and months ahead of us, there is a very real possibility we could see coronavirus regain a foothold in our local communities, towns and cities. None of us wants to see that happen again"". And Northern Ireland's First Minister Arlene Foster has said tougher restrictions being imposed in the nationdo not represent a second lockdown but should act as a ""wake-up call"". A televised address from the prime minister is not the rarity it once was, but it's still a big moment. The coronavirus pandemic has required Boris Johnson to appeal directly to the public on more than one occasion. The gravity of the situation is such that, his argument goes, a renewed national effort is required to bring the virus back under control. Behind the echoes of wartime rhetoric and Johnsonian linguistic flourishes was a simple message; stick with it for six months and we'll get through this. But as he acknowledged, there are some who say he's taking the wrong decisions and the public's patience for further restrictions may not be what it was six months ago. There was optimism that better days lay ahead but a vaccine and mass testing were ""hopes and dreams"" not the reality, not now. Scotland's First Minister had gone further so comparisons will be inevitable; which tactics will work? While England and the UK's nerve is being tested again, so too is the prime minister and the government's leadership and its strategy. THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters LOCAL LOCKDOWNS:What happens if you have one? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? WEDDINGS:Can I have a reception with guests? SOCIAL LIFE:Is it safe to go to the pub? Earlier, Mr Johnson told MPs that the new rules were ""carefully judged"" to achieve the maximum reduction in the R number - which measures how quickly the virus is spreading - while causing ""the minimum damage to lives and livelihoods"". If these restrictions fail to bring the R number below one - the point where the epidemic is no longer growing - ""then we reserve the right to deploy greater fire power with significantly greater restrictions"" he said. Thelatest R estimate for the whole of the UK is between 1.1 and 1.4. Weddings: 'We have to phone 15 people and un-invite them' Analysis: Last throw of dice before the really tough call Mr Johnson said that unless progress was made, people should assume the restrictions would remain in place ""for perhaps six months"". But Ms Sturgeon said the rules in Scotland would ""not necessarily"" be in place for as long as six months - and would be reviewed every three weeks. Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth told the BBC the new restrictions could have been avoided if the government ""fixed testing and tracing"". Mr Ashworth said Labour supported the new measures but that ""we shouldn't have been here"". ""So what we need to do now is drive infections down, we all need to follow the rules, but the government in return have really got to fix this testing system and this tracing system, and give people the support when they need to isolate."" In England: Office workersare being toldto work from home again if possible Penalties for not wearing a mask or gathering in groups of more than six willincrease to Â£200on the first offence From Thursday 24 September, all pubs, bars and restaurants will be restricted totable service only.

'We have to un-invite 15 people',"Tony and Laura have a daughter together and another baby on the way ""We have to phone 15 people and tell them they can't come any more, which is an absolute nightmare,"" says Tony Slade, who is due to get married to fiancee Laura next week. They had already limited their wedding guest list to fewer than 30, in line with the UK government's coronavirus restrictions in England. Now they face a further cull, asBoris Johnson announcedthe maximum number of people allowed at weddings is being cut to 15. ""More than likely we'll probably still go ahead with it,"" says Tony, from Edenbridge in Kent. ""It'll be Laura's family of six and my family of five."" The couple - who have been together for 10 years and have a daughter together - will ""have a long chat about what to do this evening"" and make a decision. ""I don't know how you can have pubs but you can't have weddings,"" he says. ""I understand there's certain things they've got to do but I don't think they're looking at it in the right way. ""You can sit in a Wetherspoons with 100 people back to back but you can't have more than 15 at a wedding, even spaced out."" He adds: ""I'm disappointed. Laura's done all the planning in record time. She had about six of her mates who were bridesmaids who can't come now. My best man and groomsmen can't come either."" What are the rules on weddings? The story of a socially distanced wedding New rules at-a-glance: More face coverings and fines The new rules have not been published yet - but if they are similar tothe current regulations,,externalthe limit will have to include all attendees - including the registrar and suppliers such as photographers. Amy and her fiance Alan are also facing the prospect of having to send out another batch of ""uninvites"" to their wedding. The couple, who live in Cheltenham, originally cut down their wedding guest list of 100 to fewer than 30. ""Upset was the first feeling I had,"" says Amy, of the moment when Mr Johnson announced the rules. ""We had got very excited about our new plan which we just made about three weeks ago. To cut it down again is another blow."" Amy and fiance Alan did not want to be identified ""I don't understand how it fits with the other regulations,"" she says. ""Maybe I can understand them cutting down the reception, but the ceremony as well? Why does that have to be 15 when a church service can have as many as they want?"" Under the current rules,,externalplaces of worship can decide their own limits for services - but not weddings - depending on how many people can safely fit inside while social distancing. With her wedding in one month's time, on 23 October, Amy, 35, who is a teacher, isn't sure what she and her fiance will do, and says they will discuss it properly before deciding. ""People have booked their travel,"" she says, with some guests due to travel from Northern Ireland. ""That's the problem."" Some couples are determined to go ahead with their plans despite the new limit, not wanting to put their lives on hold. ""We just want to get married,"" says James Hoggarth, a chartered accountant from Leamington Spa, who has been engaged to fiancee Lindsay for two years. ""We have already got one child, we want to have another one at some point."" ""It is what it is,"" says James - ""it is the hand that we have been dealt"" They originally had 110 guests planned for their wedding next month, which they then cut down to 30, and will now halve to 15. ""Cutting down the first time was difficult,"" he says. ""To then have to cut it again and have to cut out family is very hard. But it's what you have to do. ""It's difficult. It will almost certainly mean we will end up cutting aunts, uncles, cousins, grandparents. ""It will probably end up being that we end up with the three of us, two registrars and then very close family - parents, siblings, best man and maid of honour."" James adds: ""After the initial shock, I just want to get on with it,"" he says. ""It's not nice but it's unfortunately the world that we live in. We just want to have our day."" But it is not just couples who will be disappointed with the government's change to the rules on weddings. Marc Gough, who runs a crockery and glassware business in the wedding and events sector in Greater Manchester, said the cut to the limit for weddings to 15 was ""heart-breaking"". The wedding industry has ""been completely, utterly decimated"", says Marc Gough ""I have moved nearly 300 weddings already from this year and then to put a restriction of up to 15 for six months, I now have to contact all the brides. We're then possibly going to have to give refunds. ""I can't go back to work, I can't earn a living because you're restricting me to weddings of 15 people,"" Mr Gough said on BBC Radio 5 live. ""We can't make a living."" This video can not be played Beth Johnson and Phil Hobbs had to scale down their wedding day Mr Gough says that before the pandemic, his business Whitehouse Event Crockery had a turnover of Â£750,000. ""Now, I have probably turned over just Â£20,000. To walk into that warehouse, to put a smile on my face to the staff that I have left, to the clients that I deal with constantly, the brides, it's truly heart-breaking."" Mr Gough says it is ""draining"" having to put a ""brave face on to my family, to business people, to my staff"", and called for more financial help from the government, including an extension to the furlough scheme which is due to end next month.

Where do I have to wear a face covering now?,"Rules around face coverings are easing across the UK, but they are still required in some settings. Heathrow Airport and a number of airlines are relaxing their rules on masks. But Nicola Sturgeon has said face coverings must still be worn in Scotland after all other legal requirements are lifted on 21 March. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon hasconfirmed that Scotland's rules on face coverings will remain in place until April, due to a rise in Covid cases. All other restrictions on businesses and services will move from legal requirement to guidance on 21 March. The rules on masks will be reviewed again on 29 March, and are expected to be converted to guidance by 4 April. At the moment,masks must be worn,externalin most indoor public spaces including public transport, shops and gyms (although they can be temporarily removed when exercising). They are mandatory in pubs and restaurants when not seated or dancing, as well as in the workplace in communal areas and canteens. They no longer have to be worn bysecondary school students in the classroom- but are still required in ""indoor communal areas"" like corridors. Under-12s are exempt. What are the Covid rules in Scotland? Masks are no longer legally required in most public spaces - although they are still recommended in some situations: face coveringsremain a requirement in healthcare settings,external, such as GP surgeries, hospitals andcare homes government guidance recommends that people still wear face coverings in enclosed or private spaces where they are mixing with people they don't know many major retailers includingTesco, Sainsburys, Lidl, Waitrose and John Lewis have asked staff and customers to keep wearing masks face coveringsare no longer mandatory on Transport for London's tubes, trains or buses, but are still ""strongly encouraged"" face coveringsare no longer mandatory in Heathrow Airport's terminals, railway stations or office buildings, but are still recommended British Airways and Virgin Atlantic have said air passengerswill only have to wear masks if their destination country requires it What are the latest changes to the UK's Covid rules? Face coverings are no longer required in classrooms and some venues such as museums and cinemas. However, they will still need to be worn in shops, salons, hairdressers, health and social care settings and on public transport. The Welsh government has said it intends to lift all remaining Covid regulations by the end of March. Masks no longer needed in classrooms and cinemas Wales' mask and isolation laws could end in March Mask-wearing is no longer legally enforced in Northern Ireland. However, face coverings are still recommended in certain places, such as enclosed public spaces and health and social care settings. Northern Ireland's last Covid rules are lifted What are the remaining Covid regulations set to go? InWales, the penalty for a first offence is Â£60, with the fine doubling for each subsequent offence - up to a maximum of Â£1,920. Repeat offenders can also be prosecuted in court where fines are unlimited. InScotland, the police can issue a penalty notice of up to Â£60 for breaking the law on mask-wearing. Evidence suggeststransmission mainly happens indoors,external, where people are close together. Covering the nose and mouth reduces the spread of coronavirus droplets from coughs, sneezes and while speaking. The main purpose is to protect others, although there is someevidence they offer protection to wearers. Five ways to avoid catching coronavirus indoors It should: have a nose wire have at least two or three layers of material fit snugly over mouth, nose and chin Standard surgical masks are acceptable. It is also possible to buy FFP2 and FFP3 masks used by healthcare workerswhich can offer higher protection. However, these must be fitted correctly to work.

Join us again tomorrow for more of the latest news on coronavirus as it happens. Today's contributors were Sean Fanning, Chris Clayton, Martha Buckley, Marie Jackson, Georgina Rannard, Doug Faulkner, Jennifer Scott, Penny Spiller, Paul Seddon and Justin Parkinson. If you are just joining us, or have been overwhelmed by the number of announcements, here are some of today's headlines from around the UK:  Thank you for following our coverage
of the coronavirus pandemic. Hereâs a quick reminder of the major stories from around
the world: Among today's announcements is the introduction of a 10pm closing time for the hospitality industry, as well as a table service-only rule. The news has been greeted with concern by businesses in the sector. Tom Stainer, chief executive of the Campaign for Real Ale, said pub customers and publicans wanted to stop the spread of the virus but said the government hadn't shown the evidence that pubs were disproportionately contributing to increased infections. ""It is additional pressure on already fragile pubs which are at real risk of closure,"" he said, pointing out there was currently no support on offer from the government. Mr Stainer added the curfew would cut into several hours of ""high trading times"" at a time when the industry needed to pay off debts after the lockdown. Andy Lennox, founder of Zim Braai restaurants, said his business had lost 30% of its revenue ""overnight"" with the 10pm closing time and it was going to be ""very difficult"". ""The big thing now is what the support going to be, we need some kind of more flexi-furlough brought in that will allow us to add new employees to that, the VAT needs to stay - that 5% is massive,"" he said. Mr Lennox added that Eat Out To Help Out had helped in August - but had only made back losses the industry had already suffered. There have been national protests calling for more protective equipment for health workers The US Congress approved a whopping $3tn emergency funding to fight the coronavirus pandemic back in March. But could it be that some of the money did not go to where it was intended? That is the claim in a Washington Post report, which says $1bn earmarked for the US Defence Department to boost a shortage of medical supplies instead went on patching up gaps in military equipment procurement for items such as jet engines, body armour and uniforms. Some defence contractors, the Washington Post goes on to say, had already tapped into other bail-out measures, such as the job-protection scheme. Analysts say officials are struggling to account for some of the Congress-approved funds. There has been no response yet from the Pentagon. You can read the story in the Washington Posthere,external.  Northern Ireland's First Minister Arlene Foster has described new restrictions in the nation asa ""wake-up call"". She said the ""tough"" new measures, which include banning different households from mixing indoors, were not a second lockdown, while Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neil called for a big push to curb the rise in cases during a joint televised address. Mrs Foster said the actions being taken were ""designed to prevent the need for a return to lockdown"". ""We have risen to the challenge many times before,"" she said. Ms O'Neill said: ""The choices you make could be the difference between life and death for those closest to you."" The new measures came into effect at 18:00. The government has published its updated guidance for coronavirus measure in England, following Boris Johnson's televised address. Here are some the changes: Read the updated guidancehere,external. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey says the PM ""must
take responsibility for what has gone wrong"" with ""his 'world-beating' test-and-trace system"". He calls it ""inexcusable"" that this has been ""overwhelmed"" in recent weeks. West Ham United manager David Moyes and two of his players have tested positive for coronavirus,the club has said. Moyes, 57, defender Issa Diop, 23, and 24-year-old midfielder Josh Cullen will now be required to self-isolate. ""The manager and both players immediately left the stadium and have returned home,"" said a club statement. The club was told of the results ahead of its Carabao Cup tie against Hull City on Tuesday. Pubs, bars and restaurants in Wales must only provide a table service and will have to close at 22:00 from Thursday, the Welsh First Minister has confirmed. In a televised address Mark Drakeford warned: ""In the weeks and months ahead of us, there is a very real possibility we could see coronavirus regain a foothold in our local communities, towns and cities. None of us wants to see that happen again."" He said some parts of south Wales had seen the sharpest rise in cases and were already under strict local measures but said ""we now need to make that difference across Wales"". Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she recognised the latest restrictions may feel like a ""step backwards"", but urged Scots to stick with them, insisting they ""will make a difference"". She said through collective efforts the virus had been beaten back but warned that over winter ""the challenge is once again getting harder"". ""But please know that thanks to all your efforts over the last six months, we are in a much stronger position than in the spring,"" she added. ""Cases are rising but less rapidly than back then."" Analysis Alex ForsythPolitical correspondent While Labour broadly supports the stricter
measures the partyâs criticism centres on two points; the party says the Test
and Trace system isnât working and itâs repeatedly called for more financial
support for sectors that have been adversely affected by restrictions. That
pressureâs growing; including from some on the Tory benches concerned about the
impact of a restricted economy on businesses. For Labour, shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth says the PM should not be ""phasing out"" the furlough scheme, which is due to finish at the end of next month. He tells the BBC preserving public health and the economy does not represent an ""either/or"" choice for the government. Mr Ashworth accuses ministers of ignoring ""all the warnings"" on the coronavirus testing system. Prime Minister Boris Johnson
- in a televised message to the country â reiterated the governmentâs new âtougher
package of measuresâ designed to curb the rise in coronavirus infection. New restrictions for
England are expected to last for the next six months. These include pubs and
restaurants closing from 10pm, the compulsory wearing of face masks and
coverings for shop workers, people advised to work from home âwherever
possibleâ and tougher enforcement of rule-breaking. Thereâs more detail on the new
ruleshere.  Alex ForsythPolitical correspondent Boris
Johnson adopted a similar line to the one he used in Parliament earlier - that of acting now to prevent more onerous restrictions later Both politically and economically, the government is
desperate to avoid another wholesale lockdown and hopes these measures will
help. When he addressed MPs earlier, the PMâs assertion that these new measures might be in
place for six months was stark. Now heâs offering a sprinkling of optimism by
saying things will be better by the spring, but that doesnât mean the country
isnât in for a few tough and uncertain months. Alex ForsythPolitical correspondent Some have suggested the government should
allow people to take more personal risk. Yesterday, the Chief Medical Officer for England, Chris Whitty, said increasing the risk for individuals increased the risk for everyone. Now, Boris Johnson is echoing that refrain, saying ""these risks are not our own"" - with Downing Street pushing a sense of national unity and resolve. The PM tells the UK population: ""Never in our history has our collective destiny and our
collective health depended so completely on our individual behaviour."" There will be ""great days ahead"", he predicts, calling for ""discipline"", ""resolve"" and a ""spirit of togetherness that will carry us through"". That ends Boris Johnson's address. Alex ForsythPolitical correspondent The prime minister says this approach carries the support of the main parliamentary
parties, but itâs not without question. Thereâs still tension in the Conservative party
about whether today's measures go far enough, or indeed too far, and what role Parliament
should have in scrutinising them and signing them off. And Labour is among the opposition voices
calling for more financial support for affected sectors and improvements to the
testing system. This video can not be played Coronavirus: PM says health depends on âindividual behaviourâ Boris Johnson says bringing in extra restrictions now will keep shops and schools open. Meanwhile, the NHS is ""better prepared"" than it was when the pandemic first hit the UK, with personal protective equipment, extra beds and Nightingale hospitals in place, he adds. Doctors and medical advisers are ""rightly worried"" at the moment, the prime minister says, but they are ""unanimous that things will be far better
by the spring"", with the ""hope"" of a vaccine by then and more efficient mass testing. That is the ""hope"" and the ""dream"", he adds. Boris Johnson says he's ""deeply, spiritually reluctant"" to curb civil liberties, but the virus can't be allowed to get out of control or NHS patients with ""non-Covid needs"" will suffer. Another lockdown would threaten jobs and ""the loving human contact"" on which we all depend"", he adds. Education would suffer and loneliness would grow, the PM argues. Alex ForsythPolitical correspondent It goes without saying the prime minister only addresses the
nation when No 10 thinks itâs needed. It is a sign of the extraordinary and
difficult year it's been that this may feel familiar now to some people at home. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Schools sending pupils home quadruple in a week,"The number of schools in England sending home groups of pupils because of Covid-19 incidents has quadrupled in a week, according to the latest official figures. Based on attendance last Thursday, they show 4% of schools not fully open because of confirmed or suspected cases - up from 1% the previous week. This could mean about 900 schools sending home pupils. Overall attendance has also dipped slightly from 88% to 87%. This means over a million children were off school that day, whether from Covid-related or other reasons, with more pupils missing from secondary schools than primary. The fall in attendance should ""ring alarm bells"" for the government, said Paul Whiteman, leader of the National Association of Head Teachers. ""Clearly the failure of Covid testing sits at the heart of this. The inability of staff and families to successfully get tested when they display symptoms means that schools are struggling with staffing, children are missing school, and ultimately that children's education is being needlessly disrupted,"" said Mr Whiteman. 88% of pupils back in school for start of term Children's commissioner says one in 20 off with Covid-related issues Heads warn of staff shortages without Covid tests for teachers Booking Covid test like 'getting Harry Potter tickets' This is the second set of Department for Education attendance figures since schools returned in the autumn - and they show a significant increase in schools sending home groups of pupils or whole year groups because of concerns about coronavirus. But they also show the number of schools which were fully open had increased - up from 92% to 94% - because the previous week's figures included schools that were still carrying out a phased start to the year or holding teacher training days. The figures, based on responses from 76% of state schools, show almost no schools being completely closed - with 99.9% recorded as open. This combination of more schools completing their reopening - and at the same time more schools sending pupils home because of Covid-19 - meant that the overall attendance figure balanced out as being similar to the previous week, from 88% to 87%. This is well below what would be expected, with attendance rates usually around 95%. An even lower proportion of vulnerable children, such as those with a social worker, were recorded as being at school, with an attendance rate of 81%. Geoff Barton, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union, said that with rising rates of infection and problems with Covid testing, the attendance figures were ""not at all surprising"". ""Frankly, it is a great relief that the situation is not a lot worse,"" said Mr Barton, who warned that even though schools were ""working incredibly hard to manage this very difficult situation"" it was going to be a ""long, hard winter"". Problems with getting Covid tests was making it harder for schools, said Kevin Courtney, joint leader of the National Education Union.

THE LIFE SCIENTIFIC:In charge of one the most successful Covid-19 vaccine projects in the world YOUR WORK, YOUR MONEY:Financial help if youâre forced to quarantine Education Secretary Gavin Williamson welcomed that 99.9% of schools were open, but said: ""As we would expect, this data shows a small number of pupils are self-isolating in line with public health advice.""

China sets surprise 2060 carbon neutrality goal,"China's President Xi Jinping addressing the UN via video link China will aim to hit peak emissions before 2030 and for carbon neutrality by 2060, President Xi Jinping has announced. Mr Xi outlined the steps when speaking via videolink to the UN General Assembly in New York. The announcement is being seen as a significant step in the fight against climate change. China is the world's biggest source of carbon dioxide, responsible for around 28% of global emissions. Green plans diluted as government protects farmers Arctic sea-ice shrinks to near record low extent Prince Charles calls for 'swift' action on climate With global climate negotiations stalled and this year's conference of the parties (COP26,external) postponed until 2021, there had been little expectation of progress on the issue at the UN General Assembly. However China's president surprised the UN gathering by making a bold statement about his country's plans for tackling emissions. He called on all countries to achieve a green recovery for the world economy in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. According to the official translation, Mr Xi went on to say: ""We aim to have CO2 emissions peak before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060."" Until now China has said it would peak its emissions by 2030 at the latest, but it has avoided committing to a long-term goal. Emissions from China continued to rise in 2018 and 2019 even as much of the world began to shift away from fossil fuels. While the Covid-19 crisis this spring saw the country's emissions plunge by 25%, by June they had bounced back again as coal-fired plants, cement and other heavy industries went back to work. In 2014 the US and China reached a surprise agreement on climate change Observers believe that in making this statement at this time, the Chinese leader is taking advantage of US reluctance to address the climate question. ""Xi Jinping's climate pledge at the UN, minutes after President Donald Trump's speech, is clearly a bold and well calculated move,"" said Li Shuo, an expert on Chinese climate policy from Greenpeace Asia. ""It demonstrates Xi's consistent interest in leveraging the climate agenda for geopolitical purposes."" Back in 2014 Mr Xi and then US-President Barack Obama came to a surprise agreement on climate change, which became a key building block ofthe Paris agreement signed in December 2015. Mr Xi has again delivered a surprise according to Li Shuo. ""By playing the climate card a little differently, Xi has not only injected much needed momentum to global climate politics, but presented an intriguing geopolitical question in front of the world: on a global common issue, China has moved ahead regardless of the US. Will Washington follow?"" There are many questions about the announcement that remain unanswered, including what is meant exactly by carbon neutrality and what actions the country will take to get there. ""Today's announcement by President Xi Jinping that China intends to reach carbon neutrality before 2060 is big and important news - the closer to 2050 the better,"" said former US climate envoy Todd Stern. ""His announcement that China will start down this road right away by adopting more vigorous policies is also welcome. Simply peaking emissions 'before 2030' won't be enough to put China on the rapid path needed for carbon neutrality, but overall this is a very encouraging step."" This week has seen the second lowest Arctic sea ice minimum on record Most observers agreed that the announcement from China was a significant step, not least because of the country's role in financing fossil fuel development around the world. ""China isn't just the world's biggest emitter but the biggest energy financier and biggest market, so its decisions play a major role in shaping how the rest of the world progresses with its transition away from the fossil fuels that cause climate change,"" said Richard Black, director of the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU), a UK-based think tank. ""The announcement today is also a major fillip for the European Union, whose leaders recently urged President Xi to take exactly this step as part of a joint push on lowering emissions, showing that international moves to curb climate change remain alive despite the best efforts of Donald Trump and [Brazil's president] Jair Bolsonaro in the run-up to next year's COP26 in Glasgow.""

Boris Johnson's statement in full,"Prime Minister Boris Johnson has used a national TV address tourge the public to ""summon the discipline and the resolve"" to follow the new coronavirus rules announced on Tuesday.This is his statement in full: ""Good evening, the struggle against Covid is the single biggest crisis the world has faced in my lifetime. In less than a year this disease has killed almost a million people, and caused havoc to economies everywhere. Here in the UK we mourn every person we have lost, and we grieve with their families. And yet I am more certain than ever that this is a struggle that humanity will win, and we in this country will win - and to achieve what we must I want to talk to you directly tonight about the choices that we face - none of them easy - and why we must take action now. I know that we can succeed because we have succeeded before. When the sickness took hold in this country in March, we pulled together in a spirit of national sacrifice and community. We followed the guidance to the letter. We stayed at home, protected the NHS, and saved thousands of lives. And for months with those disciplines of social distancing we have kept that virus at bay. But we have to acknowledge this is a great and freedom-loving country; and while the vast majority have complied with the rules there have been too many breaches - too many opportunities for our invisible enemy to slip through undetected. The virus has started to spread again in an exponential way. Infections are up, hospital admissions are climbing. We can see what is happening in France and Spain, and we know, alas, that this virus is no less fatal than it was in the spring, and that the vast majority of our people are no less susceptible, and the iron laws of geometrical progression are shouting at us from the graphs that we risk many more deaths, many more families losing loved ones before their time. And I know that faced with that risk the British people will want their government to continue to fight to protect them, you, and that is what we are doing, night and day. And yet the single greatest weapon we bring to this fight is the common sense of the people themselves - the joint resolve of this country to work together to suppress Covid now. So today I set out a package of tougher measures in England - early closing for pubs, bars; table service only; closing businesses that are not Covid secure; expanding the use of face coverings, and new fines for those that fail to comply; and once again asking office workers to work from home if they can while enforcing the rule of six indoors and outdoors - a tougher package of national measures combined with the potential for tougher local restrictions for areas already in lockdown. I know that this approach - robust but proportionate - already carries the support of all the main parties in Parliament. After discussion with colleagues in the devolved administrations, I believe this broad approach is shared across the whole UK. SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? SUPPORT BUBBLES:What are they and who can be in yours? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? WEDDINGS:Can I have a reception with guests? SOCIAL LIFE:Is it safe to go to the pub? And to those who say we don't need this stuff, and we should leave people to take their own risks, I say these risks are not our own. The tragic reality of having Covid is that your mild cough can be someone else's death knell. And as for the suggestion that we should simply lock up the elderly and the vulnerable - with all the suffering that would entail - I must tell you that this is just not realistic, because if you let the virus rip through the rest of the population it would inevitably find its way through to the elderly as well, and in much greater numbers. That's why we need to suppress the virus now, and as for that minority who may continue to flout the rules, we will enforce those rules with tougher penalties and fines of up to Â£10,000. We will put more police out on the streets and use the army to backfill if necessary. And of course I am deeply, spiritually reluctant to make any of these impositions, or infringe anyone's freedom, but unless we take action the risk is that we will have to go for tougher measures later, when the deaths have already mounted and we have a huge caseload of infection such as we had in the spring. If we let this virus get out of control now, it would mean that our NHS had no space - once again - to deal with cancer patients and millions of other non-Covid medical needs. And if we were forced into a new national lockdown, that would threaten not just jobs and livelihoods but the loving human contact on which we all depend. It would mean renewed loneliness and confinement for the elderly and vulnerable, and ultimately it would threaten once again the education of our children. We must do all we can to avoid going down that road again. But if people don't follow the rules we have set out, then we must reserve the right to go further. We must take action now because a stitch in time saves nine; and this way we can keep people in work, we can keep our shops and our schools open, and we can keep our country moving forward while we work together to suppress the virus. That is our strategy, and if we can follow this package together, then I know we can succeed because in so many ways we are better prepared than before. We have the PPE, we have the beds, we have the Nightingales, we have new medicines - pioneered in this country - that can help save lives. And though our doctors and our medical advisers are rightly worried about the data now, and the risks over winter, they are unanimous that things will be far better by the spring, when we have not only the hope of a vaccine, but one day soon - and I must stress that we are not there yet - of mass testing so efficient that people will be able to be tested in minutes so they can do more of the things they love. That's the hope; that's the dream. It's hard, but it's attainable, and we are working as hard as we can to get there. But until we do, we must rely on our willingness to look out for each other, to protect each other. Never in our history has our collective destiny and our collective health depended so completely on our individual behaviour. If we follow these simple rules together, we will get through this winter together. There are unquestionably difficult months to come. And the fight against Covid is by no means over. I have no doubt, however, that there are great days ahead. But now is the time for us all to summon the discipline, and the resolve, and the spirit of togetherness that will carry us through.

Last throw of dice before tough call,"The disconnect between scientists and ministers in England could not be more stark. On Monday, the government's two most senior pandemic advisers - Prof Chris Whitty and Sir Patrick Vallance - set out the scale of the problem, raising the prospect of 50,000 cases a day by October. On Tuesday, ministers provided their answer - closing pubs early, asking people to work from home and making face coverings mandatory in a few more situations. But that was about it. In Northern Ireland and Scotland, they went further, banning visits to other people's homes. But even that fell short of the mini-lockdowns and ""circuit breaks"" floated last week. Clearly, there need to be trade-offs between containing the spread of the virus and minimising the impact to society. But there is more to the past two days than that. There is a recognition within government the public is tiring of the battle against coronavirus. Estimates suggest only one in five people is self-isolating fully when asked. And you need only to listen to government adviser Prof Robert Dingwall to realise the problem ministers are facing. Last week, he warned the public was ""just going through the motions"" and had become ""comfortable"" with the idea that thousands would die just as thousands died with flu each year. And this is the context in which Prof Whitty and Sir Patrick took to the screens in Monday. The decision to present the 50,000-cases scenario was discussed carefully in advance I understand. It was based on cases doubling every week from now until the middle of next month. This was happening at one point at the end of August and start of September. But it is far from a given that it will continue - in fact even now the trajectory looks to be below that. They could have referenced the trends Spain and France were on - two countries they mentioned in other parts of the briefing. But they didn't. If they had, this is what it would have looked like. Sir Patrick did point out the 50,000 figure was not a prediction. But it was used in the knowledge it would grab the headlines. Why? One person close to the decision-making told me it was about influencing behaviour - to try to persuade the public to redouble its efforts. That much was clear from Prof Whitty's plea for people to think of others. If anyone increased their own risk of exposure, they also ""increase the risk of everyone"" around them, he said. With the numbers of hospital admissions and deaths still low, there is a window of opportunity before more difficult decisions have to be taken. And that is why the restrictions ministers introduced are somewhat more limited than the scientists' warning might have suggested was needed. Even if the public does take more care - and the fear is the large proportion at minimal risk will not, as taking steps such as self-isolating for 14 days on the basis of close contact with an infected individual can cost people income - it remains doubtful the rise in cases will be halted. That is because the virus is stealthy. People are infectious before symptoms develop - and some remain asymptomatic. On top of that we are entering the time of year when respiratory illnesses circulate more easily. Many experts have questioned whether the 50,000-cases-a-day figure will be reached by mid-October - called implausible by some - but it would still be a big surprise if infection rates do not continue to gradually climb. Prof Paul Hunter, from the University of East Anglia, says it is now ""almost certain"" there will be an increase in the next two to three months. He wants to see more focus on protecting the most vulnerable. And that is likely to happen soon. But the government will still have a big decision to make if it is determined to reduce the number of cases, which the prime minister suggested was its goal. A full lockdown remains highly unlikely. But more significant steps, such as closing hospitality venues and leisure facilities and curbing everyday activities, from playing sport to travelling around the country, remain options. In the end it will come down to how far the government is prepared to go to contain the virus. How much economic pain and disruption and damage to society and the wider health and wellbeing of individuals is worth the lives at risk? That, unfortunately, is the horrible dilemma likely to have to be faced. The really tough calls are still to come.

Join us again tomorrow for more of the latest news on coronavirus as it happens. Today's contributors were Sean Fanning, Chris Clayton, Martha Buckley, Marie Jackson, Georgina Rannard, Doug Faulkner, Jennifer Scott, Penny Spiller, Paul Seddon and Justin Parkinson. If you are just joining us, or have been overwhelmed by the number of announcements, here are some of today's headlines from around the UK:  Thank you for following our coverage
of the coronavirus pandemic. Hereâs a quick reminder of the major stories from around
the world: Among today's announcements is the introduction of a 10pm closing time for the hospitality industry, as well as a table service-only rule. The news has been greeted with concern by businesses in the sector. Tom Stainer, chief executive of the Campaign for Real Ale, said pub customers and publicans wanted to stop the spread of the virus but said the government hadn't shown the evidence that pubs were disproportionately contributing to increased infections. ""It is additional pressure on already fragile pubs which are at real risk of closure,"" he said, pointing out there was currently no support on offer from the government. Mr Stainer added the curfew would cut into several hours of ""high trading times"" at a time when the industry needed to pay off debts after the lockdown. Andy Lennox, founder of Zim Braai restaurants, said his business had lost 30% of its revenue ""overnight"" with the 10pm closing time and it was going to be ""very difficult"". ""The big thing now is what the support going to be, we need some kind of more flexi-furlough brought in that will allow us to add new employees to that, the VAT needs to stay - that 5% is massive,"" he said. Mr Lennox added that Eat Out To Help Out had helped in August - but had only made back losses the industry had already suffered. There have been national protests calling for more protective equipment for health workers The US Congress approved a whopping $3tn emergency funding to fight the coronavirus pandemic back in March. But could it be that some of the money did not go to where it was intended? That is the claim in a Washington Post report, which says $1bn earmarked for the US Defence Department to boost a shortage of medical supplies instead went on patching up gaps in military equipment procurement for items such as jet engines, body armour and uniforms. Some defence contractors, the Washington Post goes on to say, had already tapped into other bail-out measures, such as the job-protection scheme. Analysts say officials are struggling to account for some of the Congress-approved funds. There has been no response yet from the Pentagon. You can read the story in the Washington Posthere,external.  Northern Ireland's First Minister Arlene Foster has described new restrictions in the nation asa ""wake-up call"". She said the ""tough"" new measures, which include banning different households from mixing indoors, were not a second lockdown, while Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neil called for a big push to curb the rise in cases during a joint televised address. Mrs Foster said the actions being taken were ""designed to prevent the need for a return to lockdown"". ""We have risen to the challenge many times before,"" she said. Ms O'Neill said: ""The choices you make could be the difference between life and death for those closest to you."" The new measures came into effect at 18:00. The government has published its updated guidance for coronavirus measure in England, following Boris Johnson's televised address. Here are some the changes: Read the updated guidancehere,external. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey says the PM ""must
take responsibility for what has gone wrong"" with ""his 'world-beating' test-and-trace system"". He calls it ""inexcusable"" that this has been ""overwhelmed"" in recent weeks. West Ham United manager David Moyes and two of his players have tested positive for coronavirus,the club has said. Moyes, 57, defender Issa Diop, 23, and 24-year-old midfielder Josh Cullen will now be required to self-isolate. ""The manager and both players immediately left the stadium and have returned home,"" said a club statement. The club was told of the results ahead of its Carabao Cup tie against Hull City on Tuesday. Pubs, bars and restaurants in Wales must only provide a table service and will have to close at 22:00 from Thursday, the Welsh First Minister has confirmed. In a televised address Mark Drakeford warned: ""In the weeks and months ahead of us, there is a very real possibility we could see coronavirus regain a foothold in our local communities, towns and cities. None of us wants to see that happen again."" He said some parts of south Wales had seen the sharpest rise in cases and were already under strict local measures but said ""we now need to make that difference across Wales"". Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she recognised the latest restrictions may feel like a ""step backwards"", but urged Scots to stick with them, insisting they ""will make a difference"". She said through collective efforts the virus had been beaten back but warned that over winter ""the challenge is once again getting harder"". ""But please know that thanks to all your efforts over the last six months, we are in a much stronger position than in the spring,"" she added. ""Cases are rising but less rapidly than back then."" Analysis Alex ForsythPolitical correspondent While Labour broadly supports the stricter
measures the partyâs criticism centres on two points; the party says the Test
and Trace system isnât working and itâs repeatedly called for more financial
support for sectors that have been adversely affected by restrictions. That
pressureâs growing; including from some on the Tory benches concerned about the
impact of a restricted economy on businesses. For Labour, shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth says the PM should not be ""phasing out"" the furlough scheme, which is due to finish at the end of next month. He tells the BBC preserving public health and the economy does not represent an ""either/or"" choice for the government. Mr Ashworth accuses ministers of ignoring ""all the warnings"" on the coronavirus testing system. Prime Minister Boris Johnson
- in a televised message to the country â reiterated the governmentâs new âtougher
package of measuresâ designed to curb the rise in coronavirus infection. New restrictions for
England are expected to last for the next six months. These include pubs and
restaurants closing from 10pm, the compulsory wearing of face masks and
coverings for shop workers, people advised to work from home âwherever
possibleâ and tougher enforcement of rule-breaking. Thereâs more detail on the new
ruleshere.  Alex ForsythPolitical correspondent Boris
Johnson adopted a similar line to the one he used in Parliament earlier - that of acting now to prevent more onerous restrictions later Both politically and economically, the government is
desperate to avoid another wholesale lockdown and hopes these measures will
help. When he addressed MPs earlier, the PMâs assertion that these new measures might be in
place for six months was stark. Now heâs offering a sprinkling of optimism by
saying things will be better by the spring, but that doesnât mean the country
isnât in for a few tough and uncertain months. Alex ForsythPolitical correspondent Some have suggested the government should
allow people to take more personal risk. Yesterday, the Chief Medical Officer for England, Chris Whitty, said increasing the risk for individuals increased the risk for everyone. Now, Boris Johnson is echoing that refrain, saying ""these risks are not our own"" - with Downing Street pushing a sense of national unity and resolve. The PM tells the UK population: ""Never in our history has our collective destiny and our
collective health depended so completely on our individual behaviour."" There will be ""great days ahead"", he predicts, calling for ""discipline"", ""resolve"" and a ""spirit of togetherness that will carry us through"". That ends Boris Johnson's address. Alex ForsythPolitical correspondent The prime minister says this approach carries the support of the main parliamentary
parties, but itâs not without question. Thereâs still tension in the Conservative party
about whether today's measures go far enough, or indeed too far, and what role Parliament
should have in scrutinising them and signing them off. And Labour is among the opposition voices
calling for more financial support for affected sectors and improvements to the
testing system. This video can not be played Coronavirus: PM says health depends on âindividual behaviourâ Boris Johnson says bringing in extra restrictions now will keep shops and schools open. Meanwhile, the NHS is ""better prepared"" than it was when the pandemic first hit the UK, with personal protective equipment, extra beds and Nightingale hospitals in place, he adds. Doctors and medical advisers are ""rightly worried"" at the moment, the prime minister says, but they are ""unanimous that things will be far better
by the spring"", with the ""hope"" of a vaccine by then and more efficient mass testing. That is the ""hope"" and the ""dream"", he adds. Boris Johnson says he's ""deeply, spiritually reluctant"" to curb civil liberties, but the virus can't be allowed to get out of control or NHS patients with ""non-Covid needs"" will suffer. Another lockdown would threaten jobs and ""the loving human contact"" on which we all depend"", he adds. Education would suffer and loneliness would grow, the PM argues. Alex ForsythPolitical correspondent It goes without saying the prime minister only addresses the
nation when No 10 thinks itâs needed. It is a sign of the extraordinary and
difficult year it's been that this may feel familiar now to some people at home. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
PM calls for resolve and discipline to fight Covid,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson said that collective health depends on ""individual behaviour"" Prime Minister Boris Johnson has called on the public to ""summon the discipline and the resolve"" to follow the new coronavirus rules announced on Tuesday. In a television broadcast to the country he warned the government may go further if people do not stick to them. Mr Johnson said while the vast majority have complied with the measures so far, ""there have been too many breaches"". New restrictions were announced across the UK earlier, with Mr Johnson warning rules could last for up to six months. In England,,externalrules on face coverings have been expanded and the number of people allowed at weddings has been halved. Pubs, restaurants and other hospitality venues will have to close by 22:00 BST, while the fines for breaking the rules will also increase to Â£200 on the first offence. Hospitality venues will also have to close early in Scotland and Wales - but Scotlandhas gone further, banning people from visiting other people's homes. Northern Irelandhas also already bannedhouseholds mixing indoors. It comes as the number of UK cases rose by 4,926 on Tuesday,government figures showed,external, with deaths increasing by 37. Boris Johnson's statement in full How have the rules changed? How many cases are there in your area? Where do I have to wear a face covering now? Speaking on Tuesday evening, Mr Johnson explained the new measures, saying they were ""robust but proportionate"". ""And to those who say we don't need this stuff, and we should leave people to take their own risks, I say these risks are not our own,"" he said. ""The tragic reality of having Covid is that your mild cough can be someone else's death knell. ""And as for the suggestion that we should simply lock up the elderly and the vulnerable - with all the suffering that would entail - I must tell you that this is just not realistic, because if you let the virus rip through the rest of the population it would inevitably find its way through to the elderly as well, and in much greater numbers."" Mr Johnson said he was ""deeply, spiritually reluctant"" to infringe on anyone's freedom, but added: ""Unless we take action the risk is that we will have to go for tougher measures later."" ""If people don't follow the rules we have set out, then we must reserve the right to go further,"" he added. More police will be put on the streets and the Army will be used as back-up if need be, he said. ""If we follow these simple rules together, we will get through this winter together,"" he added. ""There are unquestionably difficult months to come. ""And the fight against Covid is by no means over. I have no doubt, however, that there are great days ahead. ""But now is the time for us all to summon the discipline, and the resolve, and the spirit of togetherness that will carry us through."" This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""It would be tempting to think the threat had faded"" In her statement on Tuesday evening, Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: ""In a global pandemic of a virus with as yet no vaccine, we simply can't have 100% normality. No country can. So we must choose our priorities."" She said that although ""today must feel like a step backwards"", the country is ""in a much stronger position than in the spring"". ""It won't last forever and one day, hopefully soon, we will be looking back on it, not living through it,"" she said. And she added: ""I will never find the words to thank all of you enough for the enormous sacrifices you have made so far. And I am sorry to be asking for more."" Meanwhile, Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford said: ""In the weeks and months ahead of us, there is a very real possibility we could see coronavirus regain a foothold in our local communities, towns and cities. None of us wants to see that happen again"". And Northern Ireland's First Minister Arlene Foster has said tougher restrictions being imposed in the nationdo not represent a second lockdown but should act as a ""wake-up call"". A televised address from the prime minister is not the rarity it once was, but it's still a big moment. The coronavirus pandemic has required Boris Johnson to appeal directly to the public on more than one occasion. The gravity of the situation is such that, his argument goes, a renewed national effort is required to bring the virus back under control. Behind the echoes of wartime rhetoric and Johnsonian linguistic flourishes was a simple message; stick with it for six months and we'll get through this. But as he acknowledged, there are some who say he's taking the wrong decisions and the public's patience for further restrictions may not be what it was six months ago. There was optimism that better days lay ahead but a vaccine and mass testing were ""hopes and dreams"" not the reality, not now. Scotland's First Minister had gone further so comparisons will be inevitable; which tactics will work? While England and the UK's nerve is being tested again, so too is the prime minister and the government's leadership and its strategy. THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters LOCAL LOCKDOWNS:What happens if you have one? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? WEDDINGS:Can I have a reception with guests? SOCIAL LIFE:Is it safe to go to the pub? Earlier, Mr Johnson told MPs that the new rules were ""carefully judged"" to achieve the maximum reduction in the R number - which measures how quickly the virus is spreading - while causing ""the minimum damage to lives and livelihoods"". If these restrictions fail to bring the R number below one - the point where the epidemic is no longer growing - ""then we reserve the right to deploy greater fire power with significantly greater restrictions"" he said. Thelatest R estimate for the whole of the UK is between 1.1 and 1.4. Weddings: 'We have to phone 15 people and un-invite them' Analysis: Last throw of dice before the really tough call Mr Johnson said that unless progress was made, people should assume the restrictions would remain in place ""for perhaps six months"". But Ms Sturgeon said the rules in Scotland would ""not necessarily"" be in place for as long as six months - and would be reviewed every three weeks. Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth told the BBC the new restrictions could have been avoided if the government ""fixed testing and tracing"". Mr Ashworth said Labour supported the new measures but that ""we shouldn't have been here"". ""So what we need to do now is drive infections down, we all need to follow the rules, but the government in return have really got to fix this testing system and this tracing system, and give people the support when they need to isolate.""

Ban on meeting in houses extended across Scotland,"This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon announces extension of ban on meeting in houses A ban on visiting other people's homes is to be imposed across Scotland, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has announced. The measure is already in place for more than 1.75 million people in Glasgow and some neighbouring areas. But Ms Sturgeon said it would be rolled out across the whole of Scotland from Wednesday in a bid to get the virus under control again before winter. She also confirmed that Scotland would be following England in imposing a 10pm curfew on pubs and restaurants. The curfew will be in place from Friday - with Ms Sturgeon warning that any premises that do not comply could be shut down completely. Indoor and outdoor gatherings in Scotland were restricted to six people from two households just two weeks ago. Live reaction to Ms Sturgeon's statement What are the latest rules in Scotland? 'We've reached a perilous turning point' - PM However, the number of people testing positive for the virus has continued to increase since then - with the average number of new cases every day now reaching 285, compared to only seven a day in July. The 383 new cases confirmed on Tuesday was the highest daily total since 15 April, and the sixth highest since the outbreak began in Scotland. The first minister said hospital and intensive care admissions were also starting to rise, with more older people testing positive. She said the country therefore had to go further to prevent the virus spreading unchecked, and that the scientific advice was that household interaction was a ""key driver"" of transmission. Ms Sturgeon said the Scottish government had therefore decided ""after careful consideration"" that visiting other people's homes will no longer be permitted. The move means Scotland will have tougher coronavirus restrictions than England - where people can can still meet in groups of up to six in a house. She said: ""One of the reasons we have decided to do this is that our early data suggests this restriction is starting to slow the increase of cases in the west of Scotland. ""So if we extend it nationwide now, in an early and preventative way, we hope it will help to bring the R number down and the virus back under control."" Regulations enforcing the changes will come into place from Friday, but Ms Sturgeon said everyone should comply from Wednesday. The first minister said the new restrictions on visiting other households would be reviewed every three weeks - and stressed that they will ""not necessarily"" be in place for as long as six months, as some reports have suggested. There will be exceptions for those living alone, or alone with children, who form extended households. The rules will also not apply to couples who do not live together, or to tradespeople or for the provision of informal childcare - such as by grandparents. Meetings in public indoor settings - such as pubs and restaurants - will continue to be limited to a maximum of six people from two households. And up to six people from two different households can continue to meet outdoors, including in private gardens. Ms Sturgeon urged people not to book foreign trips during the October holiday However, children under the age of 12will be exemptfrom both the limit of six and the limit of two households if they are meeting outside. And young people aged between 12 to 18 will be exempt from the two household limit - so will be able to meet outdoors in groups of up to six. Ms Sturgeon acknowledged: ""The measures I am announcing today are tough - I will not pretend otherwise - but they do not represent a full-scale lockdown of the kind imposed in March. ""Indeed, today's measures are an attempt to avoid another lockdown. ""By acting early and substantially, our hope is that these new measures will be in place for a shorter period than would be the case if we waited longer to act."" The first minister said she was keeping the option of a so-called circuit breaker -  a short period of nationwide lockdown, potentially during the October holiday - under review. She urged peoplenot to book overseas travelfor the October break ""unless it is absolutely essential"", and advised against car sharing with people outside your own household. Ms Sturgeon made her statement to the Scottish Parliament shortly after Prime Minister Boris Johnsonoutlined new measures in Englandin the House of Commons. The two leaders and their counterparts in Wales and Northern Ireland have held talks over a UK-wide approach over the past 24 hours. Both the UK and Scottish leaders made television broadcasts to the nation on Tuesday evening. Prime Minister Boris Johnson called on the public to ""summon the discipline and the resolve"" to follow the new rules, warning the government may go further if people do not stick to them. Mr Johnson said while the vast majority have complied with the measures so far, ""there have been too many breaches"". Immediately afterwards,Nicola Sturgeon said the latest restrictions may feel like a ""step backwards"", but urged Scots to stick with them anyway, insisting they ""will make a difference"". She said: ""Please know that thanks to all your efforts over the last six months, we are in a much stronger position than in the spring."" The day's announcements came after theUK's Covid-19 alert level moved to 4, meaning the virus is ""high or rising exponentially"". The licensed trade has warned that forcing them to close at 10pm could lead to further job losses Stephen Montgomery of the Scottish Hospitality Group, which represents more than 50 pubs and restaurants, accused Ms Sturgeon of ""singling out"" the industry despite ""very little evidence"" that it is linked to the spread of the virus. He said: ""With 90,000 Scottish jobs at risk we are heading towards a cliff edge and time is running out. ""We have been speaking with government and that will be ongoing but there is only a matter of months before the restrictions on our industry will have irreparable long-term damage on our sector."" The Scottish Tourism Alliance said the curfew on pubs and restaurants was ""likely to be the last straw for many businesses which were only just managing to break even"". The Scottish Chambers of Commerce warned that ""stricter measures in Scotland are undeniably more dangerous for the survival of businesses"" and called for more support to be given by both the Scottish and UK governments. The Conservatives said the Scottish government had only hired 874 contact tracers so far, despitesaying in May,externalthat 2,000 contact tracing staff would be required to ""deliver a sustainable service across Scotland"". Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said it was clear that Scotland's test and trace system was ""not working"" and that ""too often the system is overwhelmed"". The new Scottish restrictions are more extensive than those announced by Boris Johnson for England. Nicola Sturgeon has matched the prime minister by introducing a 10pm curfew for bars and restaurants. Table service and some of the other new requirements for England already apply in Scotland. In her Holyrood statement, the first minister said she was aligning with other UK nations ""as far as possible"". She also said her scientific team had advised that the UK government's package ""on its own will not be sufficient"" to bring coronavirus under control. The Scottish government's gone significantly further by extending the West of Scotland ban on visiting others in their own homes nationwide. Nicola Sturgeon said the new rules would be reviewed every three weeks and need not all last for six months - which was the timescale Boris Johnson suggested for his measures. All governments intend to back up their policies with enforcement but there has been no mention of big new fines in Scotland. This is devolved decision making in action in the biggest crisis since the creation of the Scottish Parliament. Some argue divergence across the UK is confusing and undesirable but opinion polls consistently suggest the Scottish public trust Holyrood to set the pace.

New Covid restrictions could last six months - PM,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""It would be tempting to think the threat had faded"" The UK has reached ""a perilous turning point"", Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said, as he set out a raft of new coronavirus restrictions for England which could last for up to six months. Shop staff will have to wear face masks and weddings will be limited to a maximum of 15 people, under the rules. Fines for breaking laws on gatherings and not wearing a mask will increase to Â£200 for a first offence. He also warned ""significantly greater restrictions"" could come if necessary. Mr Johnson said ""similar steps"" would be taken across the UK after he met with the leaders of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland on Tuesday morning. Like England, Scotland's First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, also announced a 22:00 curfew for hospitality businesses. The same measure is also set tocome into force in Waleson Thursday. But Ms Sturgeon went further than England on restrictions,banning the visiting of other households indoors. It comes as the number of UK cases rose by 4,926 on Tuesday,government figures showed,external, with deaths increasing by 37. New rules a balancing act of science and politics How have the rules changed? How many cases are there in your area? Where do I have to wear a face covering now? Weddings: 'We have to phone 15 people and un-invite them' Speaking in the House of Common, the prime minister told MPs: ""We always knew that while we might have driven the virus into retreat, the prospect of a second wave was real. I'm sorry to say that, as in Spain and France and many other countries, we've reached a perilous turning point."" Mr Johnson said the new rules were ""carefully judged"" to achieve the maximum reduction in the R number - which measures how quickly the virus is spreading - while causing ""the minimum damage to lives and livelihoods"". But he said this was ""by no means a return to the full lockdown of March"", with no general instructions to stay at home. Businesses, schools, colleges and universities will remain open. Attendance figures showthe number of schools in England sending home groups of pupils due to Covid-19 incidents quadrupled in a week. This video can not be played Covid restrictions: PM addresses the Commons, telling MPs of new hospitality and face covering rules In the last fortnight, hospital admissions have doubled and Covid-19 is likely to spread faster in winter, Mr Johnson said, adding: ""So this is the moment when we must act."" If these restrictions fail to bring the R number below one - the point where the epidemic is no longer growing - ""then we reserve the right to deploy greater fire power with significantly greater restrictions"" he said. Thelatest R estimate for the whole of the UK is between 1.1 and 1.4. Mr Johnson said: ""We will spare no effort in developing vaccines, treatments, new forms of mass-testing but unless we palpably make progress we should assume that the restrictions that I have announced will remain in place for perhaps six months."" Under the new measures for England: Office workers are being toldto work from home again if possible Penalties for not wearing a mask or gathering in groups of more than six will increase to Â£200 on the first offence From Thursday 24 September, all pubs, bars and restaurants will be restricted to table service only. Takeaways can continue Also from Thursday,hospitality venues must close at 22:00- which means shutting then, not calling for last orders (in Scotland the same curfew rule comes into force on Friday) Face coverings must be worn by taxi drivers and passengers from Wednesday Retail staff and customers in indoor hospitality venues will also have to wear masks from Thursday, except when seated at a table to eat or drink From Monday 28 September, only 15 people will be able to attend weddings and civil partnerships, in groups of six. Funerals can still take place with up to 30 people Also from 28 September, you can only play indoor adult sports in groups of less than six The planned return of spectators to sports venues will now not go ahead from 1 October Mr Johnson also said the government would provide police and local authorities in England with extra funding to enforce the regulations, with the option to draw on military support. Restating her support for people working from home, Scotland's first minister also announced her government might impose a ""legal duty"" on employers to allow home working. Ms Sturgeon said enforcement of coronavirus rules for the public in Scotland was ""under review"", but added: ""Supporting people to do the right thing is much more effective than threatening harsh punishment if they cannot."" The first minister also said the new restrictions on visiting other households would be reviewed every three weeks - and stressed that they would ""not necessarily"" be in place for as long as six months. The new restrictions in England amount to little more than a tinkering around the edges. Last week there was talk of mini lockdowns and circuit breaks. But with hospital admissions and deaths still low, there is a window of opportunity to see what impact these new measures will have. While the rapid growth put forward by the government's chief pandemic advisers on Monday that cases could reach 50,000 a day by mid-October is unlikely to be realised, according to many, the chances are infection rates will continue to climb. This is a virus which can be transmitted silently - people are infectious before symptoms develop, while some do not even develop any - and we are entering the time of year when respiratory illnesses circulate more and deaths start to increase. If and when this happens, the government will need to decide how far it is prepared to go. The same applies for the rest of the UK nations despite the tighter restrictions there on visiting people's homes. A full lockdown is highly unlikely, but more significant steps such as closing hospitality venues, leisure facilities and curbing everyday activities from playing sport to travelling around the country remain options. But the horrible question that will be asked is this: How much economic pain, disruption and damage to wider health and wellbeing is worth the lives that are at risk? The really tough calls are still to come. Read more from Nick. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he supported ""necessary"" stricter measures, but added that families were worried ""the government doesn't have a strategy"". ""One day people were encouraged to work in the office, in fact more than encouraged they were openly challenged by the prime minister for not doing so. Today they're told the opposite,"" he said. ""This is a time of national crisis but we need clear leadership."" This video can not be played Labour leader Keir Starmer accuses the government of not having a ""clear strategy"" for the pandemic Sir Keir also said it would be a ""disaster"" to withdraw the furlough scheme - which is due to end next month - in ""one fell swoop"" with no additional support for people whose jobs might be at risk. The governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey,suggested some sectors may benefit from further targeted help. SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? SUPPORT BUBBLES:What are they and who can be in yours? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? WEDDINGS:Can I have a reception with guests? SOCIAL LIFE:Is it safe to go to the pub? The Confederation of British Industry, which represents business, also called for a targeted replacement for the furlough scheme. ""It has saved thousands and thousands of jobs but there is a cliff-edge looming. And, now, with today's announcement that is more urgent than ever,"" said director general Dame Carolyn Fairbairn. Some business owners said the latest rules would make life even harder. Marc Gough, who runs a crockery and glassware business in the wedding and events sector, said the cut to the limit for weddings to 15 was ""heart breaking"". ""I can't earn a living because you're restricting me to weddings of 15 people,"" Mr Gough told BBC Radio 5 live, adding that the turnover of his business had fallen from Â£750,000 to Â£20,000. ""To walk into that warehouse, to put a smile on my face to the staff that I have left, to the clients that I deal with constantly, the brides, it's truly heart breaking,"" he said.

Join us again tomorrow for more of the latest news on coronavirus as it happens. Today's contributors were Sean Fanning, Chris Clayton, Martha Buckley, Marie Jackson, Georgina Rannard, Doug Faulkner, Jennifer Scott, Penny Spiller, Paul Seddon and Justin Parkinson. If you are just joining us, or have been overwhelmed by the number of announcements, here are some of today's headlines from around the UK:  Thank you for following our coverage
of the coronavirus pandemic. Hereâs a quick reminder of the major stories from around
the world: Among today's announcements is the introduction of a 10pm closing time for the hospitality industry, as well as a table service-only rule. The news has been greeted with concern by businesses in the sector. Tom Stainer, chief executive of the Campaign for Real Ale, said pub customers and publicans wanted to stop the spread of the virus but said the government hadn't shown the evidence that pubs were disproportionately contributing to increased infections. ""It is additional pressure on already fragile pubs which are at real risk of closure,"" he said, pointing out there was currently no support on offer from the government. Mr Stainer added the curfew would cut into several hours of ""high trading times"" at a time when the industry needed to pay off debts after the lockdown. Andy Lennox, founder of Zim Braai restaurants, said his business had lost 30% of its revenue ""overnight"" with the 10pm closing time and it was going to be ""very difficult"". ""The big thing now is what the support going to be, we need some kind of more flexi-furlough brought in that will allow us to add new employees to that, the VAT needs to stay - that 5% is massive,"" he said. Mr Lennox added that Eat Out To Help Out had helped in August - but had only made back losses the industry had already suffered. There have been national protests calling for more protective equipment for health workers The US Congress approved a whopping $3tn emergency funding to fight the coronavirus pandemic back in March. But could it be that some of the money did not go to where it was intended? That is the claim in a Washington Post report, which says $1bn earmarked for the US Defence Department to boost a shortage of medical supplies instead went on patching up gaps in military equipment procurement for items such as jet engines, body armour and uniforms. Some defence contractors, the Washington Post goes on to say, had already tapped into other bail-out measures, such as the job-protection scheme. Analysts say officials are struggling to account for some of the Congress-approved funds. There has been no response yet from the Pentagon. You can read the story in the Washington Posthere,external.  Northern Ireland's First Minister Arlene Foster has described new restrictions in the nation asa ""wake-up call"". She said the ""tough"" new measures, which include banning different households from mixing indoors, were not a second lockdown, while Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neil called for a big push to curb the rise in cases during a joint televised address. Mrs Foster said the actions being taken were ""designed to prevent the need for a return to lockdown"". ""We have risen to the challenge many times before,"" she said. Ms O'Neill said: ""The choices you make could be the difference between life and death for those closest to you."" The new measures came into effect at 18:00. The government has published its updated guidance for coronavirus measure in England, following Boris Johnson's televised address. Here are some the changes: Read the updated guidancehere,external. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey says the PM ""must
take responsibility for what has gone wrong"" with ""his 'world-beating' test-and-trace system"". He calls it ""inexcusable"" that this has been ""overwhelmed"" in recent weeks. West Ham United manager David Moyes and two of his players have tested positive for coronavirus,the club has said. Moyes, 57, defender Issa Diop, 23, and 24-year-old midfielder Josh Cullen will now be required to self-isolate. ""The manager and both players immediately left the stadium and have returned home,"" said a club statement. The club was told of the results ahead of its Carabao Cup tie against Hull City on Tuesday. Pubs, bars and restaurants in Wales must only provide a table service and will have to close at 22:00 from Thursday, the Welsh First Minister has confirmed. In a televised address Mark Drakeford warned: ""In the weeks and months ahead of us, there is a very real possibility we could see coronavirus regain a foothold in our local communities, towns and cities. None of us wants to see that happen again."" He said some parts of south Wales had seen the sharpest rise in cases and were already under strict local measures but said ""we now need to make that difference across Wales"". Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she recognised the latest restrictions may feel like a ""step backwards"", but urged Scots to stick with them, insisting they ""will make a difference"". She said through collective efforts the virus had been beaten back but warned that over winter ""the challenge is once again getting harder"". ""But please know that thanks to all your efforts over the last six months, we are in a much stronger position than in the spring,"" she added. ""Cases are rising but less rapidly than back then."" Analysis Alex ForsythPolitical correspondent While Labour broadly supports the stricter
measures the partyâs criticism centres on two points; the party says the Test
and Trace system isnât working and itâs repeatedly called for more financial
support for sectors that have been adversely affected by restrictions. That
pressureâs growing; including from some on the Tory benches concerned about the
impact of a restricted economy on businesses. For Labour, shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth says the PM should not be ""phasing out"" the furlough scheme, which is due to finish at the end of next month. He tells the BBC preserving public health and the economy does not represent an ""either/or"" choice for the government. Mr Ashworth accuses ministers of ignoring ""all the warnings"" on the coronavirus testing system. Prime Minister Boris Johnson
- in a televised message to the country â reiterated the governmentâs new âtougher
package of measuresâ designed to curb the rise in coronavirus infection. New restrictions for
England are expected to last for the next six months. These include pubs and
restaurants closing from 10pm, the compulsory wearing of face masks and
coverings for shop workers, people advised to work from home âwherever
possibleâ and tougher enforcement of rule-breaking. Thereâs more detail on the new
ruleshere.  Alex ForsythPolitical correspondent Boris
Johnson adopted a similar line to the one he used in Parliament earlier - that of acting now to prevent more onerous restrictions later Both politically and economically, the government is
desperate to avoid another wholesale lockdown and hopes these measures will
help. When he addressed MPs earlier, the PMâs assertion that these new measures might be in
place for six months was stark. Now heâs offering a sprinkling of optimism by
saying things will be better by the spring, but that doesnât mean the country
isnât in for a few tough and uncertain months. Alex ForsythPolitical correspondent Some have suggested the government should
allow people to take more personal risk. Yesterday, the Chief Medical Officer for England, Chris Whitty, said increasing the risk for individuals increased the risk for everyone. Now, Boris Johnson is echoing that refrain, saying ""these risks are not our own"" - with Downing Street pushing a sense of national unity and resolve. The PM tells the UK population: ""Never in our history has our collective destiny and our
collective health depended so completely on our individual behaviour."" There will be ""great days ahead"", he predicts, calling for ""discipline"", ""resolve"" and a ""spirit of togetherness that will carry us through"". That ends Boris Johnson's address. Alex ForsythPolitical correspondent The prime minister says this approach carries the support of the main parliamentary
parties, but itâs not without question. Thereâs still tension in the Conservative party
about whether today's measures go far enough, or indeed too far, and what role Parliament
should have in scrutinising them and signing them off. And Labour is among the opposition voices
calling for more financial support for affected sectors and improvements to the
testing system. This video can not be played Coronavirus: PM says health depends on âindividual behaviourâ Boris Johnson says bringing in extra restrictions now will keep shops and schools open. Meanwhile, the NHS is ""better prepared"" than it was when the pandemic first hit the UK, with personal protective equipment, extra beds and Nightingale hospitals in place, he adds. Doctors and medical advisers are ""rightly worried"" at the moment, the prime minister says, but they are ""unanimous that things will be far better
by the spring"", with the ""hope"" of a vaccine by then and more efficient mass testing. That is the ""hope"" and the ""dream"", he adds. Boris Johnson says he's ""deeply, spiritually reluctant"" to curb civil liberties, but the virus can't be allowed to get out of control or NHS patients with ""non-Covid needs"" will suffer. Another lockdown would threaten jobs and ""the loving human contact"" on which we all depend"", he adds. Education would suffer and loneliness would grow, the PM argues. Alex ForsythPolitical correspondent It goes without saying the prime minister only addresses the
nation when No 10 thinks itâs needed. It is a sign of the extraordinary and
difficult year it's been that this may feel familiar now to some people at home. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Last throw of dice before the really tough call,"The disconnect between scientists and ministers in England could not be more stark. On Monday, the government's two most senior pandemic advisers - Prof Chris Whitty and Sir Patrick Vallance - set out the scale of the problem, raising the prospect of 50,000 cases a day by October. On Tuesday, ministers provided their answer - closing pubs early, asking people to work from home and making face coverings mandatory in a few more situations. But that was about it. In Northern Ireland and Scotland, they went further, banning visits to other people's homes. But even that fell short of the mini-lockdowns and ""circuit breaks"" floated last week. Clearly, there need to be trade-offs between containing the spread of the virus and minimising the impact to society. But there is more to the past two days than that. There is a recognition within government the public is tiring of the battle against coronavirus. Estimates suggest only one in five people is self-isolating fully when asked. And you need only to listen to government adviser Prof Robert Dingwall to realise the problem ministers are facing. Last week, he warned the public was ""just going through the motions"" and had become ""comfortable"" with the idea that thousands would die just as thousands died with flu each year. And this is the context in which Prof Whitty and Sir Patrick took to the screens in Monday. The decision to present the 50,000-cases scenario was discussed carefully in advance I understand. It was based on cases doubling every week from now until the middle of next month. This was happening at one point at the end of August and start of September. But it is far from a given that it will continue - in fact even now the trajectory looks to be below that. They could have referenced the trends Spain and France were on - two countries they mentioned in other parts of the briefing. But they didn't. If they had, this is what it would have looked like. Sir Patrick did point out the 50,000 figure was not a prediction. But it was used in the knowledge it would grab the headlines. Why? One person close to the decision-making told me it was about influencing behaviour - to try to persuade the public to redouble its efforts. That much was clear from Prof Whitty's plea for people to think of others. If anyone increased their own risk of exposure, they also ""increase the risk of everyone"" around them, he said. With the numbers of hospital admissions and deaths still low, there is a window of opportunity before more difficult decisions have to be taken. And that is why the restrictions ministers introduced are somewhat more limited than the scientists' warning might have suggested was needed. Even if the public does take more care - and the fear is the large proportion at minimal risk will not, as taking steps such as self-isolating for 14 days on the basis of close contact with an infected individual can cost people income - it remains doubtful the rise in cases will be halted. That is because the virus is stealthy. People are infectious before symptoms develop - and some remain asymptomatic. On top of that we are entering the time of year when respiratory illnesses circulate more easily. Many experts have questioned whether the 50,000-cases-a-day figure will be reached by mid-October - called implausible by some - but it would still be a big surprise if infection rates do not continue to gradually climb. Prof Paul Hunter, from the University of East Anglia, says it is now ""almost certain"" there will be an increase in the next two to three months. He wants to see more focus on protecting the most vulnerable. And that is likely to happen soon. But the government will still have a big decision to make if it is determined to reduce the number of cases, which the prime minister suggested was its goal. A full lockdown remains highly unlikely. But more significant steps, such as closing hospitality venues and leisure facilities and curbing everyday activities, from playing sport to travelling around the country, remain options. In the end it will come down to how far the government is prepared to go to contain the virus. How much economic pain and disruption and damage to society and the wider health and wellbeing of individuals is worth the lives at risk? That, unfortunately, is the horrible dilemma likely to have to be faced. The really tough calls are still to come.

'We have to phone 15 people and un-invite them',"Tony and Laura have a daughter together and another baby on the way ""We have to phone 15 people and tell them they can't come any more, which is an absolute nightmare,"" says Tony Slade, who is due to get married to fiancee Laura next week. They had already limited their wedding guest list to fewer than 30, in line with the UK government's coronavirus restrictions in England. Now they face a further cull, asBoris Johnson announcedthe maximum number of people allowed at weddings is being cut to 15. ""More than likely we'll probably still go ahead with it,"" says Tony, from Edenbridge in Kent. ""It'll be Laura's family of six and my family of five."" The couple - who have been together for 10 years and have a daughter together - will ""have a long chat about what to do this evening"" and make a decision. ""I don't know how you can have pubs but you can't have weddings,"" he says. ""I understand there's certain things they've got to do but I don't think they're looking at it in the right way. ""You can sit in a Wetherspoons with 100 people back to back but you can't have more than 15 at a wedding, even spaced out."" He adds: ""I'm disappointed. Laura's done all the planning in record time. She had about six of her mates who were bridesmaids who can't come now. My best man and groomsmen can't come either."" What are the rules on weddings? The story of a socially distanced wedding New rules at-a-glance: More face coverings and fines The new rules have not been published yet - but if they are similar tothe current regulations,,externalthe limit will have to include all attendees - including the registrar and suppliers such as photographers. Amy and her fiance Alan are also facing the prospect of having to send out another batch of ""uninvites"" to their wedding. The couple, who live in Cheltenham, originally cut down their wedding guest list of 100 to fewer than 30. ""Upset was the first feeling I had,"" says Amy, of the moment when Mr Johnson announced the rules. ""We had got very excited about our new plan which we just made about three weeks ago. To cut it down again is another blow."" Amy and fiance Alan did not want to be identified ""I don't understand how it fits with the other regulations,"" she says. ""Maybe I can understand them cutting down the reception, but the ceremony as well? Why does that have to be 15 when a church service can have as many as they want?"" Under the current rules,,externalplaces of worship can decide their own limits for services - but not weddings - depending on how many people can safely fit inside while social distancing. With her wedding in one month's time, on 23 October, Amy, 35, who is a teacher, isn't sure what she and her fiance will do, and says they will discuss it properly before deciding. ""People have booked their travel,"" she says, with some guests due to travel from Northern Ireland. ""That's the problem."" Some couples are determined to go ahead with their plans despite the new limit, not wanting to put their lives on hold. ""We just want to get married,"" says James Hoggarth, a chartered accountant from Leamington Spa, who has been engaged to fiancee Lindsay for two years. ""We have already got one child, we want to have another one at some point."" ""It is what it is,"" says James - ""it is the hand that we have been dealt"" They originally had 110 guests planned for their wedding next month, which they then cut down to 30, and will now halve to 15. ""Cutting down the first time was difficult,"" he says. ""To then have to cut it again and have to cut out family is very hard. But it's what you have to do. ""It's difficult. It will almost certainly mean we will end up cutting aunts, uncles, cousins, grandparents. ""It will probably end up being that we end up with the three of us, two registrars and then very close family - parents, siblings, best man and maid of honour."" James adds: ""After the initial shock, I just want to get on with it,"" he says. ""It's not nice but it's unfortunately the world that we live in. We just want to have our day."" But it is not just couples who will be disappointed with the government's change to the rules on weddings. Marc Gough, who runs a crockery and glassware business in the wedding and events sector in Greater Manchester, said the cut to the limit for weddings to 15 was ""heart-breaking"". The wedding industry has ""been completely, utterly decimated"", says Marc Gough ""I have moved nearly 300 weddings already from this year and then to put a restriction of up to 15 for six months, I now have to contact all the brides. We're then possibly going to have to give refunds. ""I can't go back to work, I can't earn a living because you're restricting me to weddings of 15 people,"" Mr Gough said on BBC Radio 5 live. ""We can't make a living."" This video can not be played Beth Johnson and Phil Hobbs had to scale down their wedding day Mr Gough says that before the pandemic, his business Whitehouse Event Crockery had a turnover of Â£750,000.

Pubs in Wales to close at 10pm from Thursday,"This video can not be played ""We cannot let the virus take hold of our lives again"" Pubs, cafes and restaurants in Wales will have to shut at 22:00 every night under new measures to control the rising rate of coronavirus. The rules, to come into force on Thursday, follow a decision by the UK government to do the same in England. In a broadcast address, First Minister Mark Drakeford called for people to avoid unnecessary travel. Sales of alcohol from off-licences and supermarkets after 22:00 will also be stopped. Hospitality businesses will be required to provide table service only. In the recorded statement, Mr Drakeford said there was a very real possibility that Wales could see the virus ""regain a foothold in our local communities, towns and cities"". ""This is a highly infectious virus, we cannot let it take a hold of our lives again. We have come too far to let that happen,"" he said. 'Closing pubs at 10pm halves your takings' His statement came as the Prime Minister called on the public to summon""discipline and the resolve""to follow new rules. Each nation of the UK is tightening restrictions after Mr Johnson, Mr Drakeford and the first ministers of Scotland and Northern Ireland met on Tuesday morning. Pubs in Wales will have to close at 10pm and only offer table service The changes are in addition to the local lockdown restrictions now in force in six areas of Wales, which people cannot travel in or out of without a good excuse such as work or education. Pubs there already have to shut at 23:00, meaning closing times in the six areas will move an hour earlier. Public Health Wales figures reported 281 further cases of coronavirus on Tuesday,the highest number of cases since April. Mr Drakeford said a Â£500 payment would be provided - as planned for England - for those on low incomes to help them if they need to self-isolate. The Welsh Government says it will also strengthen regulations to ensure employers support those who need to quarantine themselves. He reminded viewers that only six people could meet indoors from a single extended household, comprised of up-to four different households. Mr Drakeford asked people to ""think carefully about making journeys."" ""The fewer people we meet and the fewer journeys we make, the safer we all are,"" he said. However, new pan-Wales travel restrictions are not being made in law. These new measures don't change the Wales-wide picture enormously but they do add to the mosaic building up around the country. There are still much tighter restrictions in local lockdown areas so there's increasing complexity in the rules - and a bigger challenge for politicians and public health officials in communicating which rules apply where. And while these rules may be important in tackling the threat of Covid, getting a testing system that can cope with demand and deliver results in a timely and efficient way is also vital. The Conservative health spokesman in the Senedd, Andrew RT Davies, called again for ""hyperlocal lockdowns based on the best available data"" so ""little of Wales and its economy as possible is closed, even temporarily"". ""Safeguarding lives as well as livelihoods, and sheltering the economy, must remain the priorities,"" he said. Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said areas under increased restrictions should see stricter rules on alcohol, with sales from off-licences stopped at 18:00 and either pubs closed indoors completely or ones that do not serve food shut. ""Crucially, these steps must be backed up by sector-specific financial support to affected businesses,"" he said, adding that people from lockdown areas elsewhere in the UK should be banned from coming to Wales. Mark Reckless, Brexit Party Senedd leader, said he was opposed to the ""further lockdowns"" announced by the Welsh Government. He told BBC Wales: ""We think it would be better to trust people's individual judgments as to their risk and the risk of those they live with and make their own decisions depending on the evolution of the virus"". Earlier in the Commons Boris Johnson, who is responsible for coronavirus rules in England, said restrictionscould last six months. The Cwm Taf Morgannwg health board, covering Bridgend, Merthyr Tydfil and Rhondda Cynon Taf, has warned it is a""matter of weeks"",externalbefore a sharp rise in hospital admissions in the area. The tightening of restrictions comes amid a row over whether the announcement should have been made in the Welsh Parliament first. Presiding officer Elin Jones told the Senedd earlier she had been told final decisions ""aren't likely to be made until a little before"" 20:00 BST on Tuesday. After the news of the restrictions broke two hours before the broadcast by Mr Drakeford, Plaid Cymru's Mr Price accused the Welsh Government of treating the Senedd with contempt. Mr Davies of the Welsh Conservatives said it was disrespectful to Ms Jones, a Plaid Cymru Senedd member who oversees the Welsh Parliament. First Minister Mark Drakeford clarified on Wednesday that pubs and restaurants have to stop serving alcohol at 22:00, rather than close completely.

Leighton Buzzard hit by two earthquakes in one day,"The third and fourth earthquake struck on market day in the Bedfordshire town A town in Bedfordshire has experienced two earthquakes in one day. It is the third and fourth time people in Leighton Buzzard have felt tremors in the space of two weeks. The British Geological Survey (BGS) confirmed a 3.0-magnitude earthquake happened just north of the town at about 09:30 BST and a 2.1-magnitude tremor occurred at about 13:40. People reported their houses ""jolting and shaking"" when the larger quake struck. Since 8 September there have been four earthquakes in the town, the BGS confirmed. A 3.5-magnitude earthquake was felt by residents on that day, followed by a 2.1 magnitude tremor on 13 September. Glenn Ford, a BGS seismologist, said the latest two tremors were aftershocks from the first incident, but were ""earthquakes in their own right"". Tuesday afternoon's tremor was ""20 times smaller"" than the one in the morning, but a few people had reported it to the organisation, he added. Matt Stewart, who lives about 1.5 miles (2.4km) from Leighton Buzzard in Eggington, was one of those who felt the larger earthquake, and said the tremors ""almost shook me out of bed"". ""It was as big as the first one, I think,"" he said. ""My wife ran downstairs and said, 'oh no, not another one'. ""It felt like a whoosh and then a boom coming up through the earth, then it shook the house and a couple of pictures fell off the wall upstairs, like the last time."" The British Geological Survey has released seismograms of the 09:30 BST earthquake Mr Stewart described it as ""a horrible feeling"". ""You're just not in control and I'd like to know what's going on, as this is the third one - it's very strange."" The BGS said its provisional data suggested the earthquake originated at a depth of about 6.2 miles (10km). The earth did not move during the morning's tremors quite as much as when the first earthquake hit two weeks ago at magnitude 3.5, was the general opinion of people shopping and working in the town. Wesley Venn said: ""I was sat in the garden having a lovely cup of tea when all of a sudden I saw the fence shaking."" He described it as ""a little tremor, just to remind us that there are earthquakes about, apparently - in Leighton Buzzard"". He added that ""the earth didn't move for me"" during the second quake - which he slept through - but he felt the other larger ones. ""I don't know if we're the San Andreas Fault of Bedfordshire... but it's a claim to fame. ""We will rebuild - where a plate fell off the shelf - we will rebuild."" Resident Wesley Venn joked the town might be ""the San Andreas Fault of Bedfordshire"" Shop staff Carrie Wainer and Sarah Arkle said there was ""a massive bang"" Carrie Wainer, who works in a gift shop, said she heard ""a massive bang"", adding ""that was about it for us"". ""With what 2020's bringing us, this is just another one added on."" Shop owner Anthony Rosier said ""a few things might have moved a couple of inches"" Model railway store owner Anthony Rosier said there were ""two large bangs, the walls and units shook - then peace and quiet"". The latest tremors had been ""a talking point"" and ""brings the buzz back"" to Leighton Buzzard, he said. Mr Ford said: ""It's not an unusual thing to be seen in the UK... this relieves the built-up stress in the rocks."" They were ""nothing to do with fracking or anything like that,"" he said. ""It's typical British tectonic activity that's been going on for hundreds of years."" Mr Ford said the UK experiences about 200 to 300 earthquakes each year, but 90% are ""so minor that people can't perceive them"". While the UK has a few quakes of the same magnitude as Leighton Buzzard each year, it was ""absolutely tiny on the scale of worldwide earthquakes"" and ""more than a billion times smaller than theone that hit Japan in 2011"". He added: ""If they felt this one in Japan, they wouldn't even look up from their morning coffee."" Dr Matthew Blackett, an earthquake expert from Coventry University, said the Leighton Buzzard tremors were likely caused by the fracturing of solid rock in ""hidden fault lines"", several hundred metres below the surface. ""What seems to have happened is that this was an initial earthquake in a hidden fault - some stress or other has caused it. ""These two subsequent events are a readjustment of the fault lines to come back to some sort of stability. ""The crust has to adjust itself to become stable again, that seems to have happened to the poor people of Leighton Buzzard. ""It is quite possible that that sequence is now done, but it might be that there are still stresses there. ""If there are [further tremors], I think it will only be minor events.""

Barclays to send staff back to working from home,"Barclays will tell ""hundreds"" of UK staff who had gone back to the office to return to working from home. The bank told the BBC it was making the move following the latest guidance from the government that people should work at home when they can. About 1,000 Barclays employees worldwide returned to the office over the summer. French bank Societe Generale and insurance giant Lloyd's of London also told UK staff to work from home again. Barclays said it would not be releasing a country-specific number on those returning to work from home. The bank had said it would carry out a ""gradual"" return to the office in October, after chief executive Jess Staley signalled thathe wanted employees working from home during the pandemic to return to the office""over time"". ""It is important to get people back together in physical concentrations,"" he told Bloomberg TV in July. New Covid restrictions could last six months - PM However, not all banks take the same view. NatWest has said staff can continue to work from home until next year. On Tuesday, Societe Generale said it was also ""adapting its position in line with UK government guidance"", without stating the number of workers in its London offices would now work from home. Lloyd's of London said it had told its 800 directly employed staff to work from home but that this did not apply to the independent brokers who use its Lime Street headquarters. ""Lloyd's underwriting room is certified as a Covid-secure environment and will remain open for market participants,"" the company said. Business groups have reacted with dismay to the prime minister's call for people to work at home where they can. The CBI said that it was a ""crushing"" blow that would have a ""devastating impact"". It marks a change in policy followinga government advertising campaign to get people back to workwhere safe. Campaign group London First said it would discourage people from returning to workplaces and risk ""derailing an already fragile recovery"". CBI director-general Carolyn Fairbairn told the BBC: ""We know we need to avoid a second national lockdown at all if we possibly can, but I have to say these are crushing blows. ""The impact on people who are coming back into their offices, the impact on city centres, so dependent on the bustle of city life, our creative industries - this will have a devastating impact on people and businesses. ""And I think that the answer for business, and what I'm hearing in my conversations this morning, is make it a short, sharp shock if it has to happen."" Public transport is still a worry for many people Appearing on the Emma Barnett Show on Radio 5 live, she said she was speaking to the programme from her office and that ""about 15%"" of her people were in. ""They're excited about coming back, we need to plan to bring more people back. It's good for morale, it's good for learning, it's good for creativity and so many businesses are feeling that, so this is a backward move that won't be welcomed, and let's make it as short as it needs to be."" ""The new restrictions must be regularly reviewed to minimise the damage to the economy while safeguarding the health of the nation in the round - not just physical health, but mental health and our economic health, said London First chief executive Jasmine Whitbread. She also called for the government to extend business rates relief and to introduce a ""targeted"" version of the furlough scheme, which is due to end on 31 October. As well as the change in stance on working from home, Boris Johnson also confirmed that pubs and restaurants in England will have to close at 22:00 from Thursday to stop the spread of the coronavirus. He warned that the new measures could last up to six months. Ms Whitbread said: ""A targeted version of the furlough scheme would help those hardest hit in leisure, retail and hospitality."" Roger Barker, director of policy at the Institute of Directors, said the spread of coronavirus was not wholly predictable, but the ""back and forth"" on office working would cause ""frustration"". He added: ""Business leaders are eager for the government to focus on the foundations, issues like childcare, public transport, and getting the testing system firing on all cylinders.""

US-China tensions flare at UN General Assembly,"This video can not be played Trump, Xi Jinping and Guterres address the UN General Assembly Tensions between the US and China came to the fore of the annual UN General Assembly in New York, with US President Donald Trump blaming China for the spread of coronavirus. He called for China to be held ""accountable"" for the pandemic. In his speech, Chinese President Xi Jinping said his country had ""no intention to enter a Cold War with any country"". Ties between the two world powers are strained on a number of fronts. This year's summit at New York is largely being held virtually, with world leaders providing pre-recorded speeches. The new format meant some of the geopolitical theatre normally on offer at the key UN meeting was absent. Each country was represented by a single delegate and there was little opportunity for one nation to rebut another. But as often is the case for speeches to the assembly, President Trump used his address to tout his achievements and tear into a rival. ""We must hold accountable the nation which unleashed this plague on to the world - China,"" he said. ""In the earliest days of the virus China locked down travel domestically, while allowing flights to leave China and infect the world. China condemned my travel ban on their country, even as they cancelled domestic flights and locked citizens in their homes,"" he added. President Trump, whose own record on coronavirus is under close scrutiny as the US heads towards elections, has frequently accused Beijing of covering up the virus, saying they could have stopped the disease spreading. China has called the attacks an unfounded distraction. Is the world entering a new Cold War? Why US-China relations are at a low their lowest point in decades The US death toll for coronavirus, at more than 200,000, is the highest in the world and President Trump has often downplayed the disease. Tensions are high between the US and China on a number of other issues, including trade, technology, Hong Kong and China's treatment of Muslim minorities in Xinjiang province. The US president's speech came in the form of a pre-recorded message Speaking soon after the US leader, President Xi warned of the risks of a ""clash of civilisations"". ""We will continue to narrow differences and resolve disputes with others through dialogue and negotiation. We will not seek to develop only ourselves or engage in zero sum game,"" he said. US to block some exports citing China's human rights abuses US China tariffs 'inconsistent' with trade rules says WTO In remarks released ahead of Tuesday's speech, President Xi took a more overt swipe at the US, saying ""no country has the right to dominate global affairs, control the destiny of others, or keep advantages in development all to itself"", something China itself has been accused of by critics. Also in his speech, President Xi said China - the world's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases -aims to hit peak emissions in 2030 and be carbon neutral by 2060. By Laura Trevelyan, BBC News This was a stump speech by President Trump, who faces re-election in 40 days time. He had Beijing firmly in his sights - blaming what he and his followers call the China virus for taking countless lives. Mr Trump is trying to deflect attention from his own handling of the pandemic by heaping opprobrium on China, while emphasising US efforts to find a cure. We will end the pandemic, the president pledged, saying thanks to US efforts three vaccines are in the final stage of development. For good measure, Mr Trump lumped the UN's World Health Organization into his critique of China - saying the international body, which he's withdrawing US funding from, is virtually controlled by China, blaming it for spreading what he called misinformation about the virus. This was not a subtle speech. It was a clear attempt to shift blame as Americans are already voting in the presidential election. The assembly was opened by UN Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres, who, without naming China or the US warned ""we must do everything to avoid a new Cold War"". ""We are moving in a very dangerous direction,"" he said. ""Our world cannot afford a future where the two largest economies split the globe in a great fracture - each with its own trade and financial rules and internet and artificial intelligence capacities."" He said there was no room for self-interest in the face of the coronavirus. ""Populism and nationalism have failed,"" he said. ""Those approaches to contain the virus have often made things manifestly worse."" President Trump gave a very different vision in his speech, saying ""only when you take care of your own citizens will you find a true basis for co-operation"". In other speeches: French President Emmanuel Macron said the future of the world should not be reduced to the rivalry between the US and China, calling for a ""modern new consensus"" in tackling global challenges Russia's President Vladimir Putin said he wanted to hold an online conference as soon as possible to discuss global co-operation on vaccines and ways to deliver them Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro rejected criticism of his country's environmental policies, saying Brazil was the victim of a ""brutal campaign of misinformation"".

"Get serious about winning, Starmer tells Labour","This video can not be played Sir Keir: ""We still have a lot of work to do"" Sir Keir Starmer has told Labour to ""get serious about winning"" in his first conference speech as leader. Sir Keir attacked Boris Johnson's ""serial incompetence"" and said he was ""just not up to the job"" of being PM. But he said Labour had work to do win back voters' trust - and had deserved to lose the 2019 general election. In an online broadcast, he set out his vision for the UK and urged voters to ""take another look at Labour"", adding: ""We are under new leadership."" And he assured voters who deserted the party in droves in some of its traditional heartlands: ""We love this country as you do."" Starmer speech reaction Starmer faces challenges over patriotism call Labour aims to build trust with new slogan A guide to party conferences in a Covid world The speech was delivered to a near-empty room, in Doncaster, South Yorkshire, because of social distancing restrictions, and was greeted with silence instead of the usual applause and ovations. He criticised the government's handling of the coronavirus pandemic and said the crisis had revealed Boris Johnson as being ""just not serious"" and ""not up to the job"". ""It makes me angry that, just when the country needs leadership, we get serial incompetence,"" said the Labour leader. But he said Labour had to be ""brutally honest"" with itself about why had it had lost four general elections in a row. ""When you lose an election in a democracy you deserve to. You don't look at the electorate and ask them: 'what were you thinking?',"" he told the party. He said Labour was ""becoming a competent, credible Opposition but that's not enough"". And he vowed that ""never again will Labour go into an election not being trusted on national security, with your job, with your community and with your money. That's what being under new leadership means."" Keir Starmer literally stood in front of a red wall in Doncaster, and his key message was to those who had abandoned Labour in 2019 - we hear you. He has something of an innovative policy chief in Claire Ainsley - one who doesn't believe in setting out detailed policies. So he was blatant - clever policy offers aren't enough to win trust. Far more important are values. He emphasised the classic Labour values of ""compassion"" and ""opportunity"", but also stressed the importance of family and security - seen as a weak spot for Labour under Jeremy Corbyn. His message to his own party was more brutal than anticipated - suggesting that it would be a ""betrayal"" to be anything other than relentless in seeking power. But he was also brutal towards the prime minister - Starmer was a serious lawyer when Boris Johnson was writing flippant columns. So far, Starmer's focus as Labour leader has been on competence. Polling suggests this has been successful  - but he has been accused of being managerial, even funereal, in his approach. Today he succeeded in injecting passion into a speech in a near empty hall. His ""new leadership"" is ambitious for change, but he was also ""angry"" that he wasn't in power to achieve it. Labour's four-day online event replaced the party's traditional party conference due to be held in Liverpool, which was cancelled due to the Covid-19 pandemic. In his speech, Sir Keir said the policies on which Labour will fight the next election in 2024 ""won't sound like anything you've heard before"". ""It will sound like the future arriving,"" he said of the party's next manifesto. On Brexit, Sir Keir, who campaigned for a second referendum, declared that Labour would not be a party ""that keeps banging on about Europe"". ""Let me absolutely clear,"" he said, ""the debate between Leave and Remain is over."" He called on the prime minister to secure a trade deal with the EU, and said he would be ""failing Britain"" if he failed to achieve one. He also pledged to fight for the Union, saying: ""We must make the case much more persuasively that we achieve more together than we do alone. ""To stop the Nationalists ripping our country apart by design, and to stop the Tories dismantling it by neglect."" Sir Keir replaced Jeremy Corbyn as leader in the contest that followed December's general election, where the party won fewer Commons seats than any election since 1935. The broadcast Sir Keir's first Labour conference speech since becoming leader in April. On the economy, the Labour leader repeated calls for ""properly funded"" public services and ""huge investment"" in skills to create work opportunities. He also called for action to tackle climate change, and for the government to develop a new strategy to close gaps in education inequality. And he pledged to work ""hand-in-hand"" with both the private sector and trade unions in a bid to create ""high quality jobs"". Momentum, the left wing campaign group originally set up to support Jeremy Corbyn's leadership, said Sir Keir's speech was a ""missed opportunity to show substance"". The group's co-chair, and West Midlands regional secretary of the Fire Brigades Union, Andrew Scattergood, said: ""If Starmer wants to appeal to working class voters, his pitch should be based on solidarity with the working class and defending their interests, not just slogans and platitudes."" He accused the Labour leader of being silent on key issues, including Black Lives Matter and the end of the evictions ban in England - and suggested he was ""rowing back"" on promises made during his leadership campaign, such as taxing the ""super rich"". But Nathan Yeowell, director of Progress, which was originally set up to campaign for Blairite values, tweeted: ""It is so refreshing to have a Labour leader who wants to win."" In a message to supporters after the Labour leader's speech, the Conservative Party said: ""Sir Keir Starmer was a key member of Jeremy Corbyn's top team. ""Even now whilst he pretends to be showing 'new leadership' he can't even name a single one of Corbyn's polices he'd drop.""

Dark web drugs raid leads to 179 arrests,"The dark web ""is not a fairy tale"" said Europol Police forces around the world have seized more than $6.5m (Â£5m) in cash and virtual currencies, as well as drugs and guns in a co-ordinated raid on dark web marketplaces. Some 179 people were arrested across Europe and the US, and 500kg (1,102lb) of drugs and 64 guns confiscated. It ends the ""golden age"" of these underground marketplaces,Europol said,external. ""The hidden internet is no longer hidden"", said Edvardas Sileris, head of Europol's cyber-crime centre. The operation, known as DisrupTor, was a joint effort between the Department of Justice and Europol. It is believed that the criminals engaged in tens of thousands of sales of illicit goods and services across the US and Europe. Drugs seized including fentanyl, oxycodone, methamphetamine, heroin, cocaine, ecstasy and MDMA. Of those arrested 119 were based in the US, two in Canada, 42 in Germany, eight in the Netherlands, four in the UK, three in Austria and one in Sweden. Police are getting better at targeting operations on the dark web - a part of the internet that is accessible only through specialised tools. This latest raid follows the takedown of the Wall Street market last year, which was then thought to be the second-largest illegal online market on the dark web. Mr Sileris said: ""Law enforcement is most effective when working together, and today's announcement sends a strong message to criminals selling or buying illicit goods on the dark web: the hidden internet is no longer hidden and your anonymous activity is not anonymous."" ""With the spike in opioid-related overdose deaths during the Covid-19 pandemic, we recognise that today's announcement is important and timely,"" said FBI director Christopher Wray. Kacey Clark, a researcher at dark web monitoring specialist Digital Shadows said: ""This is another further blow to organised cybercrime. The operation which took down the AlphaBay and Hansa marketplaces three years ago spooked cyber criminals, since it resulted in many follow up prosecutions as law enforcement pieced evidence together - often many months later. ""Wall Street market emerged from these ashes and was the most significant one in existence at the time. It would appear that law enforcement has followed the same pattern and that is why we are seeing arrests today."" Will this truly herald the ""end of the golden era of dark web marketplaces""? In the short-term there could be a big impact. This operation follows other recent incidents that have shaken trust in dark web stores. Last month, another popular marketplace called Empire came to an abrupt close after a suspected ""exit scam"". It's thought the administrators made off with members' funds, leaving customers' wallets empty and vendors needing to rebuild their shops somewhere else. Three other major sites have also been linked to exit scams in the last 12 months. So, the police operation comes at a time when many people may already be questioning their shopping habits. However, as we've seen in the past with big takedowns like AlphaBay, the lure of buying drugs and other illegal items on the internet means there will always be a market. Other sites will try to boost their security and anonymity, and it's likely more marketplaces will sprout up, potentially using even more innovative techniques to make it harder for law enforcement to find them.

Leighton Buzzard hit by two earthquakes in one dayThe British Geological Survey says there was a 3.0-magnitude tremor followed by a 2.1-magnitude one.,"The third and fourth earthquake struck on market day in the Bedfordshire town A town in Bedfordshire has experienced two earthquakes in one day. It is the third and fourth time people in Leighton Buzzard have felt tremors in the space of two weeks. The British Geological Survey (BGS) confirmed a 3.0-magnitude earthquake happened just north of the town at about 09:30 BST and a 2.1-magnitude tremor occurred at about 13:40. People reported their houses ""jolting and shaking"" when the larger quake struck. Since 8 September there have been four earthquakes in the town, the BGS confirmed. A 3.5-magnitude earthquake was felt by residents on that day, followed by a 2.1 magnitude tremor on 13 September. Glenn Ford, a BGS seismologist, said the latest two tremors were aftershocks from the first incident, but were ""earthquakes in their own right"". Tuesday afternoon's tremor was ""20 times smaller"" than the one in the morning, but a few people had reported it to the organisation, he added. Matt Stewart, who lives about 1.5 miles (2.4km) from Leighton Buzzard in Eggington, was one of those who felt the larger earthquake, and said the tremors ""almost shook me out of bed"". ""It was as big as the first one, I think,"" he said. ""My wife ran downstairs and said, 'oh no, not another one'. ""It felt like a whoosh and then a boom coming up through the earth, then it shook the house and a couple of pictures fell off the wall upstairs, like the last time."" The British Geological Survey has released seismograms of the 09:30 BST earthquake Mr Stewart described it as ""a horrible feeling"". ""You're just not in control and I'd like to know what's going on, as this is the third one - it's very strange."" The BGS said its provisional data suggested the earthquake originated at a depth of about 6.2 miles (10km). The earth did not move during the morning's tremors quite as much as when the first earthquake hit two weeks ago at magnitude 3.5, was the general opinion of people shopping and working in the town. Wesley Venn said: ""I was sat in the garden having a lovely cup of tea when all of a sudden I saw the fence shaking."" He described it as ""a little tremor, just to remind us that there are earthquakes about, apparently - in Leighton Buzzard"". He added that ""the earth didn't move for me"" during the second quake - which he slept through - but he felt the other larger ones. ""I don't know if we're the San Andreas Fault of Bedfordshire... but it's a claim to fame. ""We will rebuild - where a plate fell off the shelf - we will rebuild."" Resident Wesley Venn joked the town might be ""the San Andreas Fault of Bedfordshire"" Shop staff Carrie Wainer and Sarah Arkle said there was ""a massive bang"" Carrie Wainer, who works in a gift shop, said she heard ""a massive bang"", adding ""that was about it for us"". ""With what 2020's bringing us, this is just another one added on."" Shop owner Anthony Rosier said ""a few things might have moved a couple of inches"" Model railway store owner Anthony Rosier said there were ""two large bangs, the walls and units shook - then peace and quiet"". The latest tremors had been ""a talking point"" and ""brings the buzz back"" to Leighton Buzzard, he said. Mr Ford said: ""It's not an unusual thing to be seen in the UK... this relieves the built-up stress in the rocks."" They were ""nothing to do with fracking or anything like that,"" he said. ""It's typical British tectonic activity that's been going on for hundreds of years."" Mr Ford said the UK experiences about 200 to 300 earthquakes each year, but 90% are ""so minor that people can't perceive them"". While the UK has a few quakes of the same magnitude as Leighton Buzzard each year, it was ""absolutely tiny on the scale of worldwide earthquakes"" and ""more than a billion times smaller than theone that hit Japan in 2011"". He added: ""If they felt this one in Japan, they wouldn't even look up from their morning coffee."" Dr Matthew Blackett, an earthquake expert from Coventry University, said the Leighton Buzzard tremors were likely caused by the fracturing of solid rock in ""hidden fault lines"", several hundred metres below the surface. ""What seems to have happened is that this was an initial earthquake in a hidden fault - some stress or other has caused it. ""These two subsequent events are a readjustment of the fault lines to come back to some sort of stability. ""The crust has to adjust itself to become stable again, that seems to have happened to the poor people of Leighton Buzzard.

"World must prevent new Cold War, UN chief warns","This video can not be played Trump, Xi Jinping and Guterres address the UN General Assembly Tensions between the US and China came to the fore of the annual UN General Assembly in New York, with US President Donald Trump blaming China for the spread of coronavirus. He called for China to be held ""accountable"" for the pandemic. In his speech, Chinese President Xi Jinping said his country had ""no intention to enter a Cold War with any country"". Ties between the two world powers are strained on a number of fronts. This year's summit at New York is largely being held virtually, with world leaders providing pre-recorded speeches. The new format meant some of the geopolitical theatre normally on offer at the key UN meeting was absent. Each country was represented by a single delegate and there was little opportunity for one nation to rebut another. But as often is the case for speeches to the assembly, President Trump used his address to tout his achievements and tear into a rival. ""We must hold accountable the nation which unleashed this plague on to the world - China,"" he said. ""In the earliest days of the virus China locked down travel domestically, while allowing flights to leave China and infect the world. China condemned my travel ban on their country, even as they cancelled domestic flights and locked citizens in their homes,"" he added. President Trump, whose own record on coronavirus is under close scrutiny as the US heads towards elections, has frequently accused Beijing of covering up the virus, saying they could have stopped the disease spreading. China has called the attacks an unfounded distraction. Is the world entering a new Cold War? Why US-China relations are at a low their lowest point in decades The US death toll for coronavirus, at more than 200,000, is the highest in the world and President Trump has often downplayed the disease. Tensions are high between the US and China on a number of other issues, including trade, technology, Hong Kong and China's treatment of Muslim minorities in Xinjiang province. The US president's speech came in the form of a pre-recorded message Speaking soon after the US leader, President Xi warned of the risks of a ""clash of civilisations"". ""We will continue to narrow differences and resolve disputes with others through dialogue and negotiation. We will not seek to develop only ourselves or engage in zero sum game,"" he said. US to block some exports citing China's human rights abuses US China tariffs 'inconsistent' with trade rules says WTO In remarks released ahead of Tuesday's speech, President Xi took a more overt swipe at the US, saying ""no country has the right to dominate global affairs, control the destiny of others, or keep advantages in development all to itself"", something China itself has been accused of by critics. Also in his speech, President Xi said China - the world's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases -aims to hit peak emissions in 2030 and be carbon neutral by 2060. By Laura Trevelyan, BBC News This was a stump speech by President Trump, who faces re-election in 40 days time. He had Beijing firmly in his sights - blaming what he and his followers call the China virus for taking countless lives. Mr Trump is trying to deflect attention from his own handling of the pandemic by heaping opprobrium on China, while emphasising US efforts to find a cure. We will end the pandemic, the president pledged, saying thanks to US efforts three vaccines are in the final stage of development. For good measure, Mr Trump lumped the UN's World Health Organization into his critique of China - saying the international body, which he's withdrawing US funding from, is virtually controlled by China, blaming it for spreading what he called misinformation about the virus. This was not a subtle speech. It was a clear attempt to shift blame as Americans are already voting in the presidential election. The assembly was opened by UN Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres, who, without naming China or the US warned ""we must do everything to avoid a new Cold War"". ""We are moving in a very dangerous direction,"" he said. ""Our world cannot afford a future where the two largest economies split the globe in a great fracture - each with its own trade and financial rules and internet and artificial intelligence capacities."" He said there was no room for self-interest in the face of the coronavirus. ""Populism and nationalism have failed,"" he said. ""Those approaches to contain the virus have often made things manifestly worse."" President Trump gave a very different vision in his speech, saying ""only when you take care of your own citizens will you find a true basis for co-operation"". In other speeches: French President Emmanuel Macron said the future of the world should not be reduced to the rivalry between the US and China, calling for a ""modern new consensus"" in tackling global challenges Russia's President Vladimir Putin said he wanted to hold an online conference as soon as possible to discuss global co-operation on vaccines and ways to deliver them Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro rejected criticism of his country's environmental policies, saying Brazil was the victim of a ""brutal campaign of misinformation"".

Schools sending home pupils quadruples in a week,"The number of schools in England sending home groups of pupils because of Covid-19 incidents has quadrupled in a week, according to the latest official figures. Based on attendance last Thursday, they show 4% of schools not fully open because of confirmed or suspected cases - up from 1% the previous week. This could mean about 900 schools sending home pupils. Overall attendance has also dipped slightly from 88% to 87%. This means over a million children were off school that day, whether from Covid-related or other reasons, with more pupils missing from secondary schools than primary. The fall in attendance should ""ring alarm bells"" for the government, said Paul Whiteman, leader of the National Association of Head Teachers. ""Clearly the failure of Covid testing sits at the heart of this. The inability of staff and families to successfully get tested when they display symptoms means that schools are struggling with staffing, children are missing school, and ultimately that children's education is being needlessly disrupted,"" said Mr Whiteman. 88% of pupils back in school for start of term Children's commissioner says one in 20 off with Covid-related issues Heads warn of staff shortages without Covid tests for teachers Booking Covid test like 'getting Harry Potter tickets' This is the second set of Department for Education attendance figures since schools returned in the autumn - and they show a significant increase in schools sending home groups of pupils or whole year groups because of concerns about coronavirus. But they also show the number of schools which were fully open had increased - up from 92% to 94% - because the previous week's figures included schools that were still carrying out a phased start to the year or holding teacher training days. The figures, based on responses from 76% of state schools, show almost no schools being completely closed - with 99.9% recorded as open. This combination of more schools completing their reopening - and at the same time more schools sending pupils home because of Covid-19 - meant that the overall attendance figure balanced out as being similar to the previous week, from 88% to 87%. This is well below what would be expected, with attendance rates usually around 95%. An even lower proportion of vulnerable children, such as those with a social worker, were recorded as being at school, with an attendance rate of 81%. Geoff Barton, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union, said that with rising rates of infection and problems with Covid testing, the attendance figures were ""not at all surprising"". ""Frankly, it is a great relief that the situation is not a lot worse,"" said Mr Barton, who warned that even though schools were ""working incredibly hard to manage this very difficult situation"" it was going to be a ""long, hard winter"". Problems with getting Covid tests was making it harder for schools, said Kevin Courtney, joint leader of the National Education Union. ""This is eroding trust among parents, and it will be an uphill struggle for it to be regained,"" he warned. THE LIFE SCIENTIFIC:In charge of one the most successful Covid-19 vaccine projects in the world YOUR WORK, YOUR MONEY:Financial help if youâre forced to quarantine Education Secretary Gavin Williamson welcomed that 99.9% of schools were open, but said: ""As we would expect, this data shows a small number of pupils are self-isolating in line with public health advice."" He said schools were working ""tremendously hard to ensure protective measures are in place to reduce the risks of transmission"" and they had ""access to timely advice and support through our helpline if they have a positive case"".

Town hit by third earthquake in two weeks,"The third and fourth earthquake struck on market day in the Bedfordshire town A town in Bedfordshire has experienced two earthquakes in one day. It is the third and fourth time people in Leighton Buzzard have felt tremors in the space of two weeks.

The latest tremors had been ""a talking point"" and ""brings the buzz back"" to Leighton Buzzard, he said. Mr Ford said: ""It's not an unusual thing to be seen in the UK... this relieves the built-up stress in the rocks."" They were ""nothing to do with fracking or anything like that,"" he said. ""It's typical British tectonic activity that's been going on for hundreds of years."" Mr Ford said the UK experiences about 200 to 300 earthquakes each year, but 90% are ""so minor that people can't perceive them"". While the UK has a few quakes of the same magnitude as Leighton Buzzard each year, it was ""absolutely tiny on the scale of worldwide earthquakes"" and ""more than a billion times smaller than theone that hit Japan in 2011"". He added: ""If they felt this one in Japan, they wouldn't even look up from their morning coffee."" Dr Matthew Blackett, an earthquake expert from Coventry University, said the Leighton Buzzard tremors were likely caused by the fracturing of solid rock in ""hidden fault lines"", several hundred metres below the surface. ""What seems to have happened is that this was an initial earthquake in a hidden fault - some stress or other has caused it. ""These two subsequent events are a readjustment of the fault lines to come back to some sort of stability. ""The crust has to adjust itself to become stable again, that seems to have happened to the poor people of Leighton Buzzard. ""It is quite possible that that sequence is now done, but it might be that there are still stresses there. ""If there are [further tremors], I think it will only be minor events.""

Prime minister confirms fan return is off,"Brighton hosted Chelsea in a friendly in August that saw 2,500 fans attend with social distancing in place Fans may not to be able to return to watch live sporting events in England until the end of March at the earliest. At a meeting on Tuesday, sports governing bodies - including those from football, rugby, cricket, Formula 1 and horse racing - were told to prepare for no spectators throughout the winter. Officials from the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) told the meeting, which was attended by Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden, that the ban on fans will be kept under review. Premiership Rugby chief executive Darren Childs said: ""The announcement that supporters will not be allowed into stadiums for up to six months cuts off crucial revenue for clubs who have already suffered significant financial losses from suspending the season and playing matches behind closed doors since March. ""We believe the lack of supporters in our grounds could cause irreparable damage to our clubs and the communities they serve, so we must find a way forward to avoid this."" Ralph Rimmer, the chief executive of the Rugby Football League (RFL), added: ""Today's call specifically focused on the postponement of the pilot event programme and the plans for socially distanced crowds and the further serious impact this will now have on sports. ""The secretary of state indicated that the postponement may last throughout the winter. The impact on rugby league and other sports is profound."" Earlier on Tuesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson outlined a range of new restrictions for the country, including confirmation that plans to allow fans to return to sport from 1 October would not go ahead. The plans had beenplaced under reviewearlier this month after a rise in coronavirus cases. The UK's Covid-19 alert level has moved to 4, meaning transmission is ""high or rising exponentially"". The prime minister also said restrictions are likely to remain in place for the next six months. ""We have to acknowledge the spread of the virus is now affecting our ability to reopen large sporting events,"" said the prime minister. 'Delayed return of fans is devastating for clubs, their employees and local businesses' Premier League clubs consider alternatives after proposed return of fans scrapped In an address to the Commons on Tuesday, Johnson announced new restrictions for the country and those included the halting of the phased return of fans. ""We will not be able to do this from 1 October and I recognise the implications for our sports clubs, which are the life and soul of our communities,"" he added. ""The chancellor and the culture secretary are working urgently on what we can do now to support them."" The pilot programme, which was to trial events of up to 1,000 spectators, has also been paused. Two Premiership rugby union matches - Bath v Gloucester on Tuesday and Bristol v Leicester next week - will now be played behind closed doors, as will a horse racing meeting at Newmarket later this week. The majority of sports in England have been played behind closed doors since the coronavirus lockdown in March, including Premier League football fixtures and the FA Cup final, England's Test cricket matches and two Formula 1 races at Silverstone. This video can not be played How long can football clubs survive without the return of fans in the stadium? Sport events that took place with full crowds in March shortly before all fixtures were postponed and the UK locked down have come under scrutiny. The impact of Liverpool's Champions League fixture against Atletico Madrid on the spread of coronavirus is beinginvestigated by the city's council,while there have also been calls for an investigation into whether horse racing's Cheltenham Festivalshould have gone ahead. The government defended its decision to allow such events to proceed before restrictions on mass gatherings were introduced. ""People look back now at the beginning of the pandemic at some of the major sporting events then and ask the question why were they allowed to go ahead,"" said Cabinet Secretary Michael Gove on BBC Breakfast earlier on Tuesday. ""What we must do is look at sporting events now with caution but we also recognise that sport is a vital part of this nation and we're looking at everything we can do to support our athletes, our great clubs, through what will be a challenging time."" Julian Knight, the chair of the DCMS select committee, said: ""If we don't find a route map with smart solutions to allow sports and live events to gradually reopen, we risk decimation of our sporting and cultural infrastructure."" The leaders of more than 100 sports bodies have written to the prime minister to ask for emergency funding,warning of ""a lost generation of activity""because of coronavirus. Sport England has handed out Â£200m for emergency cases, but many in the sector believe more is needed. Earlier this month, Premier League chief executive Richard Masters told BBC Sportit was ""absolutely critical""fans were allowed back inside stadiums as soon as possible and failure to do so would cost clubs Â£700m during the 2020-21 season. English Football League (EFL) clubs lost Â£50m in gate receipts last season andestimate a Â£200m lossif there are no fans this season. The Rugby Football Union (RFU) said no spectators at the forthcoming Autumn Nations Cup or Six Nations will result in losses of Â£60m. RFL chief executive Rimmerurged the government not to delay the return of crowds,with clubs facing a potential impact on revenues of ""up to Â£2m per week"". At the end of August, 2,500 people watched a friendly between Brighton and Chelsea at the Seagulls' Amex Stadium - the first time fans had been allowed into a Premier League ground for almost six months. About 300 spectatorswere allowed to watchlast month's World Snooker Championship final between Ronnie O'Sullivan and Kyren Wilson at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield, but original plans to admit fans for all days of the tournament were reversed. Arsenal's 9-1 victory over West Ham in the Women's Super League on 12 September saw up to 1,000 fans attend. More than 2,500 spectators bought tickets for the first day of the St Leger meeting at Doncaster on 9 September, the first crowd at a British horse racing fixture in six months - but the rest of the meeting wasthen held behind closed doors. Also on Tuesday, it was confirmed that indoor recreational team sports such as netball, basketball and five-a-side football will not be able to continue under the new restrictions, which limit numbers taking part to six. Larger fitness classes will be permitted, as long as they are organised so those taking part do not mix in groups of more than six. Elite indoor sports are exempt, as are indoor sports played by children. This is grim news for British sport, which teeters on the brink of an unprecedented crisis. On one hand, it is no surprise, given rising cases of Covid-19, tighter restrictions and the criticism the government received for allowing events like the Cheltenham Festival to continue in March and not shutting down sooner. The optics of allowing thousands of fans to travel to grounds while encouraging people to work from home was also seen as insurmountable. But it will infuriate sports governing bodies that insist it is much safer for fans to be in highly regulated, socially distanced, often open-air venues and stadiums than watching on the TV in pubs, for instance. They are not aware of any data or research which proves the return of fans would increase transmission. And they point to the fact that countries like Germany are allowing thousands of fans back inside grounds. Sports are now being warned to brace themselves for several months without fans and report back to DCMS officials what impact this will have on their finances. For the EFL and rugby clubs in particular, where matchday revenue is crucial, the answer will be potentially devastating. From non-league football and Olympic sports, through to grassroots clubs and community leisure facilities, the sector fears an existential crisis which could cost thousands of jobs and result in a slump in participation. Pressure will now build on the government to come up with a similar emergency fund to the Â£1.57bn bailout the arts sector was handed in the summer. Calls for the Premier League to help prop up the football pyramid will also intensify.

"Dark web drugs raid leads to 179 arrestsAbout 500kg of cocaine, heroin and other drugs have been seized as well as guns.Technology","The dark web ""is not a fairy tale"" said Europol Police forces around the world have seized more than $6.5m (Â£5m) in cash and virtual currencies, as well as drugs and guns in a co-ordinated raid on dark web marketplaces. Some 179 people were arrested across Europe and the US, and 500kg (1,102lb) of drugs and 64 guns confiscated. It ends the ""golden age"" of these underground marketplaces,Europol said,external. ""The hidden internet is no longer hidden"", said Edvardas Sileris, head of Europol's cyber-crime centre. The operation, known as DisrupTor, was a joint effort between the Department of Justice and Europol. It is believed that the criminals engaged in tens of thousands of sales of illicit goods and services across the US and Europe. Drugs seized including fentanyl, oxycodone, methamphetamine, heroin, cocaine, ecstasy and MDMA. Of those arrested 119 were based in the US, two in Canada, 42 in Germany, eight in the Netherlands, four in the UK, three in Austria and one in Sweden. Police are getting better at targeting operations on the dark web - a part of the internet that is accessible only through specialised tools. This latest raid follows the takedown of the Wall Street market last year, which was then thought to be the second-largest illegal online market on the dark web. Mr Sileris said: ""Law enforcement is most effective when working together, and today's announcement sends a strong message to criminals selling or buying illicit goods on the dark web: the hidden internet is no longer hidden and your anonymous activity is not anonymous."" ""With the spike in opioid-related overdose deaths during the Covid-19 pandemic, we recognise that today's announcement is important and timely,"" said FBI director Christopher Wray. Kacey Clark, a researcher at dark web monitoring specialist Digital Shadows said: ""This is another further blow to organised cybercrime. The operation which took down the AlphaBay and Hansa marketplaces three years ago spooked cyber criminals, since it resulted in many follow up prosecutions as law enforcement pieced evidence together - often many months later. ""Wall Street market emerged from these ashes and was the most significant one in existence at the time. It would appear that law enforcement has followed the same pattern and that is why we are seeing arrests today."" Will this truly herald the ""end of the golden era of dark web marketplaces""? In the short-term there could be a big impact. This operation follows other recent incidents that have shaken trust in dark web stores. Last month, another popular marketplace called Empire came to an abrupt close after a suspected ""exit scam"". It's thought the administrators made off with members' funds, leaving customers' wallets empty and vendors needing to rebuild their shops somewhere else. Three other major sites have also been linked to exit scams in the last 12 months. So, the police operation comes at a time when many people may already be questioning their shopping habits. However, as we've seen in the past with big takedowns like AlphaBay, the lure of buying drugs and other illegal items on the internet means there will always be a market. Other sites will try to boost their security and anonymity, and it's likely more marketplaces will sprout up, potentially using even more innovative techniques to make it harder for law enforcement to find them.

Join us again tomorrow for more of the latest news on coronavirus as it happens. Today's contributors were Sean Fanning, Chris Clayton, Martha Buckley, Marie Jackson, Georgina Rannard, Doug Faulkner, Jennifer Scott, Penny Spiller, Paul Seddon and Justin Parkinson. If you are just joining us, or have been overwhelmed by the number of announcements, here are some of today's headlines from around the UK:  Thank you for following our coverage
of the coronavirus pandemic. Hereâs a quick reminder of the major stories from around
the world: Among today's announcements is the introduction of a 10pm closing time for the hospitality industry, as well as a table service-only rule. The news has been greeted with concern by businesses in the sector. Tom Stainer, chief executive of the Campaign for Real Ale, said pub customers and publicans wanted to stop the spread of the virus but said the government hadn't shown the evidence that pubs were disproportionately contributing to increased infections. ""It is additional pressure on already fragile pubs which are at real risk of closure,"" he said, pointing out there was currently no support on offer from the government. Mr Stainer added the curfew would cut into several hours of ""high trading times"" at a time when the industry needed to pay off debts after the lockdown. Andy Lennox, founder of Zim Braai restaurants, said his business had lost 30% of its revenue ""overnight"" with the 10pm closing time and it was going to be ""very difficult"". ""The big thing now is what the support going to be, we need some kind of more flexi-furlough brought in that will allow us to add new employees to that, the VAT needs to stay - that 5% is massive,"" he said. Mr Lennox added that Eat Out To Help Out had helped in August - but had only made back losses the industry had already suffered. There have been national protests calling for more protective equipment for health workers The US Congress approved a whopping $3tn emergency funding to fight the coronavirus pandemic back in March. But could it be that some of the money did not go to where it was intended? That is the claim in a Washington Post report, which says $1bn earmarked for the US Defence Department to boost a shortage of medical supplies instead went on patching up gaps in military equipment procurement for items such as jet engines, body armour and uniforms. Some defence contractors, the Washington Post goes on to say, had already tapped into other bail-out measures, such as the job-protection scheme. Analysts say officials are struggling to account for some of the Congress-approved funds. There has been no response yet from the Pentagon. You can read the story in the Washington Posthere,external.  Northern Ireland's First Minister Arlene Foster has described new restrictions in the nation asa ""wake-up call"". She said the ""tough"" new measures, which include banning different households from mixing indoors, were not a second lockdown, while Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neil called for a big push to curb the rise in cases during a joint televised address. Mrs Foster said the actions being taken were ""designed to prevent the need for a return to lockdown"". ""We have risen to the challenge many times before,"" she said. Ms O'Neill said: ""The choices you make could be the difference between life and death for those closest to you."" The new measures came into effect at 18:00. The government has published its updated guidance for coronavirus measure in England, following Boris Johnson's televised address. Here are some the changes: Read the updated guidancehere,external. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey says the PM ""must
take responsibility for what has gone wrong"" with ""his 'world-beating' test-and-trace system"". He calls it ""inexcusable"" that this has been ""overwhelmed"" in recent weeks. West Ham United manager David Moyes and two of his players have tested positive for coronavirus,the club has said. Moyes, 57, defender Issa Diop, 23, and 24-year-old midfielder Josh Cullen will now be required to self-isolate. ""The manager and both players immediately left the stadium and have returned home,"" said a club statement. The club was told of the results ahead of its Carabao Cup tie against Hull City on Tuesday. Pubs, bars and restaurants in Wales must only provide a table service and will have to close at 22:00 from Thursday, the Welsh First Minister has confirmed. In a televised address Mark Drakeford warned: ""In the weeks and months ahead of us, there is a very real possibility we could see coronavirus regain a foothold in our local communities, towns and cities. None of us wants to see that happen again."" He said some parts of south Wales had seen the sharpest rise in cases and were already under strict local measures but said ""we now need to make that difference across Wales"". Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she recognised the latest restrictions may feel like a ""step backwards"", but urged Scots to stick with them, insisting they ""will make a difference"". She said through collective efforts the virus had been beaten back but warned that over winter ""the challenge is once again getting harder"". ""But please know that thanks to all your efforts over the last six months, we are in a much stronger position than in the spring,"" she added. ""Cases are rising but less rapidly than back then."" Analysis Alex ForsythPolitical correspondent While Labour broadly supports the stricter
measures the partyâs criticism centres on two points; the party says the Test
and Trace system isnât working and itâs repeatedly called for more financial
support for sectors that have been adversely affected by restrictions. That
pressureâs growing; including from some on the Tory benches concerned about the
impact of a restricted economy on businesses. For Labour, shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth says the PM should not be ""phasing out"" the furlough scheme, which is due to finish at the end of next month. He tells the BBC preserving public health and the economy does not represent an ""either/or"" choice for the government. Mr Ashworth accuses ministers of ignoring ""all the warnings"" on the coronavirus testing system. Prime Minister Boris Johnson
- in a televised message to the country â reiterated the governmentâs new âtougher
package of measuresâ designed to curb the rise in coronavirus infection. New restrictions for
England are expected to last for the next six months. These include pubs and
restaurants closing from 10pm, the compulsory wearing of face masks and
coverings for shop workers, people advised to work from home âwherever
possibleâ and tougher enforcement of rule-breaking. Thereâs more detail on the new
ruleshere.  Alex ForsythPolitical correspondent Boris
Johnson adopted a similar line to the one he used in Parliament earlier - that of acting now to prevent more onerous restrictions later Both politically and economically, the government is
desperate to avoid another wholesale lockdown and hopes these measures will
help. When he addressed MPs earlier, the PMâs assertion that these new measures might be in
place for six months was stark. Now heâs offering a sprinkling of optimism by
saying things will be better by the spring, but that doesnât mean the country
isnât in for a few tough and uncertain months. Alex ForsythPolitical correspondent Some have suggested the government should
allow people to take more personal risk. Yesterday, the Chief Medical Officer for England, Chris Whitty, said increasing the risk for individuals increased the risk for everyone. Now, Boris Johnson is echoing that refrain, saying ""these risks are not our own"" - with Downing Street pushing a sense of national unity and resolve. The PM tells the UK population: ""Never in our history has our collective destiny and our
collective health depended so completely on our individual behaviour."" There will be ""great days ahead"", he predicts, calling for ""discipline"", ""resolve"" and a ""spirit of togetherness that will carry us through"". That ends Boris Johnson's address. Alex ForsythPolitical correspondent The prime minister says this approach carries the support of the main parliamentary
parties, but itâs not without question. Thereâs still tension in the Conservative party
about whether today's measures go far enough, or indeed too far, and what role Parliament
should have in scrutinising them and signing them off. And Labour is among the opposition voices
calling for more financial support for affected sectors and improvements to the
testing system. This video can not be played Coronavirus: PM says health depends on âindividual behaviourâ Boris Johnson says bringing in extra restrictions now will keep shops and schools open. Meanwhile, the NHS is ""better prepared"" than it was when the pandemic first hit the UK, with personal protective equipment, extra beds and Nightingale hospitals in place, he adds. Doctors and medical advisers are ""rightly worried"" at the moment, the prime minister says, but they are ""unanimous that things will be far better
by the spring"", with the ""hope"" of a vaccine by then and more efficient mass testing. That is the ""hope"" and the ""dream"", he adds. Boris Johnson says he's ""deeply, spiritually reluctant"" to curb civil liberties, but the virus can't be allowed to get out of control or NHS patients with ""non-Covid needs"" will suffer. Another lockdown would threaten jobs and ""the loving human contact"" on which we all depend"", he adds. Education would suffer and loneliness would grow, the PM argues. Alex ForsythPolitical correspondent It goes without saying the prime minister only addresses the
nation when No 10 thinks itâs needed. It is a sign of the extraordinary and
difficult year it's been that this may feel familiar now to some people at home. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Scotland faces tighter restrictions 'within days',"This video can not be played Covid in Scotland: FM says tighter restrictions expected 'within days' Additional lockdown restrictions will ""almost certainly"" be put in place in Scotland in the next couple of days, Nicola Sturgeon has said. Speaking at her daily briefing, the first minister said ""fast and urgent action"" was needed to tackle the growth of the virus. Ms Sturgeon indicated that a package of new restrictions would be announced within the next 48 hours. A total of 255 new cases were recorded in the past 24 hours. That represented 6.3% of those tested, the third day running the ""positivity rate"" has exceeded 5% - which the World Health Organization has said is a key benchmark for a virus to be considered under control. Covid in Scotland - Latest updates Coronavirus in Scotland: Four numbers to watch Covid curbs of six months 'more realistic position' While no new deaths were reported, the number of people treated in hospital rose to 73, an increase of 10. Ms Sturgeon said: ""I need to be absolutely straight with people across Scotland, that additional restrictions will almost certainly be put in place in Scotland over the next couple of days. ""Hopefully this will be with four-nations alignment, but if necessary it will have to happen without that."" She said a meeting of the UK government's Cobra emergency committee would take place, and that she would be speaking to Prime Minister Boris Johnson directly after the briefing. Ms Sturgeon added: ""In that call, I will impress upon the prime minister my view that we need decisive, urgent and, as far as possible given our individual responsibilities, co-ordinated action across the UK. ""I will be clear that I am willing to allow a bit more time for four-nations discussions to take place before making final decisions for Scotland, but I will be equally clear that the urgency of this situation will mean that we cannot, must not and will not wait too long."" Later on Monday the UK's chief medical officers said the coronavirus alert level should move to Level 4, meaning that transmission of the virus was ""high or rising exponentially"". Downing Street confirmed Boris Johnson had spoken on the phone to the first ministers of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, and that they would be taking part in a Cobra meeting scheduled for Tuesday morning. A spokesperson said: ""They all agreed to act with a united approach, as much as possible, in the days and weeks ahead."" Ms Sturgeon tweeted that she would make a statement to the Scottish Parliament on Tuesday afternoon. It is indeed a critical time in the trajectory of this virus.  Cases are going up at a time when we are heading towards winter and the NHS will also have to deal with seasonal flu. The first minister says ""difficult decisions"" are to be made in this trade-off. We are being told to prepare for further restrictions on daily life. The government says keeping schools open and protecting the NHS are priorities, so what else will have to give? One of the government's own advisers has said travel restrictions and pub curfews could feature. We are in uncharted waters and no-one can predict what the winter will bring. What is clear is that we are all going to have to find ways to live with this virus for much longer than the next six months. Ms Sturgeon gave no detail of what new restrictions would be introduced, but said the government was ""very close to a point of decision"". ""At the heart of this decision is a simple truth - the longer we wait to introduce new measures, the longer these measures are likely to be in place,"" she said. ""If we move sharply now to get the virus back under control we can minimise the time we all spend under any new restrictions."" Public health expert Prof Linda Bauld said the likely options could include travel restrictions and curfews or restrictions on hospitality. This video can not be played Prof Linda Bauld: Hospitality curfews and travel curbs 'likely options' Ms Sturgeon added that there would be financial support for people required to self-isolate, particularly those on low incomes. While larger fines for non-compliance were under consideration, she said a better approach was to ""remove barriers"" to self-isolation. She said: ""Nobody should be forced to choose between self-isolating for the collective good and paying their rent and feeding their families. ""If that is the choice people face, then it shouldn't be a surprise to us that compliance levels will be lower than we need them to be."" The first minister added that the ""collective action"" of the summer months had not been in vain, and without it the number of deaths would have been ""significantly higher"". ""We are in a much stronger position now than we would have been without that - but none of it was a magic wand that made the virus go away,"" she said. ""So as we face winter, as we face an acceleration of cases again, we must act to keep that under control."" The UK government's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance earlier warned that without further restrictionsthere could be 50,000 new coronavirus a day by mid-October.This could lead to about 200 deaths a day UK-wide by the middle of November. Scotland's interim chief medical officer, Gregor Smith, said cases in Scotland were roughly doubling every seven to nine days. Asked about suggestions that new restrictions might last for six months, Mr Sturgeon said this was ""the length of time we all likely to be living with some restrictions, but it is not necessarily going to be the same restrictions, of the same severity, for that period"". Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said people needed to heed the ""stark warnings"" about the virus.

'We've reached a perilous turning point' - PMBoris Johnson says new restrictions being introduced in England could prevent tougher rules later.UK,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""It would be tempting to think the threat had faded"" The UK has reached ""a perilous turning point"", Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said, as he set out a raft of new coronavirus restrictions for England which could last for up to six months. Shop staff will have to wear face masks and weddings will be limited to a maximum of 15 people, under the rules. Fines for breaking laws on gatherings and not wearing a mask will increase to Â£200 for a first offence. He also warned ""significantly greater restrictions"" could come if necessary. Mr Johnson said ""similar steps"" would be taken across the UK after he met with the leaders of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland on Tuesday morning. Like England, Scotland's First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, also announced a 22:00 curfew for hospitality businesses. The same measure is also set tocome into force in Waleson Thursday. But Ms Sturgeon went further than England on restrictions,banning the visiting of other households indoors. It comes as the number of UK cases rose by 4,926 on Tuesday,government figures showed,external, with deaths increasing by 37. New rules a balancing act of science and politics How have the rules changed? How many cases are there in your area? Where do I have to wear a face covering now? Weddings: 'We have to phone 15 people and un-invite them' Speaking in the House of Common, the prime minister told MPs: ""We always knew that while we might have driven the virus into retreat, the prospect of a second wave was real. I'm sorry to say that, as in Spain and France and many other countries, we've reached a perilous turning point."" Mr Johnson said the new rules were ""carefully judged"" to achieve the maximum reduction in the R number - which measures how quickly the virus is spreading - while causing ""the minimum damage to lives and livelihoods"". But he said this was ""by no means a return to the full lockdown of March"", with no general instructions to stay at home. Businesses, schools, colleges and universities will remain open. Attendance figures showthe number of schools in England sending home groups of pupils due to Covid-19 incidents quadrupled in a week. This video can not be played Covid restrictions: PM addresses the Commons, telling MPs of new hospitality and face covering rules In the last fortnight, hospital admissions have doubled and Covid-19 is likely to spread faster in winter, Mr Johnson said, adding: ""So this is the moment when we must act."" If these restrictions fail to bring the R number below one - the point where the epidemic is no longer growing - ""then we reserve the right to deploy greater fire power with significantly greater restrictions"" he said. Thelatest R estimate for the whole of the UK is between 1.1 and 1.4. Mr Johnson said: ""We will spare no effort in developing vaccines, treatments, new forms of mass-testing but unless we palpably make progress we should assume that the restrictions that I have announced will remain in place for perhaps six months."" Under the new measures for England: Office workers are being toldto work from home again if possible Penalties for not wearing a mask or gathering in groups of more than six will increase to Â£200 on the first offence From Thursday 24 September, all pubs, bars and restaurants will be restricted to table service only. Takeaways can continue Also from Thursday,hospitality venues must close at 22:00- which means shutting then, not calling for last orders (in Scotland the same curfew rule comes into force on Friday) Face coverings must be worn by taxi drivers and passengers from Wednesday Retail staff and customers in indoor hospitality venues will also have to wear masks from Thursday, except when seated at a table to eat or drink From Monday 28 September, only 15 people will be able to attend weddings and civil partnerships, in groups of six. Funerals can still take place with up to 30 people Also from 28 September, you can only play indoor adult sports in groups of less than six The planned return of spectators to sports venues will now not go ahead from 1 October Mr Johnson also said the government would provide police and local authorities in England with extra funding to enforce the regulations, with the option to draw on military support. Restating her support for people working from home, Scotland's first minister also announced her government might impose a ""legal duty"" on employers to allow home working. Ms Sturgeon said enforcement of coronavirus rules for the public in Scotland was ""under review"", but added: ""Supporting people to do the right thing is much more effective than threatening harsh punishment if they cannot."" The first minister also said the new restrictions on visiting other households would be reviewed every three weeks - and stressed that they would ""not necessarily"" be in place for as long as six months. The new restrictions in England amount to little more than a tinkering around the edges. Last week there was talk of mini lockdowns and circuit breaks. But with hospital admissions and deaths still low, there is a window of opportunity to see what impact these new measures will have. While the rapid growth put forward by the government's chief pandemic advisers on Monday that cases could reach 50,000 a day by mid-October is unlikely to be realised, according to many, the chances are infection rates will continue to climb. This is a virus which can be transmitted silently - people are infectious before symptoms develop, while some do not even develop any - and we are entering the time of year when respiratory illnesses circulate more and deaths start to increase. If and when this happens, the government will need to decide how far it is prepared to go. The same applies for the rest of the UK nations despite the tighter restrictions there on visiting people's homes. A full lockdown is highly unlikely, but more significant steps such as closing hospitality venues, leisure facilities and curbing everyday activities from playing sport to travelling around the country remain options. But the horrible question that will be asked is this: How much economic pain, disruption and damage to wider health and wellbeing is worth the lives that are at risk? The really tough calls are still to come. Read more from Nick. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he supported ""necessary"" stricter measures, but added that families were worried ""the government doesn't have a strategy"". ""One day people were encouraged to work in the office, in fact more than encouraged they were openly challenged by the prime minister for not doing so. Today they're told the opposite,"" he said. ""This is a time of national crisis but we need clear leadership."" This video can not be played Labour leader Keir Starmer accuses the government of not having a ""clear strategy"" for the pandemic Sir Keir also said it would be a ""disaster"" to withdraw the furlough scheme - which is due to end next month - in ""one fell swoop"" with no additional support for people whose jobs might be at risk. The governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey,suggested some sectors may benefit from further targeted help. SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? SUPPORT BUBBLES:What are they and who can be in yours? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? WEDDINGS:Can I have a reception with guests? SOCIAL LIFE:Is it safe to go to the pub? The Confederation of British Industry, which represents business, also called for a targeted replacement for the furlough scheme. ""It has saved thousands and thousands of jobs but there is a cliff-edge looming. And, now, with today's announcement that is more urgent than ever,"" said director general Dame Carolyn Fairbairn. Some business owners said the latest rules would make life even harder. Marc Gough, who runs a crockery and glassware business in the wedding and events sector, said the cut to the limit for weddings to 15 was ""heart breaking"". ""I can't earn a living because you're restricting me to weddings of 15 people,"" Mr Gough told BBC Radio 5 live, adding that the turnover of his business had fallen from Â£750,000 to Â£20,000. ""To walk into that warehouse, to put a smile on my face to the staff that I have left, to the clients that I deal with constantly, the brides, it's truly heart breaking,"" he said.

"Whitbread to cut 6,000 jobs as hotel demand slumps","Whitbread, which owns Premier Inn and Beefeater, has warned that 6,000 staff could lose their jobs. The company blamed the cuts on a slump in hotel guest numbers since lockdown. It comes as the government's furlough scheme, which still pays 27,000 Whitbread staff, ends next month. Meanwhile, pub chain JD Wetherspoon has warned its 1,000 staff who work at airport venues that almost half of them could lose their jobs because of the dramatic fall in travel and tourism. The company told staff that up to 450 people working at pubs in Gatwick, Heathrow, Stansted, Birmingham, Edinburgh and Glasgow airports could be made redundant.""The decision is mainly a result of a downturn in trade in these pubs, linked with the large reduction in passenger numbers using the airports,"" said Wetherspoon's chief executive John Hutson, who added that ""no firm decisions have been made"". The reduction in travellers and those sharing a meal out has also hurt Whitbread. It said hotel stays in August had halved and diner numbers fell by more than a third, though said it had been helped by the Eat Out to Help Out scheme. The company could also be affected by new rules forcing restaurants to shut at 22:00. From Thursday, hospitality venues willhave to closeearlier to help curb the spread of the coronavirus. Added to this, Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove has told people in England to now work from home ""if they can"" - a move that trade body UK Hospitality said was ""effectively a lockdown"" for city centre bars and restaurants. ""This is a huge, huge blow to hospitality and it will be potentially fatal for many businesses,"" it said. Whitbread said it expected demand to remain lower across the business well into 2021 and possibly even 2022. Whitbread boss Alison Brittain said the company was hoping to avoid compulsory redundancies. She said: ""With demand for travel remaining subdued, we are now having to make some very difficult decisions, and it is with great regret that today we are announcing our intention to enter into a consultation process that could result in up to 6,000 redundancies in the UK, of which it is hoped that a significant proportion can be achieved voluntarily."" Around three quarters of Whitbread's 35,000 staff are still paid in part through the government's furlough scheme. That scheme, called officially the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS) was introduced in March. It paid 80% of the wages of workers placed on leave, up to a maximum of Â£2,500 a month. Since July, furloughed workers have been able to return to work part-time with the government paying for any remaining hours not worked. A further change was brought in at the beginning of this month when employers were asked to pay 10% of the wages of those on furlough, plus their National Insurance and pension contributions. In October, the government will pay 60% of wages up to a cap of Â£1,875. The employers' share of the bill will then go up to 20% of wages. And the scheme will cease altogether at the end of next month, shortly before the Whitbread's 45-day consultation period will be completed for workers put on notice of redundancy. Whitbread also owns the Beefeater chain of restaurants The firm said it had taken the decision in the face of subdued demand, noting that it would stop receiving help with staff wages at the end of next month. Whitbread said it had lost more than three quarters of its sales in the first half the year when hotels and restaurants were forced to close because of the virus. Sales in hotels were 78% lower in the first half of the year, compared to 2019, while food and drink sales were down by 77%. ""The Premier Inn owner has had one of the toughest first halves out there,"" said Hargreaves Lansdown analyst Emilie Stevens. She said the proposed job losses were a sign that coronavirus had ""changed Whitbread's world for good"". ""Without full hotels the group isn't profitable, so a lower and more flexible cost base is essential,"" she said. Since reopening, Whitbread said demand for hotel rooms had been ""strong"" in tourist hotspots but London and other metropolitan areas had been less popular. But Ms Stevens said: ""Unfortunately this boost is likely to be short-lived and focus now turns to business travel."" ""We know city demand remains subdued and with more and more businesses announcing permanent work from home plans, we wonder if the return of business travellers is more 'if' than 'when'."" The expected job losses, which account for around a fifth of Whitbread's workforce, follow cuts to the company's head office staff, which affected around 150 people. Whitbread is not the first hospitality business that has been forced to lay off staff because to the pandemic. In June, The Restaurant Group - which owns Frankie and Benny's -announced plansto cut up to 3,000 workers, while Upper Crust-owner SSP has said thatup to 5,000could be let go andPizza Express warned1,100 people could lose their jobs. Last month, hotel group LGH - which manages 55 properties, including some Crowne Plaza, Holiday Inn and Hallmark hotels - said that around1,500 staffwere at risk of redundancy. By late morning trading, shares in Whitbread had lost around 2% of their value. Have you been affected by the issues raised in this story?

Breaking|Breaking newsBan on meeting in houses extended across ScotlandFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon says people from different households will no longer be able to meet in homes.ScotlandComments,"This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon announces extension of ban on meeting in houses A ban on visiting other people's homes is to be imposed across Scotland, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has announced. The measure is already in place for more than 1.75 million people in Glasgow and some neighbouring areas. But Ms Sturgeon said it would be rolled out across the whole of Scotland from Wednesday in a bid to get the virus under control again before winter. She also confirmed that Scotland would be following England in imposing a 10pm curfew on pubs and restaurants. The curfew will be in place from Friday - with Ms Sturgeon warning that any premises that do not comply could be shut down completely. Indoor and outdoor gatherings in Scotland were restricted to six people from two households just two weeks ago. Live reaction to Ms Sturgeon's statement What are the latest rules in Scotland? 'We've reached a perilous turning point' - PM However, the number of people testing positive for the virus has continued to increase since then - with the average number of new cases every day now reaching 285, compared to only seven a day in July. The 383 new cases confirmed on Tuesday was the highest daily total since 15 April, and the sixth highest since the outbreak began in Scotland. The first minister said hospital and intensive care admissions were also starting to rise, with more older people testing positive. She said the country therefore had to go further to prevent the virus spreading unchecked, and that the scientific advice was that household interaction was a ""key driver"" of transmission. Ms Sturgeon said the Scottish government had therefore decided ""after careful consideration"" that visiting other people's homes will no longer be permitted. The move means Scotland will have tougher coronavirus restrictions than England - where people can can still meet in groups of up to six in a house. She said: ""One of the reasons we have decided to do this is that our early data suggests this restriction is starting to slow the increase of cases in the west of Scotland. ""So if we extend it nationwide now, in an early and preventative way, we hope it will help to bring the R number down and the virus back under control."" Regulations enforcing the changes will come into place from Friday, but Ms Sturgeon said everyone should comply from Wednesday. The first minister said the new restrictions on visiting other households would be reviewed every three weeks - and stressed that they will ""not necessarily"" be in place for as long as six months, as some reports have suggested. There will be exceptions for those living alone, or alone with children, who form extended households. The rules will also not apply to couples who do not live together, or to tradespeople or for the provision of informal childcare - such as by grandparents. Meetings in public indoor settings - such as pubs and restaurants - will continue to be limited to a maximum of six people from two households. And up to six people from two different households can continue to meet outdoors, including in private gardens. Ms Sturgeon urged people not to book foreign trips during the October holiday However, children under the age of 12will be exemptfrom both the limit of six and the limit of two households if they are meeting outside. And young people aged between 12 to 18 will be exempt from the two household limit - so will be able to meet outdoors in groups of up to six. Ms Sturgeon acknowledged: ""The measures I am announcing today are tough - I will not pretend otherwise - but they do not represent a full-scale lockdown of the kind imposed in March. ""Indeed, today's measures are an attempt to avoid another lockdown. ""By acting early and substantially, our hope is that these new measures will be in place for a shorter period than would be the case if we waited longer to act."" The first minister said she was keeping the option of a so-called circuit breaker -  a short period of nationwide lockdown, potentially during the October holiday - under review. She urged peoplenot to book overseas travelfor the October break ""unless it is absolutely essential"", and advised against car sharing with people outside your own household. Ms Sturgeon made her statement to the Scottish Parliament shortly after Prime Minister Boris Johnsonoutlined new measures in Englandin the House of Commons. The two leaders and their counterparts in Wales and Northern Ireland have held talks over a UK-wide approach over the past 24 hours. Both the UK and Scottish leaders made television broadcasts to the nation on Tuesday evening. Prime Minister Boris Johnson called on the public to ""summon the discipline and the resolve"" to follow the new rules, warning the government may go further if people do not stick to them. Mr Johnson said while the vast majority have complied with the measures so far, ""there have been too many breaches"". Immediately afterwards,Nicola Sturgeon said the latest restrictions may feel like a ""step backwards"", but urged Scots to stick with them anyway, insisting they ""will make a difference"". She said: ""Please know that thanks to all your efforts over the last six months, we are in a much stronger position than in the spring."" The day's announcements came after theUK's Covid-19 alert level moved to 4, meaning the virus is ""high or rising exponentially"". The licensed trade has warned that forcing them to close at 10pm could lead to further job losses Stephen Montgomery of the Scottish Hospitality Group, which represents more than 50 pubs and restaurants, accused Ms Sturgeon of ""singling out"" the industry despite ""very little evidence"" that it is linked to the spread of the virus. He said: ""With 90,000 Scottish jobs at risk we are heading towards a cliff edge and time is running out. ""We have been speaking with government and that will be ongoing but there is only a matter of months before the restrictions on our industry will have irreparable long-term damage on our sector."" The Scottish Tourism Alliance said the curfew on pubs and restaurants was ""likely to be the last straw for many businesses which were only just managing to break even"". The Scottish Chambers of Commerce warned that ""stricter measures in Scotland are undeniably more dangerous for the survival of businesses"" and called for more support to be given by both the Scottish and UK governments. The Conservatives said the Scottish government had only hired 874 contact tracers so far, despitesaying in May,externalthat 2,000 contact tracing staff would be required to ""deliver a sustainable service across Scotland"". Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said it was clear that Scotland's test and trace system was ""not working"" and that ""too often the system is overwhelmed"". The new Scottish restrictions are more extensive than those announced by Boris Johnson for England. Nicola Sturgeon has matched the prime minister by introducing a 10pm curfew for bars and restaurants. Table service and some of the other new requirements for England already apply in Scotland. In her Holyrood statement, the first minister said she was aligning with other UK nations ""as far as possible"". She also said her scientific team had advised that the UK government's package ""on its own will not be sufficient"" to bring coronavirus under control. The Scottish government's gone significantly further by extending the West of Scotland ban on visiting others in their own homes nationwide. Nicola Sturgeon said the new rules would be reviewed every three weeks and need not all last for six months - which was the timescale Boris Johnson suggested for his measures. All governments intend to back up their policies with enforcement but there has been no mention of big new fines in Scotland. This is devolved decision making in action in the biggest crisis since the creation of the Scottish Parliament. Some argue divergence across the UK is confusing and undesirable but opinion polls consistently suggest the Scottish public trust Holyrood to set the pace.

Is the gold in your phone funding drug gangs?Gold from a refiner used by criminals to launder drug money has entered supply chains for smartphones and cars.,"Kaloti is a major participant in global gold refining with a substantial presence in Dubai A gold refiner that was used by criminals to launder drug money has been allowed to sell gold into global supply chains used to make smartphones and cars. International investigators concluded that the Dubai-based trader Kaloti was buying gold from criminal networks. The US Treasury was urged by law enforcement six years ago to warn the world that it was a ""primary money laundering concern"". But the warning was never given. As a result, Kaloti has continued to sell tonnes of gold to companies in the supply chains of Apple, General Motors and Amazon, which use the precious metal in components. This has put firms and millions of consumers at risk of unwittingly funding criminal activity. The US Treasury did not respond to requests for comment. Kaloti's representatives said it ""vehemently denied"" it was knowingly involved in any crime or misconduct. Confidential documents seen by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) and the BBC reveal the US Treasury was urged by investigators in 2014 to issue the warning after a three-year investigation. Codenamed ""Honey Badger"" and led by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), the investigation concluded that Kaloti was involved in a scheme to transport or transfer ""tremendous amounts of illicit value through the use of gold as a commodity"". Under the scheme described in the documents, criminals anywhere in the world could use drug money or other unlawfully obtained cash to buy scrap gold such as second-hand jewellery and bring it to Kaloti. In exchange for the gold, according to investigators,Kaloti would offer bulk cash or send a wire transfer to them. This video can not be played How a drug gang laundered money In 2014, the DEA recommended that the US Treasury should publicly designate Kaloti a ""primary money laundering concern"" under the US Patriot Act, which would have made it too risky for global banks to do business with them, freezing the group out of the global financial system. But the US Treasury never took action against Kaloti. Former officials said it put off a decision on the recommendation, concerned about the reaction of the United Arab Emirates, a key diplomatic ally, where Kaloti was based. When the UAE failed to act on its own initiative, the investigation was shelved. Kaloti did not have the chance to see or challenge any of the evidence as they were not questioned by investigators and there could be undisclosed reasons justifying why the report wasn't acted upon. Attempts to obtain an explanation from the US Treasury failed to draw a response. The investigation, which the US government has never made public, was supported by a flood of reports of suspicious activity from banks across the world handling Kaloti's money. Lenders including Deutsche Bank and Barclays submitted 34 separate reports about Kaloti to the US Treasury's Financial Crime Enforcement Network (FinCEN), highlighting as suspicious thousands of transactions from 2007 to 2015 totalling $9.3bn (Â£7.26bn). In 2017 a money laundering gang was convicted in France of laundering the proceeds of drug sales all over Europe including the UK. Last October,BBC Panorama revealedthat a company controlled by the gang, Renade International, had sold $146m (Â£114m) of gold to Kaloti in 2012 alone - part of $5.2bn of gold purchases paid for with cash. Kaloti is based in Dubai Kaloti vehemently denies ever acting improperly and says it has never been accused or contacted by any US authority about wrongdoing. It says it performs full due diligence on all customers and suppliers. Lawyers for the firm said it had successfully passed audits each year against all regulatory and legal standards. The DEA-led taskforce investigating Kaloti submitted a report of their investigation and recommended the primary money laundering designation in August 2014. But after the designation didn't materialise, gold sold by Kaloti has continued  to end up in major supply chains. Apple's list of approved suppliers includes entities which have purchased tonnes of gold from Kaloti, including Valcambi, one of the largest gold refiners in the world, based in Switzerland. All modern smartphones feature components made with gold, which is a highly conductive metal. This year the anti-corruption watchdog Global Witness reported that in 2018 and 2019, Valcambi purchased up to 20 tonnes of gold directly from Kaloti and a further 60 tonnes from a related entity. A further report by the Tech Transparency Project listed two further Swiss refiners which had purchased gold from Kaloti and were also on Apple's list of suppliers. Valcambi said it would not confirm or deny buying gold from Kaloti. The company said it only purchases gold from its suppliers ""where the company can fully ensure the identification of the origin of the gold"". In a statement, Apple said it was committed to responsibly sourcing for its products: ""If a refiner is unable or unwilling to meet our standards, they will be removed from our supply chain. Since 2015, we've stopped working with 63 refiners of gold for this reason. ""Several thorough and independent reviews have been conducted since 2015, and there is no evidence that any gold from Kaloti enters Apple products."" Black market gold can be used to launder profits from the drug trade Kaloti is listed as being in the supply chain for General Motors and Amazon, according to data submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission, the US regulator. General Motors, which uses gold in car parts such as catalytic converters, said it was committed to responsible sourcing of goods used in its manufacturing and had not done business with Kaloti directly. It said none of its suppliers had shared any compliance issues or concerns regarding Kaloti.

"Whitbread to cut 6,000 jobs as hotel demand slumpsThe owner of Premier Inns has warned that almost 20% of its workers could be laid off.","Whitbread, which owns Premier Inn and Beefeater, has warned that 6,000 staff could lose their jobs. The company blamed the cuts on a slump in hotel guest numbers since lockdown. It comes as the government's furlough scheme, which still pays 27,000 Whitbread staff, ends next month. Meanwhile, pub chain JD Wetherspoon has warned its 1,000 staff who work at airport venues that almost half of them could lose their jobs because of the dramatic fall in travel and tourism. The company told staff that up to 450 people working at pubs in Gatwick, Heathrow, Stansted, Birmingham, Edinburgh and Glasgow airports could be made redundant.""The decision is mainly a result of a downturn in trade in these pubs, linked with the large reduction in passenger numbers using the airports,"" said Wetherspoon's chief executive John Hutson, who added that ""no firm decisions have been made"". The reduction in travellers and those sharing a meal out has also hurt Whitbread. It said hotel stays in August had halved and diner numbers fell by more than a third, though said it had been helped by the Eat Out to Help Out scheme. The company could also be affected by new rules forcing restaurants to shut at 22:00. From Thursday, hospitality venues willhave to closeearlier to help curb the spread of the coronavirus. Added to this, Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove has told people in England to now work from home ""if they can"" - a move that trade body UK Hospitality said was ""effectively a lockdown"" for city centre bars and restaurants. ""This is a huge, huge blow to hospitality and it will be potentially fatal for many businesses,"" it said. Whitbread said it expected demand to remain lower across the business well into 2021 and possibly even 2022. Whitbread boss Alison Brittain said the company was hoping to avoid compulsory redundancies. She said: ""With demand for travel remaining subdued, we are now having to make some very difficult decisions, and it is with great regret that today we are announcing our intention to enter into a consultation process that could result in up to 6,000 redundancies in the UK, of which it is hoped that a significant proportion can be achieved voluntarily."" Around three quarters of Whitbread's 35,000 staff are still paid in part through the government's furlough scheme. That scheme, called officially the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS) was introduced in March. It paid 80% of the wages of workers placed on leave, up to a maximum of Â£2,500 a month. Since July, furloughed workers have been able to return to work part-time with the government paying for any remaining hours not worked. A further change was brought in at the beginning of this month when employers were asked to pay 10% of the wages of those on furlough, plus their National Insurance and pension contributions. In October, the government will pay 60% of wages up to a cap of Â£1,875. The employers' share of the bill will then go up to 20% of wages. And the scheme will cease altogether at the end of next month, shortly before the Whitbread's 45-day consultation period will be completed for workers put on notice of redundancy. Whitbread also owns the Beefeater chain of restaurants The firm said it had taken the decision in the face of subdued demand, noting that it would stop receiving help with staff wages at the end of next month. Whitbread said it had lost more than three quarters of its sales in the first half the year when hotels and restaurants were forced to close because of the virus. Sales in hotels were 78% lower in the first half of the year, compared to 2019, while food and drink sales were down by 77%. ""The Premier Inn owner has had one of the toughest first halves out there,"" said Hargreaves Lansdown analyst Emilie Stevens. She said the proposed job losses were a sign that coronavirus had ""changed Whitbread's world for good"". ""Without full hotels the group isn't profitable, so a lower and more flexible cost base is essential,"" she said. Since reopening, Whitbread said demand for hotel rooms had been ""strong"" in tourist hotspots but London and other metropolitan areas had been less popular. But Ms Stevens said: ""Unfortunately this boost is likely to be short-lived and focus now turns to business travel."" ""We know city demand remains subdued and with more and more businesses announcing permanent work from home plans, we wonder if the return of business travellers is more 'if' than 'when'."" The expected job losses, which account for around a fifth of Whitbread's workforce, follow cuts to the company's head office staff, which affected around 150 people. Whitbread is not the first hospitality business that has been forced to lay off staff because to the pandemic. In June, The Restaurant Group - which owns Frankie and Benny's -announced plansto cut up to 3,000 workers, while Upper Crust-owner SSP has said thatup to 5,000could be let go andPizza Express warned1,100 people could lose their jobs. Last month, hotel group LGH - which manages 55 properties, including some Crowne Plaza, Holiday Inn and Hallmark hotels - said that around1,500 staffwere at risk of redundancy. By late morning trading, shares in Whitbread had lost around 2% of their value. Have you been affected by the issues raised in this story?

How does Scotland's new contact tracing app work?,"Scotland now has its ownproximity tracing appto help combat the spread of Covid-19. People with smartphones are being urged todownload Protect Scotland,externalas soon as possible to help boost the Test and Protect system. The app uses Bluetooth technology to alert users if they have been in prolonged close contact with someone who has since tested positive for Covid-19. When an individual tests positive for the virus they are contacted by a contact tracer via text, phone or email. The contact tracer will ask them if they are an app user and if they are willing to use the app's upload function to anonymously alert close contacts. If they agree, they'll be sent a unique code to their mobile which unlocks this function on the app. By sharing their positive test result in this way it forms part of an anonymous database. The app on other users' phones regularly checks this database to see if they have been in contact with an infected person. A warning is automatically issued when a match is found. Users are then urged to self-isolate for 14 days. Protect Scotland can be downloaded for free from Apple's App Store or Google Play. On iPhones, the app will only work on the iOS 13 operating system, which can run on any models from the iPhone 6s onwards. Android users need to be running Android 6.0 or later. Essentially, any phones released after 2015 should have the ability to run the app. Yes. The app uses anonymous codes or ""keys"". These will be exchanged between phones via Bluetooth but they contain no personal data. They may include some information about Bluetooth signal strength, which the app uses to estimate proximity, but they cannot be used to identify you. Using the app is entirely voluntary and you don't have to enter any personal details to download or install it. The decentralised approach is designed to maximise privacy. If you're using the app, your phone collects lots of anonymised keys from nearby users but it stores these locally on your device, rather than uploading them. Your phone will check them against the database to see if any of these keys were ""infected"" but it won't upload any information without your permission. The app includes a leave function which can be used at any time to delete all app data from the phone. Up until now contact tracing has been done manually using a method used for years to help control the spread of infectious diseases. A person who is infected is interviewed over the phone to identify close contacts - people they have been within two metres of for a period of 15 minutes or more. These close contacts are then phoned and given advice. This will continue to be the main method of contact tracing, but the app is designed to reinforce the system. The app uses the same standard for a ""close contact"" - two metres for 15 minutes - as the Test and Protect teams. Some users are advised to turn their phones off, or disable Bluetooth, in some circumstances. For example, these would include health or social care workers in clinical settings who are wearing medical grade PPE. This is to stop these users being told to self-isolate when they were not at risk. The developers say there is always a chance that false positives can be generated - such as through the wall of a house or flat - but the risk is ""very low"". Health experts also argue that false positives also occur in manual test and trace with people being told to self-isolate when they are not infected. The Scottish government has pointed to anOxford University study,external, which claims that even with an uptake of just 15%, a contact tracing app can drive down infections by about 8% and deaths by about 6% - if it is part of a manual track and trace strategy. In Scotland, 15% of the adult population equates to about 689,000 people. The app was downloaded in Scotland by more than 360,000 people in the first 24 hours. Another contact tracing app being developed by the NHS in England ran into technical problems and is currently being tested following a revamp. The app being adopted in Scotland is instead based on a system developed in Ireland by the software firm NearForm. Contact tracing app 'working' in Ireland NearForm designed it using a toolkit made available to developers by Apple and Google Not all the features on the app being used in Ireland will be available on the Scottish app. The Irish version of the app includes a ""Check-in"" function so users can report Covid symptoms For instance, Ireland's Covid Tracker includes an optional ""Check-in"" function which allows users to share with the health service if they are showing Covid symptoms. NearForm's system has also been adopted in Northern Ireland. In Scotland the app will focus solely on contact tracing and initially will not work outside the country. The Scottish government said it anticipated Protect Scotland would work with equivalent apps in the Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland and Gibraltar by the end of September. Health authorities in Scotland will also continue to liaise with the UK and Welsh governments to ensure data sharing arrangements are considered when apps are available in England and Wales. The app being developed by NHS England didn't initially use the Apple/Google toolkit, butthat decision was reversed in June.

'We've reached a perilous turning point' - PMBoris Johnson says new restrictions being introduced in England could prevent tougher rules later.,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""It would be tempting to think the threat had faded"" The UK has reached ""a perilous turning point"", Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said, as he set out a raft of new coronavirus restrictions for England which could last for up to six months. Shop staff will have to wear face masks and weddings will be limited to a maximum of 15 people, under the rules. Fines for breaking laws on gatherings and not wearing a mask will increase to Â£200 for a first offence. He also warned ""significantly greater restrictions"" could come if necessary. Mr Johnson said ""similar steps"" would be taken across the UK after he met with the leaders of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland on Tuesday morning. Like England, Scotland's First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, also announced a 22:00 curfew for hospitality businesses. The same measure is also set tocome into force in Waleson Thursday. But Ms Sturgeon went further than England on restrictions,banning the visiting of other households indoors. It comes as the number of UK cases rose by 4,926 on Tuesday,government figures showed,external, with deaths increasing by 37. New rules a balancing act of science and politics How have the rules changed? How many cases are there in your area? Where do I have to wear a face covering now? Weddings: 'We have to phone 15 people and un-invite them' Speaking in the House of Common, the prime minister told MPs: ""We always knew that while we might have driven the virus into retreat, the prospect of a second wave was real. I'm sorry to say that, as in Spain and France and many other countries, we've reached a perilous turning point."" Mr Johnson said the new rules were ""carefully judged"" to achieve the maximum reduction in the R number - which measures how quickly the virus is spreading - while causing ""the minimum damage to lives and livelihoods"". But he said this was ""by no means a return to the full lockdown of March"", with no general instructions to stay at home. Businesses, schools, colleges and universities will remain open. Attendance figures showthe number of schools in England sending home groups of pupils due to Covid-19 incidents quadrupled in a week. This video can not be played Covid restrictions: PM addresses the Commons, telling MPs of new hospitality and face covering rules In the last fortnight, hospital admissions have doubled and Covid-19 is likely to spread faster in winter, Mr Johnson said, adding: ""So this is the moment when we must act."" If these restrictions fail to bring the R number below one - the point where the epidemic is no longer growing - ""then we reserve the right to deploy greater fire power with significantly greater restrictions"" he said. Thelatest R estimate for the whole of the UK is between 1.1 and 1.4. Mr Johnson said: ""We will spare no effort in developing vaccines, treatments, new forms of mass-testing but unless we palpably make progress we should assume that the restrictions that I have announced will remain in place for perhaps six months."" Under the new measures for England: Office workers are being toldto work from home again if possible Penalties for not wearing a mask or gathering in groups of more than six will increase to Â£200 on the first offence From Thursday 24 September, all pubs, bars and restaurants will be restricted to table service only. Takeaways can continue Also from Thursday,hospitality venues must close at 22:00- which means shutting then, not calling for last orders (in Scotland the same curfew rule comes into force on Friday) Face coverings must be worn by taxi drivers and passengers from Wednesday Retail staff and customers in indoor hospitality venues will also have to wear masks from Thursday, except when seated at a table to eat or drink From Monday 28 September, only 15 people will be able to attend weddings and civil partnerships, in groups of six. Funerals can still take place with up to 30 people Also from 28 September, you can only play indoor adult sports in groups of less than six The planned return of spectators to sports venues will now not go ahead from 1 October Mr Johnson also said the government would provide police and local authorities in England with extra funding to enforce the regulations, with the option to draw on military support. Restating her support for people working from home, Scotland's first minister also announced her government might impose a ""legal duty"" on employers to allow home working. Ms Sturgeon said enforcement of coronavirus rules for the public in Scotland was ""under review"", but added: ""Supporting people to do the right thing is much more effective than threatening harsh punishment if they cannot."" The first minister also said the new restrictions on visiting other households would be reviewed every three weeks - and stressed that they would ""not necessarily"" be in place for as long as six months. The new restrictions in England amount to little more than a tinkering around the edges. Last week there was talk of mini lockdowns and circuit breaks. But with hospital admissions and deaths still low, there is a window of opportunity to see what impact these new measures will have. While the rapid growth put forward by the government's chief pandemic advisers on Monday that cases could reach 50,000 a day by mid-October is unlikely to be realised, according to many, the chances are infection rates will continue to climb. This is a virus which can be transmitted silently - people are infectious before symptoms develop, while some do not even develop any - and we are entering the time of year when respiratory illnesses circulate more and deaths start to increase. If and when this happens, the government will need to decide how far it is prepared to go. The same applies for the rest of the UK nations despite the tighter restrictions there on visiting people's homes. A full lockdown is highly unlikely, but more significant steps such as closing hospitality venues, leisure facilities and curbing everyday activities from playing sport to travelling around the country remain options. But the horrible question that will be asked is this: How much economic pain, disruption and damage to wider health and wellbeing is worth the lives that are at risk? The really tough calls are still to come. Read more from Nick. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he supported ""necessary"" stricter measures, but added that families were worried ""the government doesn't have a strategy"". ""One day people were encouraged to work in the office, in fact more than encouraged they were openly challenged by the prime minister for not doing so. Today they're told the opposite,"" he said. ""This is a time of national crisis but we need clear leadership."" This video can not be played Labour leader Keir Starmer accuses the government of not having a ""clear strategy"" for the pandemic Sir Keir also said it would be a ""disaster"" to withdraw the furlough scheme - which is due to end next month - in ""one fell swoop"" with no additional support for people whose jobs might be at risk. The governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey,suggested some sectors may benefit from further targeted help. SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? SUPPORT BUBBLES:What are they and who can be in yours? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? WEDDINGS:Can I have a reception with guests? SOCIAL LIFE:Is it safe to go to the pub? The Confederation of British Industry, which represents business, also called for a targeted replacement for the furlough scheme. ""It has saved thousands and thousands of jobs but there is a cliff-edge looming. And, now, with today's announcement that is more urgent than ever,"" said director general Dame Carolyn Fairbairn. Some business owners said the latest rules would make life even harder. Marc Gough, who runs a crockery and glassware business in the wedding and events sector, said the cut to the limit for weddings to 15 was ""heart breaking"". ""I can't earn a living because you're restricting me to weddings of 15 people,"" Mr Gough told BBC Radio 5 live, adding that the turnover of his business had fallen from Â£750,000 to Â£20,000. ""To walk into that warehouse, to put a smile on my face to the staff that I have left, to the clients that I deal with constantly, the brides, it's truly heart breaking,"" he said.

Prime Minister confirms fan return is off,"Brighton hosted Chelsea in a friendly in August that saw 2,500 fans attend with social distancing in place Fans may not to be able to return to watch live sporting events in England until the end of March at the earliest. At a meeting on Tuesday, sports governing bodies - including those from football, rugby, cricket, Formula 1 and horse racing - were told to prepare for no spectators throughout the winter. Officials from the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) told the meeting, which was attended by Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden, that the ban on fans will be kept under review. Premiership Rugby chief executive Darren Childs said: ""The announcement that supporters will not be allowed into stadiums for up to six months cuts off crucial revenue for clubs who have already suffered significant financial losses from suspending the season and playing matches behind closed doors since March. ""We believe the lack of supporters in our grounds could cause irreparable damage to our clubs and the communities they serve, so we must find a way forward to avoid this."" Ralph Rimmer, the chief executive of the Rugby Football League (RFL), added: ""Today's call specifically focused on the postponement of the pilot event programme and the plans for socially distanced crowds and the further serious impact this will now have on sports. ""The secretary of state indicated that the postponement may last throughout the winter. The impact on rugby league and other sports is profound."" Earlier on Tuesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson outlined a range of new restrictions for the country, including confirmation that plans to allow fans to return to sport from 1 October would not go ahead. The plans had beenplaced under reviewearlier this month after a rise in coronavirus cases. The UK's Covid-19 alert level has moved to 4, meaning transmission is ""high or rising exponentially"". The prime minister also said restrictions are likely to remain in place for the next six months. ""We have to acknowledge the spread of the virus is now affecting our ability to reopen large sporting events,"" said the prime minister. 'Delayed return of fans is devastating for clubs, their employees and local businesses' Premier League clubs consider alternatives after proposed return of fans scrapped In an address to the Commons on Tuesday, Johnson announced new restrictions for the country and those included the halting of the phased return of fans. ""We will not be able to do this from 1 October and I recognise the implications for our sports clubs, which are the life and soul of our communities,"" he added. ""The chancellor and the culture secretary are working urgently on what we can do now to support them."" The pilot programme, which was to trial events of up to 1,000 spectators, has also been paused. Two Premiership rugby union matches - Bath v Gloucester on Tuesday and Bristol v Leicester next week - will now be played behind closed doors, as will a horse racing meeting at Newmarket later this week. The majority of sports in England have been played behind closed doors since the coronavirus lockdown in March, including Premier League football fixtures and the FA Cup final, England's Test cricket matches and two Formula 1 races at Silverstone. This video can not be played How long can football clubs survive without the return of fans in the stadium? Sport events that took place with full crowds in March shortly before all fixtures were postponed and the UK locked down have come under scrutiny. The impact of Liverpool's Champions League fixture against Atletico Madrid on the spread of coronavirus is beinginvestigated by the city's council,while there have also been calls for an investigation into whether horse racing's Cheltenham Festivalshould have gone ahead. The government defended its decision to allow such events to proceed before restrictions on mass gatherings were introduced. ""People look back now at the beginning of the pandemic at some of the major sporting events then and ask the question why were they allowed to go ahead,"" said Cabinet Secretary Michael Gove on BBC Breakfast earlier on Tuesday. ""What we must do is look at sporting events now with caution but we also recognise that sport is a vital part of this nation and we're looking at everything we can do to support our athletes, our great clubs, through what will be a challenging time."" Julian Knight, the chair of the DCMS select committee, said: ""If we don't find a route map with smart solutions to allow sports and live events to gradually reopen, we risk decimation of our sporting and cultural infrastructure."" The leaders of more than 100 sports bodies have written to the prime minister to ask for emergency funding,warning of ""a lost generation of activity""because of coronavirus. Sport England has handed out Â£200m for emergency cases, but many in the sector believe more is needed. Earlier this month, Premier League chief executive Richard Masters told BBC Sportit was ""absolutely critical""fans were allowed back inside stadiums as soon as possible and failure to do so would cost clubs Â£700m during the 2020-21 season. English Football League (EFL) clubs lost Â£50m in gate receipts last season andestimate a Â£200m lossif there are no fans this season. The Rugby Football Union (RFU) said no spectators at the forthcoming Autumn Nations Cup or Six Nations will result in losses of Â£60m. RFL chief executive Rimmerurged the government not to delay the return of crowds,with clubs facing a potential impact on revenues of ""up to Â£2m per week"". At the end of August, 2,500 people watched a friendly between Brighton and Chelsea at the Seagulls' Amex Stadium - the first time fans had been allowed into a Premier League ground for almost six months. About 300 spectatorswere allowed to watchlast month's World Snooker Championship final between Ronnie O'Sullivan and Kyren Wilson at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield, but original plans to admit fans for all days of the tournament were reversed. Arsenal's 9-1 victory over West Ham in the Women's Super League on 12 September saw up to 1,000 fans attend. More than 2,500 spectators bought tickets for the first day of the St Leger meeting at Doncaster on 9 September, the first crowd at a British horse racing fixture in six months - but the rest of the meeting wasthen held behind closed doors. Also on Tuesday, it was confirmed that indoor recreational team sports such as netball, basketball and five-a-side football will not be able to continue under the new restrictions, which limit numbers taking part to six. Larger fitness classes will be permitted, as long as they are organised so those taking part do not mix in groups of more than six. Elite indoor sports are exempt, as are indoor sports played by children. This is grim news for British sport, which teeters on the brink of an unprecedented crisis. On one hand, it is no surprise, given rising cases of Covid-19, tighter restrictions and the criticism the government received for allowing events like the Cheltenham Festival to continue in March and not shutting down sooner. The optics of allowing thousands of fans to travel to grounds while encouraging people to work from home was also seen as insurmountable. But it will infuriate sports governing bodies that insist it is much safer for fans to be in highly regulated, socially distanced, often open-air venues and stadiums than watching on the TV in pubs, for instance. They are not aware of any data or research which proves the return of fans would increase transmission. And they point to the fact that countries like Germany are allowing thousands of fans back inside grounds. Sports are now being warned to brace themselves for several months without fans and report back to DCMS officials what impact this will have on their finances. For the EFL and rugby clubs in particular, where matchday revenue is crucial, the answer will be potentially devastating. From non-league football and Olympic sports, through to grassroots clubs and community leisure facilities, the sector fears an existential crisis which could cost thousands of jobs and result in a slump in participation. Pressure will now build on the government to come up with a similar emergency fund to the Â£1.57bn bailout the arts sector was handed in the summer.

Is the gold in your phone funding drug gangs?,"Kaloti is a major participant in global gold refining with a substantial presence in Dubai A gold refiner that was used by criminals to launder drug money has been allowed to sell gold into global supply chains used to make smartphones and cars. International investigators concluded that the Dubai-based trader Kaloti was buying gold from criminal networks. The US Treasury was urged by law enforcement six years ago to warn the world that it was a ""primary money laundering concern"". But the warning was never given. As a result, Kaloti has continued to sell tonnes of gold to companies in the supply chains of Apple, General Motors and Amazon, which use the precious metal in components. This has put firms and millions of consumers at risk of unwittingly funding criminal activity. The US Treasury did not respond to requests for comment. Kaloti's representatives said it ""vehemently denied"" it was knowingly involved in any crime or misconduct. Confidential documents seen by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) and the BBC reveal the US Treasury was urged by investigators in 2014 to issue the warning after a three-year investigation. Codenamed ""Honey Badger"" and led by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), the investigation concluded that Kaloti was involved in a scheme to transport or transfer ""tremendous amounts of illicit value through the use of gold as a commodity"". Under the scheme described in the documents, criminals anywhere in the world could use drug money or other unlawfully obtained cash to buy scrap gold such as second-hand jewellery and bring it to Kaloti. In exchange for the gold, according to investigators,Kaloti would offer bulk cash or send a wire transfer to them. This video can not be played How a drug gang laundered money In 2014, the DEA recommended that the US Treasury should publicly designate Kaloti a ""primary money laundering concern"" under the US Patriot Act, which would have made it too risky for global banks to do business with them, freezing the group out of the global financial system. But the US Treasury never took action against Kaloti. Former officials said it put off a decision on the recommendation, concerned about the reaction of the United Arab Emirates, a key diplomatic ally, where Kaloti was based. When the UAE failed to act on its own initiative, the investigation was shelved. Kaloti did not have the chance to see or challenge any of the evidence as they were not questioned by investigators and there could be undisclosed reasons justifying why the report wasn't acted upon. Attempts to obtain an explanation from the US Treasury failed to draw a response. The investigation, which the US government has never made public, was supported by a flood of reports of suspicious activity from banks across the world handling Kaloti's money. Lenders including Deutsche Bank and Barclays submitted 34 separate reports about Kaloti to the US Treasury's Financial Crime Enforcement Network (FinCEN), highlighting as suspicious thousands of transactions from 2007 to 2015 totalling $9.3bn (Â£7.26bn). In 2017 a money laundering gang was convicted in France of laundering the proceeds of drug sales all over Europe including the UK. Last October,BBC Panorama revealedthat a company controlled by the gang, Renade International, had sold $146m (Â£114m) of gold to Kaloti in 2012 alone - part of $5.2bn of gold purchases paid for with cash. Kaloti is based in Dubai Kaloti vehemently denies ever acting improperly and says it has never been accused or contacted by any US authority about wrongdoing. It says it performs full due diligence on all customers and suppliers. Lawyers for the firm said it had successfully passed audits each year against all regulatory and legal standards. The DEA-led taskforce investigating Kaloti submitted a report of their investigation and recommended the primary money laundering designation in August 2014. But after the designation didn't materialise, gold sold by Kaloti has continued  to end up in major supply chains. Apple's list of approved suppliers includes entities which have purchased tonnes of gold from Kaloti, including Valcambi, one of the largest gold refiners in the world, based in Switzerland. All modern smartphones feature components made with gold, which is a highly conductive metal. This year the anti-corruption watchdog Global Witness reported that in 2018 and 2019, Valcambi purchased up to 20 tonnes of gold directly from Kaloti and a further 60 tonnes from a related entity. A further report by the Tech Transparency Project listed two further Swiss refiners which had purchased gold from Kaloti and were also on Apple's list of suppliers. Valcambi said it would not confirm or deny buying gold from Kaloti. The company said it only purchases gold from its suppliers ""where the company can fully ensure the identification of the origin of the gold"". In a statement, Apple said it was committed to responsibly sourcing for its products: ""If a refiner is unable or unwilling to meet our standards, they will be removed from our supply chain. Since 2015, we've stopped working with 63 refiners of gold for this reason. ""Several thorough and independent reviews have been conducted since 2015, and there is no evidence that any gold from Kaloti enters Apple products."" Black market gold can be used to launder profits from the drug trade Kaloti is listed as being in the supply chain for General Motors and Amazon, according to data submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission, the US regulator. General Motors, which uses gold in car parts such as catalytic converters, said it was committed to responsible sourcing of goods used in its manufacturing and had not done business with Kaloti directly. It said none of its suppliers had shared any compliance issues or concerns regarding Kaloti. Amazon said it was ""committed to ensuring that the products and services we provide are produced in a way that respects human rights and the environment. We engage with suppliers that are committed to these same principles. ""We expect suppliers to support our effort to identify the origin of designated minerals used in our products."" Investigators who had worked for years to expose money laundering linked to Kaloti describe themselves as ""incredibly frustrated"" by the US Treasury's handling of the matter. ""We put a tremendous amount of work and effort over three years into the case - we all lived and breathed it,"" said one of the people on the DEA-led taskforce, speaking anonymously. ""We were very confident we had more than enough for them to be designated. It pissed us all off.""

"Get serious about winning, Starmer tells LabourThe Labour leader also attacks Boris Johnson's ""serial incompetence"" in his first conference speech.UK PoliticsComments","This video can not be played Sir Keir: ""We still have a lot of work to do"" Sir Keir Starmer has told Labour to ""get serious about winning"" in his first conference speech as leader. Sir Keir attacked Boris Johnson's ""serial incompetence"" and said he was ""just not up to the job"" of being PM. But he said Labour had work to do win back voters' trust - and had deserved to lose the 2019 general election. In an online broadcast, he set out his vision for the UK and urged voters to ""take another look at Labour"", adding: ""We are under new leadership."" And he assured voters who deserted the party in droves in some of its traditional heartlands: ""We love this country as you do."" Starmer speech reaction Starmer faces challenges over patriotism call Labour aims to build trust with new slogan A guide to party conferences in a Covid world The speech was delivered to a near-empty room, in Doncaster, South Yorkshire, because of social distancing restrictions, and was greeted with silence instead of the usual applause and ovations. He criticised the government's handling of the coronavirus pandemic and said the crisis had revealed Boris Johnson as being ""just not serious"" and ""not up to the job"". ""It makes me angry that, just when the country needs leadership, we get serial incompetence,"" said the Labour leader. But he said Labour had to be ""brutally honest"" with itself about why had it had lost four general elections in a row. ""When you lose an election in a democracy you deserve to. You don't look at the electorate and ask them: 'what were you thinking?',"" he told the party. He said Labour was ""becoming a competent, credible Opposition but that's not enough"". And he vowed that ""never again will Labour go into an election not being trusted on national security, with your job, with your community and with your money. That's what being under new leadership means."" Keir Starmer literally stood in front of a red wall in Doncaster, and his key message was to those who had abandoned Labour in 2019 - we hear you. He has something of an innovative policy chief in Claire Ainsley - one who doesn't believe in setting out detailed policies. So he was blatant - clever policy offers aren't enough to win trust. Far more important are values. He emphasised the classic Labour values of ""compassion"" and ""opportunity"", but also stressed the importance of family and security - seen as a weak spot for Labour under Jeremy Corbyn. His message to his own party was more brutal than anticipated - suggesting that it would be a ""betrayal"" to be anything other than relentless in seeking power. But he was also brutal towards the prime minister - Starmer was a serious lawyer when Boris Johnson was writing flippant columns. So far, Starmer's focus as Labour leader has been on competence. Polling suggests this has been successful  - but he has been accused of being managerial, even funereal, in his approach. Today he succeeded in injecting passion into a speech in a near empty hall. His ""new leadership"" is ambitious for change, but he was also ""angry"" that he wasn't in power to achieve it. Labour's four-day online event replaced the party's traditional party conference due to be held in Liverpool, which was cancelled due to the Covid-19 pandemic. In his speech, Sir Keir said the policies on which Labour will fight the next election in 2024 ""won't sound like anything you've heard before"". ""It will sound like the future arriving,"" he said of the party's next manifesto. On Brexit, Sir Keir, who campaigned for a second referendum, declared that Labour would not be a party ""that keeps banging on about Europe"". ""Let me absolutely clear,"" he said, ""the debate between Leave and Remain is over."" He called on the prime minister to secure a trade deal with the EU, and said he would be ""failing Britain"" if he failed to achieve one. He also pledged to fight for the Union, saying: ""We must make the case much more persuasively that we achieve more together than we do alone. ""To stop the Nationalists ripping our country apart by design, and to stop the Tories dismantling it by neglect."" Sir Keir replaced Jeremy Corbyn as leader in the contest that followed December's general election, where the party won fewer Commons seats than any election since 1935. The broadcast Sir Keir's first Labour conference speech since becoming leader in April. On the economy, the Labour leader repeated calls for ""properly funded"" public services and ""huge investment"" in skills to create work opportunities. He also called for action to tackle climate change, and for the government to develop a new strategy to close gaps in education inequality. And he pledged to work ""hand-in-hand"" with both the private sector and trade unions in a bid to create ""high quality jobs"". Momentum, the left wing campaign group originally set up to support Jeremy Corbyn's leadership, said Sir Keir's speech was a ""missed opportunity to show substance"". The group's co-chair, and West Midlands regional secretary of the Fire Brigades Union, Andrew Scattergood, said: ""If Starmer wants to appeal to working class voters, his pitch should be based on solidarity with the working class and defending their interests, not just slogans and platitudes."" He accused the Labour leader of being silent on key issues, including Black Lives Matter and the end of the evictions ban in England - and suggested he was ""rowing back"" on promises made during his leadership campaign, such as taxing the ""super rich"". But Nathan Yeowell, director of Progress, which was originally set up to campaign for Blairite values, tweeted: ""It is so refreshing to have a Labour leader who wants to win."" In a message to supporters after the Labour leader's speech, the Conservative Party said: ""Sir Keir Starmer was a key member of Jeremy Corbyn's top team.

Sturgeon to announce new Scots Covid restrictions,"This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon announces extension of ban on meeting in houses A ban on visiting other people's homes is to be imposed across Scotland, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has announced. The measure is already in place for more than 1.75 million people in Glasgow and some neighbouring areas. But Ms Sturgeon said it would be rolled out across the whole of Scotland from Wednesday in a bid to get the virus under control again before winter. She also confirmed that Scotland would be following England in imposing a 10pm curfew on pubs and restaurants. The curfew will be in place from Friday - with Ms Sturgeon warning that any premises that do not comply could be shut down completely. Indoor and outdoor gatherings in Scotland were restricted to six people from two households just two weeks ago. Live reaction to Ms Sturgeon's statement What are the latest rules in Scotland? 'We've reached a perilous turning point' - PM However, the number of people testing positive for the virus has continued to increase since then - with the average number of new cases every day now reaching 285, compared to only seven a day in July. The 383 new cases confirmed on Tuesday was the highest daily total since 15 April, and the sixth highest since the outbreak began in Scotland. The first minister said hospital and intensive care admissions were also starting to rise, with more older people testing positive. She said the country therefore had to go further to prevent the virus spreading unchecked, and that the scientific advice was that household interaction was a ""key driver"" of transmission. Ms Sturgeon said the Scottish government had therefore decided ""after careful consideration"" that visiting other people's homes will no longer be permitted. The move means Scotland will have tougher coronavirus restrictions than England - where people can can still meet in groups of up to six in a house. She said: ""One of the reasons we have decided to do this is that our early data suggests this restriction is starting to slow the increase of cases in the west of Scotland. ""So if we extend it nationwide now, in an early and preventative way, we hope it will help to bring the R number down and the virus back under control."" Regulations enforcing the changes will come into place from Friday, but Ms Sturgeon said everyone should comply from Wednesday. The first minister said the new restrictions on visiting other households would be reviewed every three weeks - and stressed that they will ""not necessarily"" be in place for as long as six months, as some reports have suggested. There will be exceptions for those living alone, or alone with children, who form extended households. The rules will also not apply to couples who do not live together, or to tradespeople or for the provision of informal childcare - such as by grandparents. Meetings in public indoor settings - such as pubs and restaurants - will continue to be limited to a maximum of six people from two households. And up to six people from two different households can continue to meet outdoors, including in private gardens. Ms Sturgeon urged people not to book foreign trips during the October holiday However, children under the age of 12will be exemptfrom both the limit of six and the limit of two households if they are meeting outside. And young people aged between 12 to 18 will be exempt from the two household limit - so will be able to meet outdoors in groups of up to six. Ms Sturgeon acknowledged: ""The measures I am announcing today are tough - I will not pretend otherwise - but they do not represent a full-scale lockdown of the kind imposed in March. ""Indeed, today's measures are an attempt to avoid another lockdown. ""By acting early and substantially, our hope is that these new measures will be in place for a shorter period than would be the case if we waited longer to act."" The first minister said she was keeping the option of a so-called circuit breaker -  a short period of nationwide lockdown, potentially during the October holiday - under review. She urged peoplenot to book overseas travelfor the October break ""unless it is absolutely essential"", and advised against car sharing with people outside your own household. Ms Sturgeon made her statement to the Scottish Parliament shortly after Prime Minister Boris Johnsonoutlined new measures in Englandin the House of Commons. The two leaders and their counterparts in Wales and Northern Ireland have held talks over a UK-wide approach over the past 24 hours. Both the UK and Scottish leaders made television broadcasts to the nation on Tuesday evening. Prime Minister Boris Johnson called on the public to ""summon the discipline and the resolve"" to follow the new rules, warning the government may go further if people do not stick to them. Mr Johnson said while the vast majority have complied with the measures so far, ""there have been too many breaches"". Immediately afterwards,Nicola Sturgeon said the latest restrictions may feel like a ""step backwards"", but urged Scots to stick with them anyway, insisting they ""will make a difference"". She said: ""Please know that thanks to all your efforts over the last six months, we are in a much stronger position than in the spring."" The day's announcements came after theUK's Covid-19 alert level moved to 4, meaning the virus is ""high or rising exponentially"". The licensed trade has warned that forcing them to close at 10pm could lead to further job losses Stephen Montgomery of the Scottish Hospitality Group, which represents more than 50 pubs and restaurants, accused Ms Sturgeon of ""singling out"" the industry despite ""very little evidence"" that it is linked to the spread of the virus. He said: ""With 90,000 Scottish jobs at risk we are heading towards a cliff edge and time is running out. ""We have been speaking with government and that will be ongoing but there is only a matter of months before the restrictions on our industry will have irreparable long-term damage on our sector."" The Scottish Tourism Alliance said the curfew on pubs and restaurants was ""likely to be the last straw for many businesses which were only just managing to break even"". The Scottish Chambers of Commerce warned that ""stricter measures in Scotland are undeniably more dangerous for the survival of businesses"" and called for more support to be given by both the Scottish and UK governments. The Conservatives said the Scottish government had only hired 874 contact tracers so far, despitesaying in May,externalthat 2,000 contact tracing staff would be required to ""deliver a sustainable service across Scotland"". Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said it was clear that Scotland's test and trace system was ""not working"" and that ""too often the system is overwhelmed"". The new Scottish restrictions are more extensive than those announced by Boris Johnson for England. Nicola Sturgeon has matched the prime minister by introducing a 10pm curfew for bars and restaurants. Table service and some of the other new requirements for England already apply in Scotland. In her Holyrood statement, the first minister said she was aligning with other UK nations ""as far as possible"". She also said her scientific team had advised that the UK government's package ""on its own will not be sufficient"" to bring coronavirus under control. The Scottish government's gone significantly further by extending the West of Scotland ban on visiting others in their own homes nationwide. Nicola Sturgeon said the new rules would be reviewed every three weeks and need not all last for six months - which was the timescale Boris Johnson suggested for his measures. All governments intend to back up their policies with enforcement but there has been no mention of big new fines in Scotland. This is devolved decision making in action in the biggest crisis since the creation of the Scottish Parliament. Some argue divergence across the UK is confusing and undesirable but opinion polls consistently suggest the Scottish public trust Holyrood to set the pace.

What are the rules on weddings?,"There will be no limit on the number of people allowed to attend weddings, civil partnerships and receptions in England from 19 July. Rules will also ease in Scotland on that date. From 19 July,there will be no limits on the number of people who can attend services or receptions,external, whatever the venue. Current rules about social distancing and face coverings will no longer apply, there will be no requirement for table service, and restrictions around singing and dancing will also end. At the moment, any number of guests can attend a wedding ceremony or reception held outside, or in a Covid-secure public venue. Venues must comply with social distancing rules, which limit guest numbers Venues must provide table service Dancing and singing are restricted Face coverings must be worn indoors by everyone over the age of 11 when not eating or drinking, unless they are exempt. This includes staff, but not the couple or the person officiating Weddings held in outdoors private settings - such as gardens - require a risk assessment to determine how many guests can be hosted safely. A marquee or other structure in a private garden must have at least half of its walled area open to be classed as ""outdoors"". Weddings in private homes can only take place with six people or two households present, unless one of those getting married is seriously ill, in which case 30 people can attend. How could life change on 19 July? Official guidance for wedding and civil partnerships,external Official guidance for places of worship,external The maximum limit of who can attend wedding and civil partnership ceremonies and receptions depends on the Covid level. Level two restriction area,external- up to 50 Level one,external- up to 100 Level zero,external- up to 200 First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has saidthe whole country will move to level 0 on 19 July, meaningup to 200 guests can attend a wedding,external. The actual permitted number of guests for a particular event will still depend on the size of the venue. The marrying couple and witnesses are included in this number, but people working at the wedding are not. There will be no need to socially distance outdoors: dancing, standing drinks/canapÃ© receptions and receiving lines can resume at weddings outdoors only You should avoid dancing or mingling indoors at wedding receptions Physical distancing will be fixed at 1m (3ft) indoors for ceremonies and receptions in all venues Alcohol can be served until 24:00 Guests will still have to wear masks when not seated The government hopes that more restrictions will be scrapped on 9 August, subject to a decision next month. The number of people who can attendwedding or civil partnership ceremonies or receptions,externalis determined by the size of the venue and a Covid risks assessment. The celebration must be organised by a business in a regulated venue, such as an hotel. Face coverings must be worn indoors by everyone aged 11 and over when not eating or drinking, unless they have a reasonable excuse. This does not apply to the married couple or the person officiating. Food and drink are permitted in line withhospitality guidance,external. There isno limit on the number of people at a wedding,external, but venues must assess how many they can safely accommodate. During the ceremony, face coverings must be worn by everyone (unless exempt), apart from the wedding couple and the person officiating. Receptions can take place, subject to the following rules: No restriction on the number of people at the top table, but no more than 10 people (not including children) at other tables You need to wear a mask when not seated The wedding couple can have one dance together, but guests cannot dance Live music is allowed at ""ambient levels"" Some rules aredue to change on 26 July, subject to approval on 22 July. Volume restrictions on live music will be removed and social distancing rules will be relaxed. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA)published guidance in September 2020,external: If your wedding couldn't go ahead without breaching lockdown rules, you're likely to be entitled to a refund and won't be liable for future payments Your refund may also cover a ''non-refundable'' deposit, although a venue or supplier can subtract ''limited'' costs for services already provided A venue may withhold money spent on your wedding that it could not recover, such as planning, but not for things like general staff costs Suppliers/venues must give you a cost breakdown if they wish to withhold part of your deposit Wedding insurance shouldn't affect your right to a refund, but you can't get your money back twice. Most insurance doesn't cover a ''government act"", so is unlikely to pay out if lockdowns affected your wedding. Recent wedding insurance policies are unlikely to cover coronavirus.

What is self-isolation and who has to do it?,"The latest Covid booster campaign is under way across the UK and those who qualify are urged to get jabbed as soon as possible. No Covid restrictions are in place across the UK, but guidance recommends people who catch the virus ""should try to stay at home"". Many of the symptomsare similar to those for colds and flu,externaland include: high temperature, fever or chills continuous cough loss of, or change in, your normal sense of taste or smell shortness of breath feeling tired or exhausted aching body headache sore throat blocked or runny nose loss of appetite diarrhoea feeling sick or being sick Most people feel better within a few days or weeks - but for some, it can be more serious. Those concerned their or their child's symptoms are worsening should request an urgent GP appointment or help fromNHS 111,external. WHO charts rapid spread of new JN.1 Covid variant Why Covid is still flooring some people Between 2% and 20% of people catching Covidgo on to have longer-term symptoms, ""long Covid"", research suggests. In March, the Office for National Statistics (ONS)estimated 1.9 million people in the UK (2.9% of the population),externalstill had symptoms more than four weeks after their initial infection. There is no simple test for long Covid, andpeople report a variety of symptoms,external, including: extreme tiredness shortness of breath muscle aches memory and concentration problems (""brain fog"") Some people have developed long Covid after an initial mild infection. What are the symptoms of long Covid? Get NHS help with Covid recovery,external Routine Covid testing is not recommended, and most people can't get free tests via the NHS. You may stillbe able to get free NHS tests,externalif you: have a health condition that makes you eligible for treatment if you test positive work in healthcare or a hospice You can buy a test for about Â£2 from High Street and online chemists, but cannot report these test results to the NHS. People are largely advised to treat Covid like any other respiratory disease. You no longer have to self-isolate after testing positive. However, the government recommends trying to stay home for five days - or three for under-18s, as younger people tend to be infectious for a shorter period. People at higher risk of becoming seriously ill with Covid who have been told they areentitled to treatments if they catch it,externalmust report their test result so the NHS can contact them about their options. How to look after yourself if you get Covid Some people are infectious for about five days but others may be contagious for up to 10. Those who have a high temperature or still feel unwell after five days are advised to stay home if they can until they: feel well enough for your normal activities no longer have a high temperature You don't have to tell your employer you have Covid. However, you are asked to avoid contact with others for five days, which means you should work from home if you can, especially if you have a high temperature. The specific schemes offering financial support to those isolating during the pandemic have ended. But you may be entitled toStatutory Sick Pay,external- worth Â£109.40 a week. Under-18s who test positive for Covid are advised to stay at home for three days. NHS guidance saysif a child has mild symptoms such as a runny nose, sore throat or mild cough,external- and they feel well enough - they can go to school or childcare. In the UK, you canonly have the Covid vaccine via the NHS,externalif you meet certain criteria. For most people, vaccinations are now available only as part of a seasonal rollout.  You cannot currently buy them privately. The 2023 autumn booster campaign is targeting: residents in care homes for older adults over-65s people aged six months to 64 years in a clinical risk group front-line health and social-care workers 12-64-year-olds who are household contacts of people with weakened immune systems 16-64-year-olds who are carers or work in care homes for older adults pregnant women The NHS has been contacting eligible people. You canno longer book a Covid jab online or by calling NHS 119,external- but you may be able to with a local NHS vaccination serviceor you can find a walk-in site,external. This round of seasonal Covid jabs will be available until 31 January. Moderna told BBC News ithoped its Covid jab would be on sale in the UK from 2024. Pfizer is also exploring options for private provision. Who can get another Covid jab this autumn? If you have Covid, or think you might,NHS advice is to delay vaccination until you feel better,external. It also recommends waiting if you have a high temperature or feel otherwise unwell with any illness. But there is no need to wait if you have recently recovered from Covid and feel well. The vaccines do not infect people with Covid and cannot cause positive test results.

The people living with post-viral fatigue,"Thousands of coronavirus patients, including many who were not ill enough to be hospitalised, have been suffering for months from fatigue and a range of other symptoms. While professionals struggle to support them, what can they learn from those living with chronic illnesses? If you've been following the stories of people who have contracted coronavirus and are experiencing debilitating symptoms that won't go away, Jade Gray-Christie's story may sound familiar. Because her symptoms were considered ""mild"", she was not hospitalised, but her life has been turned upside down since falling ill in March. Before the pandemic, Jade had been living an extremely busy life. The 32-year-old from Stoke Newington in London was balancing a fulfilling job supporting young people from disadvantaged backgrounds, with an active social life, and going to the gym three times a week. But in the early hours of the morning on 15 March, Jade came home from a long day at work, and knew something wasn't right. ""I felt horrendous. I was starting to feel really hot and cold and I just kept coughing and coughing and coughing,"" Jade told me, speaking softly, through laboured breaths. As the days went by, Jade, who is asthmatic and lives alone, started to feel more and more unwell and scared. She called 111. They sent an ambulance to her ground-floor flat, but the paramedics refused to come in. ""They spoke to me through the window and asked what was going on,"" she says. Lying in bed and struggling to get the words out, Jade explained that she was finding it hard to breathe and had severe pains in her chest. She was told that she had the classic ""Covid cough"", but because of her age, they couldn't take her to the hospital. She was young, they said, and her body was strong enough to recover. Jade was taken aback. ""What do I do about my breathing? I'm asthmatic. I live by myself so if something happens I've got nobody to support me. What do I do?"" But she was told that they weren't taking anyone under the age of 70 in case she made someone else in the hospital ill. ""So I was kind of just left,"" Jade says. ""I understood what they were saying, but at the same time I was really poorly and I didn't know what would happen. I was quite scared to go to sleep at night."" Jade started leaving her front door unlocked, asking her neighbours to check on her daily to make sure that nothing happened to her as she slept. As time went by, she did seem to slowly improve. But every time she thought she was making a recovery, her symptoms returned. In May, Jade felt well enough to start working part-time from home. She was still experiencing chest pains and some tiredness, but as someone who was used to a busy life, she felt she could manage. Then, at the end of the month, something changed. ""My chest got really bad again. I was struggling to breathe and I wasn't able to get out of my bed,"" she says. ""My fatigue was like nothing I've ever experienced before."" Jade has been given two more inhalers for Covid symptoms as well as the one she needs for asthma Months passed with little improvement. Sometimes she slept more than 16 hours per day, and struggled with the day-to-day activities needed to look after herself. When I checked in on Jade at the end of July, she told me that her doctor said she had post-viral fatigue - but she hadn't been given any advice on how to manage her symptoms beyond being told to ""pace"" and have a routine for sleeping and waking. Pacing is a skill that involves breaking challenging elements of your life into smaller, more manageable ones. The idea is to learn coping strategies to help improve quality of life and stabilise your health. But Jade struggled to understand how to apply the idea of pacing to her life. Keeping to a routine felt almost impossible, as she often woke up exhausted and just fell back to sleep again. ""When I did speak with the doctor regarding my dizziness, the fact I have fainted, and also about my fatigue, he openly stated that he did not know how to support me and that the virus is still so new. This of course left me feeling even worse."" ""If the doctors cannot help, then who else can?"" she asked. The World Health Organization (WHO) acknowledges that it does not yet fully understand Covid-19. It says that typical recovery times are two weeks for patients with mild illness, and up to eight weeks for those with severe illness, but it recognises that there are people like Jade who continue to have symptoms for longer. In such cases, the WHO says, symptoms may include extreme fatigue, persistent cough or exercise intolerance. The virus can cause inflammation in the lungs, cardiovascular and neurological systems, and it can take a long time for the body to recover. 'Long Covid' patients need treatment programme, doctors say Why are people remaining ill for so long? Jade's experience has been echoed by tens of thousands of people across the country, and is now known as ""Long Covid"". According to the Covid Symptom Study app, which tracks people's symptoms regardless of whether they had a test, about 300,000 people in the UK have reported symptoms lasting for more than a month, and 60,000 people have been ill for more than three months. Barbara Melville is an admin of the Long Covid Support Group on Facebook, which was set up to provide a place for people to talk about their experiences and support each other. It now has over 21,000 members, who are living with a wide range of symptoms. Interestingly, a lot of people in the group, like Jade, originally had a mild case of coronavirus, though one doctor described Barbara's as ""moderately severe"". Many of them say they are not able to access the care and support they need, and she describes ""two emerging narratives"" when it comes to trying to find help. Some struggle to be taken seriously at all, with people being told, especially early on, that their symptoms are caused by anxiety, she says. Others have sympathetic GPs who will arrange blood tests and chest X-rays or CT scans for lung issues - but once those examinations have been carried out, they are not sure what specialist services to refer them to, or how to help them. ""I think most GPs are at an absolute loss, they don't know what to do for people,"" Barbara says. ""It's about policy. Doctors don't have the guidelines yet to know what to do, so everybody is shooting in the dark."" During the early months of the pandemic, when there was even less help or recognition for people experiencing Long Covid symptoms, many patients and patient advocacy groups started doing their own research. ""You don't know if you're going to live or die, and Covid puts you on a merry-go-round of symptoms - one minute it's pain in kidneys, then stomach. For a lot of people, although not for me, there's also lung issues and shortness of breath,"" says Lorraine Pickering, a former teacher at a busy secondary school in Wiltshire, who developed symptoms in March and has since been diagnosed with Covid. Looking for answers, she turned to the chronic illness community and realised that many of their symptoms overlapped. She found a huge amount of useful advice and support about how to cope with a long-term health condition - learning that with the right adjustments it was still possible to have a fulfilling life. ""If you've never been ill before, it takes a lot of emotional and physical resilience,"" she says. She also noticed that early on in the pandemic, people living with chronic illness were already speculating about the potential long-term repercussions of coronavirus, and were concerned for this new influx of patients. There was a palpable fear that some people wouldn't make a full recovery, and also that this would strain a system where many already struggle to get the care and support that they need. ""The chronic illness community is used to waiting 12 months to see a specialist or spending three hours in a clinic waiting for a 10-minute test, but this may well come as an unpleasant shock to previously healthy folks,"" says Jo Southall, an occupational therapist who specialises in supporting people with chronic illness. ""There were a whole lot of people on waiting lists for rehabilitative care before Covid-19 hit and the backlog has only got worse."" Lauren Walker, an adviser to the Royal College of Occupational Therapists, adds that access to specialists has always been a ""postcode lottery"" and that it is a particular problem for disadvantaged groups. ""It is a really inequitable system,"" she says. Listen to Jade Gray-Christie and Jo Southall on the Ouch! podcast:It is possible to be tired and in pain and happy at the same time Download moreOuch! Cabin Fever podcasts here In an attempt to help the growing number of people with long Covid symptoms, in July the NHS launched an online portal calledYourCovidRecovery,external. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said it would ""give people who have survived the virus on-demand access to online clinical support"" for problems with breathing, mental health or other complications. However, Barbara says the response from her support group has been mixed, with some pointing out that it simply duplicates advice about pacing and breathing exercises that is already available elsewhere online. ""Sufferers are looking for comprehensive support, such as time with specialist consultants. They don't need more of the same,"" she says. But, in many cases, these are the same specialists that there are already long waiting lists to see. Jo Southall has a more positive view of the portal. ""Good quality generic advice is essential in the 'waiting' stages,"" she says. She believes that the most important thing at the moment is to prevent people from getting worse, and one danger she sees is that people could be encouraged to exercise too hard - which could make them more unwell. In July, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellencecautioned against using graded exercise therapy,externalfor patients recovering from Coronavirus. (It also noted that its advice for managing chronic fatigue could be out of date for other groups of patients too. This advice is currently under review.) ""Sometimes no progress is progress,"" Jo says. ""It's all too easy for health to spiral downwards with symptoms like fatigue, so when you're going it alone, a plateau should be seen as a win."" When dealing with fatigue, occupational therapists use something called the three P's: planning, pacing and prioritising This involves identifying strategies to make things easier and manage energy more effectively For example, if showering is exhausting, try it at a different time of day, or sit down instead of standing Break activities up into smaller tasks and spread them throughout the day Plan 30-40 minutes of rest breaks between activities Lauren Walker,Royal College of Occupational Therapists,external So, where does this leave patients? For many, it's still a waiting game. As for Jade, her health is still up and down, but she is now getting physiotherapy and occupational therapy through the Covid clinic at University College Hospital in London. Her employers have been very supportive, which has made a huge difference. When she had an occupational assessment, she was told that they had seen many similar cases. ""That was a huge relief, just to be believed,"" she says, having spent many months feeling as though she had to prove that what was happening to her was not ""all in her head"". She finally received a letter confirming her Covid diagnosis this week. Jade is now planning to work from home for the rest of the year, with reduced hours and responsibilities, and has been advised to break up her day, working in two-hour stints with mini-breaks in between. She's glad to be able to get back to work and engage her brain. Not all employers are as sympathetic, warns Barbara, with many stories being shared in her support group of people forced back to work too soon. ""They're scared that they're not going to be able to feed their families,"" she told me. ""Rest and pacing are a privilege."" Others have told her they're facing discrimination at work because they are unable to provide evidence that they had the illness - even though testing wasn't made widely available for months - and are not being given the adjustments they need to work safely. She is, however, hopeful that this crisis will lead to a culture change in the way people living with long-term health conditions are treated. ""What I'd like to see in five years' time is that someone with Long Covid symptoms, or any illness, can go to the doctor, get the support they need, for the doctor to feel supported, and that people feel able to talk about this with their employers and peers. ""Covid has really highlighted inequalities and there's an opportunity here to start doing something."" In one of our calls, Jade told me that after becoming ill she really felt like her life was over. It was only once she started getting support, care and understanding that things started to change for her. She now feels like she may be able to find a way to cope with her new normal.

""Sometimes no progress is progress,"" Jo says. ""It's all too easy for health to spiral downwards with symptoms like fatigue, so when you're going it alone, a plateau should be seen as a win."" When dealing with fatigue, occupational therapists use something called the three P's: planning, pacing and prioritising This involves identifying strategies to make things easier and manage energy more effectively For example, if showering is exhausting, try it at a different time of day, or sit down instead of standing Break activities up into smaller tasks and spread them throughout the day Plan 30-40 minutes of rest breaks between activities Lauren Walker,Royal College of Occupational Therapists,external So, where does this leave patients? For many, it's still a waiting game. As for Jade, her health is still up and down, but she is now getting physiotherapy and occupational therapy through the Covid clinic at University College Hospital in London. Her employers have been very supportive, which has made a huge difference. When she had an occupational assessment, she was told that they had seen many similar cases. ""That was a huge relief, just to be believed,"" she says, having spent many months feeling as though she had to prove that what was happening to her was not ""all in her head"". She finally received a letter confirming her Covid diagnosis this week. Jade is now planning to work from home for the rest of the year, with reduced hours and responsibilities, and has been advised to break up her day, working in two-hour stints with mini-breaks in between. She's glad to be able to get back to work and engage her brain. Not all employers are as sympathetic, warns Barbara, with many stories being shared in her support group of people forced back to work too soon. ""They're scared that they're not going to be able to feed their families,"" she told me. ""Rest and pacing are a privilege."" Others have told her they're facing discrimination at work because they are unable to provide evidence that they had the illness - even though testing wasn't made widely available for months - and are not being given the adjustments they need to work safely. She is, however, hopeful that this crisis will lead to a culture change in the way people living with long-term health conditions are treated. ""What I'd like to see in five years' time is that someone with Long Covid symptoms, or any illness, can go to the doctor, get the support they need, for the doctor to feel supported, and that people feel able to talk about this with their employers and peers. ""Covid has really highlighted inequalities and there's an opportunity here to start doing something."" In one of our calls, Jade told me that after becoming ill she really felt like her life was over. It was only once she started getting support, care and understanding that things started to change for her. She now feels like she may be able to find a way to cope with her new normal.

'Banker ladies' saving friends from debt,"Hilda Robles at her home in San Antonio Minority communities in the US and elsewhere have sometimes turned to traditional money saving methods outside the formal banking system. The economic shock from the coronavirus pandemic could spur renewed interest in those savings clubs. When Hilda Robles recalls her first years in America, tears come to her eyes. ""I cried and even wanted to leave at one point because I felt alone,"" she says. ""I would ask people for help and they couldn't help me because they didn't understand Spanish and I didn't understand English."" When she came to San Antonio, Texas some 20 years ago, even daily duties like getting to work or going to the doctor were feats of bilingual diplomacy and logistical planning - she had no car, no English and almost no one to turn to for help. Opening a bank account seemed impossible. ""When I stepped into a bank for the first time, I was told I couldn't open a bank account because I had no social security number,"" she says. ""Someone told me about a bank where I could open an account with no social security number, but the language barrier stopped me from going."" Hilda Robles moved to San Antonio about two decades ago So Ms Robles, 49, went a different route - she started a tanda, an informal savings club popular in Latin America, with contributions from her extended relatives. Members of the club each contribute a fixed sum to a pool of money on a regular, periodic schedule, with the lump sum going to one member each round until everyone gets paid. This means that members get back what they put in over the course of the scheme, but by getting it in the form of a lump sum, the money can be put to use for purchases, investments or debt payments they otherwise could not afford. Members who get their ""hand"" early are effectively receiving an interest-free loan, while those who receive theirs later in the cycle are essentially withdrawing a lump of ""saved"" cash. With the $5,000 lump sum she received for her turn of her tanda, Ms Robles bought her first car. Her relatives and friends in the savings club were able to put down payments on houses, pay for university tuition - and now, amid the Covid-19 pandemic, survive when their families have been out of work or sick. Since that first savings club 14 years ago, Ms Robles has run them continuously with only a few months break to organise the next one. ""It gives me a lot of joy to see people reach their goals because of the tandas without having to drown in debt from loans,"" she says. ""It's proof that among us Hispanics, we can get ahead here."" Hispanic-Americans are not alone in their use of this ancient savings mechanism that has parallels all over the globe, known generally as a rotating savings and credit association, or roscas. 'I'm just looking for whatever I can get' Where $1,200 payments are going - food, bidets, guns In Mexico, they are popularly called tandas, but they are also known as huis, susus or ballot committees in various parts of the world. Immigrant communities continue their practice in the US. As economic hardship accompanies the public health crisis caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, for some families, traditional methods of saving outside the banking system have become a lifeline, especially for hard-hit immigrant communities with little access to mainstream sources of capital. Financial access and security in America has become an increasingly pressing subject of discussion in 2020. Even before the pandemic, the US was behind other rich countries when it comes to accessing money and credit. Some seven percent of Americans over the age of 15 did not have any kind of bank accounts in the US in 2017, compared to less than one percent of Canadians, and less than four percent of Britons, according to the World Bank. A quarter of American adults - more than 80 million people - were ""unbanked"" or ""underbanked"", meaning either that they had no accounts entirely, or that they are forced to use alternative services besides traditional banks in order to get enough financial access to meet goals or obligations. Tandas allow members to save money in order to receive an eventual lump sum Households most likely to fall into the two categories were black or Hispanic, lack university qualifications and to be poor. To access loans, they must sometimes turn to non-bank lending options like payday lenders or loan sharks. These shadow banking options can be risky, charge high interests and bring dire consequences for borrowers who struggle to pay - but a rosca can provide a safer, more trustworthy alternative. ""These systems are actually useful when we have bank systems that have a finite possibility,"" says Caroline Hossein, a professor of business and social studies at York University who studies roscas in communities in Canada. ""Banks only have a certain amount of money, and if you only have a certain amount of money, you're only going to dish it out to those that are less risky. Coronavirus: 'We're still waiting at home for them to come back' Coronavirus: 'We used to donate to this food bank, now we rely on it' ""So it makes perfect sense that people would engage in these kinds of mutual aid or money pooling systems."" Often, they are run by women, whom Dr Hossein calls the ""banker ladies"" of the community. ""The banker lady, who might be the one organising it - you can be in touch with her anytime of day, it may be someone who lives in your neighbourhood so [there's] the ease of getting there. ""The paperwork is not as treacherous as it would be as a formal bank, so there's a kind of kinship that exists because it's people who voluntarily like and know each other."" Though they tend to be ""more of a life line for people who have difficulty accessing banking, particularly on the lending side,"" such savings schemes are also used by more established members of communities who may have inherited knowledge about them from immigrant parents. Beyond access to a pool of money, ""a primary benefit is building 'bonds of mutual trust' within a network of trustworthy people,"" says Lee Martin of the University of California, Davis. Roscas are primarily beneficial for people without access to mainstream forms of credit, he says. But because they are used by marginalised communities, studying their overall prevalence and use has been difficult, says Dr Hossein, who participates in a rosca - known as a su-su in her Afro-Carribean community - as part of her research. ""A lot of these roscas, particularly in places like Canada, the US or Europe, tend to be underground,"" she says, because many worry that the endeavour is seen as an unrespectable or even an illicit form of financing, only for those who are short of options. Clearly, unlike a savings account, they do not generate interest. Yet economists believe they are probably quite common in the West. One survey of Korean-American garment business owners in Los Angeles from 2004 found that 77% of households had participated in a version of the lending scheme. Self-lending within communities can have unexpected benefits. A rosca-like system among Chinese immigrants in Spain, for example, helped expatriate businessmen weather the Euro crisis of the late 2000s and 2010s. The Chinese business community was ""largely insulated from the vagaries of the country's tottering retail banking system"" - precisely because the system that shut them out meant they turned to each other, reported the Financial Times in 2014. Ms Robles writing out her tanda rota In the 2020 Covid-19 crisis, families who participated in the tanda Ms Robles is running were able to pay their bills when some fell ill and could not work. For most, it was their only source of cash, Ms Robles says - only one of the families has received a cheque from the government for coronavirus relief because they lack the papers to get onto the dole. Like any investment scheme, however, roscas are not risk-free. A participant could fail to pay their hand, or take their share and run. Ms Robles says there have been rare times that she misplaced a contribution and had to make up the difference out of her own pocket, which can be costly. As they operate on trust, usually within a deeply connected community, the social consequences of misdeeds dissuades wrong-doing. But since they are run by privately, there is little legal recourse for cheating. And unlike putting money in a bank savings account, there is no interest paid. Could roscas catch on and become more mainstream? The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphiaasked just such a question in 2006,external, but was sceptical given the depth of trust it would require. An attempt by Yahoo Finance to popularise a tanda app in 2018 was unsuccessful. The scheme shut down after only a few months due to, it would seem, lack of participation. There are two big hurdles, as Dr Hossein sees it - the stigma attached to a non-traditional financial tool used by ethnic minority communities, and the barrier in trust that must be surmounted to put one's faith in other people to handle money. But with the Covid-19 pandemic, a younger generation of North Americans with an interest in sharing resources and the technology to do so efficiently - from crowdfunding to forms of ""caremongering"" - roscas are bound to be a savings method that continue and evolve and expand. For Mayra Martinez, 30, a university administration professional in Dallas, Texas, being in tandas has helped her learn about trust and foster a sense of obligation to save, which can otherwise be hard for young people like herself she says. ""It's not like your commitment to yourself, where you can easily say 'hmm, I'm not going to do that this month because I just don't want to,"" she says. It is an added layer of security in an economic world that has been particularly unpredictable for young professionals, which Ms Martinez says she has seen first-hand - her sister and brother-in-law each recently tested positive for Covid-19 and could not work. ""She just happened to get her tanda this week,"" says Ms Martinez. Because of that, Ms Martinez says, her sister was able to tell her husband: ""It's ok"". The tanda Ms Martinez is involved in now consists of family members from all generations and is run by her mother. Would she ever take over and start one for her own cohort of siblings and cousins once the older generations retire from such schemes? ""I wouldn't mind running one,"" she says, adding with a laugh, ""but it depends on which cousins.""

What is self-isolation and who has to do it?Where do the 13.9 million people under new rules live?,"The latest Covid booster campaign is under way across the UK and those who qualify are urged to get jabbed as soon as possible. No Covid restrictions are in place across the UK, but guidance recommends people who catch the virus ""should try to stay at home"". Many of the symptomsare similar to those for colds and flu,externaland include: high temperature, fever or chills continuous cough loss of, or change in, your normal sense of taste or smell shortness of breath feeling tired or exhausted aching body headache sore throat blocked or runny nose loss of appetite diarrhoea feeling sick or being sick Most people feel better within a few days or weeks - but for some, it can be more serious. Those concerned their or their child's symptoms are worsening should request an urgent GP appointment or help fromNHS 111,external. WHO charts rapid spread of new JN.1 Covid variant Why Covid is still flooring some people Between 2% and 20% of people catching Covidgo on to have longer-term symptoms, ""long Covid"", research suggests. In March, the Office for National Statistics (ONS)estimated 1.9 million people in the UK (2.9% of the population),externalstill had symptoms more than four weeks after their initial infection. There is no simple test for long Covid, andpeople report a variety of symptoms,external, including: extreme tiredness shortness of breath muscle aches memory and concentration problems (""brain fog"") Some people have developed long Covid after an initial mild infection. What are the symptoms of long Covid? Get NHS help with Covid recovery,external Routine Covid testing is not recommended, and most people can't get free tests via the NHS. You may stillbe able to get free NHS tests,externalif you: have a health condition that makes you eligible for treatment if you test positive work in healthcare or a hospice You can buy a test for about Â£2 from High Street and online chemists, but cannot report these test results to the NHS. People are largely advised to treat Covid like any other respiratory disease. You no longer have to self-isolate after testing positive. However, the government recommends trying to stay home for five days - or three for under-18s, as younger people tend to be infectious for a shorter period. People at higher risk of becoming seriously ill with Covid who have been told they areentitled to treatments if they catch it,externalmust report their test result so the NHS can contact them about their options. How to look after yourself if you get Covid Some people are infectious for about five days but others may be contagious for up to 10. Those who have a high temperature or still feel unwell after five days are advised to stay home if they can until they: feel well enough for your normal activities no longer have a high temperature You don't have to tell your employer you have Covid. However, you are asked to avoid contact with others for five days, which means you should work from home if you can, especially if you have a high temperature. The specific schemes offering financial support to those isolating during the pandemic have ended. But you may be entitled toStatutory Sick Pay,external- worth Â£109.40 a week. Under-18s who test positive for Covid are advised to stay at home for three days. NHS guidance saysif a child has mild symptoms such as a runny nose, sore throat or mild cough,external- and they feel well enough - they can go to school or childcare. In the UK, you canonly have the Covid vaccine via the NHS,externalif you meet certain criteria. For most people, vaccinations are now available only as part of a seasonal rollout.  You cannot currently buy them privately. The 2023 autumn booster campaign is targeting: residents in care homes for older adults over-65s people aged six months to 64 years in a clinical risk group front-line health and social-care workers 12-64-year-olds who are household contacts of people with weakened immune systems 16-64-year-olds who are carers or work in care homes for older adults pregnant women The NHS has been contacting eligible people. You canno longer book a Covid jab online or by calling NHS 119,external- but you may be able to with a local NHS vaccination serviceor you can find a walk-in site,external. This round of seasonal Covid jabs will be available until 31 January. Moderna told BBC News ithoped its Covid jab would be on sale in the UK from 2024. Pfizer is also exploring options for private provision. Who can get another Covid jab this autumn? If you have Covid, or think you might,NHS advice is to delay vaccination until you feel better,external. It also recommends waiting if you have a high temperature or feel otherwise unwell with any illness. But there is no need to wait if you have recently recovered from Covid and feel well. The vaccines do not infect people with Covid and cannot cause positive test results.

"Covid restrictions could last six months, says PM","PM Boris Johnson says coronavirus rules could be even further tightened In a TV address he said there had been too many breaches He called on the British public to 'get through the winter together' Pubs, bars and restaurants must close at 22:00 from Thursday in England and Wales, and from Friday in Scotland Different households not allowed to meet indoors in Scotland from Friday, the first minister says Children under 12 in Scotland are to be exempt from all outdoor household meeting limits The US coronavirus death toll has passed 200,000, Johns Hopkins University says Cases in Mexico surpass 700,000 - Latin America is the worst hit region Over 31.2 million Covid-19 cases are confirmed worldwide, with more than 960,000 deaths Martha Buckley That's all for our live coverage today. Join us again tomorrow for more of the latest news on coronavirus as it happens. Today's contributors were Sean Fanning, Chris Clayton, Martha Buckley, Marie Jackson, Georgina Rannard, Doug Faulkner, Jennifer Scott, Penny Spiller, Paul Seddon and Justin Parkinson. If you are just joining us, or have been overwhelmed by the number of announcements, here are some of today's headlines from around the UK:  Thank you for following our coverage
of the coronavirus pandemic. Hereâs a quick reminder of the major stories from around
the world: Among today's announcements is the introduction of a 10pm closing time for the hospitality industry, as well as a table service-only rule. The news has been greeted with concern by businesses in the sector. Tom Stainer, chief executive of the Campaign for Real Ale, said pub customers and publicans wanted to stop the spread of the virus but said the government hadn't shown the evidence that pubs were disproportionately contributing to increased infections. ""It is additional pressure on already fragile pubs which are at real risk of closure,"" he said, pointing out there was currently no support on offer from the government. Mr Stainer added the curfew would cut into several hours of ""high trading times"" at a time when the industry needed to pay off debts after the lockdown. Andy Lennox, founder of Zim Braai restaurants, said his business had lost 30% of its revenue ""overnight"" with the 10pm closing time and it was going to be ""very difficult"". ""The big thing now is what the support going to be, we need some kind of more flexi-furlough brought in that will allow us to add new employees to that, the VAT needs to stay - that 5% is massive,"" he said. Mr Lennox added that Eat Out To Help Out had helped in August - but had only made back losses the industry had already suffered. There have been national protests calling for more protective equipment for health workers The US Congress approved a whopping $3tn emergency funding to fight the coronavirus pandemic back in March. But could it be that some of the money did not go to where it was intended? That is the claim in a Washington Post report, which says $1bn earmarked for the US Defence Department to boost a shortage of medical supplies instead went on patching up gaps in military equipment procurement for items such as jet engines, body armour and uniforms. Some defence contractors, the Washington Post goes on to say, had already tapped into other bail-out measures, such as the job-protection scheme. Analysts say officials are struggling to account for some of the Congress-approved funds. There has been no response yet from the Pentagon. You can read the story in the Washington Posthere,external.  Northern Ireland's First Minister Arlene Foster has described new restrictions in the nation asa ""wake-up call"". She said the ""tough"" new measures, which include banning different households from mixing indoors, were not a second lockdown, while Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neil called for a big push to curb the rise in cases during a joint televised address. Mrs Foster said the actions being taken were ""designed to prevent the need for a return to lockdown"". ""We have risen to the challenge many times before,"" she said. Ms O'Neill said: ""The choices you make could be the difference between life and death for those closest to you."" The new measures came into effect at 18:00. The government has published its updated guidance for coronavirus measure in England, following Boris Johnson's televised address. Here are some the changes: Read the updated guidancehere,external. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey says the PM ""must
take responsibility for what has gone wrong"" with ""his 'world-beating' test-and-trace system"". He calls it ""inexcusable"" that this has been ""overwhelmed"" in recent weeks. West Ham United manager David Moyes and two of his players have tested positive for coronavirus,the club has said. Moyes, 57, defender Issa Diop, 23, and 24-year-old midfielder Josh Cullen will now be required to self-isolate. ""The manager and both players immediately left the stadium and have returned home,"" said a club statement. The club was told of the results ahead of its Carabao Cup tie against Hull City on Tuesday. Pubs, bars and restaurants in Wales must only provide a table service and will have to close at 22:00 from Thursday, the Welsh First Minister has confirmed. In a televised address Mark Drakeford warned: ""In the weeks and months ahead of us, there is a very real possibility we could see coronavirus regain a foothold in our local communities, towns and cities. None of us wants to see that happen again."" He said some parts of south Wales had seen the sharpest rise in cases and were already under strict local measures but said ""we now need to make that difference across Wales"". Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she recognised the latest restrictions may feel like a ""step backwards"", but urged Scots to stick with them, insisting they ""will make a difference"". She said through collective efforts the virus had been beaten back but warned that over winter ""the challenge is once again getting harder"". ""But please know that thanks to all your efforts over the last six months, we are in a much stronger position than in the spring,"" she added. ""Cases are rising but less rapidly than back then."" Analysis Alex ForsythPolitical correspondent While Labour broadly supports the stricter
measures the partyâs criticism centres on two points; the party says the Test
and Trace system isnât working and itâs repeatedly called for more financial
support for sectors that have been adversely affected by restrictions. That
pressureâs growing; including from some on the Tory benches concerned about the
impact of a restricted economy on businesses. For Labour, shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth says the PM should not be ""phasing out"" the furlough scheme, which is due to finish at the end of next month. He tells the BBC preserving public health and the economy does not represent an ""either/or"" choice for the government. Mr Ashworth accuses ministers of ignoring ""all the warnings"" on the coronavirus testing system. Prime Minister Boris Johnson
- in a televised message to the country â reiterated the governmentâs new âtougher
package of measuresâ designed to curb the rise in coronavirus infection. New restrictions for
England are expected to last for the next six months. These include pubs and
restaurants closing from 10pm, the compulsory wearing of face masks and
coverings for shop workers, people advised to work from home âwherever
possibleâ and tougher enforcement of rule-breaking. Thereâs more detail on the new
ruleshere.  Alex ForsythPolitical correspondent Boris
Johnson adopted a similar line to the one he used in Parliament earlier - that of acting now to prevent more onerous restrictions later Both politically and economically, the government is
desperate to avoid another wholesale lockdown and hopes these measures will
help. When he addressed MPs earlier, the PMâs assertion that these new measures might be in
place for six months was stark. Now heâs offering a sprinkling of optimism by
saying things will be better by the spring, but that doesnât mean the country
isnât in for a few tough and uncertain months. Alex ForsythPolitical correspondent Some have suggested the government should
allow people to take more personal risk. Yesterday, the Chief Medical Officer for England, Chris Whitty, said increasing the risk for individuals increased the risk for everyone. Now, Boris Johnson is echoing that refrain, saying ""these risks are not our own"" - with Downing Street pushing a sense of national unity and resolve. The PM tells the UK population: ""Never in our history has our collective destiny and our
collective health depended so completely on our individual behaviour."" There will be ""great days ahead"", he predicts, calling for ""discipline"", ""resolve"" and a ""spirit of togetherness that will carry us through"". That ends Boris Johnson's address. Alex ForsythPolitical correspondent The prime minister says this approach carries the support of the main parliamentary
parties, but itâs not without question. Thereâs still tension in the Conservative party
about whether today's measures go far enough, or indeed too far, and what role Parliament
should have in scrutinising them and signing them off. And Labour is among the opposition voices
calling for more financial support for affected sectors and improvements to the
testing system. This video can not be played Coronavirus: PM says health depends on âindividual behaviourâ Boris Johnson says bringing in extra restrictions now will keep shops and schools open. Meanwhile, the NHS is ""better prepared"" than it was when the pandemic first hit the UK, with personal protective equipment, extra beds and Nightingale hospitals in place, he adds. Doctors and medical advisers are ""rightly worried"" at the moment, the prime minister says, but they are ""unanimous that things will be far better
by the spring"", with the ""hope"" of a vaccine by then and more efficient mass testing. That is the ""hope"" and the ""dream"", he adds. Boris Johnson says he's ""deeply, spiritually reluctant"" to curb civil liberties, but the virus can't be allowed to get out of control or NHS patients with ""non-Covid needs"" will suffer. Another lockdown would threaten jobs and ""the loving human contact"" on which we all depend"", he adds. Education would suffer and loneliness would grow, the PM argues. Alex ForsythPolitical correspondent It goes without saying the prime minister only addresses the
nation when No 10 thinks itâs needed. It is a sign of the extraordinary and
difficult year it's been that this may feel familiar now to some people at home. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."

Analysts say officials are struggling to account for some of the Congress-approved funds. There has been no response yet from the Pentagon.

She said the ""tough"" new measures, which include banning different households from mixing indoors, were not a second lockdown, while Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neil called for a big push to curb the rise in cases during a joint televised address. Mrs Foster said the actions being taken were ""designed to prevent the need for a return to lockdown"". ""We have risen to the challenge many times before,"" she said. Ms O'Neill said: ""The choices you make could be the difference between life and death for those closest to you."" The new measures came into effect at 18:00. The government has published its updated guidance for coronavirus measure in England, following Boris Johnson's televised address. Here are some the changes: Read the updated guidancehere,external. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey says the PM ""must
take responsibility for what has gone wrong"" with ""his 'world-beating' test-and-trace system"". He calls it ""inexcusable"" that this has been ""overwhelmed"" in recent weeks. West Ham United manager David Moyes and two of his players have tested positive for coronavirus,the club has said. Moyes, 57, defender Issa Diop, 23, and 24-year-old midfielder Josh Cullen will now be required to self-isolate. ""The manager and both players immediately left the stadium and have returned home,"" said a club statement. The club was told of the results ahead of its Carabao Cup tie against Hull City on Tuesday. Pubs, bars and restaurants in Wales must only provide a table service and will have to close at 22:00 from Thursday, the Welsh First Minister has confirmed. In a televised address Mark Drakeford warned: ""In the weeks and months ahead of us, there is a very real possibility we could see coronavirus regain a foothold in our local communities, towns and cities. None of us wants to see that happen again."" He said some parts of south Wales had seen the sharpest rise in cases and were already under strict local measures but said ""we now need to make that difference across Wales"". Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she recognised the latest restrictions may feel like a ""step backwards"", but urged Scots to stick with them, insisting they ""will make a difference"". She said through collective efforts the virus had been beaten back but warned that over winter ""the challenge is once again getting harder"". ""But please know that thanks to all your efforts over the last six months, we are in a much stronger position than in the spring,"" she added. ""Cases are rising but less rapidly than back then."" Analysis Alex ForsythPolitical correspondent While Labour broadly supports the stricter
measures the partyâs criticism centres on two points; the party says the Test
and Trace system isnât working and itâs repeatedly called for more financial
support for sectors that have been adversely affected by restrictions. That
pressureâs growing; including from some on the Tory benches concerned about the
impact of a restricted economy on businesses. For Labour, shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth says the PM should not be ""phasing out"" the furlough scheme, which is due to finish at the end of next month. He tells the BBC preserving public health and the economy does not represent an ""either/or"" choice for the government. Mr Ashworth accuses ministers of ignoring ""all the warnings"" on the coronavirus testing system. Prime Minister Boris Johnson
- in a televised message to the country â reiterated the governmentâs new âtougher
package of measuresâ designed to curb the rise in coronavirus infection. New restrictions for
England are expected to last for the next six months. These include pubs and
restaurants closing from 10pm, the compulsory wearing of face masks and
coverings for shop workers, people advised to work from home âwherever
possibleâ and tougher enforcement of rule-breaking. Thereâs more detail on the new
ruleshere.  Alex ForsythPolitical correspondent Boris
Johnson adopted a similar line to the one he used in Parliament earlier - that of acting now to prevent more onerous restrictions later Both politically and economically, the government is
desperate to avoid another wholesale lockdown and hopes these measures will
help. When he addressed MPs earlier, the PMâs assertion that these new measures might be in
place for six months was stark. Now heâs offering a sprinkling of optimism by
saying things will be better by the spring, but that doesnât mean the country
isnât in for a few tough and uncertain months. Alex ForsythPolitical correspondent Some have suggested the government should
allow people to take more personal risk. Yesterday, the Chief Medical Officer for England, Chris Whitty, said increasing the risk for individuals increased the risk for everyone. Now, Boris Johnson is echoing that refrain, saying ""these risks are not our own"" - with Downing Street pushing a sense of national unity and resolve. The PM tells the UK population: ""Never in our history has our collective destiny and our
collective health depended so completely on our individual behaviour."" There will be ""great days ahead"", he predicts, calling for ""discipline"", ""resolve"" and a ""spirit of togetherness that will carry us through"". That ends Boris Johnson's address. Alex ForsythPolitical correspondent The prime minister says this approach carries the support of the main parliamentary
parties, but itâs not without question. Thereâs still tension in the Conservative party
about whether today's measures go far enough, or indeed too far, and what role Parliament
should have in scrutinising them and signing them off. And Labour is among the opposition voices
calling for more financial support for affected sectors and improvements to the
testing system. This video can not be played Coronavirus: PM says health depends on âindividual behaviourâ Boris Johnson says bringing in extra restrictions now will keep shops and schools open. Meanwhile, the NHS is ""better prepared"" than it was when the pandemic first hit the UK, with personal protective equipment, extra beds and Nightingale hospitals in place, he adds. Doctors and medical advisers are ""rightly worried"" at the moment, the prime minister says, but they are ""unanimous that things will be far better
by the spring"", with the ""hope"" of a vaccine by then and more efficient mass testing. That is the ""hope"" and the ""dream"", he adds. Boris Johnson says he's ""deeply, spiritually reluctant"" to curb civil liberties, but the virus can't be allowed to get out of control or NHS patients with ""non-Covid needs"" will suffer. Another lockdown would threaten jobs and ""the loving human contact"" on which we all depend"", he adds. Education would suffer and loneliness would grow, the PM argues. Alex ForsythPolitical correspondent It goes without saying the prime minister only addresses the
nation when No 10 thinks itâs needed. It is a sign of the extraordinary and
difficult year it's been that this may feel familiar now to some people at home. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
'We've reached a perilous turning point' - PM,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""It would be tempting to think the threat had faded"" The UK has reached ""a perilous turning point"", Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said, as he set out a raft of new coronavirus restrictions for England which could last for up to six months. Shop staff will have to wear face masks and weddings will be limited to a maximum of 15 people, under the rules. Fines for breaking laws on gatherings and not wearing a mask will increase to Â£200 for a first offence. He also warned ""significantly greater restrictions"" could come if necessary. Mr Johnson said ""similar steps"" would be taken across the UK after he met with the leaders of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland on Tuesday morning. Like England, Scotland's First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, also announced a 22:00 curfew for hospitality businesses. The same measure is also set tocome into force in Waleson Thursday. But Ms Sturgeon went further than England on restrictions,banning the visiting of other households indoors. It comes as the number of UK cases rose by 4,926 on Tuesday,government figures showed,external, with deaths increasing by 37. New rules a balancing act of science and politics How have the rules changed? How many cases are there in your area? Where do I have to wear a face covering now? Weddings: 'We have to phone 15 people and un-invite them' Speaking in the House of Common, the prime minister told MPs: ""We always knew that while we might have driven the virus into retreat, the prospect of a second wave was real. I'm sorry to say that, as in Spain and France and many other countries, we've reached a perilous turning point."" Mr Johnson said the new rules were ""carefully judged"" to achieve the maximum reduction in the R number - which measures how quickly the virus is spreading - while causing ""the minimum damage to lives and livelihoods"". But he said this was ""by no means a return to the full lockdown of March"", with no general instructions to stay at home. Businesses, schools, colleges and universities will remain open. Attendance figures showthe number of schools in England sending home groups of pupils due to Covid-19 incidents quadrupled in a week. This video can not be played Covid restrictions: PM addresses the Commons, telling MPs of new hospitality and face covering rules In the last fortnight, hospital admissions have doubled and Covid-19 is likely to spread faster in winter, Mr Johnson said, adding: ""So this is the moment when we must act."" If these restrictions fail to bring the R number below one - the point where the epidemic is no longer growing - ""then we reserve the right to deploy greater fire power with significantly greater restrictions"" he said. Thelatest R estimate for the whole of the UK is between 1.1 and 1.4. Mr Johnson said: ""We will spare no effort in developing vaccines, treatments, new forms of mass-testing but unless we palpably make progress we should assume that the restrictions that I have announced will remain in place for perhaps six months."" Under the new measures for England: Office workers are being toldto work from home again if possible Penalties for not wearing a mask or gathering in groups of more than six will increase to Â£200 on the first offence From Thursday 24 September, all pubs, bars and restaurants will be restricted to table service only. Takeaways can continue Also from Thursday,hospitality venues must close at 22:00- which means shutting then, not calling for last orders (in Scotland the same curfew rule comes into force on Friday) Face coverings must be worn by taxi drivers and passengers from Wednesday Retail staff and customers in indoor hospitality venues will also have to wear masks from Thursday, except when seated at a table to eat or drink From Monday 28 September, only 15 people will be able to attend weddings and civil partnerships, in groups of six. Funerals can still take place with up to 30 people Also from 28 September, you can only play indoor adult sports in groups of less than six The planned return of spectators to sports venues will now not go ahead from 1 October Mr Johnson also said the government would provide police and local authorities in England with extra funding to enforce the regulations, with the option to draw on military support. Restating her support for people working from home, Scotland's first minister also announced her government might impose a ""legal duty"" on employers to allow home working. Ms Sturgeon said enforcement of coronavirus rules for the public in Scotland was ""under review"", but added: ""Supporting people to do the right thing is much more effective than threatening harsh punishment if they cannot."" The first minister also said the new restrictions on visiting other households would be reviewed every three weeks - and stressed that they would ""not necessarily"" be in place for as long as six months. The new restrictions in England amount to little more than a tinkering around the edges. Last week there was talk of mini lockdowns and circuit breaks. But with hospital admissions and deaths still low, there is a window of opportunity to see what impact these new measures will have. While the rapid growth put forward by the government's chief pandemic advisers on Monday that cases could reach 50,000 a day by mid-October is unlikely to be realised, according to many, the chances are infection rates will continue to climb. This is a virus which can be transmitted silently - people are infectious before symptoms develop, while some do not even develop any - and we are entering the time of year when respiratory illnesses circulate more and deaths start to increase. If and when this happens, the government will need to decide how far it is prepared to go. The same applies for the rest of the UK nations despite the tighter restrictions there on visiting people's homes. A full lockdown is highly unlikely, but more significant steps such as closing hospitality venues, leisure facilities and curbing everyday activities from playing sport to travelling around the country remain options. But the horrible question that will be asked is this: How much economic pain, disruption and damage to wider health and wellbeing is worth the lives that are at risk? The really tough calls are still to come. Read more from Nick. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he supported ""necessary"" stricter measures, but added that families were worried ""the government doesn't have a strategy"". ""One day people were encouraged to work in the office, in fact more than encouraged they were openly challenged by the prime minister for not doing so. Today they're told the opposite,"" he said. ""This is a time of national crisis but we need clear leadership."" This video can not be played Labour leader Keir Starmer accuses the government of not having a ""clear strategy"" for the pandemic Sir Keir also said it would be a ""disaster"" to withdraw the furlough scheme - which is due to end next month - in ""one fell swoop"" with no additional support for people whose jobs might be at risk. The governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey,suggested some sectors may benefit from further targeted help. SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? SUPPORT BUBBLES:What are they and who can be in yours? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? WEDDINGS:Can I have a reception with guests? SOCIAL LIFE:Is it safe to go to the pub? The Confederation of British Industry, which represents business, also called for a targeted replacement for the furlough scheme. ""It has saved thousands and thousands of jobs but there is a cliff-edge looming. And, now, with today's announcement that is more urgent than ever,"" said director general Dame Carolyn Fairbairn. Some business owners said the latest rules would make life even harder. Marc Gough, who runs a crockery and glassware business in the wedding and events sector, said the cut to the limit for weddings to 15 was ""heart breaking"". ""I can't earn a living because you're restricting me to weddings of 15 people,"" Mr Gough told BBC Radio 5 live, adding that the turnover of his business had fallen from Â£750,000 to Â£20,000. ""To walk into that warehouse, to put a smile on my face to the staff that I have left, to the clients that I deal with constantly, the brides, it's truly heart breaking,"" he said.

Plan for fans to return in October is off,"Brighton hosted Chelsea in a friendly in August that saw 2,500 fans attend with social distancing in place Fans may not to be able to return to watch live sporting events in England until the end of March at the earliest. At a meeting on Tuesday, sports governing bodies - including those from football, rugby, cricket, Formula 1 and horse racing - were told to prepare for no spectators throughout the winter. Officials from the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) told the meeting, which was attended by Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden, that the ban on fans will be kept under review. Premiership Rugby chief executive Darren Childs said: ""The announcement that supporters will not be allowed into stadiums for up to six months cuts off crucial revenue for clubs who have already suffered significant financial losses from suspending the season and playing matches behind closed doors since March. ""We believe the lack of supporters in our grounds could cause irreparable damage to our clubs and the communities they serve, so we must find a way forward to avoid this."" Ralph Rimmer, the chief executive of the Rugby Football League (RFL), added: ""Today's call specifically focused on the postponement of the pilot event programme and the plans for socially distanced crowds and the further serious impact this will now have on sports. ""The secretary of state indicated that the postponement may last throughout the winter. The impact on rugby league and other sports is profound."" Earlier on Tuesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson outlined a range of new restrictions for the country, including confirmation that plans to allow fans to return to sport from 1 October would not go ahead. The plans had beenplaced under reviewearlier this month after a rise in coronavirus cases. The UK's Covid-19 alert level has moved to 4, meaning transmission is ""high or rising exponentially"". The prime minister also said restrictions are likely to remain in place for the next six months. ""We have to acknowledge the spread of the virus is now affecting our ability to reopen large sporting events,"" said the prime minister. 'Delayed return of fans is devastating for clubs, their employees and local businesses' Premier League clubs consider alternatives after proposed return of fans scrapped In an address to the Commons on Tuesday, Johnson announced new restrictions for the country and those included the halting of the phased return of fans. ""We will not be able to do this from 1 October and I recognise the implications for our sports clubs, which are the life and soul of our communities,"" he added. ""The chancellor and the culture secretary are working urgently on what we can do now to support them."" The pilot programme, which was to trial events of up to 1,000 spectators, has also been paused. Two Premiership rugby union matches - Bath v Gloucester on Tuesday and Bristol v Leicester next week - will now be played behind closed doors, as will a horse racing meeting at Newmarket later this week. The majority of sports in England have been played behind closed doors since the coronavirus lockdown in March, including Premier League football fixtures and the FA Cup final, England's Test cricket matches and two Formula 1 races at Silverstone. This video can not be played How long can football clubs survive without the return of fans in the stadium? Sport events that took place with full crowds in March shortly before all fixtures were postponed and the UK locked down have come under scrutiny. The impact of Liverpool's Champions League fixture against Atletico Madrid on the spread of coronavirus is beinginvestigated by the city's council,while there have also been calls for an investigation into whether horse racing's Cheltenham Festivalshould have gone ahead. The government defended its decision to allow such events to proceed before restrictions on mass gatherings were introduced. ""People look back now at the beginning of the pandemic at some of the major sporting events then and ask the question why were they allowed to go ahead,"" said Cabinet Secretary Michael Gove on BBC Breakfast earlier on Tuesday. ""What we must do is look at sporting events now with caution but we also recognise that sport is a vital part of this nation and we're looking at everything we can do to support our athletes, our great clubs, through what will be a challenging time."" Julian Knight, the chair of the DCMS select committee, said: ""If we don't find a route map with smart solutions to allow sports and live events to gradually reopen, we risk decimation of our sporting and cultural infrastructure."" The leaders of more than 100 sports bodies have written to the prime minister to ask for emergency funding,warning of ""a lost generation of activity""because of coronavirus. Sport England has handed out Â£200m for emergency cases, but many in the sector believe more is needed. Earlier this month, Premier League chief executive Richard Masters told BBC Sportit was ""absolutely critical""fans were allowed back inside stadiums as soon as possible and failure to do so would cost clubs Â£700m during the 2020-21 season. English Football League (EFL) clubs lost Â£50m in gate receipts last season andestimate a Â£200m lossif there are no fans this season. The Rugby Football Union (RFU) said no spectators at the forthcoming Autumn Nations Cup or Six Nations will result in losses of Â£60m. RFL chief executive Rimmerurged the government not to delay the return of crowds,with clubs facing a potential impact on revenues of ""up to Â£2m per week"". At the end of August, 2,500 people watched a friendly between Brighton and Chelsea at the Seagulls' Amex Stadium - the first time fans had been allowed into a Premier League ground for almost six months. About 300 spectatorswere allowed to watchlast month's World Snooker Championship final between Ronnie O'Sullivan and Kyren Wilson at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield, but original plans to admit fans for all days of the tournament were reversed. Arsenal's 9-1 victory over West Ham in the Women's Super League on 12 September saw up to 1,000 fans attend. More than 2,500 spectators bought tickets for the first day of the St Leger meeting at Doncaster on 9 September, the first crowd at a British horse racing fixture in six months - but the rest of the meeting wasthen held behind closed doors. Also on Tuesday, it was confirmed that indoor recreational team sports such as netball, basketball and five-a-side football will not be able to continue under the new restrictions, which limit numbers taking part to six. Larger fitness classes will be permitted, as long as they are organised so those taking part do not mix in groups of more than six. Elite indoor sports are exempt, as are indoor sports played by children. This is grim news for British sport, which teeters on the brink of an unprecedented crisis. On one hand, it is no surprise, given rising cases of Covid-19, tighter restrictions and the criticism the government received for allowing events like the Cheltenham Festival to continue in March and not shutting down sooner. The optics of allowing thousands of fans to travel to grounds while encouraging people to work from home was also seen as insurmountable. But it will infuriate sports governing bodies that insist it is much safer for fans to be in highly regulated, socially distanced, often open-air venues and stadiums than watching on the TV in pubs, for instance. They are not aware of any data or research which proves the return of fans would increase transmission. And they point to the fact that countries like Germany are allowing thousands of fans back inside grounds. Sports are now being warned to brace themselves for several months without fans and report back to DCMS officials what impact this will have on their finances. For the EFL and rugby clubs in particular, where matchday revenue is crucial, the answer will be potentially devastating. From non-league football and Olympic sports, through to grassroots clubs and community leisure facilities, the sector fears an existential crisis which could cost thousands of jobs and result in a slump in participation. Pressure will now build on the government to come up with a similar emergency fund to the Â£1.57bn bailout the arts sector was handed in the summer. Calls for the Premier League to help prop up the football pyramid will also intensify.

LiveLiveUK's PM to address MPs on new restrictionsLess than a minute ago,"PM Boris Johnson says coronavirus rules could be even further tightened In a TV address he said there had been too many breaches He called on the British public to 'get through the winter together' Pubs, bars and restaurants must close at 22:00 from Thursday in England and Wales, and from Friday in Scotland Different households not allowed to meet indoors in Scotland from Friday, the first minister says Children under 12 in Scotland are to be exempt from all outdoor household meeting limits The US coronavirus death toll has passed 200,000, Johns Hopkins University says Cases in Mexico surpass 700,000 - Latin America is the worst hit region Over 31.2 million Covid-19 cases are confirmed worldwide, with more than 960,000 deaths Martha Buckley That's all for our live coverage today. Join us again tomorrow for more of the latest news on coronavirus as it happens. Today's contributors were Sean Fanning, Chris Clayton, Martha Buckley, Marie Jackson, Georgina Rannard, Doug Faulkner, Jennifer Scott, Penny Spiller, Paul Seddon and Justin Parkinson. If you are just joining us, or have been overwhelmed by the number of announcements, here are some of today's headlines from around the UK:  Thank you for following our coverage
of the coronavirus pandemic. Hereâs a quick reminder of the major stories from around
the world: Among today's announcements is the introduction of a 10pm closing time for the hospitality industry, as well as a table service-only rule. The news has been greeted with concern by businesses in the sector. Tom Stainer, chief executive of the Campaign for Real Ale, said pub customers and publicans wanted to stop the spread of the virus but said the government hadn't shown the evidence that pubs were disproportionately contributing to increased infections. ""It is additional pressure on already fragile pubs which are at real risk of closure,"" he said, pointing out there was currently no support on offer from the government. Mr Stainer added the curfew would cut into several hours of ""high trading times"" at a time when the industry needed to pay off debts after the lockdown. Andy Lennox, founder of Zim Braai restaurants, said his business had lost 30% of its revenue ""overnight"" with the 10pm closing time and it was going to be ""very difficult"". ""The big thing now is what the support going to be, we need some kind of more flexi-furlough brought in that will allow us to add new employees to that, the VAT needs to stay - that 5% is massive,"" he said. Mr Lennox added that Eat Out To Help Out had helped in August - but had only made back losses the industry had already suffered. There have been national protests calling for more protective equipment for health workers The US Congress approved a whopping $3tn emergency funding to fight the coronavirus pandemic back in March. But could it be that some of the money did not go to where it was intended? That is the claim in a Washington Post report, which says $1bn earmarked for the US Defence Department to boost a shortage of medical supplies instead went on patching up gaps in military equipment procurement for items such as jet engines, body armour and uniforms. Some defence contractors, the Washington Post goes on to say, had already tapped into other bail-out measures, such as the job-protection scheme. Analysts say officials are struggling to account for some of the Congress-approved funds. There has been no response yet from the Pentagon.

Ms O'Neill said: ""The choices you make could be the difference between life and death for those closest to you."" The new measures came into effect at 18:00. The government has published its updated guidance for coronavirus measure in England, following Boris Johnson's televised address. Here are some the changes: Read the updated guidancehere,external. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey says the PM ""must
take responsibility for what has gone wrong"" with ""his 'world-beating' test-and-trace system"". He calls it ""inexcusable"" that this has been ""overwhelmed"" in recent weeks. West Ham United manager David Moyes and two of his players have tested positive for coronavirus,the club has said. Moyes, 57, defender Issa Diop, 23, and 24-year-old midfielder Josh Cullen will now be required to self-isolate. ""The manager and both players immediately left the stadium and have returned home,"" said a club statement. The club was told of the results ahead of its Carabao Cup tie against Hull City on Tuesday. Pubs, bars and restaurants in Wales must only provide a table service and will have to close at 22:00 from Thursday, the Welsh First Minister has confirmed. In a televised address Mark Drakeford warned: ""In the weeks and months ahead of us, there is a very real possibility we could see coronavirus regain a foothold in our local communities, towns and cities. None of us wants to see that happen again."" He said some parts of south Wales had seen the sharpest rise in cases and were already under strict local measures but said ""we now need to make that difference across Wales"". Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she recognised the latest restrictions may feel like a ""step backwards"", but urged Scots to stick with them, insisting they ""will make a difference"". She said through collective efforts the virus had been beaten back but warned that over winter ""the challenge is once again getting harder"". ""But please know that thanks to all your efforts over the last six months, we are in a much stronger position than in the spring,"" she added. ""Cases are rising but less rapidly than back then."" Analysis Alex ForsythPolitical correspondent While Labour broadly supports the stricter
measures the partyâs criticism centres on two points; the party says the Test
and Trace system isnât working and itâs repeatedly called for more financial
support for sectors that have been adversely affected by restrictions. That
pressureâs growing; including from some on the Tory benches concerned about the
impact of a restricted economy on businesses. For Labour, shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth says the PM should not be ""phasing out"" the furlough scheme, which is due to finish at the end of next month. He tells the BBC preserving public health and the economy does not represent an ""either/or"" choice for the government. Mr Ashworth accuses ministers of ignoring ""all the warnings"" on the coronavirus testing system. Prime Minister Boris Johnson

saying things will be better by the spring, but that doesnât mean the country
isnât in for a few tough and uncertain months. Alex ForsythPolitical correspondent Some have suggested the government should
allow people to take more personal risk. Yesterday, the Chief Medical Officer for England, Chris Whitty, said increasing the risk for individuals increased the risk for everyone. Now, Boris Johnson is echoing that refrain, saying ""these risks are not our own"" - with Downing Street pushing a sense of national unity and resolve. The PM tells the UK population: ""Never in our history has our collective destiny and our
collective health depended so completely on our individual behaviour."" There will be ""great days ahead"", he predicts, calling for ""discipline"", ""resolve"" and a ""spirit of togetherness that will carry us through"". That ends Boris Johnson's address. Alex ForsythPolitical correspondent The prime minister says this approach carries the support of the main parliamentary
parties, but itâs not without question. Thereâs still tension in the Conservative party
about whether today's measures go far enough, or indeed too far, and what role Parliament
should have in scrutinising them and signing them off. And Labour is among the opposition voices
calling for more financial support for affected sectors and improvements to the
testing system. This video can not be played Coronavirus: PM says health depends on âindividual behaviourâ Boris Johnson says bringing in extra restrictions now will keep shops and schools open.

Waiting for help with post-viral fatigue,"Thousands of coronavirus patients, including many who were not ill enough to be hospitalised, have been suffering for months from fatigue and a range of other symptoms. While professionals struggle to support them, what can they learn from those living with chronic illnesses? If you've been following the stories of people who have contracted coronavirus and are experiencing debilitating symptoms that won't go away, Jade Gray-Christie's story may sound familiar. Because her symptoms were considered ""mild"", she was not hospitalised, but her life has been turned upside down since falling ill in March. Before the pandemic, Jade had been living an extremely busy life. The 32-year-old from Stoke Newington in London was balancing a fulfilling job supporting young people from disadvantaged backgrounds, with an active social life, and going to the gym three times a week. But in the early hours of the morning on 15 March, Jade came home from a long day at work, and knew something wasn't right. ""I felt horrendous. I was starting to feel really hot and cold and I just kept coughing and coughing and coughing,"" Jade told me, speaking softly, through laboured breaths. As the days went by, Jade, who is asthmatic and lives alone, started to feel more and more unwell and scared. She called 111. They sent an ambulance to her ground-floor flat, but the paramedics refused to come in. ""They spoke to me through the window and asked what was going on,"" she says. Lying in bed and struggling to get the words out, Jade explained that she was finding it hard to breathe and had severe pains in her chest. She was told that she had the classic ""Covid cough"", but because of her age, they couldn't take her to the hospital. She was young, they said, and her body was strong enough to recover. Jade was taken aback. ""What do I do about my breathing? I'm asthmatic. I live by myself so if something happens I've got nobody to support me. What do I do?"" But she was told that they weren't taking anyone under the age of 70 in case she made someone else in the hospital ill. ""So I was kind of just left,"" Jade says. ""I understood what they were saying, but at the same time I was really poorly and I didn't know what would happen. I was quite scared to go to sleep at night."" Jade started leaving her front door unlocked, asking her neighbours to check on her daily to make sure that nothing happened to her as she slept. As time went by, she did seem to slowly improve. But every time she thought she was making a recovery, her symptoms returned. In May, Jade felt well enough to start working part-time from home. She was still experiencing chest pains and some tiredness, but as someone who was used to a busy life, she felt she could manage. Then, at the end of the month, something changed. ""My chest got really bad again. I was struggling to breathe and I wasn't able to get out of my bed,"" she says. ""My fatigue was like nothing I've ever experienced before."" Jade has been given two more inhalers for Covid symptoms as well as the one she needs for asthma Months passed with little improvement. Sometimes she slept more than 16 hours per day, and struggled with the day-to-day activities needed to look after herself. When I checked in on Jade at the end of July, she told me that her doctor said she had post-viral fatigue - but she hadn't been given any advice on how to manage her symptoms beyond being told to ""pace"" and have a routine for sleeping and waking. Pacing is a skill that involves breaking challenging elements of your life into smaller, more manageable ones. The idea is to learn coping strategies to help improve quality of life and stabilise your health. But Jade struggled to understand how to apply the idea of pacing to her life. Keeping to a routine felt almost impossible, as she often woke up exhausted and just fell back to sleep again. ""When I did speak with the doctor regarding my dizziness, the fact I have fainted, and also about my fatigue, he openly stated that he did not know how to support me and that the virus is still so new. This of course left me feeling even worse."" ""If the doctors cannot help, then who else can?"" she asked. The World Health Organization (WHO) acknowledges that it does not yet fully understand Covid-19. It says that typical recovery times are two weeks for patients with mild illness, and up to eight weeks for those with severe illness, but it recognises that there are people like Jade who continue to have symptoms for longer. In such cases, the WHO says, symptoms may include extreme fatigue, persistent cough or exercise intolerance. The virus can cause inflammation in the lungs, cardiovascular and neurological systems, and it can take a long time for the body to recover. 'Long Covid' patients need treatment programme, doctors say Why are people remaining ill for so long? Jade's experience has been echoed by tens of thousands of people across the country, and is now known as ""Long Covid"". According to the Covid Symptom Study app, which tracks people's symptoms regardless of whether they had a test, about 300,000 people in the UK have reported symptoms lasting for more than a month, and 60,000 people have been ill for more than three months. Barbara Melville is an admin of the Long Covid Support Group on Facebook, which was set up to provide a place for people to talk about their experiences and support each other. It now has over 21,000 members, who are living with a wide range of symptoms. Interestingly, a lot of people in the group, like Jade, originally had a mild case of coronavirus, though one doctor described Barbara's as ""moderately severe"". Many of them say they are not able to access the care and support they need, and she describes ""two emerging narratives"" when it comes to trying to find help. Some struggle to be taken seriously at all, with people being told, especially early on, that their symptoms are caused by anxiety, she says. Others have sympathetic GPs who will arrange blood tests and chest X-rays or CT scans for lung issues - but once those examinations have been carried out, they are not sure what specialist services to refer them to, or how to help them. ""I think most GPs are at an absolute loss, they don't know what to do for people,"" Barbara says. ""It's about policy. Doctors don't have the guidelines yet to know what to do, so everybody is shooting in the dark."" During the early months of the pandemic, when there was even less help or recognition for people experiencing Long Covid symptoms, many patients and patient advocacy groups started doing their own research. ""You don't know if you're going to live or die, and Covid puts you on a merry-go-round of symptoms - one minute it's pain in kidneys, then stomach. For a lot of people, although not for me, there's also lung issues and shortness of breath,"" says Lorraine Pickering, a former teacher at a busy secondary school in Wiltshire, who developed symptoms in March and has since been diagnosed with Covid. Looking for answers, she turned to the chronic illness community and realised that many of their symptoms overlapped. She found a huge amount of useful advice and support about how to cope with a long-term health condition - learning that with the right adjustments it was still possible to have a fulfilling life. ""If you've never been ill before, it takes a lot of emotional and physical resilience,"" she says. She also noticed that early on in the pandemic, people living with chronic illness were already speculating about the potential long-term repercussions of coronavirus, and were concerned for this new influx of patients. There was a palpable fear that some people wouldn't make a full recovery, and also that this would strain a system where many already struggle to get the care and support that they need. ""The chronic illness community is used to waiting 12 months to see a specialist or spending three hours in a clinic waiting for a 10-minute test, but this may well come as an unpleasant shock to previously healthy folks,"" says Jo Southall, an occupational therapist who specialises in supporting people with chronic illness. ""There were a whole lot of people on waiting lists for rehabilitative care before Covid-19 hit and the backlog has only got worse."" Lauren Walker, an adviser to the Royal College of Occupational Therapists, adds that access to specialists has always been a ""postcode lottery"" and that it is a particular problem for disadvantaged groups. ""It is a really inequitable system,"" she says. Listen to Jade Gray-Christie and Jo Southall on the Ouch! podcast:It is possible to be tired and in pain and happy at the same time Download moreOuch! Cabin Fever podcasts here In an attempt to help the growing number of people with long Covid symptoms, in July the NHS launched an online portal calledYourCovidRecovery,external. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said it would ""give people who have survived the virus on-demand access to online clinical support"" for problems with breathing, mental health or other complications. However, Barbara says the response from her support group has been mixed, with some pointing out that it simply duplicates advice about pacing and breathing exercises that is already available elsewhere online. ""Sufferers are looking for comprehensive support, such as time with specialist consultants. They don't need more of the same,"" she says. But, in many cases, these are the same specialists that there are already long waiting lists to see. Jo Southall has a more positive view of the portal. ""Good quality generic advice is essential in the 'waiting' stages,"" she says. She believes that the most important thing at the moment is to prevent people from getting worse, and one danger she sees is that people could be encouraged to exercise too hard - which could make them more unwell. In July, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellencecautioned against using graded exercise therapy,externalfor patients recovering from Coronavirus. (It also noted that its advice for managing chronic fatigue could be out of date for other groups of patients too. This advice is currently under review.) ""Sometimes no progress is progress,"" Jo says. ""It's all too easy for health to spiral downwards with symptoms like fatigue, so when you're going it alone, a plateau should be seen as a win."" When dealing with fatigue, occupational therapists use something called the three P's: planning, pacing and prioritising This involves identifying strategies to make things easier and manage energy more effectively For example, if showering is exhausting, try it at a different time of day, or sit down instead of standing Break activities up into smaller tasks and spread them throughout the day Plan 30-40 minutes of rest breaks between activities Lauren Walker,Royal College of Occupational Therapists,external So, where does this leave patients? For many, it's still a waiting game. As for Jade, her health is still up and down, but she is now getting physiotherapy and occupational therapy through the Covid clinic at University College Hospital in London. Her employers have been very supportive, which has made a huge difference. When she had an occupational assessment, she was told that they had seen many similar cases. ""That was a huge relief, just to be believed,"" she says, having spent many months feeling as though she had to prove that what was happening to her was not ""all in her head"". She finally received a letter confirming her Covid diagnosis this week. Jade is now planning to work from home for the rest of the year, with reduced hours and responsibilities, and has been advised to break up her day, working in two-hour stints with mini-breaks in between. She's glad to be able to get back to work and engage her brain. Not all employers are as sympathetic, warns Barbara, with many stories being shared in her support group of people forced back to work too soon. ""They're scared that they're not going to be able to feed their families,"" she told me. ""Rest and pacing are a privilege."" Others have told her they're facing discrimination at work because they are unable to provide evidence that they had the illness - even though testing wasn't made widely available for months - and are not being given the adjustments they need to work safely. She is, however, hopeful that this crisis will lead to a culture change in the way people living with long-term health conditions are treated. ""What I'd like to see in five years' time is that someone with Long Covid symptoms, or any illness, can go to the doctor, get the support they need, for the doctor to feel supported, and that people feel able to talk about this with their employers and peers. ""Covid has really highlighted inequalities and there's an opportunity here to start doing something."" In one of our calls, Jade told me that after becoming ill she really felt like her life was over. It was only once she started getting support, care and understanding that things started to change for her. She now feels like she may be able to find a way to cope with her new normal.

LiveLiveUK's PM to address MPs on new restrictions3 minutes ago,"PM Boris Johnson says coronavirus rules could be even further tightened In a TV address he said there had been too many breaches He called on the British public to 'get through the winter together' Pubs, bars and restaurants must close at 22:00 from Thursday in England and Wales, and from Friday in Scotland Different households not allowed to meet indoors in Scotland from Friday, the first minister says Children under 12 in Scotland are to be exempt from all outdoor household meeting limits The US coronavirus death toll has passed 200,000, Johns Hopkins University says Cases in Mexico surpass 700,000 - Latin America is the worst hit region Over 31.2 million Covid-19 cases are confirmed worldwide, with more than 960,000 deaths Martha Buckley That's all for our live coverage today. Join us again tomorrow for more of the latest news on coronavirus as it happens. Today's contributors were Sean Fanning, Chris Clayton, Martha Buckley, Marie Jackson, Georgina Rannard, Doug Faulkner, Jennifer Scott, Penny Spiller, Paul Seddon and Justin Parkinson. If you are just joining us, or have been overwhelmed by the number of announcements, here are some of today's headlines from around the UK:  Thank you for following our coverage
of the coronavirus pandemic. Hereâs a quick reminder of the major stories from around
the world: Among today's announcements is the introduction of a 10pm closing time for the hospitality industry, as well as a table service-only rule. The news has been greeted with concern by businesses in the sector. Tom Stainer, chief executive of the Campaign for Real Ale, said pub customers and publicans wanted to stop the spread of the virus but said the government hadn't shown the evidence that pubs were disproportionately contributing to increased infections. ""It is additional pressure on already fragile pubs which are at real risk of closure,"" he said, pointing out there was currently no support on offer from the government. Mr Stainer added the curfew would cut into several hours of ""high trading times"" at a time when the industry needed to pay off debts after the lockdown. Andy Lennox, founder of Zim Braai restaurants, said his business had lost 30% of its revenue ""overnight"" with the 10pm closing time and it was going to be ""very difficult"". ""The big thing now is what the support going to be, we need some kind of more flexi-furlough brought in that will allow us to add new employees to that, the VAT needs to stay - that 5% is massive,"" he said. Mr Lennox added that Eat Out To Help Out had helped in August - but had only made back losses the industry had already suffered. There have been national protests calling for more protective equipment for health workers The US Congress approved a whopping $3tn emergency funding to fight the coronavirus pandemic back in March. But could it be that some of the money did not go to where it was intended? That is the claim in a Washington Post report, which says $1bn earmarked for the US Defence Department to boost a shortage of medical supplies instead went on patching up gaps in military equipment procurement for items such as jet engines, body armour and uniforms. Some defence contractors, the Washington Post goes on to say, had already tapped into other bail-out measures, such as the job-protection scheme. Analysts say officials are struggling to account for some of the Congress-approved funds. There has been no response yet from the Pentagon. You can read the story in the Washington Posthere,external.  Northern Ireland's First Minister Arlene Foster has described new restrictions in the nation asa ""wake-up call"". She said the ""tough"" new measures, which include banning different households from mixing indoors, were not a second lockdown, while Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neil called for a big push to curb the rise in cases during a joint televised address. Mrs Foster said the actions being taken were ""designed to prevent the need for a return to lockdown"". ""We have risen to the challenge many times before,"" she said. Ms O'Neill said: ""The choices you make could be the difference between life and death for those closest to you."" The new measures came into effect at 18:00. The government has published its updated guidance for coronavirus measure in England, following Boris Johnson's televised address. Here are some the changes: Read the updated guidancehere,external. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey says the PM ""must
take responsibility for what has gone wrong"" with ""his 'world-beating' test-and-trace system"". He calls it ""inexcusable"" that this has been ""overwhelmed"" in recent weeks. West Ham United manager David Moyes and two of his players have tested positive for coronavirus,the club has said. Moyes, 57, defender Issa Diop, 23, and 24-year-old midfielder Josh Cullen will now be required to self-isolate. ""The manager and both players immediately left the stadium and have returned home,"" said a club statement. The club was told of the results ahead of its Carabao Cup tie against Hull City on Tuesday. Pubs, bars and restaurants in Wales must only provide a table service and will have to close at 22:00 from Thursday, the Welsh First Minister has confirmed. In a televised address Mark Drakeford warned: ""In the weeks and months ahead of us, there is a very real possibility we could see coronavirus regain a foothold in our local communities, towns and cities. None of us wants to see that happen again."" He said some parts of south Wales had seen the sharpest rise in cases and were already under strict local measures but said ""we now need to make that difference across Wales"". Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she recognised the latest restrictions may feel like a ""step backwards"", but urged Scots to stick with them, insisting they ""will make a difference"". She said through collective efforts the virus had been beaten back but warned that over winter ""the challenge is once again getting harder"". ""But please know that thanks to all your efforts over the last six months, we are in a much stronger position than in the spring,"" she added. ""Cases are rising but less rapidly than back then."" Analysis Alex ForsythPolitical correspondent While Labour broadly supports the stricter
measures the partyâs criticism centres on two points; the party says the Test
and Trace system isnât working and itâs repeatedly called for more financial
support for sectors that have been adversely affected by restrictions. That
pressureâs growing; including from some on the Tory benches concerned about the
impact of a restricted economy on businesses. For Labour, shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth says the PM should not be ""phasing out"" the furlough scheme, which is due to finish at the end of next month. He tells the BBC preserving public health and the economy does not represent an ""either/or"" choice for the government. Mr Ashworth accuses ministers of ignoring ""all the warnings"" on the coronavirus testing system. Prime Minister Boris Johnson
- in a televised message to the country â reiterated the governmentâs new âtougher
package of measuresâ designed to curb the rise in coronavirus infection. New restrictions for
England are expected to last for the next six months. These include pubs and
restaurants closing from 10pm, the compulsory wearing of face masks and
coverings for shop workers, people advised to work from home âwherever
possibleâ and tougher enforcement of rule-breaking. Thereâs more detail on the new
ruleshere.  Alex ForsythPolitical correspondent Boris
Johnson adopted a similar line to the one he used in Parliament earlier - that of acting now to prevent more onerous restrictions later Both politically and economically, the government is
desperate to avoid another wholesale lockdown and hopes these measures will
help. When he addressed MPs earlier, the PMâs assertion that these new measures might be in
place for six months was stark. Now heâs offering a sprinkling of optimism by
saying things will be better by the spring, but that doesnât mean the country

National Trust details colonialism and slave links,"Glastonbury Tor, in Somerset, which was found to have links to to successful compensation claims as a result of the abolition of slavery The National Trust has revealed how more than 90 of its properties have connections to slavery and colonialism. The links - at 93 properties - are highlighted in a report commissioned by the charity to tell the history of colonialism and slavery at its sites. Some, like Penrhyn Castle in north Wales, show how wealth derived from slavery was used for reconstruction. The charity has said it is committed to sharing the histories of slavery and colonialism. It has also pledged to add to its research, and admitted that it has more work to do. John Orna Orenstein, its director of culture and engagement, said it was about raising awareness. He said: ""Just to be really clear, we're not making judgements about the past, what we're trying to do is reflect as accurately and comprehensively as we can the histories across a variety of places."" The National Trust is a conservation charity in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. There is a separate and independent National Trust for Scotland, Colonialism 'umbilical' at National Trust homes The report details links to plantation owners and those who were paid compensation for enslaved people freed through abolition, as well as those who gained their wealth through the slave trade. It also includes properties with connections to people involved in colonial expansion, including leading figures in the East India Company, or senior figures in administering colonies, including Winston Churchill's home Chartwell. And those with important cultural links to Britain's colonial history, such as writer Rudyard Kipling's home in Sussex, Bateman's, or the home of historian Thomas Carlyle in London are highlighted. The National Trust report shows how estates and stately homes such as Clandon Park, Surrey, and Hare Hall in Cheshire were linked to wealth from plantations or the slave trade. Some 29 properties cared for by the National Trust have links to successful compensation claims as a result of the abolition of slavery, such as Glastonbury Tor in Somerset, and Blickling Hall, Norfolk, the report shows. Quarry Bank Mill, Cheshire, was built using family wealth related to slavery, while Bath Assembly Rooms was connected to the wider colonial and slavery economies of the 18th Century, it highlights. Powis Castle in Wales, with its links to Clive of India, and Cragside, Northumberland, which was home to Sir William Armstrong who supplied guns to British military forces, are among those with imperial links. The survey also documents those National Trust properties belonging to people who were involved in the abolition movement or the fight against colonial oppression. And it highlights the presence of African and Asian people working on English and Welsh estates. The report draws on the trust's own archives and external evidence such as the Legacies of British Slave-ownership project run by University College London. Dr Tarnya Cooper, the National Trust's curatorial and collections director, said a ""significant"" number of the properties in the charity's care have links to the colonisation of different parts of the world, and some to historic slavery. ""Colonialism and slavery were central to the national economy from the 17th to the 19th Centuries,"" she said. She added that it was the charity's job, as a heritage charity, to research, interpret and openly share full and up-to-date information about its properties. ""This report is the fullest account to date of the links between places now in the care of the National Trust and colonialism and historic slavery,"" she said, though she added it was not exhaustive and would be added to as more research was done. The research has been used to update online information and will be used to help the Trust review visitor information and displays at properties.

Amazon slammed for 'Black Lives Don't Matter' caps,"Amazon has since taken down the hats from sale and said sellers must follow their guidelines A barrister has criticised Amazon for selling hats with the slogan ""Black Lives Don't Matter"", marketed as being elegant and a ""nice present"". Alexandra Wilson, from Essex, said it was ""honestly embarrassing"" the company was selling the caps and questioned whether it had any checks in place. Amazon has since removed the hats, which were being sold by a third party. Last week the retailer faced criticism forselling T-shirts with the slogan ""Let's Make Down Syndrome Extinct"". Ms Wilson, 25, who has previously been the subject of racist abuse, said it was ""really disappointing"" it took some time for the hats to be taken down. She said she wanted to make sure the item was never sold again. Alexandra Wilson, who specialises in family and criminal law, reported the item to Amazon ""Multiple people reported it and racist material should be removed immediately,"" she said. ""Websites like Amazon definitely need to have better checks in place for both their descriptions and photos because this isn't the first time something like this has happened."" The hat, which cost Â£12.96, was described by the seller as ""high quality"" with a ""unique and fashionable"" design which was ""eye catching"". It said the hat's ""elegant"" appearance made it a ""nice present"" for family and friends. In a statement, Amazon said: ""All sellers must follow our selling guidelines and those who do not will be subject to action including potential removal of their account.

Johnson 'just not up to the job' - StarmerThe Labour leader says his party has to win back voters' trust as he addresses Labour conference.,"This video can not be played Sir Keir: ""We still have a lot of work to do"" Sir Keir Starmer has told Labour to ""get serious about winning"" in his first conference speech as leader. Sir Keir attacked Boris Johnson's ""serial incompetence"" and said he was ""just not up to the job"" of being PM. But he said Labour had work to do win back voters' trust - and had deserved to lose the 2019 general election. In an online broadcast, he set out his vision for the UK and urged voters to ""take another look at Labour"", adding: ""We are under new leadership."" And he assured voters who deserted the party in droves in some of its traditional heartlands: ""We love this country as you do."" Starmer speech reaction Starmer faces challenges over patriotism call Labour aims to build trust with new slogan A guide to party conferences in a Covid world The speech was delivered to a near-empty room, in Doncaster, South Yorkshire, because of social distancing restrictions, and was greeted with silence instead of the usual applause and ovations. He criticised the government's handling of the coronavirus pandemic and said the crisis had revealed Boris Johnson as being ""just not serious"" and ""not up to the job"". ""It makes me angry that, just when the country needs leadership, we get serial incompetence,"" said the Labour leader. But he said Labour had to be ""brutally honest"" with itself about why had it had lost four general elections in a row. ""When you lose an election in a democracy you deserve to. You don't look at the electorate and ask them: 'what were you thinking?',"" he told the party. He said Labour was ""becoming a competent, credible Opposition but that's not enough"". And he vowed that ""never again will Labour go into an election not being trusted on national security, with your job, with your community and with your money. That's what being under new leadership means."" Keir Starmer literally stood in front of a red wall in Doncaster, and his key message was to those who had abandoned Labour in 2019 - we hear you. He has something of an innovative policy chief in Claire Ainsley - one who doesn't believe in setting out detailed policies. So he was blatant - clever policy offers aren't enough to win trust. Far more important are values. He emphasised the classic Labour values of ""compassion"" and ""opportunity"", but also stressed the importance of family and security - seen as a weak spot for Labour under Jeremy Corbyn. His message to his own party was more brutal than anticipated - suggesting that it would be a ""betrayal"" to be anything other than relentless in seeking power. But he was also brutal towards the prime minister - Starmer was a serious lawyer when Boris Johnson was writing flippant columns. So far, Starmer's focus as Labour leader has been on competence. Polling suggests this has been successful  - but he has been accused of being managerial, even funereal, in his approach. Today he succeeded in injecting passion into a speech in a near empty hall. His ""new leadership"" is ambitious for change, but he was also ""angry"" that he wasn't in power to achieve it. Labour's four-day online event replaced the party's traditional party conference due to be held in Liverpool, which was cancelled due to the Covid-19 pandemic. In his speech, Sir Keir said the policies on which Labour will fight the next election in 2024 ""won't sound like anything you've heard before"". ""It will sound like the future arriving,"" he said of the party's next manifesto. On Brexit, Sir Keir, who campaigned for a second referendum, declared that Labour would not be a party ""that keeps banging on about Europe"". ""Let me absolutely clear,"" he said, ""the debate between Leave and Remain is over."" He called on the prime minister to secure a trade deal with the EU, and said he would be ""failing Britain"" if he failed to achieve one. He also pledged to fight for the Union, saying: ""We must make the case much more persuasively that we achieve more together than we do alone. ""To stop the Nationalists ripping our country apart by design, and to stop the Tories dismantling it by neglect."" Sir Keir replaced Jeremy Corbyn as leader in the contest that followed December's general election, where the party won fewer Commons seats than any election since 1935. The broadcast Sir Keir's first Labour conference speech since becoming leader in April. On the economy, the Labour leader repeated calls for ""properly funded"" public services and ""huge investment"" in skills to create work opportunities. He also called for action to tackle climate change, and for the government to develop a new strategy to close gaps in education inequality. And he pledged to work ""hand-in-hand"" with both the private sector and trade unions in a bid to create ""high quality jobs"". Momentum, the left wing campaign group originally set up to support Jeremy Corbyn's leadership, said Sir Keir's speech was a ""missed opportunity to show substance"". The group's co-chair, and West Midlands regional secretary of the Fire Brigades Union, Andrew Scattergood, said: ""If Starmer wants to appeal to working class voters, his pitch should be based on solidarity with the working class and defending their interests, not just slogans and platitudes."" He accused the Labour leader of being silent on key issues, including Black Lives Matter and the end of the evictions ban in England - and suggested he was ""rowing back"" on promises made during his leadership campaign, such as taxing the ""super rich"". But Nathan Yeowell, director of Progress, which was originally set up to campaign for Blairite values, tweeted: ""It is so refreshing to have a Labour leader who wants to win."" In a message to supporters after the Labour leader's speech, the Conservative Party said: ""Sir Keir Starmer was a key member of Jeremy Corbyn's top team. ""Even now whilst he pretends to be showing 'new leadership' he can't even name a single one of Corbyn's polices he'd drop.""

The party said it opposed the new restrictions being brought in by the Welsh Government. Party leader in the Senedd, Mark Reckless, said: ""We think it would be much better to trust to people's individual judgments, as to their risk and the risk of those they live with, and make their own decisions depending on the evolution of the virus."" Welsh Conservative Member of the Senedd Andrew RT Davies said it
was ""important that, where possible, there is a national message that
people can understand and realise what the obligations that are being placed on
society"". He was speaking after Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford made televised addresses on Tuesday evening to talk
about new restrictions to tackle Covid-19. ""It is collectively working together that will bear down on
this virus, and ultimately defeat it,"" said Mr Davies.  How we all respond to these new measures could play a significant role in whether tighter controls are to follow, the health minister says. Vaughan Gething said further restrictions could be avoided if people follow the guidelines. ""It's about the response from the public,"" he told BBC Wales Today. ""It's disappointing for all of us that these restrictions have to come into place, not just for the traders who are worried about jobs, but for us all and the choices we make. ""If we are going to go to the pub or restaurant, follow the rules of who you are going with. ""If we make choices about our behaviour, we can avoid further restrictions being introduced and further harm from coronavirus."" Felicity EvansBBC Wales political editor These new measures donât change the Wales-wide picture
enormously but they do add to the mosaic building up around the country. There are still much tighter restrictions in local lockdown
areas so thereâs increasing complexity in the rules
and a bigger challenge for politicians and public health officials in
communicating which rules apply where. And while these rules may be
important in tackling the threat of Covid-19, getting a testing system that can
cope with demand and deliver results in a timely and efficient way is also
vital. Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said in local lockdown areas sales of alcohol from off-licences should be restricted from 6pm. He also said the Welsh Government should consider closing pubs indoors or temporarily closing down pubs that do not serve food. Mr Price said these steps should be backed up by âsector-specific financial support to affected businessesâ. âIn areas of increased restrictions, we should go further than simply closing pubs at 10pm,"" he said. ""In those areas, we should also restrict the sales of alcohol from off licences at 6pm and either close pubs indoors completely or close pubs that donât serve food like theyâve done in Ireland.""  Health Minister Vaughan Gething says many people do not fully understand rules over how people from different homes can meet. ""A lot of people don't understand the rules about extended households,"" he told BBC Wales Today. ""It's about you and three other households, making four in total, who agree you can only see each other and only enter each other's homes. ""And if you go out, say to the pub, you only sit at tables with people from those households."" He added that the new measures were aimed at minimising contact which is ""driving"" the rise in transmission rates. ""It's about considering whether you really need to make that journey.""

In his broadcast address, First Minister Mark Drakeford called for people to avoid unnecessary travel. Sales of alcohol from off-licences and supermarkets after 10pm will also be stopped. Pubs will be required to provide table service only. However Mr Drakeford, in the recorded statement, offered Â£500 to people on low-income who are forced to self-isolate.

UK bank may have moved 'terrorism-linked money',"Standard Chartered issued a Suspicious Activity Report in 2016 A British bank moved money that may have been linked to terrorist financing, leaked documents show. Standard Chartered Bank processed almost $12m (Â£9.4m) in payments for Jordan's Arab Bank from 2014 to 2016. In 2016, Standard Chartered filed a report alerting authorities to more than 900 transactions that it suspected might have been for ""illicit activities under the guise of charity"". The report raised concerns about ""possible terrorist financing"". The payments were reviewed after a US jury in 2014 found Arab Bank had knowingly provided banking services to the Palestinian militant group Hamas in the early 2000s. The verdict was later overturned, but in 2015 the bank reached a settlement with 597 victims or the relatives of victims of 22 Hamas attacks in Israel. In response to the leaked documents, Arab Bank stated that it ""abhors terrorism and does not support or encourage terrorist activities"". Arab Bank said it was never notified by Standard Chartered that it had any concerns over transactions processed for its customers. Standard Chartered said it took its responsibility to fight financial crime extremely seriously. The leaked documents - known as the FinCEN files - were shared by BuzzFeed News with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) and BBC News Arabic. All you need to know about FinCEN documents leak Your guide to eight years of finance leaks Arab Bank is one of the world's largest Arab banking networks, with 600 branches spread across five continents. In 2015 it agreed to a settlement with the victims and relatives of Hamas attacks carried out in Israel between 2001 and 2004. Arab Bank says it ""does not support or encourage terrorist activities"" The previous year, a US civil jury found that Arab Bank had knowingly provided banking services to leaders of the Palestinian militant group Hamas and charities it controlled. This verdict was later overturned as the judge had incorrectly instructed the jury. The 10-year legal case produced evidence that Hamas had used the bank to move money and pay the families of suicide bombers in the early 2000s. Gary Osen, a US lawyer who represented the victims in the US lawsuit against Arab Bank, told the BBC: ""A terrorist organisationâ¦ can't move the kind of money that an organisation like Hamas needs to operate. You need banking services, and Arab Bank was simply the largest and most convenient route."" Hamas is regarded as a terrorist group by the US, Israel, the EU and several other nations due to its long record of attacks and its refusal to renounce violence. In 2005, after an investigation by US regulators, Arab Bank was no longer authorised to process US dollar payments. It was also fined $24m for failing to adequately guard against money laundering and terrorist financing, and properly report suspicious activities. Banks across the world rely on major Western banks like Standard Chartered to help them move money in US dollars. The service is known as correspondent banking. The FinCEN files show that Standard Chartered began an investigation into US dollar payments that it had processed for Arab Bank after the 2014 trial. Arab Bank was sued by American relatives of victims of attacks by Hamas In early 2016, Standard Chartered issued a Suspicious Activity Report (SAR), which alerts authorities to potential instances of criminal activity, such as money laundering or terrorist financing. The SAR highlighted more than 900 payments that Standard Chartered believed might have been for ""illicit activities under the guise of charity"". The payments were labelled as ""charities"", ""donations"", ""support"" or ""gifts"", but ""a large majority"" of them were made ""by individuals who could not be verified in the public domain"", according to Standard Chartered's review. Other payments triggered ""terrorism"" alerts. Some appeared to be intended for ""Specially Designated Nationals"" who were under US sanctions. According to the SAR, the suspicious payments prompted Standard Chartered's New York branch to ""[exit] its relationship"" with Arab Bank in 2016. Arab Bank said: ""In every country where it operates, Arab Bank is in good standing with government regulators and complies with anti-terrorism and money laundering laws. No government or regulator has ever found that accounts or transactions processed by Arab Bank violated anti-terrorism laws."" It said many of the allegations ""date back nearly 20 years"", and that the vast majority of the accounts involved had no known terrorist links at the time. Arab Bank added that it had never been notified by Standard Chartered that it had any concerns over transactions it processed for Arab Bank customers. Although Standard Chartered stopped processing US dollar payments for Arab Bank, it continued to maintain a very good business relationship with Standard Chartered, it said. Standard Chartered said it ""initiated account closure"" with Arab Bank shortly after the 2014 court verdict but that it was a process that took some time. It also said an SAR ""is not an admission of fault on the part of the bank, nor is it conclusive evidence that wrongdoing has taken place"". ""Only the proper authorities are in a position to make that determination."" It added that it took its ""responsibility to fight financial crime extremely seriously"" and that it had ""invested substantially in compliance programmes"". It had ""nearly 2,000 staff"" monitoring suspicious transactions, who last year ""monitored more than 1.2 billion transactions for potential suspicious activity"". The FinCen Files is a leak of secret documents which reveal how major banks have allowed dirty money to be moved around the world. They also show how the UK is often the weak link in the financial system and how London is awash with Russian cash. The files were obtained by BuzzFeed News which shared them with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) and 400 journalists around the world.

Pubs in England to close at 10pm amid Covid spread,"All pubs, bars, restaurants and other hospitality venues in England must have a 22:00 closing time from Thursday, to help curb the spread of coronavirus. The sector will also be restricted by law to table service only. Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove said people should also work from home ""if they can"" andtrials of spectators at sports fixtures would be ""paused"". The full measures will be set out by the prime minister in the House of Commons later. Boris Johnson will also address the nation in a live broadcast at 20:00 BST on Tuesday. It comes asthe UK's Covid-19 alert level moved to 4, meaning transmission is ""high or rising exponentially"". Mr Gove told BBC Breakfast that there was evidence the 22:00 closing time has a ""beneficial effect"" on the spread of the virus in areas where the restriction has already been tried. How does the Covid-19 alert level system work? How many cases are there in your area? He denied the government was wrong to relax coronavirus measures against the virus in the summer, describing the new restrictions as a ""recalibration which we hope and believe will be enough to check the spread"". ""We're not going back to the sorts of measures that we had in the spring,"" he said. ""If people can work from home they should"", he added. ""But I stress that it's very important that those people whose jobs require them to be in a specific workplace do so."" Mr Gove said plans for sport with live audiences to return from 1 October were being halted ""for the moment"" because of the risk of fans mixing on the way to the stadium or during half-time. The government's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance haswarned there could be 50,000 new coronavirus cases a day by mid-Octoberwithout further action - which, he said, could lead to more than 200 deaths per day by mid-November. Prof Calum Semple, an expert in outbreak medicine at the University of Liverpool, told BBC Breakfast current data was ""tracking the worst-case scenario quite accurately"". He said there was now a rise in hospital admissions, including among women aged 20 to 40, who were at risk of exposure to the virus because of their work in hospitality, caring roles or because they were parents of schoolchildren. The UK needed ""quite a lot more"" restrictions in place to prevent the spread, and the hospitality industry will probably have to take another ""hit"", Prof Semple said. Andy Wood, chief executive of the Adnams brewery, told the Today programme that the pub industry had taken health messages seriously and it seemed ""incongruous"" to be singled out. He said the industry was still ""on life support"" with about 900,000 jobs at risk. On Monday, a further 4,368 daily cases and 11 deaths were reported in the UK. Also: Further restrictions will also be announcedin Scotlandon Tuesday Restrictions on households mixing indoorswill be extended to all of Northern Ireland Also from 18:00 on Tuesday,four more counties in south Wales will face new measures, including a 23:00 curfew for pubs and bars New measureswill also come into force in Lancashire, Merseyside, parts of the Midlands and West Yorkshirefrom Tuesday. Other areas of England, Scotland and Wales are already underlocal lockdown, with restrictions including a ban on mixing with other households. People are understandably asking what difference closing at 22:00 makes. Coupled with the table service law, it will be little more than a marginal gain. But what ministers hope is that the move, along with the rule of six, will act as a warning to the public that efforts to curb the virus need to be redoubled. What remains to be seen is whether any other restrictions will accompany this move. It seems inevitable that the virus will continue to spread - that's what respiratory viruses do during winter, especially one for which there is limited immunity and no vaccine. But how quickly and widely - no one knows. The risk of trying to suppress the virus is the government will soon find itself having to make another decision about further steps. How far are ministers prepared to go? Every restriction that is taken has a negative consequence to society. But the nature of the virus means lives will undoubtedly be lost the more it spreads. Balancing those two harms will define the next six months. The cabinet will meet on Tuesday morning and Boris Johnson will also chair a Cobra emergency meeting - which will be attended by the first ministers of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Speaking about the new closing times, a No 10 spokesperson said: ""We know this won't be easy, but we must take further action to control the resurgence in cases of the virus and protect the NHS."" Tighter restrictions on pub and restaurant opening times are already in place in parts of north-east and north-west England, and Wales. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey described the new rules as ""a step backwards"", as he urged the government to fix the test and trace system and help the hospitality sector. ""After people have already been through so much hardship, we cannot allow thousands of jobs to disappear overnight,"" he said. There were also calls for support from within the hospitality sector. Kate Nicholls, chief executive of trade body UKHospitality, said the new rules should be ""applied with flexibility"", and that a 22:00 closing time was ""bad for business and bad for controlling the virus"". She added: ""Table service has been widely adopted in some parts of the sector since reopening, but it is not necessary across all businesses, such as coffee shops."" Meanwhile, Michael Kill, chief executive of the Night-Time Industries Association, warned the move would result in a ""surge of unregulated events and house parties"". If Boris Johnson had decreed a year ago that he was going to call last orders on the pub at 22:00, the ravens might have left the Tower. But given the terrible warnings from the government's top scientists on Monday, thekind of strict measures that ministers had been discussing- and the extent of restrictions that many people are already living with in some of our towns and cities - you might wonder if what the prime minister has ended up deciding is less stringent than it might have been. As we have talked about many times, Downing Street is all too aware of the economic havoc the restrictions around the pandemic have caused. Logically, therefore, it has always only wanted to take action when it has felt absolutely urgent. It is also the case that, as we enter a second surge, more is understood about the virus itself. That means the government ought to be able to take a more sophisticated approach to managing the spread, rather than blunt, blunderbuss nationwide measures. At least for now, the prime minister has concluded there is a narrow, but real chance to put the brakes on the outbreak before taking more draconian steps. Read more from Laura. It comes as Christopher Snowdon, head of lifestyle economics at free-market think tank the Institute of Economic Affairs, said the latest restrictions seemed ""to have emerged from a random policy generator"" as he called on the government to publish the evidence upon which it was based. ""While mandatory table service has been part of the successful Swedish approach and may have merit, the new closing time will be devastating to a hospitality sector that was already suffering after the first lockdown,"" he said. The prime minister's announcement on closing times comes after a series of meetings over the weekend, including with the government's chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty, Chancellor Rishi Sunak and Health Secretary Matt Hancock.

At least 90 whales dead in stranding off Australia,"Trained rescuers are helping move the whales into deeper waters At least a third of 270 whales stranded off Tasmania have died and more are feared to be dying, rescuers in Australia say. However, crews were able to save 25 of the animals on Tuesday and are aiming to escort more back into the sea. The pilot whales were discovered in shallow waters off the west coast of the island on Monday. It's unknown what drew the whales to the shore. Marine biologists say the rescue mission will likely take days. Whale beachings are common in the region, but one of this size has not been seen in over a decade. Tasmania last recorded a mass stranding in 2009 involving around 200 whales. Rescuers from the Tasmanian Marine Conservation Program arrived late on Monday and found three groups of whales across Macquarie Heads - a remote tip of the island with limited vessel and road access. About 200 of the mammals had washed up on a sandbar near a boat ramp, while 30 others were found several hundred metres away. Another 30 were found further inland along Ocean Beach. Many of the whales are in ""relatively inaccessible"" locations, posing a challenge for rescuers. However some of the whales closer to deeper waters have been successfully guided out. A team of about 40 trained rescuers began to ""re-float"" a small number of whales on Tuesday morning - using equipment to push the animals off a sandbar into deeper waters. ""Normally we're dealing with animals high and dry on the beach. This is different. We've got animals semi-buoyant so it probably won't take too much to re-float them - just involves a bit of grunt,"" said wildlife biologist Dr Kris Carlyon. Once the whales are doing well in the water, the next step is to get them further out. Dr Carlyon told reporters this could be a challenge against the strong tide. Boats might be used to help the manoeuvre. He added many of the animals may simply be too big or in an unsuitable location. Pilot whales can grow up to seven metres long and weigh up to three tonnes. This video can not be played 'We don't know how this is going to pan out': Hundreds of whales stranded off the coast of Tasmania ""We will take the animals with the best chance to start with,"" said Dr Carlyon. He said rescuers knew from previous missions that pilot whales can survive three or four days being beached, and many in this group were in good ""wet and cool"" conditions. A full assessment of the group was due later on Tuesday. Officials have urged the public to stay away from the scene, saying they have enough helpers. The reason is often simply unknown, scientists say. Around Australia and New Zealand different kinds of whales make seasonal migrations every year in pods as large as a 1,000 animals. Some of the whales have washed up onto a beach Researchers say they follow a leader and their strong social bonds can lead to whole groups beaching themselves. ""It might have been a single misadventure by one or two of them and because pilot whales are such a social species, that may have drawn the other animals in,"" Dr Carlyon said. In New Zealand in 2018, more than 200 pilot whales died over the course of a week in separate strandings off the nation's east coast. Why did so many whales wash up in New Zealand?

LiveLiveUK's PM to address MPs on new restrictions1 minute ago1 minute ago Welcome back to our live coverageWelcome back to our live coverageLive UK's PM to address MPs on new restrictions  1 minute ago,"PM Boris Johnson says coronavirus rules could be even further tightened In a TV address he said there had been too many breaches He called on the British public to 'get through the winter together' Pubs, bars and restaurants must close at 22:00 from Thursday in England and Wales, and from Friday in Scotland Different households not allowed to meet indoors in Scotland from Friday, the first minister says Children under 12 in Scotland are to be exempt from all outdoor household meeting limits The US coronavirus death toll has passed 200,000, Johns Hopkins University says Cases in Mexico surpass 700,000 - Latin America is the worst hit region Over 31.2 million Covid-19 cases are confirmed worldwide, with more than 960,000 deaths Martha Buckley That's all for our live coverage today. Join us again tomorrow for more of the latest news on coronavirus as it happens. Today's contributors were Sean Fanning, Chris Clayton, Martha Buckley, Marie Jackson, Georgina Rannard, Doug Faulkner, Jennifer Scott, Penny Spiller, Paul Seddon and Justin Parkinson. If you are just joining us, or have been overwhelmed by the number of announcements, here are some of today's headlines from around the UK:  Thank you for following our coverage
of the coronavirus pandemic. Hereâs a quick reminder of the major stories from around
the world: Among today's announcements is the introduction of a 10pm closing time for the hospitality industry, as well as a table service-only rule. The news has been greeted with concern by businesses in the sector. Tom Stainer, chief executive of the Campaign for Real Ale, said pub customers and publicans wanted to stop the spread of the virus but said the government hadn't shown the evidence that pubs were disproportionately contributing to increased infections. ""It is additional pressure on already fragile pubs which are at real risk of closure,"" he said, pointing out there was currently no support on offer from the government. Mr Stainer added the curfew would cut into several hours of ""high trading times"" at a time when the industry needed to pay off debts after the lockdown. Andy Lennox, founder of Zim Braai restaurants, said his business had lost 30% of its revenue ""overnight"" with the 10pm closing time and it was going to be ""very difficult"". ""The big thing now is what the support going to be, we need some kind of more flexi-furlough brought in that will allow us to add new employees to that, the VAT needs to stay - that 5% is massive,"" he said. Mr Lennox added that Eat Out To Help Out had helped in August - but had only made back losses the industry had already suffered. There have been national protests calling for more protective equipment for health workers The US Congress approved a whopping $3tn emergency funding to fight the coronavirus pandemic back in March. But could it be that some of the money did not go to where it was intended? That is the claim in a Washington Post report, which says $1bn earmarked for the US Defence Department to boost a shortage of medical supplies instead went on patching up gaps in military equipment procurement for items such as jet engines, body armour and uniforms. Some defence contractors, the Washington Post goes on to say, had already tapped into other bail-out measures, such as the job-protection scheme. Analysts say officials are struggling to account for some of the Congress-approved funds. There has been no response yet from the Pentagon. You can read the story in the Washington Posthere,external.  Northern Ireland's First Minister Arlene Foster has described new restrictions in the nation asa ""wake-up call"". She said the ""tough"" new measures, which include banning different households from mixing indoors, were not a second lockdown, while Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neil called for a big push to curb the rise in cases during a joint televised address. Mrs Foster said the actions being taken were ""designed to prevent the need for a return to lockdown"". ""We have risen to the challenge many times before,"" she said. Ms O'Neill said: ""The choices you make could be the difference between life and death for those closest to you."" The new measures came into effect at 18:00. The government has published its updated guidance for coronavirus measure in England, following Boris Johnson's televised address. Here are some the changes: Read the updated guidancehere,external. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey says the PM ""must
take responsibility for what has gone wrong"" with ""his 'world-beating' test-and-trace system"". He calls it ""inexcusable"" that this has been ""overwhelmed"" in recent weeks. West Ham United manager David Moyes and two of his players have tested positive for coronavirus,the club has said. Moyes, 57, defender Issa Diop, 23, and 24-year-old midfielder Josh Cullen will now be required to self-isolate. ""The manager and both players immediately left the stadium and have returned home,"" said a club statement. The club was told of the results ahead of its Carabao Cup tie against Hull City on Tuesday. Pubs, bars and restaurants in Wales must only provide a table service and will have to close at 22:00 from Thursday, the Welsh First Minister has confirmed. In a televised address Mark Drakeford warned: ""In the weeks and months ahead of us, there is a very real possibility we could see coronavirus regain a foothold in our local communities, towns and cities. None of us wants to see that happen again."" He said some parts of south Wales had seen the sharpest rise in cases and were already under strict local measures but said ""we now need to make that difference across Wales"". Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she recognised the latest restrictions may feel like a ""step backwards"", but urged Scots to stick with them, insisting they ""will make a difference"". She said through collective efforts the virus had been beaten back but warned that over winter ""the challenge is once again getting harder"". ""But please know that thanks to all your efforts over the last six months, we are in a much stronger position than in the spring,"" she added. ""Cases are rising but less rapidly than back then."" Analysis Alex ForsythPolitical correspondent While Labour broadly supports the stricter
measures the partyâs criticism centres on two points; the party says the Test
and Trace system isnât working and itâs repeatedly called for more financial
support for sectors that have been adversely affected by restrictions. That
pressureâs growing; including from some on the Tory benches concerned about the
impact of a restricted economy on businesses. For Labour, shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth says the PM should not be ""phasing out"" the furlough scheme, which is due to finish at the end of next month. He tells the BBC preserving public health and the economy does not represent an ""either/or"" choice for the government. Mr Ashworth accuses ministers of ignoring ""all the warnings"" on the coronavirus testing system. Prime Minister Boris Johnson
- in a televised message to the country â reiterated the governmentâs new âtougher
package of measuresâ designed to curb the rise in coronavirus infection. New restrictions for
England are expected to last for the next six months. These include pubs and
restaurants closing from 10pm, the compulsory wearing of face masks and
coverings for shop workers, people advised to work from home âwherever
possibleâ and tougher enforcement of rule-breaking. Thereâs more detail on the new
ruleshere.  Alex ForsythPolitical correspondent Boris
Johnson adopted a similar line to the one he used in Parliament earlier - that of acting now to prevent more onerous restrictions later Both politically and economically, the government is
desperate to avoid another wholesale lockdown and hopes these measures will
help. When he addressed MPs earlier, the PMâs assertion that these new measures might be in
place for six months was stark. Now heâs offering a sprinkling of optimism by
saying things will be better by the spring, but that doesnât mean the country
isnât in for a few tough and uncertain months. Alex ForsythPolitical correspondent Some have suggested the government should
allow people to take more personal risk. Yesterday, the Chief Medical Officer for England, Chris Whitty, said increasing the risk for individuals increased the risk for everyone. Now, Boris Johnson is echoing that refrain, saying ""these risks are not our own"" - with Downing Street pushing a sense of national unity and resolve. The PM tells the UK population: ""Never in our history has our collective destiny and our
collective health depended so completely on our individual behaviour."" There will be ""great days ahead"", he predicts, calling for ""discipline"", ""resolve"" and a ""spirit of togetherness that will carry us through"". That ends Boris Johnson's address. Alex ForsythPolitical correspondent The prime minister says this approach carries the support of the main parliamentary
parties, but itâs not without question. Thereâs still tension in the Conservative party
about whether today's measures go far enough, or indeed too far, and what role Parliament
should have in scrutinising them and signing them off. And Labour is among the opposition voices
calling for more financial support for affected sectors and improvements to the
testing system. This video can not be played Coronavirus: PM says health depends on âindividual behaviourâ Boris Johnson says bringing in extra restrictions now will keep shops and schools open. Meanwhile, the NHS is ""better prepared"" than it was when the pandemic first hit the UK, with personal protective equipment, extra beds and Nightingale hospitals in place, he adds. Doctors and medical advisers are ""rightly worried"" at the moment, the prime minister says, but they are ""unanimous that things will be far better
by the spring"", with the ""hope"" of a vaccine by then and more efficient mass testing. That is the ""hope"" and the ""dream"", he adds. Boris Johnson says he's ""deeply, spiritually reluctant"" to curb civil liberties, but the virus can't be allowed to get out of control or NHS patients with ""non-Covid needs"" will suffer. Another lockdown would threaten jobs and ""the loving human contact"" on which we all depend"", he adds. Education would suffer and loneliness would grow, the PM argues. Alex ForsythPolitical correspondent It goes without saying the prime minister only addresses the
nation when No 10 thinks itâs needed. It is a sign of the extraordinary and
difficult year it's been that this may feel familiar now to some people at home. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
"Sports bodies warn Covid could cause 'lost generation'More than 100 sports bodies write to the prime minister to ask for emergency funding amid the Covid-19 crisis, warning of ""a lost generation of activity"".BBC Sport","Plans for spectators to be allowed to return to stadiums and venues was placed under review earlier this month after a rise in Covid-19 cases The leaders of more than 100 sports bodies have written to Prime Minister Boris Johnson to ask for emergency funding, warning of ""a lost generation of activity"" because of coronavirus. The coalition of organisations says they are ""united in our concern that at a time when our role should be central to the nation's recovery, the future of the sector is perilous"". In a letter seen by BBC Sport, the group urges the government to provide a ""sports recovery fund"" so the sector can ""survive and stabilise"". The governmentannounced on Tuesdaythat plans for spectators to be allowed to return to stadiums and venues from 1 October will not go ahead. The letter written by the organisations, which include the Football Association, Premier League, Rugby Football Union, England and Wales Cricket Board and Lawn Tennis Association, adds: ""We require a comprehensive support package for the sport and physical sector to aid its recovery. ""This package must combine investment, tax incentives, and regulatory reform. ""Covid-19 has undermined our commercial revenue streams with both stadiums and leisure facilities closed or greatly reduced in capacity. ""The impact of this will potentially lead to a lost generation of sport and activity. ""We are particularly concerned about the impact on those whose participation has been limited during the pandemic. Physical activity levels, especially in the most vulnerable groups, are significantly below where they were tracking pre-Covid-19."" The arts industry was given a Â£1.57bn support package by the government in July. Although Sport England has handed out Â£200m for emergency cases, many in the sector believe more is needed. A series of sports bodies have announced job losses in recent weeks and warned they face major mounting losses if turnstiles are not opened soon. The government is to ask sports bodies to assess the financial impact of several more months without paying spectators, and is understood to be preparing to work with organisations on what support might be needed to help them survive. In the letter, the prime minister is told that sport and physical activity contributes more than Â£16bn and 600,000 jobs to the UK economy. ""Our sector will be at the forefront of your plans to improve the health and wellbeing of all communitiesâ¦to solving societal issuesâ¦including reducing health inequalities, tackling obesity, cutting crime, easing loneliness, and enhancing social cohesion,"" the group adds. ""But to do so effectively, we require your government's backing."" Lisa Wainwight, chief executive of the Sport and Recreation Alliance, said: ""The strength of this coalition from the sports, recreation and activity sector cannot be ignored in its public call to the prime minister. ""The pandemic has put an incredible strain on our sector, which was forced to close for a prolonged period. ""It is imperative that our sector gets the support it requires from the government to get back to business, in order to ease the pressures on the NHS and play a central role in our nation's recovery."" Swim England has reported that 22% of public pools remain closed and all those that are open have reduced capacity. Some 36% of clubs remain without access to pools. Industry bodies Community Leisure UK and UK Active estimate leisure centres, swimming pools and community services face a shortfall of more than Â£800m this year. Former sports minister Tracey Crouch added: ""This isn't just about the number of people on a pitch, field, court or in a pool or gym. ""This is about the whole ecosystem that supports sport, fitness and leisure and, if we're not careful, historic clubs and the jobs that support them will be lost, potentially for good. If government is going to shut sport down then it needs to provide a package of support to stop its decimation."" Tricky Podcast:Has cancel culture gone too far?

LiveLiveUK's PM to address MPs on new restrictions1 minute ago,"PM Boris Johnson says coronavirus rules could be even further tightened In a TV address he said there had been too many breaches He called on the British public to 'get through the winter together' Pubs, bars and restaurants must close at 22:00 from Thursday in England and Wales, and from Friday in Scotland Different households not allowed to meet indoors in Scotland from Friday, the first minister says Children under 12 in Scotland are to be exempt from all outdoor household meeting limits The US coronavirus death toll has passed 200,000, Johns Hopkins University says Cases in Mexico surpass 700,000 - Latin America is the worst hit region Over 31.2 million Covid-19 cases are confirmed worldwide, with more than 960,000 deaths Martha Buckley That's all for our live coverage today. Join us again tomorrow for more of the latest news on coronavirus as it happens. Today's contributors were Sean Fanning, Chris Clayton, Martha Buckley, Marie Jackson, Georgina Rannard, Doug Faulkner, Jennifer Scott, Penny Spiller, Paul Seddon and Justin Parkinson. If you are just joining us, or have been overwhelmed by the number of announcements, here are some of today's headlines from around the UK:  Thank you for following our coverage
of the coronavirus pandemic. Hereâs a quick reminder of the major stories from around
the world: Among today's announcements is the introduction of a 10pm closing time for the hospitality industry, as well as a table service-only rule. The news has been greeted with concern by businesses in the sector. Tom Stainer, chief executive of the Campaign for Real Ale, said pub customers and publicans wanted to stop the spread of the virus but said the government hadn't shown the evidence that pubs were disproportionately contributing to increased infections. ""It is additional pressure on already fragile pubs which are at real risk of closure,"" he said, pointing out there was currently no support on offer from the government. Mr Stainer added the curfew would cut into several hours of ""high trading times"" at a time when the industry needed to pay off debts after the lockdown. Andy Lennox, founder of Zim Braai restaurants, said his business had lost 30% of its revenue ""overnight"" with the 10pm closing time and it was going to be ""very difficult"". ""The big thing now is what the support going to be, we need some kind of more flexi-furlough brought in that will allow us to add new employees to that, the VAT needs to stay - that 5% is massive,"" he said. Mr Lennox added that Eat Out To Help Out had helped in August - but had only made back losses the industry had already suffered. There have been national protests calling for more protective equipment for health workers The US Congress approved a whopping $3tn emergency funding to fight the coronavirus pandemic back in March. But could it be that some of the money did not go to where it was intended? That is the claim in a Washington Post report, which says $1bn earmarked for the US Defence Department to boost a shortage of medical supplies instead went on patching up gaps in military equipment procurement for items such as jet engines, body armour and uniforms. Some defence contractors, the Washington Post goes on to say, had already tapped into other bail-out measures, such as the job-protection scheme. Analysts say officials are struggling to account for some of the Congress-approved funds. There has been no response yet from the Pentagon. You can read the story in the Washington Posthere,external.  Northern Ireland's First Minister Arlene Foster has described new restrictions in the nation asa ""wake-up call"". She said the ""tough"" new measures, which include banning different households from mixing indoors, were not a second lockdown, while Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neil called for a big push to curb the rise in cases during a joint televised address. Mrs Foster said the actions being taken were ""designed to prevent the need for a return to lockdown"". ""We have risen to the challenge many times before,"" she said. Ms O'Neill said: ""The choices you make could be the difference between life and death for those closest to you."" The new measures came into effect at 18:00. The government has published its updated guidance for coronavirus measure in England, following Boris Johnson's televised address. Here are some the changes: Read the updated guidancehere,external. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey says the PM ""must
take responsibility for what has gone wrong"" with ""his 'world-beating' test-and-trace system"". He calls it ""inexcusable"" that this has been ""overwhelmed"" in recent weeks. West Ham United manager David Moyes and two of his players have tested positive for coronavirus,the club has said. Moyes, 57, defender Issa Diop, 23, and 24-year-old midfielder Josh Cullen will now be required to self-isolate. ""The manager and both players immediately left the stadium and have returned home,"" said a club statement. The club was told of the results ahead of its Carabao Cup tie against Hull City on Tuesday. Pubs, bars and restaurants in Wales must only provide a table service and will have to close at 22:00 from Thursday, the Welsh First Minister has confirmed. In a televised address Mark Drakeford warned: ""In the weeks and months ahead of us, there is a very real possibility we could see coronavirus regain a foothold in our local communities, towns and cities. None of us wants to see that happen again."" He said some parts of south Wales had seen the sharpest rise in cases and were already under strict local measures but said ""we now need to make that difference across Wales"". Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she recognised the latest restrictions may feel like a ""step backwards"", but urged Scots to stick with them, insisting they ""will make a difference"". She said through collective efforts the virus had been beaten back but warned that over winter ""the challenge is once again getting harder"". ""But please know that thanks to all your efforts over the last six months, we are in a much stronger position than in the spring,"" she added. ""Cases are rising but less rapidly than back then."" Analysis Alex ForsythPolitical correspondent While Labour broadly supports the stricter
measures the partyâs criticism centres on two points; the party says the Test
and Trace system isnât working and itâs repeatedly called for more financial
support for sectors that have been adversely affected by restrictions. That
pressureâs growing; including from some on the Tory benches concerned about the
impact of a restricted economy on businesses. For Labour, shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth says the PM should not be ""phasing out"" the furlough scheme, which is due to finish at the end of next month. He tells the BBC preserving public health and the economy does not represent an ""either/or"" choice for the government. Mr Ashworth accuses ministers of ignoring ""all the warnings"" on the coronavirus testing system. Prime Minister Boris Johnson
- in a televised message to the country â reiterated the governmentâs new âtougher
package of measuresâ designed to curb the rise in coronavirus infection. New restrictions for
England are expected to last for the next six months. These include pubs and
restaurants closing from 10pm, the compulsory wearing of face masks and
coverings for shop workers, people advised to work from home âwherever
possibleâ and tougher enforcement of rule-breaking. Thereâs more detail on the new
ruleshere.  Alex ForsythPolitical correspondent Boris
Johnson adopted a similar line to the one he used in Parliament earlier - that of acting now to prevent more onerous restrictions later Both politically and economically, the government is
desperate to avoid another wholesale lockdown and hopes these measures will
help. When he addressed MPs earlier, the PMâs assertion that these new measures might be in
place for six months was stark. Now heâs offering a sprinkling of optimism by
saying things will be better by the spring, but that doesnât mean the country
isnât in for a few tough and uncertain months. Alex ForsythPolitical correspondent Some have suggested the government should
allow people to take more personal risk. Yesterday, the Chief Medical Officer for England, Chris Whitty, said increasing the risk for individuals increased the risk for everyone. Now, Boris Johnson is echoing that refrain, saying ""these risks are not our own"" - with Downing Street pushing a sense of national unity and resolve. The PM tells the UK population: ""Never in our history has our collective destiny and our
collective health depended so completely on our individual behaviour."" There will be ""great days ahead"", he predicts, calling for ""discipline"", ""resolve"" and a ""spirit of togetherness that will carry us through"". That ends Boris Johnson's address. Alex ForsythPolitical correspondent The prime minister says this approach carries the support of the main parliamentary
parties, but itâs not without question. Thereâs still tension in the Conservative party
about whether today's measures go far enough, or indeed too far, and what role Parliament
should have in scrutinising them and signing them off. And Labour is among the opposition voices
calling for more financial support for affected sectors and improvements to the
testing system. This video can not be played Coronavirus: PM says health depends on âindividual behaviourâ Boris Johnson says bringing in extra restrictions now will keep shops and schools open. Meanwhile, the NHS is ""better prepared"" than it was when the pandemic first hit the UK, with personal protective equipment, extra beds and Nightingale hospitals in place, he adds. Doctors and medical advisers are ""rightly worried"" at the moment, the prime minister says, but they are ""unanimous that things will be far better
by the spring"", with the ""hope"" of a vaccine by then and more efficient mass testing. That is the ""hope"" and the ""dream"", he adds. Boris Johnson says he's ""deeply, spiritually reluctant"" to curb civil liberties, but the virus can't be allowed to get out of control or NHS patients with ""non-Covid needs"" will suffer. Another lockdown would threaten jobs and ""the loving human contact"" on which we all depend"", he adds. Education would suffer and loneliness would grow, the PM argues. Alex ForsythPolitical correspondent It goes without saying the prime minister only addresses the
nation when No 10 thinks itâs needed. It is a sign of the extraordinary and
difficult year it's been that this may feel familiar now to some people at home. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Sports bodies warn Covid could cause 'lost generation',"Plans for spectators to be allowed to return to stadiums and venues was placed under review earlier this month after a rise in Covid-19 cases The leaders of more than 100 sports bodies have written to Prime Minister Boris Johnson to ask for emergency funding, warning of ""a lost generation of activity"" because of coronavirus. The coalition of organisations says they are ""united in our concern that at a time when our role should be central to the nation's recovery, the future of the sector is perilous"". In a letter seen by BBC Sport, the group urges the government to provide a ""sports recovery fund"" so the sector can ""survive and stabilise"". The governmentannounced on Tuesdaythat plans for spectators to be allowed to return to stadiums and venues from 1 October will not go ahead. The letter written by the organisations, which include the Football Association, Premier League, Rugby Football Union, England and Wales Cricket Board and Lawn Tennis Association, adds: ""We require a comprehensive support package for the sport and physical sector to aid its recovery. ""This package must combine investment, tax incentives, and regulatory reform. ""Covid-19 has undermined our commercial revenue streams with both stadiums and leisure facilities closed or greatly reduced in capacity. ""The impact of this will potentially lead to a lost generation of sport and activity. ""We are particularly concerned about the impact on those whose participation has been limited during the pandemic. Physical activity levels, especially in the most vulnerable groups, are significantly below where they were tracking pre-Covid-19."" The arts industry was given a Â£1.57bn support package by the government in July. Although Sport England has handed out Â£200m for emergency cases, many in the sector believe more is needed. A series of sports bodies have announced job losses in recent weeks and warned they face major mounting losses if turnstiles are not opened soon. The government is to ask sports bodies to assess the financial impact of several more months without paying spectators, and is understood to be preparing to work with organisations on what support might be needed to help them survive. In the letter, the prime minister is told that sport and physical activity contributes more than Â£16bn and 600,000 jobs to the UK economy. ""Our sector will be at the forefront of your plans to improve the health and wellbeing of all communitiesâ¦to solving societal issuesâ¦including reducing health inequalities, tackling obesity, cutting crime, easing loneliness, and enhancing social cohesion,"" the group adds. ""But to do so effectively, we require your government's backing."" Lisa Wainwight, chief executive of the Sport and Recreation Alliance, said: ""The strength of this coalition from the sports, recreation and activity sector cannot be ignored in its public call to the prime minister. ""The pandemic has put an incredible strain on our sector, which was forced to close for a prolonged period. ""It is imperative that our sector gets the support it requires from the government to get back to business, in order to ease the pressures on the NHS and play a central role in our nation's recovery."" Swim England has reported that 22% of public pools remain closed and all those that are open have reduced capacity. Some 36% of clubs remain without access to pools. Industry bodies Community Leisure UK and UK Active estimate leisure centres, swimming pools and community services face a shortfall of more than Â£800m this year. Former sports minister Tracey Crouch added: ""This isn't just about the number of people on a pitch, field, court or in a pool or gym. ""This is about the whole ecosystem that supports sport, fitness and leisure and, if we're not careful, historic clubs and the jobs that support them will be lost, potentially for good. If government is going to shut sport down then it needs to provide a package of support to stop its decimation."" Tricky Podcast:Has cancel culture gone too far?

First minister to announce new restrictions,"This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon announces extension of ban on meeting in houses A ban on visiting other people's homes is to be imposed across Scotland, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has announced. The measure is already in place for more than 1.75 million people in Glasgow and some neighbouring areas. But Ms Sturgeon said it would be rolled out across the whole of Scotland from Wednesday in a bid to get the virus under control again before winter. She also confirmed that Scotland would be following England in imposing a 10pm curfew on pubs and restaurants. The curfew will be in place from Friday - with Ms Sturgeon warning that any premises that do not comply could be shut down completely. Indoor and outdoor gatherings in Scotland were restricted to six people from two households just two weeks ago. Live reaction to Ms Sturgeon's statement What are the latest rules in Scotland? 'We've reached a perilous turning point' - PM However, the number of people testing positive for the virus has continued to increase since then - with the average number of new cases every day now reaching 285, compared to only seven a day in July. The 383 new cases confirmed on Tuesday was the highest daily total since 15 April, and the sixth highest since the outbreak began in Scotland. The first minister said hospital and intensive care admissions were also starting to rise, with more older people testing positive. She said the country therefore had to go further to prevent the virus spreading unchecked, and that the scientific advice was that household interaction was a ""key driver"" of transmission. Ms Sturgeon said the Scottish government had therefore decided ""after careful consideration"" that visiting other people's homes will no longer be permitted. The move means Scotland will have tougher coronavirus restrictions than England - where people can can still meet in groups of up to six in a house. She said: ""One of the reasons we have decided to do this is that our early data suggests this restriction is starting to slow the increase of cases in the west of Scotland. ""So if we extend it nationwide now, in an early and preventative way, we hope it will help to bring the R number down and the virus back under control."" Regulations enforcing the changes will come into place from Friday, but Ms Sturgeon said everyone should comply from Wednesday. The first minister said the new restrictions on visiting other households would be reviewed every three weeks - and stressed that they will ""not necessarily"" be in place for as long as six months, as some reports have suggested. There will be exceptions for those living alone, or alone with children, who form extended households. The rules will also not apply to couples who do not live together, or to tradespeople or for the provision of informal childcare - such as by grandparents. Meetings in public indoor settings - such as pubs and restaurants - will continue to be limited to a maximum of six people from two households. And up to six people from two different households can continue to meet outdoors, including in private gardens. Ms Sturgeon urged people not to book foreign trips during the October holiday However, children under the age of 12will be exemptfrom both the limit of six and the limit of two households if they are meeting outside. And young people aged between 12 to 18 will be exempt from the two household limit - so will be able to meet outdoors in groups of up to six. Ms Sturgeon acknowledged: ""The measures I am announcing today are tough - I will not pretend otherwise - but they do not represent a full-scale lockdown of the kind imposed in March. ""Indeed, today's measures are an attempt to avoid another lockdown. ""By acting early and substantially, our hope is that these new measures will be in place for a shorter period than would be the case if we waited longer to act."" The first minister said she was keeping the option of a so-called circuit breaker -  a short period of nationwide lockdown, potentially during the October holiday - under review. She urged peoplenot to book overseas travelfor the October break ""unless it is absolutely essential"", and advised against car sharing with people outside your own household. Ms Sturgeon made her statement to the Scottish Parliament shortly after Prime Minister Boris Johnsonoutlined new measures in Englandin the House of Commons. The two leaders and their counterparts in Wales and Northern Ireland have held talks over a UK-wide approach over the past 24 hours. Both the UK and Scottish leaders made television broadcasts to the nation on Tuesday evening. Prime Minister Boris Johnson called on the public to ""summon the discipline and the resolve"" to follow the new rules, warning the government may go further if people do not stick to them. Mr Johnson said while the vast majority have complied with the measures so far, ""there have been too many breaches"". Immediately afterwards,Nicola Sturgeon said the latest restrictions may feel like a ""step backwards"", but urged Scots to stick with them anyway, insisting they ""will make a difference"". She said: ""Please know that thanks to all your efforts over the last six months, we are in a much stronger position than in the spring."" The day's announcements came after theUK's Covid-19 alert level moved to 4, meaning the virus is ""high or rising exponentially"". The licensed trade has warned that forcing them to close at 10pm could lead to further job losses Stephen Montgomery of the Scottish Hospitality Group, which represents more than 50 pubs and restaurants, accused Ms Sturgeon of ""singling out"" the industry despite ""very little evidence"" that it is linked to the spread of the virus. He said: ""With 90,000 Scottish jobs at risk we are heading towards a cliff edge and time is running out. ""We have been speaking with government and that will be ongoing but there is only a matter of months before the restrictions on our industry will have irreparable long-term damage on our sector."" The Scottish Tourism Alliance said the curfew on pubs and restaurants was ""likely to be the last straw for many businesses which were only just managing to break even"". The Scottish Chambers of Commerce warned that ""stricter measures in Scotland are undeniably more dangerous for the survival of businesses"" and called for more support to be given by both the Scottish and UK governments. The Conservatives said the Scottish government had only hired 874 contact tracers so far, despitesaying in May,externalthat 2,000 contact tracing staff would be required to ""deliver a sustainable service across Scotland"". Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said it was clear that Scotland's test and trace system was ""not working"" and that ""too often the system is overwhelmed"". The new Scottish restrictions are more extensive than those announced by Boris Johnson for England. Nicola Sturgeon has matched the prime minister by introducing a 10pm curfew for bars and restaurants. Table service and some of the other new requirements for England already apply in Scotland. In her Holyrood statement, the first minister said she was aligning with other UK nations ""as far as possible"". She also said her scientific team had advised that the UK government's package ""on its own will not be sufficient"" to bring coronavirus under control. The Scottish government's gone significantly further by extending the West of Scotland ban on visiting others in their own homes nationwide. Nicola Sturgeon said the new rules would be reviewed every three weeks and need not all last for six months - which was the timescale Boris Johnson suggested for his measures. All governments intend to back up their policies with enforcement but there has been no mention of big new fines in Scotland. This is devolved decision making in action in the biggest crisis since the creation of the Scottish Parliament. Some argue divergence across the UK is confusing and undesirable but opinion polls consistently suggest the Scottish public trust Holyrood to set the pace.

Nicola Sturgeon said the new rules would be reviewed every three weeks and need not all last for six months - which was the timescale Boris Johnson suggested for his measures. All governments intend to back up their policies with enforcement but there has been no mention of big new fines in Scotland. This is devolved decision making in action in the biggest crisis since the creation of the Scottish Parliament. Some argue divergence across the UK is confusing and undesirable but opinion polls consistently suggest the Scottish public trust Holyrood to set the pace.

English pubs to close at 10pm amid Covid spread,"All pubs, bars, restaurants and other hospitality venues in England must have a 22:00 closing time from Thursday, to help curb the spread of coronavirus. The sector will also be restricted by law to table service only. Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove said people should also work from home ""if they can"" andtrials of spectators at sports fixtures would be ""paused"". The full measures will be set out by the prime minister in the House of Commons later. Boris Johnson will also address the nation in a live broadcast at 20:00 BST on Tuesday. It comes asthe UK's Covid-19 alert level moved to 4, meaning transmission is ""high or rising exponentially"". Mr Gove told BBC Breakfast that there was evidence the 22:00 closing time has a ""beneficial effect"" on the spread of the virus in areas where the restriction has already been tried. How does the Covid-19 alert level system work? How many cases are there in your area? He denied the government was wrong to relax coronavirus measures against the virus in the summer, describing the new restrictions as a ""recalibration which we hope and believe will be enough to check the spread"". ""We're not going back to the sorts of measures that we had in the spring,"" he said. ""If people can work from home they should"", he added. ""But I stress that it's very important that those people whose jobs require them to be in a specific workplace do so."" Mr Gove said plans for sport with live audiences to return from 1 October were being halted ""for the moment"" because of the risk of fans mixing on the way to the stadium or during half-time. The government's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance haswarned there could be 50,000 new coronavirus cases a day by mid-Octoberwithout further action - which, he said, could lead to more than 200 deaths per day by mid-November. Prof Calum Semple, an expert in outbreak medicine at the University of Liverpool, told BBC Breakfast current data was ""tracking the worst-case scenario quite accurately"". He said there was now a rise in hospital admissions, including among women aged 20 to 40, who were at risk of exposure to the virus because of their work in hospitality, caring roles or because they were parents of schoolchildren. The UK needed ""quite a lot more"" restrictions in place to prevent the spread, and the hospitality industry will probably have to take another ""hit"", Prof Semple said. Andy Wood, chief executive of the Adnams brewery, told the Today programme that the pub industry had taken health messages seriously and it seemed ""incongruous"" to be singled out. He said the industry was still ""on life support"" with about 900,000 jobs at risk. On Monday, a further 4,368 daily cases and 11 deaths were reported in the UK. Also: Further restrictions will also be announcedin Scotlandon Tuesday Restrictions on households mixing indoorswill be extended to all of Northern Ireland Also from 18:00 on Tuesday,four more counties in south Wales will face new measures, including a 23:00 curfew for pubs and bars New measureswill also come into force in Lancashire, Merseyside, parts of the Midlands and West Yorkshirefrom Tuesday. Other areas of England, Scotland and Wales are already underlocal lockdown, with restrictions including a ban on mixing with other households. People are understandably asking what difference closing at 22:00 makes. Coupled with the table service law, it will be little more than a marginal gain. But what ministers hope is that the move, along with the rule of six, will act as a warning to the public that efforts to curb the virus need to be redoubled. What remains to be seen is whether any other restrictions will accompany this move. It seems inevitable that the virus will continue to spread - that's what respiratory viruses do during winter, especially one for which there is limited immunity and no vaccine. But how quickly and widely - no one knows. The risk of trying to suppress the virus is the government will soon find itself having to make another decision about further steps. How far are ministers prepared to go? Every restriction that is taken has a negative consequence to society. But the nature of the virus means lives will undoubtedly be lost the more it spreads. Balancing those two harms will define the next six months. The cabinet will meet on Tuesday morning and Boris Johnson will also chair a Cobra emergency meeting - which will be attended by the first ministers of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Speaking about the new closing times, a No 10 spokesperson said: ""We know this won't be easy, but we must take further action to control the resurgence in cases of the virus and protect the NHS."" Tighter restrictions on pub and restaurant opening times are already in place in parts of north-east and north-west England, and Wales. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey described the new rules as ""a step backwards"", as he urged the government to fix the test and trace system and help the hospitality sector. ""After people have already been through so much hardship, we cannot allow thousands of jobs to disappear overnight,"" he said. There were also calls for support from within the hospitality sector. Kate Nicholls, chief executive of trade body UKHospitality, said the new rules should be ""applied with flexibility"", and that a 22:00 closing time was ""bad for business and bad for controlling the virus"". She added: ""Table service has been widely adopted in some parts of the sector since reopening, but it is not necessary across all businesses, such as coffee shops."" Meanwhile, Michael Kill, chief executive of the Night-Time Industries Association, warned the move would result in a ""surge of unregulated events and house parties"". If Boris Johnson had decreed a year ago that he was going to call last orders on the pub at 22:00, the ravens might have left the Tower. But given the terrible warnings from the government's top scientists on Monday, thekind of strict measures that ministers had been discussing- and the extent of restrictions that many people are already living with in some of our towns and cities - you might wonder if what the prime minister has ended up deciding is less stringent than it might have been. As we have talked about many times, Downing Street is all too aware of the economic havoc the restrictions around the pandemic have caused. Logically, therefore, it has always only wanted to take action when it has felt absolutely urgent. It is also the case that, as we enter a second surge, more is understood about the virus itself. That means the government ought to be able to take a more sophisticated approach to managing the spread, rather than blunt, blunderbuss nationwide measures. At least for now, the prime minister has concluded there is a narrow, but real chance to put the brakes on the outbreak before taking more draconian steps. Read more from Laura. It comes as Christopher Snowdon, head of lifestyle economics at free-market think tank the Institute of Economic Affairs, said the latest restrictions seemed ""to have emerged from a random policy generator"" as he called on the government to publish the evidence upon which it was based. ""While mandatory table service has been part of the successful Swedish approach and may have merit, the new closing time will be devastating to a hospitality sector that was already suffering after the first lockdown,"" he said. The prime minister's announcement on closing times comes after a series of meetings over the weekend, including with the government's chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty, Chancellor Rishi Sunak and Health Secretary Matt Hancock.

New lockdown restrictions loom for four more areas,"This video can not be played ""Everyone will be affected financially"" New restrictions have come into effect in much of south Wales as Covid-19 cases continue to rise. Bridgend, Blaenau Gwent, Merthyr Tydfil and Newport have joined Caerphilly and Rhondda Cynon Taf in lockdowns thatnow affect a quarter of the population. People will not be able to enter or leave the areas without a reasonable excuse. However First Minister Mark Drakeford has urged people across Wales to only travel if essential. BBC Wales understands he will announce further measures later, including requiring pubs and restaurants to close at 10pm and limiting them to table service only. Health Minister Vaughan Gething told the Welsh Parliament measures similar to those being introduced in England were being considered. It follows a meeting between Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Mr Drakeford and first ministers from Northern Ireland and Scotland on Tuesday morning. Caerphilly and Rhondda Cynon Taf were the first areas to have local lockdowns in Wales. Earlier, Dr Giri Shankar of Public Health Wales (PHW) said Cardiff, the Vale of Glamorgan, Swansea, Carmarthenshire, Anglesey, Conwy, Denbighshire and Flintshire were also being monitored, and could face local restrictions. Speaking in the Senedd in response to Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price, Mr Drakeford said: ""I will want to say something later today about trying to encourage people in Wales, only to make those journeys that are really necessary. ""I think every one of us should be asking ourselves - 'is that journey really essential?' ""Because the fewer people you meet, the fewer journeys you make, the less danger you are posing to yourself and others."" But he said ""many"" of the items the prime minister spoke of in the House of Commons for England have already been done in Wales, such as emphasising work from home. ""We have never gone down the line of saying that people should get back on the bus and get back into work,"" Mr Drakeford said. Covid in Wales: Live updates on local lockdowns Vaughan Gething is due to hold a meeting with the local authorities affected by the tighter restrictions, as well as neighbouring councils, the NHS and police, for what he described as a ""joined-up regional conversation"". He told a media briefing on Monday that if data suggested further restrictions were needed across the whole region ""then we can, of course, make that decision"". Dr Shankar, a coronavirus incident director at PHW, said people were ""really diligent"" during the first lockdown and coronavirus case numbers came down - but success is dependent on compliance. He said local lockdowns needed to be in place for a minimum of three weeks in order to have any effect, and it was hoped a national lockdown would be avoided. What can I do during local lockdowns? English pubs to close at 10pm amid Covid spread Covid 19: How many cases are there in Wales? ""I certainly hope that we don't get to that position but if case numbers continue to go up and we see more people going into hospital and needing intensive care and we see cases in our vulnerable groups... we might have to consider complete lockdowns."" He said case numbers were still increasing in RCT despite the lockdown but seemed to be stabilising in Caerphilly. ""That doesn't always mean people are not complying, we've also initiated active case finding so we're working hard to find cases and some of the case numbers can be explained because of that."" The number of people in hospital have started to go up, he added, and ""sadly at some point we will expect to see some fatalities"". Merthyr Tydfil has the highest Covid-19 case rate in Wales over the past week with 112.7 cases per 100,000, closely followed by RCT with 102.4. Both Bridgend and Blaenau Gwent have case rates above 65 per 100,000 for the past week. Caerphilly, under lockdown for two weeks, has eased off slightly to 38.7 cases per 100,000 but Carmarthenshire is now not far behind it. Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales PHW data, published on Tuesday, showed Wales' average was 32.1 cases per 100,000. The new restrictions affect 431,000 people, meaning just over 850,000 will be under local lockdown from Tuesday at 18:00 BST - more than a quarter of the 3.1m people who live in Wales. The six counties hit with the lockdown restrictions all adjoin one another in south east Wales Under therules, nobody is able to enter or leave the six counties without a ""reasonable excuse"". Excuses listed in the law include travelling to work if you are not able to work from home, to go to school, or to give care. You can travel to buy food and medical supplies, seek medical assistance or go to the vets, and move home. If you are buying essential items and there is no reasonable alternative to using shops within these counties, you can do so. However, in most cases there are expected to be alternative options, even if this involves travelling a bit further than you would normally. Other reasons include: Obtaining supplies for the essential upkeep, maintenance and functioning of the household, or the household of a vulnerable person Elite athletic training and competitions To provide or receive emergency assistance To meet a legal obligation, and to access or receive public services To avoid injury or illness or escape a risk of harm Otherwise, the borders are effectively closed. Friends and family can no longer meet indoors, while overnight stays are also banned. All licensed premises, including pubs, will have to shut at 23:00. This video can not be played Traders in Mumbles have mixed views of what lies ahead for the area Valerie Woodall, 74, who owns the Fairytale of Mumbles shop in the Swansea area, reopened last Monday after being shut for six months. However with Swansea being monitored for further potential measures, she is not sure what the future holds. She said: ""I don't know what it'll be like in a few weeks' time... possibly I might close again. ""I tried to be quite positive about it, I think it's very sad for the young people and it's very hard for people who are on their own."" Michael Greene said his fishmongers, Coakley's, was busy during lockdown However others find their services in demand as lockdown looms. Fishmonger Michael Greene, also in Mumbles, said: ""It does keep us busy, a lockdown is good and bad for us at the same time."" Sarah Davies, a shop manager at Port Tennant, said: ""The shops have managed the queues outside quite well. ""The restrictions have been put in place quite well... in the area we've managed to stay relatively consistent."" Sarah Davies praised the way businesses in Swansea have embraced coronavirus measures Newport council leader Jane Mudd said she was very supportive of the lockdown measures brought in by the Welsh Government. ""Despite the warnings that we needed to follow the rules already in place, we have seen numbers of cases continue to rise significantly,"" she said. Ms Mudd added there was evidence of people entering each others' homes and spread the virus, showing social distancing had ""lapsed"" - and proving its importance. ""The vast majority have worked really hard to follow these rules and it is unfortunate that some have become complacent."" Bridgend council leader Mr David said: ""There is a chance that we can avoid local restrictions in other parts of Wales, but it is down to the people of Wales strictly following the law and following the guidance."" He said people should maintain social distancing, wash their hands frequently and ""if they've got the symptoms, stay at home"". Blaenau Gwent council leader Nigel Daniels said: ""Only by working together can we help break the cycle of infection, protect our loved ones, the wider Blaenau Gwent community and prevent further more widespread restrictions."" Merthyr Tydfil council deputy leader Lisa Mytton said she was ""deeply disappointed"" by the need for a local lockdown., adding: ""It is something we were fighting to avoid."" After the Cobra meeting, a Welsh Government spokesman said the Cobra meeting discussed a series of UK-wide actions in response to the increase in Covid-19 transmission. ""The first minister also welcomed the prime minister's commitment to having a regular and reliable rhythm to UK-wide decision making - with the devolved governments having a clear and important role in that process.""
