Council admits liability after teacher attacked pupils,"Linda McCall was convicted of attacks on vulnerable children A council has admitted liability after a teacher was convicted of attacks on vulnerable children with learning difficulties, BBC Scotland has learned. Linda McCall, who was employed by Scottish Borders Council (SBC), was found guilty in July of assaulting five pupils. The youngsters are autistic, non-verbal and were aged between five and seven years old at the time. The law prevents the publication of any information which may identify them. The BBC has been told SBC has now admitted liability for the actions of McCall in a civil case launched by the parents of the children who suffered. The legal case was raised against the local authority as the employer of the teacher. Five parents told BBC Scotland of the ""life-changing trauma"" inflicted on their families. One mother said her son had tried to harm himself while another father said he lived with guilt which had driven him to the point of depression. Another parent told how McCall pulled her son along the floor violently. ""My son was crying uncontrollably,"" they said. ""He was very scared to go to school and was hiding his uniform."" Commenting on the confirmation that SBC admitted liability, the lawyer acting for the families said this marked the end of a ""long and tortuous road to justice"". Marina Urie, from Thompsons Solicitors, told the BBC: ""The families are massively relieved Scottish Borders Council has done the decent thing and finally admitted liability. ""It means a huge amount."" She said they felt vindicated after a long process stemming back many years. ""They were met with a brick wall by the council who assured them nothing had happened and this admission now five years down the line is a huge moment for them,"" she said. The allegations against McCall first emerged in 2017. The teacher was placed on a period of paid leave while SBC carried out an internal investigation. BBC Scotland obtained a document in which one parent was given assurances by the council BBC Scotland obtained a document from 2018 in which one parent was given assurances by the council that the abuse accusations against McCall ""did not affect"" her son in any way. The email states the local authority's ""thorough"" investigation had resulted in ""no further action"" against McCall. The woman's son was later confirmed as a victim in McCall's criminal conviction. Each of the five parents who have spoken to the BBC claim the council failed to inform them their children were victims. They describe first learning of the abuse from Police Scotland when criminal proceedings were later initiated. In the wake of BBC Scotland's report, SBC set up an independent investigation earlier this year to look into how it handled complaints about the teacher. Andrew Webster QC is examining how an internal council inquiry initially cleared her of any wrongdoing. The inquiry has yet to report its findings. The mother of one child harmed by McCall told the BBC she cried when news came through the council had admitted liability in the civil case. She said: ""It is like coming to the end of a very long battle. ""I thought we were not going to get here. I opened the email with the news and I was in tears. It is such a relief to feel finally believed. ""To have them admit they were wrong feels like a massive weight lifted."" Another parent said: ""I feel vindicated. Years ago I asked what was going on. They insisted nothing happened to my kid. ""Finally someone has taken some responsibility for the trauma we have been through."" SBC said it could not comment. Scottish Borders Council said it could not comment A spokesman said: ""This remains an ongoing legal matter which is being dealt with by external solicitors on behalf of SBC. ""We have no further comment to make at this stage."" Christine Grahame, SNP MSP for Midlothian South, Tweeddale and Lauderdale, spoke of her relief. She said: ""I first met the parents three and a half years ago. ""This is about the council admitting they got it wrong. They brushed off the parents. ""Their campaign has been vindicated. They treated these parents and children abysmally.""

Academics at 37 universities back strike action,"Staff and students in a protest march at University College London (UCL) in support of strikes in 2019 Academics at 37 universities have voted in favour of more strike action in a long-running row over pensions. Members of the University and College Union (UCU) who took part voted 76% in favour of strike action - with 88% in favour of action short of a strike. The vote does not mean that industrial action is inevitable. Universities UK said the result was ""disappointing"" but said the union had failed to secure a mandate at almost half the institutions that had ballots. The UCU said universities needed ""to urgently revoke the pension cuts and return to the negotiating table to avoid strike action"". The ballot covered 68 universities - of those, 35 met the 50% turnout threshold that is legally required for a strike. The threshold does not apply to two universities in Northern Ireland - Ulster and Queen's University Belfast. The dispute over pensions has been rumbling on for nearly a decade, and was reignited because of what the UCU described as a ""flawed valuation"" of the Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS) pension fund. The UCU said it was ""carried out at the start of the pandemic when global markets were crashing"" and would lower members' guaranteed retirement income by 35%. The union is expecting the results of another ballot on pay and conditions on Friday. Following that, the union's higher education committee will meet to decide the next steps, after consulting branches. Further strikes looming at universities this term UCU general secretary Jo Grady said: ""These results are a clear mandate for strike action over pension cuts and should be heard loud and clear by university employers. ""Staff in universities have given their all to support students during the pandemic, but management have responded by trying to slash their guaranteed pension by 35%."" Ms Grady said avoiding strike action was ""the outcome staff want"", and called on universities to ""withdraw the needless cuts"". For some students a winter of disruption lies ahead. As well as this vote on pensions, the results of ballots at many more universities across the UK on pay and conditions are expected. But so far the results suggest lecturers and other staff, such as librarians, have mixed feelings about causing students to miss out any further. When this dispute began students joined picket lines in 2020 in support of their lecturers. But that was before the pandemic left many studying for their degrees online, from their bedrooms. The transformative shift to online learning during lockdowns may also provide universities with a way to minimise the impact. The National Union of Students (NUS) said it stood ""in solidarity"" with staff who voted for industrial action because they were doing ""more work for less reward"". Hillary Gyebi-Ababio, its vice-president for higher education, said: ""Staff working conditions are our learning conditions, and we must stand together if we are to realise a system that is truly student-centered and democratised."" Universities UK said: ""While it is disappointing to see some UCU members think industrial action over pensions is justified, the union has failed to secure a mandate for industrial action in 31 of the 68 institutions, meaning fewer branches have reached the threshold than in previous ballots. ""Union members voting 'yes' to strike action at eligible branches account for less than 7% of the scheme's total active membership... ""The employers' proposals for reform are the only viable plans under current regulations that will keep the scheme affordable for members and universities and keep the defined benefit section of the scheme open."" The universities also say a range of measures could mitigate the impact of the pension changes on employees. Last year, staff at 74 universities held a 14-day strikeover pensions, pay, and conditions,and there was also actionin 2019and 2018. The 37 institutions where staff are able to take strike action over pensions are:Institute of Development Studies; Aston University; Birkbeck, UoL; Durham University; Goldsmiths, UoL; Heriot-Watt University; Imperial College London; Keele University; King's College London; London School of Economics; London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine; Loughborough University; Open University; Royal Holloway, UoL; SOAS, UoL; The University of Birmingham; The University of Dundee; The University of Kent; The University of Leeds; The University of Nottingham; The University of Sheffield; The University of Stirling; University of Bath; University of Belfast; University of Bradford; University of Bristol; University of Cambridge; University of Edinburgh; University of Essex; University of Glasgow; University of Lancaster; University of Liverpool; University of Reading; University of St Andrews; University of Sussex; University of Ulster; University of York Further strikes looming at universities this term Students hit by 14-day university staff strike University staff strike over pensions and pay Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser Night-time curfew imposed in fire-hit areas of LA as police warn against 'despicable' looting 'I have nothing to go back to' - BBC reporter tells of LA fires heartbreak Trump avoids prison or fine in hush-money case sentencing LA fires: How three days of devastation unfolded What's the latest on the Los Angeles wildfires and what caused them?

France-UK fishing talks 'useful and positive',"Talks to resolve the fishing row between the UK and France were ""useful and positive"", the French Europe minister has said. But there was no breakthrough and there will be more talks next week. Tensions flared last month after the UK and Jersey denied fishing permits to several French boats. France has threatened to stop British trawlers from landing their catches at French ports unless more permits are granted in return covering UK waters. France's Clement Beaune said his meeting in Paris with Brexit minister Lord Frost had been useful and positive, but significant differences remained. ""All options are still on the table,"" Mr Beaune said, adding that ""as long as dialogue seems possible... we are giving it a chance"". ""There is still a lot of work to do,"" he said, claiming that France should be entitled to about 200 more fishing licences. The UK government has insisted the overwhelming majority of applications for licences have been granted. Why is there a Brexit fishing row? Who really owns UK fishing rights? Boris Johnson's official spokesman said the French government had given assurances that while the talks continued it would not immediately restore their threats. ""They've made it clear to us they're not planning to introduce them in the short-term. Both sides are keen to have further discussions,"" he said. Lord Frost and Clement Beaune met in Paris Lord Frost will meet European Commission vice-president Maros Sefcovic in Brussels on Friday. On Wednesday, a British trawler, detained last week after French authorities said it did not have a licence,was released. The Scottish-registered scallop dredger Cornelis Gert Jan arrived back in the UK in the early hours of Thursday morning, after leaving Le Havre the previous evening. The crew of the Cornelis Gert Jan stand on the deck as they leave the northern French port of Le Havre In short, it's about how many French fishing boats can catch fish in UK waters. Under the Brexit trade deal, the EU and UK agreed they would give licences to boats if they can show they have fished in each other's waters for years. But there have been disagreements about how much evidence is needed. Big trawlers will routinely collect this information automatically. But smaller vessels that come from French harbours to fish around the Channel Islands, for example, can find it harder to provide the proof needed.

Paterson quits as MP over lobbying row 'nightmare',"Owen Paterson has been at the centre of a row over how to police MPs' conduct Owen Paterson has resigned as an MP after a row over his conduct led to a government U-turn. The Conservative was found to have broken lobbying rules and was facing suspension - untilTory MPs blocked itby calling for an overhaul of the MPs' standards watchdog instead. They initially had the backing of No 10, butDowning Street reversed its decision after a furious backlash. Mr Paterson said he now wanted a life ""outside the cruel world of politics"". In a statement, the 65-year-old, who has represented North Shropshire since 1997, said the past two years had been ""an indescribable nightmare for my family and me"". He said his integrity had been ""repeatedly and publicly questioned"", and claimed he was ""totally innocent"" of breaking lobbying rules. Parties may stand aside in post-Paterson by-election Government U-turn over MPs' conduct plan What is lobbying? A brief guide What did Owen Paterson do? Prime Minister Boris Johnson paid tribute to his ""friend and colleague"", saying he had had a ""distinguished career"" and was a ""voice for freedom"". But other MPs said he needed to be held to account for his actions, with one, Labour's Sam Tarry, tweeting: ""Good riddance."" Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has called on the prime minister to apologise to the whole country for the ""chaotic"" past 24 hours, and for his ""grubby attempt to cover up for the misdemeanour of his friend"". By Damian Grammaticas, political correspondent The past 24 hours have clearly been damaging to Boris Johnson and the government. There's been a hit to both on the issue of integrity - a perception this was sleazy, undermining of standards. There's also been a hit to the prime minister within the Conservative Party. Dozens of his MPs disobeyed when told to vote to block Owen Paterson's immediate suspension. Every rebellion chips away at a prime minister's authority. The government's swift U-turn, making Wednesday's vote meaningless, only dismayed more MPs and left questions about poor decision-making at the top. The government says its aim is to improve the standards system. But if so that task will be harder now, as there's suspicion about its motives - and the opposition will have to be satisfied with whatever it proposes. And there's to be a by-election, which will play out under intense scrutiny, with the opposition undoubtedly hammering away that issue of sleaze. The Commons Standards Committee concluded last week that Mr Paterson had misused his position as an MP to benefit two firms he worked for, after a damning report on his behaviour by standards commissioner Kathryn Stone. It recommended he be suspended from the Commons for 30 sitting days - a sanction that could also lead to a recall petition in his constituency, and the possibility of him facing a by-election. Such recommendations - which have to be signed off by MPs - are usually accepted without much discussion. But on Wednesday, the government ordered its MPs to vote for an amendment to halt Mr Paterson's case and to rejig the standards system. Owen Paterson (far left) was a minister in the coalition government under David Cameron (far right) Born in Whitchurch, Shropshire, in 1956, he studied history at Cambridge University, before joining his family leather business, of which he later became managing director. He was first elected MP for North Shropshire in 1997 and had a majority of almost 23,000 at the last general election. Paterson was made Northern Ireland secretary in 2010, moving to become environment secretary in 2012. After leaving the government in 2014 he was a strong supporter of Brexit. His wife Rose, chair of Aintree racecourse, took her own life in 2020. The couple had three children. Opposition parties accused the Conservatives of corruption and sleaze, saying they were just looking out for their own MP, and Labour, the SNP and the Liberal Democrats refused to take part in any new process. On Thursday morning, Commons leader Jacob Rees-Mogg announced a U-turn, saying no new process would go ahead without cross-party support and any changes would not be made retrospectively in Mr Paterson's case. Mr Paterson did not know the government was going to ditch the proposals ahead of Mr Rees-Mogg's announcement and was in a supermarket when told the news by a BBC journalist. The prime minister's spokesman said he had ""recognised the strength of feeling on all sides of the House around the issue and changed his mind when it became clear that a cross-party consensus on the changes was not possible"". But Labour's Sir Keir said Mr Johnson ""must explain how he intends to fix the immense harm he has done to confidence in the probity of him and his MPs"". And despite Mr Paterson's resignation, the SNP's Pete Wishart said it was ""not the end of this sorry saga"". He tweeted: ""Something rotten has happened in the last couple of days and the extraordinary behaviour of this government must be examined."" This video can not be played MPs' vote created ""a certain amount of controversy"", says Jacob Rees-Mogg Mr Paterson said it was a ""painful decision"" to resign but ""the right one"". He said the past few days had been ""intolerable"", claiming he had seen people - including MPs - ""publicly mock and deride"" the death of his wife Rose, who took her own life last year. In an earlier statement, the former Northern Ireland secretary said the investigation into his conduct had been ""a major contributory factor"" in her death. On Thursday, Mr Paterson added: ""My children have therefore asked me to leave politics altogether, for my sake as well as theirs. ""I agree with them. I do not want my wife's memory and reputation to become a political football. Above all, I always put my family first."" Office vandalised due to Paterson vote, MP claims Who's who in the Owen Paterson row? There was no mention of the standards row in Mr Johnson's tribute to the Tory MP, instead saying: ""I am very sad that Parliament will lose the services of Owen Paterson who has been a friend and colleague of mine for decades. ""He has had a distinguished career, serving in two cabinet positions, and above all he has been a voice for freedom - for free markets and free trade and free societies - and he was an early and powerful champion of Brexit. ""I know that this must have been a very difficult decision but I can understand why - after the tragic circumstances in which he lost his beloved wife Rose - he has decided to put his family first."" Mr Paterson's resignation means there will shortly be a by-election for his safe Conservative seat. Owen Paterson watched on in the Commons as MPs debated whether to suspend him Mr Paterson has been a paid consultant for clinical diagnostics company Randox since 2015 and to meat distributor Lynn's Country Foods since 2016, earning a total of Â£100,000 a year on top of his MP's salary. MPs are allowed to have these jobs, but are not allowed to be paid advocates - using their influence in Whitehall for the company's gain. The committee concluded,externalthat Mr Paterson had breached this rule on paid advocacy by: Making three approaches to the Food Standards Agency relating to Randox and the testing of antibiotics in milk Making seven approaches to the Food Standards Agency relating to Lynn's Country Foods Making four approaches to ministers at the Department for International Development relating to Randox and blood testing technology Mr Paterson was also found to have broken conduct rules by: Failing to declare his interest as a paid consultant to Lynn's Country Foods in four emails to officials at the Food Standards Agency Using his parliamentary office on 16 occasions for business meetings with his clients And in sending two letters relating to his business interests, on House of Commons headed notepaper What did Owen Paterson do?

Woman goes to Lithuania for op over waiting lists,"Jill Davies was told there was a three-year waiting list for a new hip and said she could hardly walk A woman travelled to Lithuania for a hip replacement because the NHS in Wales faces such huge waiting lists. Jill Davies, from Birchgrove, Swansea, waited four years to see a consultant and was told there was a further three-year wait for an operation. It comes as a surgeon warned patients on waiting lists had been questioning whether their lives were worth living. The Welsh government said it wanted to ""radically transform"" how healthcare was delivered. Welsh ambulances face unprecedented pressure, minister says Waiting times hit record levels Ms Davies, 66, a retired head teacher, was told in 2016 she had arthritis in both hips and that it was more severe in her right, but only in December 2020 was she referred to a hip consultant. ""By that time I could not really walk,"" she said. ""I was down to walking like 25 metres, using a stick all the time. If I went shopping I used to hire one of the scooters because I was lacking in mobility at that time."" When she finally saw the consultant this year he told her he would put her on the waiting list for an operation, but that it would take three years. ""At that point I burst into tears,"" Ms Davies said. She was ""absolutely flattened"" so decided to go to Lithuania for treatment. She contacted a clinic on 1 July, flew out on the 22nd and had her operation on 24 July, followed by a 10-day intensive rehabilitation programme. ""I'm in no pain,"" she said. ""I can walk, I'm swimming, I can drive and do what I want to do. I've got my life back."" Surgeon Paul Williams said the effect of long delays on mental and physical health was ""horrific"" Paul Williams, an orthopaedic surgeon at Neath Port Talbot Hospital, said the effect of long delays on mental and physical health was ""horrific"". He said: ""To be living with pain from an arthritic joint is terrible. ""We sent out a questionnaire recently and many of the patients have actually replied that they're questioning if their life is worth living because of the pain they're in."" The latest figures for the Welsh NHS showed another record high for those waiting for hospital treatment. The number of patients waiting more than 36 weeks has grown from 25,634 in February 2020 to 243,674 by August 2021. The longest waits included 56,279 people who needed orthopaedic or trauma treatment. The overall waiting list for treatment is a record 657,539 -  just over a fifth of the Welsh population. In the Swansea Bay health board, which covers Swansea county and Neath Port Talbot, problems were exacerbated when elective surgery at Morriston Hospital was postponed for seven months in 2019, before the Covid pandemic hit. The health board said it planned to transform services with its three hospitals focusing on different things to protect surgery from emergency needs or winter pressures. Neath Port Talbot Hospital will become an orthopaedic centre of excellence, with investment approved by the Welsh government for four new theatres. Orthopaedic surgeon and Singleton and Neath Port Talbot hospitals' medical director, Dougie Russell, said: ""Now the pandemic's happened it's given us an opportunity to reset the whole system. ""This is our opportunity to get ourselves on a level footing."" The Royal College of Surgeons said regional hubs concentrating on routine surgery should be introduced across Wales to cope with the backlog. Mr Williams said: ""Orthopaedics has always been seen as an area where patients can wait a bit longer and a bit longer, and perhaps a bit longer still, but you can't put a price on that."" Plans for the three hospitals come as a Welsh government conference meets on Thursday to discuss tackling waiting times. Health Minister Eluned Morgan said she would invest another Â£170m a year to ""transform"" planned care. She will tell the meeting she hopes extra cash will ""build a planned care system that is bigger, better and more effective than we have seen before"". Director of the Bevan Commission think tank, Helen Howson, said fixing record waiting times would be the biggest challenge facing the NHS since its creation. She said the disruption Covid caused should force it to address problems that existed before the pandemic. The Welsh government said it wanted health boards to ""radically transform"" the way planned healthcare was delivered. As well as the Â£170m, Ms Morgan will outline Â£1m for a fund to help health boards to innovate. She said: ""The impact of the pandemic on planned care has been significant, resulting in a massive backlog of patients waiting for planned treatments. ""We need a whole system approach to how care is delivered and by investing Â£248m in Covid recovery, Â£170m in planned care and Â£42m in social care, we hope to put NHS Wales in a stronger position for future generations."" Eluned Morgan said there was a ""massive backlog of patients"" NHS Wales chief executive, Judith Padgett, said: ""We need to transform the way we deliver services. Many advancements and new ways of working have come online during the pandemic, but it is important to build on these and use the opportunity to create modern health and social services for the future.""

Welsh ministers demand scrapping of mining licence,"The debate over the mine takes place against the backdrop of the COP26 climate change summit The Welsh government has called for the mining licence for Aberpergwm colliery, near Glynneath, to be cancelled. Deputy Climate Change Minister Lee Waters said he had urged the UK government to stop ""40 million tonnes of coal"" being extracted ""from Welsh soil"" over the next 18 years. Welsh ministers have a ""clear policy of stopping using fossil fuels"", he said. But the mine operator says it supplies niche industries like water filtration and steel production. It says it provides 160 well-paid jobs in the Vale of Neath area, plus 16 apprenticeships. The UK government says final responsibility for licensing coal mines lies with the Welsh government. What are top polluters doing to cut emissions? The former coal villages turning green Phone alert system promised for coal tip residents Aberpergwm mine is the only producer of high-grade anthracite in Western Europe and it supplies the nearby Tata steel plant in Port Talbot. Speaking in the Senedd, Mr Waters said: ""Unless the UK government agree to our request to cancel a licence granted in 1996 at Aberpergwm, some 40 million tonnes of coal will be extracted from this mine by 2039 - a hundred million tonnes of carbon dioxide. Lee Waters has asked a UK government minister to intervene and keep the coal in the ground But Energybuild Ltd, which runs the mine, says Mr Waters' figures are wrong. Managing director Rhidian Davies said: ""Anthracite is a highly desirable mineral used predominately for its manufacturing characteristics as opposed to its thermal properties."" He added that Energybuild ""brought more than Â£100m of investment into the locality"". And he said carbon products ""will play a significant role in developing sustainable technology of the future, ideally in a circular economy [without waste and pollution]"". ""Our products are in significant demand to support the transition to a sustainable green economy."" The Welsh government says it is up to the UK Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS), Kwasi Kwarteng, to act to intervene to prevent ""the coal being extracted from Welsh soil"" and they have written to request his intervention. ""We don't want it to happen and the only reason it might happen is because of their [UK government] inaction and their policies,"" Mr Waters said. But a UK government spokesperson said it was a matter for the Welsh government. ""The Coal Authority is responsible for licensing coal mines, including for Aberpergwm,"" they said ""The BEIS Secretary of State is not involved in this process, as Welsh ministers have the power under the Coal Industry Act to make the final decision on whether coal mining operations in Wales can be progressed."" But the Welsh government insists they don't have the power to cancel licences that were granted before they were given control over mining regulation. Aberpergwm was originally granted a licence to mine coal before licencing powers were handed over to the Welsh government. The mine operators have recently applied to the Coal Authority for formal recognition that the conditions attached to their original licence have been fulfilled. The mine operator says its products are helping build a greener future Councillor for Glynneath, Del Morgan, said he was worried ""about the prospect of losing good job opportunities from this area, an area that badly needs employment in order to retain our young people in the community"". Mr Morgan chairs the mine's community liaison committee, where local councillors and members of the community meet the mine operator. ""I have been privy to some of the plans laid out for the colliery,"" he said. ""These include the developing market for water filtration, where good quality coal is used to remove toxins from the water without stripping the water of salts and important minerals.

Yorkshire lose right to host England matches,"Headingley held the third Test between England and India this summer Yorkshire have been suspended from hosting England matches as the England and Wales Cricket Board delivered a devastating rebuke over the club's response to racism experienced by former player Azeem Rafiq. An investigation found Rafiq was a victim of ""racial harassment and bullying"" - but the club said it would take no disciplinary action. The ECB board says the ban will last until the club has ""clearly demonstrated that it can meet the standards expected"". Meanwhile, a number of members of the Yorkshire board are set to announce their resignations on Friday before an emergency board meeting, BBC Sport understands. The board is under pressure after criticism from the ECB, sponsors and the UK government over its handling of the Rafiq case. The ECB said it was ""clear"" Yorkshire's handling of the issue was ""wholly unacceptable and is causing serious damage to the reputation of the game"". A statement said: ""Given recent events, it is clear there are serious questions regarding the governance and management of YCCC. ""The club's failure in relation to actions and responses to their own report represent a significant breach of its obligations to the game."" Yorkshire cricket racism scandal - how we got here Yorkshire board calls meeting to discuss racism allegations 'Racist language isn't friendly banter,' say British-Pakistanis The fallout from Yorkshire's response to the racism report intensified on Monday when ESPN Cricinfo reported a racist term about Rafiq's Pakistani heritage was regularly used towards him, but the investigation concluded it was ""friendly and good-natured banter"". Yorkshire's Gary Ballance, who hasadmitted using racist language towards ex-team-mate Rafiq, has been suspended indefinitely from England selection. On Thursday evening, former England captain Michael Vaughanrevealed he was named in the reportbut denied any allegation of racism. Julian Knight MP, who called for the Yorkshire board to resign this week and is chair of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport committee, said he hoped the sanctions handed down by the ECB would ""act as a short, sharp shock to bring the club to its senses"". ""Like the rest of us, I imagine the members of Yorkshire County Cricket Club will be questioning why the board is still in place,"" he added. He said it would have been ""completely unacceptable"" were Ballance still eligible for England. Headingley is due to host a men's Test against New Zealand and a men's one-day international against South Africa in 2022. The Leeds ground is also scheduled to host an Ashes Test against Australia in 2023. Kit suppliers Nike and several sponsors have cut ties with the club. The ECB board has also asked the ECB executive to commission a review, looking into whether of Yorkshire's leadership is fit for purpose. A full ECB investigation into the matter remains ongoing. Financial and further match allocation punishments could be given at the end of the ECB's investigation. Following Thursday's statement, Rafiq, 30, said: ""I need a little time to reflect on what the ECB has said this evening and the actions they're proposing to take. ""I will not be commenting further at this time."" A former England youth captain, Azeem Rafiq played for Yorkshire across two spells and captained the county in a Twenty20 fixture in 2012 Yorkshire's investigations began in September 2020 after Rafiq, who played for Yorkshire between 2008 and 2018, claimed ""institutional racism"" at the club left him close to taking his own life. After more than a year - and having been asked to do so by MPs - Yorkshire released the findings of an independent report in September which upheld seven of the 43 allegations made by Rafiq. But the club said no players, coaches or executives would face disciplinary action following the club's own investigation into the report's findings. That move - and subsequent claim that the report judged the use of a racist term as ""banter - has now led senior politicians, including health secretary Sajid Javid, to criticise the club. Senior Yorkshire officials have been called to attend a DCMS select committee hearing on 16 November, where Rafiq will also give evidence. Ballance, who has not played for England since 2017, said on Wednesday he ""regrets"" using the offensive terms. 2 September 2020:Following aninitial interview with Wisden,external,ESPN Cricinfo publish an article with Rafiq,externalin which he claims ""institutional racism"" at Yorkshire County Cricket Club left him close to taking his own life. 3 September 2020:Yorkshire saythey have launched a ""formal investigation"" into the claims made by Rafiq and chairman Roger Hutton says the club would be carrying out a ""wider review"" of their ""policies and culture"" 5 September 2020:Yorkshire ask an independent law firmto investigate racism allegations against the club by Rafiq. 13 November 2020:Rafiq sayshe hopes to bring about ""meaningful change"" after giving his first statement to the inquiry. 15 December 2020:Rafiq files a legal claimagainst Yorkshire ""claiming direct discrimination and harassment on the grounds of race, as well as victimisation and detriment as a result of trying to address racism at the club"". 2 February 2021:Yorkshire threaten a lifetime banfor anyone found to have made threats against Rafiq or his family and legal team, after ESPN Cricinfo show them messages sent to Rafiq's legal firm. 17 June 2021:An employment tribunal case between Rafiq and his former club Yorkshirefails to find a resolution.The independent investigation into his racism allegations remains ongoing. 16 August 2021:Yorkshire receive the findingsof an independent investigation into the racism allegations and, two days later, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB)asks for a copy. 19 August 2021:Yorkshire, yet to release the findings of the report at this stage,admitRafiq was ""the victim of inappropriate behaviour"" and offer him their ""profound apologies"". Rafiq accuses Yorkshire of downplaying racismby calling him the victim of ""inappropriate behaviour"". 8 September 2021:MPs tell Yorkshireto publish the findingsof the report ""immediately"". 10 September 2021:Yorkshire release the findings of the report,which says Rafiq was the ""victim of racial harassment and bullying"" and seven of the 43 allegations made by the player were upheld by an independent panel. According to Hutton, the report said there was ""insufficient evidence to conclude that Yorkshire County Cricket Club is institutionally racist"". Yorkshire released a summary of the panel's report and recommendations, but said the full report could not be released for legal reasons ""in relation to privacy law and defamation"". 8 October 2021:Yorkshire miss a deadlineto send the full report to Rafiq and his legal team after BBC Sport understands an employment judge ordered the club to release it in full by Friday, 8 October. 13 October 2021:Rafiq then receives a heavily redacted version,while the ECB says it is still awaiting the full report. 28 October 2021:Yorkshire says it carried out its own internal investigation after the findings in the reportand concludedthat ""there is no conduct or action taken by any of its employees, players or executives that warrants disciplinary action"". 2 November 2021:The Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee calls on Hutton to appear before it to answer questions about Yorkshire's handling of a report into Rafiq's allegations of racism. MP Knight, chair of the DCMS select committee,calls on the board of Yorkshire County Cricket Club to resignafter a leaked report emerges apparently containing details of the investigation into the treatment of Rafiq. A story published by ESPN says the report had concluded that a racially offensive term used towards Rafiq was regarded as ""banter"". Knight makes his comments after health secretary Javid calls for ""heads to roll"" at Yorkshire and said if the ECB did not take action ""it's not fit for purpose"". He further states in a Twitter post that the term allegedly used to describe Rafiq was ""not banter"". The ECB announces it will conduct a ""full"" investigation into the situation. 3 November 2021:The date of the DCMS hearing is scheduled for 16 November andRafiq is called to give evidence in person,along with senior Yorkshire officials. Several sponsors, including primary sponsor Emerald Publishing and Yorkshire Tea,end their partnershipswith Yorkshire County Cricket Club.

Climate denial flows unchecked on Facebook,"Climate change denial is spreading unchecked on Facebook, two studies by disinformation researchers have found. The Center for Countering Digital Hate and the Institute for Strategic Dialogue said less than 10% of misleading posts were marked as misinformation. And the CCDH researchers linked the majority of these to just 10 publishers. Facebook said this represented a small proportion of climate change content. The CCDH is a non-profit organisation which monitors and lobbies against online hate and misinformation. It found that of 7,000 misleading posts describing climate change as ""hysteria"", ""alarmism"", a ""scam"", or other related terms, only 8% were marked as misinformation. Facebook pledged to flag climate denial content early this year. The CCDH looked at a sample of posts from the past year which attracted roughly 700,000 likes and shares. Researchers used social media analytics tool Newswhip to search for strings of key words including ""climate change"", global warming"" and, ""fraud"", ""hoax"", ""cult"", ""scam"", ""lie"" and so on. The researchers manually reviewed every post to make sure it met their definition of climate denial and was not a post condemning such beliefs. Highly shared articles made false assertions that climate change was not confirmed by science or claimed to debunk it with data. Of these, 69% could be traced back to just 10 ""super-polluter"" publishers - dubbed the ""toxic ten"" - the campaign group found. In fact, our understanding of climate change comes from analyses of millions of measurements gathered in different parts of the world. And multiple independent teams of scientists have reached the same result - a spike in temperatures coinciding with the onset of the industrial era. Flooding in Indonesia has been linked to climate change- yet some online still deny its effects Many of the shared articles also pushed the unsubstantiated belief that ""climate lockdowns"" will be enforced on populations. Yet scientists point out this is highly unlikely given there is no evidence the Covid lockdowns led to a significant improvement for the climate. These posts represent the most extreme types of outright climate denial, according to the CCDH. They can't tell us the true scale of climate misinformation on the site but they do indicate climate conspiracy content is spreading without being labelled or removed by Facebook. Campaign group Stop Funding Heat, working together with think tank the Institute for Strategic Dialogue (ISD), said it had found far more misinformation which more generally ""undermines the existence or impacts of climate change, the human influence on climate change, and the need for urgent action"". Research published on Thursday analysed 48,700 posts between January and August 2021 and found just 3.6% posts containing climate misinformation included a fact-checking label. The group also identified 113 ads on Facebook with messages like ""climate change is a hoax"" between January and October 2021 with an estimated spend of between $58,000-$75,000 (about Â£42,000- 55,000). This appears to be a particular issue on Facebook. Counter-extremism think tank the ISD discovered during the 2021 German election that most of the top shared posts relating to renewable energy on the site (18 out of 25) either doubted climate change or criticised climate action. They found a similar trend on conversations around fossil fuels, with most of the top shared posts on Facebook (19 out of 25) arguing against climate action. On Twitter, on the other hand, the trend was reversed with most posts on the subjects promoting the scientific evidence or in support of climate action. Although the majority of the publishers of climate denial identified by CCDH were in the US, people from Brazil, India, Poland, Haiti, Mexico, Thailand, Russia, France and Germany were among their top viewers. And there were climate denial posts analysed by ISD from the UK, Australia, Russia, India, Poland, South Africa and Japan. A spokesperson, speaking on behalf of the Facebook platform, said the 700,000 interactions with the posts analysed by the CCDH made up a small fraction of the total 200 million interactions with climate change content on the site. ""We continue to combat climate misinformation by reducing the distribution of anything rated false or misleading by one of our fact-checking partners,"" the spokesperson said.

PM given free holiday by minister Goldsmith,"Boris Johnson has confirmed he stayed for free at a holiday home owned by the family of Lord Zac Goldsmith - who received a peerage from the PM in 2019. The list of ministers' interests says the PM has ""a longstanding personal friendship"" with the family and ""in that capacity"" stayed at their place in southern Spain last month. Downing Street had previously refused to confirm if the trip had happened. Labour said it was ""more evidence of the sleaze engulfing this government"". ""It's obvious to everyone that the prime minister is dishing out cushy jobs to his mate who pays for his luxury holidays,"" said the party's deputy leader Angela Rayner. ""Yet again Boris Johnson behaves like it's one rule for him and another for everyone else."" The party is also calling for an inquiry into why the holiday has not been declared on the Register of Members' Interests - a separate declaration made by all MPs, not just ministers. PM's explanation for Mustique trip criticised What are the rules governing political donations? Lord Goldsmith is close friend of the prime minister's wife and gave her her first job in politics. He lost his seat as an MP for Richmond Park in 2019, but retained his job as an environment minister after Mr Johnson appointed him to the House of Lords. At the time, Labour condemned the appointment as ""jobs for mates"". Boris Johnson stayed on the island of Mustique, shortly after winning the 2019 general election Mr Johnson has previously been criticised over being slow to explain how his holiday to the Caribbean island of Mustique was funded. An investigation by the Committee on Standards found he had not broken the rules but criticised the arrangements as ""ad hoc and informal"". The government is supposed to publish a list of any financial benefits received by ministers twice a year. Themost recent list includes,externalthe declaration that: ""The prime minister has a longstanding personal friendship with the Goldsmith family and, in that capacity, in October 2021, stayed in a holiday home in southern Spain which was provided free of charge by the Goldsmiths. ""Given Lord Goldsmith is a minister of the crown, the arrangement has accordingly been declared."" Mr Johnson may also declare the holiday gift in the register of MPs' interests, which is likely to include details about the cost of the donation.

It was edited by Paul Gribben. Our writers were Doug Faulkner, Bryn Palmer, Kelly-Leigh Cooper and Marie Jackson We'll be back again tomorrow - when the day's theme is youth and public empowerment. As young protesters gather in Glasgow, we will be hearing
directly from inspirational activists and young people already experiencing the
effects of climate change. And we'll be joined by Maisie and Nel, two BBC Young Reporters who will be with us as special guest journalists for the day. Here's a reminder of what has been happening today at COP26 - where there has been a focus on energy. A ship supplies feed to a salmon farm on the west coast of Scotland Chris Packham, the environmental campaigner and presenter of the BBC's Springwatch series, has visited COP26 and says the host country should ""get rid of highly polluting, nasty salmon farms"". The industry is said to be worth more than Â£1bn a year to the economy, with hundreds of thousands of fish raised in pens suspended in the open sea lochs around Scotland's west coast and the Northern Isles. The pens keep the fish - fed on processed feed - enclosed but they allow parasites to get in, with thousands of tonnes of waste getting into the surrounding water. Asked what more Scotland could be doing in the fight against climate change, Packham toldBBC Radio Scotland's Drivetimeprogramme that ""there are obviously elephants in
the room while there are salmon in those cages off the west coast"". He called for the industry to be ""transitioned out"" with investment so that people can be ""retrained into jobs that are far more harmonious and
sustainable"". Sameer HashmiMiddle East Business Correspondent Last month, Saudi Arabiaâs crown prince and de facto ruler,
Mohammed bin Salman, announced that the country had seta target of achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2060. For a long time, the worldâs largest oil exporter had
resisted calls from Western countries to set a definite target to reduce carbon
emissions. But, even as the Saudis seek to achieve that target, they are
boosting their oil production capacity to cater to global demand. The countryâs top officials have repeatedly said that
tackling climate change is necessary, but that it cannot be done by âdemonisingâ
hydrocarbons. The energy minister believes that the world needs both fossil
fuels as well as renewables. On the face of it, the kingdom has set an ambitious plan to
eliminate 278 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions per year by 2030, up
from a previous target of 130 million tonnes. It would involve investments of
$190bn (Â£139bn) during that period. But the task is not going to be easy. Saudi Arabia earns
more than half of its revenue from oil exports. Although the crown prince is
trying to promote economic diversification by investing in new industries, it is
going to take time for them to start contributing substantially to the economy. Google tells us that a lot of people seem to be searching online to find out when COP26 finishes. Well, there's quite a while left yet. Today is the fifth day of the conference, which will run up until Friday, 12 November. (But if previous COPs are any guide negotiations might carry on into the weekend.) Each day has a different theme with today's focus being energy and the transition to greener economies. All countries face problems getting their emissions down but China has the biggest challenge. Per person,China's emissions are about half those of the US, but its huge 1.4 billion population and explosive economic growth have pushed it way ahead of any other country in its overall emissions. While more than 130 countries have pledged to reach net zero emissions before 2050, China has said it's aiming for""carbon neutrality"" by 2060. It hasn't set out exactly what this means or how it will get there. Russiahas also pledged to reach net zero by 2060, although its draft commitment hasn't been legally ratified. Until recently President Vladimir Putin dismissed the risks posed by rising temperatures. Indiaset a net zero target for the first time at COP26, with a promise to cut emissions to net zero by 2070.  Vanessa Nakate (right) met Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon alongside Greta Thunberg earlier this week There is a focus on youth at COP26 on Friday - ahead of that, some activists have been speaking today at a New York Times fringe event. Nobel Peace Prize winner Malala Yousafzai and fellow campaigners Vanessa Nakate and Leah Thomas called for world leaders to listen to marginalised women and people of colour who are on the front line of the climate crisis. Yousafzai, a Pakistani education activist, said environmental catastrophes, including droughts and floods, affected education and so were not separate issues. Speaking via video-link she said: ""The consequences of climate change are not equal. Some of us are more vulnerable to the climate disasters than others."" Nakate, a climate activist from Uganda, said she does not accept that praise for young campaigners from politicians is genuine. ""They're are making us responsible - if it doesn't go well, then we failed to do it,"" she said, adding that she was putting the responsibility back on them. Kakembo's project transforms biodegradable plastics and organic waste into eco-friendly charcoal briquettes  BBC Minutehas been speaking to Kakembo Galabuzi Brian, a
young entrepreneur from Uganda whoâs at COP26 calling for more investment in
clean energy projects in developing nations. ""We need to present the community with better solutions,"" the 27-year-old says. ""Itâs very important to do it now before all the
resources run out and the Earth suffers."" His youth-focused project turns farm waste into fuel used for cooking - trying to ""replace firewood, so
we can keep the trees standing"". Kakemboâs eco-friendly work earned him the accolade of
Commonwealth Young Person of the Year in 2020. He argues that itâs hypocritical for wealthy nations to
expect poorer ones to switch to green energy sources unless they curb their own
use of fossil fuels - and offer a helping hand. âThere is no way you can tell the Ugandan government not to
explore oil unless you give them an incentive not to. So climate finance is a
really big deal for us.â We mentioned earlier aboutcriticism of the organisation and inclusivity of the COP26. Now Greta Thunberg, arguably the most well-known climate activist in the world, is doubling down on her criticism of the event. She describes the conference as the ""Great North greenwash festival"" in a tweet on Thursday. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Helen BriggsBBC environment correspondent in Glasgow Suggestions that warming could be limited to slightly under
2C if countries were to fully deliver on their commitments to reduce emissions should be treated with caution, according to two leading climate
experts. Number-crunching of revised pledges made in the run-up to
Glasgow suggest these could put the world on track to limit global warming to
1.8 or 1.9C. But Dr Carl Schleussner, of Climate Analytics, says even
under the most âoptimisticâ scenarios, governments are not yet delivering in
terms of âclosing the gap in the near termâ. And Prof Simon Lewis, of UCL, says with some targets for
peaking emissions set so far into the future, governments' commitments âneed to
be taken with a pinch of saltâ. The UN recently predicted that the world was heading for a
temperature rise of 2.7C, based on an analysis of pledges made for 2030,
excluding those in recent days. If you include net zero commitments made by
some countries from 2050 onwards, this falls to 2.2C. The predictions by the IEA and by a group of scientists in
Australia are based on revised emission plans that have come in recently from a
number of countries, including India, which aims to peak emissions in 2070. Thursday marks day five of the UN climate conference in Glasgow. Here are some images of the week so far: The climate conference got under way on Sunday, with world leaders among thousands travelling to Glasgow British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he remains ""cautiously optimistic"" about a deal to keep global temperature rise below 1.5C Prince Charles is among the attendees, seen here at an event with fashion designer and sustainability advocate Stella McCartney Climate activists - including Extinction Rebellion - have been protesting on the side of the summit There have also been less traditional demonstrations spotted on the sidelines too - including a group dressed up as Pokemon character Pikachu trying to encourage Japan to move away from coal Rebecca HenschkeAsia editor, BBC World Service When Indonesia, home to some of the worldâs most carbon-rich
forests and peatlands, signed up to a deal to halt and reverse deforestation, it
was seen as a significant step forward. But now the country's environment and forestry minister Siti
Nurbaya Bakar has released a statement onsocial
media,externalsaying that Indonesia ""canât promise what we canât do"". She said forcing Indonesia to commit to ""zero deforestation
in 2030 is clearly inappropriate and unfair"".  Despite President Joko
Widodo signing the forest deal, she said that development remained the
countryâs top priority. Minister Nurbaya argued that the countryâs vast natural
resources must be used for the benefit of its people and cited the need to cut
down forests to make way for roads.  Deforestation of Indonesia's peatland forests also threaten populations like orangutans Controversial road projects in remote areas of Borneo and Papua have opened up previously untouched rainforest and lead to a spike in illegal logging. Indonesians have responded negatively to the minister's social posts commenting that itâs often big businesses that profit off deforestation while local people are left to deal with floods and landslides. One user wrote: ""Letâs destroy all the forests, to get money minister. Then we might have money to pay for oxygen.â Ashitha NageshBBC News, London You might not think of climate protests as all-singing all-dancing - but for one activist group, thatâs exactly what they are. The group, BP or Not BP, specifically protest against oil companies giving large donations and sponsorships to cultural institutions like galleries, museums and theatres - something they say is a way for oil companies to enhance their reputations. Their first protest almost 10 years ago, in April 2012, was at the Royal Shakespeare Company. Since then theyâve done 62 ""protest-performances"" - including wheeling a large Trojan horse into the lobby of the British Museum for the museumâs Troy exhibition in February 2020. And in that time, several institutions have ended their relationships with oil companies - including Tate, the British Film Institute and the Royal Shakespeare Company. BP boss Bernard Looney responded to the protests last year when he set out an ambition for the oil company to ""reimagine energy"". âMany
question our motives in supporting the arts,"" he said. ""I get that. ""We are taking steps
to more firmly and visibly align our intentions with our actions and become
much more transparent.â Adam EastonWarsaw Correspondent A number of solar panels attached to the wall of an old house in the centre of Krakow As we reported earlier, Poland has pledged to phase out coal by the end of the 2040s,
reaffirming last yearâs agreement with trade unions to close down the last pit
by 2049. The countryâs abundant Silesian coal reserves have long fuelled the
economy and generate around 80 per cent of its electricity. But Polish power
generators must now pay for their CO2 emissions, and rising carbon costs have
rendered many plants unprofitable. After years of defiantly championing
its black treasure, Poland is now investing in renewable energy, particularly
offshore wind, and seeking EU funds to gradually close down its mines and
retrain its workers. The country now has
one of the fastest growing solar energy markets in the EU, largely due to
homeowners like Michal Dera. He replaced his
electric heating system at his home in Bedzin near one of Silesiaâs coal-fired
power plants with a heat pump and installed solar panels to generate
electricity. I made the change to have a heating system that produced fewer emissions as well as save money. We use electricity for heating the house, charging cars, cooking, lighting and other household needs. At current electricity prices the investment should pay off in 8-10 years.â Michal Dera Helen BriggsBBC environment correspondent in Glasgow Organisation of the Glasgow summit has drawn complaints,
with grumbling over the long queues to get in and restrictions for observers
following the negotiations. âThe worst COP ever,â said one COP veteran, Kenyan
policy expert Mohamed Adow. Some even went as far as to invoke the spectre of
Copenhagen, the climate talks that ended in disaster in 2009, haunted by images
of delegates queuing outside in the snow. On my journey through the Blue Zone,
my fellow queuers were fairly sanguine. Austin, from Edinburgh, had anticipated queues and felt things were running smoothly. Inside, a member of Ghanaâs
delegation blamed the queues on strict security due to Covid, while a delegate
from Tanzania said she was more concerned over restrictions that limit the
number of people from each country attending meetings. Others are less
sympathetic. Dr Kat Kramer, Christian Aidâs climate lead, with 10 COPs under
her belt, calls this the âleast inclusiveâ COP ever. She says restrictions on
civil society observers following the negotiations needs to be fixed âto
ensure vulnerable communities on the frontline of this crisis are fully
representedâ. And thereâs not enough seating or power points, she says,
and much longer queues than previous summits. âBasic logistics have been a
shambles,â she adds.  This video can not be played Climate change: 'We're seeing less snow on our Scottish mountains' On Wednesday, we reported that the UK's longest lasting patch of snow in the Highlands of Scotlandhas just disappeared for ""only the eighth time in 300 years"". BBC Young reporter Sofia, who knows that area well, has been looking into the impact of less frequent snowfalls on the hills. She's been talking to people around Aviemore in the Cairngorms to find out their concerns about having less snow and fewer snow days - and what that means for the planet. Matt McGrathEnvironment correspondent The joint statement on ending public financing for fossil fuel overseas,externalmay only have the support of
around 20 countries, but the fact that the US, the UK and Canada are among them
gives it weight. Funding will be removed from
all âunabatedâ oil and gas developments from the end of next year. This means
that there will be no cash for oil, gas and coal projects unless they capture
and bury the CO2 emissions that result from the burning of the fuel. Right now the countries
involved are spending around $18bn (Â£13bn) a year supporting fossil fuels abroad. There are some notable
absentees, though. China, Japan and South Korea are the worldâs biggest
financiers of overseas oil and gas and are not among the signatories. As well as the financing of
fossil fuels, thereâs also been a flurry of announcements here today on coal. While a lot of the talk at COP can feel abstract, the matter of coal is hitting home for one part of the UK. A new coal mine in Cumbria, in north-west England, could bring hundreds of well-paid jobs to the area - if it goes ahead. Right now the decision lies with planning inspectors but could fall into the hands of ministers. Boris Johnson, the UK prime minister, has said he doesn't want it to go ahead, telling COP26 he was""not in favour of more coal"". But Labour, the opposition party, has said the unresolved matter of a new UK coal mine is hampering the government's case at COP. Sir Keir Starmer, Labour party leader, said: ""Our ability to argue on the world stage that we should stop using coal is undermined by the government not, or at least flirting with the idea of opening a coal mine in Cumbria which would be a completely wrong step."" The UK should be moving ahead quickly towards safe, secure forms of energy, like hydrogen and wind, he said in an interview with BBC Radio Two's Jeremy Vine show. Read more on the controversy around the Cumbria coal minehere. Air pollution kills more than seven million people a year, Dr Jeni Miller of the Global Climate and Health Alliance tells the BBC, so phasing out fossil fuels and moving away from coal is a ""fantastic first step"". Climate change is taking its toll on so many of us, physically and mentally, she says, pointing to heatwaves in Canada, wildfires in Australia and flooding in Mexico. She adds that young people's mental health is being affected by the worries around climate change and those caught up in extreme weather were often left with PTSD. If the issue is not tackled, it's a fairly dire scenario, she warns, but if they can be addressed, there are benefits for us all. We've already heard from COP26 president Alok Sharma today and now he is giving a press conference. He says that ""coal is no longer king"" following the pledge by more than 40 countries to phase it out as a fuel. Sharma says that coal financing has ""been well and truly choked off"". But he says that despite the progress ""challenges are emerging"" as negotiators seek to formalise pledges - but he adds ""this is par for the course"". Sharma tells the press conference the transition from coal to clean energy ""must be just"" and says that so far through COP26 around $18bn have been pledged to help deliver this transition.

Yorkshire loses England matches over racism claimsYorkshire is suspended from the right to host England matches following the racism allegations made by former player Azeem Rafiq.,"Headingley held the third Test between England and India this summer Yorkshire have been suspended from hosting England matches as the England and Wales Cricket Board delivered a devastating rebuke over the club's response to racism experienced by former player Azeem Rafiq. An investigation found Rafiq was a victim of ""racial harassment and bullying"" - but the club said it would take no disciplinary action. The ECB board says the ban will last until the club has ""clearly demonstrated that it can meet the standards expected"". Meanwhile, a number of members of the Yorkshire board are set to announce their resignations on Friday before an emergency board meeting, BBC Sport understands. The board is under pressure after criticism from the ECB, sponsors and the UK government over its handling of the Rafiq case. The ECB said it was ""clear"" Yorkshire's handling of the issue was ""wholly unacceptable and is causing serious damage to the reputation of the game"". A statement said: ""Given recent events, it is clear there are serious questions regarding the governance and management of YCCC. ""The club's failure in relation to actions and responses to their own report represent a significant breach of its obligations to the game."" Yorkshire cricket racism scandal - how we got here Yorkshire board calls meeting to discuss racism allegations 'Racist language isn't friendly banter,' say British-Pakistanis The fallout from Yorkshire's response to the racism report intensified on Monday when ESPN Cricinfo reported a racist term about Rafiq's Pakistani heritage was regularly used towards him, but the investigation concluded it was ""friendly and good-natured banter"". Yorkshire's Gary Ballance, who hasadmitted using racist language towards ex-team-mate Rafiq, has been suspended indefinitely from England selection. On Thursday evening, former England captain Michael Vaughanrevealed he was named in the reportbut denied any allegation of racism. Julian Knight MP, who called for the Yorkshire board to resign this week and is chair of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport committee, said he hoped the sanctions handed down by the ECB would ""act as a short, sharp shock to bring the club to its senses"". ""Like the rest of us, I imagine the members of Yorkshire County Cricket Club will be questioning why the board is still in place,"" he added. He said it would have been ""completely unacceptable"" were Ballance still eligible for England. Headingley is due to host a men's Test against New Zealand and a men's one-day international against South Africa in 2022. The Leeds ground is also scheduled to host an Ashes Test against Australia in 2023. Kit suppliers Nike and several sponsors have cut ties with the club. The ECB board has also asked the ECB executive to commission a review, looking into whether of Yorkshire's leadership is fit for purpose. A full ECB investigation into the matter remains ongoing. Financial and further match allocation punishments could be given at the end of the ECB's investigation. Following Thursday's statement, Rafiq, 30, said: ""I need a little time to reflect on what the ECB has said this evening and the actions they're proposing to take. ""I will not be commenting further at this time."" A former England youth captain, Azeem Rafiq played for Yorkshire across two spells and captained the county in a Twenty20 fixture in 2012 Yorkshire's investigations began in September 2020 after Rafiq, who played for Yorkshire between 2008 and 2018, claimed ""institutional racism"" at the club left him close to taking his own life. After more than a year - and having been asked to do so by MPs - Yorkshire released the findings of an independent report in September which upheld seven of the 43 allegations made by Rafiq. But the club said no players, coaches or executives would face disciplinary action following the club's own investigation into the report's findings. That move - and subsequent claim that the report judged the use of a racist term as ""banter - has now led senior politicians, including health secretary Sajid Javid, to criticise the club. Senior Yorkshire officials have been called to attend a DCMS select committee hearing on 16 November, where Rafiq will also give evidence. Ballance, who has not played for England since 2017, said on Wednesday he ""regrets"" using the offensive terms. 2 September 2020:Following aninitial interview with Wisden,external,ESPN Cricinfo publish an article with Rafiq,externalin which he claims ""institutional racism"" at Yorkshire County Cricket Club left him close to taking his own life. 3 September 2020:Yorkshire saythey have launched a ""formal investigation"" into the claims made by Rafiq and chairman Roger Hutton says the club would be carrying out a ""wider review"" of their ""policies and culture"" 5 September 2020:Yorkshire ask an independent law firmto investigate racism allegations against the club by Rafiq. 13 November 2020:Rafiq sayshe hopes to bring about ""meaningful change"" after giving his first statement to the inquiry. 15 December 2020:Rafiq files a legal claimagainst Yorkshire ""claiming direct discrimination and harassment on the grounds of race, as well as victimisation and detriment as a result of trying to address racism at the club"". 2 February 2021:Yorkshire threaten a lifetime banfor anyone found to have made threats against Rafiq or his family and legal team, after ESPN Cricinfo show them messages sent to Rafiq's legal firm. 17 June 2021:An employment tribunal case between Rafiq and his former club Yorkshirefails to find a resolution.The independent investigation into his racism allegations remains ongoing. 16 August 2021:Yorkshire receive the findingsof an independent investigation into the racism allegations and, two days later, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB)asks for a copy. 19 August 2021:Yorkshire, yet to release the findings of the report at this stage,admitRafiq was ""the victim of inappropriate behaviour"" and offer him their ""profound apologies"". Rafiq accuses Yorkshire of downplaying racismby calling him the victim of ""inappropriate behaviour"". 8 September 2021:MPs tell Yorkshireto publish the findingsof the report ""immediately"". 10 September 2021:Yorkshire release the findings of the report,which says Rafiq was the ""victim of racial harassment and bullying"" and seven of the 43 allegations made by the player were upheld by an independent panel. According to Hutton, the report said there was ""insufficient evidence to conclude that Yorkshire County Cricket Club is institutionally racist"". Yorkshire released a summary of the panel's report and recommendations, but said the full report could not be released for legal reasons ""in relation to privacy law and defamation"". 8 October 2021:Yorkshire miss a deadlineto send the full report to Rafiq and his legal team after BBC Sport understands an employment judge ordered the club to release it in full by Friday, 8 October. 13 October 2021:Rafiq then receives a heavily redacted version,while the ECB says it is still awaiting the full report. 28 October 2021:Yorkshire says it carried out its own internal investigation after the findings in the reportand concludedthat ""there is no conduct or action taken by any of its employees, players or executives that warrants disciplinary action"". 2 November 2021:The Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee calls on Hutton to appear before it to answer questions about Yorkshire's handling of a report into Rafiq's allegations of racism. MP Knight, chair of the DCMS select committee,calls on the board of Yorkshire County Cricket Club to resignafter a leaked report emerges apparently containing details of the investigation into the treatment of Rafiq. A story published by ESPN says the report had concluded that a racially offensive term used towards Rafiq was regarded as ""banter"". Knight makes his comments after health secretary Javid calls for ""heads to roll"" at Yorkshire and said if the ECB did not take action ""it's not fit for purpose"". He further states in a Twitter post that the term allegedly used to describe Rafiq was ""not banter"". The ECB announces it will conduct a ""full"" investigation into the situation. 3 November 2021:The date of the DCMS hearing is scheduled for 16 November andRafiq is called to give evidence in person,along with senior Yorkshire officials. Several sponsors, including primary sponsor Emerald Publishing and Yorkshire Tea,end their partnershipswith Yorkshire County Cricket Club. Ballance releases a lengthy statement expressing regret for using a racial slur against former Yorkshire team-mate Rafiq. 4 November 2021:The ECB board suspends Yorkshire from hosting international matches.

Countries vow to move away from fossil fuels,"Coal produced around 37% of the world's electricity in 2019 More than 40 countries have committed to shift away from coal, in pledges made at the COP26 climate summit. Major coal-using countries including Poland, Vietnam and Chile are among those to make the commitment. But some of the world's biggest coal-dependent countries, including China and the US, did not sign up. In a separate commitment, 20 countries, including the US, pledged to end public financing for ""unabated"" fossil fuel projects abroad by the end of 2022. Such projects burn fossil fuels, like coal, oil and natural gas, without using technology to capture the CO2 emissions. Coal is the single biggest contributor to climate change. Signatories to the agreement have committed to ending all investment in new coal power generation domestically and internationally. They have also agreed to phase out coal power in the 2030s for major economies, and the 2040s for poorer nations, the UK said. Dozens of organisations also signed up to the pledge, with several major banks agreeing to stop financing the coal industry. ""The end of coal is in sight,"" UK business and energy secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said. ""The world is moving in the right direction, standing ready to seal coal's fate and embrace the environmental and economic benefits of building a future that is powered by clean energy."" But UK shadow business secretary Ed Miliband said there were ""glaring gaps"" from China and other large emitters, who have not committed to stop increasing coal use domestically. He also noted that there was nothing on the phasing out of oil and gas. Mr Miliband said the UK government ""has let others off the hook"". Tap or click to go through the gallery  Although progress has been made in reducing coal use globally, it still produced around 37% of the world's electricity in 2019. Countries like South Africa, Poland and India will need major investments to make their energy sectors cleaner. Juan Pablo Osornio, head of Greenpeace's delegation at COP26, said: ""Overall this statement still falls well short of the ambition needed on fossil fuels in this critical decade."" ""The small print seemingly gives countries enormous leeway to pick their own phase-out date, despite the shiny headline,"" he added. There's been such a flurry of announcements on the world's most polluting fossil fuel, that it's hard to see the light for all the (coal) dust. There are many questions outstanding. One of the biggest is the list of countries missing from this bonfire of coal commitments - including the US, China and India. The time scales for phase-out are also a bit woolly - with richer countries promising to end coal by the 2030s, with developing nations in the 2040s. None of these commitments are binding - again there is no big stick to force countries to do this. And how many of the plans to stop using coal in developing countries will need financial support from the developed world? We've already seen the UK, Germany and the US step up to pay South Africa's $8.5bn (Â£6.2bn) to move away from coal. Other countries are said to be interested in following in South Africa's footsteps. So is there also a question of the rich countries paying others to do what they struggle to do at home? While the US was notably absent from the coal commitments, it joined 19 other countries - including the UK, Canada and New Zealand - in pledging to stop financing unabated overseas fossil fuel projects. ""Investing in unabated fossil-related energy projects increasingly entails both social and economic risksâ¦ and has ensuing negative impacts on government revenue, local employment, taxpayers, utility ratepayers and public health,"" the signatories of the UK-led initiative said in a joint statement. The deal saw countries and financial institutions vow to steer their spending into clean energy instead. It allowed for exemptions in unspecified ""limited"" circumstances, but said these must be consistent with efforts to limit global temperature rises to 1.5C. ""Ending international finance for all unabated fossil fuels is the next critical frontier we must deliver on,"" UK energy minister Greg Hands said. ""We must put public finance on the right side of history."" However, major financers of such projects, such as China, Japan and South Korea, did not sign up. The countries did join G20 nations last month in agreeing to end financial support for new unabated coal plants overseas.

The former coal villages turning green,"Much of the Amman Valley industrial area is now green As fossil fuels are phased out across the world, the question on many people's minds is what should replace them. One former coal mining community has been busy looking for solutions. Renewable energy projects are now taking the place of carbon in parts of Carmarthenshire's Amman Valley. And there are calls to ensure these schemes remain community-owned, so profits stay in Wales. For decades Welsh communities like this one exported millions of tonnes of coal across the world, but things have moved on. Dan McCallum runs community energy charity Awel Aman Tawe, set up in 1998. 'We have to look to the future', said Dan McCallum ""It is not about feeling guilty about the past. Yes this area has produced a lot of coal which has caused pollution, but we have to look to the future,"" he said. How can I reduce my carbon footprint?

It used to be coal and now it's renewable energy, whether from wind energy or solar panels. ""So now we have solar panels on local buildings like Cwmgors rugby club. People see that transition naturally."" 'It's important to create a greener future in the area,' says renewable energy company Awel Aman Tawe The charity works with schools and community groups to raise awareness and help people reduce their carbon footprint. ""I would like to see as much of our energy as possible in the future being community-owned so the income from that energy stays in Wales,"" said Mr McCallum. ""We have great examples of this already. Look atYnni Ogwen, in north Wales,externaland their work with community-owned hydro (power)."" By keeping assets and resources in Wales, jobs could be created that could help young people in the area, Mr McCallum said. Coal was a way of life for many small communities in Wales, said Dr John Evans Despite these developments, local historian and former miner, Dr John Dorian Evans, believes the role coal played in many Welsh communities should not be forgotten. ""It's important to remember the effort people went through to produce the coal, men and women, and our culture was based on the coal industry,"" he said. ""It was a way of life. Nearly every house in the street I lived on had a miner in it. The conversations were about coal and the production of coal or wages paid by the National Coal Board. ""In Ammanford we have a miners hall. Miners donated from their wages each week to create these buildings and they were centres for their communities. Dr Evans believes the rising cost of gas proves the need for a mix of energy sources to meet the UK's energy requirements, including investment in carbon capture and storage as well as biomass fuels. Miners march on the last day of Betws colliery in 2003 Former miner Terry Pugh is passionate about the need for change and feels more help needs to be given to support ""green ventures"". ""We need to turn this industrial area into a green valley. It is a giant step but a necessary step,"" he said. ""We need to change the way we behave as a society to make the world a cleaner and better place. ""We would be further ahead if there was more grants and more laws to move on. There are so many things we could be doing in this country that aren't being done and need to be done desperately before it is too late.""

LiveLiveCOP26 promises could limit global warming to 1.8C9 minutes ago,"Promises made at COP26 - if fully kept - would limit global warming to 1.8C, says the influential International Energy Agency It comes on day five of the global climate summit - the focus is on how the world can move away from fossil fuels More than 40 countries commit to shifting away from coal but huge users and producers like China, India, Australia and the US don't sign up Indonesia signals it may pull back from a pledge made this week on reversing deforestation COP26 president Alok Sharma says the ""end of coal is in sight"" but more work needs to be done Activist Greta Thunberg is scornful of COP26's inclusivity, calling it the ""Great North greenwash festival"" Edited by Paul Gribben Thank you for joining us for today's rolling coverage of COP26. It was edited by Paul Gribben. Our writers were Doug Faulkner, Bryn Palmer, Kelly-Leigh Cooper and Marie Jackson We'll be back again tomorrow - when the day's theme is youth and public empowerment. As young protesters gather in Glasgow, we will be hearing
directly from inspirational activists and young people already experiencing the
effects of climate change. And we'll be joined by Maisie and Nel, two BBC Young Reporters who will be with us as special guest journalists for the day. Here's a reminder of what has been happening today at COP26 - where there has been a focus on energy. A ship supplies feed to a salmon farm on the west coast of Scotland Chris Packham, the environmental campaigner and presenter of the BBC's Springwatch series, has visited COP26 and says the host country should ""get rid of highly polluting, nasty salmon farms"". The industry is said to be worth more than Â£1bn a year to the economy, with hundreds of thousands of fish raised in pens suspended in the open sea lochs around Scotland's west coast and the Northern Isles. The pens keep the fish - fed on processed feed - enclosed but they allow parasites to get in, with thousands of tonnes of waste getting into the surrounding water. Asked what more Scotland could be doing in the fight against climate change, Packham toldBBC Radio Scotland's Drivetimeprogramme that ""there are obviously elephants in
the room while there are salmon in those cages off the west coast"". He called for the industry to be ""transitioned out"" with investment so that people can be ""retrained into jobs that are far more harmonious and
sustainable"". Sameer HashmiMiddle East Business Correspondent Last month, Saudi Arabiaâs crown prince and de facto ruler,
Mohammed bin Salman, announced that the country had seta target of achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2060. For a long time, the worldâs largest oil exporter had
resisted calls from Western countries to set a definite target to reduce carbon
emissions. But, even as the Saudis seek to achieve that target, they are
boosting their oil production capacity to cater to global demand. The countryâs top officials have repeatedly said that
tackling climate change is necessary, but that it cannot be done by âdemonisingâ
hydrocarbons. The energy minister believes that the world needs both fossil
fuels as well as renewables. On the face of it, the kingdom has set an ambitious plan to
eliminate 278 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions per year by 2030, up
from a previous target of 130 million tonnes. It would involve investments of
$190bn (Â£139bn) during that period. But the task is not going to be easy. Saudi Arabia earns
more than half of its revenue from oil exports. Although the crown prince is
trying to promote economic diversification by investing in new industries, it is
going to take time for them to start contributing substantially to the economy. Google tells us that a lot of people seem to be searching online to find out when COP26 finishes. Well, there's quite a while left yet. Today is the fifth day of the conference, which will run up until Friday, 12 November. (But if previous COPs are any guide negotiations might carry on into the weekend.) Each day has a different theme with today's focus being energy and the transition to greener economies. All countries face problems getting their emissions down but China has the biggest challenge. Per person,China's emissions are about half those of the US, but its huge 1.4 billion population and explosive economic growth have pushed it way ahead of any other country in its overall emissions. While more than 130 countries have pledged to reach net zero emissions before 2050, China has said it's aiming for""carbon neutrality"" by 2060. It hasn't set out exactly what this means or how it will get there. Russiahas also pledged to reach net zero by 2060, although its draft commitment hasn't been legally ratified. Until recently President Vladimir Putin dismissed the risks posed by rising temperatures. Indiaset a net zero target for the first time at COP26, with a promise to cut emissions to net zero by 2070.  Vanessa Nakate (right) met Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon alongside Greta Thunberg earlier this week There is a focus on youth at COP26 on Friday - ahead of that, some activists have been speaking today at a New York Times fringe event. Nobel Peace Prize winner Malala Yousafzai and fellow campaigners Vanessa Nakate and Leah Thomas called for world leaders to listen to marginalised women and people of colour who are on the front line of the climate crisis. Yousafzai, a Pakistani education activist, said environmental catastrophes, including droughts and floods, affected education and so were not separate issues. Speaking via video-link she said: ""The consequences of climate change are not equal. Some of us are more vulnerable to the climate disasters than others."" Nakate, a climate activist from Uganda, said she does not accept that praise for young campaigners from politicians is genuine. ""They're are making us responsible - if it doesn't go well, then we failed to do it,"" she said, adding that she was putting the responsibility back on them. Kakembo's project transforms biodegradable plastics and organic waste into eco-friendly charcoal briquettes  BBC Minutehas been speaking to Kakembo Galabuzi Brian, a
young entrepreneur from Uganda whoâs at COP26 calling for more investment in
clean energy projects in developing nations. ""We need to present the community with better solutions,"" the 27-year-old says. ""Itâs very important to do it now before all the
resources run out and the Earth suffers."" His youth-focused project turns farm waste into fuel used for cooking - trying to ""replace firewood, so
we can keep the trees standing"". Kakemboâs eco-friendly work earned him the accolade of
Commonwealth Young Person of the Year in 2020. He argues that itâs hypocritical for wealthy nations to
expect poorer ones to switch to green energy sources unless they curb their own
use of fossil fuels - and offer a helping hand. âThere is no way you can tell the Ugandan government not to
explore oil unless you give them an incentive not to. So climate finance is a
really big deal for us.â We mentioned earlier aboutcriticism of the organisation and inclusivity of the COP26. Now Greta Thunberg, arguably the most well-known climate activist in the world, is doubling down on her criticism of the event. She describes the conference as the ""Great North greenwash festival"" in a tweet on Thursday. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Helen BriggsBBC environment correspondent in Glasgow Suggestions that warming could be limited to slightly under
2C if countries were to fully deliver on their commitments to reduce emissions should be treated with caution, according to two leading climate
experts. Number-crunching of revised pledges made in the run-up to
Glasgow suggest these could put the world on track to limit global warming to
1.8 or 1.9C. But Dr Carl Schleussner, of Climate Analytics, says even
under the most âoptimisticâ scenarios, governments are not yet delivering in
terms of âclosing the gap in the near termâ. And Prof Simon Lewis, of UCL, says with some targets for
peaking emissions set so far into the future, governments' commitments âneed to
be taken with a pinch of saltâ. The UN recently predicted that the world was heading for a
temperature rise of 2.7C, based on an analysis of pledges made for 2030,
excluding those in recent days. If you include net zero commitments made by
some countries from 2050 onwards, this falls to 2.2C. The predictions by the IEA and by a group of scientists in
Australia are based on revised emission plans that have come in recently from a
number of countries, including India, which aims to peak emissions in 2070. Thursday marks day five of the UN climate conference in Glasgow. Here are some images of the week so far: The climate conference got under way on Sunday, with world leaders among thousands travelling to Glasgow British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he remains ""cautiously optimistic"" about a deal to keep global temperature rise below 1.5C Prince Charles is among the attendees, seen here at an event with fashion designer and sustainability advocate Stella McCartney Climate activists - including Extinction Rebellion - have been protesting on the side of the summit There have also been less traditional demonstrations spotted on the sidelines too - including a group dressed up as Pokemon character Pikachu trying to encourage Japan to move away from coal Rebecca HenschkeAsia editor, BBC World Service When Indonesia, home to some of the worldâs most carbon-rich
forests and peatlands, signed up to a deal to halt and reverse deforestation, it
was seen as a significant step forward. But now the country's environment and forestry minister Siti
Nurbaya Bakar has released a statement onsocial
media,externalsaying that Indonesia ""canât promise what we canât do"". She said forcing Indonesia to commit to ""zero deforestation
in 2030 is clearly inappropriate and unfair"".  Despite President Joko
Widodo signing the forest deal, she said that development remained the
countryâs top priority. Minister Nurbaya argued that the countryâs vast natural
resources must be used for the benefit of its people and cited the need to cut
down forests to make way for roads.  Deforestation of Indonesia's peatland forests also threaten populations like orangutans Controversial road projects in remote areas of Borneo and Papua have opened up previously untouched rainforest and lead to a spike in illegal logging. Indonesians have responded negatively to the minister's social posts commenting that itâs often big businesses that profit off deforestation while local people are left to deal with floods and landslides. One user wrote: ""Letâs destroy all the forests, to get money minister. Then we might have money to pay for oxygen.â Ashitha NageshBBC News, London You might not think of climate protests as all-singing all-dancing - but for one activist group, thatâs exactly what they are. The group, BP or Not BP, specifically protest against oil companies giving large donations and sponsorships to cultural institutions like galleries, museums and theatres - something they say is a way for oil companies to enhance their reputations. Their first protest almost 10 years ago, in April 2012, was at the Royal Shakespeare Company. Since then theyâve done 62 ""protest-performances"" - including wheeling a large Trojan horse into the lobby of the British Museum for the museumâs Troy exhibition in February 2020. And in that time, several institutions have ended their relationships with oil companies - including Tate, the British Film Institute and the Royal Shakespeare Company. BP boss Bernard Looney responded to the protests last year when he set out an ambition for the oil company to ""reimagine energy"". âMany
question our motives in supporting the arts,"" he said. ""I get that. ""We are taking steps
to more firmly and visibly align our intentions with our actions and become
much more transparent.â Adam EastonWarsaw Correspondent A number of solar panels attached to the wall of an old house in the centre of Krakow As we reported earlier, Poland has pledged to phase out coal by the end of the 2040s,
reaffirming last yearâs agreement with trade unions to close down the last pit
by 2049. The countryâs abundant Silesian coal reserves have long fuelled the
economy and generate around 80 per cent of its electricity. But Polish power
generators must now pay for their CO2 emissions, and rising carbon costs have
rendered many plants unprofitable. After years of defiantly championing
its black treasure, Poland is now investing in renewable energy, particularly
offshore wind, and seeking EU funds to gradually close down its mines and
retrain its workers. The country now has
one of the fastest growing solar energy markets in the EU, largely due to
homeowners like Michal Dera. He replaced his
electric heating system at his home in Bedzin near one of Silesiaâs coal-fired
power plants with a heat pump and installed solar panels to generate
electricity. I made the change to have a heating system that produced fewer emissions as well as save money. We use electricity for heating the house, charging cars, cooking, lighting and other household needs. At current electricity prices the investment should pay off in 8-10 years.â Michal Dera Helen BriggsBBC environment correspondent in Glasgow Organisation of the Glasgow summit has drawn complaints,
with grumbling over the long queues to get in and restrictions for observers
following the negotiations. âThe worst COP ever,â said one COP veteran, Kenyan
policy expert Mohamed Adow. Some even went as far as to invoke the spectre of
Copenhagen, the climate talks that ended in disaster in 2009, haunted by images
of delegates queuing outside in the snow. On my journey through the Blue Zone,
my fellow queuers were fairly sanguine. Austin, from Edinburgh, had anticipated queues and felt things were running smoothly. Inside, a member of Ghanaâs
delegation blamed the queues on strict security due to Covid, while a delegate
from Tanzania said she was more concerned over restrictions that limit the
number of people from each country attending meetings. Others are less
sympathetic. Dr Kat Kramer, Christian Aidâs climate lead, with 10 COPs under
her belt, calls this the âleast inclusiveâ COP ever. She says restrictions on
civil society observers following the negotiations needs to be fixed âto
ensure vulnerable communities on the frontline of this crisis are fully
representedâ. And thereâs not enough seating or power points, she says,
and much longer queues than previous summits. âBasic logistics have been a
shambles,â she adds.  This video can not be played Climate change: 'We're seeing less snow on our Scottish mountains' On Wednesday, we reported that the UK's longest lasting patch of snow in the Highlands of Scotlandhas just disappeared for ""only the eighth time in 300 years"". BBC Young reporter Sofia, who knows that area well, has been looking into the impact of less frequent snowfalls on the hills. She's been talking to people around Aviemore in the Cairngorms to find out their concerns about having less snow and fewer snow days - and what that means for the planet. Matt McGrathEnvironment correspondent The joint statement on ending public financing for fossil fuel overseas,externalmay only have the support of
around 20 countries, but the fact that the US, the UK and Canada are among them
gives it weight. Funding will be removed from
all âunabatedâ oil and gas developments from the end of next year. This means
that there will be no cash for oil, gas and coal projects unless they capture
and bury the CO2 emissions that result from the burning of the fuel. Right now the countries
involved are spending around $18bn (Â£13bn) a year supporting fossil fuels abroad. There are some notable
absentees, though. China, Japan and South Korea are the worldâs biggest
financiers of overseas oil and gas and are not among the signatories. As well as the financing of
fossil fuels, thereâs also been a flurry of announcements here today on coal. While a lot of the talk at COP can feel abstract, the matter of coal is hitting home for one part of the UK. A new coal mine in Cumbria, in north-west England, could bring hundreds of well-paid jobs to the area - if it goes ahead. Right now the decision lies with planning inspectors but could fall into the hands of ministers. Boris Johnson, the UK prime minister, has said he doesn't want it to go ahead, telling COP26 he was""not in favour of more coal"". But Labour, the opposition party, has said the unresolved matter of a new UK coal mine is hampering the government's case at COP. Sir Keir Starmer, Labour party leader, said: ""Our ability to argue on the world stage that we should stop using coal is undermined by the government not, or at least flirting with the idea of opening a coal mine in Cumbria which would be a completely wrong step."" The UK should be moving ahead quickly towards safe, secure forms of energy, like hydrogen and wind, he said in an interview with BBC Radio Two's Jeremy Vine show. Read more on the controversy around the Cumbria coal minehere. Air pollution kills more than seven million people a year, Dr Jeni Miller of the Global Climate and Health Alliance tells the BBC, so phasing out fossil fuels and moving away from coal is a ""fantastic first step"". Climate change is taking its toll on so many of us, physically and mentally, she says, pointing to heatwaves in Canada, wildfires in Australia and flooding in Mexico. She adds that young people's mental health is being affected by the worries around climate change and those caught up in extreme weather were often left with PTSD. If the issue is not tackled, it's a fairly dire scenario, she warns, but if they can be addressed, there are benefits for us all. We've already heard from COP26 president Alok Sharma today and now he is giving a press conference. He says that ""coal is no longer king"" following the pledge by more than 40 countries to phase it out as a fuel. Sharma says that coal financing has ""been well and truly choked off"". But he says that despite the progress ""challenges are emerging"" as negotiators seek to formalise pledges - but he adds ""this is par for the course"". Sharma tells the press conference the transition from coal to clean energy ""must be just"" and says that so far through COP26 around $18bn have been pledged to help deliver this transition.

Farmer's fury over Â£15k tree planting scheme fine,"David Mills planted trees as part of a government scheme, but was fined after being told some were in the wrong place A farmer said he was given a Â£15,000 fine after some of the trees he planted in a Welsh government scheme were in the wrong place - some by a few inches. David Mills, from Lower Chapel, Powys, decided to plant 13,000 trees on 20 acres of his land as part of the Glastir Woodland Creation scheme. Earlier this year, Mr Mills was told he had contravened the original plans. The Welsh government said it could not comment on a case which was subject to an appeal. It added it had a ""statutory obligation"" to enforce the rules, but it was reviewing the current rules of the scheme. Mr Mills's farm is in the heart of the Brecon Beacons Mr Mills said he felt like he had ""done his bit"" to encourage biodiversity on his farm and tackle climate change when he planted the trees. But he received a letter from Rural Payments Wales telling him he had contravened original plans - using satellite images as evidence - and that he faced a Â£15,000 fine. Climate change in Wales in charts Tiny forest of 600 trees to tackle climate change He said: ""We'd planted the right number of trees, I'd got someone from Welsh government to plan and draw up all the diagrams. He organised the planting and a contractor did the fencing. ""I just assumed everything was correct. It's a ridiculous situation."" He said he had to borrow money from his son to pay the fine straight away, as it was accruing heavy interest, and that he had been unsuccessful in an appeal. He said Rural Payments Wales told him the tree planting differed from the original plan, in some cases by as little as 10cm (4in). Mr Mills has planted 13,000 trees on his 156-acre farm ""It's been horrific,"" Mr Mills added. ""I feel like I've been tricked and cheated, and the hypocrisy when you see someone [from Welsh government] saying 'we want to plant more trees' and this is the way I'm treated for doing what I thought was environmentally friendly. ""I want to increase biodiversity - I'm not doing it for any other reason other than I care."" Mr Mills said farmers should be supported, rather than penalised, for planting trees and maintaining them. He said: ""I would have expected a pat on the back, but instead of that I get a Â£15,000 fine."" His appeal has been supported by National Farmers' Union (NFU) Cymru, which said it is representing two other farms in similar situations but facing even higher fines. Stella Owen, from NFU Cymru, said fines for farmers trying to do the right thing would put people off tree planting Stella Owen, a county adviser, said she was concerned about the reputational damage to the tree planting scheme. She said it was not just about the financial penalty as farmers found it ""scarring"" to have committed to the scheme and then feel like they have failed. ""That's no help to anybody, that doesn't deliver the aspirations of what Welsh government want,"" she added. ""That doesn't do anything for the mental health of the farmer and to all intents and purposes, it will just put people off. ""If they want that uptake, then there has to be more leniency in terms of a simple, robust scheme which can allow changes. ""There is absolutely no need for this level of financial penalty to be imposed five years down the line."" The scheme was launched in 2015 with the aim of combating climate change, increasing biodiversity and establishing habitats for wildlife. Farmers were offered grants to plant trees and payments to maintain them over 12 years, which feed into plans for aNational Forest for Wales. The Welsh government said: ""Contracts can be verified by on-farm visits or the use of latest available aerial imagery. ""When the scheme verification shows the conditions of the contract have not been met, the Welsh government has a statutory obligation to apply European Commission rules concerning the recovery of payments and application of over-declaration penalties. ""We are committed to supporting farmers to create more woodland in order to tackle climate change.""

Bank of England hints at future interest rate rise,"The Bank of England has signalled it will raise interest rates in ""coming months"" in response to high inflation, but held off on an immediate increase. On Thursday, Bank policymakers voted 7-2 in favour of no change from the current record low rate of 0.1%. Bank governor Andrew Bailey said the decision had been a ""close call"". The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) said there was ""value"" in waiting to see how the jobs market coped with the end of the furlough scheme. However, it did not rule out a rate rise at its next meeting in December. The MPC meets every six weeks. When pressed on when a rate rise might come, Mr Bailey said: ""From now onwards."" He said the MPC had ""spent many hours"" pondering its decision, adding: ""The calls are close, they are quite hard. It's a reflection of the position we're in."" In a BBC interview, Mr Bailey said current conditions were different because inflation was being caused by global ""supply shocks"" rather than demand pressure in the UK economy. ""Putting interest rates up, I'm afraid, isn't going to get us more gas,"" he added. But he said that interest rates were not going to return to levels seen before the 2008 financial crisis. ""For the foreseeable future, we're in a world of low interest rates,"" he said. ""That doesn't mean that they don't rise and fall within that sort of bound. But I want to be quite clear, we're not signalling that there's going to be some very sharp return to the world that we can just about remember before the financial crisis."" Mr Bailey said the MPC wanted to see ""more evidence"" of how the labour market was evolving before raising interest rates. However, he stressed: ""We think there will be some need to increase interest rates to bring inflation sustainably back to target. And we will be ready to do that."" How do interest rates affect your money? Why is the cost of living going up? While the MPC voted to keep interest rates on hold, policymakers were split on the decision. Two of the nine members, Dave Ramsden and Michael Saunders, voted to raise rates immediately to 0.25%. Rates were cut to their current level in March last year in response to the effects of the coronavirus pandemic. But the reopening of the economy has fuelled price rises, prompting expectations that the Bank would increase borrowing costs. Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said the decision to hold the interest rate at 0.1% was a ""close call"" The pound fell by nearly 1% against the dollar to $1.3556 following the Bank's decision, reflecting the fact that investors had bet on a rate rise. Financial markets expect the interest rate to hit 1% by the end of next year. Electricity and gas prices have surged as the global economy reopens. Factories and businesses are also struggling with staff shortages and a backlog of orders, which has also pushed up prices. The Bank expects inflation to peak at 5% next April, up from 3.1% in September. This would be the highest rate in more than a decade and far higher than the Bank's target of 2%. The Bank said households faced ""substantially"" higher energy bills next year. Policymakers also said food prices were likely to rise in the run-up to Christmas. However, they added that the sharp increase in inflation was expected to be ""temporary"", with price rises expected to ease back towards 2% in the second half of next year. Higher inflation is expected to put pressure on household finances for the next two years. The Bank's latest Monetary Policy Report expects price rises to outpace pay increases in 2022 and 2023. So-called real incomes are expected to barely grow in 2024. High Street banks use the interest rate set by the Bank's MPC to set their own mortgages and savings rates. While an increase in interest rates would have been bad news for borrowers, many mortgage holders would not have faced an immediate increase in payments. Three quarters of mortgage holders are currently on fixed-rate deals. Higher prices are expected to weigh on growth in the near term. The Bank now expects the economy to grow by 1.5% in the three months to September. This is almost half the rate expected at its previous forecast in August. As a result, the economy is not expected to get back to its pre-pandemic size until the start of next year. It had previously expected the economy to recover by the end of 2021. The Bank also cut its forecast for annual growth in 2021 and 2022 to 7% and 5% respectively, down from 7.25% and 6% previously. In September, around a million workers were still on the government's furlough scheme that subsidised wages. The scheme ended in October and the Bank expects most of those who were on furlough to return to work. While the peak in inflation next April is expected at a time when around 40% of workers are negotiating pay deals, the Bank does not expect higher prices to lead to big demands for pay rises. It suggested that many workers were still scarred by the financial crisis, when many accepted slow pay growth or wage freezes even amid rising inflation. Be in no doubt, people and businesses should prepare for rates rising in the coming months, perhaps as high as 1% from their record lows of 0.1%, but not precisely this month. The message from the Bank of England is that the economy has been hit by supply chain bottlenecks, both for goods and workers, pushing back the time when the economy regains all the lost pandemic growth into early next year. And while the inflation picture is now worse, with a forecast peak of 5% when the energy price cap is due to be further increased in April 2022, there is not much the Bank thinks it can do about the global drivers of this. Where the Bank can act is around the persistence of this inflation into 2023 and 2024. They do now feel there is a risk that pressures from rising prices last. If interest rates were kept at these emergency lows, the Bank forecasts inflation would still be about 3% in late 2024. But acting now would have required immediate evidence of a spiral in wage rises across the economy. On balance, the members of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee want to see official data in a fortnight on the impact of the end of the furlough scheme on the jobs market.

It was edited by Paul Gribben. Our writers were Doug Faulkner, Bryn Palmer, Kelly-Leigh Cooper and Marie Jackson We'll be back again tomorrow - when the day's theme is youth and public empowerment. As young protesters gather in Glasgow, we will be hearing
directly from inspirational activists and young people already experiencing the
effects of climate change. And we'll be joined by Maisie and Nel, two BBC Young Reporters who will be with us as special guest journalists for the day. Here's a reminder of what has been happening today at COP26 - where there has been a focus on energy. A ship supplies feed to a salmon farm on the west coast of Scotland Chris Packham, the environmental campaigner and presenter of the BBC's Springwatch series, has visited COP26 and says the host country should ""get rid of highly polluting, nasty salmon farms"". The industry is said to be worth more than Â£1bn a year to the economy, with hundreds of thousands of fish raised in pens suspended in the open sea lochs around Scotland's west coast and the Northern Isles. The pens keep the fish - fed on processed feed - enclosed but they allow parasites to get in, with thousands of tonnes of waste getting into the surrounding water. Asked what more Scotland could be doing in the fight against climate change, Packham toldBBC Radio Scotland's Drivetimeprogramme that ""there are obviously elephants in
the room while there are salmon in those cages off the west coast"". He called for the industry to be ""transitioned out"" with investment so that people can be ""retrained into jobs that are far more harmonious and
sustainable"". Sameer HashmiMiddle East Business Correspondent Last month, Saudi Arabiaâs crown prince and de facto ruler,
Mohammed bin Salman, announced that the country had seta target of achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2060. For a long time, the worldâs largest oil exporter had
resisted calls from Western countries to set a definite target to reduce carbon
emissions. But, even as the Saudis seek to achieve that target, they are
boosting their oil production capacity to cater to global demand. The countryâs top officials have repeatedly said that
tackling climate change is necessary, but that it cannot be done by âdemonisingâ
hydrocarbons. The energy minister believes that the world needs both fossil
fuels as well as renewables. On the face of it, the kingdom has set an ambitious plan to
eliminate 278 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions per year by 2030, up
from a previous target of 130 million tonnes. It would involve investments of
$190bn (Â£139bn) during that period. But the task is not going to be easy. Saudi Arabia earns
more than half of its revenue from oil exports. Although the crown prince is
trying to promote economic diversification by investing in new industries, it is
going to take time for them to start contributing substantially to the economy. Google tells us that a lot of people seem to be searching online to find out when COP26 finishes. Well, there's quite a while left yet. Today is the fifth day of the conference, which will run up until Friday, 12 November. (But if previous COPs are any guide negotiations might carry on into the weekend.) Each day has a different theme with today's focus being energy and the transition to greener economies. All countries face problems getting their emissions down but China has the biggest challenge. Per person,China's emissions are about half those of the US, but its huge 1.4 billion population and explosive economic growth have pushed it way ahead of any other country in its overall emissions. While more than 130 countries have pledged to reach net zero emissions before 2050, China has said it's aiming for""carbon neutrality"" by 2060. It hasn't set out exactly what this means or how it will get there. Russiahas also pledged to reach net zero by 2060, although its draft commitment hasn't been legally ratified. Until recently President Vladimir Putin dismissed the risks posed by rising temperatures. Indiaset a net zero target for the first time at COP26, with a promise to cut emissions to net zero by 2070.  Vanessa Nakate (right) met Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon alongside Greta Thunberg earlier this week There is a focus on youth at COP26 on Friday - ahead of that, some activists have been speaking today at a New York Times fringe event. Nobel Peace Prize winner Malala Yousafzai and fellow campaigners Vanessa Nakate and Leah Thomas called for world leaders to listen to marginalised women and people of colour who are on the front line of the climate crisis. Yousafzai, a Pakistani education activist, said environmental catastrophes, including droughts and floods, affected education and so were not separate issues. Speaking via video-link she said: ""The consequences of climate change are not equal. Some of us are more vulnerable to the climate disasters than others."" Nakate, a climate activist from Uganda, said she does not accept that praise for young campaigners from politicians is genuine. ""They're are making us responsible - if it doesn't go well, then we failed to do it,"" she said, adding that she was putting the responsibility back on them. Kakembo's project transforms biodegradable plastics and organic waste into eco-friendly charcoal briquettes  BBC Minutehas been speaking to Kakembo Galabuzi Brian, a
young entrepreneur from Uganda whoâs at COP26 calling for more investment in
clean energy projects in developing nations. ""We need to present the community with better solutions,"" the 27-year-old says. ""Itâs very important to do it now before all the
resources run out and the Earth suffers."" His youth-focused project turns farm waste into fuel used for cooking - trying to ""replace firewood, so
we can keep the trees standing"". Kakemboâs eco-friendly work earned him the accolade of
Commonwealth Young Person of the Year in 2020. He argues that itâs hypocritical for wealthy nations to
expect poorer ones to switch to green energy sources unless they curb their own
use of fossil fuels - and offer a helping hand. âThere is no way you can tell the Ugandan government not to
explore oil unless you give them an incentive not to. So climate finance is a
really big deal for us.â We mentioned earlier aboutcriticism of the organisation and inclusivity of the COP26. Now Greta Thunberg, arguably the most well-known climate activist in the world, is doubling down on her criticism of the event.

Helen BriggsBBC environment correspondent in Glasgow Suggestions that warming could be limited to slightly under
2C if countries were to fully deliver on their commitments to reduce emissions should be treated with caution, according to two leading climate
experts. Number-crunching of revised pledges made in the run-up to
Glasgow suggest these could put the world on track to limit global warming to
1.8 or 1.9C. But Dr Carl Schleussner, of Climate Analytics, says even
under the most âoptimisticâ scenarios, governments are not yet delivering in
terms of âclosing the gap in the near termâ. And Prof Simon Lewis, of UCL, says with some targets for
peaking emissions set so far into the future, governments' commitments âneed to
be taken with a pinch of saltâ. The UN recently predicted that the world was heading for a
temperature rise of 2.7C, based on an analysis of pledges made for 2030,
excluding those in recent days. If you include net zero commitments made by
some countries from 2050 onwards, this falls to 2.2C. The predictions by the IEA and by a group of scientists in
Australia are based on revised emission plans that have come in recently from a
number of countries, including India, which aims to peak emissions in 2070. Thursday marks day five of the UN climate conference in Glasgow. Here are some images of the week so far: The climate conference got under way on Sunday, with world leaders among thousands travelling to Glasgow British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he remains ""cautiously optimistic"" about a deal to keep global temperature rise below 1.5C Prince Charles is among the attendees, seen here at an event with fashion designer and sustainability advocate Stella McCartney Climate activists - including Extinction Rebellion - have been protesting on the side of the summit There have also been less traditional demonstrations spotted on the sidelines too - including a group dressed up as Pokemon character Pikachu trying to encourage Japan to move away from coal Rebecca HenschkeAsia editor, BBC World Service When Indonesia, home to some of the worldâs most carbon-rich
forests and peatlands, signed up to a deal to halt and reverse deforestation, it
was seen as a significant step forward. But now the country's environment and forestry minister Siti
Nurbaya Bakar has released a statement onsocial
media,externalsaying that Indonesia ""canât promise what we canât do"". She said forcing Indonesia to commit to ""zero deforestation
in 2030 is clearly inappropriate and unfair"".  Despite President Joko
Widodo signing the forest deal, she said that development remained the
countryâs top priority. Minister Nurbaya argued that the countryâs vast natural
resources must be used for the benefit of its people and cited the need to cut
down forests to make way for roads.  Deforestation of Indonesia's peatland forests also threaten populations like orangutans Controversial road projects in remote areas of Borneo and Papua have opened up previously untouched rainforest and lead to a spike in illegal logging. Indonesians have responded negatively to the minister's social posts commenting that itâs often big businesses that profit off deforestation while local people are left to deal with floods and landslides. One user wrote: ""Letâs destroy all the forests, to get money minister. Then we might have money to pay for oxygen.â Ashitha NageshBBC News, London You might not think of climate protests as all-singing all-dancing - but for one activist group, thatâs exactly what they are. The group, BP or Not BP, specifically protest against oil companies giving large donations and sponsorships to cultural institutions like galleries, museums and theatres - something they say is a way for oil companies to enhance their reputations. Their first protest almost 10 years ago, in April 2012, was at the Royal Shakespeare Company. Since then theyâve done 62 ""protest-performances"" - including wheeling a large Trojan horse into the lobby of the British Museum for the museumâs Troy exhibition in February 2020. And in that time, several institutions have ended their relationships with oil companies - including Tate, the British Film Institute and the Royal Shakespeare Company. BP boss Bernard Looney responded to the protests last year when he set out an ambition for the oil company to ""reimagine energy"". âMany
question our motives in supporting the arts,"" he said. ""I get that. ""We are taking steps
to more firmly and visibly align our intentions with our actions and become
much more transparent.â Adam EastonWarsaw Correspondent A number of solar panels attached to the wall of an old house in the centre of Krakow As we reported earlier, Poland has pledged to phase out coal by the end of the 2040s,
reaffirming last yearâs agreement with trade unions to close down the last pit
by 2049. The countryâs abundant Silesian coal reserves have long fuelled the
economy and generate around 80 per cent of its electricity. But Polish power
generators must now pay for their CO2 emissions, and rising carbon costs have
rendered many plants unprofitable. After years of defiantly championing
its black treasure, Poland is now investing in renewable energy, particularly
offshore wind, and seeking EU funds to gradually close down its mines and
retrain its workers. The country now has
one of the fastest growing solar energy markets in the EU, largely due to
homeowners like Michal Dera. He replaced his
electric heating system at his home in Bedzin near one of Silesiaâs coal-fired
power plants with a heat pump and installed solar panels to generate
electricity. I made the change to have a heating system that produced fewer emissions as well as save money. We use electricity for heating the house, charging cars, cooking, lighting and other household needs. At current electricity prices the investment should pay off in 8-10 years.â Michal Dera Helen BriggsBBC environment correspondent in Glasgow Organisation of the Glasgow summit has drawn complaints,
with grumbling over the long queues to get in and restrictions for observers
following the negotiations. âThe worst COP ever,â said one COP veteran, Kenyan
policy expert Mohamed Adow. Some even went as far as to invoke the spectre of
Copenhagen, the climate talks that ended in disaster in 2009, haunted by images
of delegates queuing outside in the snow. On my journey through the Blue Zone,
my fellow queuers were fairly sanguine. Austin, from Edinburgh, had anticipated queues and felt things were running smoothly. Inside, a member of Ghanaâs
delegation blamed the queues on strict security due to Covid, while a delegate
from Tanzania said she was more concerned over restrictions that limit the
number of people from each country attending meetings. Others are less
sympathetic. Dr Kat Kramer, Christian Aidâs climate lead, with 10 COPs under
her belt, calls this the âleast inclusiveâ COP ever. She says restrictions on
civil society observers following the negotiations needs to be fixed âto
ensure vulnerable communities on the frontline of this crisis are fully
representedâ. And thereâs not enough seating or power points, she says,
and much longer queues than previous summits. âBasic logistics have been a
shambles,â she adds.  This video can not be played Climate change: 'We're seeing less snow on our Scottish mountains' On Wednesday, we reported that the UK's longest lasting patch of snow in the Highlands of Scotlandhas just disappeared for ""only the eighth time in 300 years"". BBC Young reporter Sofia, who knows that area well, has been looking into the impact of less frequent snowfalls on the hills. She's been talking to people around Aviemore in the Cairngorms to find out their concerns about having less snow and fewer snow days - and what that means for the planet. Matt McGrathEnvironment correspondent The joint statement on ending public financing for fossil fuel overseas,externalmay only have the support of
around 20 countries, but the fact that the US, the UK and Canada are among them
gives it weight. Funding will be removed from
all âunabatedâ oil and gas developments from the end of next year. This means
that there will be no cash for oil, gas and coal projects unless they capture
and bury the CO2 emissions that result from the burning of the fuel. Right now the countries
involved are spending around $18bn (Â£13bn) a year supporting fossil fuels abroad. There are some notable
absentees, though. China, Japan and South Korea are the worldâs biggest
financiers of overseas oil and gas and are not among the signatories. As well as the financing of
fossil fuels, thereâs also been a flurry of announcements here today on coal. While a lot of the talk at COP can feel abstract, the matter of coal is hitting home for one part of the UK. A new coal mine in Cumbria, in north-west England, could bring hundreds of well-paid jobs to the area - if it goes ahead. Right now the decision lies with planning inspectors but could fall into the hands of ministers. Boris Johnson, the UK prime minister, has said he doesn't want it to go ahead, telling COP26 he was""not in favour of more coal"". But Labour, the opposition party, has said the unresolved matter of a new UK coal mine is hampering the government's case at COP. Sir Keir Starmer, Labour party leader, said: ""Our ability to argue on the world stage that we should stop using coal is undermined by the government not, or at least flirting with the idea of opening a coal mine in Cumbria which would be a completely wrong step."" The UK should be moving ahead quickly towards safe, secure forms of energy, like hydrogen and wind, he said in an interview with BBC Radio Two's Jeremy Vine show. Read more on the controversy around the Cumbria coal minehere. Air pollution kills more than seven million people a year, Dr Jeni Miller of the Global Climate and Health Alliance tells the BBC, so phasing out fossil fuels and moving away from coal is a ""fantastic first step"". Climate change is taking its toll on so many of us, physically and mentally, she says, pointing to heatwaves in Canada, wildfires in Australia and flooding in Mexico. She adds that young people's mental health is being affected by the worries around climate change and those caught up in extreme weather were often left with PTSD. If the issue is not tackled, it's a fairly dire scenario, she warns, but if they can be addressed, there are benefits for us all. We've already heard from COP26 president Alok Sharma today and now he is giving a press conference. He says that ""coal is no longer king"" following the pledge by more than 40 countries to phase it out as a fuel. Sharma says that coal financing has ""been well and truly choked off"". But he says that despite the progress ""challenges are emerging"" as negotiators seek to formalise pledges - but he adds ""this is par for the course"". Sharma tells the press conference the transition from coal to clean energy ""must be just"" and says that so far through COP26 around $18bn have been pledged to help deliver this transition.

Climate denial flows unchecked on Facebook - study,"Climate change denial is spreading unchecked on Facebook, two studies by disinformation researchers have found. The Center for Countering Digital Hate and the Institute for Strategic Dialogue said less than 10% of misleading posts were marked as misinformation. And the CCDH researchers linked the majority of these to just 10 publishers. Facebook said this represented a small proportion of climate change content. The CCDH is a non-profit organisation which monitors and lobbies against online hate and misinformation. It found that of 7,000 misleading posts describing climate change as ""hysteria"", ""alarmism"", a ""scam"", or other related terms, only 8% were marked as misinformation. Facebook pledged to flag climate denial content early this year. The CCDH looked at a sample of posts from the past year which attracted roughly 700,000 likes and shares. Researchers used social media analytics tool Newswhip to search for strings of key words including ""climate change"", global warming"" and, ""fraud"", ""hoax"", ""cult"", ""scam"", ""lie"" and so on. The researchers manually reviewed every post to make sure it met their definition of climate denial and was not a post condemning such beliefs. Highly shared articles made false assertions that climate change was not confirmed by science or claimed to debunk it with data. Of these, 69% could be traced back to just 10 ""super-polluter"" publishers - dubbed the ""toxic ten"" - the campaign group found. In fact, our understanding of climate change comes from analyses of millions of measurements gathered in different parts of the world. And multiple independent teams of scientists have reached the same result - a spike in temperatures coinciding with the onset of the industrial era. Flooding in Indonesia has been linked to climate change- yet some online still deny its effects Many of the shared articles also pushed the unsubstantiated belief that ""climate lockdowns"" will be enforced on populations. Yet scientists point out this is highly unlikely given there is no evidence the Covid lockdowns led to a significant improvement for the climate. These posts represent the most extreme types of outright climate denial, according to the CCDH. They can't tell us the true scale of climate misinformation on the site but they do indicate climate conspiracy content is spreading without being labelled or removed by Facebook. Campaign group Stop Funding Heat, working together with think tank the Institute for Strategic Dialogue (ISD), said it had found far more misinformation which more generally ""undermines the existence or impacts of climate change, the human influence on climate change, and the need for urgent action"". Research published on Thursday analysed 48,700 posts between January and August 2021 and found just 3.6% posts containing climate misinformation included a fact-checking label. The group also identified 113 ads on Facebook with messages like ""climate change is a hoax"" between January and October 2021 with an estimated spend of between $58,000-$75,000 (about Â£42,000- 55,000). This appears to be a particular issue on Facebook. Counter-extremism think tank the ISD discovered during the 2021 German election that most of the top shared posts relating to renewable energy on the site (18 out of 25) either doubted climate change or criticised climate action. They found a similar trend on conversations around fossil fuels, with most of the top shared posts on Facebook (19 out of 25) arguing against climate action. On Twitter, on the other hand, the trend was reversed with most posts on the subjects promoting the scientific evidence or in support of climate action. Although the majority of the publishers of climate denial identified by CCDH were in the US, people from Brazil, India, Poland, Haiti, Mexico, Thailand, Russia, France and Germany were among their top viewers. And there were climate denial posts analysed by ISD from the UK, Australia, Russia, India, Poland, South Africa and Japan. A spokesperson, speaking on behalf of the Facebook platform, said the 700,000 interactions with the posts analysed by the CCDH made up a small fraction of the total 200 million interactions with climate change content on the site. ""We continue to combat climate misinformation by reducing the distribution of anything rated false or misleading by one of our fact-checking partners,"" the spokesperson said.

Helen BriggsBBC environment correspondent in Glasgow Suggestions that warming could be limited to slightly under
2C if countries were to fully deliver on their commitments to reduce emissions should be treated with caution, according to two leading climate
experts. Number-crunching of revised pledges made in the run-up to
Glasgow suggest these could put the world on track to limit global warming to
1.8 or 1.9C. But Dr Carl Schleussner, of Climate Analytics, says even
under the most âoptimisticâ scenarios, governments are not yet delivering in
terms of âclosing the gap in the near termâ. And Prof Simon Lewis, of UCL, says with some targets for
peaking emissions set so far into the future, governments' commitments âneed to
be taken with a pinch of saltâ. The UN recently predicted that the world was heading for a
temperature rise of 2.7C, based on an analysis of pledges made for 2030,
excluding those in recent days. If you include net zero commitments made by
some countries from 2050 onwards, this falls to 2.2C. The predictions by the IEA and by a group of scientists in
Australia are based on revised emission plans that have come in recently from a
number of countries, including India, which aims to peak emissions in 2070. Thursday marks day five of the UN climate conference in Glasgow. Here are some images of the week so far: The climate conference got under way on Sunday, with world leaders among thousands travelling to Glasgow British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he remains ""cautiously optimistic"" about a deal to keep global temperature rise below 1.5C Prince Charles is among the attendees, seen here at an event with fashion designer and sustainability advocate Stella McCartney Climate activists - including Extinction Rebellion - have been protesting on the side of the summit There have also been less traditional demonstrations spotted on the sidelines too - including a group dressed up as Pokemon character Pikachu trying to encourage Japan to move away from coal Rebecca HenschkeAsia editor, BBC World Service When Indonesia, home to some of the worldâs most carbon-rich
forests and peatlands, signed up to a deal to halt and reverse deforestation, it
was seen as a significant step forward. But now the country's environment and forestry minister Siti
Nurbaya Bakar has released a statement onsocial
media,externalsaying that Indonesia ""canât promise what we canât do"". She said forcing Indonesia to commit to ""zero deforestation
in 2030 is clearly inappropriate and unfair"".  Despite President Joko
Widodo signing the forest deal, she said that development remained the
countryâs top priority. Minister Nurbaya argued that the countryâs vast natural
resources must be used for the benefit of its people and cited the need to cut
down forests to make way for roads.  Deforestation of Indonesia's peatland forests also threaten populations like orangutans Controversial road projects in remote areas of Borneo and Papua have opened up previously untouched rainforest and lead to a spike in illegal logging. Indonesians have responded negatively to the minister's social posts commenting that itâs often big businesses that profit off deforestation while local people are left to deal with floods and landslides. One user wrote: ""Letâs destroy all the forests, to get money minister. Then we might have money to pay for oxygen.â Ashitha NageshBBC News, London You might not think of climate protests as all-singing all-dancing - but for one activist group, thatâs exactly what they are. The group, BP or Not BP, specifically protest against oil companies giving large donations and sponsorships to cultural institutions like galleries, museums and theatres - something they say is a way for oil companies to enhance their reputations. Their first protest almost 10 years ago, in April 2012, was at the Royal Shakespeare Company. Since then theyâve done 62 ""protest-performances"" - including wheeling a large Trojan horse into the lobby of the British Museum for the museumâs Troy exhibition in February 2020. And in that time, several institutions have ended their relationships with oil companies - including Tate, the British Film Institute and the Royal Shakespeare Company. BP boss Bernard Looney responded to the protests last year when he set out an ambition for the oil company to ""reimagine energy"". âMany
question our motives in supporting the arts,"" he said. ""I get that. ""We are taking steps
to more firmly and visibly align our intentions with our actions and become
much more transparent.â Adam EastonWarsaw Correspondent A number of solar panels attached to the wall of an old house in the centre of Krakow As we reported earlier, Poland has pledged to phase out coal by the end of the 2040s,
reaffirming last yearâs agreement with trade unions to close down the last pit
by 2049. The countryâs abundant Silesian coal reserves have long fuelled the
economy and generate around 80 per cent of its electricity. But Polish power
generators must now pay for their CO2 emissions, and rising carbon costs have
rendered many plants unprofitable. After years of defiantly championing
its black treasure, Poland is now investing in renewable energy, particularly
offshore wind, and seeking EU funds to gradually close down its mines and
retrain its workers. The country now has
one of the fastest growing solar energy markets in the EU, largely due to
homeowners like Michal Dera. He replaced his
electric heating system at his home in Bedzin near one of Silesiaâs coal-fired
power plants with a heat pump and installed solar panels to generate
electricity. I made the change to have a heating system that produced fewer emissions as well as save money. We use electricity for heating the house, charging cars, cooking, lighting and other household needs. At current electricity prices the investment should pay off in 8-10 years.â Michal Dera Helen BriggsBBC environment correspondent in Glasgow Organisation of the Glasgow summit has drawn complaints,
with grumbling over the long queues to get in and restrictions for observers
following the negotiations. âThe worst COP ever,â said one COP veteran, Kenyan
policy expert Mohamed Adow. Some even went as far as to invoke the spectre of
Copenhagen, the climate talks that ended in disaster in 2009, haunted by images
of delegates queuing outside in the snow. On my journey through the Blue Zone,
my fellow queuers were fairly sanguine. Austin, from Edinburgh, had anticipated queues and felt things were running smoothly. Inside, a member of Ghanaâs
delegation blamed the queues on strict security due to Covid, while a delegate
from Tanzania said she was more concerned over restrictions that limit the
number of people from each country attending meetings. Others are less
sympathetic. Dr Kat Kramer, Christian Aidâs climate lead, with 10 COPs under
her belt, calls this the âleast inclusiveâ COP ever. She says restrictions on
civil society observers following the negotiations needs to be fixed âto
ensure vulnerable communities on the frontline of this crisis are fully
representedâ. And thereâs not enough seating or power points, she says,
and much longer queues than previous summits. âBasic logistics have been a
shambles,â she adds.  This video can not be played Climate change: 'We're seeing less snow on our Scottish mountains' On Wednesday, we reported that the UK's longest lasting patch of snow in the Highlands of Scotlandhas just disappeared for ""only the eighth time in 300 years"". BBC Young reporter Sofia, who knows that area well, has been looking into the impact of less frequent snowfalls on the hills. She's been talking to people around Aviemore in the Cairngorms to find out their concerns about having less snow and fewer snow days - and what that means for the planet. Matt McGrathEnvironment correspondent The joint statement on ending public financing for fossil fuel overseas,externalmay only have the support of
around 20 countries, but the fact that the US, the UK and Canada are among them
gives it weight. Funding will be removed from
all âunabatedâ oil and gas developments from the end of next year. This means
that there will be no cash for oil, gas and coal projects unless they capture
and bury the CO2 emissions that result from the burning of the fuel. Right now the countries
involved are spending around $18bn (Â£13bn) a year supporting fossil fuels abroad. There are some notable
absentees, though. China, Japan and South Korea are the worldâs biggest
financiers of overseas oil and gas and are not among the signatories. As well as the financing of
fossil fuels, thereâs also been a flurry of announcements here today on coal. While a lot of the talk at COP can feel abstract, the matter of coal is hitting home for one part of the UK. A new coal mine in Cumbria, in north-west England, could bring hundreds of well-paid jobs to the area - if it goes ahead. Right now the decision lies with planning inspectors but could fall into the hands of ministers. Boris Johnson, the UK prime minister, has said he doesn't want it to go ahead, telling COP26 he was""not in favour of more coal"". But Labour, the opposition party, has said the unresolved matter of a new UK coal mine is hampering the government's case at COP. Sir Keir Starmer, Labour party leader, said: ""Our ability to argue on the world stage that we should stop using coal is undermined by the government not, or at least flirting with the idea of opening a coal mine in Cumbria which would be a completely wrong step."" The UK should be moving ahead quickly towards safe, secure forms of energy, like hydrogen and wind, he said in an interview with BBC Radio Two's Jeremy Vine show. Read more on the controversy around the Cumbria coal minehere. Air pollution kills more than seven million people a year, Dr Jeni Miller of the Global Climate and Health Alliance tells the BBC, so phasing out fossil fuels and moving away from coal is a ""fantastic first step"". Climate change is taking its toll on so many of us, physically and mentally, she says, pointing to heatwaves in Canada, wildfires in Australia and flooding in Mexico. She adds that young people's mental health is being affected by the worries around climate change and those caught up in extreme weather were often left with PTSD. If the issue is not tackled, it's a fairly dire scenario, she warns, but if they can be addressed, there are benefits for us all. We've already heard from COP26 president Alok Sharma today and now he is giving a press conference. He says that ""coal is no longer king"" following the pledge by more than 40 countries to phase it out as a fuel. Sharma says that coal financing has ""been well and truly choked off"". But he says that despite the progress ""challenges are emerging"" as negotiators seek to formalise pledges - but he adds ""this is par for the course"". Sharma tells the press conference the transition from coal to clean energy ""must be just"" and says that so far through COP26 around $18bn have been pledged to help deliver this transition.

PM given free holiday by minister GoldsmithBoris Johnson has confirmed he stayed at the Spanish home of Zac Goldsmith's family in October.UK Politics,"Boris Johnson has confirmed he stayed for free at a holiday home owned by the family of Lord Zac Goldsmith - who received a peerage from the PM in 2019. The list of ministers' interests says the PM has ""a longstanding personal friendship"" with the family and ""in that capacity"" stayed at their place in southern Spain last month. Downing Street had previously refused to confirm if the trip had happened. Labour said it was ""more evidence of the sleaze engulfing this government"". ""It's obvious to everyone that the prime minister is dishing out cushy jobs to his mate who pays for his luxury holidays,"" said the party's deputy leader Angela Rayner. ""Yet again Boris Johnson behaves like it's one rule for him and another for everyone else."" The party is also calling for an inquiry into why the holiday has not been declared on the Register of Members' Interests - a separate declaration made by all MPs, not just ministers. PM's explanation for Mustique trip criticised What are the rules governing political donations? Lord Goldsmith is close friend of the prime minister's wife and gave her her first job in politics. He lost his seat as an MP for Richmond Park in 2019, but retained his job as an environment minister after Mr Johnson appointed him to the House of Lords. At the time, Labour condemned the appointment as ""jobs for mates"". Boris Johnson stayed on the island of Mustique, shortly after winning the 2019 general election Mr Johnson has previously been criticised over being slow to explain how his holiday to the Caribbean island of Mustique was funded. An investigation by the Committee on Standards found he had not broken the rules but criticised the arrangements as ""ad hoc and informal"". The government is supposed to publish a list of any financial benefits received by ministers twice a year. Themost recent list includes,externalthe declaration that: ""The prime minister has a longstanding personal friendship with the Goldsmith family and, in that capacity, in October 2021, stayed in a holiday home in southern Spain which was provided free of charge by the Goldsmiths. ""Given Lord Goldsmith is a minister of the crown, the arrangement has accordingly been declared."" Mr Johnson may also declare the holiday gift in the register of MPs' interests, which is likely to include details about the cost of the donation.

"Farmer's fury over Â£15k tree planting scheme fineDavid Mills planted 13,000 trees in a government scheme, but is fined as some are in the wrong spot.Wales","David Mills planted trees as part of a government scheme, but was fined after being told some were in the wrong place A farmer said he was given a Â£15,000 fine after some of the trees he planted in a Welsh government scheme were in the wrong place - some by a few inches. David Mills, from Lower Chapel, Powys, decided to plant 13,000 trees on 20 acres of his land as part of the Glastir Woodland Creation scheme. Earlier this year, Mr Mills was told he had contravened the original plans. The Welsh government said it could not comment on a case which was subject to an appeal. It added it had a ""statutory obligation"" to enforce the rules, but it was reviewing the current rules of the scheme. Mr Mills's farm is in the heart of the Brecon Beacons Mr Mills said he felt like he had ""done his bit"" to encourage biodiversity on his farm and tackle climate change when he planted the trees. But he received a letter from Rural Payments Wales telling him he had contravened original plans - using satellite images as evidence - and that he faced a Â£15,000 fine. Climate change in Wales in charts Tiny forest of 600 trees to tackle climate change He said: ""We'd planted the right number of trees, I'd got someone from Welsh government to plan and draw up all the diagrams.

He said he had to borrow money from his son to pay the fine straight away, as it was accruing heavy interest, and that he had been unsuccessful in an appeal. He said Rural Payments Wales told him the tree planting differed from the original plan, in some cases by as little as 10cm (4in). Mr Mills has planted 13,000 trees on his 156-acre farm ""It's been horrific,"" Mr Mills added. ""I feel like I've been tricked and cheated, and the hypocrisy when you see someone [from Welsh government] saying 'we want to plant more trees' and this is the way I'm treated for doing what I thought was environmentally friendly. ""I want to increase biodiversity - I'm not doing it for any other reason other than I care."" Mr Mills said farmers should be supported, rather than penalised, for planting trees and maintaining them. He said: ""I would have expected a pat on the back, but instead of that I get a Â£15,000 fine."" His appeal has been supported by National Farmers' Union (NFU) Cymru, which said it is representing two other farms in similar situations but facing even higher fines. Stella Owen, from NFU Cymru, said fines for farmers trying to do the right thing would put people off tree planting Stella Owen, a county adviser, said she was concerned about the reputational damage to the tree planting scheme. She said it was not just about the financial penalty as farmers found it ""scarring"" to have committed to the scheme and then feel like they have failed. ""That's no help to anybody, that doesn't deliver the aspirations of what Welsh government want,"" she added. ""That doesn't do anything for the mental health of the farmer and to all intents and purposes, it will just put people off. ""If they want that uptake, then there has to be more leniency in terms of a simple, robust scheme which can allow changes. ""There is absolutely no need for this level of financial penalty to be imposed five years down the line."" The scheme was launched in 2015 with the aim of combating climate change, increasing biodiversity and establishing habitats for wildlife. Farmers were offered grants to plant trees and payments to maintain them over 12 years, which feed into plans for aNational Forest for Wales. The Welsh government said: ""Contracts can be verified by on-farm visits or the use of latest available aerial imagery. ""When the scheme verification shows the conditions of the contract have not been met, the Welsh government has a statutory obligation to apply European Commission rules concerning the recovery of payments and application of over-declaration penalties.

European manhunt for Â£26m celebrity burglaries suspectAlfredo Lindley is accused of involvement in burglaries that targeted stars including Frank Lampard.London,"Police in Milan have linked Alfredo Lindley to other alleged burglaries in Italy A European manhunt is under way for a man accused of one of the biggest burglaries in English legal history, a BBC investigation has found. Alfredo Lindley is said to have led a series of burglaries on the luxury homes of three celebrities in December 2019 - including a Â£25m raid on the home of F1 heiress Tamara Ecclestone. Italian authorities also accuse Lindley of raiding the home of Patrick Vieira, now Crystal Palace manager, in 2009. Lindley is believed to be in Belgrade. The 40-year-old Peruvian national has a criminal record in Italy for scams and burglaries under multiple identities dating back to 1995, according to court documents obtained by the BBC. Information shows in the past decade Lindley has used at least 19 aliases - including Daniel Vukovic, Ljubomir Romanov and Ljubomir Radosavlejic. Documents reveal these identities have links to various European cities including Belgrade, Sarajevo, Milan and Zagreb. The BBC has traced Lindley's last-known movements to the Serbian capital Belgrade Under the name Ljubomir Romanov, Lindley appeared before a court in Belgrade on 27 August faced with extradition to the UK. The case was brought by the Republic of Serbia's specialised department for organised crime.

European manhunt for Â£26m celebrity burglaries suspectAlfredo Lindley is accused of involvement in burglaries that targeted stars including Frank Lampard.,"Police in Milan have linked Alfredo Lindley to other alleged burglaries in Italy A European manhunt is under way for a man accused of one of the biggest burglaries in English legal history, a BBC investigation has found. Alfredo Lindley is said to have led a series of burglaries on the luxury homes of three celebrities in December 2019 - including a Â£25m raid on the home of F1 heiress Tamara Ecclestone. Italian authorities also accuse Lindley of raiding the home of Patrick Vieira, now Crystal Palace manager, in 2009. Lindley is believed to be in Belgrade. The 40-year-old Peruvian national has a criminal record in Italy for scams and burglaries under multiple identities dating back to 1995, according to court documents obtained by the BBC. Information shows in the past decade Lindley has used at least 19 aliases - including Daniel Vukovic, Ljubomir Romanov and Ljubomir Radosavlejic. Documents reveal these identities have links to various European cities including Belgrade, Sarajevo, Milan and Zagreb. The BBC has traced Lindley's last-known movements to the Serbian capital Belgrade Under the name Ljubomir Romanov, Lindley appeared before a court in Belgrade on 27 August faced with extradition to the UK.

"JD Sports angry over forced sale of FootasylumThe sportswear retailer's chairman said the UK competition watchdog's ruling was ""beyond logic"".","JD Sports has hit out at the UK's competition watchdog after being forced to sell rival chain Footasylum. After an investigation, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) ruled that the takeover could lead to a ""worse deal"" for customers. But JD Sports criticised the move, calling the decision ""inexplicable"" and ""beyond logic"". Its chairman Peter Cowgill suggested that the CMA is in ""a minority of one in reaching this conclusion"". The CMA found that JD Sports was the closest alternative for Footasylum shoppers. However, the retailer has argued that one of the key areas of competition it faces is from brands such as Nike and Adidas selling their goods direct to consumers online. JD Sports' chairman Peter Cowgill noted that the CMA had acknowledged that these direct sales were a threat to the retailer, which, he said, made the competition body's decision puzzling. JD Sports boss rejects criticism of Â£4.3m bonus Brexit worse than feared, says JD Sports boss The deal to buy Footasylum was first announced in April 2019. The latest ruling by the CMA follows an in-depth investigation after the competition watchdog first blocked the Â£90m takeover last year. JD Sports appealed against a ruling by the CMA in September, saying it was ""perplexed"" by its decision not to include online sales to consumers by major brands. In an update on Thursday, the CMA found that the takeover of Footasylum would reduce competition even after taking into account the growth in online shopping. Half of 1,300 online shoppers surveyed by the competition watchdog said that they would go to JD Sports if they were unable to purchase their usual trainers or joggers at Footasylum. It suggested that customers would have fewer options and could face higher prices, fewer discounts, and less choice of products in-store as a result. Kip Meek, chair of the CMA inquiry group, said: ""The UK boasts a thriving sports fashion market and today's decision reflects our commitment to keeping it that way. ""We strongly believe shoppers could suffer if Footasylum stopped having to compete with JD Sports. It is likely they would pay more for less choice, worse service and lower quality."" It added that the rivals can continue to compete for shoppers online and as they return to the High Street. JD Sports argued on Thursday that the CMA in fact agreed with it on several fronts. It said, for example, that the CMA had found JD Sports' biggest competition came from international brands selling to consumers from their own websites or apps. JD Sports also said that it would have no incentive to raise prices or reduce deals for shoppers. JD Sports boss Peter Cowgill said the CMA's decision was ""inexplicable"" In a statement to investors, JD Sports said that ""the decision to prohibit the acquisition defies logic"", given that Footasylum has a market share of less than 5%. ""The CMA rightly concludes that, following the acquisition of Footasylum, JD would have no incentive to raise prices or worsen its offer as its most important competitors are the [Direct to Consumer] DTC operations of the international brands themselves,"" said Mr Cowgill. ""However, the CMA has then somehow concluded that the competitive threat from DTC does not extend to Footasylum and that JD would have an incentive to worsen the offer in Footasylum to the detriment of both consumers and suppliers. We would suggest that the CMA is in a minority of one in reaching this conclusion. ""Overall, the CMA's decision today continues to be inexplicable to anyone who understands what difference the pandemic has made to UK retail and how competition and the supply chain in our markets actually work."" Mr Cowgill added that the decision comes after the UK High Street has been seriously damaged by coronavirus-related lockdowns and could see further closures. The sportswear retailer has four weeks to lodge an appeal with the Competition Appeal Tribunal following the decision. JD said that it is studying the CMA's new report in detail and will consider its options ""carefully"". Despite the watchdog's decision, JD's share price rose by more than 3% on Thursday to Â£11.17. Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said that investors appeared to have ""shrugged off"" the news. ""The acquisition was part of the company's quest for dominance in the sportswear market,"" she said. ""But the decision by the CMA on the grounds that keeping Footasylum within the group would lead to a lack of choice for customers, indicates just how formidable JD Sports now is as an online powerhouse.""

"More than 40 countries pledge to quit coalBig coal users like Poland and Vietnam vow to phase it out, but China, India and the US have not.","Coal produced around 37% of the world's electricity in 2019 More than 40 countries have committed to shift away from coal, in pledges made at the COP26 climate summit. Major coal-using countries including Poland, Vietnam and Chile are among those to make the commitment. But some of the world's biggest coal-dependent countries, including China and the US, did not sign up. In a separate commitment, 20 countries, including the US, pledged to end public financing for ""unabated"" fossil fuel projects abroad by the end of 2022. Such projects burn fossil fuels, like coal, oil and natural gas, without using technology to capture the CO2 emissions. Coal is the single biggest contributor to climate change. Signatories to the agreement have committed to ending all investment in new coal power generation domestically and internationally. They have also agreed to phase out coal power in the 2030s for major economies, and the 2040s for poorer nations, the UK said. Dozens of organisations also signed up to the pledge, with several major banks agreeing to stop financing the coal industry. ""The end of coal is in sight,"" UK business and energy secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said. ""The world is moving in the right direction, standing ready to seal coal's fate and embrace the environmental and economic benefits of building a future that is powered by clean energy."" But UK shadow business secretary Ed Miliband said there were ""glaring gaps"" from China and other large emitters, who have not committed to stop increasing coal use domestically. He also noted that there was nothing on the phasing out of oil and gas. Mr Miliband said the UK government ""has let others off the hook"". Tap or click to go through the gallery  Although progress has been made in reducing coal use globally, it still produced around 37% of the world's electricity in 2019. Countries like South Africa, Poland and India will need major investments to make their energy sectors cleaner. Juan Pablo Osornio, head of Greenpeace's delegation at COP26, said: ""Overall this statement still falls well short of the ambition needed on fossil fuels in this critical decade."" ""The small print seemingly gives countries enormous leeway to pick their own phase-out date, despite the shiny headline,"" he added. There's been such a flurry of announcements on the world's most polluting fossil fuel, that it's hard to see the light for all the (coal) dust. There are many questions outstanding. One of the biggest is the list of countries missing from this bonfire of coal commitments - including the US, China and India. The time scales for phase-out are also a bit woolly - with richer countries promising to end coal by the 2030s, with developing nations in the 2040s. None of these commitments are binding - again there is no big stick to force countries to do this. And how many of the plans to stop using coal in developing countries will need financial support from the developed world? We've already seen the UK, Germany and the US step up to pay South Africa's $8.5bn (Â£6.2bn) to move away from coal. Other countries are said to be interested in following in South Africa's footsteps. So is there also a question of the rich countries paying others to do what they struggle to do at home? While the US was notably absent from the coal commitments, it joined 19 other countries - including the UK, Canada and New Zealand - in pledging to stop financing unabated overseas fossil fuel projects. ""Investing in unabated fossil-related energy projects increasingly entails both social and economic risksâ¦ and has ensuing negative impacts on government revenue, local employment, taxpayers, utility ratepayers and public health,"" the signatories of the UK-led initiative said in a joint statement. The deal saw countries and financial institutions vow to steer their spending into clean energy instead. It allowed for exemptions in unspecified ""limited"" circumstances, but said these must be consistent with efforts to limit global temperature rises to 1.5C. ""Ending international finance for all unabated fossil fuels is the next critical frontier we must deliver on,"" UK energy minister Greg Hands said. ""We must put public finance on the right side of history."" However, major financers of such projects, such as China, Japan and South Korea, did not sign up. The countries did join G20 nations last month in agreeing to end financial support for new unabated coal plants overseas.

"Bank of England hints at future interest rate riseThe Bank signals it will raise interest rates in ""coming months"", but holds off on an immediate increase.Business","The Bank of England has signalled it will raise interest rates in ""coming months"" in response to high inflation, but held off on an immediate increase. On Thursday, Bank policymakers voted 7-2 in favour of no change from the current record low rate of 0.1%. Bank governor Andrew Bailey said the decision had been a ""close call"". The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) said there was ""value"" in waiting to see how the jobs market coped with the end of the furlough scheme. However, it did not rule out a rate rise at its next meeting in December. The MPC meets every six weeks. When pressed on when a rate rise might come, Mr Bailey said: ""From now onwards."" He said the MPC had ""spent many hours"" pondering its decision, adding: ""The calls are close, they are quite hard. It's a reflection of the position we're in."" In a BBC interview, Mr Bailey said current conditions were different because inflation was being caused by global ""supply shocks"" rather than demand pressure in the UK economy. ""Putting interest rates up, I'm afraid, isn't going to get us more gas,"" he added. But he said that interest rates were not going to return to levels seen before the 2008 financial crisis. ""For the foreseeable future, we're in a world of low interest rates,"" he said. ""That doesn't mean that they don't rise and fall within that sort of bound. But I want to be quite clear, we're not signalling that there's going to be some very sharp return to the world that we can just about remember before the financial crisis."" Mr Bailey said the MPC wanted to see ""more evidence"" of how the labour market was evolving before raising interest rates. However, he stressed: ""We think there will be some need to increase interest rates to bring inflation sustainably back to target. And we will be ready to do that."" How do interest rates affect your money? Why is the cost of living going up? While the MPC voted to keep interest rates on hold, policymakers were split on the decision. Two of the nine members, Dave Ramsden and Michael Saunders, voted to raise rates immediately to 0.25%. Rates were cut to their current level in March last year in response to the effects of the coronavirus pandemic. But the reopening of the economy has fuelled price rises, prompting expectations that the Bank would increase borrowing costs. Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said the decision to hold the interest rate at 0.1% was a ""close call"" The pound fell by nearly 1% against the dollar to $1.3556 following the Bank's decision, reflecting the fact that investors had bet on a rate rise. Financial markets expect the interest rate to hit 1% by the end of next year. Electricity and gas prices have surged as the global economy reopens. Factories and businesses are also struggling with staff shortages and a backlog of orders, which has also pushed up prices. The Bank expects inflation to peak at 5% next April, up from 3.1% in September. This would be the highest rate in more than a decade and far higher than the Bank's target of 2%. The Bank said households faced ""substantially"" higher energy bills next year. Policymakers also said food prices were likely to rise in the run-up to Christmas. However, they added that the sharp increase in inflation was expected to be ""temporary"", with price rises expected to ease back towards 2% in the second half of next year. Higher inflation is expected to put pressure on household finances for the next two years. The Bank's latest Monetary Policy Report expects price rises to outpace pay increases in 2022 and 2023. So-called real incomes are expected to barely grow in 2024. High Street banks use the interest rate set by the Bank's MPC to set their own mortgages and savings rates. While an increase in interest rates would have been bad news for borrowers, many mortgage holders would not have faced an immediate increase in payments. Three quarters of mortgage holders are currently on fixed-rate deals. Higher prices are expected to weigh on growth in the near term. The Bank now expects the economy to grow by 1.5% in the three months to September. This is almost half the rate expected at its previous forecast in August. As a result, the economy is not expected to get back to its pre-pandemic size until the start of next year. It had previously expected the economy to recover by the end of 2021. The Bank also cut its forecast for annual growth in 2021 and 2022 to 7% and 5% respectively, down from 7.25% and 6% previously. In September, around a million workers were still on the government's furlough scheme that subsidised wages. The scheme ended in October and the Bank expects most of those who were on furlough to return to work. While the peak in inflation next April is expected at a time when around 40% of workers are negotiating pay deals, the Bank does not expect higher prices to lead to big demands for pay rises. It suggested that many workers were still scarred by the financial crisis, when many accepted slow pay growth or wage freezes even amid rising inflation. Be in no doubt, people and businesses should prepare for rates rising in the coming months, perhaps as high as 1% from their record lows of 0.1%, but not precisely this month. The message from the Bank of England is that the economy has been hit by supply chain bottlenecks, both for goods and workers, pushing back the time when the economy regains all the lost pandemic growth into early next year. And while the inflation picture is now worse, with a forecast peak of 5% when the energy price cap is due to be further increased in April 2022, there is not much the Bank thinks it can do about the global drivers of this. Where the Bank can act is around the persistence of this inflation into 2023 and 2024. They do now feel there is a risk that pressures from rising prices last. If interest rates were kept at these emergency lows, the Bank forecasts inflation would still be about 3% in late 2024. But acting now would have required immediate evidence of a spiral in wage rises across the economy. On balance, the members of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee want to see official data in a fortnight on the impact of the end of the furlough scheme on the jobs market.

European manhunt for Â£26m celebrity burglaries suspect,"Police in Milan have linked Alfredo Lindley to other alleged burglaries in Italy A European manhunt is under way for a man accused of one of the biggest burglaries in English legal history, a BBC investigation has found. Alfredo Lindley is said to have led a series of burglaries on the luxury homes of three celebrities in December 2019 - including a Â£25m raid on the home of F1 heiress Tamara Ecclestone. Italian authorities also accuse Lindley of raiding the home of Patrick Vieira, now Crystal Palace manager, in 2009. Lindley is believed to be in Belgrade. The 40-year-old Peruvian national has a criminal record in Italy for scams and burglaries under multiple identities dating back to 1995, according to court documents obtained by the BBC. Information shows in the past decade Lindley has used at least 19 aliases - including Daniel Vukovic, Ljubomir Romanov and Ljubomir Radosavlejic. Documents reveal these identities have links to various European cities including Belgrade, Sarajevo, Milan and Zagreb. The BBC has traced Lindley's last-known movements to the Serbian capital Belgrade Under the name Ljubomir Romanov, Lindley appeared before a court in Belgrade on 27 August faced with extradition to the UK. The case was brought by the Republic of Serbia's specialised department for organised crime. However, the extradition was refused by the Serbian authorities and Lindley is still believed to be in Belgrade. He is listed as the co-owner of a construction business in the centre of the city. According to his Serbian Government-issued ID, his home address is in the town of Obrenovac, a municipality of Belgrade. Met Police detectives say Lindley is ""wanted for questioning in respect of a series of high-value burglaries committed in December 2019 in the borough of Kensington and Chelsea"". The homes of Frank and Christine Lampard, Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha and Tamara Ecclestone and her husband were all broken into during December 2019 During the first 13 days of December 2019, an estimatedÂ£26m worth of items were takenfrom the west London homes of Ms Ecclestone, Frank Lampard and the deceased former owner of Leicester City Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha The raid on Ms Ecclestone's mansion alone - on one of the most expensive streets in the world - is believed to be the biggest domestic burglary in English legal history. Most of the stolen jewellery and watches have never been recovered. A Cartier bangle was among Ms Ecclestone's personal items stolen in the burglary Earlier this year, four Romanian nationals werecleared of conspiracy to commit burglaryfollowing a two-month trial. Italian nationals Jugoslav Jovanovic, 24, Alessandro Donati, 44, and Alessandro Maltese, 45, were each extradited from Italy to the UK andhave admitted their part in the raids. They will be sentenced at Isleworth Crown Court on 15 November. Alessandro Maltese, Jugoslav Jovanovic and Alessandro Donati were all arrested in Italy and extradited to the UK On 30 November 2019, under the name Daniel Vukovic, Lindley, along with Jovanovic, flew in to London Stansted from Stockholm, according to details read out in a related court case. The pair set up a base at a hotel in Orpington, south-east London. The next day Jovanovic burgled the west London home of ex-Chelsea and England footballer Lampard and his wife Christine while the couple were out. More than Â£50,000 worth of items were stolen, including white-gold Patek Philippe cufflinks, a Cartier pocket watch, two rose-gold ladies' watches and a Mia Lia gold necklace. Lindley is accused by police of being involved in the burglary. The west London home of Frank and Christine Lampard was burgled on 1 December 2019 Then on 10 December, a Knightsbridge property belonging to the family of billionaire Leicester City owner Mr Srivaddhanaprabha was burgled. Mr Srivaddhanaprabhadied in a helicopter crash outside the King Power Stadium in October 2018and his family said the home had been left untouched since his death. Lindley is accused of ransacking the house along with Jovanovic, Maltese and Donati. Jurors were told last November that among the items taken were seven Patek Philippe watches, a Tag Heuer smart watch and about â¬400,000 in cash. Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha bought Leicester City in 2010 The next day the group dined at a sushi restaurant near Harrods where they had a Â£760 champagne and sashimi lunch. Finally, on 13 December, Lindley is said to have carried out the Ecclestone raid, along with Maltese and Donati, while Jovanovic kept watch. Isleworth Crown Court heard that the men, equipped with screwdrivers, targeted the palatial home opposite Kensington Palace F1 heiress Ms Ecclestone shares with her husband Jay Rutland. The couple had left for a Christmas holiday in Lapland only hours earlier. Kensington Palace Gardens is the most expensive street in the world, has an armed-guard presence and is home to the Russian, French and Israeli embassies as well as Chelsea FC owner Roman Abramovic and the Sultan of Brunei. Jay Rutland, Tamara Ecclestone and their daughter had left for Lapland on the morning of the burglary Many of the rooms inside Ms Ecclestone's mansion were cleared of valuables. In just over an hour, the burglars made off with 400 items of jewellery and large sums of cash. After a brief stay at an AirBnB in Chelsea, Lindley left the country on 18 December on an AirSerbia flight from Heathrow to Belgrade. Detectives do not believe Lindley has been back to the UK since. Before leaving the UK, Lindley was caught on CCTV inside Harrods department store numerous times Authorities in Italy allege Lindley is linked to more high-end burglaries. They say that in September 2009 he and some accomplices raided the homes of international footballers Patrick Vieira and Sulley Muntari. The two midfielders had been playing in a Milan derby for Internazionale when their homes were burgled. Italian court documents allege the gang took possession of a safe containing about â¬15,000 in cash, jewellery and 28 ""fine watches"" worth about â¬200,000. Patrick Vieira (bottom right) enjoyed success with Arsenal before moving to Juventus and then Inter Milan The estimated value of the haul from both burglaries was over â¬1m. According to the documents, proceedings against him are yet to take place although they were due to commence in June 2017. The papers also state that on New Year's Eve 2010, Lindley was caught on camera entering the Milan apartment of Maria Luisa Gavazzeni, the widow of the designer Nicola Trussardi. Maria Luisa Gavazzeni was married to Nicola Trussardi After forcing open a window, Lindley and his accomplices removed a safe that contained â¬2m worth of jewels. He was jailed for two years and four months for his part in the burglary. Lindley and his legal representatives did not respond when approached by the BBC.

Bank of England holds interest rates at 0.1%Policymakers vote 7-2 to keep rates at their historic low despite rising inflation.Business,"The Bank of England has signalled it will raise interest rates in ""coming months"" in response to high inflation, but held off on an immediate increase. On Thursday, Bank policymakers voted 7-2 in favour of no change from the current record low rate of 0.1%. Bank governor Andrew Bailey said the decision had been a ""close call"". The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) said there was ""value"" in waiting to see how the jobs market coped with the end of the furlough scheme. However, it did not rule out a rate rise at its next meeting in December. The MPC meets every six weeks. When pressed on when a rate rise might come, Mr Bailey said: ""From now onwards."" He said the MPC had ""spent many hours"" pondering its decision, adding: ""The calls are close, they are quite hard. It's a reflection of the position we're in."" In a BBC interview, Mr Bailey said current conditions were different because inflation was being caused by global ""supply shocks"" rather than demand pressure in the UK economy. ""Putting interest rates up, I'm afraid, isn't going to get us more gas,"" he added. But he said that interest rates were not going to return to levels seen before the 2008 financial crisis. ""For the foreseeable future, we're in a world of low interest rates,"" he said. ""That doesn't mean that they don't rise and fall within that sort of bound. But I want to be quite clear, we're not signalling that there's going to be some very sharp return to the world that we can just about remember before the financial crisis."" Mr Bailey said the MPC wanted to see ""more evidence"" of how the labour market was evolving before raising interest rates. However, he stressed: ""We think there will be some need to increase interest rates to bring inflation sustainably back to target. And we will be ready to do that."" How do interest rates affect your money? Why is the cost of living going up? While the MPC voted to keep interest rates on hold, policymakers were split on the decision. Two of the nine members, Dave Ramsden and Michael Saunders, voted to raise rates immediately to 0.25%. Rates were cut to their current level in March last year in response to the effects of the coronavirus pandemic. But the reopening of the economy has fuelled price rises, prompting expectations that the Bank would increase borrowing costs. Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said the decision to hold the interest rate at 0.1% was a ""close call"" The pound fell by nearly 1% against the dollar to $1.3556 following the Bank's decision, reflecting the fact that investors had bet on a rate rise. Financial markets expect the interest rate to hit 1% by the end of next year. Electricity and gas prices have surged as the global economy reopens. Factories and businesses are also struggling with staff shortages and a backlog of orders, which has also pushed up prices. The Bank expects inflation to peak at 5% next April, up from 3.1% in September. This would be the highest rate in more than a decade and far higher than the Bank's target of 2%. The Bank said households faced ""substantially"" higher energy bills next year. Policymakers also said food prices were likely to rise in the run-up to Christmas. However, they added that the sharp increase in inflation was expected to be ""temporary"", with price rises expected to ease back towards 2% in the second half of next year. Higher inflation is expected to put pressure on household finances for the next two years. The Bank's latest Monetary Policy Report expects price rises to outpace pay increases in 2022 and 2023. So-called real incomes are expected to barely grow in 2024. High Street banks use the interest rate set by the Bank's MPC to set their own mortgages and savings rates. While an increase in interest rates would have been bad news for borrowers, many mortgage holders would not have faced an immediate increase in payments. Three quarters of mortgage holders are currently on fixed-rate deals. Higher prices are expected to weigh on growth in the near term. The Bank now expects the economy to grow by 1.5% in the three months to September. This is almost half the rate expected at its previous forecast in August. As a result, the economy is not expected to get back to its pre-pandemic size until the start of next year. It had previously expected the economy to recover by the end of 2021. The Bank also cut its forecast for annual growth in 2021 and 2022 to 7% and 5% respectively, down from 7.25% and 6% previously. In September, around a million workers were still on the government's furlough scheme that subsidised wages. The scheme ended in October and the Bank expects most of those who were on furlough to return to work. While the peak in inflation next April is expected at a time when around 40% of workers are negotiating pay deals, the Bank does not expect higher prices to lead to big demands for pay rises. It suggested that many workers were still scarred by the financial crisis, when many accepted slow pay growth or wage freezes even amid rising inflation. Be in no doubt, people and businesses should prepare for rates rising in the coming months, perhaps as high as 1% from their record lows of 0.1%, but not precisely this month. The message from the Bank of England is that the economy has been hit by supply chain bottlenecks, both for goods and workers, pushing back the time when the economy regains all the lost pandemic growth into early next year. And while the inflation picture is now worse, with a forecast peak of 5% when the energy price cap is due to be further increased in April 2022, there is not much the Bank thinks it can do about the global drivers of this. Where the Bank can act is around the persistence of this inflation into 2023 and 2024. They do now feel there is a risk that pressures from rising prices last. If interest rates were kept at these emergency lows, the Bank forecasts inflation would still be about 3% in late 2024. But acting now would have required immediate evidence of a spiral in wage rises across the economy.

JD Sports angry over forced sale of Footasylum,"JD Sports has hit out at the UK's competition watchdog after being forced to sell rival chain Footasylum. After an investigation, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) ruled that the takeover could lead to a ""worse deal"" for customers. But JD Sports criticised the move, calling the decision ""inexplicable"" and ""beyond logic"". Its chairman Peter Cowgill suggested that the CMA is in ""a minority of one in reaching this conclusion"". The CMA found that JD Sports was the closest alternative for Footasylum shoppers. However, the retailer has argued that one of the key areas of competition it faces is from brands such as Nike and Adidas selling their goods direct to consumers online. JD Sports' chairman Peter Cowgill noted that the CMA had acknowledged that these direct sales were a threat to the retailer, which, he said, made the competition body's decision puzzling. JD Sports boss rejects criticism of Â£4.3m bonus Brexit worse than feared, says JD Sports boss The deal to buy Footasylum was first announced in April 2019. The latest ruling by the CMA follows an in-depth investigation after the competition watchdog first blocked the Â£90m takeover last year. JD Sports appealed against a ruling by the CMA in September, saying it was ""perplexed"" by its decision not to include online sales to consumers by major brands. In an update on Thursday, the CMA found that the takeover of Footasylum would reduce competition even after taking into account the growth in online shopping. Half of 1,300 online shoppers surveyed by the competition watchdog said that they would go to JD Sports if they were unable to purchase their usual trainers or joggers at Footasylum. It suggested that customers would have fewer options and could face higher prices, fewer discounts, and less choice of products in-store as a result. Kip Meek, chair of the CMA inquiry group, said: ""The UK boasts a thriving sports fashion market and today's decision reflects our commitment to keeping it that way. ""We strongly believe shoppers could suffer if Footasylum stopped having to compete with JD Sports. It is likely they would pay more for less choice, worse service and lower quality."" It added that the rivals can continue to compete for shoppers online and as they return to the High Street. JD Sports argued on Thursday that the CMA in fact agreed with it on several fronts. It said, for example, that the CMA had found JD Sports' biggest competition came from international brands selling to consumers from their own websites or apps. JD Sports also said that it would have no incentive to raise prices or reduce deals for shoppers. JD Sports boss Peter Cowgill said the CMA's decision was ""inexplicable"" In a statement to investors, JD Sports said that ""the decision to prohibit the acquisition defies logic"", given that Footasylum has a market share of less than 5%. ""The CMA rightly concludes that, following the acquisition of Footasylum, JD would have no incentive to raise prices or worsen its offer as its most important competitors are the [Direct to Consumer] DTC operations of the international brands themselves,"" said Mr Cowgill. ""However, the CMA has then somehow concluded that the competitive threat from DTC does not extend to Footasylum and that JD would have an incentive to worsen the offer in Footasylum to the detriment of both consumers and suppliers. We would suggest that the CMA is in a minority of one in reaching this conclusion. ""Overall, the CMA's decision today continues to be inexplicable to anyone who understands what difference the pandemic has made to UK retail and how competition and the supply chain in our markets actually work."" Mr Cowgill added that the decision comes after the UK High Street has been seriously damaged by coronavirus-related lockdowns and could see further closures. The sportswear retailer has four weeks to lodge an appeal with the Competition Appeal Tribunal following the decision. JD said that it is studying the CMA's new report in detail and will consider its options ""carefully"". Despite the watchdog's decision, JD's share price rose by more than 3% on Thursday to Â£11.17. Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said that investors appeared to have ""shrugged off"" the news. ""The acquisition was part of the company's quest for dominance in the sportswear market,"" she said. ""But the decision by the CMA on the grounds that keeping Footasylum within the group would lead to a lack of choice for customers, indicates just how formidable JD Sports now is as an online powerhouse.""

More than 40 countries pledge to quit coal,"Coal produced around 37% of the world's electricity in 2019 More than 40 countries have committed to shift away from coal, in pledges made at the COP26 climate summit. Major coal-using countries including Poland, Vietnam and Chile are among those to make the commitment. But some of the world's biggest coal-dependent countries, including China and the US, did not sign up. In a separate commitment, 20 countries, including the US, pledged to end public financing for ""unabated"" fossil fuel projects abroad by the end of 2022. Such projects burn fossil fuels, like coal, oil and natural gas, without using technology to capture the CO2 emissions. Coal is the single biggest contributor to climate change. Signatories to the agreement have committed to ending all investment in new coal power generation domestically and internationally. They have also agreed to phase out coal power in the 2030s for major economies, and the 2040s for poorer nations, the UK said. Dozens of organisations also signed up to the pledge, with several major banks agreeing to stop financing the coal industry. ""The end of coal is in sight,"" UK business and energy secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said. ""The world is moving in the right direction, standing ready to seal coal's fate and embrace the environmental and economic benefits of building a future that is powered by clean energy."" But UK shadow business secretary Ed Miliband said there were ""glaring gaps"" from China and other large emitters, who have not committed to stop increasing coal use domestically. He also noted that there was nothing on the phasing out of oil and gas. Mr Miliband said the UK government ""has let others off the hook"". Tap or click to go through the gallery  Although progress has been made in reducing coal use globally, it still produced around 37% of the world's electricity in 2019. Countries like South Africa, Poland and India will need major investments to make their energy sectors cleaner. Juan Pablo Osornio, head of Greenpeace's delegation at COP26, said: ""Overall this statement still falls well short of the ambition needed on fossil fuels in this critical decade."" ""The small print seemingly gives countries enormous leeway to pick their own phase-out date, despite the shiny headline,"" he added. There's been such a flurry of announcements on the world's most polluting fossil fuel, that it's hard to see the light for all the (coal) dust. There are many questions outstanding. One of the biggest is the list of countries missing from this bonfire of coal commitments - including the US, China and India. The time scales for phase-out are also a bit woolly - with richer countries promising to end coal by the 2030s, with developing nations in the 2040s. None of these commitments are binding - again there is no big stick to force countries to do this. And how many of the plans to stop using coal in developing countries will need financial support from the developed world? We've already seen the UK, Germany and the US step up to pay South Africa's $8.5bn (Â£6.2bn) to move away from coal. Other countries are said to be interested in following in South Africa's footsteps. So is there also a question of the rich countries paying others to do what they struggle to do at home? While the US was notably absent from the coal commitments, it joined 19 other countries - including the UK, Canada and New Zealand - in pledging to stop financing unabated overseas fossil fuel projects. ""Investing in unabated fossil-related energy projects increasingly entails both social and economic risksâ¦ and has ensuing negative impacts on government revenue, local employment, taxpayers, utility ratepayers and public health,"" the signatories of the UK-led initiative said in a joint statement. The deal saw countries and financial institutions vow to steer their spending into clean energy instead. It allowed for exemptions in unspecified ""limited"" circumstances, but said these must be consistent with efforts to limit global temperature rises to 1.5C. ""Ending international finance for all unabated fossil fuels is the next critical frontier we must deliver on,"" UK energy minister Greg Hands said. ""We must put public finance on the right side of history."" However, major financers of such projects, such as China, Japan and South Korea, did not sign up. The countries did join G20 nations last month in agreeing to end financial support for new unabated coal plants overseas.

Thousands remain without state pension payments,"Thousands of newly-retired people are still yet to receive their first state pension payments after a deadline for backlogs in payments to be cleared. Most delayed pensions to people who have just turned 66 are now being paid following a catch-up exercise by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP). But applications have yet to be processed for 4,900 people from whom the DWP has asked for extra details. The pandemic and staffing issues were blamed for problems over the summer. Many thousands of people did not receive their state pension entitlement on time, owing to the administration issues at the DWP. Some told the BBC of theirdistress, financial strain, and frustrationat the problems. Unpaid state pension: 'We're below the breadline' Delays in state pension payments 'causing anxiety' Pensions minister Guy Opperman told MPs earlier this year that hundreds of department staff were being redeployed to deal with the backlog in state pension payments. He promised them that the system would be back to normal by the end of October. Now, the DWP has said that there were still 4,900 pension claims which had required officials to contact customers, and more information was required before processing would be completed. ""We are sorry that some new customers have faced delays receiving their state pension,"" said a DWP spokesman. ""We have now issued all outstanding payments and are in contact with those customers where more information is required in order to complete processing.""

"Biden rejects blame for shock Virginia vote lossThe president cites schools, jobs, petrol prices and ""Trump voters"" as reasons for the defeat.US & Canada","Joe Biden has rejected suggestions that his Democratic party's shock loss in the Virginia governor's race was a verdict on his presidency. Mr Biden argued that the miring of his legislative agenda in a Capitol Hill logjam did not sway the outcome. He cited ""Trump voters"", schools, jobs and petrol prices as other reasons for the surprise defeat of Terry McAuliffe. Republican Glenn Youngkin, a political newcomer, came from behind to win the Virginia governor's race on Tuesday.

US media have projected Mr Murphy will win that race, though his opponent has not yet conceded. At the White House on Wednesday, Mr Biden was asked whether he accepted any blame for Tuesday's political earthquake in Virginia. He said voters are ""upset and uncertain about a lot of things"", including the pandemic, education, the economy and the price of petrol.

Biden rejects blame for shock Virginia vote loss,"Joe Biden has rejected suggestions that his Democratic party's shock loss in the Virginia governor's race was a verdict on his presidency. Mr Biden argued that the miring of his legislative agenda in a Capitol Hill logjam did not sway the outcome. He cited ""Trump voters"", schools, jobs and petrol prices as other reasons for the surprise defeat of Terry McAuliffe. Republican Glenn Youngkin, a political newcomer, came from behind to win the Virginia governor's race on Tuesday.

What is lobbying?,"Tory MP Owen Paterson resigned his seat after being embroiled in a row around lobbying Westminster has been bursting with rebellions, U-turns and resignations this week after the Tory MP Owen Paterson was found to have broken parliamentary rules on lobbying. But what does the term mean? Lobbying is when individuals, businesses, trade unions, groups or charities try to get a government to change its policies. ""Political persuasion"" might be a better term. Lobbyists make their case to ministers, MPs or officials. They can write, email, text, phone, video call or turn up in person in Parliament to do it, although the latter hasn't happened much over the past two years due to Covid-19 restrictions. Paterson quits as MP over lobbying row 'nightmare' What did Owen Paterson do? Owen Paterson row: A quick but damaging U-turn Not always. Changing politicians' minds can take a long time. That's why organisations and firms often hire professional lobbyists to make arguments on their behalf. Some of these are former politicians themselves and ""know the game"" - that is, who's who and where to find them. But it's important to re-emphasise that individual citizens - unpaid - can also lobby politicians about issues that are important to them. Anyone can be a lobbyist, in other words. Supporters say professional lobbying is a vital and valid part of democracy - that it stimulates debate and keeps politicians in touch with the latest developments in areas like science and business. But critics argue that the current system is open to corruption and that wealthy interests - the ones who can afford professionals to make their case - have an unfair advantage. Ministers and top civil servants are effectively banned from lobbying their former colleagues for two years after leaving government. Lobbyists also have to join a register, which was set up by David Cameron as prime minister. But Mr Cameron, who left Downing Street in 2016, became the centre of a row about lobbying earlier in 2021over his work for Greensill Captial. In Mr Paterson's case, he wasfound to have broken the rulesby approaching and meeting officials at the Food Standards Agency and ministers at the Department for International Development a number of times over issues involving two firms he was a consultant for. The Commons Standards Committee also said he used his parliamentary office and stationery for his consultancy work and failed to declare his interests in some meetings. The commissioner decided that the contact with officials and ministers were ""serious breaches"" of the rules. Following the disclosures about Mr Cameron's work, the governmentset up a review of lobbying, led by lawyer Chris Boardman. He said some of the accusations that the government's processes for managing lobbying were ""insufficiently transparent"", had ""loopholes"" and allowed ""a privileged to few have a disproportionate level of access to decision makers in government"" were ""justified"". But he said Mr Cameron did not break any of the rules. After the incident involving Mr Paterson, the focus from the government was not on his lobbying but in the need for an overhaul of the system policing MPs' conduct instead - giving members more chances to appeal findings against them. Initially,Downing Street backed an amendmentto shake-up the watchdog and blocked Mr Paterson's suspension too. But within 24 hours, and after a furious backlash from opposition MPs,No 10 U-turned, and now government is appealing to other parties to hold cross-party talks about any chances. These would not be retrospectively applied to Mr Paterson's case though, and soon after the announcement,the MP resigned his seat. It started long ago when members of the public turned up in Parliament's lobby areas to let MPs know what needed to change. It's harder to get into that part of the building than it used to be because of tougher security, so meetings are just as likely to take place elsewhere, such as over dinner, in MPs' constituencies or via the phone.

JD Sports furious after forced to sell Footasylum,"JD Sports has hit out at the UK's competition watchdog after being forced to sell rival chain Footasylum. After an investigation, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) ruled that the takeover could lead to a ""worse deal"" for customers. But JD Sports criticised the move, calling the decision ""inexplicable"" and ""beyond logic"". Its chairman Peter Cowgill suggested that the CMA is in ""a minority of one in reaching this conclusion"". The CMA found that JD Sports was the closest alternative for Footasylum shoppers. However, the retailer has argued that one of the key areas of competition it faces is from brands such as Nike and Adidas selling their goods direct to consumers online. JD Sports' chairman Peter Cowgill noted that the CMA had acknowledged that these direct sales were a threat to the retailer, which, he said, made the competition body's decision puzzling. JD Sports boss rejects criticism of Â£4.3m bonus Brexit worse than feared, says JD Sports boss The deal to buy Footasylum was first announced in April 2019. The latest ruling by the CMA follows an in-depth investigation after the competition watchdog first blocked the Â£90m takeover last year. JD Sports appealed against a ruling by the CMA in September, saying it was ""perplexed"" by its decision not to include online sales to consumers by major brands. In an update on Thursday, the CMA found that the takeover of Footasylum would reduce competition even after taking into account the growth in online shopping. Half of 1,300 online shoppers surveyed by the competition watchdog said that they would go to JD Sports if they were unable to purchase their usual trainers or joggers at Footasylum. It suggested that customers would have fewer options and could face higher prices, fewer discounts, and less choice of products in-store as a result. Kip Meek, chair of the CMA inquiry group, said: ""The UK boasts a thriving sports fashion market and today's decision reflects our commitment to keeping it that way. ""We strongly believe shoppers could suffer if Footasylum stopped having to compete with JD Sports. It is likely they would pay more for less choice, worse service and lower quality."" It added that the rivals can continue to compete for shoppers online and as they return to the High Street. JD Sports argued on Thursday that the CMA in fact agreed with it on several fronts. It said, for example, that the CMA had found JD Sports' biggest competition came from international brands selling to consumers from their own websites or apps. JD Sports also said that it would have no incentive to raise prices or reduce deals for shoppers. JD Sports boss Peter Cowgill said the CMA's decision was ""inexplicable"" In a statement to investors, JD Sports said that ""the decision to prohibit the acquisition defies logic"", given that Footasylum has a market share of less than 5%. ""The CMA rightly concludes that, following the acquisition of Footasylum, JD would have no incentive to raise prices or worsen its offer as its most important competitors are the [Direct to Consumer] DTC operations of the international brands themselves,"" said Mr Cowgill. ""However, the CMA has then somehow concluded that the competitive threat from DTC does not extend to Footasylum and that JD would have an incentive to worsen the offer in Footasylum to the detriment of both consumers and suppliers. We would suggest that the CMA is in a minority of one in reaching this conclusion. ""Overall, the CMA's decision today continues to be inexplicable to anyone who understands what difference the pandemic has made to UK retail and how competition and the supply chain in our markets actually work."" Mr Cowgill added that the decision comes after the UK High Street has been seriously damaged by coronavirus-related lockdowns and could see further closures. The sportswear retailer has four weeks to lodge an appeal with the Competition Appeal Tribunal following the decision. JD said that it is studying the CMA's new report in detail and will consider its options ""carefully"". Despite the watchdog's decision, JD's share price rose by more than 3% on Thursday to Â£11.17. Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said that investors appeared to have ""shrugged off"" the news. ""The acquisition was part of the company's quest for dominance in the sportswear market,"" she said. ""But the decision by the CMA on the grounds that keeping Footasylum within the group would lead to a lack of choice for customers, indicates just how formidable JD Sports now is as an online powerhouse.""

'Gripping' South Africa saga wins Booker Prize,"This video can not be played This video has been removed for rights reasons South African author Damon Galgut has won the prestigious Booker Prize for fiction at the third attempt for his novel The Promise. Galgut, who was previously nominated in 2003 and 2010, picked up the Â£50,000 prize at a ceremony on Wednesday. The Promise is his ninth book and follows the decline of one South African family over four decades from the apartheid era to the present day. The chair of the judges, Maya Jasanoff, described it as ""a tour de force"". ""It combines an extraordinary story, rich themes and the history of the last 40 years of South Africa in an incredibly well-wrought package,"" she said. ""It manages to pull together the qualities of great storytelling, it has great ideas, it's a book that has a lot to chew on, with remarkable attention to structure and literary style."" The author said he was ""really profoundly, humbly grateful"" for the award. ""I'm not used to winning things,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Thursday. ""And I just assumed that would be the case last night. ""Perhaps nobody was more amazed than me when things went my way."" Damon Galgut had been nominated for the Booker Prize twice before Analysis by Rebecca Jones, BBC arts correspondent The Promise by Damon Galgut is an excellent winner. In my view it is an outstanding book and it is hard to disagree with the critic who said: ""This is so obviously one of the best novels of the year."" Why? On the one hand it is a gripping saga, following the decline and fall of a white South African family over four decades. It is packed with incident - sex, drugs, shootings - and there is drama, discord and death. But there is also plenty of unexpected comedy to lighten the mood. It made me laugh. On the other hand, through the lens of this one family, The Promise also deftly tells the story of South Africa and its troubled transition from apartheid state to multi-racial democracy. So it is rich with layers and yet it is compact, with fewer than 300 pages. It is also technically superb. There is an invisible narrator, who acts like a film camera. So you move fluidly from one location to another, from one character's point of view to another, sometimes within the same paragraph or page. At one point we fly into someone's dreams. At another we dive into the feelings of a pack of hyenas and even a family dog. Damon Galgut nearly died from cancer as a young child. In 2010 he told me it was the central, cataclysmic event of his life. Books provided comfort during his illness. When he finally recovered he was left with the overwhelming need to write. Now he has won one of the biggest prizes in publishing. The Promise begins in 1986 and revisits the family over the course of four funerals, each in a different decade and at a different point in the nation's journey. The title refers to a pledge that the white family's black maid would be given the house she inhabits and the land it stands on. Galgut, 57, grew up in Pretoria and told the Today programme that it also refers to the unfulfilled promise in South Africa after apartheid, the policy of racial segregation and discrimination enforced by the white minority government. Galgut was one of six writers to be shortlisted for the prize ""I'm far from alone in saying that I think, in 1994, in our first free elections, there was a sense of great promise in the air that South Africa could at last change its course and become a different sort of country, and I certainly don't think that promise has been fulfilled,"" he said. The ""portrait"" his book paints of modern South Africa ""is not a happy one"", he told reporters after the ceremony. ""I had no agenda in describing it that way, but things are not great with us right now, so you could read that as a warning or a portrait, I don't know, but South Africa has seen better days."" But he said his win was a sign that more attention was being paid to African literature. ""The fact that the Nobel Prize winner this year came from Africa, the fact that the Booker has gone to an African, would suggest that the volume is going up on Africa,"" he said. ""I hope that's a process that will continue and that people will take African writing a little more seriously, because there's a lot of great writing coming from us."" The Promise was widely praised when it was published in the UK in June, with The Guardian calling it ""stunning"", The Sunday Times describing it as ""bleak but superbly narrated"" and The Financial Times declaring it ""a complex, ambitious, brilliant work"". The other nominated books were: Anuk Arudpragasam - A Passage North Patricia Lockwood - No One Is Talking About This Nadifa Mohamed - The Fortune Men Richard Powers - Bewilderment Maggie Shipstead - Great Circle Last year's Booker Prize waswon by Douglas Stuart for Shuggie Bain. The Scottish author said the victory ""changed everything for me"", with the novel shooting up best-seller lists as a result and now being adapted into a TV series.

'Smear test saved my life',"Laura McAdam has urged women to attend smear test appointments after latest figures suggest almost a third did not show up last year A woman who had no cancer symptoms has told how a routine smear test saved her life. Laura McAdam was just 31 when a biopsy, taken during a colposcopy, confirmed she had cervical cancer. The diagnosis came two years after her regular test came back showing cell changes. Ms McAdam, 36, shared her story as part of a new Scottish government campaign which urges women not to ignore their smear test invitation. Uptake of cervical screening in Scotland has declined in recent years and in 2020/21 only 69.3% of those eligible attended appointments. This compares to 71.2% the previous year and 73.1% in 2018/19. Earlier this year the Scottish government confirmed that three women had died after beingwrongly excluded from Scotland's cervical cancer screening programme. Ms McAdam, from Ayrshire, said: ""I was diagnosed early thanks to attending a regular smear test and I'm so grateful that my cell changes were picked up early enough - it saved my life. ""I had no symptoms whatsoever before that, so I know first-hand how important it is to attend screenings, even if nothing seems wrong."" Cervical cancer kills two women every day in the UK but it is largely preventable and screening, which is offered to women aged 25 to 64, is the best way to protect against the disease. Dad's smear test campaign after partner's death 'Annual smear test might have saved my Fiona' MP 'lost most of cervix after delaying smear' Smear test fear 'cost my sister her life' Despite this almost one in three women in Scotland still don't go for the five-minute smear test. After her smear test showed cell changes, Ms McAdam attended check-up appointments every six months. When the results kept showing cell changes, she underwent a colposcopy - a procedure used to look at the cervix - in November 2016. A week later she received her cervical cancer diagnosis and in January 2017, Ms McAdam had a hysterectomy. She was scheduled in for a five-week course of precautionary chemotherapy and radiotherapy treatment. But a tear in Ms McAdam's bladder was detected shortly before the course was meant to start and her doctors decided to cancel the treatment. Following a bladder operation she now attends scans every six months to closely monitor her recovery. Ms McAdam, who volunteers with Jo's Cervical Cancer Trust which campaigns on the importance of cervical screening, said: ""I had a few niggly back pains as a result of the bladder operation, but other than that I feel absolutely fine now. ""All the hospital staff have been fantastic throughout all this and I can't thank them enough for their care."" The new campaign also provides tips and reassurance around the appointment to help women overcome barriers to attending, such as embarrassment or worry. Public Health Minister Maree Todd said: ""A five-minute smear test could save your life. Even if you expect everything is fine, it's important not to ignore your invite, as the test can help stop cervical cancer before it starts."" The test screens for human papillomavirus (HPV), the main cause of cervical cancer, and helps ensure cell changes are identified and treated earlier. She added that while some may feel anxious about the test information and advice is available to make the experience easier. Woman dies after Scottish cancer screening error Two more deaths linked to cancer screening error Earlier this year Ms Todd told the Scottish Parliament that about 600 women had been wrongly excluded from the cervical cancer screening programme following a partial hysterectomy. Three of those women have since died and the government strongly suspects that one developed cancer as a result of her exclusion. In June Ms Todd issued""heartfelt apologies""to the women who were excluded from the programme and went on to develop cervical cancer.

LiveLiveBiggest users fail to sign up to ending coal15 minutes ago,"Promises made at COP26 - if fully kept - would limit global warming to 1.8C, says the influential International Energy Agency It comes on day five of the global climate summit - the focus is on how the world can move away from fossil fuels More than 40 countries commit to shifting away from coal but huge users and producers like China, India, Australia and the US don't sign up Indonesia signals it may pull back from a pledge made this week on reversing deforestation COP26 president Alok Sharma says the ""end of coal is in sight"" but more work needs to be done Activist Greta Thunberg is scornful of COP26's inclusivity, calling it the ""Great North greenwash festival"" Edited by Paul Gribben Thank you for joining us for today's rolling coverage of COP26. It was edited by Paul Gribben. Our writers were Doug Faulkner, Bryn Palmer, Kelly-Leigh Cooper and Marie Jackson We'll be back again tomorrow - when the day's theme is youth and public empowerment. As young protesters gather in Glasgow, we will be hearing
directly from inspirational activists and young people already experiencing the
effects of climate change. And we'll be joined by Maisie and Nel, two BBC Young Reporters who will be with us as special guest journalists for the day. Here's a reminder of what has been happening today at COP26 - where there has been a focus on energy. A ship supplies feed to a salmon farm on the west coast of Scotland Chris Packham, the environmental campaigner and presenter of the BBC's Springwatch series, has visited COP26 and says the host country should ""get rid of highly polluting, nasty salmon farms"". The industry is said to be worth more than Â£1bn a year to the economy, with hundreds of thousands of fish raised in pens suspended in the open sea lochs around Scotland's west coast and the Northern Isles. The pens keep the fish - fed on processed feed - enclosed but they allow parasites to get in, with thousands of tonnes of waste getting into the surrounding water. Asked what more Scotland could be doing in the fight against climate change, Packham toldBBC Radio Scotland's Drivetimeprogramme that ""there are obviously elephants in
the room while there are salmon in those cages off the west coast"". He called for the industry to be ""transitioned out"" with investment so that people can be ""retrained into jobs that are far more harmonious and
sustainable"". Sameer HashmiMiddle East Business Correspondent Last month, Saudi Arabiaâs crown prince and de facto ruler,
Mohammed bin Salman, announced that the country had seta target of achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2060. For a long time, the worldâs largest oil exporter had
resisted calls from Western countries to set a definite target to reduce carbon
emissions. But, even as the Saudis seek to achieve that target, they are
boosting their oil production capacity to cater to global demand. The countryâs top officials have repeatedly said that
tackling climate change is necessary, but that it cannot be done by âdemonisingâ
hydrocarbons. The energy minister believes that the world needs both fossil
fuels as well as renewables. On the face of it, the kingdom has set an ambitious plan to
eliminate 278 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions per year by 2030, up
from a previous target of 130 million tonnes. It would involve investments of
$190bn (Â£139bn) during that period. But the task is not going to be easy. Saudi Arabia earns
more than half of its revenue from oil exports. Although the crown prince is
trying to promote economic diversification by investing in new industries, it is
going to take time for them to start contributing substantially to the economy. Google tells us that a lot of people seem to be searching online to find out when COP26 finishes. Well, there's quite a while left yet. Today is the fifth day of the conference, which will run up until Friday, 12 November. (But if previous COPs are any guide negotiations might carry on into the weekend.) Each day has a different theme with today's focus being energy and the transition to greener economies. All countries face problems getting their emissions down but China has the biggest challenge. Per person,China's emissions are about half those of the US, but its huge 1.4 billion population and explosive economic growth have pushed it way ahead of any other country in its overall emissions. While more than 130 countries have pledged to reach net zero emissions before 2050, China has said it's aiming for""carbon neutrality"" by 2060. It hasn't set out exactly what this means or how it will get there. Russiahas also pledged to reach net zero by 2060, although its draft commitment hasn't been legally ratified. Until recently President Vladimir Putin dismissed the risks posed by rising temperatures. Indiaset a net zero target for the first time at COP26, with a promise to cut emissions to net zero by 2070.  Vanessa Nakate (right) met Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon alongside Greta Thunberg earlier this week There is a focus on youth at COP26 on Friday - ahead of that, some activists have been speaking today at a New York Times fringe event. Nobel Peace Prize winner Malala Yousafzai and fellow campaigners Vanessa Nakate and Leah Thomas called for world leaders to listen to marginalised women and people of colour who are on the front line of the climate crisis. Yousafzai, a Pakistani education activist, said environmental catastrophes, including droughts and floods, affected education and so were not separate issues. Speaking via video-link she said: ""The consequences of climate change are not equal. Some of us are more vulnerable to the climate disasters than others."" Nakate, a climate activist from Uganda, said she does not accept that praise for young campaigners from politicians is genuine. ""They're are making us responsible - if it doesn't go well, then we failed to do it,"" she said, adding that she was putting the responsibility back on them. Kakembo's project transforms biodegradable plastics and organic waste into eco-friendly charcoal briquettes  BBC Minutehas been speaking to Kakembo Galabuzi Brian, a
young entrepreneur from Uganda whoâs at COP26 calling for more investment in
clean energy projects in developing nations. ""We need to present the community with better solutions,"" the 27-year-old says. ""Itâs very important to do it now before all the
resources run out and the Earth suffers."" His youth-focused project turns farm waste into fuel used for cooking - trying to ""replace firewood, so
we can keep the trees standing"". Kakemboâs eco-friendly work earned him the accolade of
Commonwealth Young Person of the Year in 2020. He argues that itâs hypocritical for wealthy nations to
expect poorer ones to switch to green energy sources unless they curb their own
use of fossil fuels - and offer a helping hand. âThere is no way you can tell the Ugandan government not to
explore oil unless you give them an incentive not to. So climate finance is a
really big deal for us.â We mentioned earlier aboutcriticism of the organisation and inclusivity of the COP26. Now Greta Thunberg, arguably the most well-known climate activist in the world, is doubling down on her criticism of the event. She describes the conference as the ""Great North greenwash festival"" in a tweet on Thursday. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Helen BriggsBBC environment correspondent in Glasgow Suggestions that warming could be limited to slightly under
2C if countries were to fully deliver on their commitments to reduce emissions should be treated with caution, according to two leading climate
experts. Number-crunching of revised pledges made in the run-up to
Glasgow suggest these could put the world on track to limit global warming to
1.8 or 1.9C. But Dr Carl Schleussner, of Climate Analytics, says even
under the most âoptimisticâ scenarios, governments are not yet delivering in
terms of âclosing the gap in the near termâ. And Prof Simon Lewis, of UCL, says with some targets for
peaking emissions set so far into the future, governments' commitments âneed to
be taken with a pinch of saltâ. The UN recently predicted that the world was heading for a
temperature rise of 2.7C, based on an analysis of pledges made for 2030,
excluding those in recent days. If you include net zero commitments made by
some countries from 2050 onwards, this falls to 2.2C. The predictions by the IEA and by a group of scientists in
Australia are based on revised emission plans that have come in recently from a
number of countries, including India, which aims to peak emissions in 2070. Thursday marks day five of the UN climate conference in Glasgow. Here are some images of the week so far: The climate conference got under way on Sunday, with world leaders among thousands travelling to Glasgow British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he remains ""cautiously optimistic"" about a deal to keep global temperature rise below 1.5C Prince Charles is among the attendees, seen here at an event with fashion designer and sustainability advocate Stella McCartney Climate activists - including Extinction Rebellion - have been protesting on the side of the summit There have also been less traditional demonstrations spotted on the sidelines too - including a group dressed up as Pokemon character Pikachu trying to encourage Japan to move away from coal Rebecca HenschkeAsia editor, BBC World Service When Indonesia, home to some of the worldâs most carbon-rich
forests and peatlands, signed up to a deal to halt and reverse deforestation, it
was seen as a significant step forward. But now the country's environment and forestry minister Siti
Nurbaya Bakar has released a statement onsocial
media,externalsaying that Indonesia ""canât promise what we canât do"". She said forcing Indonesia to commit to ""zero deforestation
in 2030 is clearly inappropriate and unfair"".  Despite President Joko
Widodo signing the forest deal, she said that development remained the
countryâs top priority. Minister Nurbaya argued that the countryâs vast natural
resources must be used for the benefit of its people and cited the need to cut
down forests to make way for roads.  Deforestation of Indonesia's peatland forests also threaten populations like orangutans Controversial road projects in remote areas of Borneo and Papua have opened up previously untouched rainforest and lead to a spike in illegal logging. Indonesians have responded negatively to the minister's social posts commenting that itâs often big businesses that profit off deforestation while local people are left to deal with floods and landslides. One user wrote: ""Letâs destroy all the forests, to get money minister. Then we might have money to pay for oxygen.â Ashitha NageshBBC News, London You might not think of climate protests as all-singing all-dancing - but for one activist group, thatâs exactly what they are. The group, BP or Not BP, specifically protest against oil companies giving large donations and sponsorships to cultural institutions like galleries, museums and theatres - something they say is a way for oil companies to enhance their reputations. Their first protest almost 10 years ago, in April 2012, was at the Royal Shakespeare Company. Since then theyâve done 62 ""protest-performances"" - including wheeling a large Trojan horse into the lobby of the British Museum for the museumâs Troy exhibition in February 2020. And in that time, several institutions have ended their relationships with oil companies - including Tate, the British Film Institute and the Royal Shakespeare Company. BP boss Bernard Looney responded to the protests last year when he set out an ambition for the oil company to ""reimagine energy"". âMany
question our motives in supporting the arts,"" he said. ""I get that. ""We are taking steps
to more firmly and visibly align our intentions with our actions and become
much more transparent.â Adam EastonWarsaw Correspondent A number of solar panels attached to the wall of an old house in the centre of Krakow As we reported earlier, Poland has pledged to phase out coal by the end of the 2040s,
reaffirming last yearâs agreement with trade unions to close down the last pit
by 2049. The countryâs abundant Silesian coal reserves have long fuelled the
economy and generate around 80 per cent of its electricity. But Polish power
generators must now pay for their CO2 emissions, and rising carbon costs have
rendered many plants unprofitable. After years of defiantly championing
its black treasure, Poland is now investing in renewable energy, particularly
offshore wind, and seeking EU funds to gradually close down its mines and
retrain its workers. The country now has
one of the fastest growing solar energy markets in the EU, largely due to
homeowners like Michal Dera. He replaced his
electric heating system at his home in Bedzin near one of Silesiaâs coal-fired
power plants with a heat pump and installed solar panels to generate
electricity. I made the change to have a heating system that produced fewer emissions as well as save money. We use electricity for heating the house, charging cars, cooking, lighting and other household needs. At current electricity prices the investment should pay off in 8-10 years.â Michal Dera Helen BriggsBBC environment correspondent in Glasgow Organisation of the Glasgow summit has drawn complaints,
with grumbling over the long queues to get in and restrictions for observers
following the negotiations. âThe worst COP ever,â said one COP veteran, Kenyan
policy expert Mohamed Adow. Some even went as far as to invoke the spectre of
Copenhagen, the climate talks that ended in disaster in 2009, haunted by images
of delegates queuing outside in the snow. On my journey through the Blue Zone,
my fellow queuers were fairly sanguine. Austin, from Edinburgh, had anticipated queues and felt things were running smoothly. Inside, a member of Ghanaâs
delegation blamed the queues on strict security due to Covid, while a delegate
from Tanzania said she was more concerned over restrictions that limit the
number of people from each country attending meetings. Others are less
sympathetic. Dr Kat Kramer, Christian Aidâs climate lead, with 10 COPs under
her belt, calls this the âleast inclusiveâ COP ever. She says restrictions on
civil society observers following the negotiations needs to be fixed âto
ensure vulnerable communities on the frontline of this crisis are fully
representedâ. And thereâs not enough seating or power points, she says,
and much longer queues than previous summits. âBasic logistics have been a
shambles,â she adds.  This video can not be played Climate change: 'We're seeing less snow on our Scottish mountains' On Wednesday, we reported that the UK's longest lasting patch of snow in the Highlands of Scotlandhas just disappeared for ""only the eighth time in 300 years"". BBC Young reporter Sofia, who knows that area well, has been looking into the impact of less frequent snowfalls on the hills. She's been talking to people around Aviemore in the Cairngorms to find out their concerns about having less snow and fewer snow days - and what that means for the planet. Matt McGrathEnvironment correspondent The joint statement on ending public financing for fossil fuel overseas,externalmay only have the support of
around 20 countries, but the fact that the US, the UK and Canada are among them
gives it weight. Funding will be removed from
all âunabatedâ oil and gas developments from the end of next year. This means
that there will be no cash for oil, gas and coal projects unless they capture
and bury the CO2 emissions that result from the burning of the fuel. Right now the countries
involved are spending around $18bn (Â£13bn) a year supporting fossil fuels abroad. There are some notable
absentees, though. China, Japan and South Korea are the worldâs biggest
financiers of overseas oil and gas and are not among the signatories. As well as the financing of
fossil fuels, thereâs also been a flurry of announcements here today on coal. While a lot of the talk at COP can feel abstract, the matter of coal is hitting home for one part of the UK. A new coal mine in Cumbria, in north-west England, could bring hundreds of well-paid jobs to the area - if it goes ahead. Right now the decision lies with planning inspectors but could fall into the hands of ministers. Boris Johnson, the UK prime minister, has said he doesn't want it to go ahead, telling COP26 he was""not in favour of more coal"". But Labour, the opposition party, has said the unresolved matter of a new UK coal mine is hampering the government's case at COP. Sir Keir Starmer, Labour party leader, said: ""Our ability to argue on the world stage that we should stop using coal is undermined by the government not, or at least flirting with the idea of opening a coal mine in Cumbria which would be a completely wrong step."" The UK should be moving ahead quickly towards safe, secure forms of energy, like hydrogen and wind, he said in an interview with BBC Radio Two's Jeremy Vine show. Read more on the controversy around the Cumbria coal minehere. Air pollution kills more than seven million people a year, Dr Jeni Miller of the Global Climate and Health Alliance tells the BBC, so phasing out fossil fuels and moving away from coal is a ""fantastic first step"". Climate change is taking its toll on so many of us, physically and mentally, she says, pointing to heatwaves in Canada, wildfires in Australia and flooding in Mexico. She adds that young people's mental health is being affected by the worries around climate change and those caught up in extreme weather were often left with PTSD. If the issue is not tackled, it's a fairly dire scenario, she warns, but if they can be addressed, there are benefits for us all. We've already heard from COP26 president Alok Sharma today and now he is giving a press conference. He says that ""coal is no longer king"" following the pledge by more than 40 countries to phase it out as a fuel. Sharma says that coal financing has ""been well and truly choked off"". But he says that despite the progress ""challenges are emerging"" as negotiators seek to formalise pledges - but he adds ""this is par for the course"". Sharma tells the press conference the transition from coal to clean energy ""must be just"" and says that so far through COP26 around $18bn have been pledged to help deliver this transition.

CO2 emissions show rapid rebound after Covid dip,"Global carbon dioxide emissions are set to rebound to near the levels they were at before Covid, in a finding that has surprised scientists. The amount of planet-heating gas released in 2020 fell by 5.4% as the pandemic forced countries to lock down. But a scientific report by the Global Carbon Project predicts CO2 emissions will rise by 4.9% this year. It shows the window is closing on our ability to limit temperature rise to the critical threshold of 1.5C. This rise in carbon dioxide (CO2) released into the atmosphere underlines the urgency of action at summits like COP26 in Glasgow, scientists say. Important deals have been struck at the meeting this week, on limiting emissions of methane and on curbing deforestation. Yet emissions from coal and gas are predicted to grow more in 2021 than they fell the previous year - though carbon released from oil use is expected to remain below 2019 levels. Can COP26 really save the planet? How many trees has the world been cutting down? UK firms forced to show how they will hit net zero Dr Glen Peters, from the Center for International Climate Research (Cicero) in Oslo, Norway, said: ""What many of us were thinking in 2020 - including me - was more of a recovery spread out over a few years, as opposed to a big hitch in 2021. ""That's where the surprise comes for me - that it happened so quick, and also there's a concern that there's still some recovery to come."" This rapid rebound in emissions is at odds with the ambitious CO2 cuts required in order to limit global temperature rise to 1.5C. This is the increase viewed by scientists as the gateway to dangerous levels of global warming. The 16th annual Global Carbon Budget report was compiled by more than 94 authors who analysed economic data and information on emissions from land activities, such as forestry. This video can not be played Climate Basics: CO2 explained It shows that, if we continue along as we are and don't cut emissions, there's a 50% likelihood of reaching the 1.5C of warming in about 11 years. This concurs with the findings in a recent UN reportthat suggested we would get there by the early 2030s.,external Prof Corinne Le QuÃ©rÃ©, from the University of East Anglia, said: ""To limit climate change to 1.5C, emissions of CO2 need to reach net zero by 2050. Doing this in a straight line would mean cutting global emissions down by 1.4 billion tonnes of CO2 each year."" The fall in 2020 was 1.9 billion tonnes, but that was in the lockdown. So reducing emissions by an amount roughly equivalent to that in the post-lockdown period presents a daunting challenge. But the scientists stress that it remains achievable. Climate change is one of the world's most pressing problems.Governments must promise more ambitious cuts in warming gases if we are to prevent greater global temperature rises. The summit in Glasgow is where change could happen.You need to watch for the promises made by the world's biggest polluters, like the US and China, and whether poorer countries are getting the support they need. All our lives will change.Decisions made here could impact our jobs, how we heat our homes, what we eat and how we travel. Read more about the COP26 summit here. ""Personally, I think [the 1.5C goal] is still alive, but the longer we wait, the harder it will get... we need immediate action and reductions,"" said co-author Pierre Friedlingstein, from the University of Exeter. Prof Le QuÃ©rÃ© concurred: ""This decrease of 1.4 billion tonnes each year is a decrease that is very large indeed, but is feasible with concerted action. We need to limit climate change as low as possible and 1.5C is a good target to maintain."" Emissions in China are expected to be 5.5% higher in 2021 than in 2019 and are also projected to rise in India, with a 4.4% increase in 2021 relative to the pre-pandemic level. Dr Peters said commentators should remember that, while China is responsible for nearly 30% of global carbon emissions, that left another 70% for the rest of the world to tackle. The superpower has also demonstrated weaker economic growth in the past decade and has been switching to low-carbon energy sources at a faster rate than many other countries. Its emissions growth this year is related to stimulus packages - focused on heavy industry - which are in turn a response to the Covid-related slowdown. Both India and China have plenty of installed renewables capacity. Here, workers clean solar panels in Gujarat, India ""China is doing very well on many dimensions: it's deploying solar, it's deploying wind, electric buses, electric vehicles, and so there's lots of positive things going on in China,"" Dr Peters explained. ""But unfortunately, the stimulus packages often tend to focus on industrial sectors - construction, steel, cement. This requires coal. ""If China can turn that around, it has plenty of potential to reduce emissions because it has so much potential for large-scale deployment of solar and wind [power] that other countries don't have."" At COP26 this week, India pledged to reach net zero - where its emissions are reduced and any remaining ones balanced out by projects such as tree planting - by 2070. Like China, it has installed lots of wind and solar capacity, but fossil fuel sources have also been growing. Projected 2021 emissions in the US, European Union and the rest of the world remain, respectively, 3.7%, 4.2%, and 4.2% below their 2019 levels - in large part due to policies designed to reduce emissions from fossil fuels.

Brexit minister in Paris for talks on fishing row,"Lord Frost and Clement Beaune met in Paris Brexit Minister Lord Frost has met France's Europe minister in Paris in an attempt to resolve a dispute over post-Brexit fishing rights. Tensions flared up last month after the UK and Jersey denied fishing permits to several French boats. France then threatened a series of measures against the UK unless more licences were granted by 2 November. But President Emmanuel Macron suspended the threats at the 11th hour ahead of more talks between the two sides. The French government has insisted that punitive measures - which could include a ban on British trawlers landing their catches in French ports and tighter customs checks on cross-Channel trade - remain ""on the table"" if a deal cannot be reached. Following the meeting, a UK government statement said the pair had ""discussed the range of difficulties arising from the application of the agreements between the UK and the EU"". It added that Lord Frost and Mr Beaune were expected to speak again early next week. France's Europe Minister Clement Beaunetweeted,externalhe was ""happy to receive"" Lord Frost in Paris to ""restart a necessary dialogue"". Lord Frost is now heading to Brussels on Friday to meet European Commission vice-president Maros Sefcovic to discuss problems of trading goods between mainland Britain and Northern Ireland following Brexit. France delays sanctions as fishing talks continue Who really owns UK fishing rights? This may be a negotiation over post-Brexit fishing rights, but it's a test of post-Brexit relations. Disputes over technical issues - such as how French boats must prove their right to fish in British waters - are framed by wider personal and political mistrust. Both sides are playing down expectations for the meeting today between David Frost and Clement Beaune. Paris says the UK is deliberately blocking applications and not respecting the deal it signed. London - for once round the table with a major EU member state - is said to want to broaden the agenda to include other issues, likethe Northern Ireland protocol. Triggered by the fate of a few dozen fishermen, this is just as much about the future relationship between France and post-Brexit Britain. It comes after a British trawler, which was detained last week after French authorities said it did not have a license,was released. The Scottish-registered scallop dredger Cornelis Gert Jan arrived back in the UK in the early hours of Thursday morning, after leaving Le Havre the previous evening. This video can not be played Jamie McMillan says it's cheaper and quicker to export his shellfish to Asia than it is France The trawler's skipper Jondy Ward still faces trial in France next August regardless of Wednesday's court ruling that the boat can be released. He has been charged with illegal fishing without a licence in French waters - but the case could be dropped before it reaches trial. Mr Ward said they had been ""caught in the middle"" of the political row. The crew of the Cornelis Gert Jan stand on the deck as they leave the northern French port of Le Havre In short, it's about how many French fishing boats can catch fish in UK waters. Under the Brexit trade deal, the EU and UK agreed they would give licences to boats if they can show they have fished in each other's waters for years. But there have been disagreements about how much evidence is needed. Big trawlers will routinely collect this information automatically. But smaller vessels that come from French harbours to fish around the Channel Islands, for example, can find it harder to provide the proof needed.

ICC to probe Venezuela for crimes against humanityThe International Criminal Court will examine allegations of torture and extrajudicial killings.Latin America & Caribbean,"More than 100 people died during a 2017 crackdown on anti-government protests The International Criminal Court (ICC) will investigate whether crimes against humanity were committed during Venezuela's crackdown on anti-government protests in 2017. Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro said the state respects the decision to investigate, but does not share it. More than 100 people died during the clampdown on protesters. The demonstrations started after the Supreme Court decided to dissolve the opposition-dominated National Assembly. The ICC's Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan announced the move after a three-day trip to Caracas. Venezuela crisis in 300 words Both Venezuela's opposition and its government have urged the ICC to investigate alleged crimes carried out by their opponents. Opposition leader Juan GuaidÃ³, who claims to be Venezuela's interim president and has the backing of more than 50 countries, welcomed the development. Writing on Twitter, he said it would enable the victims and their families to ""claim the right to obtain justice that has been denied in Venezuela"". Human Rights Watch said the investigation ""offers a pathway to justice for victims of atrocities"" by Mr Maduro's government. ""The ICC's first investigation in the Americas comes on the back of the extreme repression the Maduro government has inflicted on the Venezuelan people,"" JosÃ© Miguel Vivanco, Americas director at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement. Mr Khan said his job was to uphold the rule of law, not to settle political scores. ""I ask everybody now, as we move forward to this new stage, to give my office the space to do its work,"" he said. ""I will take a dim view of any efforts to politicise the independent work of my office."" Mr Maduro has complained that the government was not granted access to documents and information during the ICC's preliminary investigation in 2018. ""We were blind in that stage,"" the president said. Some 150 police and military members have been charged or sentenced for human rights violations over Venezuela's 2017 crackdown, according to the public ministry. The opposition says these prosecutions were simply an effort to avoid an ICC probe.

190 nations and organisations pledge to quit coal,"Coal produced around 37% of the world's electricity in 2019 More than 40 countries have committed to shift away from coal, in pledges made at the COP26 climate summit. Major coal-using countries including Poland, Vietnam and Chile are among those to make the commitment. But some of the world's biggest coal-dependent countries, including China and the US, did not sign up. In a separate commitment, 20 countries, including the US, pledged to end public financing for ""unabated"" fossil fuel projects abroad by the end of 2022. Such projects burn fossil fuels, like coal, oil and natural gas, without using technology to capture the CO2 emissions. Coal is the single biggest contributor to climate change. Signatories to the agreement have committed to ending all investment in new coal power generation domestically and internationally. They have also agreed to phase out coal power in the 2030s for major economies, and the 2040s for poorer nations, the UK said. Dozens of organisations also signed up to the pledge, with several major banks agreeing to stop financing the coal industry. ""The end of coal is in sight,"" UK business and energy secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said. ""The world is moving in the right direction, standing ready to seal coal's fate and embrace the environmental and economic benefits of building a future that is powered by clean energy."" But UK shadow business secretary Ed Miliband said there were ""glaring gaps"" from China and other large emitters, who have not committed to stop increasing coal use domestically. He also noted that there was nothing on the phasing out of oil and gas. Mr Miliband said the UK government ""has let others off the hook"". Tap or click to go through the gallery  Although progress has been made in reducing coal use globally, it still produced around 37% of the world's electricity in 2019. Countries like South Africa, Poland and India will need major investments to make their energy sectors cleaner. Juan Pablo Osornio, head of Greenpeace's delegation at COP26, said: ""Overall this statement still falls well short of the ambition needed on fossil fuels in this critical decade."" ""The small print seemingly gives countries enormous leeway to pick their own phase-out date, despite the shiny headline,"" he added. There's been such a flurry of announcements on the world's most polluting fossil fuel, that it's hard to see the light for all the (coal) dust. There are many questions outstanding. One of the biggest is the list of countries missing from this bonfire of coal commitments - including the US, China and India. The time scales for phase-out are also a bit woolly - with richer countries promising to end coal by the 2030s, with developing nations in the 2040s. None of these commitments are binding - again there is no big stick to force countries to do this. And how many of the plans to stop using coal in developing countries will need financial support from the developed world? We've already seen the UK, Germany and the US step up to pay South Africa's $8.5bn (Â£6.2bn) to move away from coal. Other countries are said to be interested in following in South Africa's footsteps. So is there also a question of the rich countries paying others to do what they struggle to do at home? While the US was notably absent from the coal commitments, it joined 19 other countries - including the UK, Canada and New Zealand - in pledging to stop financing unabated overseas fossil fuel projects. ""Investing in unabated fossil-related energy projects increasingly entails both social and economic risksâ¦ and has ensuing negative impacts on government revenue, local employment, taxpayers, utility ratepayers and public health,"" the signatories of the UK-led initiative said in a joint statement. The deal saw countries and financial institutions vow to steer their spending into clean energy instead. It allowed for exemptions in unspecified ""limited"" circumstances, but said these must be consistent with efforts to limit global temperature rises to 1.5C. ""Ending international finance for all unabated fossil fuels is the next critical frontier we must deliver on,"" UK energy minister Greg Hands said. ""We must put public finance on the right side of history."" However, major financers of such projects, such as China, Japan and South Korea, did not sign up. The countries did join G20 nations last month in agreeing to end financial support for new unabated coal plants overseas.

Waiting list patients 'ask if life's worth living',"Jill Davies was told there was a three-year waiting list for a new hip and said she could hardly walk A woman travelled to Lithuania for a hip replacement because the NHS in Wales faces such huge waiting lists. Jill Davies, from Birchgrove, Swansea, waited four years to see a consultant and was told there was a further three-year wait for an operation. It comes as a surgeon warned patients on waiting lists had been questioning whether their lives were worth living. The Welsh government said it wanted to ""radically transform"" how healthcare was delivered. Welsh ambulances face unprecedented pressure, minister says Waiting times hit record levels Ms Davies, 66, a retired head teacher, was told in 2016 she had arthritis in both hips and that it was more severe in her right, but only in December 2020 was she referred to a hip consultant. ""By that time I could not really walk,"" she said. ""I was down to walking like 25 metres, using a stick all the time. If I went shopping I used to hire one of the scooters because I was lacking in mobility at that time."" When she finally saw the consultant this year he told her he would put her on the waiting list for an operation, but that it would take three years. ""At that point I burst into tears,"" Ms Davies said. She was ""absolutely flattened"" so decided to go to Lithuania for treatment. She contacted a clinic on 1 July, flew out on the 22nd and had her operation on 24 July, followed by a 10-day intensive rehabilitation programme. ""I'm in no pain,"" she said. ""I can walk, I'm swimming, I can drive and do what I want to do. I've got my life back."" Surgeon Paul Williams said the effect of long delays on mental and physical health was ""horrific"" Paul Williams, an orthopaedic surgeon at Neath Port Talbot Hospital, said the effect of long delays on mental and physical health was ""horrific"". He said: ""To be living with pain from an arthritic joint is terrible. ""We sent out a questionnaire recently and many of the patients have actually replied that they're questioning if their life is worth living because of the pain they're in."" The latest figures for the Welsh NHS showed another record high for those waiting for hospital treatment. The number of patients waiting more than 36 weeks has grown from 25,634 in February 2020 to 243,674 by August 2021. The longest waits included 56,279 people who needed orthopaedic or trauma treatment. The overall waiting list for treatment is a record 657,539 -  just over a fifth of the Welsh population. In the Swansea Bay health board, which covers Swansea county and Neath Port Talbot, problems were exacerbated when elective surgery at Morriston Hospital was postponed for seven months in 2019, before the Covid pandemic hit. The health board said it planned to transform services with its three hospitals focusing on different things to protect surgery from emergency needs or winter pressures. Neath Port Talbot Hospital will become an orthopaedic centre of excellence, with investment approved by the Welsh government for four new theatres. Orthopaedic surgeon and Singleton and Neath Port Talbot hospitals' medical director, Dougie Russell, said: ""Now the pandemic's happened it's given us an opportunity to reset the whole system. ""This is our opportunity to get ourselves on a level footing."" The Royal College of Surgeons said regional hubs concentrating on routine surgery should be introduced across Wales to cope with the backlog. Mr Williams said: ""Orthopaedics has always been seen as an area where patients can wait a bit longer and a bit longer, and perhaps a bit longer still, but you can't put a price on that."" Plans for the three hospitals come as a Welsh government conference meets on Thursday to discuss tackling waiting times. Health Minister Eluned Morgan said she would invest another Â£170m a year to ""transform"" planned care. She will tell the meeting she hopes extra cash will ""build a planned care system that is bigger, better and more effective than we have seen before"". Director of the Bevan Commission think tank, Helen Howson, said fixing record waiting times would be the biggest challenge facing the NHS since its creation. She said the disruption Covid caused should force it to address problems that existed before the pandemic. The Welsh government said it wanted health boards to ""radically transform"" the way planned healthcare was delivered. As well as the Â£170m, Ms Morgan will outline Â£1m for a fund to help health boards to innovate. She said: ""The impact of the pandemic on planned care has been significant, resulting in a massive backlog of patients waiting for planned treatments. ""We need a whole system approach to how care is delivered and by investing Â£248m in Covid recovery, Â£170m in planned care and Â£42m in social care, we hope to put NHS Wales in a stronger position for future generations."" Eluned Morgan said there was a ""massive backlog of patients"" NHS Wales chief executive, Judith Padgett, said: ""We need to transform the way we deliver services. Many advancements and new ways of working have come online during the pandemic, but it is important to build on these and use the opportunity to create modern health and social services for the future.""

'Tour de force' novel wins Booker PrizeSouth African author Damon Galgut wins the prestigious literary award at the third attempt.Entertainment & Arts,"This video can not be played This video has been removed for rights reasons South African author Damon Galgut has won the prestigious Booker Prize for fiction at the third attempt for his novel The Promise. Galgut, who was previously nominated in 2003 and 2010, picked up the Â£50,000 prize at a ceremony on Wednesday. The Promise is his ninth book and follows the decline of one South African family over four decades from the apartheid era to the present day. The chair of the judges, Maya Jasanoff, described it as ""a tour de force"". ""It combines an extraordinary story, rich themes and the history of the last 40 years of South Africa in an incredibly well-wrought package,"" she said. ""It manages to pull together the qualities of great storytelling, it has great ideas, it's a book that has a lot to chew on, with remarkable attention to structure and literary style."" The author said he was ""really profoundly, humbly grateful"" for the award. ""I'm not used to winning things,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Thursday. ""And I just assumed that would be the case last night. ""Perhaps nobody was more amazed than me when things went my way."" Damon Galgut had been nominated for the Booker Prize twice before Analysis by Rebecca Jones, BBC arts correspondent The Promise by Damon Galgut is an excellent winner. In my view it is an outstanding book and it is hard to disagree with the critic who said: ""This is so obviously one of the best novels of the year."" Why? On the one hand it is a gripping saga, following the decline and fall of a white South African family over four decades. It is packed with incident - sex, drugs, shootings - and there is drama, discord and death. But there is also plenty of unexpected comedy to lighten the mood. It made me laugh. On the other hand, through the lens of this one family, The Promise also deftly tells the story of South Africa and its troubled transition from apartheid state to multi-racial democracy. So it is rich with layers and yet it is compact, with fewer than 300 pages. It is also technically superb. There is an invisible narrator, who acts like a film camera. So you move fluidly from one location to another, from one character's point of view to another, sometimes within the same paragraph or page. At one point we fly into someone's dreams. At another we dive into the feelings of a pack of hyenas and even a family dog. Damon Galgut nearly died from cancer as a young child. In 2010 he told me it was the central, cataclysmic event of his life. Books provided comfort during his illness. When he finally recovered he was left with the overwhelming need to write. Now he has won one of the biggest prizes in publishing. The Promise begins in 1986 and revisits the family over the course of four funerals, each in a different decade and at a different point in the nation's journey. The title refers to a pledge that the white family's black maid would be given the house she inhabits and the land it stands on. Galgut, 57, grew up in Pretoria and told the Today programme that it also refers to the unfulfilled promise in South Africa after apartheid, the policy of racial segregation and discrimination enforced by the white minority government. Galgut was one of six writers to be shortlisted for the prize ""I'm far from alone in saying that I think, in 1994, in our first free elections, there was a sense of great promise in the air that South Africa could at last change its course and become a different sort of country, and I certainly don't think that promise has been fulfilled,"" he said. The ""portrait"" his book paints of modern South Africa ""is not a happy one"", he told reporters after the ceremony. ""I had no agenda in describing it that way, but things are not great with us right now, so you could read that as a warning or a portrait, I don't know, but South Africa has seen better days."" But he said his win was a sign that more attention was being paid to African literature. ""The fact that the Nobel Prize winner this year came from Africa, the fact that the Booker has gone to an African, would suggest that the volume is going up on Africa,"" he said. ""I hope that's a process that will continue and that people will take African writing a little more seriously, because there's a lot of great writing coming from us."" The Promise was widely praised when it was published in the UK in June, with The Guardian calling it ""stunning"", The Sunday Times describing it as ""bleak but superbly narrated"" and The Financial Times declaring it ""a complex, ambitious, brilliant work"". The other nominated books were: Anuk Arudpragasam - A Passage North Patricia Lockwood - No One Is Talking About This Nadifa Mohamed - The Fortune Men Richard Powers - Bewilderment Maggie Shipstead - Great Circle Last year's Booker Prize waswon by Douglas Stuart for Shuggie Bain. The Scottish author said the victory ""changed everything for me"", with the novel shooting up best-seller lists as a result and now being adapted into a TV series.
