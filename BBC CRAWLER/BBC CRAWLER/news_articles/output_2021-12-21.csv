Sunak sets out Â£1bn fund for Covid-hit businesses,"This video can not be played Watch Rishi Sunak discuss the government's stance on any potential Covid restrictions this Christmas Chancellor Rishi Sunak has set out a Â£1bn fund to help businesses hit by the rise in Covid cases, including the leisure and hospitality sector. Hospitality businesses like pubs and restaurants will be able to apply for cash grants of up to Â£6,000 per premises. The government would also help some firms with the cost of sick pay for Covid-related absences, Mr Sunak said. And he announced an extra Â£30m to help theatres and museums. Many hospitality and leisure firms have been hit by a collapse in bookings and reduced footfall due to people's fears over the spread of the Omicron variant. Mr Sunak said the new support was ""generous"" and recognised the situation facing businesses in the run-up to Christmas. Some industry figures have welcomed what they described as ""unprecedented"" support, but others said the measures do not go far enough. Businesses other than hospitality and leisure can apply for some of the funding. However, the chancellor would not be drawn on whether more help would come should further restrictions be announced, as ministers come under pressure to tackle the rapid rise of Omicron. No new Covid rules for England before Christmas Scotland: Hogmanay events cancelled as Covid rules tightened Mixed reaction to latest Covid package for firms Tough new ruleshave been brought in in Scotland,with a limit on the number of people allowed to attend large events and Edinburgh's Hogmanay street party being cancelled. Another 90,629 new Covid cases were reported across the UK on Tuesday - slightly down on the all-time highs announced last week. The announcement on Tuesday means: Restaurants, bars, cinemas and theatres can apply for a grant of up to Â£6,000 for each of their premises. The Treasury is setting aside Â£683m for these grants and it will be provided under existing council-run schemes Other struggling businesses outside leisure and hospitality can apply to local councils for a different grant under the Additional Restrictions Grant, which has been topped up with Â£102m The Statutory Sick Pay Rebate Schemeis being reintroduced,meaning business with fewer than 250 employees can claim money to cover sick pay for employees who are affected by Covid An extra Â£30m for arts organisations through the existing Culture Recovery Fund. Asked if more support would be offered, the chancellor said he would ""always respond proportionately and appropriately to the situation we face"". But he added that he thought the new measures announced were comparable to the grants that were on offer when businesses were fully closed earlier this year. The UK's devolved administrations are also receiving Â£154m of funding to cover all three schemes, with around Â£80m for Scotland, Â£50m for Wales and Â£25m for Northern Ireland. This money is part of a fundannounced earlier this week.,external Challenged on whether he could rule out any more restrictions before the new year, Mr Sunak said he understood people's frustrations but the UK faced a very uncertain situation over Omicron. He echoed the prime minister's comments on Monday, saying ministers were keeping the situation under review and monitoring the data ""day-by-day, hour by hour"" but ruling nothing out. However, Labour's shadow Treasury minister Pat McFadden described Mr Sunak's announcement as ""a holding package from a government caught in a holding position"". Mr McFadden said the support was ""welcome"" but that it should have been announced last week when MPs voted to pass the government's Plan B measures. In the past, government support has been extended when government policy has restricted businesses ability to trade - so this is an important recognition that consumer caution can be almost as damaging as mandatory closure. The question then is - is this it? The chancellor said that the government has always responded when necessary but he was also at pains to point out that this level of grant funding was similar in generosity to those given during lockdown. A hint perhaps that this is as good as it gets - for grant funding at least. Business groups have welcomed today's move, but are clear that plenty of hardship lies ahead in the next year when business rates bills (albeit discounted) come due and the VAT discount wears off on 1 April. The British Chambers of Commerce and others would like to see a sector specific furlough scheme if firms are forced to close their doors. Perhaps most crushing of all for business confidence is the ongoing uncertainty, and with Covid-19 that is something over which the chancellor has little control. The reaction from businesses has been mixed. Shevaun Haviland, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said the new support would provide ""welcome respite"" to many firms affected by Covid measures, but warned that more could be needed if restrictions persist or are tightened. And Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UK Hospitality, welcomed the ""unprecedented support"" announced by Mr Sunak. But Michael Kill, chief executive of the Night Time Industries Association, said ""mixed"" government messaging and further restrictions had had a ""catastrophic impact"" on nightclubs and other late-night venues over the past two weeks. He described the chancellor's support package as ""far too little"" and said it bordered ""on the insulting"" in the face of failing businesses, lost livelihoods, and a ""crippled"" industry. A pub owner from Stoke-on-Trent has said he expects to receive just under Â£2,700 in support, rather than the headline Â£6,000 - as the system is based on business rates, so larger chains will be the ones to benefit from the top end of support. Rob Ledgar told BBC Radio 4's PM programme he was around 40 to 60% down on his normal festive turnover and the funding only represents ""about seven to 10 days worth of trade over Christmas"". Meanwhile, other business owners have urged the government to provide certainty about the Covid situation, rather than handouts. Nathan Godley, from restaurant supply firm Premier Seafoods in Grimsby, Lincolnshire, said that while he did not qualify for or want government support, he wanted certainty so he could plan orders in advance and avoid losing money or stock. He told BBC Radio 4's World at One there had been a drop in orders from restaurants in the last week as people cancelled bookings and that he would have to make ""contingency plans"" to preserve and freeze the fish until it could be sold in the new year. Meanwhile, theUK's devolved nations have already announced extra measures to combatthe surge of the Omicron variant: In Scotland, from Boxing Day all outdoor events will be limited to just 500 people and the numbers at indoor events will also be cut to 200 if seated and 100 if standing. The rules will be in place for at least three weeks In Wales, spectators will be banned from all sports events from 26 December, nightclubs will close from 27 December and social distancing will return in shops and workplaces after Christmas In Northern Ireland, there is a limit of 30 on people mixing from different households in homes, face coverings are compulsory in shops and other venues and a Covid passport is needed to enter nightclubs, bars and cinemas Last week, Mr Johnson advised people to ""think carefully before you go"" out to socialise. England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty also urged people not to ""mix with people you don't have to"". Do you run a hospitality business affected by the pandemic?

Hogmanay events cancelled as Covid rules tightened in Scotland,"This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon says Scotland's large-scale Hogmanay celebrations ""will not proceed"" Edinburgh's Hogmanay events have been cancelled and football matches will be effectively spectator-free as part of tough new Covid rules in Scotland. All outdoor events will be limited to just 500 people to help slow the spread of Omicron. Indoor events such as concerts will be limited to 200 people if they are seated, or 100 for standing. The new restrictions come into force on Boxing Day. They will be in place for three weeks - although there will be no limit to how many people can meet up at Christmas. The Old Firm derby between Celtic and Rangers on 2 January and the Edinburgh derby between Hearts and Hibs the following day are among the football fixtures that will be affected by the new rules. Crowds vastly reduced for Scottish sport What are the Covid rules in Scotland? Edinburgh cancellation 'incredibly sad' The government fears that last Sunday's League Cup Final in front of a capacity crowd at Hampden may have been a ""super spreader"" event, with Deputy First Minister John Swinney saying he regrets not making the decision to play matches without spectators sooner. Celtic have asked for the Scottish Premiership's three-week winter break - which is due to start after the Edinburgh derby on 3 January - to bebrought forwardto ""maximise the prospect of all supporters being able to attend matches and support the game they love."" All of the major Hogmanay events in Edinburgh - including the street party, the torchlit precession and the midnight firework display - have now been cancelled, as have many other events in towns and cities across the country. Edinburgh's annual torchlight procession, which takes place on 30 December, has also been cancelled Physical distancing of 1m will now need to be in place for all events that do go ahead under the restrictions. Pubs and other hospitality venues selling alcohol will need to reintroduce table service from 27 December. And indoor hospitality and leisure venues will be required to ensure there is a 1m distance between groups of people who are attending together - which could force nightclubs to close. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: ""This will of course make sports matches, including football, effectively spectator-free over this three week period. ""And it will also mean that large-scale Hogmanay celebrations - including that planned here in our capital city - will not proceed"". Wales had already announced plans for sporting events to beheld without crowdsfrom Boxing Day, and London hascancelled its New Year's Eve eventin Trafalgar Square. Many concerts, theatre productions and other events had already been cancelled voluntarily in Scotland. The Celtic-Rangers match on 2 January will be one of the fixtures affected by the new rules Omicron is now thought to account for 62.9% of all Covid cases in Scotland, with the first minister saying there was ""still no compelling evidence that Omicron is intrinsically milder than previous strains"". Ms Sturgeon said the much higher transmissibility of the new variant meant that large gatherings ""have the potential to become very rapid super-spreader events, putting large numbers at risk of getting infected very quickly"". She added: ""Limiting these events helps reduce the risk of widespread transmission. It also cuts down the transmission risks associated with travel to and from such events ""And these large events put an additional burden on emergency services, especially the police and ambulance services. ""At a time when these services are already under severe pressure and also dealing with high staff absences, limiting large scale events will help them focus on delivering essential services to the public."" Pubs will need to reintroduce table service from 27 December Ms Sturgeon stressed that the priority for the government was to ensure that schools re-open as normal after the Christmas holidays. And she again urged people to cut their contacts with people in other households as much as possible ahead of Christmas, and to stay at home as much as possible. The Federation of Small Business said the new measures would make trading ""drastically more difficult for huge numbers of small businesses in Scotland"". Its policy chair, Andrew McRae, said: ""The social distancing restrictions will mean shops and hospitality firms can serve fewer customers. ""And the changes to events, such as sports matches and Hogmanay celebrations, will have a knock-on impact on local economies."" The Scottish Licensed Traders Association said the restrictions would be a ""knockout blow""  to many businesses that were already struggling because of the pandemic. The Scottish government will now double the Â£100m it had already pledged to businesses hit by new Omicron restrictions. And Ms Sturgeon said recent announcements by the UK Treasury ""give us additional spending power now of Â£175m"" - bringing the total to Â£375m, all of which will be allocated to business support. While there are no changes to the rules and advice for Christmas gatherings, significant new restrictions will take effect as we head towards the new year. Edinburgh's Hogmanay is off for the second year in a row and big football matches can only be played before the smallest of crowds. The return of one metre distancing indoors will reduce the capacity of pubs and restaurants, theatres and cinemas - reducing their potential turnover too. There is fresh financial help worth Â£275m from the Scottish government which draws on additional funding announced by the UK Treasury at the weekend. Even though that's on top of an initial Â£100m earmarked by Holyrood ministers last week - it is unlikely to be nearly enough to offset the economic damage restrictions will cause. The first minister has renewed calls for the Chancellor to re-introduce a furlough scheme - something the Treasury has not included in the support package it announced today. Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said he understood the ""frustration and anger"" that many people would have over the new restrictions, but urged people to come forward for vaccination as the ""best way out of this"". He also called for household contacts of Covid cases to be allowed to end their self-isolation if they test negative, saying the current rules were well-intentioned but could ""grind our transport network, our economy and public services to a halt"". ScotRail cancelled more than 100 trains on Monday, largely because of crew members being affected by Covid. Ms Sturgeon said the government was ""actively considering"" changing household isolation rules once the booster campaign is complete, but said it would be ""counter-productive"" to do so while case numbers are rising. Meanwhile Scottish Labour's Anas Sarwar said there should be ""much more significant financial support"" for businesses and a ""furlough-type scheme"" for sectors which are effectively shut down.

"How Hasti, 7, and her family died in the English Channel","  In the freezing waters of the English Channel, a group of men, women and children are treading water and holding each other’s hands to stay afloat. Some are making desperate calls to rescuers on mobile phones held above the waves. But, as hypothermia sets in, their devices slip from their hands before they can send their location. The dinghy in which they had hoped to reach British shores has a broken motor and is deflating. One member of the group manages to send a voice message home. Just hours later, all but two of at least 30 people are dead - the worst migrant mass drowning in the Channel ever recorded. What went wrong? Here we piece together the final hours of the group - through survivors’ testimony, mobile phone messages, shipping data and the emergency response. As dusk falls, 22-year-old Hadiya Rzgar Hussein, her seven-year-old sister Hasti, brother Mubin, 16, and mum Kazhal, 46, gather their belongings together at the makeshift camp at Grande-Synthe, where they have been staying for several weeks.  They are tired and scared. French police recently dismantled the Grande-Synthe site, evicted its occupants and destroyed the family’s tent - and they are desperate to reach their relatives in the UK. To do this, they need to brave the so-called “death route” across the English Channel, paying people-smugglers to get them there on small, cheap inflatable boats. While the white cliffs of Dover are visible from some of this coastline on a clear day, the crossing is fraught with danger. It is one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes and those crossing must navigate freezing air and sea temperatures, and dangerous currents. The English Channel is one of the world’s busiest shipping routes At its shortest, it is just 21 miles (33km) across the Channel From the beaches near Dunkirk it is around 38 miles (61km) to the English coast Hadiya and her family have already tried to make it across three times before. Once they were turned back by police, once they ran out of fuel and on the third attempt the boat’s engine failed. But Hadiya’s dreams of becoming a doctor drive her and her family onwards. As evening draws in, the family are told by smugglers the time is right to leave and they join at least 28 others on board an arranged bus to Loon-Plage, a stretch of coastline between Dunkirk and Calais. The BBC has established 20 of these passengers were from Iraqi Kurdistan. The journey to the beach is short - just 10 minutes - and many on the bus begin to contact family back home to let them know they are about to leave France. Best friends Rezhwan Yasin Hassan, 19, Zanyar Mustafa Mina, 20 and Mohammed Qadir Aulla, 21, all from Iraqi Kurdistan, are among those messaging home from a shared phone.  A little later, another group of friends and acquaintances, who were also on the bus, contact their families in Iraq from several shared phones. The youngest are Pshtiwan Rasul Farka and Twana Mamand Mohammed, both 18, and 19-year-old Mohammed Hussein Mohammed. Also travelling with them are “Hybar” Bryar Hamad Abdulrahman, 23, Afrasia Ahmed Mohammed, 27, “Harem” Serkaut Perot Muhammad, 28, Shakar Ali Pirot, 30, and Hassan Mohammed Ali, 37. Among them is one Iranian, Sirwan Alipour, 23.  Bryar (pictured above, top-right) calls his mum and says he will contact her “when on the other side of the Channel”. Hadiya, the 22-year-old hoping to train as a doctor, texts her father - the man who made this trip possible. He sold the family home and borrowed money to raise the $42,000 (£32,000) needed. Iraqi Kurd “Baran” Maryam Nuri Mohamed Amin 24, trying to reach her fiance in the UK, and her friend, 32-year-old Mhabad Ahmad Ali, are also getting on the boat.  To go ahead with the launch, conditions need to be right – no police patrols, clear skies and a calm sea. At about 22:00 French time, traffickers give the migrants the final green light to cross. Some rescuers call such times “migrant weather” because it is when many decide to make the journey. But they warn it is not the wind that is the biggest challenge. It is the freezing air and sea temperatures.  A number of dinghies are dug up from their hiding places along the dunes, where they have been kept out of view of the police. At least six boats are launching that night. Hadiya and her family along with everyone else on the bus are allocated a 10m- (33-ft-) long, rubber inflatable dinghy with a motor attached at the rear. A boat like this can be bought second-hand for £400 ($531). It has no solid base and isn’t designed to safely carry more than 20 people. But this small dinghy leaves France with a human cargo of at least 32 adults and children on board. The boat pushes out into the open waters and Pshtiwan sends his last voice message home - the dinghy motor heard in the background. Overloaded, the boat makes slow progress - partly because of its excess weight - as it heads north-west into the night. Its passengers cling on to each other, and to the sides of the vessel, as the waves increase in size. Another group of migrants making the same journey just an hour later describe “big waves and stormy weather”. They are left soaking wet and freezing cold. Some are also seasick, and they end up aborting their journey and returning to France. Hadiya and her group begin to run into difficulties. As the boat reaches the middle of the Channel, its right side begins to deflate and the vessel starts taking on water. Baran messages her fiance in the UK, Karzan, on Snapchat. She describes how the boat is losing air and is taking on water, but jokes and tries to reassure him things will be fine. Those steering the boat are trying hard to keep it afloat, she says, and she is sure that the authorities will rescue them soon. Passengers begin to debate flagging down a ship they have spotted in the distance, but the consensus is they should push on to Britain. But worse is to come. A short time later, the boat’s engine cuts out, leaving the vessel and its passengers at the mercy of the Channel’s currents. The boat begins to be swallowed by the waves. As they are plunged into the freezing water, the group cling together and to what’s left of the deflated dinghy, to stop themselves drifting away from each other. They have travelled at least 30km (19 miles) from the beach where they first departed. BBC analysis of the current and ship tracking data suggests they are now near the maritime line that marks the start of British territorial waters. As they hold each other’s hands, those who can, including 16-year-old Mubin - Hadiya’s little brother - phone both the French and English authorities for help. Mid-conversation with her fiance, Baran drops off Snapchat. At least two of the group get through to the British authorities on the phone, who ask for the group’s location and tell them to keep their mobile torches on. But those passengers’ phones fall into the water before they can send the details, survivors say. Around this time, Shakar Ali Pirot sends a voice message to his family. He says if he is saved he will toss his phone into the waves - something many migrants have told the BBC they are ordered to do by smugglers to protect the people-traffickers’ identities. Some also say they do it to hide details that may prevent their asylum claims being accepted once on UK soil. Shakar’s voice message is believed to be the last known communication from the boat. According to the WhatsApp exchange between Shakar and his family, seen by the BBC, his phone stays online until 04:14 French time, but he sends no more messages. The boat is now completely submerged and all the passengers are treading water. Hypothermia sets in. He is a strong swimmer and he makes for a nearby vessel. A second migrant boat - which set off after the one carrying Hadiya and her family - arrives in the middle of the Channel. In the early morning light they see bodies in the water. The passengers of that boat call the French authorities for help. This second dinghy later arrives safely in the UK. Nearly 12 hours have passed since Hadiya and her group fell into the water. Then just before 14:00, 37-year-old French fisherman Karl Maquinghen and his crew, on board their trawler Saint Jacques II, spot 15 bodies in the water. Karl says many of the victims wearing life jackets had not connected the crotch strap correctly, which would have made it harder for them to keep their heads above water. Karl and his crew quickly raise the alarm and the nearby French navy vessel, FS Flamant - about 5km (3 miles) away - responds. The FS Flamant arrives at the scene, just inside French territorial waters A British coastguard helicopter joins the search and spots debris in the water, a few kilometres to the north-east The focus of the search shifts and by 15:45 two French coastguard vessels arrive at the new location The deflated dinghy, the rest of the dead and the two survivors are found 6km (4 miles) from where the first bodies are seen A total of 27 bodies are recovered, including those of seven women, two teenagers and one young girl. The two survivors claim the dinghy had crossed over into British waters. They say they continued to make desperate calls to both the British and French authorities, but were told by both sides to call the other. It is broadly accepted that a country has responsibility for maritime rescues in its territorial waters, although anyone finding a vessel in distress is expected to help with a rescue.  The French maritime authorities (the Maritime Prefecture of the Channel and the North Sea) say they were “not aware this boat was in difficulty prior to the alert raised by a fishing vessel”, referencing the Saint Jacques II. They add that on that same night, 106 people were saved during three different operations. However, according to the French newspaper Le Monde, a source inside the official police investigation has revealed that the itemised phone bills of the survivors confirm claims they called the French authorities for help. The UK Home Office maintains the boat was never in British territory and has rejected any claims they failed to respond to the sunken vessel. Analysis exclusive to the BBC suggests the migrant boat came close to, but never entered UK waters. Weather and water-current data from that location throughout the day suggests the boat would certainly have been pushed around, but we can deduce from the location the migrants were found in, and the direction of the currents, that waves would not have pushed them back from British waters. The BBC has confirmed at least 30 people died that night - by far the worst migrant tragedy ever recorded in the Channel. We have established, through help from many families in Iraqi Kurdistan, the identities of 20 of those on board. This includes Hadiya and her family, including her seven-year-old little sister Hasti.  There is also Baran and her friend Mhabad; best friends, Rezhwan and Mohammed Qadir, and young men Afrasia, Bilind, Bryar, Harem, Hassan, Mohammed Hussein, Muslim, Shakar and Sirwan. The body of Zanyar - Rezhwan and Mohammed’s best friend - has not yet been recovered. Pshtiwan and Twana are also still missing.   All of them were economic migrants and nearly all of them had previously tried - and failed - to get to Britain via legal routes multiple times. They had all also attempted to cross the Channel at least three, and in some cases six, times before in small boats. The French authorities told the BBC 10 other passengers who died have been identified as three Ethiopians, a woman from Somalia, four men from Afghanistan, a man from Egypt and one person from Vietnam. For Rzgar Hussein Mohammed, the pain of losing his wife and three children to the waters that night is too much to bear.  A month on, despite freezing temperatures, hundreds of migrants have continued to cross the Channel each week. Evicted from their makeshift camps by the French police in Calais, many say they have little choice but to take their chances with the Channel’s waves.

OnlyFans reported a sharp rise in users during Covid lockdowns. It has 180 million registered users and over two million creators worldwide, the firm said. It has paid out over $5bn (Â£3.7bn) to its content creators since it first started trading five years ago, it said. But it has faced criticism for not doing enough to prevent under-age users selling explicit content. In August the site announced that all sexually explicit photos and videos would be blocked from October, following pressure from banking partners. But, following a backlash from its users, OnlyFans suspended the policy change a week later. The site offers a platform for musicians, fitness trainers and celebrities to charge their followers for tips and visual content. But it is best known for allowing content creators including porn stars and sex workers to charge for sexually explicit photographs and videos. OnlyFans takes a 20% commission on all payments made to its content creators. The firm said Ms Gan had been appointed ""to continue the company's growth and drive its vision and commitment to empowering creators"". Ms Gan told Bloomberg the company would increase its investment in its free streaming app, OFTV, and introduce new tools for creators.

Lloyd Webber calls off Cinderella until February,"Lord Lloyd-Webber blamed the decision on ""this wretched virus"" Andrew Lloyd Webber has said he is ""devastated"" to have halted his latest musical Cinderella for seven weeks as Omicron plays havoc with live events. The West End show will return ""as soon as this wave is licked"", the composer and producer said, with a return currently scheduled for 9 February. It is the first major production to be put on ice for such an extended period. Cinderella is one of many plays to have already had UK performances cancelled because of Covid among cast and crew. It has been off the Gillian Lynne Theatre stage since Thursday. Carrie Hope Fletcher plays the title role in Cinderella ""Once again, this wretched virus has put paid to the joy of entertaining audiences, something that I hold so dear,""Lord Lloyd Webber wrote on Twitter,external. ""Sadly this is the right thing to do, not just for the safety of our cast, musicians and backstage crew, but for the quality of the show we give our audiences who travel long distances and make significant investments to come and see us. ""Rest assured, Cinderella will re-open as soon as this wave is licked and we know we can give our audiences the fantastic time they deserve."" The opening of the show was also disrupted earlier this year. A separate statement said,external: ""Like so many theatres up and down the country, day after day, we are forced to make decisions (often at short notice) based on the latest round of test results."" It added that producers were ""passionately committed to returning sooner if the circumstances improve and we will keep the situation under constant review"". Many theatres across the UK and US have been forced to cancel performances Over the weekend,half of London's major theatres were forced to cancelperformances because of outbreaks. Many more around the country have also suffered the same fate in recent days, including at the Liverpool Everyman and Playhouse, the Manchester Royal Exchange, the Lowry in Salford, the Wales Millennium Centre in Cardiff and Newcastle's Theatre Royal. Some have suspended shows until the New Year. Wendy and Peter Pan at the Leeds Playhouse and Shakespeare's Globe's Measure For Measure will not return until 4 January, while the curtain will stay down on the National Theatre's festive show Hex 5 until January.

On Broadway, the Alanis Morrissette musical Jagged Little Pill has closed for good, blaming ""the drastic turn of events this week with the rapid spread of the Omicron variant"". Lord Lloyd Webber's decision came despiteChancellor Rishi Sunak's announcementon Tuesday of an extra Â£30m for the Culture Recovery Fund to help English venues and arts organisations between now and March. The Theatres Trust said the funds must be ""distributed as quickly as possible to help protect theatres"". The charity's director Jon Morgan said: ""Theatres across the country are already struggling with shows being cancelled due to infections and falling ticket sales as audiences follow government advice to be cautious, so this support is very much needed."" The Society of London Theatre added: ""This is a clear signal that the chancellor and HM Treasury understand the challenges facing our theatres and other cultural businesses."" The Equity and Bectu unions called for more help for individual workers, who Equity said were ""staring into a winter of cancelled shows, bookings and performances"". Bectu added that the Culture Recovery Fund was ""focused on buildings not people, is too cumbersome and too slow"". Meanwhile, in Scotland,the government has orderedcapacities for seated indoor performances to be cut to 200 from from 26 December and a return of social distancing for at least three weeks. Those measures ""will have a devastating impact on theatres"", according to the Theatres Trust. ""We therefore welcome the additional financial support announced by the first minister and hope this will be distributed quickly,"" a statement said.

Fines for Wales employees not working from home,"Until now, it has been guidance for employees to work from home Fines will be handed out to employees in Wales who go to work when they could work from home. From Monday, workers will receive a Â£60 fixed penalty notice and companies hit with fines of Â£1,000 every time they break the rule. Until now therehas just been guidance encouraginghome working. The union GMB said it would affect ""the poorest, most vulnerable workers"" while the TUC said it was ""at best naÃ¯ve"" to think responsibility is shared. ""Additional measures have been introduced to limit the spread of the virus and protect public health,"" said a Welsh government spokesman. Should I be working from home now? Adapt for home working, boss says ""Further to our long-standing advice for people to work from home wherever possible, from Monday this will now be a legal requirement to work from home unless there is a reasonable excuse not to. ""We expect employers to take all reasonable steps to facilitate home working and provide employees with the support they need."" Many workers have been at home since the start of the pandemic in March 2020 The enforcement approach will include improvement or closure notices for premises, with a business owner liable to be fined Â£1,000 for not complying. This could rise to a maximum of Â£10,000, with individual employees liable to be hit with a Â£60 fine. Wales TUC general secretary Shavanah Taj expressed ""shock and concern"" at the decision. ""A worker is not responsible for their place of work, their employer is,"" she added. ""This sets a really worrying precedent that the responsibility is somehow shared, and is at best naive."" The GMB said it was concerned the poorest and most vulnerable workers would be hardest hit, with ""bad employers"" able to ""protect themselves from fines by placing liability on workers"". Senior organiser Kelly Andrews said: ""We think this strikes the wrong chord. ""We have major worries that this could lead to bad employers pressuring their workers to work from home without a paper trail and place any financial risk on them. ""Those workers are also the most vulnerable and can least afford to take the financial hit. ""But the truth is for a lot of families a Â£60 fine over Christmas will have a severe financial impact."" The Welsh Conservatives economy spokesman, Paul Davies MS, said the new rules had been brought in under the radar. ""This Labour administration seems to be getting rather comfortable governing by late night press releases and tinkering with the rules without letting the public know until they've already come into force,"" he said. Welsh Liberal Democrats called on the Welsh government to scrap the Â£60 fines for employees. Party leader Jane Dodds MS said: ""Employees should not be punished for potentially following the direction of a bad boss or employer who is not complying with instructions.""

Hogmanay events cancelled as Covid rules tightened,"This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon says Scotland's large-scale Hogmanay celebrations ""will not proceed"" Edinburgh's Hogmanay events have been cancelled and football matches will be effectively spectator-free as part of tough new Covid rules in Scotland. All outdoor events will be limited to just 500 people to help slow the spread of Omicron. Indoor events such as concerts will be limited to 200 people if they are seated, or 100 for standing. The new restrictions come into force on Boxing Day. They will be in place for three weeks - although there will be no limit to how many people can meet up at Christmas. The Old Firm derby between Celtic and Rangers on 2 January and the Edinburgh derby between Hearts and Hibs the following day are among the football fixtures that will be affected by the new rules. Crowds vastly reduced for Scottish sport What are the Covid rules in Scotland? Edinburgh cancellation 'incredibly sad' The government fears that last Sunday's League Cup Final in front of a capacity crowd at Hampden may have been a ""super spreader"" event, with Deputy First Minister John Swinney saying he regrets not making the decision to play matches without spectators sooner. Celtic have asked for the Scottish Premiership's three-week winter break - which is due to start after the Edinburgh derby on 3 January - to bebrought forwardto ""maximise the prospect of all supporters being able to attend matches and support the game they love."" All of the major Hogmanay events in Edinburgh - including the street party, the torchlit precession and the midnight firework display - have now been cancelled, as have many other events in towns and cities across the country. Edinburgh's annual torchlight procession, which takes place on 30 December, has also been cancelled Physical distancing of 1m will now need to be in place for all events that do go ahead under the restrictions. Pubs and other hospitality venues selling alcohol will need to reintroduce table service from 27 December. And indoor hospitality and leisure venues will be required to ensure there is a 1m distance between groups of people who are attending together - which could force nightclubs to close. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: ""This will of course make sports matches, including football, effectively spectator-free over this three week period. ""And it will also mean that large-scale Hogmanay celebrations - including that planned here in our capital city - will not proceed"". Wales had already announced plans for sporting events to beheld without crowdsfrom Boxing Day, and London hascancelled its New Year's Eve eventin Trafalgar Square. Many concerts, theatre productions and other events had already been cancelled voluntarily in Scotland. The Celtic-Rangers match on 2 January will be one of the fixtures affected by the new rules Omicron is now thought to account for 62.9% of all Covid cases in Scotland, with the first minister saying there was ""still no compelling evidence that Omicron is intrinsically milder than previous strains"". Ms Sturgeon said the much higher transmissibility of the new variant meant that large gatherings ""have the potential to become very rapid super-spreader events, putting large numbers at risk of getting infected very quickly"". She added: ""Limiting these events helps reduce the risk of widespread transmission. It also cuts down the transmission risks associated with travel to and from such events ""And these large events put an additional burden on emergency services, especially the police and ambulance services. ""At a time when these services are already under severe pressure and also dealing with high staff absences, limiting large scale events will help them focus on delivering essential services to the public."" Pubs will need to reintroduce table service from 27 December Ms Sturgeon stressed that the priority for the government was to ensure that schools re-open as normal after the Christmas holidays. And she again urged people to cut their contacts with people in other households as much as possible ahead of Christmas, and to stay at home as much as possible. The Federation of Small Business said the new measures would make trading ""drastically more difficult for huge numbers of small businesses in Scotland"". Its policy chair, Andrew McRae, said: ""The social distancing restrictions will mean shops and hospitality firms can serve fewer customers. ""And the changes to events, such as sports matches and Hogmanay celebrations, will have a knock-on impact on local economies."" The Scottish Licensed Traders Association said the restrictions would be a ""knockout blow""  to many businesses that were already struggling because of the pandemic. The Scottish government will now double the Â£100m it had already pledged to businesses hit by new Omicron restrictions. And Ms Sturgeon said recent announcements by the UK Treasury ""give us additional spending power now of Â£175m"" - bringing the total to Â£375m, all of which will be allocated to business support. While there are no changes to the rules and advice for Christmas gatherings, significant new restrictions will take effect as we head towards the new year. Edinburgh's Hogmanay is off for the second year in a row and big football matches can only be played before the smallest of crowds. The return of one metre distancing indoors will reduce the capacity of pubs and restaurants, theatres and cinemas - reducing their potential turnover too. There is fresh financial help worth Â£275m from the Scottish government which draws on additional funding announced by the UK Treasury at the weekend. Even though that's on top of an initial Â£100m earmarked by Holyrood ministers last week - it is unlikely to be nearly enough to offset the economic damage restrictions will cause. The first minister has renewed calls for the Chancellor to re-introduce a furlough scheme - something the Treasury has not included in the support package it announced today. Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said he understood the ""frustration and anger"" that many people would have over the new restrictions, but urged people to come forward for vaccination as the ""best way out of this"". He also called for household contacts of Covid cases to be allowed to end their self-isolation if they test negative, saying the current rules were well-intentioned but could ""grind our transport network, our economy and public services to a halt"". ScotRail cancelled more than 100 trains on Monday, largely because of crew members being affected by Covid. Ms Sturgeon said the government was ""actively considering"" changing household isolation rules once the booster campaign is complete, but said it would be ""counter-productive"" to do so while case numbers are rising. Meanwhile Scottish Labour's Anas Sarwar said there should be ""much more significant financial support"" for businesses and a ""furlough-type scheme"" for sectors which are effectively shut down.

Ministers 'decide against' Prestwick airport saleA second attempt to take Prestwick Airport back into the private sector has fallen through.Scotland politics,"The Scottish government has decided not to sell Prestwick Airport after rejecting a second bid to take it back into the private sector. The government bought the airport for Â£1 in 2013 when it was threatened with closure due to heavy losses. A preferred bidder was picked in February, but minsters have now decided against selling ""at this time"". Opposition parties said the government must demonstrate it has a plan for the airport and the public money invested. Finance Secretary Kate Forbes told MSPs that Prestwick was ""carving a niche"" as a specialist airport, noting that it was ""heavily involved"" in the COP26 conference in November. She said the business ""continues in a positive direction"" and had turned a profit in 2020-21. Preferred bidder chosen for Prestwick Airport The Scottish governmentbrought the airport into public ownership in 2013to protect jobs after its last owner - New Zealand firm Infratil - failed to find a buyer amid mounting losses. A bid to take the airport back into the private sector was lined up in 2019, but fell through the following year after the company involved pulled out. Another preferred bidder was announced in February 2021 after the government put the airport back on the market, but this deal also appears to have now collapsed. In a written answer at Holyrood, Ms Forbes said the airport had ""provided a professional and flexible service"" during the COP26 summit, and was providing ""essential services for the importation of cargo, including supplies for the NHS"". She said: ""Scottish ministers still intend for Prestwick airport to return to the private sector at the appropriate time and opportunity. ""Having carefully considered bids received under a recent sales process, I can advise that ministers have decided not to proceed with a sale at this time."" Scottish Labour said ""serious questions"" needed to be asked about the government's handling of the sale. Transport spokesman Colin Smyth said: ""Prestwick workers have been stuck in limbo for years waiting for this deal to materialise, only to get knocked back to square one and they deserve answers. ""The SNP must show they have a plan to for the future of this vital strategic asset, and the tens of millions of taxpayer pounds invested in it."" And Scottish Conservative MSP Graham Simpson added that ""the only thing flying out of Prestwick is taxpayers' money"". He said: ""Despite the small operating profit in the last year the government need to get Prestwick airport on the market, and off the books.""

"More Covid rules needed in Wales, minister says","More restrictions in Wales could be announced on Wednesday Wales will need more restrictions to keep the country safe, a senior Welsh government minister has said. Ministers will announce on Wednesday their plans for the post-Christmas period. Economy Minister Vaughan Gething said limits on household mixing were part of the Welsh government's discussions. It comes as spectators are banned from all indoor, outdoor, professional and community sports events in Wales from 26 December. Mr Gething said a Â£3m Spectator Sports Fund will be available to support clubs and venues. He said he expected ""several thousand"" identified Omicron cases in Wales by Boxing Day, with the real number being much higher. The number of Omicron cases identified in Wales rose by 204 on Tuesday to 640. Last week the Welsh government decided to shut nightclubs, and reintroduce social distancing in workplaces, from 27 December. Its cabinet met on Tuesday to discuss what happens next, including possible post-Christmas hospitality restrictions. Drakeford denies rules 'gambling' with livelihoods Nightclubs and restaurants fear New Year losses The Senedd will be recalled on Wednesday following a request from Welsh Conservative Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies. He said it was essential further changes were debated in the Senedd beforehand. ""The drip, drip effect of releasing restrictions by press release risks undermining public confidence at such an important time of the year for families and businesses,"" he said. ""Imposing restrictions on society must be done on the strongest possible evidence, and fully communicated to the Welsh public in the form we have become accustomed to during the pandemic - not released via press release at midnight."" The 2020 Welsh Grand National took place behind closed doors Plaid Cymru's sports spokeswoman Heledd Fychan said it was important sports clubs were supported. ""Our sports thrive with public support, and it's a cruel twist that so coronavirus thrives in crowds as well,"" she added. Out on the main shopping street in Treorchy, Rhondda Cynon Taf, there was a feeling of uncertainty about what's ahead. Rachel Evans, 50, said she was hoping her Boxing Day party with her two brothers and their families will still go ahead but she is prepared for the worst. ""It may have to be cancelled like it was last year. We did an online quiz then between us all. ""But we've seen a lot of footfall in Treorchy over the last few days, people worrying about what's going to happen. The shops are really busy at the minute."" Her daughter, Carys Evans, 19, has plans to go out with friends on New Year's Eve. ""Who knows now, I probably won't,"" she said. ""It's a bit gutting because especially last year when we couldn't go out. It's another year of it, another year of nothing really."" The former health minister Mr Gething said more protections ""are likely to be introduced from the 27th onwards"". He called for the UK government to return to furlough ""because I'm confident that more protective measures will be needed to keep people safe and alive and well"". Speaking to BBC Wales Today, Mr Gething said limits on household mixing will ""definitely need to be part of the discussion"" on any further restrictions. He admitted there were consequences from many restrictions but said: ""The danger is we wait and we wait and we wait before we act and by then when the evidence is crystal in terms of numbers and percentages it is too late to act."" The Cardiff v Scarlets Boxing Day match at Cardiff Arms Park was set to be a sell-out Events affected by the decision to shut sports to spectators include the Cardiff versus Scarlets rugby match at Cardiff Arms Park on 26 December, and the Welsh Grand National in Chepstow the following day. The move comes a few weeks ahead of big international fixtures, with the first of three Six Nations home games on 12 February against Scotland, while the men's football team play Austria in a crucial World Cup play-off in Cardiff on 24 March. Scarlets boss Phil Morgan said the news is ""another significant financial blow to the business"", but health and safety will ""always be our utmost priority"". TheOspreys versus Dragons matchhad already been called off because of a Covid outbreak, as had football matches involving Cardiff City and Newport County. The Welsh government said restrictions would be reviewed regularly, adding: ""Crowds will come back as soon as possible. We want everyone to be here to enjoy their favourite sports."" On these new restrictions, Mr Gething said: ""We need to do everything we can to protect people's health and control the spread of this awful virus."" The Welsh government said further details about the Â£3m support package would be made available following discussions with the sector. It added that a sporting event referred to all indoor and outdoor sporting events, whether ticketed or not, with spectators. It said this included larger sporting events and those at every level, including community level, which attract significantly smaller crowds. Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford has warned of further restrictions amid rising Omicron cases The overall rate of coronavirus infections is also rising in Wales, standing at 575 per 100,000 people. It has the lowest case rate of the nations. In hospitals, a total of 87.6% of acute hospital beds are occupied, slightly down on two weeks ago. The number of Covid patients on invasive ventilation or in critical care beds stands at 30, the lowest number seen since 23 August. There are more than four times the number of non-Covid patients in critical care. First Minister Mark Drakeford has warned of ""a gathering storm"" of Omicron infections after the Christmas period and has already announced that nightclubs will shut down at midnight on Boxing Day. He also said it was ""inevitable"" there would be further restrictions for pubs and restaurants after Christmas. The Welsh government said the new sports restrictions would be ""reviewed regularly"". Speaking toRadio Wales Breakfast, Prof Lawrence Young, a virologist at the University of Warwick, called for clarity on gatherings over Christmas, adding there were concerns over waiting while the virus continues to double every two days. ""The longer we leave it, the worse this is going to get. Waiting for more hospitalisations to increase before you make a move could be too little too late,"" he said. He added that the World Health Organization had advised ""it is better to cancel events than cancel lives"". ""We need to have more time to get jabs into arms. We know that the vaccine programme is going really well, but it's a very, very stretched target to get all adults boosted by the end of December."" Darren Hughes, director of the Welsh NHS Confederation, added it was not only the number of patients with Omicron that could put pressure on hospitals, but also the number of staff absences. ""It is starting to have a real serious impactâ¦ this isn't just down to government this is down to us as individuals to do all we can to protect ourselves and the family,"" he said.

"How Hasti, 7, and her family died in the English ChannelAt least 29 people lost their lives last month while crossing the Channel in a dinghy. We piece together the final hours of the their journey from France.","  In the freezing waters of the English Channel, a group of men, women and children are treading water and holding each other’s hands to stay afloat. Some are making desperate calls to rescuers on mobile phones held above the waves. But, as hypothermia sets in, their devices slip from their hands before they can send their location. The dinghy in which they had hoped to reach British shores has a broken motor and is deflating. One member of the group manages to send a voice message home. Just hours later, all but two of at least 30 people are dead - the worst migrant mass drowning in the Channel ever recorded. What went wrong? Here we piece together the final hours of the group - through survivors’ testimony, mobile phone messages, shipping data and the emergency response. As dusk falls, 22-year-old Hadiya Rzgar Hussein, her seven-year-old sister Hasti, brother Mubin, 16, and mum Kazhal, 46, gather their belongings together at the makeshift camp at Grande-Synthe, where they have been staying for several weeks.  They are tired and scared. French police recently dismantled the Grande-Synthe site, evicted its occupants and destroyed the family’s tent - and they are desperate to reach their relatives in the UK. To do this, they need to brave the so-called “death route” across the English Channel, paying people-smugglers to get them there on small, cheap inflatable boats. While the white cliffs of Dover are visible from some of this coastline on a clear day, the crossing is fraught with danger. It is one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes and those crossing must navigate freezing air and sea temperatures, and dangerous currents. The English Channel is one of the world’s busiest shipping routes At its shortest, it is just 21 miles (33km) across the Channel From the beaches near Dunkirk it is around 38 miles (61km) to the English coast Hadiya and her family have already tried to make it across three times before. Once they were turned back by police, once they ran out of fuel and on the third attempt the boat’s engine failed. But Hadiya’s dreams of becoming a doctor drive her and her family onwards. As evening draws in, the family are told by smugglers the time is right to leave and they join at least 28 others on board an arranged bus to Loon-Plage, a stretch of coastline between Dunkirk and Calais. The BBC has established 20 of these passengers were from Iraqi Kurdistan. The journey to the beach is short - just 10 minutes - and many on the bus begin to contact family back home to let them know they are about to leave France. Best friends Rezhwan Yasin Hassan, 19, Zanyar Mustafa Mina, 20 and Mohammed Qadir Aulla, 21, all from Iraqi Kurdistan, are among those messaging home from a shared phone.  A little later, another group of friends and acquaintances, who were also on the bus, contact their families in Iraq from several shared phones. The youngest are Pshtiwan Rasul Farka and Twana Mamand Mohammed, both 18, and 19-year-old Mohammed Hussein Mohammed. Also travelling with them are “Hybar” Bryar Hamad Abdulrahman, 23, Afrasia Ahmed Mohammed, 27, “Harem” Serkaut Perot Muhammad, 28, Shakar Ali Pirot, 30, and Hassan Mohammed Ali, 37. Among them is one Iranian, Sirwan Alipour, 23.  Bryar (pictured above, top-right) calls his mum and says he will contact her “when on the other side of the Channel”. Hadiya, the 22-year-old hoping to train as a doctor, texts her father - the man who made this trip possible. He sold the family home and borrowed money to raise the $42,000 (£32,000) needed. Iraqi Kurd “Baran” Maryam Nuri Mohamed Amin 24, trying to reach her fiance in the UK, and her friend, 32-year-old Mhabad Ahmad Ali, are also getting on the boat.  To go ahead with the launch, conditions need to be right – no police patrols, clear skies and a calm sea. At about 22:00 French time, traffickers give the migrants the final green light to cross. Some rescuers call such times “migrant weather” because it is when many decide to make the journey. But they warn it is not the wind that is the biggest challenge. It is the freezing air and sea temperatures.  A number of dinghies are dug up from their hiding places along the dunes, where they have been kept out of view of the police. At least six boats are launching that night. Hadiya and her family along with everyone else on the bus are allocated a 10m- (33-ft-) long, rubber inflatable dinghy with a motor attached at the rear. A boat like this can be bought second-hand for £400 ($531). It has no solid base and isn’t designed to safely carry more than 20 people. But this small dinghy leaves France with a human cargo of at least 32 adults and children on board. The boat pushes out into the open waters and Pshtiwan sends his last voice message home - the dinghy motor heard in the background. Overloaded, the boat makes slow progress - partly because of its excess weight - as it heads north-west into the night. Its passengers cling on to each other, and to the sides of the vessel, as the waves increase in size. Another group of migrants making the same journey just an hour later describe “big waves and stormy weather”. They are left soaking wet and freezing cold. Some are also seasick, and they end up aborting their journey and returning to France. Hadiya and her group begin to run into difficulties. As the boat reaches the middle of the Channel, its right side begins to deflate and the vessel starts taking on water. Baran messages her fiance in the UK, Karzan, on Snapchat. She describes how the boat is losing air and is taking on water, but jokes and tries to reassure him things will be fine. Those steering the boat are trying hard to keep it afloat, she says, and she is sure that the authorities will rescue them soon. Passengers begin to debate flagging down a ship they have spotted in the distance, but the consensus is they should push on to Britain. But worse is to come. A short time later, the boat’s engine cuts out, leaving the vessel and its passengers at the mercy of the Channel’s currents. The boat begins to be swallowed by the waves. As they are plunged into the freezing water, the group cling together and to what’s left of the deflated dinghy, to stop themselves drifting away from each other. They have travelled at least 30km (19 miles) from the beach where they first departed. BBC analysis of the current and ship tracking data suggests they are now near the maritime line that marks the start of British territorial waters. As they hold each other’s hands, those who can, including 16-year-old Mubin - Hadiya’s little brother - phone both the French and English authorities for help. Mid-conversation with her fiance, Baran drops off Snapchat. At least two of the group get through to the British authorities on the phone, who ask for the group’s location and tell them to keep their mobile torches on. But those passengers’ phones fall into the water before they can send the details, survivors say. Around this time, Shakar Ali Pirot sends a voice message to his family. He says if he is saved he will toss his phone into the waves - something many migrants have told the BBC they are ordered to do by smugglers to protect the people-traffickers’ identities. Some also say they do it to hide details that may prevent their asylum claims being accepted once on UK soil. Shakar’s voice message is believed to be the last known communication from the boat. According to the WhatsApp exchange between Shakar and his family, seen by the BBC, his phone stays online until 04:14 French time, but he sends no more messages. The boat is now completely submerged and all the passengers are treading water. Hypothermia sets in. He is a strong swimmer and he makes for a nearby vessel. A second migrant boat - which set off after the one carrying Hadiya and her family - arrives in the middle of the Channel. In the early morning light they see bodies in the water. The passengers of that boat call the French authorities for help. This second dinghy later arrives safely in the UK. Nearly 12 hours have passed since Hadiya and her group fell into the water. Then just before 14:00, 37-year-old French fisherman Karl Maquinghen and his crew, on board their trawler Saint Jacques II, spot 15 bodies in the water. Karl says many of the victims wearing life jackets had not connected the crotch strap correctly, which would have made it harder for them to keep their heads above water. Karl and his crew quickly raise the alarm and the nearby French navy vessel, FS Flamant - about 5km (3 miles) away - responds. The FS Flamant arrives at the scene, just inside French territorial waters A British coastguard helicopter joins the search and spots debris in the water, a few kilometres to the north-east The focus of the search shifts and by 15:45 two French coastguard vessels arrive at the new location The deflated dinghy, the rest of the dead and the two survivors are found 6km (4 miles) from where the first bodies are seen A total of 27 bodies are recovered, including those of seven women, two teenagers and one young girl. The two survivors claim the dinghy had crossed over into British waters. They say they continued to make desperate calls to both the British and French authorities, but were told by both sides to call the other. It is broadly accepted that a country has responsibility for maritime rescues in its territorial waters, although anyone finding a vessel in distress is expected to help with a rescue.  The French maritime authorities (the Maritime Prefecture of the Channel and the North Sea) say they were “not aware this boat was in difficulty prior to the alert raised by a fishing vessel”, referencing the Saint Jacques II. They add that on that same night, 106 people were saved during three different operations. However, according to the French newspaper Le Monde, a source inside the official police investigation has revealed that the itemised phone bills of the survivors confirm claims they called the French authorities for help. The UK Home Office maintains the boat was never in British territory and has rejected any claims they failed to respond to the sunken vessel. Analysis exclusive to the BBC suggests the migrant boat came close to, but never entered UK waters. Weather and water-current data from that location throughout the day suggests the boat would certainly have been pushed around, but we can deduce from the location the migrants were found in, and the direction of the currents, that waves would not have pushed them back from British waters. The BBC has confirmed at least 30 people died that night - by far the worst migrant tragedy ever recorded in the Channel. We have established, through help from many families in Iraqi Kurdistan, the identities of 20 of those on board. This includes Hadiya and her family, including her seven-year-old little sister Hasti.  There is also Baran and her friend Mhabad; best friends, Rezhwan and Mohammed Qadir, and young men Afrasia, Bilind, Bryar, Harem, Hassan, Mohammed Hussein, Muslim, Shakar and Sirwan. The body of Zanyar - Rezhwan and Mohammed’s best friend - has not yet been recovered. Pshtiwan and Twana are also still missing.   All of them were economic migrants and nearly all of them had previously tried - and failed - to get to Britain via legal routes multiple times. They had all also attempted to cross the Channel at least three, and in some cases six, times before in small boats. The French authorities told the BBC 10 other passengers who died have been identified as three Ethiopians, a woman from Somalia, four men from Afghanistan, a man from Egypt and one person from Vietnam. For Rzgar Hussein Mohammed, the pain of losing his wife and three children to the waters that night is too much to bear.  A month on, despite freezing temperatures, hundreds of migrants have continued to cross the Channel each week. Evicted from their makeshift camps by the French police in Calais, many say they have little choice but to take their chances with the Channel’s waves.

Turkey farms want end to Christmas staff shortage,"Kate and David Postance say there's a shortage of staff, not turkeys Turkey farms and poultry processors say a long-term fix is needed to workforce shortages which could have threatened people's Christmas dinners. Many rely on non-UK staff but availability has been hit by Brexit and the pandemic. Getting college students involved could be part of the answer, according to one Welsh farm managing to recruit locally. The UK government said it wanted employers to make long-term investments in the domestic workforce. At Postance Poultry near Cardigan, Ceredigion, orders for Christmas turkeys started flooding in ""much earlier than usual"", according to owner Kate Postance. Soon they were completely sold out, which she puts down to media reports earlier this year raising fears about availability. ""The truth is there were always enough turkeys, it's just staffing that was an issue,"" she explained. In October - under pressure from the industry - the UK government made changes to its pilot scheme offering temporary visas to agricultural workers from overseas to include 5,500 seasonal poultry staff. However, ministers would prefer to see jobs taken up by people living in the area, something Ms Postance is managing to achieve. Retailers warn of Christmas turkey shortage fears What will happen to all that leftover turkey? Food firms call on government to fix supply chain ""I think a lot of it is that we're willing for anybody to come and give it a go - our eldest member is in his 60s and the youngest is 14,"" she said. ""The days that we do are long and they're tiring - but we sing songs together and listen to the radio."" ""It's actually the sort of job that can be quite enjoyable once you've got the right team around you."" She thinks school pupils and college students should be encouraged to visit farms and processing sites to try and attract them into the industry. ""Education is the key and getting young people out onto these farms to say look this is the process,"" she said. Lord Newborough says the abattoir he uses usually has 19 seasonal Christmas workers, but this year it had just one But with a team of 11 preparing around 300 turkeys in time for Christmas, she emphasised that her business is ""very small"" in comparison to the major processors who've faced ""a really challenging two years"" due to the fallout from Brexit and Covid. ""I think we've got a very difficult situation on our hands,"" acknowledges Lord Newborough, who owns the Rhug Estate organic farm near Corwen, Denbighshire. Many of its turkeys, geese and chickens are destined for the kitchens of high-end hotels and restaurants in London and Hong Kong. But in September, the farm was warned by the abattoir it uses in Cheshire that staffing issues meant it might not be able to process the birds in time. ""Normally at that time of year they would be employing 19 people who come back each year from eastern Europe, but this year they only had one,"" Lord Newborough explained. ""Eventually he managed with a lower workforce working much longer hours to get our turkeys and geese processed so we're a week to Christmas and things are ok."" But the situation has led to questions over whether the farm will continue to rear turkeys. Decisions over whether to buy in chicks need to be taken early in the new year. ""The problem has not gone away and it needs resolving fairly soon if we're to have any confidence to produce birds next year,"" Lord Newborough said. The UK needs ""a long term strategy"" for seasonal agricultural work, he urged adding that if the problems continued it would ""add up to the perfect storm of inflation and higher prices"". ""We need people to come in from Europe - we've got voids to fill - anyone who thinks otherwise is not seeing the problem as we see it on the ground."" Lord Newborough says the UK needs a ""long-term strategy"" for seasonal agricultural work Figures from the British Poultry Council (BPC), which represents producers of half the meat eaten in the UK suggests that more than 2600 people work in the sector in Wales. It's an industry that's expanding here - as traditional sheep and cattle farms look to diversify. ""Technology, a focus on skills and education and a non-UK workforce"" would help ""to avoid jeopardising our ability to feed the nation,"" said BPC chairman Richard Griffiths. He wants a new scheme to be introduced by the spring of next year to allow foreign labour to enter the UK over a period of two years. That would give ""space and time to upskill a British workforce and invest in new technologies"" - including automation. The processing sector had tried to put training schemes in place as well as ""promoting (itself) as a long-term viable career for young people,"" added John Richards, industry development manager for Meat Promotion Wales. ""But all this takes time.  We need a wider supply chain strategy to ensure people come into the sector and remain as important individuals working towards ensuring that consumers can continue to get the high quality produce from Wales that they currently receive."" The Rhug Estate is deciding whether or not rear turkeys in the long-term A Welsh government spokesman said visas for the poultry industry ""are only a short term solution, and will not address the long-term issues the sector is facing"". ""We have written to the UK government on multiple occasions and asked they consider introducing a 12 month Covid recovery visa,"" he said. Skills development and training for the sector was being supported through the government's Food Skills Cymru programme, he added. A spokeswoman for the UK government said that poultry butchers, processors and dressers were ""all eligible for the skilled worker visa route under the points based (immigration) system"" since December last year. ""These workers can be sponsored for up to 5 years and there is no cap on numbers,"" she said. ""But we also want employers to make long term investments in the UK domestic workforce, and our Plan for Jobs is helping people across the country retrain, build new skills and get back into work.""

The paramedics keeping patients out of hospital,"This video can not be played Patients being moved away from emergency departments Chest pains for a 63-year-old man might typically mean a hospital trip to check it out. But after Clive Pietzka's 999 call, an advanced paramedic practitioner carried out tests and discharged him. The Welsh Ambulance Service Trust (WAST) job is one of those in a growing team who work to keep people out of hospital. Solutions like this are being sought following ambulance queues for hospital and worst ever performance figures. Covid patient waited 40 hours in Cardiff hospital A&E What does Omicron mean for Christmas in Wales? When can I get my booster and how do I book? Mr Pietzka, from Barry, who has a heart problem, said initially he did not want to call an ambulance because of high demand. ""They're very busy with Covid and everything else. But the GP practice said to call 999,"" he said. Clive Pietzka said he was ""over the moon"" with being tested and discharged from home However, on this occasion a rapid response vehicle - a car with a single paramedic - came within 15-20 minutes and tests were performed, without a hospital trip. ""I'm over the moon,"" Mr Pietzka said. Advanced paramedic practitioner John McAllister who attended said he sees people more medical low acuity cases rather than emergency and trauma conditions. Having served as a paramedic since 2009, he more recently studied for a masters qualification, paid for by his employer, with three days a week in university and two days with a GP practice. John McAllister says his job is about treating people at ""the right time and place"" without going to A&E ""I use assessment techniques and diagnostic tools to assess patients, formulate a diagnosis then put a plan in place,"" he said. ""It's about trying to treat them at the right time and the right place, without having to take them to A&E."" Mr McAllister explained that Mr Pietzka's case was quite common. ""We worry about anyone with chest pains. ""But this job is ideal for me and is where advanced practice comes into its own, because as a paramedic I would have been quite reluctant to have discharged Clive."" But he explained a thorough assessment and appropriate tests reassured them both. ""He's happy he's home and it's another ambulance saved and another bed not being taken up in an emergency department."" Figures in November show WAST responded to just half of immediately life-threatening calls within eight minutes Fears of Christmas spike in emergency worker attacks Ambulances parked up to care for hospital patients Last month's official figures showed the worst ever performance - again - for emergency departments and the ambulance service in Wales. November's figures showed theambulance service responded to just half of immediately life-threatening calls within eight minutes. Adding to the pressure of the pandemic and winter demand, a shortage of social care workers to support patients' safe discharge means a large number of patients find themselves in hospital longer than medically necessary. The knock-on impact means it is becoming harder for new patients to be treated and admitted. Penny Durrant, the service manager for the clinical support desk at WAST regional headquarters in Cwmbran, said current challenges had led to growth in her team. She said it was a ""recognition of needing to do something different"". The military has been assisting the ambulance service across the UK Her team is based in the control room, where calls come in and is made up of clinicians, paramedics, nurses and midwives. They contact people often waiting a number of hours for an ambulance to see if there's a quicker, safe alternative. In many cases, a trip to A&E simply isn't right for them. ""There's a lot of callers that just need guidance, rather than assistance,"" Ms Durrant said. ""It's a really challenging situation, but we need to make sure that the resources we have are used for the sickest patients."" Matthew Watkins, who was one of the paramedics working on the clinical support desk, explained how his call to a pregnant woman with Covid led to a different transport decision. She'd phoned 999 as she was experiencing breathing difficulties. On this occasion, Mr Watkins said she would need a trip to hospital, but he explained to her and her partner they may prefer to make their own way in. ""She's only a 10 minute car ride to the hospital, but it would be three to six hours for an ambulance,"" he said. ""Fortunately the family were able to assist. People need to be aware, if you've got access to your own transport, we'd much rather you be seen in a hospital environment than sat at home waiting for an ambulance."" Clinical support desk clinicians like Nathan Maloney may be able to do four calls an hour Meanwhile, Nathan Maloney, a nurse on the clinical support desk alongside occasional shifts in A&E, said about 30% of the calls he dealt with resulted in people not needing hospital. ""We try and direct people to the most appropriate care, whether that's back to the GP, a district nurse, or acute mental health services,"" he said. But he acknowledged that frustrations with overwhelmed services elsewhere caused people to call 999. ""People will tell us they're calling because they can't get through to their GP, which is not a clinical reason to phone 999. But GPs are seeing people and are working very hard. ""There's a lot of anxiety and people who have tested positive phone us for advice. It's important to get advice, but 999 is for life threatening services only."" It's an area the service is heavily investing in and while it isn't a face-to-face role, managers hope elements will appeal to those paramedics often waiting hours outside A&E. ""You can be doing one or two calls a day whilst you're out on the road,"" said Ms Durrant. ""Whereas the clinical support desk clinicians may be able to do four calls an hour.""

"Lloyd Webber calls off Cinderella until FebruaryThe West End musical will return ""as soon as this wave is licked"", the composer and producer says.Entertainment & Arts","Lord Lloyd-Webber blamed the decision on ""this wretched virus"" Andrew Lloyd Webber has said he is ""devastated"" to have halted his latest musical Cinderella for seven weeks as Omicron plays havoc with live events. The West End show will return ""as soon as this wave is licked"", the composer and producer said, with a return currently scheduled for 9 February. It is the first major production to be put on ice for such an extended period. Cinderella is one of many plays to have already had UK performances cancelled because of Covid among cast and crew. It has been off the Gillian Lynne Theatre stage since Thursday. Carrie Hope Fletcher plays the title role in Cinderella ""Once again, this wretched virus has put paid to the joy of entertaining audiences, something that I hold so dear,""Lord Lloyd Webber wrote on Twitter,external. ""Sadly this is the right thing to do, not just for the safety of our cast, musicians and backstage crew, but for the quality of the show we give our audiences who travel long distances and make significant investments to come and see us. ""Rest assured, Cinderella will re-open as soon as this wave is licked and we know we can give our audiences the fantastic time they deserve."" The opening of the show was also disrupted earlier this year. A separate statement said,external: ""Like so many theatres up and down the country, day after day, we are forced to make decisions (often at short notice) based on the latest round of test results."" It added that producers were ""passionately committed to returning sooner if the circumstances improve and we will keep the situation under constant review"". Many theatres across the UK and US have been forced to cancel performances Over the weekend,half of London's major theatres were forced to cancelperformances because of outbreaks. Many more around the country have also suffered the same fate in recent days, including at the Liverpool Everyman and Playhouse, the Manchester Royal Exchange, the Lowry in Salford, the Wales Millennium Centre in Cardiff and Newcastle's Theatre Royal. Some have suspended shows until the New Year. Wendy and Peter Pan at the Leeds Playhouse and Shakespeare's Globe's Measure For Measure will not return until 4 January, while the curtain will stay down on the National Theatre's festive show Hex 5 until January.

On Broadway, the Alanis Morrissette musical Jagged Little Pill has closed for good, blaming ""the drastic turn of events this week with the rapid spread of the Omicron variant"". Lord Lloyd Webber's decision came despiteChancellor Rishi Sunak's announcementon Tuesday of an extra Â£30m for the Culture Recovery Fund to help English venues and arts organisations between now and March. The Theatres Trust said the funds must be ""distributed as quickly as possible to help protect theatres"". The charity's director Jon Morgan said: ""Theatres across the country are already struggling with shows being cancelled due to infections and falling ticket sales as audiences follow government advice to be cautious, so this support is very much needed."" The Society of London Theatre added: ""This is a clear signal that the chancellor and HM Treasury understand the challenges facing our theatres and other cultural businesses."" The Equity and Bectu unions called for more help for individual workers, who Equity said were ""staring into a winter of cancelled shows, bookings and performances"". Bectu added that the Culture Recovery Fund was ""focused on buildings not people, is too cumbersome and too slow"". Meanwhile, in Scotland,the government has orderedcapacities for seated indoor performances to be cut to 200 from from 26 December and a return of social distancing for at least three weeks. Those measures ""will have a devastating impact on theatres"", according to the Theatres Trust.

Sex and the City stars give support to Chris Noth accusers,"Chris Noth most recently starred in the Sex And The City sequel, And Just Like That... with Sarah Jessica Parker The leading actresses of the Sex And The City TV show have expressed support for two women who have accused their co-star Chris Noth of sexual assault. Sarah Jessica Parker, Cynthia Nixon and Kristin Davis said they were ""deeply saddened"" to hear of the allegations. ""We support the women who have come forward and shared their painful experiences,"" they said in a joint statement. Mr Noth, 67, has rejected the accusations as ""categorically false"". The actor, who played the character of Mr Big in the hugely popular series - the main love interest for Sarah Jessica Parker's protagonist - has said the encounters with both women were consensual. However he has been dropped from several contracts since the allegations were made in The Hollywood Reporter magazine last week. Four days on from the initial reports, US networks CBS and Universal Television confirmed that Mr Noth had been sacked from his current show, The Equaliser. Fitness brand Peloton removed an advert featuring him from its social media pages last week. The statement, issued on all three actresses' social media pages, comes just a fortnight after a sequel to Sex And The City was released, entitled And Just Like That... in which Mr Noth reprised his role as Mr Big.

The women who have accused Mr Noth of sexual assaulttold The Hollywood Reporter,externalthat seeing him on the new show had prompted them to come forward. They gave detailed accounts of the alleged assaults to the magazine, under the pseudonyms Zoe and Lily. Zoe, now 40, says she was 22 years old when the actor allegedly raped her at an apartment in West Hollywood in 2004. Lily, now 31, says she was raped in his Greenwich Village apartment in New York City in 2015 when she was 25 and he was 60. The detailed article by journalist Kim Masters also interviews people such as Zoe's boss at the time, a rape treatment centre and a friend of Lily's whose accounts all seem to back up both women's claims. The article also quotes text messages purportedly between Mr Noth and Lily at the time of the alleged assault. Mr Noth has said in a statement to US outlets: ""The accusations against me made by individuals I met years, even decades, ago are categorically false. ""These stories could've been from 30 years ago or 30 days ago - no always means no - that is a line I did not cross. The encounters were consensual."" ""It's difficult not to question the timing of these stories coming out. I don't know for certain why they are surfacing now, but I do know this: I did not assault these women."" Los Angeles Police has said the allegations have not led to an investigation because no official report has been made to police.

Hospitality businesses like pubs and restaurants will be able to apply for cash grants of up to Â£6,000 per premises.

Mr McFadden said the support was ""welcome"" but that it should have been announced last week when MPs voted to pass the government's Plan B measures. In the past, government support has been extended when government policy has restricted businesses ability to trade - so this is an important recognition that consumer caution can be almost as damaging as mandatory closure. The question then is - is this it? The chancellor said that the government has always responded when necessary but he was also at pains to point out that this level of grant funding was similar in generosity to those given during lockdown. A hint perhaps that this is as good as it gets - for grant funding at least.

But Michael Kill, chief executive of the Night Time Industries Association, said ""mixed"" government messaging and further restrictions had had a ""catastrophic impact"" on nightclubs and other late-night venues over the past two weeks. He described the chancellor's support package as ""far too little"" and said it bordered ""on the insulting"" in the face of failing businesses, lost livelihoods, and a ""crippled"" industry. A pub owner from Stoke-on-Trent has said he expects to receive just under Â£2,700 in support, rather than the headline Â£6,000 - as the system is based on business rates, so larger chains will be the ones to benefit from the top end of support. Rob Ledgar told BBC Radio 4's PM programme he was around 40 to 60% down on his normal festive turnover and the funding only represents ""about seven to 10 days worth of trade over Christmas"". Meanwhile, other business owners have urged the government to provide certainty about the Covid situation, rather than handouts. Nathan Godley, from restaurant supply firm Premier Seafoods in Grimsby, Lincolnshire, said that while he did not qualify for or want government support, he wanted certainty so he could plan orders in advance and avoid losing money or stock.

"Hogmanay events cancelled as Covid rules tightened in ScotlandOutdoor events including football matches will be limited to 500 people, and indoor to a maximum of 200.Scotland politics","This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon says Scotland's large-scale Hogmanay celebrations ""will not proceed"" Edinburgh's Hogmanay events have been cancelled and football matches will be effectively spectator-free as part of tough new Covid rules in Scotland. All outdoor events will be limited to just 500 people to help slow the spread of Omicron. Indoor events such as concerts will be limited to 200 people if they are seated, or 100 for standing. The new restrictions come into force on Boxing Day. They will be in place for three weeks - although there will be no limit to how many people can meet up at Christmas. The Old Firm derby between Celtic and Rangers on 2 January and the Edinburgh derby between Hearts and Hibs the following day are among the football fixtures that will be affected by the new rules. Crowds vastly reduced for Scottish sport What are the Covid rules in Scotland? Edinburgh cancellation 'incredibly sad' The government fears that last Sunday's League Cup Final in front of a capacity crowd at Hampden may have been a ""super spreader"" event, with Deputy First Minister John Swinney saying he regrets not making the decision to play matches without spectators sooner. Celtic have asked for the Scottish Premiership's three-week winter break - which is due to start after the Edinburgh derby on 3 January - to bebrought forwardto ""maximise the prospect of all supporters being able to attend matches and support the game they love."" All of the major Hogmanay events in Edinburgh - including the street party, the torchlit precession and the midnight firework display - have now been cancelled, as have many other events in towns and cities across the country. Edinburgh's annual torchlight procession, which takes place on 30 December, has also been cancelled Physical distancing of 1m will now need to be in place for all events that do go ahead under the restrictions. Pubs and other hospitality venues selling alcohol will need to reintroduce table service from 27 December. And indoor hospitality and leisure venues will be required to ensure there is a 1m distance between groups of people who are attending together - which could force nightclubs to close. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: ""This will of course make sports matches, including football, effectively spectator-free over this three week period. ""And it will also mean that large-scale Hogmanay celebrations - including that planned here in our capital city - will not proceed"". Wales had already announced plans for sporting events to beheld without crowdsfrom Boxing Day, and London hascancelled its New Year's Eve eventin Trafalgar Square. Many concerts, theatre productions and other events had already been cancelled voluntarily in Scotland. The Celtic-Rangers match on 2 January will be one of the fixtures affected by the new rules Omicron is now thought to account for 62.9% of all Covid cases in Scotland, with the first minister saying there was ""still no compelling evidence that Omicron is intrinsically milder than previous strains"". Ms Sturgeon said the much higher transmissibility of the new variant meant that large gatherings ""have the potential to become very rapid super-spreader events, putting large numbers at risk of getting infected very quickly"". She added: ""Limiting these events helps reduce the risk of widespread transmission. It also cuts down the transmission risks associated with travel to and from such events ""And these large events put an additional burden on emergency services, especially the police and ambulance services. ""At a time when these services are already under severe pressure and also dealing with high staff absences, limiting large scale events will help them focus on delivering essential services to the public."" Pubs will need to reintroduce table service from 27 December Ms Sturgeon stressed that the priority for the government was to ensure that schools re-open as normal after the Christmas holidays. And she again urged people to cut their contacts with people in other households as much as possible ahead of Christmas, and to stay at home as much as possible. The Federation of Small Business said the new measures would make trading ""drastically more difficult for huge numbers of small businesses in Scotland"". Its policy chair, Andrew McRae, said: ""The social distancing restrictions will mean shops and hospitality firms can serve fewer customers. ""And the changes to events, such as sports matches and Hogmanay celebrations, will have a knock-on impact on local economies."" The Scottish Licensed Traders Association said the restrictions would be a ""knockout blow""  to many businesses that were already struggling because of the pandemic. The Scottish government will now double the Â£100m it had already pledged to businesses hit by new Omicron restrictions. And Ms Sturgeon said recent announcements by the UK Treasury ""give us additional spending power now of Â£175m"" - bringing the total to Â£375m, all of which will be allocated to business support. While there are no changes to the rules and advice for Christmas gatherings, significant new restrictions will take effect as we head towards the new year. Edinburgh's Hogmanay is off for the second year in a row and big football matches can only be played before the smallest of crowds. The return of one metre distancing indoors will reduce the capacity of pubs and restaurants, theatres and cinemas - reducing their potential turnover too. There is fresh financial help worth Â£275m from the Scottish government which draws on additional funding announced by the UK Treasury at the weekend. Even though that's on top of an initial Â£100m earmarked by Holyrood ministers last week - it is unlikely to be nearly enough to offset the economic damage restrictions will cause. The first minister has renewed calls for the Chancellor to re-introduce a furlough scheme - something the Treasury has not included in the support package it announced today. Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said he understood the ""frustration and anger"" that many people would have over the new restrictions, but urged people to come forward for vaccination as the ""best way out of this"". He also called for household contacts of Covid cases to be allowed to end their self-isolation if they test negative, saying the current rules were well-intentioned but could ""grind our transport network, our economy and public services to a halt"". ScotRail cancelled more than 100 trains on Monday, largely because of crew members being affected by Covid. Ms Sturgeon said the government was ""actively considering"" changing household isolation rules once the booster campaign is complete, but said it would be ""counter-productive"" to do so while case numbers are rising. Meanwhile Scottish Labour's Anas Sarwar said there should be ""much more significant financial support"" for businesses and a ""furlough-type scheme"" for sectors which are effectively shut down.

Month delay before incorrect Covid tests haltedCourt papers show discrepancies at Immensa's laboratory were flagged as early as mid September.Somerset,"Testing at the Immensa Health Clinic in Wolverhampton was suspended after the errors were discovered Discrepancies in Covid test results were spotted a month before testing was halted at one lab, court papers show. More than 43,000 people received incorrect results aftererrors at the Immensa laboratory in Wolverhampton. Many ofthose affected live in the south west of England. Documents show the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) was alerted to the unusual figures on 14 September. Tests at the lab were suspended on 12 October and an investigation is ongoing. The UKHSA said it ""cannot comment on any information that could form part of these investigations before they are complete"". It said: ""We suspended testing at the Immensa Wolverhampton laboratory following an ongoing investigation into positive LFD (lateral flow) results subsequently testing negative on PCR. ""Those affected were contacted as soon as possible."" Immensa said it was fully cooperating with the investigation. It's hard to realise what the Immensa problems mean without putting a human face on it. Although thousands of people affected had been contacted by the UKHSA, there are also many families who have not. People like Amber Marshall from Stonehouse in Gloucestershire, whose 84-year-old grandmother Pam Bembenek died in October after being infected by a care home worker who had wrongly been given the all clear. So ripples of this serious incident may extend far beyond what we already have been told. Concerns were raised when people with positive lateral flow test results received negative follow-up PCR results between 8 September and 12 October. It is estimated thatabout 43,000 people may have been given incorrect results. The errors led to people infected with Covid being mistakenly advised to stop isolating, increasing the risk of potentially infecting others. The court documents showed Immensa was only required to routinely report tests that had produced no result, along with information about how fast the laboratory was turning tests around. There were no checks to see how results compared with other laboratories - something that has since changed. Andrew Preston, a microbiologist from the University of Bath, said: ""This is an issue that should have been flagged very soon after it started to arise, and then there should be procedures in place to at least know what's going on - and say 'hold on a minute' and say 'we need to go in'. ""And then in that case, if you have doubts over the veracity of your testing programme you cannot continue to test live samples if you are not convinced by the results."" Campaign group The Good Law Project, which has launched a judicial review over the government's handling of the issue, said many of the laboratory's discrepancies had been discovered through social media. It said: ""When did we become reliant upon citizens to check that box fresh companies, unaccredited with Â£120m of public contracts, are delivering?""

Ministers 'decide against' Prestwick airport sale,"The Scottish government has decided not to sell Prestwick Airport after rejecting a second bid to take it back into the private sector. The government bought the airport for Â£1 in 2013 when it was threatened with closure due to heavy losses. A preferred bidder was picked in February, but minsters have now decided against selling ""at this time"". Opposition parties said the government must demonstrate it has a plan for the airport and the public money invested. Finance Secretary Kate Forbes told MSPs that Prestwick was ""carving a niche"" as a specialist airport, noting that it was ""heavily involved"" in the COP26 conference in November. She said the business ""continues in a positive direction"" and had turned a profit in 2020-21. Preferred bidder chosen for Prestwick Airport The Scottish governmentbrought the airport into public ownership in 2013to protect jobs after its last owner - New Zealand firm Infratil - failed to find a buyer amid mounting losses. A bid to take the airport back into the private sector was lined up in 2019, but fell through the following year after the company involved pulled out. Another preferred bidder was announced in February 2021 after the government put the airport back on the market, but this deal also appears to have now collapsed. In a written answer at Holyrood, Ms Forbes said the airport had ""provided a professional and flexible service"" during the COP26 summit, and was providing ""essential services for the importation of cargo, including supplies for the NHS"". She said: ""Scottish ministers still intend for Prestwick airport to return to the private sector at the appropriate time and opportunity. ""Having carefully considered bids received under a recent sales process, I can advise that ministers have decided not to proceed with a sale at this time."" Scottish Labour said ""serious questions"" needed to be asked about the government's handling of the sale. Transport spokesman Colin Smyth said: ""Prestwick workers have been stuck in limbo for years waiting for this deal to materialise, only to get knocked back to square one and they deserve answers. ""The SNP must show they have a plan to for the future of this vital strategic asset, and the tens of millions of taxpayer pounds invested in it."" And Scottish Conservative MSP Graham Simpson added that ""the only thing flying out of Prestwick is taxpayers' money"". He said: ""Despite the small operating profit in the last year the government need to get Prestwick airport on the market, and off the books.""

Thanks for joining us and please stay safe.  Business leaders are calling for fast movement on getting cash to the businesses that need it. Andrew McRae from The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) Scotland, said that the measures announced would make trading ""drastically more difficult"" for huge numbers of small businesses. He said: ""After a
disappointing festive trading period, these moves will heap pressure on local
firms and the self-employed. ""The same group of businesses that took the
greatest hit earlier in the crisis now face another gruelling winter and
spring. ""These operators now face tough decisions about whether they open their
doors with restrictions in place or stop trading until theyâre lifted.""  For the second year running Edinburgh's famous celebrations will be muted as a result of Covid Edinburgh City Council leader Adam McVey acknowledges how disappointing it will be for young people to have their New Year plans ended. But he says that their priority must always be to protect the health and
wellbeing of the public, staff and the city. Given the spread of this variant, reflected in the rising infection numbers, we need to avoid any additional burden on our health and emergency services. Iâm grateful to the Scottish Government, Public Health, NHS and Police for their engagement with our teams to keep the City as safe as possible as we grapple with these challenges through the festive period. I would encourage everyone to continue following the guidance and to please celebrate Hogmanay safely and responsibly. Adam McVey, Leader, Edinburgh City Council Question from Nina in Glasgow There are currently no Covid capacity limits or social distancing requirements on public transport. There has been no suggestion from the government either that these will be reintroduced. However, the legal requirement to wear a face covering on public transport remains (unless you are exempt). The rapid spread of Omicron has had a negative impact on public transport, with some services cancelled as staff either test positive or have to self-isolate. Yesterday, more than 100 ScotRail services were cancelledwith staff illness stated as the cause of almost all of them. Underbelly, the organisers of Edinburgh's Hogmanay confirm the event is cancelled, saying the decision was taken with ""the safety of all ticketholders, event
staff and the wider city of Edinburgh"" as their foremost priority. The company says its box office team will contact all ticketholders in early January to
arrange refund options. Co-directors Charlie Wood and Ed Bartlam say in a statement that they are ""incredibly sad"" to announce the news and that after ""such a tough year"" for so many people, they were looking forward to bringing people back
together. âWe know this news will be disappointing for so many people, but we also know that Edinburgh is a wonderfully innovative and resilient city, and we know it will recover from these difficult times and return to the forefront of the worldâs new year celebrations in the future Charlie Wood and Ed Bartlam, Co-directors, Underbelly Question from Margaret in Kinross Presuming that meeting up on the 28 December is your main family celebration, the first minister's previous statement that you don't need to change plans for your main celebration would apply. She has said that she is not asking anyone to cancel or change their plans,externalfor their main family celebration this Christmas. There's also no legal limit on the size of household gatherings which would prevent you from meeting up with your children and grandson. However, Ms Sturgeon has advised that your main celebration be kept ""as small as your family circumstances allow"". So, if you decide to go ahead with this gathering you should take extra measures to make it as safe as possible - which includes making sure everyone in your gathering who can be is vaccinated and has done a test in advance, and that you celebrate in a place that's well-ventilated (so your choice of meeting outdoors is a good idea) and everyone should follows strict hygiene rules. If this is not your main family celebration, then the guidance reducing social interaction at home or in indoor public places to a maximum of three households at any time would apply. Scottish Conservative MSP Murdo Fraser highlights the calls in some quarters for schools to return to a blended learning model in January. But Mr Fraser says the removal of children from the classroom environment can cause them harm and asks the first minister if she will commit to schools reopening without delay next month. Ms Sturgeon says young people have ""suffered disproportionately"" during the pandemic and adds she is committed to schools reopening as scheduled. But she adds the best way to ensure this happens is for everyone to follow the latest Covid guidance in a bid to curb community transmission. Question from Larry in Edinburgh NHS Lothian's current visiting rules,externalstate that visiting is currently restricted to one ""designated"" visitor per patient. The health board says the designated person can change, for example if that person becomes unwell and unable to visit. Most wards will offer a timed visiting appointment per day per patient. There are exceptions to the ""one visit per day"" rule for patients receiving end of life care and patients with dementia or experiencing stress and distress.

Lib Dem leader Alex Cole-Hamilton raises concern for the events sector which he says is ""already on its knees"". He also asks about the pressure self-isolation will put on public services and asks if demand is outstripping national capacity for PCR testing? The first minister accepts the points about events and hospitality and says everything must be done to deliver financial compensation. On the ""pingdemic"" she says people being pinged is ""not the problem"" but people getting the virus is the problem. She says we need to supress the virus and that's where the difficult decisions are coming from. She adds that testing lab capacity is being increased across the UK and that there is ""ample"" capacity at the moment. But, she warns, continued rising cases will put pressure on that capacity.   Question from Andrew in Edinburgh You should get a PCR test if you have symptoms According to the guidance,external, the household of a positive case should self-isolate for the same 10-day period as the first positive case, regardless of vaccination status of anyone in the household. If someone else in the household develops symptoms while self-isolating, they should book a PCR test and if positive, extend their own self-isolation for a further 10 days from their own symptom onset. Other household members do not need to extend their self-isolation if they remain asymptomatic. Lisa SummersBBC Scotland Health Correspondent Public health experts will say it is easier to
pull back if things turn out to be better than expected, rather than to delay
and it be too late. It's all because of the lag in the emergence of true
data. With a new variant in the mix, it can be
confusing at this point in time. What is clear is that Omicron cases in
Scotland are rising. The data on hospitalisations and deaths takes a few more
weeks to emerge, so what we see today is primarily a picture of the Delta
variant. The information on that is good: despite thousands of cases a
day, the numbers in hospital and deaths have been falling. Thatâs down to booster jags providing protection against serious disease. But as Omicron becomes dominant, what we
desperately want is to be able to look into the future: does the new variant
cause severe illness? How well will boosters hold up? Will hospitals cope? Scotland is doing really well on boosters. 59%
of those eligible have had one, more than 90% of those aged over 65. There is also
some evidence that people are already limiting contacts and prioritising some
social interactions over others. But modellers say that even with a 20% decline
in transmission, Omicron would have to be much milder than Delta to avoid a
spike in hospital admissions. The government hopes these new measures after
Christmas will help dampen the impact at the most difficult time of year for
the health service. The more resources the NHS has to dedicate to
Covid, the less available for all the other care it has to deliver. The Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross highlights the disruption staff absences across the public transport network are causing at the moment due to the rapid spread of Omicron. Ms Sturgeon adds it is not self isolation that is causing staff absences but rather the virus. She adds: ""If we don't have households isolating when one member is positive then we will have many more cases of the virus spreading and we will compound rather than alleviate that problem."" The first minister says the government is considering moving towards something ""more proportionate"" as the booster campaign reaches its target but adds such a move at the moment would be ""counter productive."" Question from Janice in Fochabers If someone displays symptoms of Covid then the whole house
must isolate until they have had the results of a PCR test. If a member of the household tests positive then everyone in
the household must self-isolate for 10 days. If someone in the household develops symptoms while self-isolating, they should book a
PCR test. If that is positive, they must extend their self-isolation for a further 10
days from the start of their own symptoms. The latest Scottish government guidance can be foundhere,external. There have been lengthy queues outside new mass vaccination centres in Edinburgh and Glasgow, as more people come forward to receive their booster jab. Vaccination hubs have opened at the Edinburgh International Conference Centre and at Hampden Park stadium in Glasgow. The Scottish government is aiming to deliver 61,000 boosters a day, ensuring 80% of those who are eligible have had their jab by the end of the year. Allow Twitter content?

Freshly-boosted Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar thanks his vaccinator Zara and urges everyone to book a jab as soon as possible and to wear a mask where appropriate. He says the chancellor's announcements ""do not go far enough"" and calls for an increase in statutory sick pay, more business support and a furlough-type scheme. He asks the first minister to review eligibility criteria for self-isolation grants and asks for a framework to be created for future variants. The first minister brings up the ""issue with financing"" she cannot resolve with the UK government. She says that at the least, a targeted furlough scheme should be introduced and will work with other nations to push for this. But Ms Sturgeon says hard decisions need to be made with ""a limited pot of money"". And she says work has begun on long-term health resilience.  Glenn CampbellBBC Scotland Political Editor While there are no changes to the rules and advice for
Christmas gatherings, significant new restrictions will take effect as we head
towards the New Year. Edinburghâs Hogmanay is off for the second year in a row
and big football matches can only be played before the smallest of crowds.  The next Old Firm match on 2 January will be affected by the new rules The return of 1 metre distancing indoors will reduce the capacity of pubs and restaurants, theatres and cinemas - reducing their potential turnover too. There is fresh financial help worth Â£275m from the Scottish government which draws on additional funding announced by the UK Treasury at the weekend. Even though thatâs on top of an initial Â£100m earmarked by Holyrood ministers last week - it is unlikely to be nearly enough to offset the economic damage restrictions will cause. The first minister has renewed calls for the Chancellor to re-introduce a furlough scheme - something the Treasury has not included in the support package it announced today. Allow Twitter content?

Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross encourages everyone to get their booster jag and also urges those who have yet to have their first jab to come forward. He then turns to an ""unnecessary funding row"" between the Scottish and UK governments, which he describes as ""a distraction to the task in hand"". Mr Ross asks when the money will be made available to businesses. The first minister says she is not trying to cause a row over funding but believes there are ""structural problems"" to how they work. She adds theBarnett Formulais ""not fit for purpose"" Question from Joe in Perthshire There is no legal requirement to take a lateral flow test before using public transport in Scotland. However, everyone is encouraged to take one before they travel or socialise, and to take a test at leasttwice a week,external. On public transport you must by law wear a face covering, unless you are exempt, and comply with the physical distancing measures that are in place. One of the main challenges for people using trains, buses, trams and the Glasgow Subway in the coming weeks will be the cancellation of services due to staff shortages. On Monday, ScotRailcancelled 118 services- with staff illness cited as the cause of almost all of them. This was due to a combination of positive Covid cases and the 10 day self-isolation rules. This video can not be played Ms Sturgeon announces that large events - including Hogmanay events - will be banned Most of the measures announced by the first minister will be in place for three weeks after Christmas Day. Here are the main points:  Ms Sturgeon admits her statement ""feels distressingly
similar"" to the one she gave this time last year. But she says the country is in a stronger position thanks to the protection of the vaccine and adds: ""Christmas Day will be more normal."" She ends by urging everyone to get fully vaccinated as soon as possible and test regularly. The first minister also highlights the importance of other precautions such as face coverings, working from home and mixing with no more than three households. I want to end with a heartfelt thank you to everyone - for everything you have done to help us through another tough year. I wish everyone the happiest and safest Christmas possible - and a much better, brighter new year. Nicola Sturgeon, First Minister Â© 2025 BBC.

Sex and the City stars give support to Chris Noth accusersThree Sex And The City actresses issue a joint statement after co-star is accused of sexual assault.,"Chris Noth most recently starred in the Sex And The City sequel, And Just Like That... with Sarah Jessica Parker The leading actresses of the Sex And The City TV show have expressed support for two women who have accused their co-star Chris Noth of sexual assault. Sarah Jessica Parker, Cynthia Nixon and Kristin Davis said they were ""deeply saddened"" to hear of the allegations. ""We support the women who have come forward and shared their painful experiences,"" they said in a joint statement. Mr Noth, 67, has rejected the accusations as ""categorically false"". The actor, who played the character of Mr Big in the hugely popular series - the main love interest for Sarah Jessica Parker's protagonist - has said the encounters with both women were consensual. However he has been dropped from several contracts since the allegations were made in The Hollywood Reporter magazine last week. Four days on from the initial reports, US networks CBS and Universal Television confirmed that Mr Noth had been sacked from his current show, The Equaliser. Fitness brand Peloton removed an advert featuring him from its social media pages last week. The statement, issued on all three actresses' social media pages, comes just a fortnight after a sequel to Sex And The City was released, entitled And Just Like That... in which Mr Noth reprised his role as Mr Big.

The women who have accused Mr Noth of sexual assaulttold The Hollywood Reporter,externalthat seeing him on the new show had prompted them to come forward. They gave detailed accounts of the alleged assaults to the magazine, under the pseudonyms Zoe and Lily. Zoe, now 40, says she was 22 years old when the actor allegedly raped her at an apartment in West Hollywood in 2004. Lily, now 31, says she was raped in his Greenwich Village apartment in New York City in 2015 when she was 25 and he was 60. The detailed article by journalist Kim Masters also interviews people such as Zoe's boss at the time, a rape treatment centre and a friend of Lily's whose accounts all seem to back up both women's claims. The article also quotes text messages purportedly between Mr Noth and Lily at the time of the alleged assault. Mr Noth has said in a statement to US outlets: ""The accusations against me made by individuals I met years, even decades, ago are categorically false. ""These stories could've been from 30 years ago or 30 days ago - no always means no - that is a line I did not cross. The encounters were consensual."" ""It's difficult not to question the timing of these stories coming out. I don't know for certain why they are surfacing now, but I do know this: I did not assault these women."" Los Angeles Police has said the allegations have not led to an investigation because no official report has been made to police.

Yesterday, more than 100 ScotRail services were cancelledwith staff illness stated as the cause of almost all of them. Underbelly, the organisers of Edinburgh's Hogmanay confirm the event is cancelled, saying the decision was taken with ""the safety of all ticketholders, event
staff and the wider city of Edinburgh"" as their foremost priority. The company says its box office team will contact all ticketholders in early January to
arrange refund options. Co-directors Charlie Wood and Ed Bartlam say in a statement that they are ""incredibly sad"" to announce the news and that after ""such a tough year"" for so many people, they were looking forward to bringing people back
together. âWe know this news will be disappointing for so many people, but we also know that Edinburgh is a wonderfully innovative and resilient city, and we know it will recover from these difficult times and return to the forefront of the worldâs new year celebrations in the future Charlie Wood and Ed Bartlam, Co-directors, Underbelly Question from Margaret in Kinross Presuming that meeting up on the 28 December is your main family celebration, the first minister's previous statement that you don't need to change plans for your main celebration would apply. She has said that she is not asking anyone to cancel or change their plans,externalfor their main family celebration this Christmas. There's also no legal limit on the size of household gatherings which would prevent you from meeting up with your children and grandson. However, Ms Sturgeon has advised that your main celebration be kept ""as small as your family circumstances allow"". So, if you decide to go ahead with this gathering you should take extra measures to make it as safe as possible - which includes making sure everyone in your gathering who can be is vaccinated and has done a test in advance, and that you celebrate in a place that's well-ventilated (so your choice of meeting outdoors is a good idea) and everyone should follows strict hygiene rules. If this is not your main family celebration, then the guidance reducing social interaction at home or in indoor public places to a maximum of three households at any time would apply. Scottish Conservative MSP Murdo Fraser highlights the calls in some quarters for schools to return to a blended learning model in January. But Mr Fraser says the removal of children from the classroom environment can cause them harm and asks the first minister if she will commit to schools reopening without delay next month. Ms Sturgeon says young people have ""suffered disproportionately"" during the pandemic and adds she is committed to schools reopening as scheduled. But she adds the best way to ensure this happens is for everyone to follow the latest Covid guidance in a bid to curb community transmission. Question from Larry in Edinburgh NHS Lothian's current visiting rules,externalstate that visiting is currently restricted to one ""designated"" visitor per patient. The health board says the designated person can change, for example if that person becomes unwell and unable to visit. Most wards will offer a timed visiting appointment per day per patient. There are exceptions to the ""one visit per day"" rule for patients receiving end of life care and patients with dementia or experiencing stress and distress.

Lib Dem leader Alex Cole-Hamilton raises concern for the events sector which he says is ""already on its knees"". He also asks about the pressure self-isolation will put on public services and asks if demand is outstripping national capacity for PCR testing? The first minister accepts the points about events and hospitality and says everything must be done to deliver financial compensation. On the ""pingdemic"" she says people being pinged is ""not the problem"" but people getting the virus is the problem. She says we need to supress the virus and that's where the difficult decisions are coming from. She adds that testing lab capacity is being increased across the UK and that there is ""ample"" capacity at the moment. But, she warns, continued rising cases will put pressure on that capacity.   Question from Andrew in Edinburgh You should get a PCR test if you have symptoms According to the guidance,external, the household of a positive case should self-isolate for the same 10-day period as the first positive case, regardless of vaccination status of anyone in the household. If someone else in the household develops symptoms while self-isolating, they should book a PCR test and if positive, extend their own self-isolation for a further 10 days from their own symptom onset. Other household members do not need to extend their self-isolation if they remain asymptomatic. Lisa SummersBBC Scotland Health Correspondent Public health experts will say it is easier to
pull back if things turn out to be better than expected, rather than to delay
and it be too late. It's all because of the lag in the emergence of true
data. With a new variant in the mix, it can be
confusing at this point in time. What is clear is that Omicron cases in
Scotland are rising. The data on hospitalisations and deaths takes a few more
weeks to emerge, so what we see today is primarily a picture of the Delta
variant. The information on that is good: despite thousands of cases a
day, the numbers in hospital and deaths have been falling. Thatâs down to booster jags providing protection against serious disease. But as Omicron becomes dominant, what we
desperately want is to be able to look into the future: does the new variant
cause severe illness? How well will boosters hold up? Will hospitals cope? Scotland is doing really well on boosters. 59%
of those eligible have had one, more than 90% of those aged over 65. There is also
some evidence that people are already limiting contacts and prioritising some
social interactions over others. But modellers say that even with a 20% decline
in transmission, Omicron would have to be much milder than Delta to avoid a
spike in hospital admissions. The government hopes these new measures after
Christmas will help dampen the impact at the most difficult time of year for
the health service. The more resources the NHS has to dedicate to
Covid, the less available for all the other care it has to deliver. The Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross highlights the disruption staff absences across the public transport network are causing at the moment due to the rapid spread of Omicron. Ms Sturgeon adds it is not self isolation that is causing staff absences but rather the virus. She adds: ""If we don't have households isolating when one member is positive then we will have many more cases of the virus spreading and we will compound rather than alleviate that problem."" The first minister says the government is considering moving towards something ""more proportionate"" as the booster campaign reaches its target but adds such a move at the moment would be ""counter productive."" Question from Janice in Fochabers If someone displays symptoms of Covid then the whole house
must isolate until they have had the results of a PCR test. If a member of the household tests positive then everyone in
the household must self-isolate for 10 days. If someone in the household develops symptoms while self-isolating, they should book a
PCR test. If that is positive, they must extend their self-isolation for a further 10
days from the start of their own symptoms. The latest Scottish government guidance can be foundhere,external. There have been lengthy queues outside new mass vaccination centres in Edinburgh and Glasgow, as more people come forward to receive their booster jab. Vaccination hubs have opened at the Edinburgh International Conference Centre and at Hampden Park stadium in Glasgow. The Scottish government is aiming to deliver 61,000 boosters a day, ensuring 80% of those who are eligible have had their jab by the end of the year. Allow Twitter content?

Freshly-boosted Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar thanks his vaccinator Zara and urges everyone to book a jab as soon as possible and to wear a mask where appropriate. He says the chancellor's announcements ""do not go far enough"" and calls for an increase in statutory sick pay, more business support and a furlough-type scheme. He asks the first minister to review eligibility criteria for self-isolation grants and asks for a framework to be created for future variants. The first minister brings up the ""issue with financing"" she cannot resolve with the UK government. She says that at the least, a targeted furlough scheme should be introduced and will work with other nations to push for this. But Ms Sturgeon says hard decisions need to be made with ""a limited pot of money"". And she says work has begun on long-term health resilience.  Glenn CampbellBBC Scotland Political Editor While there are no changes to the rules and advice for
Christmas gatherings, significant new restrictions will take effect as we head
towards the New Year. Edinburghâs Hogmanay is off for the second year in a row
and big football matches can only be played before the smallest of crowds.  The next Old Firm match on 2 January will be affected by the new rules The return of 1 metre distancing indoors will reduce the capacity of pubs and restaurants, theatres and cinemas - reducing their potential turnover too. There is fresh financial help worth Â£275m from the Scottish government which draws on additional funding announced by the UK Treasury at the weekend. Even though thatâs on top of an initial Â£100m earmarked by Holyrood ministers last week - it is unlikely to be nearly enough to offset the economic damage restrictions will cause. The first minister has renewed calls for the Chancellor to re-introduce a furlough scheme - something the Treasury has not included in the support package it announced today. Allow Twitter content?

Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross encourages everyone to get their booster jag and also urges those who have yet to have their first jab to come forward. He then turns to an ""unnecessary funding row"" between the Scottish and UK governments, which he describes as ""a distraction to the task in hand"". Mr Ross asks when the money will be made available to businesses. The first minister says she is not trying to cause a row over funding but believes there are ""structural problems"" to how they work. She adds theBarnett Formulais ""not fit for purpose"" Question from Joe in Perthshire There is no legal requirement to take a lateral flow test before using public transport in Scotland. However, everyone is encouraged to take one before they travel or socialise, and to take a test at leasttwice a week,external. On public transport you must by law wear a face covering, unless you are exempt, and comply with the physical distancing measures that are in place. One of the main challenges for people using trains, buses, trams and the Glasgow Subway in the coming weeks will be the cancellation of services due to staff shortages. On Monday, ScotRailcancelled 118 services- with staff illness cited as the cause of almost all of them. This was due to a combination of positive Covid cases and the 10 day self-isolation rules. This video can not be played Ms Sturgeon announces that large events - including Hogmanay events - will be banned Most of the measures announced by the first minister will be in place for three weeks after Christmas Day. Here are the main points:  Ms Sturgeon admits her statement ""feels distressingly
similar"" to the one she gave this time last year. But she says the country is in a stronger position thanks to the protection of the vaccine and adds: ""Christmas Day will be more normal."" She ends by urging everyone to get fully vaccinated as soon as possible and test regularly. The first minister also highlights the importance of other precautions such as face coverings, working from home and mixing with no more than three households. I want to end with a heartfelt thank you to everyone - for everything you have done to help us through another tough year. I wish everyone the happiest and safest Christmas possible - and a much better, brighter new year. Nicola Sturgeon, First Minister Â© 2025 BBC.

"Breaking|Breaking newsHogmanay events cancelled as Covid rules tightenedOutdoor events including football matches will be limited to 500 people, and indoor to a maximum of 200.Scotland politics","This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon says Scotland's large-scale Hogmanay celebrations ""will not proceed"" Edinburgh's Hogmanay events have been cancelled and football matches will be effectively spectator-free as part of tough new Covid rules in Scotland. All outdoor events will be limited to just 500 people to help slow the spread of Omicron. Indoor events such as concerts will be limited to 200 people if they are seated, or 100 for standing. The new restrictions come into force on Boxing Day. They will be in place for three weeks - although there will be no limit to how many people can meet up at Christmas. The Old Firm derby between Celtic and Rangers on 2 January and the Edinburgh derby between Hearts and Hibs the following day are among the football fixtures that will be affected by the new rules. Crowds vastly reduced for Scottish sport What are the Covid rules in Scotland? Edinburgh cancellation 'incredibly sad' The government fears that last Sunday's League Cup Final in front of a capacity crowd at Hampden may have been a ""super spreader"" event, with Deputy First Minister John Swinney saying he regrets not making the decision to play matches without spectators sooner. Celtic have asked for the Scottish Premiership's three-week winter break - which is due to start after the Edinburgh derby on 3 January - to bebrought forwardto ""maximise the prospect of all supporters being able to attend matches and support the game they love."" All of the major Hogmanay events in Edinburgh - including the street party, the torchlit precession and the midnight firework display - have now been cancelled, as have many other events in towns and cities across the country. Edinburgh's annual torchlight procession, which takes place on 30 December, has also been cancelled Physical distancing of 1m will now need to be in place for all events that do go ahead under the restrictions. Pubs and other hospitality venues selling alcohol will need to reintroduce table service from 27 December. And indoor hospitality and leisure venues will be required to ensure there is a 1m distance between groups of people who are attending together - which could force nightclubs to close. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: ""This will of course make sports matches, including football, effectively spectator-free over this three week period. ""And it will also mean that large-scale Hogmanay celebrations - including that planned here in our capital city - will not proceed"". Wales had already announced plans for sporting events to beheld without crowdsfrom Boxing Day, and London hascancelled its New Year's Eve eventin Trafalgar Square. Many concerts, theatre productions and other events had already been cancelled voluntarily in Scotland. The Celtic-Rangers match on 2 January will be one of the fixtures affected by the new rules Omicron is now thought to account for 62.9% of all Covid cases in Scotland, with the first minister saying there was ""still no compelling evidence that Omicron is intrinsically milder than previous strains"". Ms Sturgeon said the much higher transmissibility of the new variant meant that large gatherings ""have the potential to become very rapid super-spreader events, putting large numbers at risk of getting infected very quickly"". She added: ""Limiting these events helps reduce the risk of widespread transmission. It also cuts down the transmission risks associated with travel to and from such events ""And these large events put an additional burden on emergency services, especially the police and ambulance services. ""At a time when these services are already under severe pressure and also dealing with high staff absences, limiting large scale events will help them focus on delivering essential services to the public."" Pubs will need to reintroduce table service from 27 December Ms Sturgeon stressed that the priority for the government was to ensure that schools re-open as normal after the Christmas holidays. And she again urged people to cut their contacts with people in other households as much as possible ahead of Christmas, and to stay at home as much as possible. The Federation of Small Business said the new measures would make trading ""drastically more difficult for huge numbers of small businesses in Scotland"". Its policy chair, Andrew McRae, said: ""The social distancing restrictions will mean shops and hospitality firms can serve fewer customers. ""And the changes to events, such as sports matches and Hogmanay celebrations, will have a knock-on impact on local economies."" The Scottish Licensed Traders Association said the restrictions would be a ""knockout blow""  to many businesses that were already struggling because of the pandemic. The Scottish government will now double the Â£100m it had already pledged to businesses hit by new Omicron restrictions. And Ms Sturgeon said recent announcements by the UK Treasury ""give us additional spending power now of Â£175m"" - bringing the total to Â£375m, all of which will be allocated to business support. While there are no changes to the rules and advice for Christmas gatherings, significant new restrictions will take effect as we head towards the new year.

The first minister has renewed calls for the Chancellor to re-introduce a furlough scheme - something the Treasury has not included in the support package it announced today. Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said he understood the ""frustration and anger"" that many people would have over the new restrictions, but urged people to come forward for vaccination as the ""best way out of this"". He also called for household contacts of Covid cases to be allowed to end their self-isolation if they test negative, saying the current rules were well-intentioned but could ""grind our transport network, our economy and public services to a halt"". ScotRail cancelled more than 100 trains on Monday, largely because of crew members being affected by Covid. Ms Sturgeon said the government was ""actively considering"" changing household isolation rules once the booster campaign is complete, but said it would be ""counter-productive"" to do so while case numbers are rising. Meanwhile Scottish Labour's Anas Sarwar said there should be ""much more significant financial support"" for businesses and a ""furlough-type scheme"" for sectors which are effectively shut down.

Scottish Power debt team filmed raiding wrong homeThe men entered the flat while the occupier was out - even though she is not a Scottish Power customer.Scotland,"This video can not be played Footage appears to show debt collectors breaking into the flat of someone who has never been a Scottish Power customer Scottish Power debt enforcers have been caught on camera breaking into a woman's flat seeking payment for debts she did not owe. The woman was on holiday at the time and was not a Scottish Power customer. Doorbell video footage shows two uniformed men tampering with locks before going into the flat and identifying themselves as Scottish Power representatives. The energy firm has admitted the error, apologised and offered compensation. It is the latest in a series of reports from BBC Scotland featuring allegations of heavy-handed measures by representatives of Scottish Power. The UK energy regulator Ofgem has now opened discussions with Scottish Power following the claims. Probe into 'aggressive' energy debt tactics Woman 'harassed' by power firm over false debt The woman's father said his daughter was on holiday in the north of Scotland on 20 August when she received an alert from the video doorbell. Donald Maciver, 60, said she saw there were two men at the door and she realised they were trying to break into the flat. ""She tried to engage with them through the intercom and they chose to ignore that, and then watched for a period of 43 seconds as two guys walked through the door,"" he said. This video can not be played Scottish Power debt enforcement team raid wrong home Mr Maciver said he drove from his home in St Andrews to the property in Glasgow to investigate. ""I got down there and walked into the flat and couldn't see anything,"" he said. ""It was like nobody had been there, it was absolutely nothing there at all. If it hadn't been for the video footage, nobody would have known anyone had been in this flat. ""Yet two men were in this flat for 27 minutes, nobody can explain to me what they were doing in a two-bedroom flat for 27 minutes. They were supposed to be looking for gas meters - a gas meter that happens to be in the basement."" Mr Maciver later found a letter from a debt collection firm addressed to someone who did not live in any of the flats that shared his daughter's stairwell. He said his daughter had reported the letters three times to Scottish Power but they kept sending written demands for unpaid money. Mr Maciver said he faced a ""denial culture"" at the energy firm when he tried to complain. ""Even though you're not the customer - never have been a customer - you are wrong, they are right,"" he said. ""It's up to you to prove you don't owe them money as opposed to them proving to you that you do."" He eventually received a letter in which Scottish Power admitted the error after contacting the CEO's office. It states: ""I sincerely apologised that we had attended the wrong address and I confirmed that your daughter's property was supplied by SSE. ""In view of the upset caused, I offered your daughter Â£500 as a gesture of goodwill and advised you that we were continuing to investigate which flat we do supply, your daughters' details were removed from our system."" Irene Girvan said she felt she was not being listened to It follows the case of Irene Girvan, from Glasgow, who claimed the energy giant hounded her for a year over money she insists she did not owe. The 64-year-old told BBC Scotland she was threatened with debt collectors and missed a Covid booster jab while waiting for enforcement officers she believed were coming to change her locks. Scottish Power has apologised for distress caused to Ms Girvan and cleared the debt. Officials said there was ""no excuse for our failures"" in this case. An Ofgem spokeswoman said:  ""We treat seriously all allegations of customers not being treated fairly, and take action where appropriate. ""We have contacted Scottish Power over their investigation into the allegations reported by the BBC. ""Debt management activities must be done in a fair and reasonable way at all times. Suppliers cannot extend unlimited credit to customers, but we will not tolerate sharp practice or aggressive debt collection."" On Friday, Scottish Power launched a probe after a whistleblower told the BBC that call handlers working on behalf of the energy giant were told to threaten customers with debt enforcement - even over mistaken bills. The man, an employee of an outsourced company, works in a call centre in the west of Scotland dealing with people who call to query outstanding balances. The employee, who says he wants to protect his identity over fears he will lose his job, said it was clear to see where errors had been made on an account. He said: ""It may be a wrong meter reading, they've not been billed correctly, they might not be responsible for it, or they're not a Scottish Power customer. However, until that's dealt with then it's going to stand, we're going pursue them for that debt. A Scottish Power spokesman said: ""Scottish Power does not have processes or is it our intention to pursue account holders who have not been customers of Scottish Power. ""Like every other energy company in the UK we will follow up any existing debt a Scottish Power customer owes after they have switched to another supplier. ""Your source's allegations on our debt management policies are all untrue."" Following the volume of people getting in touch with the BBC raising concerns, Scottish Power has asked people to email Contactus@scottishpower.com with BBC Account Query in the title.

Month delay before incorrect Covid tests halted,"Testing at the Immensa Health Clinic in Wolverhampton was suspended after the errors were discovered Discrepancies in Covid test results were spotted a month before testing was halted at one lab, court papers show. More than 43,000 people received incorrect results aftererrors at the Immensa laboratory in Wolverhampton. Many ofthose affected live in the south west of England. Documents show the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) was alerted to the unusual figures on 14 September. Tests at the lab were suspended on 12 October and an investigation is ongoing. The UKHSA said it ""cannot comment on any information that could form part of these investigations before they are complete"". It said: ""We suspended testing at the Immensa Wolverhampton laboratory following an ongoing investigation into positive LFD (lateral flow) results subsequently testing negative on PCR. ""Those affected were contacted as soon as possible."" Immensa said it was fully cooperating with the investigation. It's hard to realise what the Immensa problems mean without putting a human face on it. Although thousands of people affected had been contacted by the UKHSA, there are also many families who have not. People like Amber Marshall from Stonehouse in Gloucestershire, whose 84-year-old grandmother Pam Bembenek died in October after being infected by a care home worker who had wrongly been given the all clear. So ripples of this serious incident may extend far beyond what we already have been told. Concerns were raised when people with positive lateral flow test results received negative follow-up PCR results between 8 September and 12 October. It is estimated thatabout 43,000 people may have been given incorrect results. The errors led to people infected with Covid being mistakenly advised to stop isolating, increasing the risk of potentially infecting others. The court documents showed Immensa was only required to routinely report tests that had produced no result, along with information about how fast the laboratory was turning tests around. There were no checks to see how results compared with other laboratories - something that has since changed. Andrew Preston, a microbiologist from the University of Bath, said: ""This is an issue that should have been flagged very soon after it started to arise, and then there should be procedures in place to at least know what's going on - and say 'hold on a minute' and say 'we need to go in'. ""And then in that case, if you have doubts over the veracity of your testing programme you cannot continue to test live samples if you are not convinced by the results."" Campaign group The Good Law Project, which has launched a judicial review over the government's handling of the issue, said many of the laboratory's discrepancies had been discovered through social media. It said: ""When did we become reliant upon citizens to check that box fresh companies, unaccredited with Â£120m of public contracts, are delivering?""

"Breaking|Breaking newsHogmanay events cancelled as Covid rules tightenedOutdoor events including football matches will be limited to 500 people, and indoor to a maximum of 200.Scotland politicsMan in court charged with murder of 18-year-oldLily Sullivan's body was found on Friday morning, with a 31-year-old man charged with her murder.Wales","This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon says Scotland's large-scale Hogmanay celebrations ""will not proceed"" Edinburgh's Hogmanay events have been cancelled and football matches will be effectively spectator-free as part of tough new Covid rules in Scotland. All outdoor events will be limited to just 500 people to help slow the spread of Omicron. Indoor events such as concerts will be limited to 200 people if they are seated, or 100 for standing. The new restrictions come into force on Boxing Day. They will be in place for three weeks - although there will be no limit to how many people can meet up at Christmas. The Old Firm derby between Celtic and Rangers on 2 January and the Edinburgh derby between Hearts and Hibs the following day are among the football fixtures that will be affected by the new rules. Crowds vastly reduced for Scottish sport What are the Covid rules in Scotland? Edinburgh cancellation 'incredibly sad' The government fears that last Sunday's League Cup Final in front of a capacity crowd at Hampden may have been a ""super spreader"" event, with Deputy First Minister John Swinney saying he regrets not making the decision to play matches without spectators sooner. Celtic have asked for the Scottish Premiership's three-week winter break - which is due to start after the Edinburgh derby on 3 January - to bebrought forwardto ""maximise the prospect of all supporters being able to attend matches and support the game they love."" All of the major Hogmanay events in Edinburgh - including the street party, the torchlit precession and the midnight firework display - have now been cancelled, as have many other events in towns and cities across the country. Edinburgh's annual torchlight procession, which takes place on 30 December, has also been cancelled Physical distancing of 1m will now need to be in place for all events that do go ahead under the restrictions. Pubs and other hospitality venues selling alcohol will need to reintroduce table service from 27 December. And indoor hospitality and leisure venues will be required to ensure there is a 1m distance between groups of people who are attending together - which could force nightclubs to close. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: ""This will of course make sports matches, including football, effectively spectator-free over this three week period. ""And it will also mean that large-scale Hogmanay celebrations - including that planned here in our capital city - will not proceed"". Wales had already announced plans for sporting events to beheld without crowdsfrom Boxing Day, and London hascancelled its New Year's Eve eventin Trafalgar Square. Many concerts, theatre productions and other events had already been cancelled voluntarily in Scotland. The Celtic-Rangers match on 2 January will be one of the fixtures affected by the new rules Omicron is now thought to account for 62.9% of all Covid cases in Scotland, with the first minister saying there was ""still no compelling evidence that Omicron is intrinsically milder than previous strains"". Ms Sturgeon said the much higher transmissibility of the new variant meant that large gatherings ""have the potential to become very rapid super-spreader events, putting large numbers at risk of getting infected very quickly"". She added: ""Limiting these events helps reduce the risk of widespread transmission. It also cuts down the transmission risks associated with travel to and from such events ""And these large events put an additional burden on emergency services, especially the police and ambulance services. ""At a time when these services are already under severe pressure and also dealing with high staff absences, limiting large scale events will help them focus on delivering essential services to the public."" Pubs will need to reintroduce table service from 27 December Ms Sturgeon stressed that the priority for the government was to ensure that schools re-open as normal after the Christmas holidays. And she again urged people to cut their contacts with people in other households as much as possible ahead of Christmas, and to stay at home as much as possible. The Federation of Small Business said the new measures would make trading ""drastically more difficult for huge numbers of small businesses in Scotland"". Its policy chair, Andrew McRae, said: ""The social distancing restrictions will mean shops and hospitality firms can serve fewer customers. ""And the changes to events, such as sports matches and Hogmanay celebrations, will have a knock-on impact on local economies."" The Scottish Licensed Traders Association said the restrictions would be a ""knockout blow""  to many businesses that were already struggling because of the pandemic. The Scottish government will now double the Â£100m it had already pledged to businesses hit by new Omicron restrictions. And Ms Sturgeon said recent announcements by the UK Treasury ""give us additional spending power now of Â£175m"" - bringing the total to Â£375m, all of which will be allocated to business support. While there are no changes to the rules and advice for Christmas gatherings, significant new restrictions will take effect as we head towards the new year. Edinburgh's Hogmanay is off for the second year in a row and big football matches can only be played before the smallest of crowds. The return of one metre distancing indoors will reduce the capacity of pubs and restaurants, theatres and cinemas - reducing their potential turnover too. There is fresh financial help worth Â£275m from the Scottish government which draws on additional funding announced by the UK Treasury at the weekend. Even though that's on top of an initial Â£100m earmarked by Holyrood ministers last week - it is unlikely to be nearly enough to offset the economic damage restrictions will cause. The first minister has renewed calls for the Chancellor to re-introduce a furlough scheme - something the Treasury has not included in the support package it announced today. Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said he understood the ""frustration and anger"" that many people would have over the new restrictions, but urged people to come forward for vaccination as the ""best way out of this"". He also called for household contacts of Covid cases to be allowed to end their self-isolation if they test negative, saying the current rules were well-intentioned but could ""grind our transport network, our economy and public services to a halt"". ScotRail cancelled more than 100 trains on Monday, largely because of crew members being affected by Covid. Ms Sturgeon said the government was ""actively considering"" changing household isolation rules once the booster campaign is complete, but said it would be ""counter-productive"" to do so while case numbers are rising. Meanwhile Scottish Labour's Anas Sarwar said there should be ""much more significant financial support"" for businesses and a ""furlough-type scheme"" for sectors which are effectively shut down.

Nicola Sturgeon gives update on Covid restrictions,"Nicola Sturgeon tells MSPs that Omicron has firmly established itself as the dominate strain in Scotland - it is nearly 63% of all cases In light of the Covid threat, the first minister says that large-scale Hogmanay celebrations - including Edinburgh's famous street party - ""will not proceed"" She adds that sporting fixtures, including football matches, will be ""effectively spectator-free"" from 26 December until mid-January Ms Sturgeon had already said there would be no change to the rules or advice around Christmas Day, but she reiterates guidance that people should limit their contacts from 27 December The FM's statement says that it remains the Scottish government's priority to ""open schools as normal"" after the holidays Scotland's Covid cases have increased by more than 50% in the past week with a 161% jump in those aged 20 to 24 BBC Scotland News Here are the main points from the first minister's Covid update:  Allow Twitter content?

Thanks for joining us and please stay safe.  Business leaders are calling for fast movement on getting cash to the businesses that need it. Andrew McRae from The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) Scotland, said that the measures announced would make trading ""drastically more difficult"" for huge numbers of small businesses. He said: ""After a
disappointing festive trading period, these moves will heap pressure on local
firms and the self-employed. ""The same group of businesses that took the
greatest hit earlier in the crisis now face another gruelling winter and
spring. ""These operators now face tough decisions about whether they open their
doors with restrictions in place or stop trading until theyâre lifted.""  For the second year running Edinburgh's famous celebrations will be muted as a result of Covid Edinburgh City Council leader Adam McVey acknowledges how disappointing it will be for young people to have their New Year plans ended. But he says that their priority must always be to protect the health and
wellbeing of the public, staff and the city. Given the spread of this variant, reflected in the rising infection numbers, we need to avoid any additional burden on our health and emergency services. Iâm grateful to the Scottish Government, Public Health, NHS and Police for their engagement with our teams to keep the City as safe as possible as we grapple with these challenges through the festive period. I would encourage everyone to continue following the guidance and to please celebrate Hogmanay safely and responsibly. Adam McVey, Leader, Edinburgh City Council Question from Nina in Glasgow There are currently no Covid capacity limits or social distancing requirements on public transport. There has been no suggestion from the government either that these will be reintroduced. However, the legal requirement to wear a face covering on public transport remains (unless you are exempt). The rapid spread of Omicron has had a negative impact on public transport, with some services cancelled as staff either test positive or have to self-isolate. Yesterday, more than 100 ScotRail services were cancelledwith staff illness stated as the cause of almost all of them. Underbelly, the organisers of Edinburgh's Hogmanay confirm the event is cancelled, saying the decision was taken with ""the safety of all ticketholders, event
staff and the wider city of Edinburgh"" as their foremost priority. The company says its box office team will contact all ticketholders in early January to
arrange refund options. Co-directors Charlie Wood and Ed Bartlam say in a statement that they are ""incredibly sad"" to announce the news and that after ""such a tough year"" for so many people, they were looking forward to bringing people back
together. âWe know this news will be disappointing for so many people, but we also know that Edinburgh is a wonderfully innovative and resilient city, and we know it will recover from these difficult times and return to the forefront of the worldâs new year celebrations in the future Charlie Wood and Ed Bartlam, Co-directors, Underbelly Question from Margaret in Kinross Presuming that meeting up on the 28 December is your main family celebration, the first minister's previous statement that you don't need to change plans for your main celebration would apply. She has said that she is not asking anyone to cancel or change their plans,externalfor their main family celebration this Christmas. There's also no legal limit on the size of household gatherings which would prevent you from meeting up with your children and grandson. However, Ms Sturgeon has advised that your main celebration be kept ""as small as your family circumstances allow"". So, if you decide to go ahead with this gathering you should take extra measures to make it as safe as possible - which includes making sure everyone in your gathering who can be is vaccinated and has done a test in advance, and that you celebrate in a place that's well-ventilated (so your choice of meeting outdoors is a good idea) and everyone should follows strict hygiene rules. If this is not your main family celebration, then the guidance reducing social interaction at home or in indoor public places to a maximum of three households at any time would apply. Scottish Conservative MSP Murdo Fraser highlights the calls in some quarters for schools to return to a blended learning model in January. But Mr Fraser says the removal of children from the classroom environment can cause them harm and asks the first minister if she will commit to schools reopening without delay next month. Ms Sturgeon says young people have ""suffered disproportionately"" during the pandemic and adds she is committed to schools reopening as scheduled. But she adds the best way to ensure this happens is for everyone to follow the latest Covid guidance in a bid to curb community transmission. Question from Larry in Edinburgh NHS Lothian's current visiting rules,externalstate that visiting is currently restricted to one ""designated"" visitor per patient. The health board says the designated person can change, for example if that person becomes unwell and unable to visit. Most wards will offer a timed visiting appointment per day per patient. There are exceptions to the ""one visit per day"" rule for patients receiving end of life care and patients with dementia or experiencing stress and distress.

Lib Dem leader Alex Cole-Hamilton raises concern for the events sector which he says is ""already on its knees"". He also asks about the pressure self-isolation will put on public services and asks if demand is outstripping national capacity for PCR testing? The first minister accepts the points about events and hospitality and says everything must be done to deliver financial compensation. On the ""pingdemic"" she says people being pinged is ""not the problem"" but people getting the virus is the problem. She says we need to supress the virus and that's where the difficult decisions are coming from. She adds that testing lab capacity is being increased across the UK and that there is ""ample"" capacity at the moment. But, she warns, continued rising cases will put pressure on that capacity.   Question from Andrew in Edinburgh You should get a PCR test if you have symptoms According to the guidance,external, the household of a positive case should self-isolate for the same 10-day period as the first positive case, regardless of vaccination status of anyone in the household. If someone else in the household develops symptoms while self-isolating, they should book a PCR test and if positive, extend their own self-isolation for a further 10 days from their own symptom onset. Other household members do not need to extend their self-isolation if they remain asymptomatic. Lisa SummersBBC Scotland Health Correspondent Public health experts will say it is easier to
pull back if things turn out to be better than expected, rather than to delay
and it be too late. It's all because of the lag in the emergence of true
data. With a new variant in the mix, it can be
confusing at this point in time. What is clear is that Omicron cases in
Scotland are rising. The data on hospitalisations and deaths takes a few more
weeks to emerge, so what we see today is primarily a picture of the Delta
variant. The information on that is good: despite thousands of cases a
day, the numbers in hospital and deaths have been falling. Thatâs down to booster jags providing protection against serious disease. But as Omicron becomes dominant, what we
desperately want is to be able to look into the future: does the new variant
cause severe illness? How well will boosters hold up? Will hospitals cope? Scotland is doing really well on boosters. 59%
of those eligible have had one, more than 90% of those aged over 65. There is also
some evidence that people are already limiting contacts and prioritising some
social interactions over others. But modellers say that even with a 20% decline
in transmission, Omicron would have to be much milder than Delta to avoid a
spike in hospital admissions. The government hopes these new measures after
Christmas will help dampen the impact at the most difficult time of year for
the health service. The more resources the NHS has to dedicate to
Covid, the less available for all the other care it has to deliver. The Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross highlights the disruption staff absences across the public transport network are causing at the moment due to the rapid spread of Omicron. Ms Sturgeon adds it is not self isolation that is causing staff absences but rather the virus. She adds: ""If we don't have households isolating when one member is positive then we will have many more cases of the virus spreading and we will compound rather than alleviate that problem."" The first minister says the government is considering moving towards something ""more proportionate"" as the booster campaign reaches its target but adds such a move at the moment would be ""counter productive."" Question from Janice in Fochabers If someone displays symptoms of Covid then the whole house
must isolate until they have had the results of a PCR test. If a member of the household tests positive then everyone in
the household must self-isolate for 10 days. If someone in the household develops symptoms while self-isolating, they should book a
PCR test. If that is positive, they must extend their self-isolation for a further 10
days from the start of their own symptoms. The latest Scottish government guidance can be foundhere,external. There have been lengthy queues outside new mass vaccination centres in Edinburgh and Glasgow, as more people come forward to receive their booster jab. Vaccination hubs have opened at the Edinburgh International Conference Centre and at Hampden Park stadium in Glasgow. The Scottish government is aiming to deliver 61,000 boosters a day, ensuring 80% of those who are eligible have had their jab by the end of the year. Allow Twitter content?

Freshly-boosted Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar thanks his vaccinator Zara and urges everyone to book a jab as soon as possible and to wear a mask where appropriate. He says the chancellor's announcements ""do not go far enough"" and calls for an increase in statutory sick pay, more business support and a furlough-type scheme. He asks the first minister to review eligibility criteria for self-isolation grants and asks for a framework to be created for future variants. The first minister brings up the ""issue with financing"" she cannot resolve with the UK government. She says that at the least, a targeted furlough scheme should be introduced and will work with other nations to push for this. But Ms Sturgeon says hard decisions need to be made with ""a limited pot of money"". And she says work has begun on long-term health resilience.  Glenn CampbellBBC Scotland Political Editor While there are no changes to the rules and advice for
Christmas gatherings, significant new restrictions will take effect as we head
towards the New Year. Edinburghâs Hogmanay is off for the second year in a row
and big football matches can only be played before the smallest of crowds.  The next Old Firm match on 2 January will be affected by the new rules The return of 1 metre distancing indoors will reduce the capacity of pubs and restaurants, theatres and cinemas - reducing their potential turnover too.

Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross encourages everyone to get their booster jag and also urges those who have yet to have their first jab to come forward. He then turns to an ""unnecessary funding row"" between the Scottish and UK governments, which he describes as ""a distraction to the task in hand"". Mr Ross asks when the money will be made available to businesses. The first minister says she is not trying to cause a row over funding but believes there are ""structural problems"" to how they work. She adds theBarnett Formulais ""not fit for purpose"" Question from Joe in Perthshire There is no legal requirement to take a lateral flow test before using public transport in Scotland. However, everyone is encouraged to take one before they travel or socialise, and to take a test at leasttwice a week,external. On public transport you must by law wear a face covering, unless you are exempt, and comply with the physical distancing measures that are in place. One of the main challenges for people using trains, buses, trams and the Glasgow Subway in the coming weeks will be the cancellation of services due to staff shortages. On Monday, ScotRailcancelled 118 services- with staff illness cited as the cause of almost all of them. This was due to a combination of positive Covid cases and the 10 day self-isolation rules. This video can not be played Ms Sturgeon announces that large events - including Hogmanay events - will be banned Most of the measures announced by the first minister will be in place for three weeks after Christmas Day. Here are the main points:  Ms Sturgeon admits her statement ""feels distressingly
similar"" to the one she gave this time last year. But she says the country is in a stronger position thanks to the protection of the vaccine and adds: ""Christmas Day will be more normal."" She ends by urging everyone to get fully vaccinated as soon as possible and test regularly. The first minister also highlights the importance of other precautions such as face coverings, working from home and mixing with no more than three households. I want to end with a heartfelt thank you to everyone - for everything you have done to help us through another tough year. I wish everyone the happiest and safest Christmas possible - and a much better, brighter new year. Nicola Sturgeon, First Minister Â© 2025 BBC.

Channel migrants: Their terrifying fatal journey,"  In the freezing waters of the English Channel, a group of men, women and children are treading water and holding each other’s hands to stay afloat. Some are making desperate calls to rescuers on mobile phones held above the waves. But, as hypothermia sets in, their devices slip from their hands before they can send their location. The dinghy in which they had hoped to reach British shores has a broken motor and is deflating. One member of the group manages to send a voice message home. Just hours later, all but two of at least 30 people are dead - the worst migrant mass drowning in the Channel ever recorded. What went wrong? Here we piece together the final hours of the group - through survivors’ testimony, mobile phone messages, shipping data and the emergency response. As dusk falls, 22-year-old Hadiya Rzgar Hussein, her seven-year-old sister Hasti, brother Mubin, 16, and mum Kazhal, 46, gather their belongings together at the makeshift camp at Grande-Synthe, where they have been staying for several weeks.  They are tired and scared. French police recently dismantled the Grande-Synthe site, evicted its occupants and destroyed the family’s tent - and they are desperate to reach their relatives in the UK. To do this, they need to brave the so-called “death route” across the English Channel, paying people-smugglers to get them there on small, cheap inflatable boats. While the white cliffs of Dover are visible from some of this coastline on a clear day, the crossing is fraught with danger. It is one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes and those crossing must navigate freezing air and sea temperatures, and dangerous currents. The English Channel is one of the world’s busiest shipping routes At its shortest, it is just 21 miles (33km) across the Channel From the beaches near Dunkirk it is around 38 miles (61km) to the English coast Hadiya and her family have already tried to make it across three times before. Once they were turned back by police, once they ran out of fuel and on the third attempt the boat’s engine failed. But Hadiya’s dreams of becoming a doctor drive her and her family onwards. As evening draws in, the family are told by smugglers the time is right to leave and they join at least 28 others on board an arranged bus to Loon-Plage, a stretch of coastline between Dunkirk and Calais. The BBC has established 20 of these passengers were from Iraqi Kurdistan. The journey to the beach is short - just 10 minutes - and many on the bus begin to contact family back home to let them know they are about to leave France. Best friends Rezhwan Yasin Hassan, 19, Zanyar Mustafa Mina, 20 and Mohammed Qadir Aulla, 21, all from Iraqi Kurdistan, are among those messaging home from a shared phone.  A little later, another group of friends and acquaintances, who were also on the bus, contact their families in Iraq from several shared phones. The youngest are Pshtiwan Rasul Farka and Twana Mamand Mohammed, both 18, and 19-year-old Mohammed Hussein Mohammed. Also travelling with them are “Hybar” Bryar Hamad Abdulrahman, 23, Afrasia Ahmed Mohammed, 27, “Harem” Serkaut Perot Muhammad, 28, Shakar Ali Pirot, 30, and Hassan Mohammed Ali, 37. Among them is one Iranian, Sirwan Alipour, 23.  Bryar (pictured above, top-right) calls his mum and says he will contact her “when on the other side of the Channel”. Hadiya, the 22-year-old hoping to train as a doctor, texts her father - the man who made this trip possible. He sold the family home and borrowed money to raise the $42,000 (£32,000) needed. Iraqi Kurd “Baran” Maryam Nuri Mohamed Amin 24, trying to reach her fiance in the UK, and her friend, 32-year-old Mhabad Ahmad Ali, are also getting on the boat.  To go ahead with the launch, conditions need to be right – no police patrols, clear skies and a calm sea. At about 22:00 French time, traffickers give the migrants the final green light to cross. Some rescuers call such times “migrant weather” because it is when many decide to make the journey. But they warn it is not the wind that is the biggest challenge. It is the freezing air and sea temperatures.  A number of dinghies are dug up from their hiding places along the dunes, where they have been kept out of view of the police. At least six boats are launching that night. Hadiya and her family along with everyone else on the bus are allocated a 10m- (33-ft-) long, rubber inflatable dinghy with a motor attached at the rear. A boat like this can be bought second-hand for £400 ($531). It has no solid base and isn’t designed to safely carry more than 20 people. But this small dinghy leaves France with a human cargo of at least 32 adults and children on board. The boat pushes out into the open waters and Pshtiwan sends his last voice message home - the dinghy motor heard in the background. Overloaded, the boat makes slow progress - partly because of its excess weight - as it heads north-west into the night. Its passengers cling on to each other, and to the sides of the vessel, as the waves increase in size. Another group of migrants making the same journey just an hour later describe “big waves and stormy weather”. They are left soaking wet and freezing cold. Some are also seasick, and they end up aborting their journey and returning to France. Hadiya and her group begin to run into difficulties. As the boat reaches the middle of the Channel, its right side begins to deflate and the vessel starts taking on water. Baran messages her fiance in the UK, Karzan, on Snapchat. She describes how the boat is losing air and is taking on water, but jokes and tries to reassure him things will be fine. Those steering the boat are trying hard to keep it afloat, she says, and she is sure that the authorities will rescue them soon. Passengers begin to debate flagging down a ship they have spotted in the distance, but the consensus is they should push on to Britain. But worse is to come. A short time later, the boat’s engine cuts out, leaving the vessel and its passengers at the mercy of the Channel’s currents. The boat begins to be swallowed by the waves. As they are plunged into the freezing water, the group cling together and to what’s left of the deflated dinghy, to stop themselves drifting away from each other. They have travelled at least 30km (19 miles) from the beach where they first departed. BBC analysis of the current and ship tracking data suggests they are now near the maritime line that marks the start of British territorial waters. As they hold each other’s hands, those who can, including 16-year-old Mubin - Hadiya’s little brother - phone both the French and English authorities for help. Mid-conversation with her fiance, Baran drops off Snapchat. At least two of the group get through to the British authorities on the phone, who ask for the group’s location and tell them to keep their mobile torches on. But those passengers’ phones fall into the water before they can send the details, survivors say. Around this time, Shakar Ali Pirot sends a voice message to his family. He says if he is saved he will toss his phone into the waves - something many migrants have told the BBC they are ordered to do by smugglers to protect the people-traffickers’ identities. Some also say they do it to hide details that may prevent their asylum claims being accepted once on UK soil. Shakar’s voice message is believed to be the last known communication from the boat. According to the WhatsApp exchange between Shakar and his family, seen by the BBC, his phone stays online until 04:14 French time, but he sends no more messages. The boat is now completely submerged and all the passengers are treading water. Hypothermia sets in. He is a strong swimmer and he makes for a nearby vessel. A second migrant boat - which set off after the one carrying Hadiya and her family - arrives in the middle of the Channel. In the early morning light they see bodies in the water. The passengers of that boat call the French authorities for help. This second dinghy later arrives safely in the UK. Nearly 12 hours have passed since Hadiya and her group fell into the water. Then just before 14:00, 37-year-old French fisherman Karl Maquinghen and his crew, on board their trawler Saint Jacques II, spot 15 bodies in the water. Karl says many of the victims wearing life jackets had not connected the crotch strap correctly, which would have made it harder for them to keep their heads above water. Karl and his crew quickly raise the alarm and the nearby French navy vessel, FS Flamant - about 5km (3 miles) away - responds. The FS Flamant arrives at the scene, just inside French territorial waters A British coastguard helicopter joins the search and spots debris in the water, a few kilometres to the north-east The focus of the search shifts and by 15:45 two French coastguard vessels arrive at the new location The deflated dinghy, the rest of the dead and the two survivors are found 6km (4 miles) from where the first bodies are seen A total of 27 bodies are recovered, including those of seven women, two teenagers and one young girl. The two survivors claim the dinghy had crossed over into British waters. They say they continued to make desperate calls to both the British and French authorities, but were told by both sides to call the other. It is broadly accepted that a country has responsibility for maritime rescues in its territorial waters, although anyone finding a vessel in distress is expected to help with a rescue.  The French maritime authorities (the Maritime Prefecture of the Channel and the North Sea) say they were “not aware this boat was in difficulty prior to the alert raised by a fishing vessel”, referencing the Saint Jacques II. They add that on that same night, 106 people were saved during three different operations. However, according to the French newspaper Le Monde, a source inside the official police investigation has revealed that the itemised phone bills of the survivors confirm claims they called the French authorities for help. The UK Home Office maintains the boat was never in British territory and has rejected any claims they failed to respond to the sunken vessel. Analysis exclusive to the BBC suggests the migrant boat came close to, but never entered UK waters. Weather and water-current data from that location throughout the day suggests the boat would certainly have been pushed around, but we can deduce from the location the migrants were found in, and the direction of the currents, that waves would not have pushed them back from British waters. The BBC has confirmed at least 30 people died that night - by far the worst migrant tragedy ever recorded in the Channel. We have established, through help from many families in Iraqi Kurdistan, the identities of 20 of those on board. This includes Hadiya and her family, including her seven-year-old little sister Hasti.  There is also Baran and her friend Mhabad; best friends, Rezhwan and Mohammed Qadir, and young men Afrasia, Bilind, Bryar, Harem, Hassan, Mohammed Hussein, Muslim, Shakar and Sirwan. The body of Zanyar - Rezhwan and Mohammed’s best friend - has not yet been recovered. Pshtiwan and Twana are also still missing.   All of them were economic migrants and nearly all of them had previously tried - and failed - to get to Britain via legal routes multiple times. They had all also attempted to cross the Channel at least three, and in some cases six, times before in small boats. The French authorities told the BBC 10 other passengers who died have been identified as three Ethiopians, a woman from Somalia, four men from Afghanistan, a man from Egypt and one person from Vietnam. For Rzgar Hussein Mohammed, the pain of losing his wife and three children to the waters that night is too much to bear.  A month on, despite freezing temperatures, hundreds of migrants have continued to cross the Channel each week. Evicted from their makeshift camps by the French police in Calais, many say they have little choice but to take their chances with the Channel’s waves.

Channel migrants: Their terrifying fatal journeyAt least 29 people lost their lives last month while crossing the Channel in a dinghy. We piece together the final hours of the their journey from France.,"  In the freezing waters of the English Channel, a group of men, women and children are treading water and holding each other’s hands to stay afloat. Some are making desperate calls to rescuers on mobile phones held above the waves. But, as hypothermia sets in, their devices slip from their hands before they can send their location. The dinghy in which they had hoped to reach British shores has a broken motor and is deflating. One member of the group manages to send a voice message home. Just hours later, all but two of at least 30 people are dead - the worst migrant mass drowning in the Channel ever recorded. What went wrong? Here we piece together the final hours of the group - through survivors’ testimony, mobile phone messages, shipping data and the emergency response. As dusk falls, 22-year-old Hadiya Rzgar Hussein, her seven-year-old sister Hasti, brother Mubin, 16, and mum Kazhal, 46, gather their belongings together at the makeshift camp at Grande-Synthe, where they have been staying for several weeks.  They are tired and scared. French police recently dismantled the Grande-Synthe site, evicted its occupants and destroyed the family’s tent - and they are desperate to reach their relatives in the UK. To do this, they need to brave the so-called “death route” across the English Channel, paying people-smugglers to get them there on small, cheap inflatable boats. While the white cliffs of Dover are visible from some of this coastline on a clear day, the crossing is fraught with danger. It is one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes and those crossing must navigate freezing air and sea temperatures, and dangerous currents. The English Channel is one of the world’s busiest shipping routes At its shortest, it is just 21 miles (33km) across the Channel From the beaches near Dunkirk it is around 38 miles (61km) to the English coast Hadiya and her family have already tried to make it across three times before. Once they were turned back by police, once they ran out of fuel and on the third attempt the boat’s engine failed. But Hadiya’s dreams of becoming a doctor drive her and her family onwards. As evening draws in, the family are told by smugglers the time is right to leave and they join at least 28 others on board an arranged bus to Loon-Plage, a stretch of coastline between Dunkirk and Calais. The BBC has established 20 of these passengers were from Iraqi Kurdistan. The journey to the beach is short - just 10 minutes - and many on the bus begin to contact family back home to let them know they are about to leave France. Best friends Rezhwan Yasin Hassan, 19, Zanyar Mustafa Mina, 20 and Mohammed Qadir Aulla, 21, all from Iraqi Kurdistan, are among those messaging home from a shared phone.  A little later, another group of friends and acquaintances, who were also on the bus, contact their families in Iraq from several shared phones. The youngest are Pshtiwan Rasul Farka and Twana Mamand Mohammed, both 18, and 19-year-old Mohammed Hussein Mohammed. Also travelling with them are “Hybar” Bryar Hamad Abdulrahman, 23, Afrasia Ahmed Mohammed, 27, “Harem” Serkaut Perot Muhammad, 28, Shakar Ali Pirot, 30, and Hassan Mohammed Ali, 37. Among them is one Iranian, Sirwan Alipour, 23.  Bryar (pictured above, top-right) calls his mum and says he will contact her “when on the other side of the Channel”. Hadiya, the 22-year-old hoping to train as a doctor, texts her father - the man who made this trip possible. He sold the family home and borrowed money to raise the $42,000 (£32,000) needed. Iraqi Kurd “Baran” Maryam Nuri Mohamed Amin 24, trying to reach her fiance in the UK, and her friend, 32-year-old Mhabad Ahmad Ali, are also getting on the boat.  To go ahead with the launch, conditions need to be right – no police patrols, clear skies and a calm sea. At about 22:00 French time, traffickers give the migrants the final green light to cross. Some rescuers call such times “migrant weather” because it is when many decide to make the journey. But they warn it is not the wind that is the biggest challenge. It is the freezing air and sea temperatures.  A number of dinghies are dug up from their hiding places along the dunes, where they have been kept out of view of the police. At least six boats are launching that night. Hadiya and her family along with everyone else on the bus are allocated a 10m- (33-ft-) long, rubber inflatable dinghy with a motor attached at the rear. A boat like this can be bought second-hand for £400 ($531). It has no solid base and isn’t designed to safely carry more than 20 people. But this small dinghy leaves France with a human cargo of at least 32 adults and children on board. The boat pushes out into the open waters and Pshtiwan sends his last voice message home - the dinghy motor heard in the background. Overloaded, the boat makes slow progress - partly because of its excess weight - as it heads north-west into the night. Its passengers cling on to each other, and to the sides of the vessel, as the waves increase in size. Another group of migrants making the same journey just an hour later describe “big waves and stormy weather”. They are left soaking wet and freezing cold. Some are also seasick, and they end up aborting their journey and returning to France. Hadiya and her group begin to run into difficulties. As the boat reaches the middle of the Channel, its right side begins to deflate and the vessel starts taking on water. Baran messages her fiance in the UK, Karzan, on Snapchat. She describes how the boat is losing air and is taking on water, but jokes and tries to reassure him things will be fine. Those steering the boat are trying hard to keep it afloat, she says, and she is sure that the authorities will rescue them soon.

Sunak sets out Â£1bn fund for Covid-hit hospitality,"This video can not be played Watch Rishi Sunak discuss the government's stance on any potential Covid restrictions this Christmas Chancellor Rishi Sunak has set out a Â£1bn fund to help businesses hit by the rise in Covid cases, including the leisure and hospitality sector. Hospitality businesses like pubs and restaurants will be able to apply for cash grants of up to Â£6,000 per premises. The government would also help some firms with the cost of sick pay for Covid-related absences, Mr Sunak said. And he announced an extra Â£30m to help theatres and museums. Many hospitality and leisure firms have been hit by a collapse in bookings and reduced footfall due to people's fears over the spread of the Omicron variant. Mr Sunak said the new support was ""generous"" and recognised the situation facing businesses in the run-up to Christmas. Some industry figures have welcomed what they described as ""unprecedented"" support, but others said the measures do not go far enough. Businesses other than hospitality and leisure can apply for some of the funding. However, the chancellor would not be drawn on whether more help would come should further restrictions be announced, as ministers come under pressure to tackle the rapid rise of Omicron. No new Covid rules for England before Christmas Scotland: Hogmanay events cancelled as Covid rules tightened Mixed reaction to latest Covid package for firms Tough new ruleshave been brought in in Scotland,with a limit on the number of people allowed to attend large events and Edinburgh's Hogmanay street party being cancelled. Another 90,629 new Covid cases were reported across the UK on Tuesday - slightly down on the all-time highs announced last week. The announcement on Tuesday means: Restaurants, bars, cinemas and theatres can apply for a grant of up to Â£6,000 for each of their premises. The Treasury is setting aside Â£683m for these grants and it will be provided under existing council-run schemes Other struggling businesses outside leisure and hospitality can apply to local councils for a different grant under the Additional Restrictions Grant, which has been topped up with Â£102m The Statutory Sick Pay Rebate Schemeis being reintroduced,meaning business with fewer than 250 employees can claim money to cover sick pay for employees who are affected by Covid An extra Â£30m for arts organisations through the existing Culture Recovery Fund. Asked if more support would be offered, the chancellor said he would ""always respond proportionately and appropriately to the situation we face"". But he added that he thought the new measures announced were comparable to the grants that were on offer when businesses were fully closed earlier this year. The UK's devolved administrations are also receiving Â£154m of funding to cover all three schemes, with around Â£80m for Scotland, Â£50m for Wales and Â£25m for Northern Ireland. This money is part of a fundannounced earlier this week.,external Challenged on whether he could rule out any more restrictions before the new year, Mr Sunak said he understood people's frustrations but the UK faced a very uncertain situation over Omicron. He echoed the prime minister's comments on Monday, saying ministers were keeping the situation under review and monitoring the data ""day-by-day, hour by hour"" but ruling nothing out. However, Labour's shadow Treasury minister Pat McFadden described Mr Sunak's announcement as ""a holding package from a government caught in a holding position"". Mr McFadden said the support was ""welcome"" but that it should have been announced last week when MPs voted to pass the government's Plan B measures. In the past, government support has been extended when government policy has restricted businesses ability to trade - so this is an important recognition that consumer caution can be almost as damaging as mandatory closure. The question then is - is this it? The chancellor said that the government has always responded when necessary but he was also at pains to point out that this level of grant funding was similar in generosity to those given during lockdown. A hint perhaps that this is as good as it gets - for grant funding at least. Business groups have welcomed today's move, but are clear that plenty of hardship lies ahead in the next year when business rates bills (albeit discounted) come due and the VAT discount wears off on 1 April. The British Chambers of Commerce and others would like to see a sector specific furlough scheme if firms are forced to close their doors. Perhaps most crushing of all for business confidence is the ongoing uncertainty, and with Covid-19 that is something over which the chancellor has little control. The reaction from businesses has been mixed. Shevaun Haviland, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said the new support would provide ""welcome respite"" to many firms affected by Covid measures, but warned that more could be needed if restrictions persist or are tightened. And Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UK Hospitality, welcomed the ""unprecedented support"" announced by Mr Sunak. But Michael Kill, chief executive of the Night Time Industries Association, said ""mixed"" government messaging and further restrictions had had a ""catastrophic impact"" on nightclubs and other late-night venues over the past two weeks. He described the chancellor's support package as ""far too little"" and said it bordered ""on the insulting"" in the face of failing businesses, lost livelihoods, and a ""crippled"" industry. A pub owner from Stoke-on-Trent has said he expects to receive just under Â£2,700 in support, rather than the headline Â£6,000 - as the system is based on business rates, so larger chains will be the ones to benefit from the top end of support. Rob Ledgar told BBC Radio 4's PM programme he was around 40 to 60% down on his normal festive turnover and the funding only represents ""about seven to 10 days worth of trade over Christmas"". Meanwhile, other business owners have urged the government to provide certainty about the Covid situation, rather than handouts. Nathan Godley, from restaurant supply firm Premier Seafoods in Grimsby, Lincolnshire, said that while he did not qualify for or want government support, he wanted certainty so he could plan orders in advance and avoid losing money or stock. He told BBC Radio 4's World at One there had been a drop in orders from restaurants in the last week as people cancelled bookings and that he would have to make ""contingency plans"" to preserve and freeze the fish until it could be sold in the new year. Meanwhile, theUK's devolved nations have already announced extra measures to combatthe surge of the Omicron variant: In Scotland, from Boxing Day all outdoor events will be limited to just 500 people and the numbers at indoor events will also be cut to 200 if seated and 100 if standing. The rules will be in place for at least three weeks In Wales, spectators will be banned from all sports events from 26 December, nightclubs will close from 27 December and social distancing will return in shops and workplaces after Christmas In Northern Ireland, there is a limit of 30 on people mixing from different households in homes, face coverings are compulsory in shops and other venues and a Covid passport is needed to enter nightclubs, bars and cinemas Last week, Mr Johnson advised people to ""think carefully before you go"" out to socialise. England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty also urged people not to ""mix with people you don't have to"". Do you run a hospitality business affected by the pandemic?

Firms urge PM for clarity on Christmas Covid curbs,"Hospitality and entertainment firms are calling for a clear decision from the government on whether there will be further Covid restrictions in England in the coming days. Boris Johnson did not announce any new measures on Monday, but said data was being reviewed ""hour by hour"". Labour's London mayor Sadiq Khan warned time was running out. The chancellor met business leaders who want financial support on Monday evening, minister Stephen Barclay said. He said the government would ""say more"" about these discussions later and also urged people to have a ""cautious"" Christmas. Meanwhile, the health secretary is understood to want people with Covid to isolate for seven days, instead of 10. Sajid Javid is thought to be in favour of doing this - if clinical advice supports the change - to help ease potential staff shortages across the NHS and other organisations. Why more Omicron restrictions may cause harm What are the new Covid rules across the UK? Pubs and restaurants warn time running out to help Sunak can afford new Covid support, says think tank With just four days until Christmas, people are looking forward to spending time with loved ones after many missed out last year, when restrictions were brought in just before Christmas. BBC political correspondent Damian Grammaticas said it now seemed unlikely that new restrictions could be enacted in England before Christmas. But hospitality and entertainment businesses face critical decisions in the coming hours about whether to cancel events over the holiday period, he added. Sir Jeremy Farrar, a former member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), told BBC Radio 4's Today programme this was the most ""difficult and uncertain time"" since March 2020. Omicron's transmission was ""eye-wateringly high"", he said, adding that the variant's rapid spread was driving its impact more than its severity. Amid ongoing uncertainty about the severity of Omicron, he said it was reasonable to pause for 24 to 36 hours until that data emerges. But he said if hospitalisations were rising at that stage, the government would have to act - perhaps with more draconian measures than if they had acted a few days ago. A government spokesperson said they would continue to support businesses into spring and in the meantime people were being advised to exercise caution,follow plan B guidanceand get their booster jabs. The UK's sharp rise in UK cases is already affecting events across the country: TheNew Year's Eve celebration in London's Trafalgar Square for 6,500 key workers and members of the public is cancelledfor ""public safety"" The Queencalls off her traditional festive stay at Sandringhamand will stay at Windsor London's Natural History Museum and Edinburgh Castle temporarily close due to coronavirus-related staff shortages Almost half of London's major theatres cancel performancesthis weekend including Hamilton, Wicked and The Lion King Premier League and English Football League clubs willfulfil their festive fixturesdespite disruption as players test positive. Former government chief scientific adviser Sir Mark Walport warned that the true number of daily Covid infections was more likely to be between 300,000 and 400,000, as only about a third of cases were being identified. He told BBC Breakfast delaying any decision on restrictions was ""potentially very problematic"" as rising cases meant some hospitalisations and deaths were already ""baked into the system"". In London - which is ahead of the curve on Omicron cases - hospitalisations have risen by about a third in a week, he said. London hospital group Barts Health Trust has already written to doctors warning they may have to cancel ""some or much"" of their planned operations in January to cope with the incoming Covid surge. This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""We will have to reserve the possibility of taking further action"" After a two-hour cabinet meeting on Monday, the prime minister said the government was ""looking at all kinds of things"" to curb Omicron and ""ruled nothing out"". There were still some things ""we need to be clearer about before we decide to go further"", he added. Ministers have argued that more information about the new variant is needed to justify the economic impact of any restrictions. Leader of the House of Commons Jacob Rees-Mogg said that instead of imposing restrictions, the government should trust people to make the right decisions to protect their families, reportsthe Times,external. Tory MPs demand answers on Christmas Covid plans Scotland considering whether to cancel major events 'A fourth lockdown would be devastating' Last Christmas, large parts of south-east England werebanned from mixing with other households, while for the rest of England, Scotland and Wales, people were only allowed to mix indoors on Christmas Day. The World Health Organization (WHO) hasurged people to cancel some of their holiday plansas the Omicron variant spreads globally. ""An event cancelled is better than a life cancelled,"" said WHO head Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. On Monday, a further 91,743 Covid cases were reported across the UK - the second highest daily total on record. High cases mean many people are off work and self-isolating - while others have cancelled bookings or events to try to avoid becoming infected in the run-up to Christmas, hitting businesses hard. Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UK Hospitality which represents more than 700 bars, hotels and leisure venues, said some had lost about half of their usual December trade.

Sunak sets out Â£1bn fund for Covid-hit hospitalityIt comes as pubs and restaurants struggle with reduced footfall and cancellations amid Covid fears.UK,"This video can not be played Watch Rishi Sunak discuss the government's stance on any potential Covid restrictions this Christmas Chancellor Rishi Sunak has set out a Â£1bn fund to help businesses hit by the rise in Covid cases, including the leisure and hospitality sector. Hospitality businesses like pubs and restaurants will be able to apply for cash grants of up to Â£6,000 per premises. The government would also help some firms with the cost of sick pay for Covid-related absences, Mr Sunak said. And he announced an extra Â£30m to help theatres and museums. Many hospitality and leisure firms have been hit by a collapse in bookings and reduced footfall due to people's fears over the spread of the Omicron variant. Mr Sunak said the new support was ""generous"" and recognised the situation facing businesses in the run-up to Christmas. Some industry figures have welcomed what they described as ""unprecedented"" support, but others said the measures do not go far enough. Businesses other than hospitality and leisure can apply for some of the funding. However, the chancellor would not be drawn on whether more help would come should further restrictions be announced, as ministers come under pressure to tackle the rapid rise of Omicron. No new Covid rules for England before Christmas Scotland: Hogmanay events cancelled as Covid rules tightened Mixed reaction to latest Covid package for firms Tough new ruleshave been brought in in Scotland,with a limit on the number of people allowed to attend large events and Edinburgh's Hogmanay street party being cancelled. Another 90,629 new Covid cases were reported across the UK on Tuesday - slightly down on the all-time highs announced last week. The announcement on Tuesday means: Restaurants, bars, cinemas and theatres can apply for a grant of up to Â£6,000 for each of their premises. The Treasury is setting aside Â£683m for these grants and it will be provided under existing council-run schemes Other struggling businesses outside leisure and hospitality can apply to local councils for a different grant under the Additional Restrictions Grant, which has been topped up with Â£102m The Statutory Sick Pay Rebate Schemeis being reintroduced,meaning business with fewer than 250 employees can claim money to cover sick pay for employees who are affected by Covid An extra Â£30m for arts organisations through the existing Culture Recovery Fund. Asked if more support would be offered, the chancellor said he would ""always respond proportionately and appropriately to the situation we face"". But he added that he thought the new measures announced were comparable to the grants that were on offer when businesses were fully closed earlier this year. The UK's devolved administrations are also receiving Â£154m of funding to cover all three schemes, with around Â£80m for Scotland, Â£50m for Wales and Â£25m for Northern Ireland. This money is part of a fundannounced earlier this week.,external Challenged on whether he could rule out any more restrictions before the new year, Mr Sunak said he understood people's frustrations but the UK faced a very uncertain situation over Omicron. He echoed the prime minister's comments on Monday, saying ministers were keeping the situation under review and monitoring the data ""day-by-day, hour by hour"" but ruling nothing out. However, Labour's shadow Treasury minister Pat McFadden described Mr Sunak's announcement as ""a holding package from a government caught in a holding position"". Mr McFadden said the support was ""welcome"" but that it should have been announced last week when MPs voted to pass the government's Plan B measures. In the past, government support has been extended when government policy has restricted businesses ability to trade - so this is an important recognition that consumer caution can be almost as damaging as mandatory closure. The question then is - is this it? The chancellor said that the government has always responded when necessary but he was also at pains to point out that this level of grant funding was similar in generosity to those given during lockdown. A hint perhaps that this is as good as it gets - for grant funding at least. Business groups have welcomed today's move, but are clear that plenty of hardship lies ahead in the next year when business rates bills (albeit discounted) come due and the VAT discount wears off on 1 April. The British Chambers of Commerce and others would like to see a sector specific furlough scheme if firms are forced to close their doors. Perhaps most crushing of all for business confidence is the ongoing uncertainty, and with Covid-19 that is something over which the chancellor has little control. The reaction from businesses has been mixed. Shevaun Haviland, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said the new support would provide ""welcome respite"" to many firms affected by Covid measures, but warned that more could be needed if restrictions persist or are tightened. And Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UK Hospitality, welcomed the ""unprecedented support"" announced by Mr Sunak. But Michael Kill, chief executive of the Night Time Industries Association, said ""mixed"" government messaging and further restrictions had had a ""catastrophic impact"" on nightclubs and other late-night venues over the past two weeks. He described the chancellor's support package as ""far too little"" and said it bordered ""on the insulting"" in the face of failing businesses, lost livelihoods, and a ""crippled"" industry. A pub owner from Stoke-on-Trent has said he expects to receive just under Â£2,700 in support, rather than the headline Â£6,000 - as the system is based on business rates, so larger chains will be the ones to benefit from the top end of support. Rob Ledgar told BBC Radio 4's PM programme he was around 40 to 60% down on his normal festive turnover and the funding only represents ""about seven to 10 days worth of trade over Christmas"". Meanwhile, other business owners have urged the government to provide certainty about the Covid situation, rather than handouts. Nathan Godley, from restaurant supply firm Premier Seafoods in Grimsby, Lincolnshire, said that while he did not qualify for or want government support, he wanted certainty so he could plan orders in advance and avoid losing money or stock. He told BBC Radio 4's World at One there had been a drop in orders from restaurants in the last week as people cancelled bookings and that he would have to make ""contingency plans"" to preserve and freeze the fish until it could be sold in the new year. Meanwhile, theUK's devolved nations have already announced extra measures to combatthe surge of the Omicron variant: In Scotland, from Boxing Day all outdoor events will be limited to just 500 people and the numbers at indoor events will also be cut to 200 if seated and 100 if standing. The rules will be in place for at least three weeks In Wales, spectators will be banned from all sports events from 26 December, nightclubs will close from 27 December and social distancing will return in shops and workplaces after Christmas In Northern Ireland, there is a limit of 30 on people mixing from different households in homes, face coverings are compulsory in shops and other venues and a Covid passport is needed to enter nightclubs, bars and cinemas Last week, Mr Johnson advised people to ""think carefully before you go"" out to socialise. England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty also urged people not to ""mix with people you don't have to"". Do you run a hospitality business affected by the pandemic?

All sports events in Wales go behind closed doors,"More restrictions in Wales could be announced on Wednesday Wales will need more restrictions to keep the country safe, a senior Welsh government minister has said. Ministers will announce on Wednesday their plans for the post-Christmas period. Economy Minister Vaughan Gething said limits on household mixing were part of the Welsh government's discussions. It comes as spectators are banned from all indoor, outdoor, professional and community sports events in Wales from 26 December. Mr Gething said a Â£3m Spectator Sports Fund will be available to support clubs and venues. He said he expected ""several thousand"" identified Omicron cases in Wales by Boxing Day, with the real number being much higher. The number of Omicron cases identified in Wales rose by 204 on Tuesday to 640. Last week the Welsh government decided to shut nightclubs, and reintroduce social distancing in workplaces, from 27 December. Its cabinet met on Tuesday to discuss what happens next, including possible post-Christmas hospitality restrictions. Drakeford denies rules 'gambling' with livelihoods Nightclubs and restaurants fear New Year losses The Senedd will be recalled on Wednesday following a request from Welsh Conservative Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies. He said it was essential further changes were debated in the Senedd beforehand. ""The drip, drip effect of releasing restrictions by press release risks undermining public confidence at such an important time of the year for families and businesses,"" he said. ""Imposing restrictions on society must be done on the strongest possible evidence, and fully communicated to the Welsh public in the form we have become accustomed to during the pandemic - not released via press release at midnight."" The 2020 Welsh Grand National took place behind closed doors Plaid Cymru's sports spokeswoman Heledd Fychan said it was important sports clubs were supported. ""Our sports thrive with public support, and it's a cruel twist that so coronavirus thrives in crowds as well,"" she added. Out on the main shopping street in Treorchy, Rhondda Cynon Taf, there was a feeling of uncertainty about what's ahead. Rachel Evans, 50, said she was hoping her Boxing Day party with her two brothers and their families will still go ahead but she is prepared for the worst. ""It may have to be cancelled like it was last year. We did an online quiz then between us all. ""But we've seen a lot of footfall in Treorchy over the last few days, people worrying about what's going to happen. The shops are really busy at the minute."" Her daughter, Carys Evans, 19, has plans to go out with friends on New Year's Eve. ""Who knows now, I probably won't,"" she said. ""It's a bit gutting because especially last year when we couldn't go out. It's another year of it, another year of nothing really."" The former health minister Mr Gething said more protections ""are likely to be introduced from the 27th onwards"". He called for the UK government to return to furlough ""because I'm confident that more protective measures will be needed to keep people safe and alive and well"". Speaking to BBC Wales Today, Mr Gething said limits on household mixing will ""definitely need to be part of the discussion"" on any further restrictions. He admitted there were consequences from many restrictions but said: ""The danger is we wait and we wait and we wait before we act and by then when the evidence is crystal in terms of numbers and percentages it is too late to act."" The Cardiff v Scarlets Boxing Day match at Cardiff Arms Park was set to be a sell-out Events affected by the decision to shut sports to spectators include the Cardiff versus Scarlets rugby match at Cardiff Arms Park on 26 December, and the Welsh Grand National in Chepstow the following day. The move comes a few weeks ahead of big international fixtures, with the first of three Six Nations home games on 12 February against Scotland, while the men's football team play Austria in a crucial World Cup play-off in Cardiff on 24 March. Scarlets boss Phil Morgan said the news is ""another significant financial blow to the business"", but health and safety will ""always be our utmost priority"". TheOspreys versus Dragons matchhad already been called off because of a Covid outbreak, as had football matches involving Cardiff City and Newport County. The Welsh government said restrictions would be reviewed regularly, adding: ""Crowds will come back as soon as possible. We want everyone to be here to enjoy their favourite sports."" On these new restrictions, Mr Gething said: ""We need to do everything we can to protect people's health and control the spread of this awful virus."" The Welsh government said further details about the Â£3m support package would be made available following discussions with the sector. It added that a sporting event referred to all indoor and outdoor sporting events, whether ticketed or not, with spectators. It said this included larger sporting events and those at every level, including community level, which attract significantly smaller crowds. Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford has warned of further restrictions amid rising Omicron cases The overall rate of coronavirus infections is also rising in Wales, standing at 575 per 100,000 people. It has the lowest case rate of the nations. In hospitals, a total of 87.6% of acute hospital beds are occupied, slightly down on two weeks ago. The number of Covid patients on invasive ventilation or in critical care beds stands at 30, the lowest number seen since 23 August. There are more than four times the number of non-Covid patients in critical care. First Minister Mark Drakeford has warned of ""a gathering storm"" of Omicron infections after the Christmas period and has already announced that nightclubs will shut down at midnight on Boxing Day. He also said it was ""inevitable"" there would be further restrictions for pubs and restaurants after Christmas. The Welsh government said the new sports restrictions would be ""reviewed regularly"". Speaking toRadio Wales Breakfast, Prof Lawrence Young, a virologist at the University of Warwick, called for clarity on gatherings over Christmas, adding there were concerns over waiting while the virus continues to double every two days. ""The longer we leave it, the worse this is going to get. Waiting for more hospitalisations to increase before you make a move could be too little too late,"" he said. He added that the World Health Organization had advised ""it is better to cancel events than cancel lives"". ""We need to have more time to get jabs into arms. We know that the vaccine programme is going really well, but it's a very, very stretched target to get all adults boosted by the end of December."" Darren Hughes, director of the Welsh NHS Confederation, added it was not only the number of patients with Omicron that could put pressure on hospitals, but also the number of staff absences. ""It is starting to have a real serious impactâ¦ this isn't just down to government this is down to us as individuals to do all we can to protect ourselves and the family,"" he said.

Firms urge PM for clarity on Christmas Covid curbsThe hospitality sector is calling for a clear decision on whether to expect new restrictions in England.,"Hospitality and entertainment firms are calling for a clear decision from the government on whether there will be further Covid restrictions in England in the coming days. Boris Johnson did not announce any new measures on Monday, but said data was being reviewed ""hour by hour"". Labour's London mayor Sadiq Khan warned time was running out. The chancellor met business leaders who want financial support on Monday evening, minister Stephen Barclay said. He said the government would ""say more"" about these discussions later and also urged people to have a ""cautious"" Christmas. Meanwhile, the health secretary is understood to want people with Covid to isolate for seven days, instead of 10. Sajid Javid is thought to be in favour of doing this - if clinical advice supports the change - to help ease potential staff shortages across the NHS and other organisations. Why more Omicron restrictions may cause harm What are the new Covid rules across the UK? Pubs and restaurants warn time running out to help Sunak can afford new Covid support, says think tank With just four days until Christmas, people are looking forward to spending time with loved ones after many missed out last year, when restrictions were brought in just before Christmas. BBC political correspondent Damian Grammaticas said it now seemed unlikely that new restrictions could be enacted in England before Christmas. But hospitality and entertainment businesses face critical decisions in the coming hours about whether to cancel events over the holiday period, he added. Sir Jeremy Farrar, a former member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), told BBC Radio 4's Today programme this was the most ""difficult and uncertain time"" since March 2020. Omicron's transmission was ""eye-wateringly high"", he said, adding that the variant's rapid spread was driving its impact more than its severity. Amid ongoing uncertainty about the severity of Omicron, he said it was reasonable to pause for 24 to 36 hours until that data emerges. But he said if hospitalisations were rising at that stage, the government would have to act - perhaps with more draconian measures than if they had acted a few days ago. A government spokesperson said they would continue to support businesses into spring and in the meantime people were being advised to exercise caution,follow plan B guidanceand get their booster jabs. The UK's sharp rise in UK cases is already affecting events across the country: TheNew Year's Eve celebration in London's Trafalgar Square for 6,500 key workers and members of the public is cancelledfor ""public safety"" The Queencalls off her traditional festive stay at Sandringhamand will stay at Windsor London's Natural History Museum and Edinburgh Castle temporarily close due to coronavirus-related staff shortages Almost half of London's major theatres cancel performancesthis weekend including Hamilton, Wicked and The Lion King Premier League and English Football League clubs willfulfil their festive fixturesdespite disruption as players test positive. Former government chief scientific adviser Sir Mark Walport warned that the true number of daily Covid infections was more likely to be between 300,000 and 400,000, as only about a third of cases were being identified. He told BBC Breakfast delaying any decision on restrictions was ""potentially very problematic"" as rising cases meant some hospitalisations and deaths were already ""baked into the system"". In London - which is ahead of the curve on Omicron cases - hospitalisations have risen by about a third in a week, he said. London hospital group Barts Health Trust has already written to doctors warning they may have to cancel ""some or much"" of their planned operations in January to cope with the incoming Covid surge. This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""We will have to reserve the possibility of taking further action"" After a two-hour cabinet meeting on Monday, the prime minister said the government was ""looking at all kinds of things"" to curb Omicron and ""ruled nothing out"". There were still some things ""we need to be clearer about before we decide to go further"", he added. Ministers have argued that more information about the new variant is needed to justify the economic impact of any restrictions. Leader of the House of Commons Jacob Rees-Mogg said that instead of imposing restrictions, the government should trust people to make the right decisions to protect their families, reportsthe Times,external. Tory MPs demand answers on Christmas Covid plans Scotland considering whether to cancel major events 'A fourth lockdown would be devastating' Last Christmas, large parts of south-east England werebanned from mixing with other households, while for the rest of England, Scotland and Wales, people were only allowed to mix indoors on Christmas Day. The World Health Organization (WHO) hasurged people to cancel some of their holiday plansas the Omicron variant spreads globally. ""An event cancelled is better than a life cancelled,"" said WHO head Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. On Monday, a further 91,743 Covid cases were reported across the UK - the second highest daily total on record. High cases mean many people are off work and self-isolating - while others have cancelled bookings or events to try to avoid becoming infected in the run-up to Christmas, hitting businesses hard. Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UK Hospitality which represents more than 700 bars, hotels and leisure venues, said some had lost about half of their usual December trade. She said businesses were now ""in limbo"" and needed notice of any changes looked at next week ahead of the New Year.

In London - which is ahead of the curve on Omicron cases - hospitalisations have risen by about a third in a week, he said. London hospital group Barts Health Trust has already written to doctors warning they may have to cancel ""some or much"" of their planned operations in January to cope with the incoming Covid surge. This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""We will have to reserve the possibility of taking further action"" After a two-hour cabinet meeting on Monday, the prime minister said the government was ""looking at all kinds of things"" to curb Omicron and ""ruled nothing out"". There were still some things ""we need to be clearer about before we decide to go further"", he added. Ministers have argued that more information about the new variant is needed to justify the economic impact of any restrictions. Leader of the House of Commons Jacob Rees-Mogg said that instead of imposing restrictions, the government should trust people to make the right decisions to protect their families, reportsthe Times,external. Tory MPs demand answers on Christmas Covid plans Scotland considering whether to cancel major events 'A fourth lockdown would be devastating' Last Christmas, large parts of south-east England werebanned from mixing with other households, while for the rest of England, Scotland and Wales, people were only allowed to mix indoors on Christmas Day. The World Health Organization (WHO) hasurged people to cancel some of their holiday plansas the Omicron variant spreads globally. ""An event cancelled is better than a life cancelled,"" said WHO head Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. On Monday, a further 91,743 Covid cases were reported across the UK - the second highest daily total on record. High cases mean many people are off work and self-isolating - while others have cancelled bookings or events to try to avoid becoming infected in the run-up to Christmas, hitting businesses hard. Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UK Hospitality which represents more than 700 bars, hotels and leisure venues, said some had lost about half of their usual December trade. She said businesses were now ""in limbo"" and needed notice of any changes looked at next week ahead of the New Year. Labour has called for the government to publish its contingency plan to deal with Covid-related staff shortages in essential services. The party's deputy leader Angela Rayner said ""dithering and delay"" had caused disruption throughout the pandemic, and Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said the PM was giving chaos and confusion when clarity and reassurance was needed. Without early interventions the UK would see a wave of infections over the next few months, according to Sage scientist Prof Andrew Hayward, which could lead to staffing problems becoming ""much, much more severe"" and make essential services ""difficult to manage"". This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon says she wants ""people to have clarity about what we are expecting of them"" ahead of Christmas Day The UK's devolved nations have been setting their own Covid guidelines ahead of Christmas. InScotland, people have been advised to reduce their contacts as much as possible, but have not been asked to cancel Christmas plans. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon saidthis advice would not change InWales,spectators will be banned from all sports eventsfrom 26 December and ministers will meet later to discuss post-Christmas hospitality restrictions InNorthern Ireland, the executive will meet on Wednesdayto discuss current restrictions, which include a limit of 30 people from different households mixing in homes. Leaked notes fromSage suggest that,without intervention beyond current Plan B rules in England, hospital admissions could reach 3,000 a day. And the BBC has been told that civil servants have produced three options for future Covid measures, ranging in severity from low to medium and high.

The Channel migrants' terrifying journey,"  In the freezing waters of the English Channel, a group of men, women and children are treading water and holding each other’s hands to stay afloat. Some are making desperate calls to rescuers on mobile phones held above the waves. But, as hypothermia sets in, their devices slip from their hands before they can send their location. The dinghy in which they had hoped to reach British shores has a broken motor and is deflating. One member of the group manages to send a voice message home. Just hours later, all but two of at least 30 people are dead - the worst migrant mass drowning in the Channel ever recorded. What went wrong? Here we piece together the final hours of the group - through survivors’ testimony, mobile phone messages, shipping data and the emergency response. As dusk falls, 22-year-old Hadiya Rzgar Hussein, her seven-year-old sister Hasti, brother Mubin, 16, and mum Kazhal, 46, gather their belongings together at the makeshift camp at Grande-Synthe, where they have been staying for several weeks.  They are tired and scared. French police recently dismantled the Grande-Synthe site, evicted its occupants and destroyed the family’s tent - and they are desperate to reach their relatives in the UK. To do this, they need to brave the so-called “death route” across the English Channel, paying people-smugglers to get them there on small, cheap inflatable boats. While the white cliffs of Dover are visible from some of this coastline on a clear day, the crossing is fraught with danger. It is one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes and those crossing must navigate freezing air and sea temperatures, and dangerous currents. The English Channel is one of the world’s busiest shipping routes At its shortest, it is just 21 miles (33km) across the Channel From the beaches near Dunkirk it is around 38 miles (61km) to the English coast Hadiya and her family have already tried to make it across three times before. Once they were turned back by police, once they ran out of fuel and on the third attempt the boat’s engine failed. But Hadiya’s dreams of becoming a doctor drive her and her family onwards. As evening draws in, the family are told by smugglers the time is right to leave and they join at least 28 others on board an arranged bus to Loon-Plage, a stretch of coastline between Dunkirk and Calais. The BBC has established 20 of these passengers were from Iraqi Kurdistan. The journey to the beach is short - just 10 minutes - and many on the bus begin to contact family back home to let them know they are about to leave France. Best friends Rezhwan Yasin Hassan, 19, Zanyar Mustafa Mina, 20 and Mohammed Qadir Aulla, 21, all from Iraqi Kurdistan, are among those messaging home from a shared phone.  A little later, another group of friends and acquaintances, who were also on the bus, contact their families in Iraq from several shared phones. The youngest are Pshtiwan Rasul Farka and Twana Mamand Mohammed, both 18, and 19-year-old Mohammed Hussein Mohammed. Also travelling with them are “Hybar” Bryar Hamad Abdulrahman, 23, Afrasia Ahmed Mohammed, 27, “Harem” Serkaut Perot Muhammad, 28, Shakar Ali Pirot, 30, and Hassan Mohammed Ali, 37. Among them is one Iranian, Sirwan Alipour, 23.  Bryar (pictured above, top-right) calls his mum and says he will contact her “when on the other side of the Channel”. Hadiya, the 22-year-old hoping to train as a doctor, texts her father - the man who made this trip possible. He sold the family home and borrowed money to raise the $42,000 (£32,000) needed. Iraqi Kurd “Baran” Maryam Nuri Mohamed Amin 24, trying to reach her fiance in the UK, and her friend, 32-year-old Mhabad Ahmad Ali, are also getting on the boat.  To go ahead with the launch, conditions need to be right – no police patrols, clear skies and a calm sea. At about 22:00 French time, traffickers give the migrants the final green light to cross. Some rescuers call such times “migrant weather” because it is when many decide to make the journey. But they warn it is not the wind that is the biggest challenge. It is the freezing air and sea temperatures.  A number of dinghies are dug up from their hiding places along the dunes, where they have been kept out of view of the police. At least six boats are launching that night. Hadiya and her family along with everyone else on the bus are allocated a 10m- (33-ft-) long, rubber inflatable dinghy with a motor attached at the rear. A boat like this can be bought second-hand for £400 ($531). It has no solid base and isn’t designed to safely carry more than 20 people. But this small dinghy leaves France with a human cargo of at least 32 adults and children on board. The boat pushes out into the open waters and Pshtiwan sends his last voice message home - the dinghy motor heard in the background. Overloaded, the boat makes slow progress - partly because of its excess weight - as it heads north-west into the night. Its passengers cling on to each other, and to the sides of the vessel, as the waves increase in size. Another group of migrants making the same journey just an hour later describe “big waves and stormy weather”. They are left soaking wet and freezing cold. Some are also seasick, and they end up aborting their journey and returning to France. Hadiya and her group begin to run into difficulties. As the boat reaches the middle of the Channel, its right side begins to deflate and the vessel starts taking on water. Baran messages her fiance in the UK, Karzan, on Snapchat. She describes how the boat is losing air and is taking on water, but jokes and tries to reassure him things will be fine. Those steering the boat are trying hard to keep it afloat, she says, and she is sure that the authorities will rescue them soon. Passengers begin to debate flagging down a ship they have spotted in the distance, but the consensus is they should push on to Britain. But worse is to come. A short time later, the boat’s engine cuts out, leaving the vessel and its passengers at the mercy of the Channel’s currents. The boat begins to be swallowed by the waves. As they are plunged into the freezing water, the group cling together and to what’s left of the deflated dinghy, to stop themselves drifting away from each other. They have travelled at least 30km (19 miles) from the beach where they first departed. BBC analysis of the current and ship tracking data suggests they are now near the maritime line that marks the start of British territorial waters. As they hold each other’s hands, those who can, including 16-year-old Mubin - Hadiya’s little brother - phone both the French and English authorities for help. Mid-conversation with her fiance, Baran drops off Snapchat. At least two of the group get through to the British authorities on the phone, who ask for the group’s location and tell them to keep their mobile torches on. But those passengers’ phones fall into the water before they can send the details, survivors say. Around this time, Shakar Ali Pirot sends a voice message to his family. He says if he is saved he will toss his phone into the waves - something many migrants have told the BBC they are ordered to do by smugglers to protect the people-traffickers’ identities. Some also say they do it to hide details that may prevent their asylum claims being accepted once on UK soil. Shakar’s voice message is believed to be the last known communication from the boat. According to the WhatsApp exchange between Shakar and his family, seen by the BBC, his phone stays online until 04:14 French time, but he sends no more messages. The boat is now completely submerged and all the passengers are treading water. Hypothermia sets in. He is a strong swimmer and he makes for a nearby vessel. A second migrant boat - which set off after the one carrying Hadiya and her family - arrives in the middle of the Channel. In the early morning light they see bodies in the water. The passengers of that boat call the French authorities for help. This second dinghy later arrives safely in the UK. Nearly 12 hours have passed since Hadiya and her group fell into the water. Then just before 14:00, 37-year-old French fisherman Karl Maquinghen and his crew, on board their trawler Saint Jacques II, spot 15 bodies in the water. Karl says many of the victims wearing life jackets had not connected the crotch strap correctly, which would have made it harder for them to keep their heads above water. Karl and his crew quickly raise the alarm and the nearby French navy vessel, FS Flamant - about 5km (3 miles) away - responds. The FS Flamant arrives at the scene, just inside French territorial waters A British coastguard helicopter joins the search and spots debris in the water, a few kilometres to the north-east The focus of the search shifts and by 15:45 two French coastguard vessels arrive at the new location The deflated dinghy, the rest of the dead and the two survivors are found 6km (4 miles) from where the first bodies are seen A total of 27 bodies are recovered, including those of seven women, two teenagers and one young girl. The two survivors claim the dinghy had crossed over into British waters. They say they continued to make desperate calls to both the British and French authorities, but were told by both sides to call the other. It is broadly accepted that a country has responsibility for maritime rescues in its territorial waters, although anyone finding a vessel in distress is expected to help with a rescue.  The French maritime authorities (the Maritime Prefecture of the Channel and the North Sea) say they were “not aware this boat was in difficulty prior to the alert raised by a fishing vessel”, referencing the Saint Jacques II. They add that on that same night, 106 people were saved during three different operations. However, according to the French newspaper Le Monde, a source inside the official police investigation has revealed that the itemised phone bills of the survivors confirm claims they called the French authorities for help. The UK Home Office maintains the boat was never in British territory and has rejected any claims they failed to respond to the sunken vessel. Analysis exclusive to the BBC suggests the migrant boat came close to, but never entered UK waters. Weather and water-current data from that location throughout the day suggests the boat would certainly have been pushed around, but we can deduce from the location the migrants were found in, and the direction of the currents, that waves would not have pushed them back from British waters. The BBC has confirmed at least 30 people died that night - by far the worst migrant tragedy ever recorded in the Channel. We have established, through help from many families in Iraqi Kurdistan, the identities of 20 of those on board. This includes Hadiya and her family, including her seven-year-old little sister Hasti.  There is also Baran and her friend Mhabad; best friends, Rezhwan and Mohammed Qadir, and young men Afrasia, Bilind, Bryar, Harem, Hassan, Mohammed Hussein, Muslim, Shakar and Sirwan. The body of Zanyar - Rezhwan and Mohammed’s best friend - has not yet been recovered. Pshtiwan and Twana are also still missing.   All of them were economic migrants and nearly all of them had previously tried - and failed - to get to Britain via legal routes multiple times. They had all also attempted to cross the Channel at least three, and in some cases six, times before in small boats. The French authorities told the BBC 10 other passengers who died have been identified as three Ethiopians, a woman from Somalia, four men from Afghanistan, a man from Egypt and one person from Vietnam. For Rzgar Hussein Mohammed, the pain of losing his wife and three children to the waters that night is too much to bear.  A month on, despite freezing temperatures, hundreds of migrants have continued to cross the Channel each week. Evicted from their makeshift camps by the French police in Calais, many say they have little choice but to take their chances with the Channel’s waves.

Channel migrants tragedy: The final hours of their terrifying journeyAt least 29 people lost their lives last month while crossing the Channel in a dinghy. We piece together the final hours of the their journey from France.,"  In the freezing waters of the English Channel, a group of men, women and children are treading water and holding each other’s hands to stay afloat.

The journey to the beach is short - just 10 minutes - and many on the bus begin to contact family back home to let them know they are about to leave France. Best friends Rezhwan Yasin Hassan, 19, Zanyar Mustafa Mina, 20 and Mohammed Qadir Aulla, 21, all from Iraqi Kurdistan, are among those messaging home from a shared phone.  A little later, another group of friends and acquaintances, who were also on the bus, contact their families in Iraq from several shared phones. The youngest are Pshtiwan Rasul Farka and Twana Mamand Mohammed, both 18, and 19-year-old Mohammed Hussein Mohammed. Also travelling with them are “Hybar” Bryar Hamad Abdulrahman, 23, Afrasia Ahmed Mohammed, 27, “Harem” Serkaut Perot Muhammad, 28, Shakar Ali Pirot, 30, and Hassan Mohammed Ali, 37. Among them is one Iranian, Sirwan Alipour, 23.  Bryar (pictured above, top-right) calls his mum and says he will contact her “when on the other side of the Channel”. Hadiya, the 22-year-old hoping to train as a doctor, texts her father - the man who made this trip possible. He sold the family home and borrowed money to raise the $42,000 (£32,000) needed. Iraqi Kurd “Baran” Maryam Nuri Mohamed Amin 24, trying to reach her fiance in the UK, and her friend, 32-year-old Mhabad Ahmad Ali, are also getting on the boat.  To go ahead with the launch, conditions need to be right – no police patrols, clear skies and a calm sea. At about 22:00 French time, traffickers give the migrants the final green light to cross. Some rescuers call such times “migrant weather” because it is when many decide to make the journey. But they warn it is not the wind that is the biggest challenge. It is the freezing air and sea temperatures.  A number of dinghies are dug up from their hiding places along the dunes, where they have been kept out of view of the police. At least six boats are launching that night. Hadiya and her family along with everyone else on the bus are allocated a 10m- (33-ft-) long, rubber inflatable dinghy with a motor attached at the rear. A boat like this can be bought second-hand for £400 ($531). It has no solid base and isn’t designed to safely carry more than 20 people. But this small dinghy leaves France with a human cargo of at least 32 adults and children on board. The boat pushes out into the open waters and Pshtiwan sends his last voice message home - the dinghy motor heard in the background. Overloaded, the boat makes slow progress - partly because of its excess weight - as it heads north-west into the night. Its passengers cling on to each other, and to the sides of the vessel, as the waves increase in size. Another group of migrants making the same journey just an hour later describe “big waves and stormy weather”. They are left soaking wet and freezing cold. Some are also seasick, and they end up aborting their journey and returning to France. Hadiya and her group begin to run into difficulties. As the boat reaches the middle of the Channel, its right side begins to deflate and the vessel starts taking on water. Baran messages her fiance in the UK, Karzan, on Snapchat. She describes how the boat is losing air and is taking on water, but jokes and tries to reassure him things will be fine. Those steering the boat are trying hard to keep it afloat, she says, and she is sure that the authorities will rescue them soon. Passengers begin to debate flagging down a ship they have spotted in the distance, but the consensus is they should push on to Britain. But worse is to come. A short time later, the boat’s engine cuts out, leaving the vessel and its passengers at the mercy of the Channel’s currents. The boat begins to be swallowed by the waves. As they are plunged into the freezing water, the group cling together and to what’s left of the deflated dinghy, to stop themselves drifting away from each other. They have travelled at least 30km (19 miles) from the beach where they first departed. BBC analysis of the current and ship tracking data suggests they are now near the maritime line that marks the start of British territorial waters. As they hold each other’s hands, those who can, including 16-year-old Mubin - Hadiya’s little brother - phone both the French and English authorities for help. Mid-conversation with her fiance, Baran drops off Snapchat. At least two of the group get through to the British authorities on the phone, who ask for the group’s location and tell them to keep their mobile torches on. But those passengers’ phones fall into the water before they can send the details, survivors say. Around this time, Shakar Ali Pirot sends a voice message to his family. He says if he is saved he will toss his phone into the waves - something many migrants have told the BBC they are ordered to do by smugglers to protect the people-traffickers’ identities. Some also say they do it to hide details that may prevent their asylum claims being accepted once on UK soil. Shakar’s voice message is believed to be the last known communication from the boat. According to the WhatsApp exchange between Shakar and his family, seen by the BBC, his phone stays online until 04:14 French time, but he sends no more messages. The boat is now completely submerged and all the passengers are treading water. Hypothermia sets in. He is a strong swimmer and he makes for a nearby vessel. A second migrant boat - which set off after the one carrying Hadiya and her family - arrives in the middle of the Channel. In the early morning light they see bodies in the water. The passengers of that boat call the French authorities for help. This second dinghy later arrives safely in the UK. Nearly 12 hours have passed since Hadiya and her group fell into the water. Then just before 14:00, 37-year-old French fisherman Karl Maquinghen and his crew, on board their trawler Saint Jacques II, spot 15 bodies in the water. Karl says many of the victims wearing life jackets had not connected the crotch strap correctly, which would have made it harder for them to keep their heads above water. Karl and his crew quickly raise the alarm and the nearby French navy vessel, FS Flamant - about 5km (3 miles) away - responds. The FS Flamant arrives at the scene, just inside French territorial waters A British coastguard helicopter joins the search and spots debris in the water, a few kilometres to the north-east The focus of the search shifts and by 15:45 two French coastguard vessels arrive at the new location The deflated dinghy, the rest of the dead and the two survivors are found 6km (4 miles) from where the first bodies are seen A total of 27 bodies are recovered, including those of seven women, two teenagers and one young girl. The two survivors claim the dinghy had crossed over into British waters. They say they continued to make desperate calls to both the British and French authorities, but were told by both sides to call the other. It is broadly accepted that a country has responsibility for maritime rescues in its territorial waters, although anyone finding a vessel in distress is expected to help with a rescue.  The French maritime authorities (the Maritime Prefecture of the Channel and the North Sea) say they were “not aware this boat was in difficulty prior to the alert raised by a fishing vessel”, referencing the Saint Jacques II. They add that on that same night, 106 people were saved during three different operations. However, according to the French newspaper Le Monde, a source inside the official police investigation has revealed that the itemised phone bills of the survivors confirm claims they called the French authorities for help. The UK Home Office maintains the boat was never in British territory and has rejected any claims they failed to respond to the sunken vessel. Analysis exclusive to the BBC suggests the migrant boat came close to, but never entered UK waters. Weather and water-current data from that location throughout the day suggests the boat would certainly have been pushed around, but we can deduce from the location the migrants were found in, and the direction of the currents, that waves would not have pushed them back from British waters. The BBC has confirmed at least 30 people died that night - by far the worst migrant tragedy ever recorded in the Channel. We have established, through help from many families in Iraqi Kurdistan, the identities of 20 of those on board. This includes Hadiya and her family, including her seven-year-old little sister Hasti.  There is also Baran and her friend Mhabad; best friends, Rezhwan and Mohammed Qadir, and young men Afrasia, Bilind, Bryar, Harem, Hassan, Mohammed Hussein, Muslim, Shakar and Sirwan. The body of Zanyar - Rezhwan and Mohammed’s best friend - has not yet been recovered. Pshtiwan and Twana are also still missing.   All of them were economic migrants and nearly all of them had previously tried - and failed - to get to Britain via legal routes multiple times. They had all also attempted to cross the Channel at least three, and in some cases six, times before in small boats. The French authorities told the BBC 10 other passengers who died have been identified as three Ethiopians, a woman from Somalia, four men from Afghanistan, a man from Egypt and one person from Vietnam. For Rzgar Hussein Mohammed, the pain of losing his wife and three children to the waters that night is too much to bear.  A month on, despite freezing temperatures, hundreds of migrants have continued to cross the Channel each week. Evicted from their makeshift camps by the French police in Calais, many say they have little choice but to take their chances with the Channel’s waves.

All sports events in Wales go behind closed doorsPost-Christmas rugby games and Welsh Grand National are among events which will have no crowds.Wales politics,"More restrictions in Wales could be announced on Wednesday Wales will need more restrictions to keep the country safe, a senior Welsh government minister has said. Ministers will announce on Wednesday their plans for the post-Christmas period. Economy Minister Vaughan Gething said limits on household mixing were part of the Welsh government's discussions. It comes as spectators are banned from all indoor, outdoor, professional and community sports events in Wales from 26 December. Mr Gething said a Â£3m Spectator Sports Fund will be available to support clubs and venues. He said he expected ""several thousand"" identified Omicron cases in Wales by Boxing Day, with the real number being much higher. The number of Omicron cases identified in Wales rose by 204 on Tuesday to 640. Last week the Welsh government decided to shut nightclubs, and reintroduce social distancing in workplaces, from 27 December. Its cabinet met on Tuesday to discuss what happens next, including possible post-Christmas hospitality restrictions. Drakeford denies rules 'gambling' with livelihoods Nightclubs and restaurants fear New Year losses The Senedd will be recalled on Wednesday following a request from Welsh Conservative Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies. He said it was essential further changes were debated in the Senedd beforehand. ""The drip, drip effect of releasing restrictions by press release risks undermining public confidence at such an important time of the year for families and businesses,"" he said. ""Imposing restrictions on society must be done on the strongest possible evidence, and fully communicated to the Welsh public in the form we have become accustomed to during the pandemic - not released via press release at midnight."" The 2020 Welsh Grand National took place behind closed doors Plaid Cymru's sports spokeswoman Heledd Fychan said it was important sports clubs were supported. ""Our sports thrive with public support, and it's a cruel twist that so coronavirus thrives in crowds as well,"" she added. Out on the main shopping street in Treorchy, Rhondda Cynon Taf, there was a feeling of uncertainty about what's ahead. Rachel Evans, 50, said she was hoping her Boxing Day party with her two brothers and their families will still go ahead but she is prepared for the worst. ""It may have to be cancelled like it was last year. We did an online quiz then between us all. ""But we've seen a lot of footfall in Treorchy over the last few days, people worrying about what's going to happen. The shops are really busy at the minute."" Her daughter, Carys Evans, 19, has plans to go out with friends on New Year's Eve. ""Who knows now, I probably won't,"" she said. ""It's a bit gutting because especially last year when we couldn't go out. It's another year of it, another year of nothing really."" The former health minister Mr Gething said more protections ""are likely to be introduced from the 27th onwards"". He called for the UK government to return to furlough ""because I'm confident that more protective measures will be needed to keep people safe and alive and well"". Speaking to BBC Wales Today, Mr Gething said limits on household mixing will ""definitely need to be part of the discussion"" on any further restrictions. He admitted there were consequences from many restrictions but said: ""The danger is we wait and we wait and we wait before we act and by then when the evidence is crystal in terms of numbers and percentages it is too late to act."" The Cardiff v Scarlets Boxing Day match at Cardiff Arms Park was set to be a sell-out Events affected by the decision to shut sports to spectators include the Cardiff versus Scarlets rugby match at Cardiff Arms Park on 26 December, and the Welsh Grand National in Chepstow the following day. The move comes a few weeks ahead of big international fixtures, with the first of three Six Nations home games on 12 February against Scotland, while the men's football team play Austria in a crucial World Cup play-off in Cardiff on 24 March. Scarlets boss Phil Morgan said the news is ""another significant financial blow to the business"", but health and safety will ""always be our utmost priority"". TheOspreys versus Dragons matchhad already been called off because of a Covid outbreak, as had football matches involving Cardiff City and Newport County. The Welsh government said restrictions would be reviewed regularly, adding: ""Crowds will come back as soon as possible. We want everyone to be here to enjoy their favourite sports."" On these new restrictions, Mr Gething said: ""We need to do everything we can to protect people's health and control the spread of this awful virus."" The Welsh government said further details about the Â£3m support package would be made available following discussions with the sector. It added that a sporting event referred to all indoor and outdoor sporting events, whether ticketed or not, with spectators. It said this included larger sporting events and those at every level, including community level, which attract significantly smaller crowds. Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford has warned of further restrictions amid rising Omicron cases The overall rate of coronavirus infections is also rising in Wales, standing at 575 per 100,000 people. It has the lowest case rate of the nations. In hospitals, a total of 87.6% of acute hospital beds are occupied, slightly down on two weeks ago. The number of Covid patients on invasive ventilation or in critical care beds stands at 30, the lowest number seen since 23 August. There are more than four times the number of non-Covid patients in critical care. First Minister Mark Drakeford has warned of ""a gathering storm"" of Omicron infections after the Christmas period and has already announced that nightclubs will shut down at midnight on Boxing Day. He also said it was ""inevitable"" there would be further restrictions for pubs and restaurants after Christmas. The Welsh government said the new sports restrictions would be ""reviewed regularly"". Speaking toRadio Wales Breakfast, Prof Lawrence Young, a virologist at the University of Warwick, called for clarity on gatherings over Christmas, adding there were concerns over waiting while the virus continues to double every two days. ""The longer we leave it, the worse this is going to get. Waiting for more hospitalisations to increase before you make a move could be too little too late,"" he said. He added that the World Health Organization had advised ""it is better to cancel events than cancel lives"". ""We need to have more time to get jabs into arms. We know that the vaccine programme is going really well, but it's a very, very stretched target to get all adults boosted by the end of December."" Darren Hughes, director of the Welsh NHS Confederation, added it was not only the number of patients with Omicron that could put pressure on hospitals, but also the number of staff absences. ""It is starting to have a real serious impactâ¦ this isn't just down to government this is down to us as individuals to do all we can to protect ourselves and the family,"" he said.
