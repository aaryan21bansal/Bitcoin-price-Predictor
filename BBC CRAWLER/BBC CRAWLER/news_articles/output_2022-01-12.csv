What's next for Prince Andrew?,"It couldn't have been a worse result for Prince Andrew. Just weeks ago, speculation was mounting that his team might have come up with a slam-dunk winner that would stop this case in its tracks. But, using another American sporting metaphor,Wednesday's resultshows it had all been a bit of a Hail Mary: a desperate last-minute attempt to reverse the result that was doomed to fail. In46 pages,,externalJudge Lewis Kaplan not only dismissed the attempts to stop Virginia Giuffre's civil damages claim against the Duke of York, he also underlined that many of the arguments had been worthless. Prince Andrew's lawyers had argued that Virginia Giuffre's case should be stopped for the following reasons: Her 2009 settlement with Jeffrey Epstein barred her from suing anyone else Her allegations were basically vague His rights as a defendant were being breached Let's look at those in turn. For months, we've heard from Prince Andrew's side that the previouslyconfidential settlementbetween convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and Ms Giuffre was a trump card. In that agreement she agreed not to bring any future cases against other ""potential defendants"". And so Prince Andrew's team argued that he could have been a ""potential defendant"". But nobody really knows - because Judge Kaplan said that the law prevents him from speculating what Epstein and Ms Giuffre intended when they signed up to those words. He said that the phrase ""potential defendants"" could literally mean anybody at all. The settlement did not clearly and unambiguously show that both parties wanted Prince Andrew to benefit from it. The prince's lawyers presented the judge with examples from other cases that they said showed he had a right to benefit from the deal as an affected third party. But Judge Kaplan was so unimpressed he declared they had been ""of no assistance"". That's basically judge talk for a waste of his time. Andrew to face civil sex assault case, judge rules Who is Prince Andrew accuser Virginia Giuffre? What are the accusations against Prince Andrew? Andrew accuserâs 2009 deal with Epstein published The prince's lawyers have argued that the substance ofMs Giuffre's allegationsdo not amount to a violation of New York law. But Judge Kaplan said that all Ms Giuffre has to show at this early stage of the case is that her complaint was plausible. ""The allegation that [Ms Giuffre] was forced to sit on [Prince Andrew's] lap while he touched her is sufficient to state a battery claim under New York law, regardless of which part of her body the defendant ultimately is alleged to have touched,"" ruled Judge Kaplan. ""[Bodily] contact is offensive if it is wrongful under all the circumstances, which certainly is a reasonable inference from Ms Giuffre's allegations. ""Ms Giuffre's complaint is neither unintelligible, nor vague nor ambiguous, It alleges discrete incidents of sexual abuse in particular circumstances at three identifiable locations,"" he said. ""While [Prince Andrew] understandably seeks more detail... he will be able to obtain that detail during pretrial discovery."" That's a reference to the case's next phase, which I explain below. As for a complaint that her allegations duplicated each other, Judge Kaplan said they were sufficiently different - and it would be for a jury to decide how they overlap and what that would mean for any potential damages. Lawyers for the prince had also argued that the New York Child Victims Act - the law Ms Giuffre is using to bring the two-decades-old allegations - is unconstitutional because it allowed her to revive allegations that would otherwise be too late to bring to a court. But Judge Kaplan said that argument had been tried before - and thrown out by every New York and federal court to have heard it. Well, firstly, case number ""1:21-cv-06702"" now appears unstoppable because the judge has set a clear timetable. In the coming days, the court may have to consider sending letters on behalf of Ms Giuffre to the British courts if it needs their assistance in gathering evidence. This is not unusual - it's part and parcel of transatlantic actions. Then, by the middle of May, both sides must declare their witnesses. At the same time, they must get on with providing evidence to each other. Virginia Giuffre with her lawyer David Boies in 2019 Ms Giuffre wants proof that Prince Andrew could not sweat at the time when she says they met. She wants proof of his now world-famous night out in Woking's Pizza Express. His lawyers will want her evidence on where she actually lives. They may try to argue later that the case must stop because she lives in Australia and has no legal connection to the US. By 14 July, Judge Kaplan wants all evidence exchanged and ""deposition"" to be completed. That means the witnesses' evidence taken by lawyers and recorded for use in court later on. That means both the prince and Ms Giuffre putting their accounts on the record. He will face incredibly personal questions - as will she. And perhaps others will too. He could try to appeal against the ruling - but that's by no means guaranteed. If it were accepted by the higher court, that would naturally delay things. If Prince Andrew does not appeal and fails to co-operate with the timetable and exchange of evidence, Ms Giuffre can apply for an automatic judgement in her favour. So, assuming the appeal route doesn't materialise, he has a simple choice: he either has to take part, prepare to give his side of the story and have it defended one way or another in court - or he has to settle. There is, of course, legal risk for Ms Giuffre too. The burden is on her to prove her case. And the closer a case gets to trial, the bigger the financial risks become for a claimant because it just gets more and more expensive. Her lawyer David Boies says justice would include some form of recognition from the prince of his actions - but he has always denied the allegations. So the question now is this: if the prince's team make her a cash offer, will she accept it?

"Husband, 71, in court accused of murdering wife","Linda Maggs suffered at least 15 stab wounds to her neck, chest and hands A husband stabbed his wife to death before dialling 999 to say he had ""just killed"" her, a court has heard. Linda Maggs, 74, suffered at least 15 stab wounds to her neck, chest and hands on Saturday 6 February, 2021. Cardiff Crown Court heard David Maggs, of Sebastopol, Pontypool, took two large kitchen knives to Mrs Maggs' bedroom, stabbing her in bed. Mr Maggs, 71, admits manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility, but denies murder. He claims he ""blanked out"" and does not recall the event. When police arrived at Mr Maggs' home at about 09:15 GMT last 6 February, he told them he had ""had enough"". Pontypool man, 70, in custody accused of murdering wife Pontypool man arrested on suspicion of murder after woman dies Family tributes paid to Pontypool 'amazing mum and nan' found dead The court heard he said: ""She tried to steal two houses from me, two houses. I am responsible for the death of her. I've killed my bloody wife."" The couple were going through ""acrimonious"" divorce proceedings. A decree nisi was due to be granted a month after Mrs Maggs' death on the grounds of Mr Maggs' unreasonable behaviour. The court heard Mr Maggs was angered by probes into his finances that were part of divorce proceedings and didn't want her to benefit from a settlement. She was found dead at the home she shared with David Maggs last year Mr Maggs is said to have become obsessed by the idea his wife had hidden money from him and would gain dishonestly from their divorce. The couple remained living at their home at in Landsdowne, Sebastopol, with Mr Maggs taking the living room and bedroom, which were both fitted with locks. His wife took other rooms, including a bedroom. She had a lock for it but it was not fitted. Mr Maggs told officers he had gone into her bedroom on the morning of her death because he wanted to talk about the divorce, but Mrs Maggs told him to get out and refused to talk about it. They had not spoken for two months. When officers took him to Ystrad Mynach hospital to be examined he said: ""Thirty years we've been married and she couldn't keep her mouth shut, so I topped her."" Reminded he was under caution said: ""I can't remember it mind."" The court was told Mr Maggs repeatedly told people he wanted to stab his wife. The prosecution said he told a housing association support worker, an estate agent and a friend of the couple he wanted to kill her. The support worker was so concerned, the court heard, he contacted police and his GP. The police spoke to Mr Maggs in November 2020 but no action was taken. Mike Jones QC, prosecuting, told the jury Mr Maggs was going through his third divorce and did not want his wife to benefit from an asset split. His finances were under investigation as part of the divorce proceedings. When Gwent Police looked at paperwork they found discrepancies between what it said and what Mr Maggs had declared. Gwent Police discovered he had not revealed a savings account containing Â£14,000. Mr Jones told the court Mr Maggs had expressed neither regret nor remorse. ""He knew exactly what he was doing when he took those knives from the kitchen and stabbed her to death,"" he said. ""He threatened to do it more than once in the months and days before. ""He made good that threat on February 6th and murdered his wife."" The case continues.

"Government's PPE 'VIP lane' unlawful, court rules","The government's use of a ""VIP lane"" to award contracts for personal protective equipment (PPE) to two companies was unlawful, the High Court has ruled. Campaigners claimed the VIP lane was reserved for referrals from MPs, ministers and senior officials and gave some companies an unfair advantage. A judge ruled it was unlawful to give the two companies preferential treatment as part of the VIP lane. But she said both offers were likely to have been given contracts anyway. The legal action was brought by the Good Law Project and EveryDoctor which claimed the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) unlawfully awarded contracts to supply PPE - such as medical quality facemasks and gowns - during the height of the first wave of the coronavirus pandemic. Why were the government's Covid contracts challenged? 50 firms got VIP fast-track Covid contracts WATCH ON IPLAYER: Panorama - Cashing in on Covid The groups took legal action over more than Â£340m in contracts awarded to PestFix, a firm that supplies pest control products, and a contract worth about Â£252m to the hedge fund Ayanda Capital. The campaigners said the DHSC ""prioritised suppliers including PestFix and Ayanda because of who they knew, not what they could deliver"". But the DHSC told the court it ""wholeheartedly"" rejected the case against it and said the VIP lane was rational and resulted in a ""large number of credible offers"" in an environment where PPE deals often failed within ""minutes"". Mrs Justice O'Farrell ruled that while the use of the VIP lane - officially known as the high priority lane - was unlawful, she found that both of the companies' offers ""justified priority treatment"" on their merits and were ""very likely"" to have been awarded contracts even without it. The judge said the DHSC's evidence ""establishes that presence on the high priority lane did not confer any advantage at the decision-making stage of the process"", but she said it was clear that ""offers that were introduced through the senior referrers received earlier consideration at the outset of the process"". She said the high priority lane team was better resourced and able to respond more quickly to offers but she also found ""sufficient financial due diligence"" was carried out in respect of both sets of contracts. A DHSC spokesperson said at the height of the pandemic there had been a ""desperate need for PPE to protect health and social care staff"" and said the government ""rightly took swift and decisive action to secure it"". ""The ruling says it is highly likely these offers would have been awarded if they were processed through other channels also used to process offers. All contracts underwent sufficient financial and technical due diligence and the court found that we did not rely on the referral to the high priority lane when awarding contracts,"" they said. A spokesman for Matt Hancock, who was health secretary at the time the contracts were awarded, said he was delighted that the court found that the priority treatment was ""justified"". He said: ""As the National Audit Office has confirmed, ministers had no involvement in procurement decisions or contract management. ""The department was doing the best it possibly could within the rules to respond to an unprecedented situation, and crucially, the court has rightly found that action was justified and absolutely no rectification or further action is necessary."" A court previously ruled that Mr Hancock hadacted unlawfully when his department did not reveal details of contractsit had signed during the Covid pandemic. A PestFix spokesman said the company was pleased to have been ""completely vindicated"" by the High Court over how the contract was awarded, saying the decision was ""based purely on our ability to deliver"". He added the company had only been made aware that it had been placed in the high priority lane by a National Audit Office report in November 2020. A spokesman for Ayanda Capital said: ""We are pleased that, despite all the claims to the contrary, the court has rejected any suggestion that we were not an appropriate business to source desperately-needed personal protective equipment and concluded that the offer we made the Department of Health justified priority treatment on its merits."" The company was ""doing the best we possibly could to help to respond to an unprecedented national emergency"", he said, adding that the court had not criticised the way it had conducted itself in anyway. Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner called for an independent investigation to ""get to the bottom of how Â£3.5bn of taxpayers' cash were handed out in crony contracts and ensure it can never happen again"". Liberal Democrat health spokesperson Daisy Cooper described the ruling as a ""damning judgement"" and said: ""Not only did the Conservatives give their mates privileged access to lucrative Covid contracts, they did it unlawfully."" The high priority lane, or VIP lane, was introduced on 2 April 2020 in order to help the government choose between the offers it was getting in huge numbers. The idea was to treat offers of PPE with greater urgency if they came from a supplier recommended by ministers, government officials or MPs and members of the House of Lords, from any party. ANational Audit Office report,externalfound that up to the end of July 2020, about one in 10 suppliers who had been put in the high priority lane was then awarded contracts, while the figure was less than one in 100 for other suppliers. Between the start of the pandemic and 30 May 2021, the DHSC distributed more than 11.7 billion items of PPE. But there have been issues with some items of equipment bought by the government, including masks and gowns that havehad to be withdrawn from use in the NHS. 50 firms got VIP fast-track Covid contracts Government acted unlawfully over Covid contract Hancock acted unlawfully over Covid contracts Why have Covid contracts been challenged?

Nightclubs still waiting for Covid funding support,"Nightclub owners have criticised the slow rollout of financial support for their businesses, which have been closed again under Covid restrictions. Clubs have been closed since 27 December withNicola Sturgeon announcing the shutdown will remain in place until at least 24 January. But trade groups said Scottish government funding promised before Christmas has not yet materialised. Deputy First Minister John Swinney said the grants will be paid ""very soon"". Restrictions on large outdoor events in Scotland, including football matches and concerts, are to be lifted from next Monday. But limits on indoor events and venues will remain in place for at least another week as part of a phased approach to lifting measures brought in to help deal with a surge in Covid cases caused by the Omicron variant. Scotland's nightclubs to close for three weeks from 27 December Nightclubs close and 1m distancing returns Restrictions on large outdoor events in Scotland lifted Gavin Stevenson, vice-chairman of the Night Time Industries Association Scotland (NTIAS) and director of the Mor-Rioghain Group of hospitality venues, toldBBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme: ""As of today not a single penny of the funds promised before Christmas have reached businesses. ""It is putting businesses in an incredibly difficult situation, wondering how on earth they are going to pay their staff this week when they've got no money in the bank because they have been forced to close or trade is unviable by the current round of restrictions."" Mr Stevenson claimed the forms for the Scottish government's nightclub closure fund had not been issued yet, adding this is putting business owners and their staff ""in an untenable position"". Confetti raining down on people queueing outside the Buff Club in Glasgow which is among the venues affected by lengthy periods of closure over the last two years required by Covid rules Deputy First Minister John Swinney told Good Morning Scotland that the funding issue ""has got the attention of ministers"". He added: ""We're moving as quickly as we possibly can do to make the financial support available to the sectors which have been affected by the restrictions. ""We work closely with local authorities to make sure such funding arrangements can be put in place. ""The timescale should be very soon, it's difficult to give a precise timescale but I would think within the next two weeks would be a reasonable expectation."" Mr Swinney said the delay was partly down to setting up the payment process and the public holidays over the Christmas period. The government's nightclub closure fund allows venues to apply for a grant up to Â£55,000. Other hospitality businesses have also spoken of the impact restrictions have had on trade. Restrictions were introduced for pubs, restaurants and other indoor public places on 27 December. Indoor hospitality and leisure venues have to ensure there is a one-metre distance between different groups of people, and table service is required where alcohol is served. Scott Mitchell, managing director of Surgeons Quarter, which runs a hotel and events business in Edinburgh, said it had lost Â£225,000 in sales due to cancellations of Christmas and Hogmanay events. He said: ""While we welcome the apparent mindset shift towards gearing up for living with the pandemic, the government simply isn't doing enough to save hospitality. ""The first minister is leaving the sector with support measures that are not fit for purpose and arbitrary restrictions that will result in countless lost jobs and livelihoods. ""The support we are receiving equates to roughly 3% of the sales we have lost, which are in excess of Â£225,000."" Dr Liz Cameron, chief executive of the Scottish Chambers of Commerce, added: ""Businesses urgently need the financial support promised to them to be delivered as quickly as possible and additional financial support is made available should restrictions remain in place any longer."" Scottish Conservative MSP Murdo Fraser said many hospitality businesses were struggling and needed urgent support. He continued: ""It's unacceptable that struggling businesses already on their knees as a result of Scottish government restrictions are still waiting to receive a penny in financial support - and are now being told it may be a further fortnight before they do so. ""Many of these businesses are in danger of going under, so every day counts."" Meanwhile, the Scottish government is also facing calls to end the outdoor restrictions earlier than Monday. Partick Thistle has said it faces ""significant financial impact"" as a result of crowd limits still being in place on Saturday. Indoor sports clubs have also questioned why they are still facing restrictions. RULES:What are the restrictions in Scotland?

Man damages BBC headquarters statue with hammer,"The man was seen hitting the statue on Wednesday afternoon A man has taken a hammer to a statue on the BBC's Broadcasting House in central London. The Prospero and Ariel statue was carved by Eric Gill andhas been on displayat the BBC since 1933. There has been a campaign to have the statue removed for several years, because the sculptorrecorded sexually abusing his daughters in his diaries,external. Police were called to the scene at about 16:15 GMT and the man was brought down about four hours later. BBC staff reported hearing the man shout ""paedophile"" as he struck the statue at Broadcasting House, which is connected to New Broadcasting House, the BBC's main headquarters. A cherry picker was used to bring the man down A spokesman for the Met said the man was brought down with the help of a fire crew. He was checked over by ambulance workers before being arrested on suspicion of criminal damage and taken into custody, he added. He said the property owners were examining any damage to the statue and building. Earlier the force said another man had been arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to commit criminal damage. A spokeswoman for the BBC declined to comment. In recent years, groups such as QAnon have campaigned against the statue carved by Gill, who died in 1940. The statue, carved by Eric Gill, has adorned Broadcasting House since 1933 The attack on the statue comes a week after four people accused of illegally removing a statue of 17th Century slave trader Edward Colston in Bristolwere cleared of criminal damage. It happened during a Black Lives Matter protest in the city in 2020, during a widespread debate about the place of certain historical statues in modern society. By Katie Razzall, culture editor What defines an artist - their work or their life? Ever since Eric Gill's crimes have come to light, it's been something to ponder as you walk into the BBC's Old Broadcasting House, entering the building under his looming Prospero and Ariel. But when I arrived at work on Wednesday afternoon, a ladder was leaning up against the building and a man stood on the plinth above the doorway, shouting ""paedophile"" and attacking the statue with a hammer, feet first. He was also trying to detach the 10ft (3m) sculpture from whatever anchors it to the BBC offices. On the pavement, another man livestreamed it. With every loud smash, there'd be a moan or a shout of ""stop"" from someone in the gathering crowd below. It felt brutal; an assault on beauty. Eric Gill was a monster, a depraved paedophile who abused his daughters and others. But as a sculptor he made wondrous creations. At a time when statues across the country are being reassessed, there'll be those who believe that if it's legal to tear down a monument to a prominent slaver, as happened in Bristol, it is also time to do the same to an artwork by a man who committed horrific sexual crimes.

Chelsea beat Spurs to reach EFL Cup final,"Antonio Rudiger also scored in Chelsea's 3-0 Premier League victory at Tottenham in September Chelsea eased into the Carabao Cup final as they closed out a comfortable semi-final win over Tottenham. Spurs never seriously threatened to overturn Chelsea's two-goal first-leg advantage and Antonio Rudiger's bundled finish from Mason Mount's corner after 18 minutes effectively confirmed a Wembley date with either Arsenal or Liverpool. It was a night of frustration for Spurs and their former Chelsea manager Antonio Conte as they saw two penalties, awarded by referee Andre Marriner for fouls on Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg and Lucas Moura, correctly overturned by VAR. Harry Kane also saw a goal ruled out for offside in an improved second-half performance from Spurs but Chelsea always looked in control - and once they had extended their aggregate lead early on, they were able to control affairs without hitting their best form. The game was paused late on following a medical emergency in the crowd and on resumption Chelsea completed the formalities of their victory. Tuchel 'confident' of new Rudiger deal How Tottenham v Chelsea unfolded Go straight to all the best Spurs content Get the best Blues content here Spurs manager Conte has made no secret of the size of his job in rejuvenating this club after their recent decline - and any doubts over that diagnosis were removed by Chelsea's obvious superiority here. It was still a mystery, however, as to why Conte felt the need to rest experienced keeper and captain Hugo Lloris with the tie still on the line and play deputy Pierluigi Gollini instead. Gollini distinguished himself when he saved with his legs from Romelu Lukaku early on but was at fault when he made an unconvincing dash to claim Mount's corner, a move that ended badly when the ball was diverted into net via Rudiger's back. This was surely a job that required the presence of Lloris when Spurs' margin of error was virtually non-existent. Spurs did mount a challenge of sorts after the break but it was too little, too late - and this was a mediocre display that only illustrated how much work Conte needs to do. Kane battled but remains short of his best form while there was a lack of creativity in midfield that allowed Chelsea to contain Spurs with relative comfort. Conte will be expecting serious backing from Spurs chairman Daniel Levy if his drive and fierce ambition is to be satisfied. At present, he has a squad that requires serious investment before there can be thoughts of getting anywhere near the Premier League elite. Chelsea are now in their third successive final under Thomas Tuchel since he arrived to succeed the sacked Frank Lampard almost a year ago. He guided them to the FA Cup final last season, which Chelsea lost to Leicester City, before claiming the biggest European club prize of all by winning the Champions League against Manchester City in Porto. The job of reaching the EFL Cup final was largely done in the first game at Stamford Bridge but Chelsea came out here with the sort of determination and attacking intent that made it clear they were determined to snuff out Spurs' hopes as quickly as possible. Lukaku wasted one chance to do that but the early goal they desired came from Rudiger, which gave Spurs a task they never looked like accomplishing. Tuchel, standards as high as ever, cut a dissatisfied figure at times in the second half when Chelsea's intensity dropped and a little complacency appeared to creep into their game, giving Spurs opportunities they never had in the first 45 minutes. Chelsea's players responded to their manager's demands and this tie was played out in a testimonial atmosphere in the closing minutes as Spurs fans deserted the stadium in droves, leaving one corner packed with joyous, celebrating visiting supporters. The strength of Chelsea's squad was shown once more as Tuchel was able to bring on Thiago Silva, Marcos Alonso, Hakim Ziyech, Ruben Loftus-Cheek and N'Golo Kante in the second half to ensure the door was never left ajar for Spurs. Indeed, it was slammed firmly in their faces. It shows the scale of the job Tuchel has done that in the 350 days since his first game at Chelsea, he has become the first manager in their history to guide them to a Champions League, FA Cup and EFL Cup final. And, on this evidence, Chelsea will take some stopping, whoever they face at Wembley at the end of February.

Chelsea beat Spurs to reach EFL Cup finalAntonio Rudiger's header makes sure of Chelsea's place in the EFL Cup final as they beat Tottenham 1-0 on the night to complete a 3-0 aggregate win.,"Antonio Rudiger also scored in Chelsea's 3-0 Premier League victory at Tottenham in September Chelsea eased into the Carabao Cup final as they closed out a comfortable semi-final win over Tottenham. Spurs never seriously threatened to overturn Chelsea's two-goal first-leg advantage and Antonio Rudiger's bundled finish from Mason Mount's corner after 18 minutes effectively confirmed a Wembley date with either Arsenal or Liverpool. It was a night of frustration for Spurs and their former Chelsea manager Antonio Conte as they saw two penalties, awarded by referee Andre Marriner for fouls on Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg and Lucas Moura, correctly overturned by VAR. Harry Kane also saw a goal ruled out for offside in an improved second-half performance from Spurs but Chelsea always looked in control - and once they had extended their aggregate lead early on, they were able to control affairs without hitting their best form. The game was paused late on following a medical emergency in the crowd and on resumption Chelsea completed the formalities of their victory. Tuchel 'confident' of new Rudiger deal How Tottenham v Chelsea unfolded Go straight to all the best Spurs content Get the best Blues content here Spurs manager Conte has made no secret of the size of his job in rejuvenating this club after their recent decline - and any doubts over that diagnosis were removed by Chelsea's obvious superiority here. It was still a mystery, however, as to why Conte felt the need to rest experienced keeper and captain Hugo Lloris with the tie still on the line and play deputy Pierluigi Gollini instead. Gollini distinguished himself when he saved with his legs from Romelu Lukaku early on but was at fault when he made an unconvincing dash to claim Mount's corner, a move that ended badly when the ball was diverted into net via Rudiger's back. This was surely a job that required the presence of Lloris when Spurs' margin of error was virtually non-existent. Spurs did mount a challenge of sorts after the break but it was too little, too late - and this was a mediocre display that only illustrated how much work Conte needs to do. Kane battled but remains short of his best form while there was a lack of creativity in midfield that allowed Chelsea to contain Spurs with relative comfort. Conte will be expecting serious backing from Spurs chairman Daniel Levy if his drive and fierce ambition is to be satisfied. At present, he has a squad that requires serious investment before there can be thoughts of getting anywhere near the Premier League elite. Chelsea are now in their third successive final under Thomas Tuchel since he arrived to succeed the sacked Frank Lampard almost a year ago. He guided them to the FA Cup final last season, which Chelsea lost to Leicester City, before claiming the biggest European club prize of all by winning the Champions League against Manchester City in Porto. The job of reaching the EFL Cup final was largely done in the first game at Stamford Bridge but Chelsea came out here with the sort of determination and attacking intent that made it clear they were determined to snuff out Spurs' hopes as quickly as possible. Lukaku wasted one chance to do that but the early goal they desired came from Rudiger, which gave Spurs a task they never looked like accomplishing. Tuchel, standards as high as ever, cut a dissatisfied figure at times in the second half when Chelsea's intensity dropped and a little complacency appeared to creep into their game, giving Spurs opportunities they never had in the first 45 minutes. Chelsea's players responded to their manager's demands and this tie was played out in a testimonial atmosphere in the closing minutes as Spurs fans deserted the stadium in droves, leaving one corner packed with joyous, celebrating visiting supporters. The strength of Chelsea's squad was shown once more as Tuchel was able to bring on Thiago Silva, Marcos Alonso, Hakim Ziyech, Ruben Loftus-Cheek and N'Golo Kante in the second half to ensure the door was never left ajar for Spurs. Indeed, it was slammed firmly in their faces. It shows the scale of the job Tuchel has done that in the 350 days since his first game at Chelsea, he has become the first manager in their history to guide them to a Champions League, FA Cup and EFL Cup final. And, on this evidence, Chelsea will take some stopping, whoever they face at Wembley at the end of February.

LiveLiveGiuffre 'pleased' she can take Prince Andrew to court6 minutes ago,"A US woman, who accuses Prince Andrew of sexually assaulting her 20 years ago, has welcomed a judge's decision that she can take him to court Virginia Giuffre is suing the Queen's second son, saying he sexually assaulted her on three occasions when she was under the age of 18 Giuffre alleges that the duke's friends - convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein and sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell - lent her out for sex with wealthy and powerful associates, including the prince Andrew has constantly denied the allegations and attempted to get the case dismissed by a judge in New York His lawyers had argued in court that Giuffre waived her rights to sue him as part of a settlement with Epstein But Giuffre's team said only the parties of the settlement agreement could benefit from it, and not a ""third party"" In a 46-page decision, judge Lewis A Kaplan in New York said the agreement ""cannot be said"" to benefit Prince Andrew Edited by Claudia Allen That's all from the live team for this evening - thank you for joining us. These updates were written by Matt Murphy, James McFadden and Nathan Williams in London and Holly Honderich and Sam Cabral in the US. The page was edited by Thom Poole and Claudia Allen. We're now pausing our live coverage of Virginia Giuffre's civil suit against the Queen's second son, Prince Andrew. Giuffre, now 38, says the prince sexually assaulted her on three occasions beginning in March 2001 when she was 17. He has denied all allegations against him and said that he does not recall ever meeting her. US district Judge Lewis A Kaplan ruled on Wednesday that Giuffre could move forward with her sex abuse suit against the Duke of York. Judge Kaplan rejected arguments by the prince that he was protected by a 2009 plea agreement between Giuffre and Jeffrey Epstein, which bars Giuffre from pursuing litigation against Epstein and anyone who could be a ""potential defendant"". Prince Andrew now faces three choices: head to court, appeal the decision, or reach a legal settlement with Giuffre. Experts say none of the options are good ones for the prince. The clock is already ticking for the Duke of York. Aiming for an autumn trial, Giuffre's lawyers will soon begin seeking evidence from his legal team. A lawyer for Giuffre said she was ""pleased"" by the ruling and that she looks forward to pursuing her case in court. Buckingham Palace declined to comment on the ""ongoing legal matter"". Prince Andrew gave a key interview to BBC Newsnight's Emily Maitlis in November 2019, in which he ""categorically"" denied having any sexual contact with Virginia Giuffre. Maitlis has since written about the moment she sat down in a Buckingham Palace ballroomposing questions that ""seemed almost too surreal to ask"". In an earlier meeting with the prince, prepping for the interview, he had ""volunteered the information to me in that early meeting that he was 'unable to sweat'"", she says. Virginia Giuffre had alleged she had danced with a sweating Prince Andrew in a London club. The royal was also asked to explain his whereabouts on the night Giuffre alleged he had danced with her. ""His office had checked the date, and told us he couldn't have been with her because he had been at a children's birthday party that same evening."" In the interview, the prince said the party had taken place at a Pizza Express in Woking. Giuffre's legal teamhas since asked for proof of the duke's alleged inability to sweat. It was an interview that grabbed the attention of the world, and led to the Duke of York stepping back from public life. For the BBC's 5 Minutes On, Emily Maitlis describes the 2019 interview and how it might play a crucial role in what happens next to the prince. This video can not be played Prince Andrew fails to get US civil case dismissed. Virginia Giuffre with her lawyer David Boies (right) Virginia Giuffre's lawyers are pleased at the ruling out of New York. In a statement, Sigrid McCawley wrote: âTodayâs decision by Judge Kaplan denying Prince Andrewâs effort to dismiss Virginia Giuffreâs case against him is another important step in Virginiaâs heroic and determined pursuit of justice as a survivor of sex trafficking."" Earlier, we reported that McCawley's co-counsel David Boies said Giuffre was ""pleased"" the Duke of York's motion had been denied and she ""looks forward"" to bringing her case in court. Neither the prince nor his lawyers have made a statement in response to today's decision. The duke has vigorously denied Giuffre's allegations against him. More now on the details of today's legal ruling by a New York judge. Judge Kaplan, as part of his ruling, addressed an argument by Prince
Andrewâs legal team that a New York state law giving victims of child sexual abuse more time to sue is âunconstitutional"". The state's Child Victimâs Act allows such victims to sue until they turn 55 years
old, giving those who suffered decades-old abuse a chance to seek justice. Prince
Andrew's lawyers said that while the law allowed survivors to sue for abuses
they suffered before they were 18 years old, the age of consent in New York is
17. That's the age Ms Giuffre was when she says she was abused by the royal (allegations he denies). Judge
Kaplan said Prince Andrew is not the first person to try and use this argument in
court, but it has been ârejected by every New York state and federal court to
have encountered it.â He adds: âIt
has been rejected repeatedly for good reason.â Read more about the Child Victimâs Act. Melissa Murray, a professor of law at New York University, says that allowing the allegations against Prince Andrew to advance to a civil trial in a New York court could be ""embarrassing to the monarchy"". But Prof Murray also warned that pursuing a settlement with Virginia Giuffre outside of court would be widely viewed as an implicit admission of wrongdoing on the Duke's part - which he has always strenuously denied. This video can not be played Prof Melissa Murray says a trial would be ""embarrassing to the monarchy"" Prince Andrew's lawyers had argued that Virginia Giuffre was prevented from pursuing her civil case against him due to a legal settlement she'd reached with Jeffrey Epstein in 2009. A clause in that agreement blocked future cases against Epstein and anyone else who could be a ""potential defendant"". But in his verdict, Judge Lewis A Kaplan said that the agreement, ""whatever it was intended to mean, is riddled with drafting problems and ambiguitiesâ. He added that the clause is far too broad and that it is unclear who exactly it is intended to cover. Judge Kaplan also said that an agreement must leave no reasonable doubt about the intent of the contracting parties and said that where such ambiguity exists it ""must be resolved byâ¦ a trial jury"". He told the duke's lawyers that the court cannot ""resolve any such
ambiguity on a motion to dismiss the complaint."" Prince Andrew has consistently denied Ms Giuffre's claims. A 2001 photo of Prince Andrew with Virginia Giuffre and Ghislaine Maxwell Prince Andrew has said he has ""no recollection"" of ever meeting Virginia Giuffre. Giuffre claims she was forced to have sex with the Duke of York on three occasions - in London, New York and on a private Caribbean island owned by late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein - between 2001 and 2002, beginning when she was 17. An infamous photo of the two together, with the prince's arm around Giuffre's waist, is what she says proves that first meeting in March 2001. Also in the frame is a smiling Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's former girlfriend and business associate, now convicted of trafficking girls for him to abuse. The photo is said to have been taken by Epstein himself inside the Belgravia townhouse belonging to Maxwell. Of the photo, the prince has suggested it may well have been doctored, adding that ""hug[s] and public displays of affection are not something that I do"". While Giuffre alleges they went to a nightclub and had sex at Maxwell's home later that evening, Prince Andrew insists he was actually with his daughter at a Pizza Express restaurant in the town of Woking, near London, on that day. BBC royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell says today's ruling in New York is ""a monumental mess"" for the Royal Family. ""We are not three days now since Buckingham Palace confirmed all the details of the [Queen's] Platinum Jubilee and we have the prospect of this civil sex case against her second son in September,"" he says. Our correspondent says further public airing of the claims against the Duke of York - which he denies - make it ""very, very hard"" for him to have any sort of public role within the family. ""He clings on to his colonelship of the Grenadier Guards,"" says Witchell. ""I'll tell you this: the Grenadier Guards don't want him."" The Guards have not spoken publicly about the case, he notes, but ""behind the scenes, they are acutely embarrassed to have Prince Andrew as their colonel"". This video can not be played Prince Andrew case 'a monumental mess' This video can not be played Virginia Giuffre on Prince Andrew: 'I knew I had to keep him happy' Back in 2019, Virginia Giuffre told BBC Panorama that she had been brought to Britain aged 17 to have sex with Prince Andrew and implored the British public to ""stand beside her"". She said she had accompanied the paedophile Jeffrey Epstein and his then girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell, to London in March 2001, where they met the Duke of York. ""Weâre having tea and Andrewâs talking about Fergie, which is his
ex-wife. And Ghislaineâs bad mouthing Fergieâ¦ It seemed like friends just
catching up,"" she said. Roberts alleged that they later accompanied the Duke to Tramp nightclub. âHe asked me to dance,"" Roberts recalled during the interview. ""He is the most hideous dancer Iâve ever
seenâ¦ and this guy was sweating all over meâ¦ But I knew I had to keep him happy
because thatâs what Jeffrey and Ghislaine would expect from me. ""In the car, Ghislaine tells me that I had to do for Andrew what I
do for Jeffrey. And that made me sick. I just didnât expect it from royalty,"" she said. She alleged that later that evening, she had sex with Prince Andrew upstairs at Maxwell's house in Belgravia, London. ""It was a wicked time in my life. It was a really scary time in my
lifeâ¦ I wasnât chained to a sink, but these powerful people were my chains,"" Giuffre said. The Duke of York has consistently denied the claims, saying: ""It didn't happen."" If you're just joining us, Prince Andrew has failed in a bid to get a civil sex assault case
against him thrown out. Here's a recap about what's happened, and what it is all about: Mark Stephens, a defamation and reputation expert, told the BBC earlier that the Duke of York now finds himself ""in the last chance saloon with the towels over the taps"" and has only bad options ahead of him. ""Judge Lewis Kaplan has thrown this judicial decision like a bomb at the heart of the Royal Family,"" he said. Stephens noted that Prince Andrew faced ""three pretty bad options"" - appeal, settle or allow the case to go on and start giving evidence. He warned that, regardless of which path his lawyers took next, the duke's credibility was at serious risk. ""The one thing he can do is to accept the responsibility, accept the blame and accept that he has to fall on his sword for the sake of the wider family."" This video can not be played Prince Andrew's options 'increasingly limited' after failing to get civil case thrown out Prince Andrew is the Queen's third child and second son â and was the first child to beborn to a reigning monarch for 103 years. He's now ninth in line to the throne. He was created the Duke of York on his marriage to Sarah Ferguson, who became Duchess of York, in 1986. They have two daughters â Beatrice and Eugenie. In March 1992 it was announced the duke and duchess were to separate. They divorced in 1996, though remain close and still live together in the duke's home near Windsor. The duke served for 22 years in the Royal Navy and saw active service in the Falklands War in 1982. He also served as a special trade representative for the UK government until 2011. Andrew stepped away from royal duties in 2019 after a BBC Newsnight interview about Virginia Giuffre's allegations and his former friendship with the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Dominic CascianiHome Affairs Correspondent The legal clock is now ticking in Virginia Giuffre v Prince Andrew - because Judge Lewis Kaplan has set an unambiguous timetable to keep things moving towards a trial in the autumn. In the coming days, he wants to know whether his Manhattan court will be asked to send formal requests to the UK for assistance from judges in London with obtaining evidence. This is a common procedure in some international cases - but it may get complicated and political, depending on what Ms Giuffre's team ask for. By mid-May he wants to know who the witnesses are going to be for each side. While all this is going on, Ms Giuffre's team will be pressing for the prince's lawyers to disclose evidence. Their current demands - detailed in court papers - include information about the medical condition 20 years ago that prevented him sweating  and, secondly, evidence that he went to Woking Pizza Express. He must comply with these requests, if the evidence exists. By mid-July, witnesses will have filed their depositions. This means a formal recording of their evidence, on oath, out of court. If Prince Andrew refuses to comply with that, Virginia Giuffre can seek an automatic judgment in her favour at the end  of that month. Prince Andrew with Jeffrey Epstein in New York's Central Park in 2010 Virginia Giuffre alleges she was trafficked to London by Jeffrey Epstein in2001, when she was 17, and forced into sex with Prince Andrew. He says this did not happen. Here's a timeline of the key events in this case: A former prosecutor for the Southern District of New York has told the BBC that the range of options facing Prince Andrew have narrowed significantly. Sarah Krisoff said that the Duke of York must now seriously consider trying to resolve this civil case before it advances to trial some time later this year. This video can not be played Sarah Krisoff spoke to the BBC about the latest in the allegations against Prince Andrew. Virginia Giuffre's lawyer says she is ""pleased that Prince Andrewâs motion to
dismiss has been denied, and that evidence will now be taken concerning her
claims against him"". In a statement released a short while ago, David Boies adds that his client ""looks forward to a judicial determination of the merits
of those claims"". Boies, 80, is the chairman and managing partner of the US law firm Boies, Schiller & Flexner, and represents several alleged victims of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. He has previously said up to six witnesses are willing to testify in the civil case against the Duke of York (who has consistently denied the allegations). Now faced with a civil lawsuit in the US, Prince Andrew's best option is to settle, our royal correspondent Jonny Dymond continues. ""The cool heads among the US legal profession are saying: he does not want to go through the process of trial. ""Just the process of the trial going forward will be immensely difficult for him to navigate and immensely challenging for his reputation."" But crucially Virginia Guiffre must also agree to a settlement for the duke to avoid a courtroom drama. If the civil case does go forward, and Prince Andrew is compelled to appear in a US courtroom ""it would be one of the most astonishing moments in the royal familyâs modern history"", Dymond says. âWe are in strange territory now for the Queenâs second son.â Virginia Giuffre, then Roberts, was pictured with Prince Andrew in London in 2001 BBC royal correspondent Jonny Dymond says today's ruling in New York is ""a disastrous result"" for the Duke of York and ""very serious for the reputation"" of the royals. ""The Royal Family as an institution would love to see this case go away but it is not going away,"" he says. Our correspondent says Prince Andrew may have expected the 2009 deal struck between his accuser Virginia Giuffre and Jeffrey Epstein to be his ""get-out-of-jail-free card"" but the family will now likely endure ""six to 10 months of embarrassment"". ""There is the possibility of an appeal, but it's really slim,"" he notes. ""And the machinery of this case continues while that appeal goes on."" He adds: ""Even if Prince Andrew stays in England, there is a mechanism to enforce him giving testimony in a deposition for a US trial. His legal options are narrowing day by day."" Let's look back now at the interview the Duke of York gave to BBC Newsnight more than two years ago. He came to clear his name folllowing the Giuffre allegations. He believed things had been said about him that he could disprove. And he had his defence ready. ""The point of the interview was just to have a record of Prince Andrew's own version of events. He wanted to set his own record straight,""writes the BBC's Emily Maitlis, who interviewed the royal. Maitlis says the answers Prince Andrew gave - about a birthday party in Woking, a trip to Pizza Express, and his inability to sweat - then ""seemed almost comical"". ""But now suddenly, they feel deadly serious."" This video can not be played Prince Andrew: 'I don't remember this' Â© 2025 BBC.

""We are not three days now since Buckingham Palace confirmed all the details of the [Queen's] Platinum Jubilee and we have the prospect of this civil sex case against her second son in September,"" he says. Our correspondent says further public airing of the claims against the Duke of York - which he denies - make it ""very, very hard"" for him to have any sort of public role within the family. ""He clings on to his colonelship of the Grenadier Guards,"" says Witchell. ""I'll tell you this: the Grenadier Guards don't want him."" The Guards have not spoken publicly about the case, he notes, but ""behind the scenes, they are acutely embarrassed to have Prince Andrew as their colonel"".

She said she had accompanied the paedophile Jeffrey Epstein and his then girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell, to London in March 2001, where they met the Duke of York. ""Weâre having tea and Andrewâs talking about Fergie, which is his
ex-wife. And Ghislaineâs bad mouthing Fergieâ¦ It seemed like friends just
catching up,"" she said. Roberts alleged that they later accompanied the Duke to Tramp nightclub. âHe asked me to dance,"" Roberts recalled during the interview. ""He is the most hideous dancer Iâve ever
seenâ¦ and this guy was sweating all over meâ¦ But I knew I had to keep him happy
because thatâs what Jeffrey and Ghislaine would expect from me. ""In the car, Ghislaine tells me that I had to do for Andrew what I
do for Jeffrey. And that made me sick. I just didnât expect it from royalty,"" she said. She alleged that later that evening, she had sex with Prince Andrew upstairs at Maxwell's house in Belgravia, London. ""It was a wicked time in my life. It was a really scary time in my
lifeâ¦ I wasnât chained to a sink, but these powerful people were my chains,"" Giuffre said. The Duke of York has consistently denied the claims, saying: ""It didn't happen."" If you're just joining us, Prince Andrew has failed in a bid to get a civil sex assault case
against him thrown out. Here's a recap about what's happened, and what it is all about: Mark Stephens, a defamation and reputation expert, told the BBC earlier that the Duke of York now finds himself ""in the last chance saloon with the towels over the taps"" and has only bad options ahead of him. ""Judge Lewis Kaplan has thrown this judicial decision like a bomb at the heart of the Royal Family,"" he said. Stephens noted that Prince Andrew faced ""three pretty bad options"" - appeal, settle or allow the case to go on and start giving evidence. He warned that, regardless of which path his lawyers took next, the duke's credibility was at serious risk. ""The one thing he can do is to accept the responsibility, accept the blame and accept that he has to fall on his sword for the sake of the wider family."" This video can not be played Prince Andrew's options 'increasingly limited' after failing to get civil case thrown out Prince Andrew is the Queen's third child and second son â and was the first child to beborn to a reigning monarch for 103 years. He's now ninth in line to the throne. He was created the Duke of York on his marriage to Sarah Ferguson, who became Duchess of York, in 1986. They have two daughters â Beatrice and Eugenie. In March 1992 it was announced the duke and duchess were to separate. They divorced in 1996, though remain close and still live together in the duke's home near Windsor. The duke served for 22 years in the Royal Navy and saw active service in the Falklands War in 1982. He also served as a special trade representative for the UK government until 2011. Andrew stepped away from royal duties in 2019 after a BBC Newsnight interview about Virginia Giuffre's allegations and his former friendship with the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Dominic CascianiHome Affairs Correspondent The legal clock is now ticking in Virginia Giuffre v Prince Andrew - because Judge Lewis Kaplan has set an unambiguous timetable to keep things moving towards a trial in the autumn. In the coming days, he wants to know whether his Manhattan court will be asked to send formal requests to the UK for assistance from judges in London with obtaining evidence. This is a common procedure in some international cases - but it may get complicated and political, depending on what Ms Giuffre's team ask for. By mid-May he wants to know who the witnesses are going to be for each side. While all this is going on, Ms Giuffre's team will be pressing for the prince's lawyers to disclose evidence. Their current demands - detailed in court papers - include information about the medical condition 20 years ago that prevented him sweating  and, secondly, evidence that he went to Woking Pizza Express. He must comply with these requests, if the evidence exists. By mid-July, witnesses will have filed their depositions. This means a formal recording of their evidence, on oath, out of court. If Prince Andrew refuses to comply with that, Virginia Giuffre can seek an automatic judgment in her favour at the end  of that month. Prince Andrew with Jeffrey Epstein in New York's Central Park in 2010 Virginia Giuffre alleges she was trafficked to London by Jeffrey Epstein in2001, when she was 17, and forced into sex with Prince Andrew. He says this did not happen. Here's a timeline of the key events in this case: A former prosecutor for the Southern District of New York has told the BBC that the range of options facing Prince Andrew have narrowed significantly. Sarah Krisoff said that the Duke of York must now seriously consider trying to resolve this civil case before it advances to trial some time later this year.

of those claims"". Boies, 80, is the chairman and managing partner of the US law firm Boies, Schiller & Flexner, and represents several alleged victims of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. He has previously said up to six witnesses are willing to testify in the civil case against the Duke of York (who has consistently denied the allegations). Now faced with a civil lawsuit in the US, Prince Andrew's best option is to settle, our royal correspondent Jonny Dymond continues. ""The cool heads among the US legal profession are saying: he does not want to go through the process of trial. ""Just the process of the trial going forward will be immensely difficult for him to navigate and immensely challenging for his reputation.""

Giuffre 'pleased' she can take Prince Andrew to court,"A US woman, who accuses Prince Andrew of sexually assaulting her 20 years ago, has welcomed a judge's decision that she can take him to court Virginia Giuffre is suing the Queen's second son, saying he sexually assaulted her on three occasions when she was under the age of 18 Giuffre alleges that the duke's friends - convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein and sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell - lent her out for sex with wealthy and powerful associates, including the prince Andrew has constantly denied the allegations and attempted to get the case dismissed by a judge in New York His lawyers had argued in court that Giuffre waived her rights to sue him as part of a settlement with Epstein But Giuffre's team said only the parties of the settlement agreement could benefit from it, and not a ""third party"" In a 46-page decision, judge Lewis A Kaplan in New York said the agreement ""cannot be said"" to benefit Prince Andrew Edited by Claudia Allen That's all from the live team for this evening - thank you for joining us. These updates were written by Matt Murphy, James McFadden and Nathan Williams in London and Holly Honderich and Sam Cabral in the US. The page was edited by Thom Poole and Claudia Allen. We're now pausing our live coverage of Virginia Giuffre's civil suit against the Queen's second son, Prince Andrew. Giuffre, now 38, says the prince sexually assaulted her on three occasions beginning in March 2001 when she was 17. He has denied all allegations against him and said that he does not recall ever meeting her. US district Judge Lewis A Kaplan ruled on Wednesday that Giuffre could move forward with her sex abuse suit against the Duke of York. Judge Kaplan rejected arguments by the prince that he was protected by a 2009 plea agreement between Giuffre and Jeffrey Epstein, which bars Giuffre from pursuing litigation against Epstein and anyone who could be a ""potential defendant"". Prince Andrew now faces three choices: head to court, appeal the decision, or reach a legal settlement with Giuffre. Experts say none of the options are good ones for the prince. The clock is already ticking for the Duke of York. Aiming for an autumn trial, Giuffre's lawyers will soon begin seeking evidence from his legal team. A lawyer for Giuffre said she was ""pleased"" by the ruling and that she looks forward to pursuing her case in court. Buckingham Palace declined to comment on the ""ongoing legal matter"". Prince Andrew gave a key interview to BBC Newsnight's Emily Maitlis in November 2019, in which he ""categorically"" denied having any sexual contact with Virginia Giuffre. Maitlis has since written about the moment she sat down in a Buckingham Palace ballroomposing questions that ""seemed almost too surreal to ask"". In an earlier meeting with the prince, prepping for the interview, he had ""volunteered the information to me in that early meeting that he was 'unable to sweat'"", she says. Virginia Giuffre had alleged she had danced with a sweating Prince Andrew in a London club. The royal was also asked to explain his whereabouts on the night Giuffre alleged he had danced with her. ""His office had checked the date, and told us he couldn't have been with her because he had been at a children's birthday party that same evening."" In the interview, the prince said the party had taken place at a Pizza Express in Woking. Giuffre's legal teamhas since asked for proof of the duke's alleged inability to sweat. It was an interview that grabbed the attention of the world, and led to the Duke of York stepping back from public life. For the BBC's 5 Minutes On, Emily Maitlis describes the 2019 interview and how it might play a crucial role in what happens next to the prince. This video can not be played Prince Andrew fails to get US civil case dismissed. Virginia Giuffre with her lawyer David Boies (right) Virginia Giuffre's lawyers are pleased at the ruling out of New York. In a statement, Sigrid McCawley wrote: âTodayâs decision by Judge Kaplan denying Prince Andrewâs effort to dismiss Virginia Giuffreâs case against him is another important step in Virginiaâs heroic and determined pursuit of justice as a survivor of sex trafficking."" Earlier, we reported that McCawley's co-counsel David Boies said Giuffre was ""pleased"" the Duke of York's motion had been denied and she ""looks forward"" to bringing her case in court. Neither the prince nor his lawyers have made a statement in response to today's decision. The duke has vigorously denied Giuffre's allegations against him. More now on the details of today's legal ruling by a New York judge. Judge Kaplan, as part of his ruling, addressed an argument by Prince
Andrewâs legal team that a New York state law giving victims of child sexual abuse more time to sue is âunconstitutional"". The state's Child Victimâs Act allows such victims to sue until they turn 55 years
old, giving those who suffered decades-old abuse a chance to seek justice. Prince
Andrew's lawyers said that while the law allowed survivors to sue for abuses
they suffered before they were 18 years old, the age of consent in New York is
17. That's the age Ms Giuffre was when she says she was abused by the royal (allegations he denies). Judge
Kaplan said Prince Andrew is not the first person to try and use this argument in
court, but it has been ârejected by every New York state and federal court to
have encountered it.â He adds: âIt
has been rejected repeatedly for good reason.â Read more about the Child Victimâs Act. Melissa Murray, a professor of law at New York University, says that allowing the allegations against Prince Andrew to advance to a civil trial in a New York court could be ""embarrassing to the monarchy"". But Prof Murray also warned that pursuing a settlement with Virginia Giuffre outside of court would be widely viewed as an implicit admission of wrongdoing on the Duke's part - which he has always strenuously denied. This video can not be played Prof Melissa Murray says a trial would be ""embarrassing to the monarchy"" Prince Andrew's lawyers had argued that Virginia Giuffre was prevented from pursuing her civil case against him due to a legal settlement she'd reached with Jeffrey Epstein in 2009. A clause in that agreement blocked future cases against Epstein and anyone else who could be a ""potential defendant"". But in his verdict, Judge Lewis A Kaplan said that the agreement, ""whatever it was intended to mean, is riddled with drafting problems and ambiguitiesâ. He added that the clause is far too broad and that it is unclear who exactly it is intended to cover. Judge Kaplan also said that an agreement must leave no reasonable doubt about the intent of the contracting parties and said that where such ambiguity exists it ""must be resolved byâ¦ a trial jury"". He told the duke's lawyers that the court cannot ""resolve any such
ambiguity on a motion to dismiss the complaint."" Prince Andrew has consistently denied Ms Giuffre's claims. A 2001 photo of Prince Andrew with Virginia Giuffre and Ghislaine Maxwell Prince Andrew has said he has ""no recollection"" of ever meeting Virginia Giuffre. Giuffre claims she was forced to have sex with the Duke of York on three occasions - in London, New York and on a private Caribbean island owned by late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein - between 2001 and 2002, beginning when she was 17. An infamous photo of the two together, with the prince's arm around Giuffre's waist, is what she says proves that first meeting in March 2001. Also in the frame is a smiling Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's former girlfriend and business associate, now convicted of trafficking girls for him to abuse. The photo is said to have been taken by Epstein himself inside the Belgravia townhouse belonging to Maxwell. Of the photo, the prince has suggested it may well have been doctored, adding that ""hug[s] and public displays of affection are not something that I do"". While Giuffre alleges they went to a nightclub and had sex at Maxwell's home later that evening, Prince Andrew insists he was actually with his daughter at a Pizza Express restaurant in the town of Woking, near London, on that day. BBC royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell says today's ruling in New York is ""a monumental mess"" for the Royal Family.

ambiguity on a motion to dismiss the complaint."" Prince Andrew has consistently denied Ms Giuffre's claims. A 2001 photo of Prince Andrew with Virginia Giuffre and Ghislaine Maxwell Prince Andrew has said he has ""no recollection"" of ever meeting Virginia Giuffre. Giuffre claims she was forced to have sex with the Duke of York on three occasions - in London, New York and on a private Caribbean island owned by late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein - between 2001 and 2002, beginning when she was 17. An infamous photo of the two together, with the prince's arm around Giuffre's waist, is what she says proves that first meeting in March 2001. Also in the frame is a smiling Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's former girlfriend and business associate, now convicted of trafficking girls for him to abuse. The photo is said to have been taken by Epstein himself inside the Belgravia townhouse belonging to Maxwell. Of the photo, the prince has suggested it may well have been doctored, adding that ""hug[s] and public displays of affection are not something that I do"". While Giuffre alleges they went to a nightclub and had sex at Maxwell's home later that evening, Prince Andrew insists he was actually with his daughter at a Pizza Express restaurant in the town of Woking, near London, on that day. BBC royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell says today's ruling in New York is ""a monumental mess"" for the Royal Family. ""We are not three days now since Buckingham Palace confirmed all the details of the [Queen's] Platinum Jubilee and we have the prospect of this civil sex case against her second son in September,"" he says. Our correspondent says further public airing of the claims against the Duke of York - which he denies - make it ""very, very hard"" for him to have any sort of public role within the family. ""He clings on to his colonelship of the Grenadier Guards,"" says Witchell. ""I'll tell you this: the Grenadier Guards don't want him."" The Guards have not spoken publicly about the case, he notes, but ""behind the scenes, they are acutely embarrassed to have Prince Andrew as their colonel"". This video can not be played Prince Andrew case 'a monumental mess' This video can not be played Virginia Giuffre on Prince Andrew: 'I knew I had to keep him happy' Back in 2019, Virginia Giuffre told BBC Panorama that she had been brought to Britain aged 17 to have sex with Prince Andrew and implored the British public to ""stand beside her"". She said she had accompanied the paedophile Jeffrey Epstein and his then girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell, to London in March 2001, where they met the Duke of York. ""Weâre having tea and Andrewâs talking about Fergie, which is his
ex-wife. And Ghislaineâs bad mouthing Fergieâ¦ It seemed like friends just
catching up,"" she said. Roberts alleged that they later accompanied the Duke to Tramp nightclub. âHe asked me to dance,"" Roberts recalled during the interview. ""He is the most hideous dancer Iâve ever
seenâ¦ and this guy was sweating all over meâ¦ But I knew I had to keep him happy
because thatâs what Jeffrey and Ghislaine would expect from me. ""In the car, Ghislaine tells me that I had to do for Andrew what I
do for Jeffrey. And that made me sick. I just didnât expect it from royalty,"" she said. She alleged that later that evening, she had sex with Prince Andrew upstairs at Maxwell's house in Belgravia, London. ""It was a wicked time in my life. It was a really scary time in my
lifeâ¦ I wasnât chained to a sink, but these powerful people were my chains,"" Giuffre said. The Duke of York has consistently denied the claims, saying: ""It didn't happen."" If you're just joining us, Prince Andrew has failed in a bid to get a civil sex assault case
against him thrown out. Here's a recap about what's happened, and what it is all about: Mark Stephens, a defamation and reputation expert, told the BBC earlier that the Duke of York now finds himself ""in the last chance saloon with the towels over the taps"" and has only bad options ahead of him. ""Judge Lewis Kaplan has thrown this judicial decision like a bomb at the heart of the Royal Family,"" he said. Stephens noted that Prince Andrew faced ""three pretty bad options"" - appeal, settle or allow the case to go on and start giving evidence. He warned that, regardless of which path his lawyers took next, the duke's credibility was at serious risk. ""The one thing he can do is to accept the responsibility, accept the blame and accept that he has to fall on his sword for the sake of the wider family."" This video can not be played Prince Andrew's options 'increasingly limited' after failing to get civil case thrown out Prince Andrew is the Queen's third child and second son â and was the first child to beborn to a reigning monarch for 103 years. He's now ninth in line to the throne. He was created the Duke of York on his marriage to Sarah Ferguson, who became Duchess of York, in 1986. They have two daughters â Beatrice and Eugenie. In March 1992 it was announced the duke and duchess were to separate. They divorced in 1996, though remain close and still live together in the duke's home near Windsor. The duke served for 22 years in the Royal Navy and saw active service in the Falklands War in 1982. He also served as a special trade representative for the UK government until 2011. Andrew stepped away from royal duties in 2019 after a BBC Newsnight interview about Virginia Giuffre's allegations and his former friendship with the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Dominic CascianiHome Affairs Correspondent The legal clock is now ticking in Virginia Giuffre v Prince Andrew - because Judge Lewis Kaplan has set an unambiguous timetable to keep things moving towards a trial in the autumn. In the coming days, he wants to know whether his Manhattan court will be asked to send formal requests to the UK for assistance from judges in London with obtaining evidence. This is a common procedure in some international cases - but it may get complicated and political, depending on what Ms Giuffre's team ask for. By mid-May he wants to know who the witnesses are going to be for each side. While all this is going on, Ms Giuffre's team will be pressing for the prince's lawyers to disclose evidence. Their current demands - detailed in court papers - include information about the medical condition 20 years ago that prevented him sweating  and, secondly, evidence that he went to Woking Pizza Express. He must comply with these requests, if the evidence exists. By mid-July, witnesses will have filed their depositions. This means a formal recording of their evidence, on oath, out of court. If Prince Andrew refuses to comply with that, Virginia Giuffre can seek an automatic judgment in her favour at the end  of that month. Prince Andrew with Jeffrey Epstein in New York's Central Park in 2010 Virginia Giuffre alleges she was trafficked to London by Jeffrey Epstein in2001, when she was 17, and forced into sex with Prince Andrew. He says this did not happen. Here's a timeline of the key events in this case: A former prosecutor for the Southern District of New York has told the BBC that the range of options facing Prince Andrew have narrowed significantly. Sarah Krisoff said that the Duke of York must now seriously consider trying to resolve this civil case before it advances to trial some time later this year. This video can not be played Sarah Krisoff spoke to the BBC about the latest in the allegations against Prince Andrew. Virginia Giuffre's lawyer says she is ""pleased that Prince Andrewâs motion to
dismiss has been denied, and that evidence will now be taken concerning her
claims against him"". In a statement released a short while ago, David Boies adds that his client ""looks forward to a judicial determination of the merits
of those claims"". Boies, 80, is the chairman and managing partner of the US law firm Boies, Schiller & Flexner, and represents several alleged victims of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. He has previously said up to six witnesses are willing to testify in the civil case against the Duke of York (who has consistently denied the allegations). Now faced with a civil lawsuit in the US, Prince Andrew's best option is to settle, our royal correspondent Jonny Dymond continues. ""The cool heads among the US legal profession are saying: he does not want to go through the process of trial. ""Just the process of the trial going forward will be immensely difficult for him to navigate and immensely challenging for his reputation."" But crucially Virginia Guiffre must also agree to a settlement for the duke to avoid a courtroom drama. If the civil case does go forward, and Prince Andrew is compelled to appear in a US courtroom ""it would be one of the most astonishing moments in the royal familyâs modern history"", Dymond says. âWe are in strange territory now for the Queenâs second son.â Virginia Giuffre, then Roberts, was pictured with Prince Andrew in London in 2001 BBC royal correspondent Jonny Dymond says today's ruling in New York is ""a disastrous result"" for the Duke of York and ""very serious for the reputation"" of the royals. ""The Royal Family as an institution would love to see this case go away but it is not going away,"" he says. Our correspondent says Prince Andrew may have expected the 2009 deal struck between his accuser Virginia Giuffre and Jeffrey Epstein to be his ""get-out-of-jail-free card"" but the family will now likely endure ""six to 10 months of embarrassment"". ""There is the possibility of an appeal, but it's really slim,"" he notes. ""And the machinery of this case continues while that appeal goes on."" He adds: ""Even if Prince Andrew stays in England, there is a mechanism to enforce him giving testimony in a deposition for a US trial. His legal options are narrowing day by day."" Let's look back now at the interview the Duke of York gave to BBC Newsnight more than two years ago. He came to clear his name folllowing the Giuffre allegations. He believed things had been said about him that he could disprove. And he had his defence ready. ""The point of the interview was just to have a record of Prince Andrew's own version of events. He wanted to set his own record straight,""writes the BBC's Emily Maitlis, who interviewed the royal. Maitlis says the answers Prince Andrew gave - about a birthday party in Woking, a trip to Pizza Express, and his inability to sweat - then ""seemed almost comical"".

These updates were written by Matt Murphy, James McFadden and Nathan Williams in London and Holly Honderich and Sam Cabral in the US. The page was edited by Thom Poole and Claudia Allen. We're now pausing our live coverage of Virginia Giuffre's civil suit against the Queen's second son, Prince Andrew. Giuffre, now 38, says the prince sexually assaulted her on three occasions beginning in March 2001 when she was 17. He has denied all allegations against him and said that he does not recall ever meeting her. US district Judge Lewis A Kaplan ruled on Wednesday that Giuffre could move forward with her sex abuse suit against the Duke of York. Judge Kaplan rejected arguments by the prince that he was protected by a 2009 plea agreement between Giuffre and Jeffrey Epstein, which bars Giuffre from pursuing litigation against Epstein and anyone who could be a ""potential defendant"". Prince Andrew now faces three choices: head to court, appeal the decision, or reach a legal settlement with Giuffre. Experts say none of the options are good ones for the prince. The clock is already ticking for the Duke of York. Aiming for an autumn trial, Giuffre's lawyers will soon begin seeking evidence from his legal team. A lawyer for Giuffre said she was ""pleased"" by the ruling and that she looks forward to pursuing her case in court. Buckingham Palace declined to comment on the ""ongoing legal matter"". Prince Andrew gave a key interview to BBC Newsnight's Emily Maitlis in November 2019, in which he ""categorically"" denied having any sexual contact with Virginia Giuffre. Maitlis has since written about the moment she sat down in a Buckingham Palace ballroomposing questions that ""seemed almost too surreal to ask"". In an earlier meeting with the prince, prepping for the interview, he had ""volunteered the information to me in that early meeting that he was 'unable to sweat'"", she says. Virginia Giuffre had alleged she had danced with a sweating Prince Andrew in a London club. The royal was also asked to explain his whereabouts on the night Giuffre alleged he had danced with her. ""His office had checked the date, and told us he couldn't have been with her because he had been at a children's birthday party that same evening."" In the interview, the prince said the party had taken place at a Pizza Express in Woking. Giuffre's legal teamhas since asked for proof of the duke's alleged inability to sweat. It was an interview that grabbed the attention of the world, and led to the Duke of York stepping back from public life. For the BBC's 5 Minutes On, Emily Maitlis describes the 2019 interview and how it might play a crucial role in what happens next to the prince. This video can not be played Prince Andrew fails to get US civil case dismissed. Virginia Giuffre with her lawyer David Boies (right) Virginia Giuffre's lawyers are pleased at the ruling out of New York. In a statement, Sigrid McCawley wrote: âTodayâs decision by Judge Kaplan denying Prince Andrewâs effort to dismiss Virginia Giuffreâs case against him is another important step in Virginiaâs heroic and determined pursuit of justice as a survivor of sex trafficking."" Earlier, we reported that McCawley's co-counsel David Boies said Giuffre was ""pleased"" the Duke of York's motion had been denied and she ""looks forward"" to bringing her case in court. Neither the prince nor his lawyers have made a statement in response to today's decision. The duke has vigorously denied Giuffre's allegations against him. More now on the details of today's legal ruling by a New York judge. Judge Kaplan, as part of his ruling, addressed an argument by Prince
Andrewâs legal team that a New York state law giving victims of child sexual abuse more time to sue is âunconstitutional"". The state's Child Victimâs Act allows such victims to sue until they turn 55 years
old, giving those who suffered decades-old abuse a chance to seek justice. Prince
Andrew's lawyers said that while the law allowed survivors to sue for abuses
they suffered before they were 18 years old, the age of consent in New York is
17. That's the age Ms Giuffre was when she says she was abused by the royal (allegations he denies). Judge
Kaplan said Prince Andrew is not the first person to try and use this argument in
court, but it has been ârejected by every New York state and federal court to
have encountered it.â He adds: âIt
has been rejected repeatedly for good reason.â Read more about the Child Victimâs Act. Melissa Murray, a professor of law at New York University, says that allowing the allegations against Prince Andrew to advance to a civil trial in a New York court could be ""embarrassing to the monarchy"". But Prof Murray also warned that pursuing a settlement with Virginia Giuffre outside of court would be widely viewed as an implicit admission of wrongdoing on the Duke's part - which he has always strenuously denied. This video can not be played Prof Melissa Murray says a trial would be ""embarrassing to the monarchy"" Prince Andrew's lawyers had argued that Virginia Giuffre was prevented from pursuing her civil case against him due to a legal settlement she'd reached with Jeffrey Epstein in 2009. A clause in that agreement blocked future cases against Epstein and anyone else who could be a ""potential defendant"". But in his verdict, Judge Lewis A Kaplan said that the agreement, ""whatever it was intended to mean, is riddled with drafting problems and ambiguitiesâ. He added that the clause is far too broad and that it is unclear who exactly it is intended to cover. Judge Kaplan also said that an agreement must leave no reasonable doubt about the intent of the contracting parties and said that where such ambiguity exists it ""must be resolved byâ¦ a trial jury"". He told the duke's lawyers that the court cannot ""resolve any such
ambiguity on a motion to dismiss the complaint."" Prince Andrew has consistently denied Ms Giuffre's claims.

Andrew's lawyers said that while the law allowed survivors to sue for abuses
they suffered before they were 18 years old, the age of consent in New York is
17. That's the age Ms Giuffre was when she says she was abused by the royal (allegations he denies). Judge
Kaplan said Prince Andrew is not the first person to try and use this argument in
court, but it has been ârejected by every New York state and federal court to
have encountered it.â He adds: âIt
has been rejected repeatedly for good reason.â Read more about the Child Victimâs Act. Melissa Murray, a professor of law at New York University, says that allowing the allegations against Prince Andrew to advance to a civil trial in a New York court could be ""embarrassing to the monarchy"". But Prof Murray also warned that pursuing a settlement with Virginia Giuffre outside of court would be widely viewed as an implicit admission of wrongdoing on the Duke's part - which he has always strenuously denied. This video can not be played Prof Melissa Murray says a trial would be ""embarrassing to the monarchy"" Prince Andrew's lawyers had argued that Virginia Giuffre was prevented from pursuing her civil case against him due to a legal settlement she'd reached with Jeffrey Epstein in 2009. A clause in that agreement blocked future cases against Epstein and anyone else who could be a ""potential defendant"". But in his verdict, Judge Lewis A Kaplan said that the agreement, ""whatever it was intended to mean, is riddled with drafting problems and ambiguitiesâ. He added that the clause is far too broad and that it is unclear who exactly it is intended to cover. Judge Kaplan also said that an agreement must leave no reasonable doubt about the intent of the contracting parties and said that where such ambiguity exists it ""must be resolved byâ¦ a trial jury"". He told the duke's lawyers that the court cannot ""resolve any such
ambiguity on a motion to dismiss the complaint."" Prince Andrew has consistently denied Ms Giuffre's claims. A 2001 photo of Prince Andrew with Virginia Giuffre and Ghislaine Maxwell Prince Andrew has said he has ""no recollection"" of ever meeting Virginia Giuffre. Giuffre claims she was forced to have sex with the Duke of York on three occasions - in London, New York and on a private Caribbean island owned by late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein - between 2001 and 2002, beginning when she was 17. An infamous photo of the two together, with the prince's arm around Giuffre's waist, is what she says proves that first meeting in March 2001. Also in the frame is a smiling Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's former girlfriend and business associate, now convicted of trafficking girls for him to abuse. The photo is said to have been taken by Epstein himself inside the Belgravia townhouse belonging to Maxwell. Of the photo, the prince has suggested it may well have been doctored, adding that ""hug[s] and public displays of affection are not something that I do"". While Giuffre alleges they went to a nightclub and had sex at Maxwell's home later that evening, Prince Andrew insists he was actually with his daughter at a Pizza Express restaurant in the town of Woking, near London, on that day. BBC royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell says today's ruling in New York is ""a monumental mess"" for the Royal Family. ""We are not three days now since Buckingham Palace confirmed all the details of the [Queen's] Platinum Jubilee and we have the prospect of this civil sex case against her second son in September,"" he says. Our correspondent says further public airing of the claims against the Duke of York - which he denies - make it ""very, very hard"" for him to have any sort of public role within the family. ""He clings on to his colonelship of the Grenadier Guards,"" says Witchell. ""I'll tell you this: the Grenadier Guards don't want him."" The Guards have not spoken publicly about the case, he notes, but ""behind the scenes, they are acutely embarrassed to have Prince Andrew as their colonel"". This video can not be played Prince Andrew case 'a monumental mess' This video can not be played Virginia Giuffre on Prince Andrew: 'I knew I had to keep him happy' Back in 2019, Virginia Giuffre told BBC Panorama that she had been brought to Britain aged 17 to have sex with Prince Andrew and implored the British public to ""stand beside her"". She said she had accompanied the paedophile Jeffrey Epstein and his then girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell, to London in March 2001, where they met the Duke of York. ""Weâre having tea and Andrewâs talking about Fergie, which is his
ex-wife. And Ghislaineâs bad mouthing Fergieâ¦ It seemed like friends just
catching up,"" she said. Roberts alleged that they later accompanied the Duke to Tramp nightclub. âHe asked me to dance,"" Roberts recalled during the interview. ""He is the most hideous dancer Iâve ever
seenâ¦ and this guy was sweating all over meâ¦ But I knew I had to keep him happy
because thatâs what Jeffrey and Ghislaine would expect from me. ""In the car, Ghislaine tells me that I had to do for Andrew what I
do for Jeffrey. And that made me sick. I just didnât expect it from royalty,"" she said. She alleged that later that evening, she had sex with Prince Andrew upstairs at Maxwell's house in Belgravia, London. ""It was a wicked time in my life. It was a really scary time in my
lifeâ¦ I wasnât chained to a sink, but these powerful people were my chains,"" Giuffre said. The Duke of York has consistently denied the claims, saying: ""It didn't happen."" If you're just joining us, Prince Andrew has failed in a bid to get a civil sex assault case
against him thrown out. Here's a recap about what's happened, and what it is all about: Mark Stephens, a defamation and reputation expert, told the BBC earlier that the Duke of York now finds himself ""in the last chance saloon with the towels over the taps"" and has only bad options ahead of him. ""Judge Lewis Kaplan has thrown this judicial decision like a bomb at the heart of the Royal Family,"" he said. Stephens noted that Prince Andrew faced ""three pretty bad options"" - appeal, settle or allow the case to go on and start giving evidence. He warned that, regardless of which path his lawyers took next, the duke's credibility was at serious risk. ""The one thing he can do is to accept the responsibility, accept the blame and accept that he has to fall on his sword for the sake of the wider family."" This video can not be played Prince Andrew's options 'increasingly limited' after failing to get civil case thrown out Prince Andrew is the Queen's third child and second son â and was the first child to beborn to a reigning monarch for 103 years. He's now ninth in line to the throne. He was created the Duke of York on his marriage to Sarah Ferguson, who became Duchess of York, in 1986. They have two daughters â Beatrice and Eugenie. In March 1992 it was announced the duke and duchess were to separate. They divorced in 1996, though remain close and still live together in the duke's home near Windsor. The duke served for 22 years in the Royal Navy and saw active service in the Falklands War in 1982. He also served as a special trade representative for the UK government until 2011. Andrew stepped away from royal duties in 2019 after a BBC Newsnight interview about Virginia Giuffre's allegations and his former friendship with the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Dominic CascianiHome Affairs Correspondent The legal clock is now ticking in Virginia Giuffre v Prince Andrew - because Judge Lewis Kaplan has set an unambiguous timetable to keep things moving towards a trial in the autumn. In the coming days, he wants to know whether his Manhattan court will be asked to send formal requests to the UK for assistance from judges in London with obtaining evidence. This is a common procedure in some international cases - but it may get complicated and political, depending on what Ms Giuffre's team ask for. By mid-May he wants to know who the witnesses are going to be for each side. While all this is going on, Ms Giuffre's team will be pressing for the prince's lawyers to disclose evidence. Their current demands - detailed in court papers - include information about the medical condition 20 years ago that prevented him sweating  and, secondly, evidence that he went to Woking Pizza Express. He must comply with these requests, if the evidence exists. By mid-July, witnesses will have filed their depositions. This means a formal recording of their evidence, on oath, out of court. If Prince Andrew refuses to comply with that, Virginia Giuffre can seek an automatic judgment in her favour at the end  of that month. Prince Andrew with Jeffrey Epstein in New York's Central Park in 2010 Virginia Giuffre alleges she was trafficked to London by Jeffrey Epstein in2001, when she was 17, and forced into sex with Prince Andrew. He says this did not happen. Here's a timeline of the key events in this case: A former prosecutor for the Southern District of New York has told the BBC that the range of options facing Prince Andrew have narrowed significantly. Sarah Krisoff said that the Duke of York must now seriously consider trying to resolve this civil case before it advances to trial some time later this year. This video can not be played Sarah Krisoff spoke to the BBC about the latest in the allegations against Prince Andrew. Virginia Giuffre's lawyer says she is ""pleased that Prince Andrewâs motion to
dismiss has been denied, and that evidence will now be taken concerning her
claims against him"". In a statement released a short while ago, David Boies adds that his client ""looks forward to a judicial determination of the merits
of those claims"". Boies, 80, is the chairman and managing partner of the US law firm Boies, Schiller & Flexner, and represents several alleged victims of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. He has previously said up to six witnesses are willing to testify in the civil case against the Duke of York (who has consistently denied the allegations). Now faced with a civil lawsuit in the US, Prince Andrew's best option is to settle, our royal correspondent Jonny Dymond continues. ""The cool heads among the US legal profession are saying: he does not want to go through the process of trial. ""Just the process of the trial going forward will be immensely difficult for him to navigate and immensely challenging for his reputation."" But crucially Virginia Guiffre must also agree to a settlement for the duke to avoid a courtroom drama. If the civil case does go forward, and Prince Andrew is compelled to appear in a US courtroom ""it would be one of the most astonishing moments in the royal familyâs modern history"", Dymond says. âWe are in strange territory now for the Queenâs second son.â Virginia Giuffre, then Roberts, was pictured with Prince Andrew in London in 2001 BBC royal correspondent Jonny Dymond says today's ruling in New York is ""a disastrous result"" for the Duke of York and ""very serious for the reputation"" of the royals. ""The Royal Family as an institution would love to see this case go away but it is not going away,"" he says. Our correspondent says Prince Andrew may have expected the 2009 deal struck between his accuser Virginia Giuffre and Jeffrey Epstein to be his ""get-out-of-jail-free card"" but the family will now likely endure ""six to 10 months of embarrassment"". ""There is the possibility of an appeal, but it's really slim,"" he notes. ""And the machinery of this case continues while that appeal goes on."" He adds: ""Even if Prince Andrew stays in England, there is a mechanism to enforce him giving testimony in a deposition for a US trial. His legal options are narrowing day by day."" Let's look back now at the interview the Duke of York gave to BBC Newsnight more than two years ago. He came to clear his name folllowing the Giuffre allegations. He believed things had been said about him that he could disprove. And he had his defence ready. ""The point of the interview was just to have a record of Prince Andrew's own version of events. He wanted to set his own record straight,""writes the BBC's Emily Maitlis, who interviewed the royal. Maitlis says the answers Prince Andrew gave - about a birthday party in Woking, a trip to Pizza Express, and his inability to sweat - then ""seemed almost comical"". ""But now suddenly, they feel deadly serious."" This video can not be played Prince Andrew: 'I don't remember this' Â© 2025 BBC.

Armed stand-off forcing businesses to close doors,"Earlsdon Primary School has been closed since Monday because of the stand-off A school remains closed, a library is given over to police use and businesses are shut as an armed stand-off continues into a fourth day. A 41-year-old man barricaded himself in a flat in Coventry with his eight-year-old son on Sunday. It is believed there are weapons in the property on Earlsdon Avenue North amid what police describe as a really sensitive policing operation. Safety is the main concern, West Midlands Police said. Residents said they had been getting calls from friends and family concerned for their welfare. Stuart Taylor, who has a butcher's business on nearby Newcombe Road, said he had been forced to close his doors and was trying to get deliveries to his regular customers, with the assistance of the police. He said, it is not the end of the world but he is worried about the impact on the community if the stand-off continues. ""It can't carry on like this,"" he said. ""Some people can't even get to their own houses and have been told to contact homeless shelter if they can't find somewhere to stay."" He also said he was concerned about the cost of the ongoing police operation. One couple, who have lived in the area for more than 30 years, said normally things were quiet. A woman, who did not give her name, said: ""In the daytime it's like a village really, everybody knows each other. ""I'm in a book group in the library and we were due to meet tomorrow evening, but clearly the library is being used as a sort of rest station for the police."" Armed officers have been outside the property since Sunday Supt Ronan Tyrer said the safety of all involved was of ""prime importance"" West Midlands Police said armed response officers remained outside the property and specialist negotiators were continuing to speak to the man in an effort to bring the situation to a safe conclusion. Supt Ronan Tyrer said on Wednesday: ""I appreciate for residents, but for also the wider community, including those parents of children at Earlsdon Primary School, that it is incredibly frustrating. ""What I will say is that this is a really sensitive policing operation."" And he added: ""We have to have the cordons in place and we are working incredibly hard to bring to a conclusion swiftly, but of prime importance safely, this incident."" He also said that while it was a ""significant policing response"" the operation had not affected ""overall resourcing levels."" Are you in the area?  Is there any information you'd like to share?

"Nightclubs still waiting for Covid funding supportGrants for clubs - closed under Covid rules last year - have still not been paid, the industry says.ScotlandComments","Nightclub owners have criticised the slow rollout of financial support for their businesses, which have been closed again under Covid restrictions. Clubs have been closed since 27 December withNicola Sturgeon announcing the shutdown will remain in place until at least 24 January. But trade groups said Scottish government funding promised before Christmas has not yet materialised. Deputy First Minister John Swinney said the grants will be paid ""very soon"". Restrictions on large outdoor events in Scotland, including football matches and concerts, are to be lifted from next Monday. But limits on indoor events and venues will remain in place for at least another week as part of a phased approach to lifting measures brought in to help deal with a surge in Covid cases caused by the Omicron variant. Scotland's nightclubs to close for three weeks from 27 December Nightclubs close and 1m distancing returns Restrictions on large outdoor events in Scotland lifted Gavin Stevenson, vice-chairman of the Night Time Industries Association Scotland (NTIAS) and director of the Mor-Rioghain Group of hospitality venues, toldBBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme: ""As of today not a single penny of the funds promised before Christmas have reached businesses. ""It is putting businesses in an incredibly difficult situation, wondering how on earth they are going to pay their staff this week when they've got no money in the bank because they have been forced to close or trade is unviable by the current round of restrictions."" Mr Stevenson claimed the forms for the Scottish government's nightclub closure fund had not been issued yet, adding this is putting business owners and their staff ""in an untenable position"". Confetti raining down on people queueing outside the Buff Club in Glasgow which is among the venues affected by lengthy periods of closure over the last two years required by Covid rules Deputy First Minister John Swinney told Good Morning Scotland that the funding issue ""has got the attention of ministers"". He added: ""We're moving as quickly as we possibly can do to make the financial support available to the sectors which have been affected by the restrictions. ""We work closely with local authorities to make sure such funding arrangements can be put in place. ""The timescale should be very soon, it's difficult to give a precise timescale but I would think within the next two weeks would be a reasonable expectation."" Mr Swinney said the delay was partly down to setting up the payment process and the public holidays over the Christmas period. The government's nightclub closure fund allows venues to apply for a grant up to Â£55,000. Other hospitality businesses have also spoken of the impact restrictions have had on trade. Restrictions were introduced for pubs, restaurants and other indoor public places on 27 December. Indoor hospitality and leisure venues have to ensure there is a one-metre distance between different groups of people, and table service is required where alcohol is served. Scott Mitchell, managing director of Surgeons Quarter, which runs a hotel and events business in Edinburgh, said it had lost Â£225,000 in sales due to cancellations of Christmas and Hogmanay events. He said: ""While we welcome the apparent mindset shift towards gearing up for living with the pandemic, the government simply isn't doing enough to save hospitality. ""The first minister is leaving the sector with support measures that are not fit for purpose and arbitrary restrictions that will result in countless lost jobs and livelihoods. ""The support we are receiving equates to roughly 3% of the sales we have lost, which are in excess of Â£225,000."" Dr Liz Cameron, chief executive of the Scottish Chambers of Commerce, added: ""Businesses urgently need the financial support promised to them to be delivered as quickly as possible and additional financial support is made available should restrictions remain in place any longer."" Scottish Conservative MSP Murdo Fraser said many hospitality businesses were struggling and needed urgent support. He continued: ""It's unacceptable that struggling businesses already on their knees as a result of Scottish government restrictions are still waiting to receive a penny in financial support - and are now being told it may be a further fortnight before they do so. ""Many of these businesses are in danger of going under, so every day counts."" Meanwhile, the Scottish government is also facing calls to end the outdoor restrictions earlier than Monday. Partick Thistle has said it faces ""significant financial impact"" as a result of crowd limits still being in place on Saturday. Indoor sports clubs have also questioned why they are still facing restrictions. RULES:What are the restrictions in Scotland?

These updates were written by Matt Murphy, James McFadden and Nathan Williams in London and Holly Honderich and Sam Cabral in the US. The page was edited by Thom Poole and Claudia Allen. We're now pausing our live coverage of Virginia Giuffre's civil suit against the Queen's second son, Prince Andrew. Giuffre, now 38, says the prince sexually assaulted her on three occasions beginning in March 2001 when she was 17. He has denied all allegations against him and said that he does not recall ever meeting her. US district Judge Lewis A Kaplan ruled on Wednesday that Giuffre could move forward with her sex abuse suit against the Duke of York. Judge Kaplan rejected arguments by the prince that he was protected by a 2009 plea agreement between Giuffre and Jeffrey Epstein, which bars Giuffre from pursuing litigation against Epstein and anyone who could be a ""potential defendant"". Prince Andrew now faces three choices: head to court, appeal the decision, or reach a legal settlement with Giuffre. Experts say none of the options are good ones for the prince. The clock is already ticking for the Duke of York. Aiming for an autumn trial, Giuffre's lawyers will soon begin seeking evidence from his legal team. A lawyer for Giuffre said she was ""pleased"" by the ruling and that she looks forward to pursuing her case in court. Buckingham Palace declined to comment on the ""ongoing legal matter"". Prince Andrew gave a key interview to BBC Newsnight's Emily Maitlis in November 2019, in which he ""categorically"" denied having any sexual contact with Virginia Giuffre. Maitlis has since written about the moment she sat down in a Buckingham Palace ballroomposing questions that ""seemed almost too surreal to ask"". In an earlier meeting with the prince, prepping for the interview, he had ""volunteered the information to me in that early meeting that he was 'unable to sweat'"", she says. Virginia Giuffre had alleged she had danced with a sweating Prince Andrew in a London club. The royal was also asked to explain his whereabouts on the night Giuffre alleged he had danced with her. ""His office had checked the date, and told us he couldn't have been with her because he had been at a children's birthday party that same evening."" In the interview, the prince said the party had taken place at a Pizza Express in Woking. Giuffre's legal teamhas since asked for proof of the duke's alleged inability to sweat. It was an interview that grabbed the attention of the world, and led to the Duke of York stepping back from public life. For the BBC's 5 Minutes On, Emily Maitlis describes the 2019 interview and how it might play a crucial role in what happens next to the prince. This video can not be played Prince Andrew fails to get US civil case dismissed. Virginia Giuffre with her lawyer David Boies (right) Virginia Giuffre's lawyers are pleased at the ruling out of New York. In a statement, Sigrid McCawley wrote: âTodayâs decision by Judge Kaplan denying Prince Andrewâs effort to dismiss Virginia Giuffreâs case against him is another important step in Virginiaâs heroic and determined pursuit of justice as a survivor of sex trafficking."" Earlier, we reported that McCawley's co-counsel David Boies said Giuffre was ""pleased"" the Duke of York's motion had been denied and she ""looks forward"" to bringing her case in court. Neither the prince nor his lawyers have made a statement in response to today's decision. The duke has vigorously denied Giuffre's allegations against him. More now on the details of today's legal ruling by a New York judge. Judge Kaplan, as part of his ruling, addressed an argument by Prince
Andrewâs legal team that a New York state law giving victims of child sexual abuse more time to sue is âunconstitutional"". The state's Child Victimâs Act allows such victims to sue until they turn 55 years
old, giving those who suffered decades-old abuse a chance to seek justice. Prince
Andrew's lawyers said that while the law allowed survivors to sue for abuses
they suffered before they were 18 years old, the age of consent in New York is
17. That's the age Ms Giuffre was when she says she was abused by the royal (allegations he denies). Judge
Kaplan said Prince Andrew is not the first person to try and use this argument in
court, but it has been ârejected by every New York state and federal court to

lifeâ¦ I wasnât chained to a sink, but these powerful people were my chains,"" Giuffre said. The Duke of York has consistently denied the claims, saying: ""It didn't happen."" If you're just joining us, Prince Andrew has failed in a bid to get a civil sex assault case

Here's a recap about what's happened, and what it is all about: Mark Stephens, a defamation and reputation expert, told the BBC earlier that the Duke of York now finds himself ""in the last chance saloon with the towels over the taps"" and has only bad options ahead of him. ""Judge Lewis Kaplan has thrown this judicial decision like a bomb at the heart of the Royal Family,"" he said. Stephens noted that Prince Andrew faced ""three pretty bad options"" - appeal, settle or allow the case to go on and start giving evidence. He warned that, regardless of which path his lawyers took next, the duke's credibility was at serious risk. ""The one thing he can do is to accept the responsibility, accept the blame and accept that he has to fall on his sword for the sake of the wider family.""

He's now ninth in line to the throne. He was created the Duke of York on his marriage to Sarah Ferguson, who became Duchess of York, in 1986. They have two daughters â Beatrice and Eugenie. In March 1992 it was announced the duke and duchess were to separate. They divorced in 1996, though remain close and still live together in the duke's home near Windsor. The duke served for 22 years in the Royal Navy and saw active service in the Falklands War in 1982. He also served as a special trade representative for the UK government until 2011. Andrew stepped away from royal duties in 2019 after a BBC Newsnight interview about Virginia Giuffre's allegations and his former friendship with the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Dominic CascianiHome Affairs Correspondent The legal clock is now ticking in Virginia Giuffre v Prince Andrew - because Judge Lewis Kaplan has set an unambiguous timetable to keep things moving towards a trial in the autumn. In the coming days, he wants to know whether his Manhattan court will be asked to send formal requests to the UK for assistance from judges in London with obtaining evidence. This is a common procedure in some international cases - but it may get complicated and political, depending on what Ms Giuffre's team ask for. By mid-May he wants to know who the witnesses are going to be for each side. While all this is going on, Ms Giuffre's team will be pressing for the prince's lawyers to disclose evidence. Their current demands - detailed in court papers - include information about the medical condition 20 years ago that prevented him sweating  and, secondly, evidence that he went to Woking Pizza Express. He must comply with these requests, if the evidence exists. By mid-July, witnesses will have filed their depositions. This means a formal recording of their evidence, on oath, out of court. If Prince Andrew refuses to comply with that, Virginia Giuffre can seek an automatic judgment in her favour at the end  of that month. Prince Andrew with Jeffrey Epstein in New York's Central Park in 2010 Virginia Giuffre alleges she was trafficked to London by Jeffrey Epstein in2001, when she was 17, and forced into sex with Prince Andrew. He says this did not happen. Here's a timeline of the key events in this case: A former prosecutor for the Southern District of New York has told the BBC that the range of options facing Prince Andrew have narrowed significantly. Sarah Krisoff said that the Duke of York must now seriously consider trying to resolve this civil case before it advances to trial some time later this year.

dismiss has been denied, and that evidence will now be taken concerning her

of those claims"". Boies, 80, is the chairman and managing partner of the US law firm Boies, Schiller & Flexner, and represents several alleged victims of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. He has previously said up to six witnesses are willing to testify in the civil case against the Duke of York (who has consistently denied the allegations). Now faced with a civil lawsuit in the US, Prince Andrew's best option is to settle, our royal correspondent Jonny Dymond continues. ""The cool heads among the US legal profession are saying: he does not want to go through the process of trial. ""Just the process of the trial going forward will be immensely difficult for him to navigate and immensely challenging for his reputation."" But crucially Virginia Guiffre must also agree to a settlement for the duke to avoid a courtroom drama. If the civil case does go forward, and Prince Andrew is compelled to appear in a US courtroom ""it would be one of the most astonishing moments in the royal familyâs modern history"", Dymond says. âWe are in strange territory now for the Queenâs second son.â Virginia Giuffre, then Roberts, was pictured with Prince Andrew in London in 2001 BBC royal correspondent Jonny Dymond says today's ruling in New York is ""a disastrous result"" for the Duke of York and ""very serious for the reputation"" of the royals.

People devote third of waking time to mobile apps,"People are spending a third of their waking time on mobile apps, research suggests People are spending an average of 4.8 hours a day on their mobile phones, according to app monitoring firm App Annie. In 2020, UK regulator Ofcom found similar amounts of time spent, although its research included watching TV. App Annie'sreport,externalindicates that apps were downloaded 230 billion times in 2021, while $170bn (Â£125bn) was spent. TikTok was the most downloaded app worldwide, with users spending 90% more time there compared to 2020. ""The big screen is slowly dying as mobile continues to break records in virtually every category - time spent, downloads and revenue,"" said chief executive of App Annie, Theodore Krantz. The monitoring firm predicted that, by the second half of this year, TikTok would surpass 1.5 billion monthly active users. The average time spent on mobile apps was four hours and 48 minutes, up 30% from 2019, App Annie's State of Mobile report indicated. This was calculated across ten markets, including India, Turkey, the US, Japan, Mexico, Singapore and Canada. Users in Brazil, Indonesia and South Korea surpassed five hours per day. Of that time, seven out of every 10 minutes was spent on social, photo and video apps, with TikTok leading the way, the report suggested. The mobile eco-system in general remains very healthy  - with two million new apps and games launched in 2021 and the number of apps earning more than $100m up by 20%, according to the report. YouTube was the most popular video streaming app worldwide, clocking up more than a million downloads in 60 different countries. Netflix came second in many regions. Mobile gaming also grew - with people spending $116bn on them. Particularly popular were what the report called hyper-casual games such as Hair Challenge, in which players have to avoid getting their hair cut, and Bridge Race, in which players collect bricks and build stairs. Some users have complained about the number of ads in such games but app advertising generally is doing extremely well, with global spend topping $295bn last year. This suggests that concerns that Apple's privacy crackdown would damage mobile advertising are proving unfounded. In its iOS 14.5 update last year, iPhone users were given the option to say 'no' to having their data collected by apps. More people were turning to mindfulness apps to help them relax Some of the trends spotted in the research reflected wider changes, especially in how the pandemic has altered the way people live. For instance, people were spending a lot of time in shopping apps - more than 100 billion hours globally, with Singapore, Indonesia and Brazil growing the fastest. There was also a huge growth of food and drink apps - such as UberEats and Grubhub. The number of sessions on such apps grew to 194 billion in 2021, according to the research - up 50% on the previous year. Health and fitness apps also saw growth, as the pandemic meant people couldn't always attend gyms or conduct group exercise classes. And reflecting greater emphasis on mental well-being, meditation apps such as Headspace and Calm proved popular - especially with young people, with the top five most downloaded seeing a 27% growth in 2021. Spending on dating apps surged past $4bn, a 95% increase since 2018. And countries with apps to help handle the Covid-19 crisis, whether vaccine passports or just information tracking, saw huge take-up. The NHS app used in England - where it acts as a record of vaccinations - was downloaded by 71% of the fully vaccinated population, while Malaysia's MySejahtera app saw 80% of this same demographic adding it to their phones.

Prince Andrew fails to get US civil case dismissed,"A US woman, who accuses Prince Andrew of sexually assaulting her 20 years ago, has welcomed a judge's decision that she can take him to court Virginia Giuffre is suing the Queen's second son, saying he sexually assaulted her on three occasions when she was under the age of 18 Giuffre alleges that the duke's friends - convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein and sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell - lent her out for sex with wealthy and powerful associates, including the prince Andrew has constantly denied the allegations and attempted to get the case dismissed by a judge in New York His lawyers had argued in court that Giuffre waived her rights to sue him as part of a settlement with Epstein But Giuffre's team said only the parties of the settlement agreement could benefit from it, and not a ""third party"" In a 46-page decision, judge Lewis A Kaplan in New York said the agreement ""cannot be said"" to benefit Prince Andrew Edited by Claudia Allen That's all from the live team for this evening - thank you for joining us. These updates were written by Matt Murphy, James McFadden and Nathan Williams in London and Holly Honderich and Sam Cabral in the US. The page was edited by Thom Poole and Claudia Allen. We're now pausing our live coverage of Virginia Giuffre's civil suit against the Queen's second son, Prince Andrew. Giuffre, now 38, says the prince sexually assaulted her on three occasions beginning in March 2001 when she was 17. He has denied all allegations against him and said that he does not recall ever meeting her. US district Judge Lewis A Kaplan ruled on Wednesday that Giuffre could move forward with her sex abuse suit against the Duke of York. Judge Kaplan rejected arguments by the prince that he was protected by a 2009 plea agreement between Giuffre and Jeffrey Epstein, which bars Giuffre from pursuing litigation against Epstein and anyone who could be a ""potential defendant"". Prince Andrew now faces three choices: head to court, appeal the decision, or reach a legal settlement with Giuffre. Experts say none of the options are good ones for the prince. The clock is already ticking for the Duke of York. Aiming for an autumn trial, Giuffre's lawyers will soon begin seeking evidence from his legal team. A lawyer for Giuffre said she was ""pleased"" by the ruling and that she looks forward to pursuing her case in court. Buckingham Palace declined to comment on the ""ongoing legal matter"". Prince Andrew gave a key interview to BBC Newsnight's Emily Maitlis in November 2019, in which he ""categorically"" denied having any sexual contact with Virginia Giuffre. Maitlis has since written about the moment she sat down in a Buckingham Palace ballroomposing questions that ""seemed almost too surreal to ask"". In an earlier meeting with the prince, prepping for the interview, he had ""volunteered the information to me in that early meeting that he was 'unable to sweat'"", she says. Virginia Giuffre had alleged she had danced with a sweating Prince Andrew in a London club. The royal was also asked to explain his whereabouts on the night Giuffre alleged he had danced with her. ""His office had checked the date, and told us he couldn't have been with her because he had been at a children's birthday party that same evening."" In the interview, the prince said the party had taken place at a Pizza Express in Woking. Giuffre's legal teamhas since asked for proof of the duke's alleged inability to sweat. It was an interview that grabbed the attention of the world, and led to the Duke of York stepping back from public life. For the BBC's 5 Minutes On, Emily Maitlis describes the 2019 interview and how it might play a crucial role in what happens next to the prince. This video can not be played Prince Andrew fails to get US civil case dismissed. Virginia Giuffre with her lawyer David Boies (right) Virginia Giuffre's lawyers are pleased at the ruling out of New York. In a statement, Sigrid McCawley wrote: âTodayâs decision by Judge Kaplan denying Prince Andrewâs effort to dismiss Virginia Giuffreâs case against him is another important step in Virginiaâs heroic and determined pursuit of justice as a survivor of sex trafficking."" Earlier, we reported that McCawley's co-counsel David Boies said Giuffre was ""pleased"" the Duke of York's motion had been denied and she ""looks forward"" to bringing her case in court. Neither the prince nor his lawyers have made a statement in response to today's decision. The duke has vigorously denied Giuffre's allegations against him. More now on the details of today's legal ruling by a New York judge. Judge Kaplan, as part of his ruling, addressed an argument by Prince
Andrewâs legal team that a New York state law giving victims of child sexual abuse more time to sue is âunconstitutional"". The state's Child Victimâs Act allows such victims to sue until they turn 55 years
old, giving those who suffered decades-old abuse a chance to seek justice. Prince
Andrew's lawyers said that while the law allowed survivors to sue for abuses
they suffered before they were 18 years old, the age of consent in New York is
17. That's the age Ms Giuffre was when she says she was abused by the royal (allegations he denies). Judge
Kaplan said Prince Andrew is not the first person to try and use this argument in
court, but it has been ârejected by every New York state and federal court to
have encountered it.â He adds: âIt
has been rejected repeatedly for good reason.â Read more about the Child Victimâs Act. Melissa Murray, a professor of law at New York University, says that allowing the allegations against Prince Andrew to advance to a civil trial in a New York court could be ""embarrassing to the monarchy"". But Prof Murray also warned that pursuing a settlement with Virginia Giuffre outside of court would be widely viewed as an implicit admission of wrongdoing on the Duke's part - which he has always strenuously denied. This video can not be played Prof Melissa Murray says a trial would be ""embarrassing to the monarchy"" Prince Andrew's lawyers had argued that Virginia Giuffre was prevented from pursuing her civil case against him due to a legal settlement she'd reached with Jeffrey Epstein in 2009. A clause in that agreement blocked future cases against Epstein and anyone else who could be a ""potential defendant"". But in his verdict, Judge Lewis A Kaplan said that the agreement, ""whatever it was intended to mean, is riddled with drafting problems and ambiguitiesâ. He added that the clause is far too broad and that it is unclear who exactly it is intended to cover. Judge Kaplan also said that an agreement must leave no reasonable doubt about the intent of the contracting parties and said that where such ambiguity exists it ""must be resolved byâ¦ a trial jury"". He told the duke's lawyers that the court cannot ""resolve any such
ambiguity on a motion to dismiss the complaint."" Prince Andrew has consistently denied Ms Giuffre's claims. A 2001 photo of Prince Andrew with Virginia Giuffre and Ghislaine Maxwell Prince Andrew has said he has ""no recollection"" of ever meeting Virginia Giuffre. Giuffre claims she was forced to have sex with the Duke of York on three occasions - in London, New York and on a private Caribbean island owned by late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein - between 2001 and 2002, beginning when she was 17. An infamous photo of the two together, with the prince's arm around Giuffre's waist, is what she says proves that first meeting in March 2001. Also in the frame is a smiling Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's former girlfriend and business associate, now convicted of trafficking girls for him to abuse. The photo is said to have been taken by Epstein himself inside the Belgravia townhouse belonging to Maxwell. Of the photo, the prince has suggested it may well have been doctored, adding that ""hug[s] and public displays of affection are not something that I do"". While Giuffre alleges they went to a nightclub and had sex at Maxwell's home later that evening, Prince Andrew insists he was actually with his daughter at a Pizza Express restaurant in the town of Woking, near London, on that day. BBC royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell says today's ruling in New York is ""a monumental mess"" for the Royal Family. ""We are not three days now since Buckingham Palace confirmed all the details of the [Queen's] Platinum Jubilee and we have the prospect of this civil sex case against her second son in September,"" he says. Our correspondent says further public airing of the claims against the Duke of York - which he denies - make it ""very, very hard"" for him to have any sort of public role within the family. ""He clings on to his colonelship of the Grenadier Guards,"" says Witchell. ""I'll tell you this: the Grenadier Guards don't want him."" The Guards have not spoken publicly about the case, he notes, but ""behind the scenes, they are acutely embarrassed to have Prince Andrew as their colonel"". This video can not be played Prince Andrew case 'a monumental mess' This video can not be played Virginia Giuffre on Prince Andrew: 'I knew I had to keep him happy' Back in 2019, Virginia Giuffre told BBC Panorama that she had been brought to Britain aged 17 to have sex with Prince Andrew and implored the British public to ""stand beside her"". She said she had accompanied the paedophile Jeffrey Epstein and his then girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell, to London in March 2001, where they met the Duke of York. ""Weâre having tea and Andrewâs talking about Fergie, which is his
ex-wife. And Ghislaineâs bad mouthing Fergieâ¦ It seemed like friends just
catching up,"" she said. Roberts alleged that they later accompanied the Duke to Tramp nightclub. âHe asked me to dance,"" Roberts recalled during the interview. ""He is the most hideous dancer Iâve ever
seenâ¦ and this guy was sweating all over meâ¦ But I knew I had to keep him happy
because thatâs what Jeffrey and Ghislaine would expect from me. ""In the car, Ghislaine tells me that I had to do for Andrew what I
do for Jeffrey. And that made me sick. I just didnât expect it from royalty,"" she said. She alleged that later that evening, she had sex with Prince Andrew upstairs at Maxwell's house in Belgravia, London. ""It was a wicked time in my life. It was a really scary time in my

Sort it out or step aside - donor to PM,"John Caudwell donated Â£500,000 to the Conservatives before the last election A major Conservative donor has issued an ultimatum to Boris Johnson over revelations about lockdown parties in Downing Street. John Caudwell said: ""Sort it out, Boris, or step aside and let someone else sort it out so that the Tories aren't wiped out at the next election."" The Phones4U founder donated Â£500,000 to the Conservatives ahead of the 2019 general election. He criticised the government's perceived ""arrogance and hypocrisy"". PM can't hide from party allegations, says Labour No 10 staff had to block Downing Street parties What rules would the Downing Street party have broken? Billionaire Caudwell goes head-to-head with Labour's John McDonnell Mr Caudwell was one of the Conservative Party's biggest individual donors at the last general election, and has previously given money to pro-Brexit Tory MP Sir Bill Cash. He told BBC News: ""Although I have always obeyed the rules I have never been puritanical about lockdown restrictions so I find it difficult to personally get excited about an outdoor drinks party. But it's the perceived arrogance, hypocrisy and rule breaking that is impossible to justify. ""While the rest of us were striving to follow the ever-changing rules - including myself, even when I deemed them to be excessive at best, nonsensical at worst - those who were setting those rules were, apparently freely and frequently, disregarding them. ""Each one of these new revelations gives greater force to the accusation that areas of the government think it's 'one rule for them, one rule for the rest of us'. ""This is disastrous."" He added that he was not a ""dyed-in-the-wool Tory"" and had been critical of the government's economic recovery plans, urging more investment in apprenticeships and renewable energy. But he added: ""I do think the Conservatives are the best party to govern this country, particularly as we look to navigate opportunities post-Brexit. ""Sort it out, Boris, or step aside and let someone else sort it out so that the Tories aren't wiped out at the next election."" Alasdair Locke, who has donated Â£280,000 to the Conservative Party since Mr Johnson came to power, said the lockdown parties were ""something the media is making a great deal of"" and voters would be concerned with ""serious stuff"" at the next election. ""I really don't think a leadership change, or challenge, is needed at this stage. A bit more grip would help but that will probably come."" The prime minister is under growing pressure from Labour - and anger from some Conservatives - over his alleged attendance at a previously unreported Downing Street party. It comes after ITV published a leaked email from the PM's principal private secretary, Martin Reynolds, inviting 100 staff to ""socially distanced drinks in the No 10 garden"" on 20 May 2020. The invitation for the event, which was organised when strict lockdown rules were still in place, encouraged people to ""bring your own booze"" and ""make the most of the lovely weather"". Witnesses told the BBC the PM and his wife had been among about 30 people who attended the gathering. But Mr Johnson has declined to say whether he was one of them. The PM's official spokesman also refused to comment on the claims while the investigation was taking place, but he added that the prime minister retained full confidence in Mr Reynolds. Senior civil servant Sue Gray is investigating lockdown parties in Downing Street, including the event on 20 May 2020, and is expected to report shortly.

Call to boost 'paltry' cash to tackle second homes,"This video can not be played ""The young should not be priced out of the area they grew up"" The Welsh government has been accused of offering a ""paltry solution"" to the second homes crisis in Wales. Ministers have promised Â£11m to buy and refurbish homes in the most affected parts of Wales. But Dyfodol i'r Iaith, a Welsh language campaign group, says the government's offer ""roughly equates to buying or building 44 homes."" Welsh government said ""no one silver bullet"" can tackle the matter and it is introducing a ""suite"" of measures. What's Wales' problem with second homes? Pilot planned to tackle second homes 'crisis' Too many second homes in parts of Wales, says FM Dyfodol i'r Iaith said Â£200m should be earmarked for building or buying 800 homes to respond to the housing needs on the west coast of Wales. It has also emerged that the Welsh government is yet to recruit two officials to support a pilot, launched this month, to look at the issue in the Dwyfor area of Gwynedd, which stretches from the Llyn Peninsula to the area west of Porthmadog. The Welsh government plans to make Â£11m available to buy and refurbish empty homes within Gwynedd, Anglesey, Ceredigion, Carmarthenshire and Pembrokeshire Rhys Tudur, leader of Nefyn Town Council and a member of the local housing campaign group Hawl i Fyw Adra, said the pilot was ""painfully slow"" and that it was ""still very uncertain what's included in the pilot itself. And while things are moving slowly, more homes are leaving local hands"". He also called on the Welsh government to provide more money to tackle the housing crisis, criticising the Â£1m promised for buying and renovating houses specifically within the pilot area, by the Welsh minister Julie James in November. ""Significant sums of money are required. A million pounds for the pilot area won't make any sort of difference,"" Mr Tudur said. ""It is paltry at the moment how much the Welsh government is willing to earmark for this."" Charles and Liz Evans said they empathised with those struggling to get on the housing ladder Charles and Liz Evans, who are from Bristol and have a holiday home in Aberdaron, said they empathised with those who were struggling to get on the housing ladder. Liz Evans' mother bought the home in Aberdaron in the 1940s, where she grew up. Mr Evans said: ""We see why locals are angry that prices are sky high and locals can't get anywhere near it. ""On the other hand I don't think holiday homes should be banned, we need some type of compromise."" Mark Jones said he worries about whether his daughter be able to get on the ladder Mark Jones, from Pwllheli, said it was a ""massive problem"". His 23-year-old daughter still lives at home and he said he worries about whether she'll be able to get on the ladder. ""I think there needs to be a better infrastructure in terms of getting affordable homes - whether that is through the local authority - but I do think we need help from Cardiff, the Senedd."" Most of the second homes registered for council tax in Wales are in the north west county of Gwynedd - 5,098 -  followed by 4,068 in Pembrokeshire and 2,139 in Anglesey. The Welsh government plans to make Â£11m available to buy and refurbish empty homes within the Dwyfor pilot area and more broadly in Gwynedd, Anglesey, Ceredigion, Carmarthenshire and Pembrokeshire. But Dyfodol i'r Iaith called for more substantial and urgent action. The group is calling on the Welsh government to earmark Â£200m to be mainly spent ""within the west where the housing crisis is at its worst"", which could ""allow for 800 homes to be bought or built"". It said those houses could ""respond to local needs"" with the option of part-ownership and as holiday-let properties in public ownership - the profits of which could go to subsidise local housing or developing infrastructure of benefit to those communities. The group is calling on the Welsh government to ""urgently commission a study regarding the potential and practical obligations of the scheme"" to be published by Easter. The second homes issue has sparked protests in Wales A Welsh government spokesperson said ministers had committed to delivering 20,000 ""low carbon, good quality social homes for rent across Wales over the next five years"". ""In addition to this, we have committed an extra Â£5m, taking the total to Â£11m this financial year alone, to the local authorities whose communities are impacted by second home ownership and holiday lets so they can buy and renovate empty homes."" It added: ""This is a complex issue that no one silver bullet can solve, which is why we are introducing a suite of measurements to see which interventions will be most effective in maintaining the vibrancy of Wales' communities."" In November, thecooperation agreementbetween Labour and Plaid Cymru promised ""immediate and radical action to address the proliferation of second homes"". The Welsh government's second homes plan,announced a day later, promised a two-phase approach to tackling problems caused by the issue in Wales. The first phase included launching a pilot area and appointing two officials to support and develop plans in the area. The second phase would involve a longer-term consultation on powers to limit the creation of second homes and holiday lets, and more local tax varying powers. The first phase pilot, starting in January, covers Dwyfor. At the time, the Welsh government said the pilot would ""build on the practical support Welsh government is already providing to address affordability and availability of housing and will be tailored to suit the needs of people in the area"". It added that ""two dedicated posts will support delivery of the pilot in the areas to link the interventions, engage with communities and maximise the impact"". Asked by BBC Wales why those posts had not yet been advertised, the Welsh government said it was working with ""partners"" towards ""the recruitment of two priority posts and putting in place the necessary evaluation of the pilot"".

"Armed stand-off forcing businesses to close doorsA school is closed, a library is used by police and businesses are shut as a stand-off continues.","Earlsdon Primary School has been closed since Monday because of the stand-off A school remains closed, a library is given over to police use and businesses are shut as an armed stand-off continues into a fourth day. A 41-year-old man barricaded himself in a flat in Coventry with his eight-year-old son on Sunday. It is believed there are weapons in the property on Earlsdon Avenue North amid what police describe as a really sensitive policing operation. Safety is the main concern, West Midlands Police said. Residents said they had been getting calls from friends and family concerned for their welfare. Stuart Taylor, who has a butcher's business on nearby Newcombe Road, said he had been forced to close his doors and was trying to get deliveries to his regular customers, with the assistance of the police. He said, it is not the end of the world but he is worried about the impact on the community if the stand-off continues. ""It can't carry on like this,"" he said. ""Some people can't even get to their own houses and have been told to contact homeless shelter if they can't find somewhere to stay."" He also said he was concerned about the cost of the ongoing police operation. One couple, who have lived in the area for more than 30 years, said normally things were quiet. A woman, who did not give her name, said: ""In the daytime it's like a village really, everybody knows each other. ""I'm in a book group in the library and we were due to meet tomorrow evening, but clearly the library is being used as a sort of rest station for the police."" Armed officers have been outside the property since Sunday Supt Ronan Tyrer said the safety of all involved was of ""prime importance"" West Midlands Police said armed response officers remained outside the property and specialist negotiators were continuing to speak to the man in an effort to bring the situation to a safe conclusion. Supt Ronan Tyrer said on Wednesday: ""I appreciate for residents, but for also the wider community, including those parents of children at Earlsdon Primary School, that it is incredibly frustrating. ""What I will say is that this is a really sensitive policing operation."" And he added: ""We have to have the cordons in place and we are working incredibly hard to bring to a conclusion swiftly, but of prime importance safely, this incident."" He also said that while it was a ""significant policing response"" the operation had not affected ""overall resourcing levels."" Are you in the area?  Is there any information you'd like to share?

"Government's PPE VIP lane unlawful, court rules","The government's use of a ""VIP lane"" to award contracts for personal protective equipment (PPE) to two companies was unlawful, the High Court has ruled. Campaigners claimed the VIP lane was reserved for referrals from MPs, ministers and senior officials and gave some companies an unfair advantage. A judge ruled it was unlawful to give the two companies preferential treatment as part of the VIP lane. But she said both offers were likely to have been given contracts anyway. The legal action was brought by the Good Law Project and EveryDoctor which claimed the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) unlawfully awarded contracts to supply PPE - such as medical quality facemasks and gowns - during the height of the first wave of the coronavirus pandemic. Why were the government's Covid contracts challenged? 50 firms got VIP fast-track Covid contracts WATCH ON IPLAYER: Panorama - Cashing in on Covid The groups took legal action over more than Â£340m in contracts awarded to PestFix, a firm that supplies pest control products, and a contract worth about Â£252m to the hedge fund Ayanda Capital. The campaigners said the DHSC ""prioritised suppliers including PestFix and Ayanda because of who they knew, not what they could deliver"". But the DHSC told the court it ""wholeheartedly"" rejected the case against it and said the VIP lane was rational and resulted in a ""large number of credible offers"" in an environment where PPE deals often failed within ""minutes"". Mrs Justice O'Farrell ruled that while the use of the VIP lane - officially known as the high priority lane - was unlawful, she found that both of the companies' offers ""justified priority treatment"" on their merits and were ""very likely"" to have been awarded contracts even without it. The judge said the DHSC's evidence ""establishes that presence on the high priority lane did not confer any advantage at the decision-making stage of the process"", but she said it was clear that ""offers that were introduced through the senior referrers received earlier consideration at the outset of the process"". She said the high priority lane team was better resourced and able to respond more quickly to offers but she also found ""sufficient financial due diligence"" was carried out in respect of both sets of contracts. A DHSC spokesperson said at the height of the pandemic there had been a ""desperate need for PPE to protect health and social care staff"" and said the government ""rightly took swift and decisive action to secure it"". ""The ruling says it is highly likely these offers would have been awarded if they were processed through other channels also used to process offers. All contracts underwent sufficient financial and technical due diligence and the court found that we did not rely on the referral to the high priority lane when awarding contracts,"" they said. A spokesman for Matt Hancock, who was health secretary at the time the contracts were awarded, said he was delighted that the court found that the priority treatment was ""justified"". He said: ""As the National Audit Office has confirmed, ministers had no involvement in procurement decisions or contract management. ""The department was doing the best it possibly could within the rules to respond to an unprecedented situation, and crucially, the court has rightly found that action was justified and absolutely no rectification or further action is necessary."" A court previously ruled that Mr Hancock hadacted unlawfully when his department did not reveal details of contractsit had signed during the Covid pandemic. A PestFix spokesman said the company was pleased to have been ""completely vindicated"" by the High Court over how the contract was awarded, saying the decision was ""based purely on our ability to deliver"". He added the company had only been made aware that it had been placed in the high priority lane by a National Audit Office report in November 2020. A spokesman for Ayanda Capital said: ""We are pleased that, despite all the claims to the contrary, the court has rejected any suggestion that we were not an appropriate business to source desperately-needed personal protective equipment and concluded that the offer we made the Department of Health justified priority treatment on its merits."" The company was ""doing the best we possibly could to help to respond to an unprecedented national emergency"", he said, adding that the court had not criticised the way it had conducted itself in anyway. Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner called for an independent investigation to ""get to the bottom of how Â£3.5bn of taxpayers' cash were handed out in crony contracts and ensure it can never happen again"". Liberal Democrat health spokesperson Daisy Cooper described the ruling as a ""damning judgement"" and said: ""Not only did the Conservatives give their mates privileged access to lucrative Covid contracts, they did it unlawfully."" The high priority lane, or VIP lane, was introduced on 2 April 2020 in order to help the government choose between the offers it was getting in huge numbers. The idea was to treat offers of PPE with greater urgency if they came from a supplier recommended by ministers, government officials or MPs and members of the House of Lords, from any party. ANational Audit Office report,externalfound that up to the end of July 2020, about one in 10 suppliers who had been put in the high priority lane was then awarded contracts, while the figure was less than one in 100 for other suppliers. Between the start of the pandemic and 30 May 2021, the DHSC distributed more than 11.7 billion items of PPE. But there have been issues with some items of equipment bought by the government, including masks and gowns that havehad to be withdrawn from use in the NHS. 50 firms got VIP fast-track Covid contracts Government acted unlawfully over Covid contract Hancock acted unlawfully over Covid contracts Why have Covid contracts been challenged?

Champagne sales give Sainsbury's bumper Christmas,"Strong sales of premium food and champagne over Christmas have put Sainsbury's on track to boost profits. Britain's second biggest supermarket has raised its full-year profit guidance to ""at least"" Â£720m before tax, up from Â£660m. Customers spent more on treats, as well as record amounts on champagne and sparkling wine for festivities. Grocery sales over Christmas rose by 0.1% in the six weeks to 8 January, compared to the year before. Sales of food and drink saw a boost of 6.8% in comparison with pre-pandemic levels. The retailer's chief executive said it was down to more people eating at home, although formal rules restricting gatherings weren't in place this last Christmas. Simon Roberts said: ""I am really pleased with how we delivered for customers this Christmas."" He added that shoppers had splurged more on party food and desserts from its premium Taste the Difference range over the holidays. While Christmas trading saw some bright spots in food, Mr Roberts said in a call with journalists that supply chain problems had affected the availability of toys and electrical good at Argos in particular, with ""significant challenges"" expected in 2022 as well. Shoppers return to supermarkets for festive feasts Sainsbury's raises pay to Â£10 an hour Next and Greggs raise prices as costs spiral In the grocery aisles,consumers opted for more meat-free products, with Plant Pioneers' No Gammon Joint and No Salmon Encroute proving popular Christmas centrepieces. ""The backdrop was challenging and our teams worked hard throughout the year to make sure we had all of the products everyone wanted,"" Mr Roberts said. The supermarket said on Wednesday that spiralling cost inflation had been offset by savings as well as the better-than-expected grocery sales. Overall though, Sainsbury's said that like-for-like sales, excluding fuel and the effect of new shops opening, fell by 4.5% in the three months to 8 January. General merchandise, which includes homeware, toys and other goods from Argos, fell by 16% year-on-year. The group said that it was down to comparisons with a ""strong performance"" during lockdown the previous Christmas, as well as a decision to offer fewer discounts. Toys and tech gadgets in particular suffered with declines seen in the double digits. The retailer said in a statement on Wednesday that global supply chain issues had affected the availability of in-demand products. But the group said cost reductions at Argos, driven by the group's decision to shut 420 of the brand's branches, helped strengthen its profits. Ross Hindle, analyst at Third Bridge, said: ""December's trading was particularly strong for UK supermarkets, with home working translating into home eating and fewer consumers dining out as Omicron swept the country. ""Sainsbury's should be able to hold on to its gains thanks to its loyal customer base and innovation around product lines"", he said, noting that the retailer had added more than 600 new products during the last few months. But he said that rapid delivery firms and discount supermarkets like Aldi or Lidl could still pose a threat. Over the festive period, Sainsbury's fulfilled more than 700,000 online orders per week, with orders on its website and app jumping 41% in the week to Christmas. It also introduced a ""price match"" campaign, which included matching around 150 prices with Aldi in a bid to keep prices lower for customers. The firm recently said that it would become the latest UK supermarket to pay shop workers at least Â£10 an hour. It will increase its basic rate from Â£9.50 to Â£10 an hour for staff across its supermarkets and Argos stores from 6 March, following similar moves by Lidl and Aldi last year. Sainsbury's shares were up 1.75% in early trading in London on Wednesday following its trading update. Tesco and Marks & Spencer are due to release Christmas trading updates on Thursday. Other companies updating on their Christmas performance on Wednesday included JD Sports, Dunelm and Whitbread: Sports retailer JD Sports raised its annual profit forecasts on the back of ""positive"" performances across Christmas and Black Friday. Total sales for the 22 weeks to 1 January were more than 10% ahead of the same period in 2020. The homeware chain Dunelm said it saw a ""record performance"" in the 13 weeks to Christmas, with sales up 13% to Â£407m versus the year before. Premier Inn owner Whitbread said stays at its UK hotels had remained strong in recent weeks, despite the spread of Omicron. But its food and drink sales dipped.

Tory MPs demand answers from PM over party claimPM will face MPs amid mounting pressure to say if he attended a Downing Street event held in lockdown.UK Politics,"The PM is set to face questions he has so far declined to answer Conservative and opposition MPs are demanding answers from Boris Johnson over whether he attended a drinks event in the No 10 garden during lockdown. Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner said that if he was there, and he lied about it, his position is ""untenable"". And Tory MPs have been expressing their anger and concern over the reports. Mr Johnson will take Prime Minister's Questions at noon - his first public appearance since details of the May 2020 event emerged. The prime minister has so far declined to say whether he attended the gathering, but witnesses have told the BBC both he and his wife were among 30 people at the drinks. Sort it out or step aside, Tory donor tells PM The list of alleged government lockdown gatherings Tory MPs send angry message to Boris Johnson The PM's performance in the Commons will be closely watched by Conservative MPs, some of whom are understood to have privately called for a leadership challenge to Mr Johnson. A contest will take place if 54 Conservative MPs send letters to the backbench 1922 committee. Senior Tory backbencher Tobias Ellwood said the prime minister needed to apologise for his actions, ""show some contrition"" and get a grip of the situation or he will be ""out of office"". Conservative MP David Simmonds told BBC London: ""We're all pretty frustrated with the situation. The PM is going to have to start answering some questions about it today."" He said holding a party in lockdown was ""clearly indefensible"" and it should not be impossible for Mr Johnson to say whether he was there or not. Backbencher Nigel Mills told BBC Newsnight: ""If the prime minister knowingly attended a party, I can't see how he can survive."" On Tuesday, Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said Mr Johnson must quit if he was found to have broken Covid rules. What rules would the Downing Street party have broken? Analysis: Tory mood turns sour On Monday,ITV published a leaked email,externalfrom Mr Johnson's principal private secretary, Martin Reynolds, inviting staff to ""socially distanced drinks in the No 10 garden"" on 20 May 2020 - when lockdown rules in England banned large outdoor gatherings. The invitation encouraged people to ""bring your own booze"" and ""make the most of the lovely weather"". Mr Johnson has said it is a matter for Sue Gray - the senior civil servant investigating a series of reported parties in Downing Street and in Whitehall in 2020 - to determine what happened. The PM's official spokesman has also refused to confirm whether Mr Johnson attended the May 2020 Downing Street gathering. He added that the prime minister retained full confidence in Mr Reynolds. This video can not be played Watch: ""Boris Johnson must now resign,"" says Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey Conservative MP Huw Merriman insisted ""more clarity"" was needed from the prime minister on what took place and whether he attended, adding that people were ""in the dark"" about what went on. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he didn't believe Mr Johnson should resign, hailing government achievements including the successful vaccination rollout and the prime minister ""holding his nerve"" on refusing to introduce further Covid rules in England. This video can not be played Watch: The BBC speaks to families of people who died the same month of the No 10 party Another Conservative, Christian Wakeford, tweeted: ""How do you defend the indefensible? You can't! It's embarrassing and what's worse is it further erodes trust in politics when it's already low."" And in an email to her constituent, Caroline Nokes said: ""I have no words that can adequately express how angry I am at the 'don't do as I do, do as I say' attitude that appears to have prevailed in Downing Street."" Questions are being raised about the role of the civil service too, with former senior civil servant Sir David Normington telling Radio 4's Today programme calling a party in the middle of lockdown was ""inexplicable"". ""It's a terrible misjudgement, brings disrepute on the civil service. This isn't just about the responsibilities of PMs and politicians, it's also about the behaviour and responsibilities of senior civil servants. That's a very serious matter."" Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner told BBC Breakfast if Mr Johnson had broken Covid rules and lied to the public and parliament, then his position as prime minister was now ""untenable"". ""The prime minister cannot break the law, lie to the British public and not be held to account for that,"" she added. This video can not be played A DUP MP cries while questioning the government over claims it broke lockdown rules Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey told BBC Breakfast if the prime minister had a ""shred of decency left"", he should resign today. He added Mr Johnson was ""incapable of leading our country through this public health crisis"", accusing him of being a ""threat to the health of the nation"" as the public would not listen to anything he had to say. If the prime minister won't resign, it was the duty of Conservative MPs to ""do the right thing"" and ensure he does ""in the interests of the country"", Sir Ed argued. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer will return to Prime Minister's Questions later, having missed last week's session after contracting Covid. The BBC has been told that Mr Johnson will not make a separate statement on parties in the House of Commons but a senior government source didn't rule out him making some remarks at the start of Prime Minister's Questions. The goodwill-to-all-men moment the Christmas holidays promised is very much over. The subject of conversation among Tories on Tuesday was not the government's planned menu of policy fare for the week, but whether or not the moment had arrived when Boris Johnson, election-winner, had become Boris Johnson, discredited liability. Whether or not, in the words of that senior MP, the party should ""get rid of him"". The party has not reached that conclusion. The government has an enormous majority. Administrations go through rocky times. But the latest, and continuing, stream of revelations, has made the question of the prime minister's survival the central one again. Read more from Laura here. On Tuesday, Mr Johnson sent Paymaster General Michael Ellis to respond on his behalf to an emergency Commons question on the issue tabled by Labour. The Conservative benches were sparsely populated, while no senior ministers appeared publicly to defend Mr Johnson. During the session, DUP MP Jim Shannon was brought to tears when speaking of the death of his mother-in-law during the pandemic. In December, the prime minister asked for an independent inquiry to investigate a series of allegations about events taking place in government buildings in 2020 despite coronavirus restrictions being in force. Ms Gray's probe is investigating specific eventsincluding a leaving drinks for a No 10 aide on 27 November, a Department of Education gathering on 10 December and a Christmas quiz for No 10 staff on 15 December. It is also examining the Downing Street Christmas party on 18 December, and on Tuesday, Mr Ellis said drinks events held in the Downing Street garden on 20 and 15 May 2020 would also be added to the inquiry.

"Champagne sales give Sainsbury's bumper ChristmasStronger sales of premium food and champagne will boost profits, Britain's second biggest supermarket says.Business","Strong sales of premium food and champagne over Christmas have put Sainsbury's on track to boost profits. Britain's second biggest supermarket has raised its full-year profit guidance to ""at least"" Â£720m before tax, up from Â£660m. Customers spent more on treats, as well as record amounts on champagne and sparkling wine for festivities. Grocery sales over Christmas rose by 0.1% in the six weeks to 8 January, compared to the year before. Sales of food and drink saw a boost of 6.8% in comparison with pre-pandemic levels. The retailer's chief executive said it was down to more people eating at home, although formal rules restricting gatherings weren't in place this last Christmas. Simon Roberts said: ""I am really pleased with how we delivered for customers this Christmas."" He added that shoppers had splurged more on party food and desserts from its premium Taste the Difference range over the holidays. While Christmas trading saw some bright spots in food, Mr Roberts said in a call with journalists that supply chain problems had affected the availability of toys and electrical good at Argos in particular, with ""significant challenges"" expected in 2022 as well. Shoppers return to supermarkets for festive feasts Sainsbury's raises pay to Â£10 an hour Next and Greggs raise prices as costs spiral In the grocery aisles,consumers opted for more meat-free products, with Plant Pioneers' No Gammon Joint and No Salmon Encroute proving popular Christmas centrepieces. ""The backdrop was challenging and our teams worked hard throughout the year to make sure we had all of the products everyone wanted,"" Mr Roberts said. The supermarket said on Wednesday that spiralling cost inflation had been offset by savings as well as the better-than-expected grocery sales. Overall though, Sainsbury's said that like-for-like sales, excluding fuel and the effect of new shops opening, fell by 4.5% in the three months to 8 January. General merchandise, which includes homeware, toys and other goods from Argos, fell by 16% year-on-year. The group said that it was down to comparisons with a ""strong performance"" during lockdown the previous Christmas, as well as a decision to offer fewer discounts. Toys and tech gadgets in particular suffered with declines seen in the double digits. The retailer said in a statement on Wednesday that global supply chain issues had affected the availability of in-demand products. But the group said cost reductions at Argos, driven by the group's decision to shut 420 of the brand's branches, helped strengthen its profits. Ross Hindle, analyst at Third Bridge, said: ""December's trading was particularly strong for UK supermarkets, with home working translating into home eating and fewer consumers dining out as Omicron swept the country. ""Sainsbury's should be able to hold on to its gains thanks to its loyal customer base and innovation around product lines"", he said, noting that the retailer had added more than 600 new products during the last few months. But he said that rapid delivery firms and discount supermarkets like Aldi or Lidl could still pose a threat. Over the festive period, Sainsbury's fulfilled more than 700,000 online orders per week, with orders on its website and app jumping 41% in the week to Christmas. It also introduced a ""price match"" campaign, which included matching around 150 prices with Aldi in a bid to keep prices lower for customers. The firm recently said that it would become the latest UK supermarket to pay shop workers at least Â£10 an hour. It will increase its basic rate from Â£9.50 to Â£10 an hour for staff across its supermarkets and Argos stores from 6 March, following similar moves by Lidl and Aldi last year. Sainsbury's shares were up 1.75% in early trading in London on Wednesday following its trading update. Tesco and Marks & Spencer are due to release Christmas trading updates on Thursday. Other companies updating on their Christmas performance on Wednesday included JD Sports, Dunelm and Whitbread: Sports retailer JD Sports raised its annual profit forecasts on the back of ""positive"" performances across Christmas and Black Friday. Total sales for the 22 weeks to 1 January were more than 10% ahead of the same period in 2020. The homeware chain Dunelm said it saw a ""record performance"" in the 13 weeks to Christmas, with sales up 13% to Â£407m versus the year before. Premier Inn owner Whitbread said stays at its UK hotels had remained strong in recent weeks, despite the spread of Omicron. But its food and drink sales dipped.

British Gas owner warns high bills for two years,"This video can not be played Chris O'Shea is chief executive of British Gas owner Centrica Soaring energy prices which threaten the living standards of millions could last up to two years, the boss of the UK's biggest energy supplier has said. Chris O'Shea, chief executive of British Gas owner Centrica, said there was ""no reason"" to expect gas prices would come down ""any time soon"". He said hopes that bills rising by more than 50% to about Â£2,000 a year would be short-lived may be misplaced. Rising energy bills have raised concerns over the cost of living. ""The market suggests the high gas prices will be here for the next 18 months to two years,"" Mr O'Shea told the BBC. 'My energy bill has already risen by Â£60 a month' Why are gas prices so high? Energy firm sorry over pet-cuddling warmth advice Many countries see gas as an intermediate solution while they wean themselves off more carbon-intensive energy sources, such as oil and coal, creating an international dash for gas as the world economy wakes up after its Covid-related slumber. ""As we move towards net zero, gas is a big transition fuel,"" Mr O'Shea said. ""And so as you turn off coal-fired power stations in other countries, there isn't an abundance of gas that you can just turn on quickly."" The idea of re-badging gas as a ""transitional fuel"", rather than as a traditional hydrocarbon, has growing political support and has encouraged those calling for increased investment in boosting the supply of gas from domestic sources such as the North Sea. Are you worried about the rising cost of energy bills? How will it affect you? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external WhatsApp:+44 7756 165803,external OrUpload your pictures/video here Tweet:@BBC_HaveYourSay,external Please read ourterms & conditionsandprivacy policy However, Mr O'Shea was doubtful that higher levels of UK-sourced gas would have made much difference to surging prices. ""I'm not sure an increase in UK supply would have brought the price down from Â£3 a therm, as it was in December, from 50p as it was a year ago,"" he said. ""We bring gas in from the United States, from Norway, from Europe, from Qatar, from other places. So we're not in a position to simply have the UK as an isolated energy market. We are part of a global market."" Mr O'Shea suggested three moves the government could make to help households cope with what has been described as a ""cost of living crisis"". Defer the cost incurred by surviving suppliers from taking on customers of the many companies that have gone bust, rather than it be added to upcoming bills. Take the 5% VAT off energy temporarily or permanently. Move levies charged to fund a green transition from bills to general taxation. ""Those three things together, could be enacted very quickly, without regret,"" he said. ""And that would take care of half of the price rise. And then you could get a further relief targeted to those households that needed most."" Government officials have discussed targeting relief through changes to the warm homes discount plan, which currently offers a one-off payment of Â£140 to those in receipt of certain benefits. Sir Ed Davey, leader of the Liberal Democrats, has proposed increasing that payment to Â£300 and widening the number of people eligible. Mr O'Shea said the current design of the scheme would see relief for some result in rises in everyone else's bills. ""The way the warm homes discount works is that the cost of that scheme is met by customers. So if you increase it, you increase energy bills and we think that whatever relief comes is got to not be at the expense of hard-pressed energy consumers,"" he added. Another option proposed by some in the energy industry is to find a way to provide support to energy companies via loans or a fund, which firms could borrow from when wholesale prices are high and pay back once they've fallen. But according to Mr O'Shea, that plan would rely on the assumption that prices would fall which he said might be wishful thinking. ""Ultimately, everybody in the UK is a taxpayer and an energy consumer. So the cost of this is going to have to be paid by UK citizens,"" he added. ""The question as to whether that's paid for the energy bill, or for general taxation is one for government."" The government has indicated it will decide on what support it will offer before the new energy price cap, which is the maximum rate suppliers can charge for a default tariff, is set on 7 February.

"Nightclubs still waiting on Covid funding supportGrants for clubs - closed under Covid rules last year - have still not been paid, the industry says.Scotland","Nightclub owners have criticised the slow rollout of financial support for their businesses, which have been closed again under Covid restrictions. Clubs have been closed since 27 December withNicola Sturgeon announcing the shutdown will remain in place until at least 24 January. But trade groups said Scottish government funding promised before Christmas has not yet materialised. Deputy First Minister John Swinney said the grants will be paid ""very soon"". Restrictions on large outdoor events in Scotland, including football matches and concerts, are to be lifted from next Monday. But limits on indoor events and venues will remain in place for at least another week as part of a phased approach to lifting measures brought in to help deal with a surge in Covid cases caused by the Omicron variant. Scotland's nightclubs to close for three weeks from 27 December Nightclubs close and 1m distancing returns Restrictions on large outdoor events in Scotland lifted Gavin Stevenson, vice-chairman of the Night Time Industries Association Scotland (NTIAS) and director of the Mor-Rioghain Group of hospitality venues, toldBBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme: ""As of today not a single penny of the funds promised before Christmas have reached businesses. ""It is putting businesses in an incredibly difficult situation, wondering how on earth they are going to pay their staff this week when they've got no money in the bank because they have been forced to close or trade is unviable by the current round of restrictions."" Mr Stevenson claimed the forms for the Scottish government's nightclub closure fund had not been issued yet, adding this is putting business owners and their staff ""in an untenable position"". Confetti raining down on people queueing outside the Buff Club in Glasgow which is among the venues affected by lengthy periods of closure over the last two years required by Covid rules Deputy First Minister John Swinney told Good Morning Scotland that the funding issue ""has got the attention of ministers"". He added: ""We're moving as quickly as we possibly can do to make the financial support available to the sectors which have been affected by the restrictions. ""We work closely with local authorities to make sure such funding arrangements can be put in place. ""The timescale should be very soon, it's difficult to give a precise timescale but I would think within the next two weeks would be a reasonable expectation."" Mr Swinney said the delay was partly down to setting up the payment process and the public holidays over the Christmas period. The government's nightclub closure fund allows venues to apply for a grant up to Â£55,000. Other hospitality businesses have also spoken of the impact restrictions have had on trade. Restrictions were introduced for pubs, restaurants and other indoor public places on 27 December. Indoor hospitality and leisure venues have to ensure there is a one-metre distance between different groups of people, and table service is required where alcohol is served. Scott Mitchell, managing director of Surgeons Quarter, which runs a hotel and events business in Edinburgh, said it had lost Â£225,000 in sales due to cancellations of Christmas and Hogmanay events. He said: ""While we welcome the apparent mindset shift towards gearing up for living with the pandemic, the government simply isn't doing enough to save hospitality. ""The first minister is leaving the sector with support measures that are not fit for purpose and arbitrary restrictions that will result in countless lost jobs and livelihoods. ""The support we are receiving equates to roughly 3% of the sales we have lost, which are in excess of Â£225,000."" Dr Liz Cameron, chief executive of the Scottish Chambers of Commerce, added: ""Businesses urgently need the financial support promised to them to be delivered as quickly as possible and additional financial support is made available should restrictions remain in place any longer."" Scottish Conservative MSP Murdo Fraser said many hospitality businesses were struggling and needed urgent support. He continued: ""It's unacceptable that struggling businesses already on their knees as a result of Scottish government restrictions are still waiting to receive a penny in financial support - and are now being told it may be a further fortnight before they do so. ""Many of these businesses are in danger of going under, so every day counts."" Meanwhile, the Scottish government is also facing calls to end the outdoor restrictions earlier than Monday. Partick Thistle has said it faces ""significant financial impact"" as a result of crowd limits still being in place on Saturday. Indoor sports clubs have also questioned why they are still facing restrictions. RULES:What are the restrictions in Scotland?

Biden pushes overhaul of US election laws,"President Biden said the drive to pass his sweeping voting legislation was a ""battle for the soul of America"" US President Joe Biden has called for a historic change to Senate rules as he seeks to overhaul the country's election laws. In an impassioned speech, he said he supported changes that would allow his voting reforms to be passed without the support of opposition Republicans. Misgivings from two senators in his party are hampering his plans, and no Republicans have backed them. Currently, a majority of 60% is needed to pass most legislation in the Senate. And with the upper chamber of Congress split 50-50 between the two parties, Mr Biden's sweeping election bills are almost certain not to pass unless there is a change to that rule. Such a change is unlikely, analysts say, as it would require the support of every Democrat in the Senate as well as the tie-breaking vote of the vice-president. The bills - the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act - passed the lower chamber, the House of Representatives, last year. The former would introduce standardised, nationwide, voting rules as opposed to the current patchwork of state-by-state rules. The John Lewis Act, meanwhile, would require certain states to obtain government permission for any change to election regulations. ANALYSIS: Is this now Joe Biden's biggest headache? CONTEXT: What is the filibuster and why does it matter? ""To protect our democracy, I support changing the Senate rules, whichever way they need to be changed, to prevent a minority of senators from blocking action on voting rights,"" the president said in a speech in Georgia on Tuesday. ""I've been having these quiet conversations with members of Congress for the last two months. I'm tired of being quiet,"" he added, while banging his fist on the lectern. Mr Biden said the push to pass the legislation was a ""battle for the soul of America"", adding that the 60-vote rule - known as the filibuster - had rendered the Senate ""a shell of its former self"". For much of the Senate's history unlimited debate was allowed, enabling opponents to block legislation. Supporters say it is a check on government power and forces administrations to seek consensus. During World War One, rules were adopted to allow a two-thirds majority to bring debate to an end, but it was rarely used, and reduced to the 60-vote rule during the 1970s. Joe Biden is making a renewed push for voting legislation, but the prospects for success haven't changed much since congressional Democrats first advanced the current package of proposals back in January 2019. They're dim. The reasons should be familiar to this White House. Either Democrats need to attract Republican support in the Senate, or they must change the rules to allow the slim Democratic majority there to approve the legislation on its own. Neither seems likely, no matter how many speeches Mr Biden gives. Mr Biden's Georgia trip could simply be an attempt to satisfy restive members of his party's base, who believe the president is not doing enough to promote what they see as the most important issue facing the nation - and their party - today. But the outlook for success there doesn't look great, either. Some prominent voting rights activists are giving the Atlanta event a pass, viewing it as too little, too late. Even Stacey Abrams, the Georgia gubernatorial candidate and tireless advocate of Democratic reforms, was absent, citing ""scheduling conflicts"". Mr Biden may describe the coming voting rights showdown as a national ""turning point"", but the momentum is currently in a direction Democrats won't like. Forecasts for this year's mid-term elections have spurred a sense of urgency among Democrats. Political analysts say the party risks losing control of Congress, and voting reform advocates have expressed frustration that the White House has not acted sooner. Mr Biden said he was ""an institutionalist who was honoured to serve in the Senate"" for years, but he argued ""the threat to our democracy is so grave"" that he felt rule changes were necessary. But in 2019, Mr Biden warned that doing away with the filibuster would be ""very dangerous"", pointing out that his fellow Democrats have used the rule often to block Republican legislation. Back in 2005, Mr Biden said any attempt to eliminate the filibuster was ""an example of the arrogance of power"". Former President Donald Trump called for the filibuster to be scrapped when his fellow Republicans controlled the Senate, but then-Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell refused to go for ""the nuclear option"" as it is known on Capitol Hill. Republicans have argued that Mr Biden's voting legislation would impose questionable national standards on local elections. Speaking after the president's speech, Republican Senator Mike Capo said the two bills were a ""partisan, political power grab"" and voiced opposition to changing Senate rules. Jazmin Kay, 24, is a New York Democrat and the president of youth-voting advocacy group 18by.vote. She is glad to see the president talking about expanding voting access, but wants to see Congress pass legislation that would guarantee reform. ""We're frustrated with all the bureaucracy around voting rights,"" she says. ""If we don't have comprehensive voting rights reform, then we're not able to have a say in what is done in our government. Enthusiasm is waning [among younger Americans]."" Ryan Doucette, 18, is an Ohio Republican and chief of staff to the young conservatives at Gen Z GOP. He warns that one-size-fits-all electoral reform by the federal government is ""wildly misguided"" and ""rooted in cookie-cutter solutions"". ""Democrats incorrectly say Republicans are systematically trying to disenfranchise voters of colour, while some outspoken Republicans falsely claim that elections are rife with fraud,"" he says. ""Every community in America faces different voting rights challenges, and those should be addressed via sound policy for each distinct challenge."" Senate Democrats are planning to hold a debate in the next week on scrapping the filibuster. But two centrist Democrats - Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema - have indicated they will not go along. Other Senate Democrats, including Arizona's Mark Kelly, Montana's Jon Tester and Delaware's Chris Coons - have suggested they are on the fence. Republican-run states have introduced restrictions on access and verification since the 2020 election. They claim widespread voter fraud, though little concrete evidence has come to light.

MPs demand answers from PM over Covid drinks claimPM will face MPs amid mounting pressure to say if he attended a Downing Street party held in lockdown.,"The PM is set to face questions he has so far declined to answer Conservative and opposition MPs are demanding answers from Boris Johnson over whether he attended a drinks event in the No 10 garden during lockdown. Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner said that if he was there, and he lied about it, his position is ""untenable"". And Tory MPs have been expressing their anger and concern over the reports. Mr Johnson will take Prime Minister's Questions at noon - his first public appearance since details of the May 2020 event emerged.

Sainsbury's boosted by sales of Christmas treats,"Strong sales of premium food and champagne over Christmas have put Sainsbury's on track to boost profits. Britain's second biggest supermarket has raised its full-year profit guidance to ""at least"" Â£720m before tax, up from Â£660m. Customers spent more on treats, as well as record amounts on champagne and sparkling wine for festivities. Grocery sales over Christmas rose by 0.1% in the six weeks to 8 January, compared to the year before. Sales of food and drink saw a boost of 6.8% in comparison with pre-pandemic levels. The retailer's chief executive said it was down to more people eating at home, although formal rules restricting gatherings weren't in place this last Christmas. Simon Roberts said: ""I am really pleased with how we delivered for customers this Christmas."" He added that shoppers had splurged more on party food and desserts from its premium Taste the Difference range over the holidays. While Christmas trading saw some bright spots in food, Mr Roberts said in a call with journalists that supply chain problems had affected the availability of toys and electrical good at Argos in particular, with ""significant challenges"" expected in 2022 as well. Shoppers return to supermarkets for festive feasts Sainsbury's raises pay to Â£10 an hour Next and Greggs raise prices as costs spiral In the grocery aisles,consumers opted for more meat-free products, with Plant Pioneers' No Gammon Joint and No Salmon Encroute proving popular Christmas centrepieces. ""The backdrop was challenging and our teams worked hard throughout the year to make sure we had all of the products everyone wanted,"" Mr Roberts said. The supermarket said on Wednesday that spiralling cost inflation had been offset by savings as well as the better-than-expected grocery sales. Overall though, Sainsbury's said that like-for-like sales, excluding fuel and the effect of new shops opening, fell by 4.5% in the three months to 8 January. General merchandise, which includes homeware, toys and other goods from Argos, fell by 16% year-on-year. The group said that it was down to comparisons with a ""strong performance"" during lockdown the previous Christmas, as well as a decision to offer fewer discounts. Toys and tech gadgets in particular suffered with declines seen in the double digits. The retailer said in a statement on Wednesday that global supply chain issues had affected the availability of in-demand products. But the group said cost reductions at Argos, driven by the group's decision to shut 420 of the brand's branches, helped strengthen its profits. Ross Hindle, analyst at Third Bridge, said: ""December's trading was particularly strong for UK supermarkets, with home working translating into home eating and fewer consumers dining out as Omicron swept the country. ""Sainsbury's should be able to hold on to its gains thanks to its loyal customer base and innovation around product lines"", he said, noting that the retailer had added more than 600 new products during the last few months. But he said that rapid delivery firms and discount supermarkets like Aldi or Lidl could still pose a threat. Over the festive period, Sainsbury's fulfilled more than 700,000 online orders per week, with orders on its website and app jumping 41% in the week to Christmas. It also introduced a ""price match"" campaign, which included matching around 150 prices with Aldi in a bid to keep prices lower for customers. The firm recently said that it would become the latest UK supermarket to pay shop workers at least Â£10 an hour. It will increase its basic rate from Â£9.50 to Â£10 an hour for staff across its supermarkets and Argos stores from 6 March, following similar moves by Lidl and Aldi last year. Sainsbury's shares were up 1.75% in early trading in London on Wednesday following its trading update. Tesco and Marks & Spencer are due to release Christmas trading updates on Thursday. Other companies updating on their Christmas performance on Wednesday included JD Sports, Dunelm and Whitbread: Sports retailer JD Sports raised its annual profit forecasts on the back of ""positive"" performances across Christmas and Black Friday. Total sales for the 22 weeks to 1 January were more than 10% ahead of the same period in 2020. The homeware chain Dunelm said it saw a ""record performance"" in the 13 weeks to Christmas, with sales up 13% to Â£407m versus the year before. Premier Inn owner Whitbread said stays at its UK hotels had remained strong in recent weeks, despite the spread of Omicron. But its food and drink sales dipped.

The supermarket said on Wednesday that spiralling cost inflation had been offset by savings as well as the better-than-expected grocery sales. Overall though, Sainsbury's said that like-for-like sales, excluding fuel and the effect of new shops opening, fell by 4.5% in the three months to 8 January. General merchandise, which includes homeware, toys and other goods from Argos, fell by 16% year-on-year. The group said that it was down to comparisons with a ""strong performance"" during lockdown the previous Christmas, as well as a decision to offer fewer discounts. Toys and tech gadgets in particular suffered with declines seen in the double digits. The retailer said in a statement on Wednesday that global supply chain issues had affected the availability of in-demand products. But the group said cost reductions at Argos, driven by the group's decision to shut 420 of the brand's branches, helped strengthen its profits. Ross Hindle, analyst at Third Bridge, said: ""December's trading was particularly strong for UK supermarkets, with home working translating into home eating and fewer consumers dining out as Omicron swept the country. ""Sainsbury's should be able to hold on to its gains thanks to its loyal customer base and innovation around product lines"", he said, noting that the retailer had added more than 600 new products during the last few months. But he said that rapid delivery firms and discount supermarkets like Aldi or Lidl could still pose a threat. Over the festive period, Sainsbury's fulfilled more than 700,000 online orders per week, with orders on its website and app jumping 41% in the week to Christmas. It also introduced a ""price match"" campaign, which included matching around 150 prices with Aldi in a bid to keep prices lower for customers. The firm recently said that it would become the latest UK supermarket to pay shop workers at least Â£10 an hour. It will increase its basic rate from Â£9.50 to Â£10 an hour for staff across its supermarkets and Argos stores from 6 March, following similar moves by Lidl and Aldi last year. Sainsbury's shares were up 1.75% in early trading in London on Wednesday following its trading update. Tesco and Marks & Spencer are due to release Christmas trading updates on Thursday. Other companies updating on their Christmas performance on Wednesday included JD Sports, Dunelm and Whitbread: Sports retailer JD Sports raised its annual profit forecasts on the back of ""positive"" performances across Christmas and Black Friday. Total sales for the 22 weeks to 1 January were more than 10% ahead of the same period in 2020. The homeware chain Dunelm said it saw a ""record performance"" in the 13 weeks to Christmas, with sales up 13% to Â£407m versus the year before. Premier Inn owner Whitbread said stays at its UK hotels had remained strong in recent weeks, despite the spread of Omicron. But its food and drink sales dipped.

Donations help fire-hit antique book shop re-open,"An aerial ladder platform was used to dampen the fire down Less than two months after a fire destroyed more than Â£1m worth of rare and second-hand books at a warehouse, staff prepare to re-open at a new site. About 400,000 bookswere lost in the blaze at Berwyn Books in Buckley, Flintshire in November,including many unique and historic works. But the public has rallied to help the business rise from the ashes by donating a large number books. They will now be sold from a community centre in Mynydd Isa, near Mold. Antique book firm units destroyed by fire Old and rare books among 400,000 destroyed in fire 'So much history has been lost with these books' Co-owner Katrina Matthews said some changes had been made, after the original owner took a step back. ""Myself and a few colleagues said we'll start a new business, keep the name quite similar but be a separate legal entity. Hence we've changed to The Berwyn Bookshop,"" she said. Everything was lost after fire tore through the company's two warehouses, including a book signed by Queen Victoria and a first edition of the Radio Times from 1923. But most members of staff decided they wanted to try to restart the business in some form. A first ever edition of the Radio Times, published on 28 September in 1923, was lost in the fire Co-owner Emma Littler said: ""Myself and Katrina and our staff were really lucky that everybody was of the same opinion that we wanted to continue this. ""Having that support from our community and customers and family really spurred us on to do that."" Katrina added that the publicity generated in the wake of the fire had led to major donations of books, which have been housed in various locations while a search was under way for a permanent home. ""They've been stored everywhere you can think of,"" she said. ""Buckley Football Club had two big shipping containers full of book donations, Lester's Farm Shop helped. They're also all in my conservatory, in my lounge, in my nan's garage, in my colleague's garage. They're just everywhere, so my home is now a bookshop and not an actual home."" The bookshop was offered a new venue not far from its original base, thanks to Sara Parker at Caffi Isa, a community and arts centre. ""Sara is our fairy godmother,"" said Emma. ""We can't thank her enough. ""Not only has she jeopardised space for her business by providing storage for us, she also provided us a lifeline in terms of our new shop. We're incredibly thankful and it's taken the pressure off. The space is just perfect."" Before the bookshop opens its doors on 5 February, the hard work has begun to get the stock on display and ready for sale. Staff have appealed for donations of fixtures and fittings, boxes and bookcases.

"Quebec to impose health tax on unvaccinatedThe unvaccinated represent 15% of the population, but over half of all hospital admissions.","The Canadian province of Quebec will charge a health tax to residents who are not vaccinated against Covid-19. Quebec, which has seen the highest number of Covid-related deaths in Canada, is currently struggling with a  surge in cases. On Tuesday, the premier announced that it would be the first in the nation to financially penalise the unvaccinated. Only about 12.8% of Quebec residents are not vaccinated, but they make up nearly a third of all hospital cases. According to federal data, just over 85% of Quebec residents had received at least one vaccine dose by 1 January. Premier Francois Legault said during a news conference that people who have not received their first dose of vaccine will have to pay a ""contribution"". The fee has not yet been decided, but will be ""significant"", he said. ""I think right now it's a question of fairness for the 90% of the population who made some sacrifices,"" Mr Legault said. ""I think we owe them this kind of measure."" Last week, the province announced that it would require proof of vaccination to shop in government cannabis and liquor stores. A curfew is also in place, the second one of the pandemic, running from 22:00 to 05:00 each day. On Tuesday, Quebec's death toll from Covid reached 12,028. It comes after 62 deaths were recorded in the previous 24-hour period. The daily figure represents a similar rate to January 2021, before widespread vaccinations had begun in the province. The percentage of Covid patients in intensive care who have not been vaccinated is 45%, provincial data shows. The premier's press conference was attended by his interim public health director, who took over after the long-serving previous director resigned over criticism of his handling of the latest Omicron-driven surge. Hospitals in Montreal, the province's largest city, are nearing 100% capacity and have already started limiting non-Covid related care. Over 200 members of the city's unhoused population have also tested positive, indicating an outbreak. It comes amid a severe cold snap, which is overwhelming shelters. Quebec reported 8,710 new cases on Tuesday. The figure represents a 20% positivity rate. There are currently 2,742 Covid patients in Quebec hospitals, including 244 in intensive care. While rare, Quebec is not the only region in the world seeking to impose a financial penalty on those unwilling to get jabbed. Starting later this month, Greeks over age 60 are being required to pay a â¬100 (Â£85; C$142; $113) fine for each month that they remain unvaccinated.

British Gas owner warns of two-year energy crisis,"This video can not be played Chris O'Shea is chief executive of British Gas owner Centrica Soaring energy prices which threaten the living standards of millions could last up to two years, the boss of the UK's biggest energy supplier has said. Chris O'Shea, chief executive of British Gas owner Centrica, said there was ""no reason"" to expect gas prices would come down ""any time soon"". He said hopes that bills rising by more than 50% to about Â£2,000 a year would be short-lived may be misplaced. Rising energy bills have raised concerns over the cost of living. ""The market suggests the high gas prices will be here for the next 18 months to two years,"" Mr O'Shea told the BBC. 'My energy bill has already risen by Â£60 a month' Why are gas prices so high? Energy firm sorry over pet-cuddling warmth advice Many countries see gas as an intermediate solution while they wean themselves off more carbon-intensive energy sources, such as oil and coal, creating an international dash for gas as the world economy wakes up after its Covid-related slumber. ""As we move towards net zero, gas is a big transition fuel,"" Mr O'Shea said. ""And so as you turn off coal-fired power stations in other countries, there isn't an abundance of gas that you can just turn on quickly."" The idea of re-badging gas as a ""transitional fuel"", rather than as a traditional hydrocarbon, has growing political support and has encouraged those calling for increased investment in boosting the supply of gas from domestic sources such as the North Sea. Are you worried about the rising cost of energy bills? How will it affect you? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external WhatsApp:+44 7756 165803,external OrUpload your pictures/video here Tweet:@BBC_HaveYourSay,external Please read ourterms & conditionsandprivacy policy However, Mr O'Shea was doubtful that higher levels of UK-sourced gas would have made much difference to surging prices. ""I'm not sure an increase in UK supply would have brought the price down from Â£3 a therm, as it was in December, from 50p as it was a year ago,"" he said. ""We bring gas in from the United States, from Norway, from Europe, from Qatar, from other places. So we're not in a position to simply have the UK as an isolated energy market. We are part of a global market."" Mr O'Shea suggested three moves the government could make to help households cope with what has been described as a ""cost of living crisis"". Defer the cost incurred by surviving suppliers from taking on customers of the many companies that have gone bust, rather than it be added to upcoming bills. Take the 5% VAT off energy temporarily or permanently. Move levies charged to fund a green transition from bills to general taxation. ""Those three things together, could be enacted very quickly, without regret,"" he said. ""And that would take care of half of the price rise. And then you could get a further relief targeted to those households that needed most."" Government officials have discussed targeting relief through changes to the warm homes discount plan, which currently offers a one-off payment of Â£140 to those in receipt of certain benefits. Sir Ed Davey, leader of the Liberal Democrats, has proposed increasing that payment to Â£300 and widening the number of people eligible. Mr O'Shea said the current design of the scheme would see relief for some result in rises in everyone else's bills. ""The way the warm homes discount works is that the cost of that scheme is met by customers. So if you increase it, you increase energy bills and we think that whatever relief comes is got to not be at the expense of hard-pressed energy consumers,"" he added. Another option proposed by some in the energy industry is to find a way to provide support to energy companies via loans or a fund, which firms could borrow from when wholesale prices are high and pay back once they've fallen. But according to Mr O'Shea, that plan would rely on the assumption that prices would fall which he said might be wishful thinking. ""Ultimately, everybody in the UK is a taxpayer and an energy consumer. So the cost of this is going to have to be paid by UK citizens,"" he added. ""The question as to whether that's paid for the energy bill, or for general taxation is one for government."" The government has indicated it will decide on what support it will offer before the new energy price cap, which is the maximum rate suppliers can charge for a default tariff, is set on 7 February.

Biden pushes election laws overhaul in fiery speech,"President Biden said the drive to pass his sweeping voting legislation was a ""battle for the soul of America"" US President Joe Biden has called for a historic change to Senate rules as he seeks to overhaul the country's election laws. In an impassioned speech, he said he supported changes that would allow his voting reforms to be passed without the support of opposition Republicans. Misgivings from two senators in his party are hampering his plans, and no Republicans have backed them. Currently, a majority of 60% is needed to pass most legislation in the Senate. And with the upper chamber of Congress split 50-50 between the two parties, Mr Biden's sweeping election bills are almost certain not to pass unless there is a change to that rule. Such a change is unlikely, analysts say, as it would require the support of every Democrat in the Senate as well as the tie-breaking vote of the vice-president. The bills - the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act - passed the lower chamber, the House of Representatives, last year. The former would introduce standardised, nationwide, voting rules as opposed to the current patchwork of state-by-state rules. The John Lewis Act, meanwhile, would require certain states to obtain government permission for any change to election regulations. ANALYSIS: Is this now Joe Biden's biggest headache? CONTEXT: What is the filibuster and why does it matter? ""To protect our democracy, I support changing the Senate rules, whichever way they need to be changed, to prevent a minority of senators from blocking action on voting rights,"" the president said in a speech in Georgia on Tuesday. ""I've been having these quiet conversations with members of Congress for the last two months. I'm tired of being quiet,"" he added, while banging his fist on the lectern. Mr Biden said the push to pass the legislation was a ""battle for the soul of America"", adding that the 60-vote rule - known as the filibuster - had rendered the Senate ""a shell of its former self"". For much of the Senate's history unlimited debate was allowed, enabling opponents to block legislation. Supporters say it is a check on government power and forces administrations to seek consensus. During World War One, rules were adopted to allow a two-thirds majority to bring debate to an end, but it was rarely used, and reduced to the 60-vote rule during the 1970s. Joe Biden is making a renewed push for voting legislation, but the prospects for success haven't changed much since congressional Democrats first advanced the current package of proposals back in January 2019. They're dim. The reasons should be familiar to this White House. Either Democrats need to attract Republican support in the Senate, or they must change the rules to allow the slim Democratic majority there to approve the legislation on its own. Neither seems likely, no matter how many speeches Mr Biden gives. Mr Biden's Georgia trip could simply be an attempt to satisfy restive members of his party's base, who believe the president is not doing enough to promote what they see as the most important issue facing the nation - and their party - today. But the outlook for success there doesn't look great, either. Some prominent voting rights activists are giving the Atlanta event a pass, viewing it as too little, too late. Even Stacey Abrams, the Georgia gubernatorial candidate and tireless advocate of Democratic reforms, was absent, citing ""scheduling conflicts"". Mr Biden may describe the coming voting rights showdown as a national ""turning point"", but the momentum is currently in a direction Democrats won't like. Forecasts for this year's mid-term elections have spurred a sense of urgency among Democrats. Political analysts say the party risks losing control of Congress, and voting reform advocates have expressed frustration that the White House has not acted sooner. Mr Biden said he was ""an institutionalist who was honoured to serve in the Senate"" for years, but he argued ""the threat to our democracy is so grave"" that he felt rule changes were necessary. But in 2019, Mr Biden warned that doing away with the filibuster would be ""very dangerous"", pointing out that his fellow Democrats have used the rule often to block Republican legislation. Back in 2005, Mr Biden said any attempt to eliminate the filibuster was ""an example of the arrogance of power"". Former President Donald Trump called for the filibuster to be scrapped when his fellow Republicans controlled the Senate, but then-Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell refused to go for ""the nuclear option"" as it is known on Capitol Hill. Republicans have argued that Mr Biden's voting legislation would impose questionable national standards on local elections. Speaking after the president's speech, Republican Senator Mike Capo said the two bills were a ""partisan, political power grab"" and voiced opposition to changing Senate rules. Jazmin Kay, 24, is a New York Democrat and the president of youth-voting advocacy group 18by.vote. She is glad to see the president talking about expanding voting access, but wants to see Congress pass legislation that would guarantee reform. ""We're frustrated with all the bureaucracy around voting rights,"" she says. ""If we don't have comprehensive voting rights reform, then we're not able to have a say in what is done in our government. Enthusiasm is waning [among younger Americans]."" Ryan Doucette, 18, is an Ohio Republican and chief of staff to the young conservatives at Gen Z GOP. He warns that one-size-fits-all electoral reform by the federal government is ""wildly misguided"" and ""rooted in cookie-cutter solutions"". ""Democrats incorrectly say Republicans are systematically trying to disenfranchise voters of colour, while some outspoken Republicans falsely claim that elections are rife with fraud,"" he says. ""Every community in America faces different voting rights challenges, and those should be addressed via sound policy for each distinct challenge."" Senate Democrats are planning to hold a debate in the next week on scrapping the filibuster. But two centrist Democrats - Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema - have indicated they will not go along. Other Senate Democrats, including Arizona's Mark Kelly, Montana's Jon Tester and Delaware's Chris Coons - have suggested they are on the fence. Republican-run states have introduced restrictions on access and verification since the 2020 election. They claim widespread voter fraud, though little concrete evidence has come to light.

PM to face MPs following drinks party revelations,"The PM is set to face questions he has so far declined to answer Conservative and opposition MPs are demanding answers from Boris Johnson over whether he attended a drinks event in the No 10 garden during lockdown. Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner said that if he was there, and he lied about it, his position is ""untenable"". And Tory MPs have been expressing their anger and concern over the reports. Mr Johnson will take Prime Minister's Questions at noon - his first public appearance since details of the May 2020 event emerged. The prime minister has so far declined to say whether he attended the gathering, but witnesses have told the BBC both he and his wife were among 30 people at the drinks. Sort it out or step aside, Tory donor tells PM The list of alleged government lockdown gatherings Tory MPs send angry message to Boris Johnson The PM's performance in the Commons will be closely watched by Conservative MPs, some of whom are understood to have privately called for a leadership challenge to Mr Johnson. A contest will take place if 54 Conservative MPs send letters to the backbench 1922 committee. Senior Tory backbencher Tobias Ellwood said the prime minister needed to apologise for his actions, ""show some contrition"" and get a grip of the situation or he will be ""out of office"". Conservative MP David Simmonds told BBC London: ""We're all pretty frustrated with the situation. The PM is going to have to start answering some questions about it today."" He said holding a party in lockdown was ""clearly indefensible"" and it should not be impossible for Mr Johnson to say whether he was there or not. Backbencher Nigel Mills told BBC Newsnight: ""If the prime minister knowingly attended a party, I can't see how he can survive."" On Tuesday, Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said Mr Johnson must quit if he was found to have broken Covid rules. What rules would the Downing Street party have broken? Analysis: Tory mood turns sour On Monday,ITV published a leaked email,externalfrom Mr Johnson's principal private secretary, Martin Reynolds, inviting staff to ""socially distanced drinks in the No 10 garden"" on 20 May 2020 - when lockdown rules in England banned large outdoor gatherings. The invitation encouraged people to ""bring your own booze"" and ""make the most of the lovely weather"". Mr Johnson has said it is a matter for Sue Gray - the senior civil servant investigating a series of reported parties in Downing Street and in Whitehall in 2020 - to determine what happened. The PM's official spokesman has also refused to confirm whether Mr Johnson attended the May 2020 Downing Street gathering. He added that the prime minister retained full confidence in Mr Reynolds.

He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he didn't believe Mr Johnson should resign, hailing government achievements including the successful vaccination rollout and the prime minister ""holding his nerve"" on refusing to introduce further Covid rules in England.

You can't! It's embarrassing and what's worse is it further erodes trust in politics when it's already low."" And in an email to her constituent, Caroline Nokes said: ""I have no words that can adequately express how angry I am at the 'don't do as I do, do as I say' attitude that appears to have prevailed in Downing Street."" Questions are being raised about the role of the civil service too, with former senior civil servant Sir David Normington telling Radio 4's Today programme calling a party in the middle of lockdown was ""inexplicable"". ""It's a terrible misjudgement, brings disrepute on the civil service. This isn't just about the responsibilities of PMs and politicians, it's also about the behaviour and responsibilities of senior civil servants. That's a very serious matter."" Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner told BBC Breakfast if Mr Johnson had broken Covid rules and lied to the public and parliament, then his position as prime minister was now ""untenable"". ""The prime minister cannot break the law, lie to the British public and not be held to account for that,"" she added.

He added Mr Johnson was ""incapable of leading our country through this public health crisis"", accusing him of being a ""threat to the health of the nation"" as the public would not listen to anything he had to say. If the prime minister won't resign, it was the duty of Conservative MPs to ""do the right thing"" and ensure he does ""in the interests of the country"", Sir Ed argued. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer will return to Prime Minister's Questions later, having missed last week's session after contracting Covid. The BBC has been told that Mr Johnson will not make a separate statement on parties in the House of Commons but a senior government source didn't rule out him making some remarks at the start of Prime Minister's Questions. The goodwill-to-all-men moment the Christmas holidays promised is very much over. The subject of conversation among Tories on Tuesday was not the government's planned menu of policy fare for the week, but whether or not the moment had arrived when Boris Johnson, election-winner, had become Boris Johnson, discredited liability. Whether or not, in the words of that senior MP, the party should ""get rid of him"". The party has not reached that conclusion. The government has an enormous majority. Administrations go through rocky times. But the latest, and continuing, stream of revelations, has made the question of the prime minister's survival the central one again. Read more from Laura here. On Tuesday, Mr Johnson sent Paymaster General Michael Ellis to respond on his behalf to an emergency Commons question on the issue tabled by Labour. The Conservative benches were sparsely populated, while no senior ministers appeared publicly to defend Mr Johnson. During the session, DUP MP Jim Shannon was brought to tears when speaking of the death of his mother-in-law during the pandemic. In December, the prime minister asked for an independent inquiry to investigate a series of allegations about events taking place in government buildings in 2020 despite coronavirus restrictions being in force. Ms Gray's probe is investigating specific eventsincluding a leaving drinks for a No 10 aide on 27 November, a Department of Education gathering on 10 December and a Christmas quiz for No 10 staff on 15 December. It is also examining the Downing Street Christmas party on 18 December, and on Tuesday, Mr Ellis said drinks events held in the Downing Street garden on 20 and 15 May 2020 would also be added to the inquiry.

Biden calls for 'turning point' on election laws,"President Biden said the drive to pass his sweeping voting legislation was a ""battle for the soul of America"" US President Joe Biden has called for a historic change to Senate rules as he seeks to overhaul the country's election laws. In an impassioned speech, he said he supported changes that would allow his voting reforms to be passed without the support of opposition Republicans. Misgivings from two senators in his party are hampering his plans, and no Republicans have backed them. Currently, a majority of 60% is needed to pass most legislation in the Senate. And with the upper chamber of Congress split 50-50 between the two parties, Mr Biden's sweeping election bills are almost certain not to pass unless there is a change to that rule. Such a change is unlikely, analysts say, as it would require the support of every Democrat in the Senate as well as the tie-breaking vote of the vice-president. The bills - the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act - passed the lower chamber, the House of Representatives, last year. The former would introduce standardised, nationwide, voting rules as opposed to the current patchwork of state-by-state rules. The John Lewis Act, meanwhile, would require certain states to obtain government permission for any change to election regulations. ANALYSIS: Is this now Joe Biden's biggest headache? CONTEXT: What is the filibuster and why does it matter? ""To protect our democracy, I support changing the Senate rules, whichever way they need to be changed, to prevent a minority of senators from blocking action on voting rights,"" the president said in a speech in Georgia on Tuesday. ""I've been having these quiet conversations with members of Congress for the last two months. I'm tired of being quiet,"" he added, while banging his fist on the lectern. Mr Biden said the push to pass the legislation was a ""battle for the soul of America"", adding that the 60-vote rule - known as the filibuster - had rendered the Senate ""a shell of its former self"". For much of the Senate's history unlimited debate was allowed, enabling opponents to block legislation. Supporters say it is a check on government power and forces administrations to seek consensus. During World War One, rules were adopted to allow a two-thirds majority to bring debate to an end, but it was rarely used, and reduced to the 60-vote rule during the 1970s. Joe Biden is making a renewed push for voting legislation, but the prospects for success haven't changed much since congressional Democrats first advanced the current package of proposals back in January 2019. They're dim. The reasons should be familiar to this White House. Either Democrats need to attract Republican support in the Senate, or they must change the rules to allow the slim Democratic majority there to approve the legislation on its own. Neither seems likely, no matter how many speeches Mr Biden gives. Mr Biden's Georgia trip could simply be an attempt to satisfy restive members of his party's base, who believe the president is not doing enough to promote what they see as the most important issue facing the nation - and their party - today. But the outlook for success there doesn't look great, either. Some prominent voting rights activists are giving the Atlanta event a pass, viewing it as too little, too late. Even Stacey Abrams, the Georgia gubernatorial candidate and tireless advocate of Democratic reforms, was absent, citing ""scheduling conflicts"". Mr Biden may describe the coming voting rights showdown as a national ""turning point"", but the momentum is currently in a direction Democrats won't like. Forecasts for this year's mid-term elections have spurred a sense of urgency among Democrats. Political analysts say the party risks losing control of Congress, and voting reform advocates have expressed frustration that the White House has not acted sooner. Mr Biden said he was ""an institutionalist who was honoured to serve in the Senate"" for years, but he argued ""the threat to our democracy is so grave"" that he felt rule changes were necessary. But in 2019, Mr Biden warned that doing away with the filibuster would be ""very dangerous"", pointing out that his fellow Democrats have used the rule often to block Republican legislation. Back in 2005, Mr Biden said any attempt to eliminate the filibuster was ""an example of the arrogance of power"". Former President Donald Trump called for the filibuster to be scrapped when his fellow Republicans controlled the Senate, but then-Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell refused to go for ""the nuclear option"" as it is known on Capitol Hill. Republicans have argued that Mr Biden's voting legislation would impose questionable national standards on local elections. Speaking after the president's speech, Republican Senator Mike Capo said the two bills were a ""partisan, political power grab"" and voiced opposition to changing Senate rules. Jazmin Kay, 24, is a New York Democrat and the president of youth-voting advocacy group 18by.vote. She is glad to see the president talking about expanding voting access, but wants to see Congress pass legislation that would guarantee reform. ""We're frustrated with all the bureaucracy around voting rights,"" she says. ""If we don't have comprehensive voting rights reform, then we're not able to have a say in what is done in our government. Enthusiasm is waning [among younger Americans]."" Ryan Doucette, 18, is an Ohio Republican and chief of staff to the young conservatives at Gen Z GOP. He warns that one-size-fits-all electoral reform by the federal government is ""wildly misguided"" and ""rooted in cookie-cutter solutions"". ""Democrats incorrectly say Republicans are systematically trying to disenfranchise voters of colour, while some outspoken Republicans falsely claim that elections are rife with fraud,"" he says. ""Every community in America faces different voting rights challenges, and those should be addressed via sound policy for each distinct challenge."" Senate Democrats are planning to hold a debate in the next week on scrapping the filibuster. But two centrist Democrats - Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema - have indicated they will not go along. Other Senate Democrats, including Arizona's Mark Kelly, Montana's Jon Tester and Delaware's Chris Coons - have suggested they are on the fence. Republican-run states have introduced restrictions on access and verification since the 2020 election. They claim widespread voter fraud, though little concrete evidence has come to light.

British Gas owner warns of two year energy crisis,"This video can not be played Chris O'Shea is chief executive of British Gas owner Centrica Soaring energy prices which threaten the living standards of millions could last up to two years, the boss of the UK's biggest energy supplier has said. Chris O'Shea, chief executive of British Gas owner Centrica, said there was ""no reason"" to expect gas prices would come down ""any time soon"". He said hopes that bills rising by more than 50% to about Â£2,000 a year would be short-lived may be misplaced. Rising energy bills have raised concerns over the cost of living. ""The market suggests the high gas prices will be here for the next 18 months to two years,"" Mr O'Shea told the BBC. 'My energy bill has already risen by Â£60 a month' Why are gas prices so high? Energy firm sorry over pet-cuddling warmth advice Many countries see gas as an intermediate solution while they wean themselves off more carbon-intensive energy sources, such as oil and coal, creating an international dash for gas as the world economy wakes up after its Covid-related slumber. ""As we move towards net zero, gas is a big transition fuel,"" Mr O'Shea said. ""And so as you turn off coal-fired power stations in other countries, there isn't an abundance of gas that you can just turn on quickly."" The idea of re-badging gas as a ""transitional fuel"", rather than as a traditional hydrocarbon, has growing political support and has encouraged those calling for increased investment in boosting the supply of gas from domestic sources such as the North Sea. Are you worried about the rising cost of energy bills? How will it affect you? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external WhatsApp:+44 7756 165803,external OrUpload your pictures/video here Tweet:@BBC_HaveYourSay,external Please read ourterms & conditionsandprivacy policy However, Mr O'Shea was doubtful that higher levels of UK-sourced gas would have made much difference to surging prices. ""I'm not sure an increase in UK supply would have brought the price down from Â£3 a therm, as it was in December, from 50p as it was a year ago,"" he said. ""We bring gas in from the United States, from Norway, from Europe, from Qatar, from other places. So we're not in a position to simply have the UK as an isolated energy market. We are part of a global market."" Mr O'Shea suggested three moves the government could make to help households cope with what has been described as a ""cost of living crisis"". Defer the cost incurred by surviving suppliers from taking on customers of the many companies that have gone bust, rather than it be added to upcoming bills. Take the 5% VAT off energy temporarily or permanently. Move levies charged to fund a green transition from bills to general taxation. ""Those three things together, could be enacted very quickly, without regret,"" he said. ""And that would take care of half of the price rise. And then you could get a further relief targeted to those households that needed most."" Government officials have discussed targeting relief through changes to the warm homes discount plan, which currently offers a one-off payment of Â£140 to those in receipt of certain benefits. Sir Ed Davey, leader of the Liberal Democrats, has proposed increasing that payment to Â£300 and widening the number of people eligible. Mr O'Shea said the current design of the scheme would see relief for some result in rises in everyone else's bills. ""The way the warm homes discount works is that the cost of that scheme is met by customers. So if you increase it, you increase energy bills and we think that whatever relief comes is got to not be at the expense of hard-pressed energy consumers,"" he added. Another option proposed by some in the energy industry is to find a way to provide support to energy companies via loans or a fund, which firms could borrow from when wholesale prices are high and pay back once they've fallen. But according to Mr O'Shea, that plan would rely on the assumption that prices would fall which he said might be wishful thinking. ""Ultimately, everybody in the UK is a taxpayer and an energy consumer. So the cost of this is going to have to be paid by UK citizens,"" he added. ""The question as to whether that's paid for the energy bill, or for general taxation is one for government."" The government has indicated it will decide on what support it will offer before the new energy price cap, which is the maximum rate suppliers can charge for a default tariff, is set on 7 February.
