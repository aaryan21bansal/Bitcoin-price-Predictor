"Blair: Afghan withdrawal driven by imbecilic sloganThe ex-PM criticises the US decision to withdraw its military as ""tragic, dangerous, and unnecessary"".UK","This video can not be played Former PM Tony Blair: 'It's not just about the Afghan people... it's about our security' The US withdrawal from Afghanistan was wrong and based on an ""imbecilic"" slogan, former PM Tony Blair has said. He described the decision to withdraw troops from the country as ""tragic, dangerous and unnecessary"". Mr Blair, who sent troops into Afghanistan 20 years ago, said UK involvement in Afghanistan was not a ""hopeless endeavour"" despite the Taliban takeover. And the sacrifice made by British troops ""was not in vain"", he added. Mr Blair said achievements in the country over the past 20 years - including a generation growing up without Taliban rule - was a ""good cause"" that ""matters today"". Speaking to broadcasters, the former Labour leader shared concerns, not only for the Afghan people who he said stood to lose out, but also for the security of Western countries. He said the Taliban ""will give protection and succour to Al Qaeda - you've got Isis trying to operate in the country at the same time"". ""You look round the world and the only people really cheering this decision are the people hostile to Western interests,"" he added. In his online article,,externalhis first statement since Kabul fell to the Taliban last week, Mr Blair said the decision to withdraw was made ""in obedience to an imbecilic political slogan about ending 'the forever wars'"". US tells citizens to avoid Kabul airport The desperate scramble to escape Afghanistan Taliban takeover raises fears about Africa's jihadists Mr Blair said Britain had a ""moral obligation"" to stay in Afghanistan until ""all those who need to be are evacuated"". He wrote on his website: ""We must evacuate and give sanctuary to those to whom we have responsibility - those Afghans who helped us and stood by us and have a right to demand we stand by them."" This should not be done ""grudgingly but out of a deep sense of humanity and responsibility"", he added. On Sunday the Ministry of Defence said seven Afghan civilians had died in the chaotic crowds outside the city's international airport. The US has a planned deadline of 31 August for withdrawal - but President Biden has said troops may stay past this date to help with evacuations. Tony Blair with British forces in Helmand province in 2006 Mr Blair admitted mistakes had been made over Afghanistan, but ""the reaction to our mistakes has been, unfortunately, further mistakes"". He said while ""imperfect"", the ""real gains over the past 20 years"" were now likely to be lost. He said the Afghan economy was now three times larger than when the UK invaded the country alongside the US in 2001 and some 200,000 Afghans went to university this year - including 50,000 women. The withdrawal would have ""every jihadist group around the world cheering"", he said. Russia, China and Iran will take advantage, he said, adding: ""Anyone given commitments by Western leaders will understandably regard them as unstable currency."" Peter Galbraith, former UN deputy special representative for Afghanistan, said all the coalition partners bore responsibility for the chaos unfolding. ""In terms of what was imbecilic, frankly it was the strategy that was followed for 20 years, which was to try to build a highly centralised state in a country that was as diverse - geographically and ethnically - as Afghanistan, and to engage in a counterinsurgency strategy without a local partner and the local partner was corrupt, ineffective, illegitimate,"" he said. He added that coalition partners ""never seriously tried to address the corruption that was prevalent from the top"", acquiescing in ""fraudulent"" Afghan elections, and trying to fit facts into a predetermined strategy, ""rather than having a strategy that was based on the facts"". Mum fears son's Afghanistan death ""was for nothing"" 'Our lads were making a difference' UK veterans seeking mental health support President Biden hasvowed that ""any American who wants to come home, we will get you home"", but has described the evacuation as one of the ""most difficult airlifts in history"". Mr Blair's intervention comes as shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy has urged her government counterpart Dominic Raab to step up efforts to get British and eligible Afghans to the UK. She said she hadheard of people being beaten, shot at or rapedwhile trying to get documentation in Kabul. The Foreign Office said it was trying to get people out as fast as possible, with more than 3,000 people having been evacuated from the country since last Sunday. In an article in theMail on Sunday,external, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said the West's exit from Afghanistan was ""unedifying"" and would have ""consequences for us all for years to come"". He praised the British soldiers working at Kabul's airport for dealing with ""unimaginable challenges - public order, overcrowding, searing heat and desperate people"". ""Soldiers trained for war are instead holding babies and co-ordinating crowds,"" he wrote. Mr Wallace said there was ""no time to lose"" to get people out of the country but added the US would have his complete support if it chose to push back the deadline for leaving.

Travel test firms warned over misleading prices,"More than 80 private Covid travel test providers listed on the government's website will be issued two-strike warnings over misleading prices, Health Secretary Sajid Javid has announced. A further 57 firms will be removed from the website on Monday, because they either no longer exist or do not actually provide the relevant tests. The health secretary said the move was to clamp down on ""cowboy behaviour"". The government will also introduce spot checks on the test providers. Which countries are on the green list? Anger at overflowing Covid test drop boxes Tui to subsidise Covid tests for customers The UK government has made it a condition of international travel to England that tests before travel, and on your arrival in the UK are mandatory. The number of tests that are needed is dependent on your arrival from either a green or amber country or your vaccination status. Arrivals from red countries must still use quarantine hotel facilities. The government website has a list of private companies that offer such tests - but a recent review by the Department of Health found the prices displayed were lower on the Gov.UK site than the actual amount they cost. Some of the most common complaints from travellers also mention testslisted on the government's list of providers,externalthat do not exist at the price advertised, whilst others allege poor service. Mr Javid said: ""It is absolutely unacceptable for any private testing company to be taking advantage of holidaymakers and today's action clamps down on this cowboy behaviour. ""57 firms will be removed from the Gov.UK list and a further 82 will be given a two-strike warning - if they advertise misleading prices ever again, they're off."" He added that the spot checks being introduced were to ensure that all private providers ""follow the rules"" and meet the government's ""high standards of transparency"". But consumer group Which? said that it had warned the government about the problems with private travel test providers six months ago. ""It's welcome news that the government is finally taking responsibility for its list of test providers and carrying out an audit, but it's six months late,"" Rory Boland, travel editor at consumer association Which?, told the BBC. Multiple advertisements for private Covid travel tests can now be seen on UK public transport ""There should not have been providers listed on the Gov.UK website that don't exist. We found this inour first investigation,externalin April, when providers were telling us that the system would collapse if larger numbers of people were travelling."" He added that Which? had repeatedly reported some Covid test providers to the government: ""In our second investigation, we looked at the 10 cheapest providers and we found that none of the tests listed below Â£80, were actually attainable for less than that. ""We submitted the names to the government and they removed three of those 10 names in June."" While the government has not named the providers that it intends to remove from the Gov.UK website, or the firms that will be receiving warnings, Which? says it is certain that the test providers offering Covid tests that start from Â£20 will be targeted. Mr Boland said: ""You can't get the Â£20 tests. We haven't met anyone who's had a Â£20 test. Generally the price you pay, at the cheaper end, is Â£40-Â£50. ""A lot of these firms offering Â£20 tests require you to drive to somewhere in England on a specific day, such as in Middlesbrough. When you try to book the test online, the booking calendar is almost always full."" In April, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told MPs that some travel tests had fallen to below Â£45, saying he was ""very anxious"" to reduce the cost of the tests for consumers. Last week,the Competition and Markets Authority's former chairman, Lord Tyrie, accused it of not doing enough to protect consumers, saying that PCR testing for travel had become a ""predictable Covid rip-off"". In response, the business and competition regulator told the BBC it warned government officials that consumers could face risks from the fast-growing travel testing industry in April and May. Government was told in April of PCR test 'rip-off' Anger at overflowing Covid test drop boxes Tui to subsidise Covid tests for customers How are travel rules being relaxed?

Teen footballer wants better care for young adults,"Hollie spent months in hospital and nearly died after a kidney infection led to sepsis and a cardiac arrest A teenager who dreamed of a place in Wales' national football team says there needs to be better care for young adults, after sepsis left her disabled. Hollie Smith, 19, from Cardiff, was set for a trial to get into the women's team when she was struck down by a kidney infection last year. It developed into sepsis, her heart stopped, and the young striker was left needing round-the-clock care. Hollie said more care facilities for young people were urgently needed. Sepsis test could cut diagnosis time to minutes ""When I woke up from my cardiac arrest, I had lost the use of my right side - I could no longer stand, sit up, eat, dress, look after or wash and toilet myself,"" said Hollie. ""Considering I was about to trial for the Welsh national football ladies' team before going into hospital this was all a bit of a shock."" Promising young footballer Hollie was about to have a trial for the Wales football team when she became ill Hollie was a healthy 18-year-old before sepsis struck Amid struggles with her mental health as she tried to adapt to such a brutal change, Hollie underwent months of intensive physiotherapy, which restored some of the movement she had lost. On returning home from hospital in December, she faced a new routine of two carers, four times a day, helping her with even the most basic of tasks. After six weeks, disaster struck and she developed sepsis a second time - which affected her kidneys, lungs and brain. Sepsis: Understanding why my dad died NHS help for sepsis survivors 'non-existent' Sepsis survivor in machine call for Wales Hollie was put in an induced coma for more than two weeks and was told she was ""very lucky"" to survive. But life has since consisted of a hospital bed in the living room, with bumpers to protect her from injury when having seizures, a full ceiling hoist, a team of carers, and a daily cocktail of medications. Just weeks after returning home, Hollie developed sepsis for a second time and was put in an induced coma ""I can't do the most basic of tasks, whereas I'm watching other people my age going to university and driving, and what a normal teenager or young adult should be doing,"" she said. ""It's been pretty horrendous to be honest - I think only now is it all starting to sink in. ""I do try to be positive but at the moment it's quite hard, because with Covid, everything that needs to be done is considerably slower because of the pandemic."" Incredibly - and with a fierce determination common in many sportspeople - the former footballer has been planning for the future and how she could use her experiences to help others. ""My personal goals are to go to college and resit my A-levels in order to give me a stepping stone to go on to university and study medicine. ""I also hope to start campaigning for better young disabled adults' facilities. ""Now, the long-term outlook for recovery is poor. However, I do hope in the future that I will be able to sit up with minimal assistance and be able to propel myself in a wheelchair and find a new sport to get into."" Her family said they hoped to adapt their home to give Hollie as much independence as possible and have also been trying to raise funds for private physiotherapy and a personal-use defibrillator. Hollie added she hoped to have enough for a holiday with carers provided ""so that my parents get a break too"". Hollie's trophies: She's set herself fresh life challenges - including passing her A-levels exams, and wanting to study medicine In the meantime, Hollie has highlighted that although her care has been excellent, there should be better facilities when young people experience sepsis or are learning to adapt to disability. 'Hearing loss isn't stopping me becoming a doctor' ""I've been told that I meet the threshold for residential care. However, the only places I could go would be a care for the elderly facility, or a place for people with learning difficulties, and neither would really be able to meet my needs,"" she said. ""Also in hospital there is a children's hospital but no transition for young adults - I was on a ward with dementia patients and people sometimes four times my age. ""I just want young adults to be able to have more suitable surroundings and activities to do in hospital. Also, even after being in hospital, a lot of social services and facilities care is geared towards the elderly and I just feel that needs to change."" But she was keen to stress that the hospital team at University Hospital of Wales ""were and still are amazing with me and my family and I owe my life to them"". Hollie returned from hospital to a very different life, but is focusing on the future and campaigning for better facilities for other young people Cardiff council said it was ""committed to working with individuals to find the best way of meeting their needs to ensure the best outcomes can be achieved"". ""Although every effort is made to offer different types of facilities and care services so that younger people can live independently whilst accessing the support they need, we do recognise that, due to the city's demographics, many services have a focus on older people. ""That said, care services are regularly reviewed, and in order to identify how we can best deliver high-quality services to younger people with disabilities in Cardiff, a partnership project is due to begin shortly which will help us make improvements which best meet the needs of everyone requiring care in Cardiff. ""Importantly, we will work with Cardiff and Vale University Health Board where care is shared between health and the council."" The health board said its patient experience team had contacted Hollie to share her experience ""including what aspects could have been better"". ""When patients are admitted to hospital they are triaged and are placed on a ward with access to the most appropriate clinical expertise for their needs so they get the right care and treatment at the right time,"" said a Cardiff and Vale health board official. A Welsh government said decision on appropriate care ""should be considered for patients on an individual basis in consultation with the clinician responsible for their care"". It added: ""We expect health boards to ensure there is no loss in the quality of any service provided, there is on-going engagement and good patient experience in the handover and transition of care from paediatric to adult services.""

"'Hey world, do you care what happens here?'","A week after the Taliban takeover of the country, many Afghans are uncertain of what it will mean for their lives and their safety. Here, a young female student shares her fears about her future. The BBC is not identifying her to protect her safety. ""It is the seventh day since the country collapsed, the president escaped, and the Taliban, once again, came to power. We are left behind... Fear has taken over my whole being, and as the days pass, I can feel how hope fades away from within me. It gets replaced with frustration. All I can see is darkness, uncertainty, and a not so bright future. I will be killed certainly. I have reasons to be... This is how it feels when the ones you are afraid of occupy the country. Imagine being on a long road, with no end, with hazy weather; alone. I have witnessed so many hurdles in my life, many that no other girl would be able to tolerate. I could manage to overcome them, but this... Hey world, do you care what happens here? Do we matter to you? Do you see us? Do you? For those who are listening, for those who care, I am writing this. I am saying this. We are suffering here, we are being left behind. Living with fear is no less than death. It is worse. If you are listening to us, help us. Help us survive, and once again believe in light and rise; stronger than before. We want our country back. Want our people to live the way they want, the way they deserve. Tell your countries to stop war - war is ugly, it has a dirty face, it has no winner. The heart is too tiny to bear war, to bear its consequences. We are the fruit of war, some young girls drown in uncertainties, in fear, in doubts... looking for somebody to help us survive. Looking at our families and crying for being unable to do anything. Looking at the sky and asking from him: do you see us, will you help us? Shall I have hope, that little hope! Hey world, hey people living out there, lucky you! I envy the life you live. Look at us. I was the one with so many big dreams, dreams of helping others and now I am seeking help. This is war. Will I be able to ever say: We did it? We could make it? Will I?""

Is PM's Irish Sea tunnel vision a pipe dream?,"A tunnel could be built under the Irish Sea stretching from Portpatrick in Scotland Dominic Cummings has described it as ""the world's most stupid tunnel to Ireland"". Many others agree with the prime minister's former chief adviser, that Boris Johnson's tunnel vision is a bit of a joke, pie in the sky, a vanity project. But another of Mr Johnson's former aides, Guto Harri, thinks that the idea shouldn't be dismissed entirely. Mr Harri said Mr Johnson has ""serious intent"". ""He wants to maintain the union and he wants to persuade the rest of the world that we're still big players and can build big things - and what would be bigger than a tunnel under the Irish Sea, linking Scotland and Northern Ireland?"" he said. Mr Harri has been interviewed for Boris's Tunnel Vision, a documentary co-production for BBC Radio Ulster and Radio Scotland. He was Boris Johnson's communications director for four years when the now prime minister was Mayor of London and he remembers how enthusiastic Mr Johnson was about a proposal to build a third London Airport in the Thames Estuary. ""I remember him ringing up a Tory MP in the House of Commons and singing Dolly Parton's 'Islands in the Stream. that is what we are' down the phone to him,"" he said. Guto Harri is a former GB News and BBC journalist, as well as a former advisor to Boris Johnson when he was Mayor of London ""He made it look as if it was a joke, but he was very serious."" In the end, Mr Harri said, a lack of finance and authority forced Mr Johnson to abandon his floating airport project. Scotland-NI bridge considered in UK transport study Could we build a Scotland-Northern Ireland bridge? Just 12 miles separate Ireland and Scotland at the closest point - cultural and trade links go back centuries and ideas about a fixed link between the two countries have been put forward occasionally since the late 1800s. It's a stormy stretch of water and there's the small matter of thousands of tonnes of World War Two munitions dumped in the Beaufort Dyke, a deep trench which runs down the middle of the Irish Sea. Nevertheless, Boris Johnson has asked Sir Peter Hendy, the Network Rail Chairman, to include the idea of an Irish Sea fixed link in his major review of the UK's road, rail and air infrastructure. Portpatrick would be the proposed Scottish terminus of the tunnel It's due to be published in the next few weeks. Scottish architect, Prof Alan Dunlop, is one of the most enthusiastic supporters of the prime minister's plan. He has drawn up his own design, modelled on the 650-mile Norwegian Coastal Highway, currently under construction, which will consist of a series of bridges and ""floating tunnels"". Prof Dunlop's 'floating tunnel' would be connected and secured to the seabed by cables, similar to technology used on North Sea oil rigs. He argues this would overcome challenges posed by the weather and the Beaufort Dyke, and that the tunnel would be a monumental engineering success as well as a vital economic and cultural link for two close neighbours. It sounds far-fetched but tunnelling expert Mike Savill, of the international engineering company Mott MacDonald, said the idea would be worthy of serious consideration if the plan moves a step forward in the Hendy Review. He told the BBC: ""If you ask an engineer can you build it, he will always say yes - but in the end it will be the politicians and the transport planners who will decide. It will always be driven by political will."" However, political opinion in Scotland and Northern Ireland is sharply divided. Scottish Conservatives and Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionists are, not surprisingly, enthusiastic. They argue that a tunnel would help cement their place in the union and boost trade and employment. Galloway and West Dumfries Conservative MSP (member of the Scottish Parliament), Finlay Carson, said he supports the idea for political and economic reasons. Conservative MSP Finlay Carson said the link could help the economy He said his priority was to see the A75 - the road linking Stranraer on the west coast to Gretna Green - improved but that he'd ""welcome anything which might help improve links between the so-called Northern Powerhouse and Scotland's Central Belt, right to the coast and across the Irish Sea"". Scotland-Northern Ireland bridge idea investigated UK's undersea 'ticking timebombs',external However, the Holyrood and Stormont transport ministers, Graeme Dey of the Scottish National Party (SNP) and Nichola Mallon of the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP), are strongly opposed. They believe it would be a colossal waste of money, which would be better spent on more pressing projects and, what's more, they see it as a Westminster power grab. ""This has been plucked out of thin air - there is no real substance to it,"" Mr Dey said. Ms Mallon said the tunnel would eat up funds required elsewhere ""It's been deeply disrespectful to devolution, another example where Boris Johnston is stepping into the devolved sphere,"" said Ms Mallon. East Antrim MP, Sammy Wilson of the DUP, said a tunnel would have to be a UK-wide project: ""If you left it to the individual devolved administrations, nothing like this would ever be built, because their aims would never coincide. ""The Scottish Nationalists would have their priorities and we'll have ours and they'll tend to be local, because of course we'll be chasing after local votes."" Portpatrick, on the Galloway coast, was once a busy mail boat route to Donaghadee, in County Down. Its hinterland is being suggested as a possible entrance/exit point for the tunnel, should it ever get the go-ahead. Locals and visitors spoke to the programme about the idea of a tunnel connecting the devolved regions. ""I think it would be good,"" said one woman enjoying the sunshine and the view across the Irish Sea. ""Scotland and Ireland are good neighbours aren't they?"" A passer-by whistles when told the projected cost of a tunnel could be Â£20bn. ""Whew - would that money not be better spent on the health service?"" he said. Another echoes Dominic Cummings' view: ""I think it's the stupidest idea I've ever heard."" In Portpatrick views are mixed on whether the tunnel is a good idea Guto Harri said that, with bigger priorities such as the National Health Service and social care reform, it is more likely, on balance, that the tunnel will not be built. ""But it is far from impossible,"" he added. ""The reality with Boris Johnson is that he could be prime minister for a long period of time. ""He could be out by Christmas, but if he is to be there for the best part of a decade, then this is an idea I think he would come back to. Then I think it more likely than not that this would get done."" Sir Peter Hendy's independent review is due to report soon.  Perhaps then we'll find out more about the feasibility of Boris's Tunnel Vision under what the Ulster-Scots call 'The Narrow Sea'. 'Boris's Tunnel Vision' will be broadcast on BBC Radio Scotland on Sunday 22 August at 11:30 BST. It will be broadcast on BBC Radio Ulster on Friday 27 August at 17:30 and repeated on Bank Holiday Monday 30 August at 12:30. The programme is a Yamal Production, presented by Mark Simpson and produced by John Deering. Scotland-NI bridge considered in UK transport study Could we build a Scotland-Northern Ireland bridge?

"Teen footballer wants better care for young adultsHollie Smith, 19, dreamed of playing for Wales - but after sepsis she needs round-the-clock care.","Hollie spent months in hospital and nearly died after a kidney infection led to sepsis and a cardiac arrest A teenager who dreamed of a place in Wales' national football team says there needs to be better care for young adults, after sepsis left her disabled. Hollie Smith, 19, from Cardiff, was set for a trial to get into the women's team when she was struck down by a kidney infection last year. It developed into sepsis, her heart stopped, and the young striker was left needing round-the-clock care. Hollie said more care facilities for young people were urgently needed. Sepsis test could cut diagnosis time to minutes ""When I woke up from my cardiac arrest, I had lost the use of my right side - I could no longer stand, sit up, eat, dress, look after or wash and toilet myself,"" said Hollie. ""Considering I was about to trial for the Welsh national football ladies' team before going into hospital this was all a bit of a shock."" Promising young footballer Hollie was about to have a trial for the Wales football team when she became ill Hollie was a healthy 18-year-old before sepsis struck Amid struggles with her mental health as she tried to adapt to such a brutal change, Hollie underwent months of intensive physiotherapy, which restored some of the movement she had lost. On returning home from hospital in December, she faced a new routine of two carers, four times a day, helping her with even the most basic of tasks. After six weeks, disaster struck and she developed sepsis a second time - which affected her kidneys, lungs and brain. Sepsis: Understanding why my dad died NHS help for sepsis survivors 'non-existent' Sepsis survivor in machine call for Wales Hollie was put in an induced coma for more than two weeks and was told she was ""very lucky"" to survive. But life has since consisted of a hospital bed in the living room, with bumpers to protect her from injury when having seizures, a full ceiling hoist, a team of carers, and a daily cocktail of medications. Just weeks after returning home, Hollie developed sepsis for a second time and was put in an induced coma ""I can't do the most basic of tasks, whereas I'm watching other people my age going to university and driving, and what a normal teenager or young adult should be doing,"" she said. ""It's been pretty horrendous to be honest - I think only now is it all starting to sink in. ""I do try to be positive but at the moment it's quite hard, because with Covid, everything that needs to be done is considerably slower because of the pandemic."" Incredibly - and with a fierce determination common in many sportspeople - the former footballer has been planning for the future and how she could use her experiences to help others. ""My personal goals are to go to college and resit my A-levels in order to give me a stepping stone to go on to university and study medicine. ""I also hope to start campaigning for better young disabled adults' facilities. ""Now, the long-term outlook for recovery is poor. However, I do hope in the future that I will be able to sit up with minimal assistance and be able to propel myself in a wheelchair and find a new sport to get into."" Her family said they hoped to adapt their home to give Hollie as much independence as possible and have also been trying to raise funds for private physiotherapy and a personal-use defibrillator. Hollie added she hoped to have enough for a holiday with carers provided ""so that my parents get a break too"". Hollie's trophies: She's set herself fresh life challenges - including passing her A-levels exams, and wanting to study medicine In the meantime, Hollie has highlighted that although her care has been excellent, there should be better facilities when young people experience sepsis or are learning to adapt to disability. 'Hearing loss isn't stopping me becoming a doctor' ""I've been told that I meet the threshold for residential care. However, the only places I could go would be a care for the elderly facility, or a place for people with learning difficulties, and neither would really be able to meet my needs,"" she said. ""Also in hospital there is a children's hospital but no transition for young adults - I was on a ward with dementia patients and people sometimes four times my age. ""I just want young adults to be able to have more suitable surroundings and activities to do in hospital. Also, even after being in hospital, a lot of social services and facilities care is geared towards the elderly and I just feel that needs to change."" But she was keen to stress that the hospital team at University Hospital of Wales ""were and still are amazing with me and my family and I owe my life to them"". Hollie returned from hospital to a very different life, but is focusing on the future and campaigning for better facilities for other young people Cardiff council said it was ""committed to working with individuals to find the best way of meeting their needs to ensure the best outcomes can be achieved"". ""Although every effort is made to offer different types of facilities and care services so that younger people can live independently whilst accessing the support they need, we do recognise that, due to the city's demographics, many services have a focus on older people. ""That said, care services are regularly reviewed, and in order to identify how we can best deliver high-quality services to younger people with disabilities in Cardiff, a partnership project is due to begin shortly which will help us make improvements which best meet the needs of everyone requiring care in Cardiff. ""Importantly, we will work with Cardiff and Vale University Health Board where care is shared between health and the council."" The health board said its patient experience team had contacted Hollie to share her experience ""including what aspects could have been better"". ""When patients are admitted to hospital they are triaged and are placed on a ward with access to the most appropriate clinical expertise for their needs so they get the right care and treatment at the right time,"" said a Cardiff and Vale health board official. A Welsh government said decision on appropriate care ""should be considered for patients on an individual basis in consultation with the clinician responsible for their care"". It added: ""We expect health boards to ensure there is no loss in the quality of any service provided, there is on-going engagement and good patient experience in the handover and transition of care from paediatric to adult services.""

Where will all the Afghan refugees go?,"Thousands of people are scrambling to flee Afghanistan after the Taliban seized back control of the country, almost two decades after they were ousted by a US-led coalition. The United Nations has warned that up to half a million Afghans could flee the country by the end of the year and has called on neighbouring countries to keep their borders open. The current crisis comes on top of the 2.2 million Afghan refugees already in neighbouring countries and 3.5 million people forced to flee their homes within Afghanistan's borders. The US-led operation to evacuate people by air has now ended, with the last flight taking off from Kabul airport just after midnight on Tuesday - a deadline agreed with the Taliban for foreign forces to withdraw. More than 123,000 civilians were evacuated by US forces and its coalition partners after the Taliban took control of the capital on 14 August - but it's unclear exactly how many of those were Afghan nationals. The US has said that it flew nearly 80,000 civilians out of Kabul and of those, about 5,500 were Americans and more than 73,500 were either Afghans or other foreign nationals. While the UK Ministry of Defence, which ended its evacuations on Saturday, said it had flown out more than 15,000 people and some 8,000 of them were Afghans. At the height of the operation, the US said its military planes were departing the airport every 39 minutes - although the evacuations did slow down after the suicide bomb attack on the 26 August outside the airport, which killed about 170 people, including 13 American troops. Many of those flown out of the country were taken to emergency processing centres set up in several countries, including Spain, Germany, Qatar and Uzbekistan. The Ramstein military base in Germany has become a makeshift camp for thousands of Afghans As many as 300,000 Afghans have been affiliated with US operations in the country since 2001,according,externalto the International Rescue Committee, and tens of thousands of them are eligible to obtain a US visa - but many will now have to find a different way out of the country. At the weekend, the US said it had received assurances from the Taliban that Afghan nationals who are issued with valid travel documents by another country will be allowed to leave Afghanistan. The Taliban control all the main land crossing points with Afghanistan's neighbours (shown on the map below) and reports suggest they are only allowing traders or those with valid travel documents to leave the country. However, many of those trying to flee because they fear for their safety under Taliban rule will not have any paperwork. The UN has urged Afghanistan's neighbours to keep their borders open to refugees and called on the international community to support those countries. But Uzbekistan, which borders the north of Afghanistan, has said its main crossing point is closed to ""ensure security"" and there are no plans to open it. Pakistan, which has the longest border with Afghanistan, has also said it will not accept refugees - with its US ambassador telling the BBC: ""We are already overburdened by the refugees, and it is beyond our capacity to host any more refugees."" Last week, satellite imagery of the Spin Boldak crossing point between Afghanistan and Pakistan showed a large crowd of people gathered on the Afghan side. The BBC's Shumaila Jaffery, who was at the crossing point, said it was a chaotic scene with many Afghans not being allowed to enter Pakistan. Last Friday, two Afghans were reportedly killed by Pakistani security forces at the Torkham border crossing after trying to enter Pakistan illegally. There have also been reports of thousands of Afghans trying to cross the western border with Iran, but it's unclear how many have been successful. Left behind in Afghanistan: If I can't get out, I'll die The latest movement of Afghans is part of a historical exodus from a country that has suffered instability and conflict over many years. Even before the Taliban retook control, more than 550,000 people had been forced to flee their homes this year due to fighting, according to the UNHCR. That means an estimated 3.5 million Afghans are currently internally displaced within the country. In addition to those within Afghanistan's borders, about 2.2 million refugees and asylum seekers were also seeking sanctuary in neighbouring nations as of the end of last year. This year, Afghans have also had to deal with a severe drought and food shortages across most of the country. A report by the UN World Food Programme (WFP) in June said that 14 million people - more than a third of the population - were suffering from hunger. Mary-Ellen McGroarty, WFP country director for Afghanistan, said last week that unless emergency food and medical supplies arrived soon, the ""already horrendous situation"" would become ""an absolute catastrophe, a complete humanitarian disaster"". Neighbouring countries Pakistan and Iran saw the highest numbers of Afghanistan's refugees and asylum seekers last year. Almost 1.5 million fled to Pakistan in 2020, while Iran hosted 780,000, according to UNHCR figures. Germany was third, with more than 180,000, while Turkey took nearly 130,000. When looking at asylum seeker numbers only - those who have applied for sanctuary in another country but whose claims have not yet been granted - Turkey, Germany and Greece top the list, with about 125,000, 33,000 and 20,000 respectively. Although there are no Afghan asylum seekers in Iran, those with refugee cards - an official document recognising their status - are able to access the country's health and education systems. The UN has called on its member states to help Afghan people in ""their darkest hour of need"" - but while some countries have offered refugees a safe haven, others have indicated they will not be giving sanctuary to those fleeing the crisis. BothPakistanandIranhave said that they cannot cope with a further influx of Afghan refugees. Officials in both countries have said that any refugees that do arrive will have to stay in camps near the border until they can return to Afghanistan. Uzbekistanhas said it will help transfer Afghans to third countries but will only host refugees temporarily. TheTajikistangovernment previously offered to accept up to 100,000 refugees but it's unclear if any have been allowed in yet.Turkmenistanhas said its airspace can be used for evacuation flights but it hasn't made any commitment to take in refugees itself. Turkish security forces patrolling the border with Iran help an exhausted Afghan family InTurkey, the government has urged European countries to take responsibility for any new migrant crisis, saying Turkey would not be ""Europe's migrant storage unit"". The country has stepped up construction of a border wall with Iran to thwart those entering illegally. Officials in severalEuropean Unioncountries say they are keen to avoid a repeat of the 2015 migrant crisis, when there was a populist backlash against large numbers of Syrian refugees being allowed to enter EU territory. France, which evacuated more than 2,800 people from Kabul airport, mostly Afghans, has indicated it will accept some refugees but has not specified a number.Germanyhas also not specified a number but Chancellor Angela Merkel has said as many as 40,000 people still in the country may have a right to be evacuated to Germany if they feel they are endangered. Polish soldiers have been erecting a fence along the border with Belarus to stop illegal crossings Other EU countries, likeAustria,PolandandSwitzerlandhave said they will not accept any new Afghan arrivals and are upping their border security to guard against illegal arrivals. TheUKhas said it will take in 5,000 Afghans in 2021 as part of a scheme to resettle 20,000 over the next few years, focusing on those at greatest risk from the Taliban. TheUShas not said how many refugees it will accept yet, but it has authorised $500m (Â£367m) for ""unexpected urgent refugee and migration needs of refugees"".Canadahas said that it will resettle 20,000 Afghans whileAustraliahas said it will take in 3,000. Several countries, includingKosovoandUganda, have also accepted US requests to temporarily accept Afghan refugees before they are resettled elsewhere.

However, the only places I could go would be a care for the elderly facility, or a place for people with learning difficulties, and neither would really be able to meet my needs,"" she said. ""Also in hospital there is a children's hospital but no transition for young adults - I was on a ward with dementia patients and people sometimes four times my age. ""I just want young adults to be able to have more suitable surroundings and activities to do in hospital. Also, even after being in hospital, a lot of social services and facilities care is geared towards the elderly and I just feel that needs to change."" But she was keen to stress that the hospital team at University Hospital of Wales ""were and still are amazing with me and my family and I owe my life to them"". Hollie returned from hospital to a very different life, but is focusing on the future and campaigning for better facilities for other young people Cardiff council said it was ""committed to working with individuals to find the best way of meeting their needs to ensure the best outcomes can be achieved"". ""Although every effort is made to offer different types of facilities and care services so that younger people can live independently whilst accessing the support they need, we do recognise that, due to the city's demographics, many services have a focus on older people. ""That said, care services are regularly reviewed, and in order to identify how we can best deliver high-quality services to younger people with disabilities in Cardiff, a partnership project is due to begin shortly which will help us make improvements which best meet the needs of everyone requiring care in Cardiff. ""Importantly, we will work with Cardiff and Vale University Health Board where care is shared between health and the council."" The health board said its patient experience team had contacted Hollie to share her experience ""including what aspects could have been better"". ""When patients are admitted to hospital they are triaged and are placed on a ward with access to the most appropriate clinical expertise for their needs so they get the right care and treatment at the right time,"" said a Cardiff and Vale health board official. A Welsh government said decision on appropriate care ""should be considered for patients on an individual basis in consultation with the clinician responsible for their care"". It added: ""We expect health boards to ensure there is no loss in the quality of any service provided, there is on-going engagement and good patient experience in the handover and transition of care from paediatric to adult services.""

Blair calls US withdrawal tragic and unnecessary,"This video can not be played Former PM Tony Blair: 'It's not just about the Afghan people... it's about our security' The US withdrawal from Afghanistan was wrong and based on an ""imbecilic"" slogan, former PM Tony Blair has said. He described the decision to withdraw troops from the country as ""tragic, dangerous and unnecessary"". Mr Blair, who sent troops into Afghanistan 20 years ago, said UK involvement in Afghanistan was not a ""hopeless endeavour"" despite the Taliban takeover. And the sacrifice made by British troops ""was not in vain"", he added. Mr Blair said achievements in the country over the past 20 years - including a generation growing up without Taliban rule - was a ""good cause"" that ""matters today"". Speaking to broadcasters, the former Labour leader shared concerns, not only for the Afghan people who he said stood to lose out, but also for the security of Western countries. He said the Taliban ""will give protection and succour to Al Qaeda - you've got Isis trying to operate in the country at the same time"". ""You look round the world and the only people really cheering this decision are the people hostile to Western interests,"" he added. In his online article,,externalhis first statement since Kabul fell to the Taliban last week, Mr Blair said the decision to withdraw was made ""in obedience to an imbecilic political slogan about ending 'the forever wars'"". US tells citizens to avoid Kabul airport The desperate scramble to escape Afghanistan Taliban takeover raises fears about Africa's jihadists Mr Blair said Britain had a ""moral obligation"" to stay in Afghanistan until ""all those who need to be are evacuated"". He wrote on his website: ""We must evacuate and give sanctuary to those to whom we have responsibility - those Afghans who helped us and stood by us and have a right to demand we stand by them."" This should not be done ""grudgingly but out of a deep sense of humanity and responsibility"", he added. On Sunday the Ministry of Defence said seven Afghan civilians had died in the chaotic crowds outside the city's international airport. The US has a planned deadline of 31 August for withdrawal - but President Biden has said troops may stay past this date to help with evacuations. Tony Blair with British forces in Helmand province in 2006 Mr Blair admitted mistakes had been made over Afghanistan, but ""the reaction to our mistakes has been, unfortunately, further mistakes"". He said while ""imperfect"", the ""real gains over the past 20 years"" were now likely to be lost. He said the Afghan economy was now three times larger than when the UK invaded the country alongside the US in 2001 and some 200,000 Afghans went to university this year - including 50,000 women. The withdrawal would have ""every jihadist group around the world cheering"", he said. Russia, China and Iran will take advantage, he said, adding: ""Anyone given commitments by Western leaders will understandably regard them as unstable currency."" Peter Galbraith, former UN deputy special representative for Afghanistan, said all the coalition partners bore responsibility for the chaos unfolding. ""In terms of what was imbecilic, frankly it was the strategy that was followed for 20 years, which was to try to build a highly centralised state in a country that was as diverse - geographically and ethnically - as Afghanistan, and to engage in a counterinsurgency strategy without a local partner and the local partner was corrupt, ineffective, illegitimate,"" he said. He added that coalition partners ""never seriously tried to address the corruption that was prevalent from the top"", acquiescing in ""fraudulent"" Afghan elections, and trying to fit facts into a predetermined strategy, ""rather than having a strategy that was based on the facts"". Mum fears son's Afghanistan death ""was for nothing"" 'Our lads were making a difference' UK veterans seeking mental health support President Biden hasvowed that ""any American who wants to come home, we will get you home"", but has described the evacuation as one of the ""most difficult airlifts in history"". Mr Blair's intervention comes as shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy has urged her government counterpart Dominic Raab to step up efforts to get British and eligible Afghans to the UK. She said she hadheard of people being beaten, shot at or rapedwhile trying to get documentation in Kabul. The Foreign Office said it was trying to get people out as fast as possible, with more than 3,000 people having been evacuated from the country since last Sunday. In an article in theMail on Sunday,external, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said the West's exit from Afghanistan was ""unedifying"" and would have ""consequences for us all for years to come"". He praised the British soldiers working at Kabul's airport for dealing with ""unimaginable challenges - public order, overcrowding, searing heat and desperate people"". ""Soldiers trained for war are instead holding babies and co-ordinating crowds,"" he wrote. Mr Wallace said there was ""no time to lose"" to get people out of the country but added the US would have his complete support if it chose to push back the deadline for leaving.

Ever Given cargo ship returns through Suez CanalGlobal trade was disrupted in March when the massive container ship became stuck in the waterway.Middle East,"The Ever Given, part of the Evergreen fleet, was impounded for three months after its release The huge container ship that blocked the Suez Canal in March - disrupting global trade - has passed back through the waterway without incident. The Ever Given was among a convoy of vessels sailing from the Mediterranean Sea to the Red Sea, the Suez Canal Authority (SCA) said. It had been offloading its cargo in Europe and is now en route to Asia. The ship was refloated after a major six-day salvage operation that led to the death of one person. It was then impounded for three months near the canal city of Ismailia while a compensation deal was agreed between Egypt and the Ever Given's owners. Allow Twitter content?

The SCA, in a series of tweets, said the Ever Given was escorted through the 193km (120-mile) canal by two tugboats and senior SCA guides. It was one of 26 ships that travelled from north to south through the canal on Friday, while 36 ships sailed in the opposite direction, the SCA added, hailing the waterway as the ""shortest and fastest navigational route linking the east with the west"". The Ever Given, one of the world's largest container ships, had been delivering its 18,300 containers to Rotterdam, Felixstowe and Hamburg and is now travelling to China. A satellite photograph reveals how the Ever Given was wedged across the canal The 400m-long (1,312ft) ship became wedged across the canal after running aground amid high winds on 23 March, blocking it for hundreds of ships and disrupting global trade. 'I was blamed for blocking the Suez Canal' How was the Suez Canal ship freed? Following its release, the SCA sought compensation for the Ever Given's Japanese owner Shoei Kisen for the cost of the salvage operation, damage to the canal's banks and other losses. The terms of the deal were not disclosed but Egypt had eventually settled on a $550m (Â£397m) demand. Stuck Suez ship finally on the move again.
