MP quits committee over homophobic remarks,"Labour MP Jared O'Mara has quit the Commons equality committee over online homophobic comments he made before being elected to parliament. Mr O'Mara also made misogynistic remarks, joked about having an orgy with members of Girls Aloud and posted degrading comments about fat people. The Sheffield Hallam MP, 36, was elected in June, unseating ex-deputy prime minister Nick Clegg. Mr O'Mara resigned from the Women and Equalities Committee after apologising. In posts made on the Drowned in Sound music website in 2004, Mr O'Mara claimed singer Michelle McManus only won Pop Idol ""because she was fat"" and said it would be funny if jazz star Jamie Cullum was ""sodomised with his own piano"". The posts were first reported by the Guido Fawkes website, which has since revealed that two years earlier Mr O'Mara made homophobic remarks on an internet forum. The MP has also apologised for these comments and said he was ""deeply ashamed"" of his actions. The Labour leadership described Mr O'Mara's online remarks as ""horrendous"" and ""vile"" but sources said he would not be suspended from the parliamentary party, BBC political correspondent Chris Mason reported. Mr Mason said he understood Mr O'Mara addressed his colleagues at a meeting of Labour MPs and made ""a full and very personal apology"" for his remarks. The@LGBTLabour group tweeted,externalthat it was ""deeply concerned"" by the MP's comments. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Lib Dem peer Lord Scriven, former leader of Sheffield Council, said: ""It seems like a nasty pattern of sexist language and misogyny is developing from the Labour MP for Sheffield Hallam. ""He clearly isn't fit to sit on the Women and Equalities Committee. He must stand down from that committee immediately and if he doesn't, Jeremy Corbyn must take action to remove him."" Stella Creasy,external, Labour MP for Walthamstow, added she had asked for a meeting with Mr O'Mara to discuss his comments. However Wes Streeting, Labour MP for Ilford North, who was at the meeting earlier, said: ""He offered what seemed to be a heartfelt and genuine apology and admitted that these are views he once held, which took guts. ""The battle for equality is a battle for hearts and minds and that must surely mean that people are allowed to change their views and therefore must also be offered a second chance. ""I hope I don't end up eating my words and that he demonstrates his commitment to equality as a new MP. I think we owe him that chance."" Girls Aloud were the subject of one of Mr O'Mara's online comments In a statement, Mr O'Mara said he had been ""wrong to make"" the comments. ""I understand why they are offensive and deeply apologise for my use of such unacceptable language."" ""I made the comments as a young man, at a particularly difficult time in my life, but that is no excuse."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Netflix adds another $1.6bn to war chest,"Netflix's Stranger Things has been one of the company's big hits Netflix is raising another $1.6bn (Â£1.2bn) from investors to finance new shows and possibly make acquisitions. The video streaming service plans to spend up to $8bn on content next year to compete with fast-growing rivals. Netflix will issue bonds to investors, although the interest rate it will pay has yet to be decided, the companysaid in a statement,external. Netflix plans to release 80 films next year, but some analysts are wary about its cash burn and debt interest costs. The company's latest debt fundraising is its largest so far, and the fourth time in three years it has raised more than $1bn by issuing bonds. Earlier this month,Netflix said it would raise pricesin countries including the UK and US for the first time in two years. The price rises come as Netflix faces growing competition from Amazon and other sites such as Hulu and Disney in the US. Netflix has spent heavily on original programming such as The Crown, Stranger Things and House of Cards. One movie, Mudbound, was described byVariety,externalas ""an epic about race and poverty in the 1940s Mississippi Delta"", and stars Mary J. Blige and Carey Mulligan. Some critics say it is a contender for the Academy Awards and would be the first Netflix feature to be in the Oscars race. Netflix's share price has risen more than 50% this year on the back of subscriber growth that has beat expectations. The company now has more than 109 million subscribers globally, adding 15.5 million so far this year. The move to take on more corporate debt comes amid expectations that borrowing costs may increase in coming months. The US Federal Reserve is weighing another rate hike by the end of 2017.

Lords expenses 'scandal' and Brexit leaks,"The Times reports,externalthat German Chancellor Angela Merkel is furious about the alleged leak from a dinner in Brussels, which claimed Theresa May begged for help with Brexit.

The Daily Telegraph,externalbelieves the leak amounted to a character assassination.The Sun,externalcomments that every time Theresa May extends the hand of friendship to Brussels, they pull her close, only to stab her in the back.

Russian radio presenter stabbed in neck,"Tatyana Felgengauer is seen here posing in a team photo of Ekho Moskvy presenters One of Russia's top radio presenters has had surgery after being stabbed in the neck by a man who broke into her newsroom at broadcaster Ekho Moskvy. Tatyana Felgengauer is in a medically-induced coma in a Moscow hospital but her life is not said to be in danger. A male suspect is under arrest. His motive is not clear, though police say it appears to be a personal grudge. Ekho Moskvy, an independent station, often broadcasts views critical of the Kremlin. The knifeman reportedly sprayed a gas into the face of a security guard as he broke in. Russia profile - media The full story behind Russian punch video According to Ekho Moskvy, the alleged attacker's name is Boris Grits. It describes the attacker as an Israeli, citing ""informed sources"". Russian police described him as a 48-year-old foreigner. ""Initial findings show that personal dislike was the motivation,"" police told Interfax news agency. The Moscow police havereleased a video clip,externalof the suspect under arrest, in which he claims that Felgengauer had ""sexually harassed me through telepathy"". A blog,externalapparently published by Boris Grits also contains posts vilifying Felgengauer. Blood was spattered on the floor as police tackled the intruder A Russian state TV channel recently accused Ekho Moskvy (""Moscow Echo"" in English) of working with the West to produce anti-Russian propaganda, the BBC's Sarah Rainsford reports from Moscow. Just last month, another of its journalists, Yulia Latynina, left the country after she was sprayed with faeces and her car was set on fire. This photo of the suspect was published by Ekho Moskvy after the attack Staff at the radio station say the man did not shout anything before he stabbed Tatyana Felgengauer on the building's 14th floor. She is deputy chief editor at Ekho Moskvy and has worked there for more than 10 years. She is the daughter of Pavel Felgengauer, a prominent journalist with military expertise. A photo of the suspect was published by the radio station's website editor, Vitaly Ruvinsky, on Facebook. One of the broadcaster's security guards was injured as the knifeman was being overpowered. Ekho Moskvy is a major broadcaster, respected for its independent stance Most Russians rely on TV for their news and the main channels are either directly state-controlled or run by companies with close links to the Kremlin. There have been many attacks on investigative reporters and other journalists who have challenged Russia's powerful vested interests.

'I was glad when my husband had affairs',"When Stacey wrote about her experience ofnot wanting to sleep with anyone, even her husband, dozens of readers sent emails saying that they too were asexual. Many described feeling isolated in a sexualised society. Here is a selection of their stories - and a response from an asexual activist about the importance of joining a community. I am in my sixties and have had two failed marriages, but I have never initiated or enjoyed sex with another person.  As a teenager it was easy to refuse sex, it was expected of a ""good"" girl, but family pressure meant that I was married at 21 and suddenly had no more excuses. I loved my husband and wanted to please him, but I felt no sexual desire and hated the experience of a physical relationship. I never initiated sex with him, and was almost glad when he eventually had affairs because the pressure was no longer on me to satisfy his needs. I felt overwhelming guilt for being so cold and took all the blame for my first marriage ending. I couldn't understand how I could love someone so much but dislike being touched by them... I married an older man 10 years ago who had led me to believe that he also was past sexual desire. Unfortunately this wasn't the case and he took my reluctance to have sex with him very badly. He forced me to perform sexual acts and I ended up hating him for it. We are going through an acrimonious divorce. In hindsight I should never have married again.Gill, London I am a 35-year-old man, and have only just realised I am asexual. I have always been attracted to people, form romantic feelings very quickly and have always dated. I would fancy someone, enjoy the kissing and physical contact, but when it came to sex, my body would just switch off. I thought it could have been performance issues and I kept trying - it caused huge embarrassment and destroyed my confidence for years. I am desperate for a relationship and had completely resigned myself to being alone and childless forever. But recently I have seen a lot of articles about asexuality, and I can't begin to describe the relief that I am now able to label what it is about me that is different. I can even begin to dream about finding someone who could understand.Matt I only discovered that I am asexual a few months ago when a therapist suggested it to me. Until then I had no idea what to call myself. I became sexually active when I was 17 and in college, I had a steady boyfriend and was in love with him, but I never felt sexually attracted to him. At first I thought it was due to lack of experience, but as time went on nothing changed. After we broke up I began questioning my sexuality a lot more, considering if I was a lesbian, and if that led me to feel this way. I noticed my body could become aroused, but it's like my mind isn't connected to it any more, it doesn't feel anything. Sex isn't painful for me, it doesn't repulse me, I just don't get pleasure from it. I discovered theAsexual ACES group and page on Facebook,externaland am pleased to have found people who feel the same - or similar - ways as me. But I do worry that I'll never have a romantic partner. I am open to the idea of sex to please the other person, but the fact that I do not enjoy it seems to be a huge barrier for people. I feel very much like I will be alone for my whole life.Devi, Kent Being asexual I feel irrelevant to a culture which is all about coupling: how much of daily life (fashion, recreation, entertainment) is about attracting or pleasing a partner? I'm not averse to having a partner, but feel excluded from the possibility, because who would invest time and effort into a relationship that isn't going to get them any sex? In a way, passing through the world as a sort of invisible extra is a privilege - you get more of an objective view of human relations when out of the throng yourself - but too much reflection and you start to see how you're surplus to requirements. Maybe someday I'll accept that, but I haven't got there yet.Sarah, Cambridge It's possible to feel all alone, to feel like, ""I'm too weird to get a partner,"" or ""I'm not normal."" But asexuality is just a sexual orientation, it's part of the normal spectrum of human sexuality, there's nothing pathological about it - and that goes a long way to helping people understand themselves as asexual. People who think they identify as asexual who are feeling isolated or lonely should join an asexual community - whether online or offline (see examples at the bottom of the page). Having a label really helps and finding a community definitely helps. The internet has really given asexuality its impetus as a movement. Of course, there were always asexual people around but it was very hard for them to find each other - it's not something that easily comes up in conversation and there was no obvious way for people to come together. Asexuality still isn't really an option that's talked about. People think if you're not straight you're probably gay or you might be bi. So even though there has been more awareness of asexuality in recent years it is still a relatively young movement, and there is still a long way to go. Michael DorÃ©, The Asexual Visibility and Education Network (AVEN) I've known that I wasn't like everybody else since I was 13. I tried to pretend and even went out with a few mates just to see I was just being a bit slow on the uptake. It wasn't until I was 15 that I came across the term asexual and knew then that was what I am. I would never tell my parents or family. They wouldn't understand. There is a huge generation gap of knowledge between us and none of them would have heard about it or understand it. These issues are not a new thing, they have been around for a very long time but many older people are saying that it's a new fad. They are just hearing about it for the first time because of the wonders of the internet. But the fact that you can now find a community of people online who feel like you, and who can help you come to terms with the fact that you are not a broken person, is so important.Tabitha, Bristol I am a 52-year-old guy who has been repulsed by sex for as long as I can remember. In my younger days I was always sexually active, but I never got any satisfaction from it. Other than seeing my partner receiving pleasure, I pretty much hated it. I have been in a few strong, loving relationships through my life, and even happily married once, but they all failed as a result of one thing, my total disinterest in sex.  While I was still in love, and very happy to be cuddled up in bed or on the sofa, I always found the thought of sex repulsive and this eventually ended the relationships. I've now been single for 11 years and, although I don't particularly enjoy being so, it is far easier than trying to find one of the other 1-3% of people who are the same as me. I just hope that more young people become aware of and open about their asexuality so they can find a similar person and enjoy a normal, loving, non-sexual relationship.Jon, Runcorn At 28 years old, even having known about asexuality for about five years and knowing that is what I am, I am still struggling to come to terms with it. This is partly due to the overwhelmingly negative and dismissive attitude that people have demonstrated when I have tried to tell them that I am Ace. They always tell me, ""Oh, you just haven't met the right person yet,"" or ""You're a prude then."" This has damaged my self-image, and undermined my confidence in being asexual in a modern world which revolves almost exclusively around sex. Living as part of a generation who has been constantly bombarded with sex from the media has left me feeling extremely isolated and backwards. I honestly live in fear of dying alone because I am unable to have sex. I am happy with what I am, but the world around me is not, and as such I am increasingly becoming a social hermit, because it easier than living with the disdain of an over sexualised world.Lucy, Cornwall I'm a 42-year-old man, and it's only recently I've realised what asexuality is and how well I slot into the concept. I used to keep diaries as a teenager, full of the usual angst, but it was interesting that all my feelings and thoughts towards (exclusively) girls were almost entirely romantic, bordering on platonic, rather than the horny, sex-laden fantasies that teenage boys are stereotypically supposed to have. I never really enjoyed my first sexual encounters, though they were interesting as a kind of fact-finding mission. Pretty much every encounter since, regardless of my relationship with the person in question, has been unsatisfying to the point of unfulfilling. I tend to only get even slightly aroused in positions where I'm completely passive, where I'm not in control. I've tried most positions, largely to experiment, and most of them don't work for me, I don't enjoy them and consequently nor does the person I'm with at the time. I do have a long-term partner at the moment. I call her my partner because it doesn't really feel right describing her as a ""lover"" or ""girlfriend"" as we're not, by normal standards. Although we regularly share a bed we don't even kiss never mind do more intimate stuff. I don't think she's ever quite got to grips with my lack of sexuality and tends to assume I'm gay.Ian, Nottinghamshire The Asexual Visibility and Education Network,external(AVEN) hosts the world's largest online asexual community as well as a large archive of resources on asexuality My Umbrella,externalis a volunteer-led support group for the lesser known LGBT+ identities Asexual Awareness Week,externalOctober 22-28 2017 For more information on sex and relationships visitBBC Advice All illustrations copyright Getty Images.

Killer 'terrorising' Florida neighbourhood,"This video can not be played Florida police search for suspect in connection with three murders Florida police have said they are searching for a possible serial killer believed to have fatally shot three people over the last two weeks. Officials believe the murders, which happened blocks apart, were committed by the same gunman who may have chosen the victims at random, police say. The latest victim was an autistic man who was shot while walking home from work after getting on the wrong bus. Local residents have been advised not to walk alone after dark. ""Now we have someone terrorising the neighbourhood,"" said interim Tampa Police Chief Brian Dugan, who added that there is ""no doubt"" that the crimes are linked. Anthony Naiboa, 20, was found gunned down on 19 October in the central Tampa neighbourhood of Seminole Heights. The autistic charity worker was shot to death around 20:00 local time (00:00 GMT), less than a mile away from where two others were shot and killed. Officers heard the gunshots that killed Mr Naiboa, but the suspect had fled before they arrived on scene, according to Chief Dugan. ""You can imagine the frustration of these officers to hear gunshots and not be able to find this person,"" Chief Dugan said. Benjamin Mitchell, 22, was alone at a bus stop after dark when he was shot dead on 9 October. Monica Caridad Hoffa, 32, was walking to meet a friend when she was fatally shot. She was found in a vacant lot on 13 October. Police say the killings could be connected based on the proximity of the murders and time frame, but Mr Dugan said he was cautious about using the term serial killer. The FBI are helping local police in the investigation and have released a photo of a possible suspect, but a motive is still unclear. Police say the murders are probably linked due to the proximity and time frame of the murders Local police are accompanying students to bus stops in the wake of the murders, department spokesman Steve Hegartytold the Tampa Bay Times newspaper,externalon Monday. Officers first began escorting residents during a vigil held after dark on Sunday. A crowd of more than 100 marched to the scenes of the murders and chanted: ""Whose streets? Our streets."" The US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and the Crime Stoppers of Tampa Bay have offered a $25,000 reward (Â£19,000) for information leading to the arrest of those responsible for the murders.

May hails 'important progress' in EU talks,"This video can not be played Theresa May: We are in touching distance of a deal Theresa May has said ""important progress"" on Brexit was made at last week's EU summit - but Jeremy Corbyn said it sounded like ""Groundhog Day"". The PM said she had a ""degree of confidence"" of making enough progress by December to begin trade talks. She also said there would be no ""physical infrastructure"" on the border in Northern Ireland. Meanwhile, the EU Commission president dismissed a German newspaper's account of his dinner with the PM. ""Nothing is true in all of this,"" Jean-Claude Juncker said, rejecting the article's claims Mrs May ""begged for help"" when they met and seemed tired and politically weak. Brexit deadlock talk 'exaggerated' - Tusk Business leaders unite in Brexit warning Reality Check: Why Brexit transition may not buy time After five rounds of UK-EU talks, there has been no breakthrough in the first phase of negotiations between the UK and the EU. At the summit, the other 27 EU leaders decided progress on the Brexit separation issues had not been ""sufficient"" to open talks on future trade relations with the UK yet - but they did agree to discuss future arrangements amongst themselves, paving the way for talks with the UK to possibly begin in December. Businesses arecalling for urgent agreementin setting up temporary transition arrangements after the UK's departure date in March 2019. But some pro-EU MPs expressed concern that the UK could leave without one in place, after Mrs May suggested it was dependent on details of the final ""partnership"" being clear. ""The point of the implementation period is to put in place the practical changes necessary to move to the future partnership,"" she said as she updated MPs on last week's summit. ""In order to have that, you need to know what the future partnership is going to be."" Mrs May also said the question of citizens' rights after Brexit remained her ""first priority"", with a deal within ""touching distance"", and pledged that EU nationals living in the UK would not face ""bureaucratic hurdles"" after March 2019. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: A worrying sense of Groundhog Day Her ""clear commitments"" on another sticking point, the UK's financial settlement, had helped moved talks forward, she said. In response, Mr Corbyn compared Mrs May's updates to 1993 comedy Groundhog Day, where the lead character played by Bill Murray lives the same day over and over again. ""Well, here we are again after another round of talks,"" he said, saying it was ""no clearer"" when future talks would begin or what the UK had agreed to so far. Talks have reached an ""impasse"" with no progress abroad or at home, he said, adding that the citizens' rights issue ""could have been dealt with 16 months ago"". Just before the PM got to her feet in the Commons, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker denied leaking an unsourced account of his dinner with the PM published inGerman newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine,external. This video can not be played Juncker: Theresa May was in good shape, she was not tired The account, largely written from the perspective of EU officials, suggested Mrs May appeared ""anxious, despondent and disheartened"" and had spoken of her limited room for manoeuvre back at home. ""Everyone can see: the prime minister is marked by the struggle with her own party,"" the article stated, according to a translated version quoted by a number of British newspapers. ""She has deep rings under her eyes. She looks like someone who doesn't sleep at night."" But asked by the BBC if he had spoken to the German press, Mr Juncker said: ""No, never. I am really surprised -  if not shocked - about what has been written in the German press. ""And of course repeated by the British press. Nothing is true in all of this. ""I had an excellent working dinner with Theresa May. She was in good shape, she was not tired, she was fighting, as is her duty, so everything for me was OK."" In the Commons, Tory MP Bernard Jenkin said anyone suggesting Mrs May was weak ""seriously underestimates"" the PM and the Conservative Party, urging her to ""stick to her guns"". The apparent leak of what happened at the dinner follows a similar incident in April, when Mrs May accused some in the EU of ""meddling"" in the general election campaign after details of a dinner between her and Mr Juncker in Downing Street appeared in the German press. Downing Street said it had no comment on the latest reports and pointed out that both sides were of the view that the recent get-together had been ""constructive and friendly"". Martin Selmayr is a key figure in the European Commission Earlier Nick Timothy, who was the PM's chief of staff until he quit after the general election, suggested the disclosure had all the hallmarks of coming from the European Commission. In a reference to EU official Martin Selmayr, he tweeted: ""After constructive Council meeting, Selmayr does this. Reminder that some in Brussels want no deal or a punitive one."" But Mr Selmayr said the claim was ""false"" and neither he nor Mr Juncker had any ""interest in weakening"" Mrs May. He tweeted: ""I deny that 1: we leaked this; 2: Juncker ever said this; 3: we are punitive on Brexit. It's an attempt 2 frame EU side & 2 undermine talks."" The European Commission said it was working for a fair Brexit deal and had ""no time for gossip"". ""Some people like to point at us to serve their own political priorities,"" a spokesman said. ""We would appreciate if these people would leave us alone.""

Parachute sabotage accused 'texted lover',"The army fitness instructor denies attempting to murder Victoria Cilliers in April 2015 An Army sergeant accused of tampering with his wife's parachute contacted his lover as his spouse underwent surgery after a 4,000ft fall, a court was told. Jurors were read messages sent between Emile Cilliers and Stefanie Goller in the hours after Victoria Cilliers' fall at a Wiltshire airfield in 2015. In one, Winchester Crown Court heard, the defendant asked Ms Goller to clean for him in the nude. Mr Cilliers, 37, denies attempting to murder his former Army officer wife. In another message, the Army fitness instructor told Ms Goller he would repay her services with ""hugs and kisses"", the court was told. She replied: ""Haha, I like naked cooking ; )"" The court was read WhatsApp messages the lovers exchanged after Mrs Cilliers, 40, was hurt in a jump with the Army Parachute Association at Netheravon, Wiltshire, on Easter Sunday, 2015. After telling Ms Goller that his wife was undergoing surgery, Mr Cilliers, of the Aldershot-based Royal Army Physical Training Corps, wrote: ""One day we might have a family of our own."" In a later exchange, Ms Goller told him: ""I love you in uniform ;)"", to which he replied: ""You going onto salute me?"" and Ms Goller responds ""I guess sometimes I will have to obey you ;)"" He then asked her: ""Will you call me your Mr Grey?"" During the messages sent over several months, the pair appear to plan a future together as well as a summer holiday in Honduras. The court has heard Mr Cilliers was also continuing a sexual relationship with his ex-wife Carly Cilliers and half-an-hour after making arrangements to meet her on March 29 2015, the defendant was exchanging sex messages with Ms Goller. The court heard Emile Cilliers messaged his ex-wife and his lover for sex within minutes of each other The court was read messages from Victoria Cilliers describing her ""joking"" fears that the defendant had tried to kill her by tampering with the gas fitting at their home. Prosecutors allege Mr Cilliers twisted the lines of his wife's main parachute and removed two slinks - which attach lines to the harness from a reserve chute - the day before her jump. He is also accused of a third charge of damaging a gas valve at their home a few days earlier, in the second allegation that he attempted to kill his wife. Jurors were previously told the defendant had debts of Â£22,000 andbelieved he would receive a Â£120,000 life insurance payouton his wife's death. The prosecution also claim Mr Cilliers lied to Ms Goller that he was leaving his wife because she was having an affair and he was not the father of one of their children. Mr Cilliers denies all three charges and the trial continues.

Soldier's widow: Trump made me cry,"This video can not be played How one phone call has sparked uproar The widow of a dead US soldier says Donald Trump could not remember her husband's name when he phoned to offer condolences. Myeshia Johnson, widow of Sgt La David Johnson, told ABC News the president's ""stumbling"" and tone ""made me cry"". But President Trump said that he had used Sgt Johnson's name ""without hesitation"" and described the conversation as ""very respectful"". Sgt Johnson waskilled in Nigerby Islamist militants this month. Facebook post defending Trump is fake Five reasons Trump's widow story stings How did US soldiers die in Niger? President Trump's call of condolence made headlines last week when Democratic congresswoman Frederica Wilson - who had heard it along with the family - accused him of insensitivity. This video can not be played Trump war widow row 'lowers presidency' Myeshia Johnson appeared to confirm Ms Wilson's assertion that Mr Trump had told her her husband had known what he had signed up for when joining the military. ""The president said that he knew what he signed up for, but it hurts anyways... It made me cry because I was very angry at the tone of his voice and how he said it,"" she said. ""He had my husband's report in front of him, and that's when he actually said La David. I heard him stumbling on trying to remember my husband's name."" ""If my husband is out here fighting for our country and he risks his life for our country, why can't you remember his name?"" she added. Myeshia Johnson wept on her husband's coffin at his funeral in Hollywood, Florida By Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington The Donald Trump condolence-call story is a White House headache that shows no signs of abating. It started badly for the president, as he responded to a question about US military casualties in Niger by questioning how his predecessors had dealt with the families of war dead. It got worse, as the story morphed into one of an allegedly callous presidential call to Myeshia Johnson, a grieving widow of one of the US soldiers killed in Niger. Now it's devolved into a he-said, she-said debate. Democratic Congresswoman Frederica Wilson - who knew the slain soldier - and Ms Johnson and her family claim the president mishandled the call, while Mr Trump and Chief-of-Staff John Kelly insist everything went smoothly. Needless to say, arguing with a war widow is a no-win situation, regardless of who has facts on their side. President George W Bush notably withstood harsh criticism from some bereaved families during the Iraq War without swiping back. This president is different, which should come as a surprise to no one at this point. His choices could come at a high political price, however.

He has dismissed the account of the phone call given by Ms Wilson as ""totally fabricated"". Speaking to reporters, he said: ""I did not say what she [Ms Wilson] said... I had a very nice conversation."" The White House said Mr Trump's conversations with the families of dead servicemen were private. Sgt Johnson was one of four US special forces soldiers who died in an ambush in Niger. Mr Trump was criticised for not contacting the families of the dead servicemen right after they were killed, or publicly commenting on their deaths until 12 days later when asked by a reporter. He responded to this criticism byfalsely claimingthat his predecessor, Barack Obama, and other former US presidents had not called the relatives of dead service members. This video can not be played Trump denigrates Obama over false fallen soldier claim The row escalated when Mr Trump pointed out that his chief of staff, General John Kelly, after his son was killed in Afghanistan, did not receive a call from President Obama. The White House later said Mr Trump had spoken to the families of those killed in Niger but did not say when. On 4 October, it was reported that three US soldiers on a reconnaissance patrol had been killed and two others wounded in an ambush near the West African nation's border with Mali. Two days later, the body of Sgt Johnson was found by Nigerien forces, said the US military, making him the fourth American to die in the attack. General Joseph Dunford, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said on Monday the Niger attackers had launched the ambush using small arms, rockets and machine guns. He said the initial investigation points to local tribal fighters associated with the so-called Islamic State being the culprits. Some reports suggest up to 50 militants may have ambushed the group. After an hour of battle, the team requested support, Gen Dunford said. It is unclear why it took them so long to call for back-up. Within another hour, French Mirage jets arrived. Later in the afternoon, French attack helicopters and a Nigerian quick reaction force turned up. There are 800 US troops in Niger, more than in any other African nation, said Gen Dunford. They are training local forces to take on Islamist militants, he added. But the level of the deployment seemed to be news to some US congressmen. At leastthree senators,externalsaid on Monday they did not know so many American soldiers were in Niger. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, who sits on the armed services committee, admitted he had ""little insight on why they [the US troops] were there and what they were doing"". Allow Twitter content?

'Our baby dream feels further away',"Sophie Sulehria and her husband Jonny knew they wanted children from the first time they spoke about it Every year, about 50,000 women walk into an IVF clinic in the UK, hoping it will help them achieve their dream of parenthood. But despite almost 40 years of research, the treatment fails 70% of the time. The BBC's Sophie Sulehria shares her struggle of trying for a baby. I didn't think it could happen to us. We had been married for six months and had no reason to think we couldn't have children. All our friends had become pregnant so easily, it should have been the next step. But four years of IVF treatment and Â£38,000 later, our baby dream feels further away. Listen to Sophie's story here on BBC Radio 4's PM programme Jonny and I met in 2009 and two years later, we were married.  We bought our first house together which we were going to renovate ourselves, excited to earmark the spare room as the nursery. We'd always wanted children, from the moment we met we talked about it.  I didn't have a thought in my head it would be hard for us. But of course, it was. The couple, both 35, were excited to earmark a nursery in their home in Buckinghamshire By the end of 2013 I was pulling my hair out.  Although people warned me it could take time, I knew something was seriously wrong. I had always had acute tummy pain but was repeatedly told by doctors it was ""probably IBS"".  But when I didn't fall pregnant, I started to join up the dots. A laparoscopy confirmed it was far worse than we had feared - I hadstage four endometriosis,external, a condition where tissue that behaves like the lining of the womb is found in other parts of the body. It was suffocating my reproductive organs and had started to grow on my diaphragm, kidneys and liver. It was that day we were told it would probably be impossible to have children naturally.  I remember Jonny collapsing into a chair, unable to take in the news. Ms Sulehria started IVF after tests revealed endometriosis and premature ovarian failure After the first unsuccessful attempt, three years of ""hell"" ensued Blood tests also revealed I was suffering from premature ovarian failure.  I was in my early 30s and had the egg count of a 50-year-old. We needed to move quickly if we wanted to try IVF with my own eggs, so we started treatment on the NHS in April 2014. Even after a huge amount of medication, they were only able to collect one egg, though it was ""top quality"". As I waited the two weeks until I was able to do the pregnancy test, I was certain it had worked. 'I had IVF for a couple I'll never meet' My endometriosis story 'I wish IVF had never been invented' Sadly I was wrong and we were forced to face doing the whole thing again.  But this time we would have to pay privately. Time was of the essence as with every month that passed by, my egg reserve got lower and lower. Three more years of hell ensued - six rounds of unsuccessful IVF, at a total cost of Â£38,000. According to the statistics, IVF fails 70% of the time We had to borrow money from family and with each failed round, the news has got worse and worse. How could this be happening to us? I hit complete depression. My body didn't feel like my own and my phobia for needles was getting worse, yet every day I had to face up to five of them. But the hardest part of it all was my mind, I was all-consumed with being a mum. People would only have to mention their baby news and I would have a meltdown. Everywhere I turned, people would be pregnant. The worst year was 2016. Some days I couldn't get out of bed, just staring into space thinking how far away the dream of being a mum felt. But it was Jonny I felt for more.  Not only did he have to face the fact he may not be a dad any time soon, but he also had to live with me. This wasn't the woman he married - a low, depressive person who couldn't have his children. When I first heard the words ""you won't be able to have children naturally"", it hit me like a wrecking ball. Since that day my positivity and determination to build a family with the woman I love so dearly has rarely wavered, but when it does, it feels like overwhelming waves of raw emotion with no end in sight. People have said what a great support I have been to Sophie and what a rock I am. The reality is, my weaknesses are often hidden, covered by a brave face. I always wish I could do more, I wish I could fix this, make everything OK. The reality of how I've coped with the journey is simple - Sophie. She is the only reason I have been able to, and still can, get up every morning. I will continue to do everything I can for her and our future family, however that comes. Sophie and I used to talk about our life together, building a family, home and future filled with love and joy. I know this can all still happen, just in a different way than we envisaged, and more than ever we are determined to make that happen. I had no idea about the 70% IVF failure rate until we became one of the statistics. We are now nearing the end of our fourth year of our fertility journey and I can't remember what life was like before we started trying for children. But if we want a family, we may need to start looking at other ways to do so. So what do people do when ""baby plan A"" starts to move further and further away? What other options are out there for us to become parents? What does ""plan B"" look like? We have no idea. Do we look at adoption? Fostering? Using donor eggs? The statistics offer a more meaningful picture of success rates, researchers say An egg is removed from the woman's ovaries and fertilised with sperm in a laboratory The fertilised egg is then returned to the woman's womb to develop IVF worked for the first time on 10 November 1977. On 25 July 1978, the world's first IVF baby, Louise Brown was born On average, IVF fails 70% of the time The highest success rates are for women under 35, one-third of treatment cycles are successful On average, it takes almost four-and-a-half years to conceive with IVF Source: Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority/Fertility Network UK We don't have a solution, we don't have a baby, and we don't know what to do next.

What's it like to wake up the day after you planned to die?,"Colin Campbell was scheduled to die on Thursday 15 June 2017. He was due to travel to an assisted death clinic in Switzerland and end his life after 56 years. But an encounter with a stranger led him to postpone his appointment and give life another go. ""I was quite surprised to wake up on the Friday,"" he says. ""The Thursday morning was unusual as I had publicly declared it would be the day of my death and I'd been so prepared I'd be gone, but I'm still here."" Colin, from Inverness, had reached his decision having been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS) in 1995 after he started to find it more difficult to take part in sport. The condition attacks the nervous system, and although it's not terminal it is progressive. Colin's mobility started to decline and as the MS progressed over the following months he had no choice but to leave his job as an IT consultant. He became more vulnerable to illnesses and, as a single man in a second-floor flat with no lift, he felt like a ""prisoner"" in his own home, unable to get in and out easily. Over time, he slowly lost contact with friends. ""I decided I couldn't cope with another winter after I was hospitalised twice within three months,"" he says. By April 2017, he decided the best solution was to apply to a Swiss service which facilitates assisted voluntary suicide, and was quickly approved for the procedure. Assisted suicide is unlawful in Scotland. A move to change the law was defeated in a vote in the Scottish Parliament in 2015. While he waited out the final few months, Colin took part in a television programme for STV about legalising assisted voluntary suicide. Rona Tynan happened to have the TV on that night and stepped into his story. ""I heard the words 'multiple sclerosis' and 'Inverness',"" she says. ""So I dashed to the telly in my wheelchair and listened to Colin's story. I felt desperate that he was feeling he had to take this action."" Rona was from the same city and also has MS. It has impaired the movement in her left side and started to weaken her right side too. A wife and mother, she says she has an active and happy life, although a year ago she had felt similarly hopeless. When her cousin realised Rona wasn't getting the help she was entitled to, social services were quickly contacted and more support was established. ""My big concern was whether Colin had in place all the correct back-up to give him a better quality of life and I really wanted to try and see if I could help him,"" she says. ""I didn't want him to think that I was disrespecting his decision, but I didn't want to think that a man had gone to his death because he hadn't got proper help."" Colin and Rona join the BBC Ouch team in the studio for an emotional conversation about how a person comes to contemplate assisted death, the available support and controversial stem cell treatment. Also on the programme is journalist and anti-assisted suicide campaigner Mik Scarlet, comedian and mental health campaigner Juliette Burton and comedian Tom Skelton. Listen to the To Switzerland - Or Not podcasthere. Rona's concerns were well-founded. When they met, with just a few weeks to go before the deadline, she discovered Colin was poorly informed of the assistance available to him, including how something as simple as a mobility scooter might help. ""I'm a girl that likes to get about town and a scooter basically gave me my life back. I wanted Colin to try this so he's not stuck and isolated,"" she says. ""Sometimes you think you haven't got a lot going for you, but I feel fresh air, people and friends would make a big difference in Colin's life."" How MS ended an England footballer's career Assisted dying: What do disabled people think? Caroline Wyatt: MS 'brain fog' lifted after stem cell treatment Rona secured a scooter trial for Colin which he found helpful, but despite her knowledge of the system, she says she has found it difficult to get all the necessary support even for herself. ""I have spent thousands on things like stair lifts and private care but still haven't got a ramp. If these things were given to us, or proper help given earlier, I think life would be a lot easier."" NHS Highland says it provides every MS patient with a specialist nurse to inform them about the support available and in Colin's case continues to work with him ""to provide support and advice"". Rona is surprised that, given Colin had gone public on his decision to end his life, no service had intervened or suggested he give other services a go. ""I just think it's very sad that this man went out to Switzerland not knowing the simple things,"" she says. Colin is more sanguine. He says when he visited the clinic in Basel, Switzerland, he had to pass six tests to ensure he was not vulnerable or being coerced. ""If I'd failed any of those stages they would have denied to provide the prescription that enabled assisted voluntary suicide,"" he says. ""You don't just think 'I'm going to kill myself'. If you decide to go to Switzerland, there's a lot of planning and it was a well-thought out decision."" However, he admits the clinic did not ensure he had exhausted every avenue of support available. Journalist Mik Scarlet, a member of Not Dead Yet UK, a group of disabled people who oppose assisted suicide, says implementing a safeguarding level would be essential if it was legalised in the UK. Paralysed at the age of 15, Mik tried to take his own life two years later. Mik Scarlet at an Ouch storytelling event ""I understand that fear and that black future,"" he says. ""A lot of it is lack of support, lack of knowledge, and Colin's story encapsulates why we're worried. ""You can't say you've made an informed decision if you don't know about scooters or care plans."" On Colin's initiative, he and Rona started to explore treatment options and Rona has travelled to Mexico to take part in stem cell research. The risky therapy involves wiping out the person's immune system with strong cancer drugs and then rebooting it with a stem cell transplant to stunt the progress of MS. In arecent study, out of the 281 people who had the treatment, nearly half benefited, but eight died shortly afterwards. Recovery can take as long as two years and it came with a Â£50,000 price tag which Rona had to crowdfund. While Rona recovers in Mexico from the treatment, Colin has settled into a new life and new ground-floor flat in Greenock, nearly 200 miles (322km) from Inverness. Despite the long-distance relocation, he says: ""It's great. I get all my meals and essentials done for me"". But his mind continues to return to winter and whether he wants to endure it again. ""It's not pleasant. With MS you're at high risk of a chest infection. You develop a cough which then becomes pneumonia and its the pneumonia that kills you. ""I was fully expecting that Thursday would be my final morning on planet earth. This is bonus time, but I'm realistic about it, my plans aren't cancelled.""

Which countries have fleeing IS fighters gone to?,"Driven out of their de facto capital of Raqqa after three brutal years, IS fighters have lost much of the territory they once held. How real is the danger they will now travel to other countries to carry out attacks, asks Dr Lorenzo Vidino. As the self-declared Islamic State steadily crumbles in Iraq and Syria, security officials throughout the world are asking themselves a crucial question: what will happen to its fighters? Roughly30,000 foreign fighters joined IS,externaland there is concern that these battle-hardened individuals will return home, or move elsewhere, carrying out terrorist attacks to avenge the demise of the ""caliphate"". While difficult to forecast, the changing fortunes of IS will undoubtedly have major implications for global security. There are indications, including anassessment by US counter-terrorism officials,external, that some foreign fighters will stay in Syria and Iraq. The head of the UK security service MI5 said this week that fewer than expected of the 800 Britons who joined IShad returned recentlyand that at least 130 had been killed. Those foreign fighters who do remain are likely to continue with IS as the group morphs into what it was in its early days, some 10 years ago: a lethal insurgent force using tactics ranging from terrorist attacks to guerrilla warfare. Foreign fighters have been over-represented among militants making last, desperate stands in thebattles of MosulandRaqqa. And many of them are now being tried in Iraqi courts, creating legal and moral dilemmas for many of their countries of origin, assome may face the death penalty.,external However, many other fighters have been leaving the ""caliphate"", mostly through the 822km (510 mile) long border between Turkey and Syria. While Turkish authorities have been patrolling with significantly more zeal than in the past, mountainous terrain and the presence of sophisticated smuggling networks mean the border is quite permeable. IS has a long-established support network throughout Turkey, which is playing a key role in extracting foreign fighters from Syria. Given the scores of attacks that have bloodied the country over the last three years, Turkish authorities are understandably concerned about this influx. Neighbouring countries, such as Jordan and Lebanon, have similar fears. The potential end destinations for foreign fighters leaving Syria and Iraq are plentiful. There is evidence that some have joined the official wilayat, or ""provinces"", IS has established inYemen, theSinai Peninsula,external, theNorth Caucasus,externalandEast Asia.,external The group also has a strong presence in Libya, where the US suggested last year that it hadup to 6,500 fighters,external, and several hundred in Afghanistan, where the US reportedkilling at least 94 fighters,externalin an attack on underground tunnels. Marawi in the Philippines has been partly held by fighters linked to IS since May There are also anecdotal indications of militants travelling to conflicts in far flung places such as theDemocratic Republic of Congo,external,Myanmar,externaland thePhilippines,external. The arrival of foreign fighters to these regions could strengthen the capabilities of local jihadist groups and change the course of sometimes devastating conflicts. Many other foreign fighters are choosing to return to their countries of origin. While some returnees may no longer engage in militant activities, others areestablishing clandestine networks,externalseeking to carry out attacks and, according to local circumstances, destabilise the country's political situation. North African countries are particularly vulnerable to the risk - nowhere more so than Tunisia, asabout 6,000 of its citizens left,externalto join IS - the highest per capita rate in the world. Arab Gulf countries may also suffer from this type of blowback. Russia, the Caucasus, and a number of Central Asian countries are also areas of concern, having seen large numbers join IS - many of whom went on to play a prominent role on the battlefield. European authorities consider the return of some of the estimated6,000 European foreign fighters,externala major security concern. To date, fewer than one in five individuals involved in attacks on the West since the ""caliphate"" was declared in 2014 had experience as foreign fighters, according to research by the Italian Institute for International Political Studies (ISPI) and the George Washington University's Program on Extremism. The Paris attacks were carried out in part by former foreign fighters Who was behind the jihadist attacks on the West? Who are Britain's jihadists? The archaeological treasures IS failed to destroy But this might change as the number of returnees - now estimated at roughly 1,000 -  increases. Many may show no sign of wishing to engage in further violent activities, but there is a valid concern that some may make use of their combat skills. It is plausible that they could use their network of contacts and ""celebrity status"" among unaffiliated jihad enthusiasts to plan terrorist attacks. The territorial losses suffered by IS are not likely to affect the operational ability of these largely independent militants. While significant problems still exist, European authorities have improved intelligence sharing to better detect returning fighters. And thanks to improved co-operation with Turkey, many militants have been arrested before they get any further. A few do manage to reach Europe illegally, or by posing as refugees - as some of theNovember 2015 Paris attackersdid. But most foreign fighters will come to Europe legally, often using their genuine European passports. If detecting them is a problem, working out what to do with them is equally fraught. Arresting them may be the obvious answer, but the reality is significantly more complicated. The UK Home Office, for example, disclosed last year that of the 400 British foreign fighters who had returned from Syria and Iraq,only 54 were convicted,external. Similar dynamics can be observed throughout the continent. Inside Raqqa after IS pushed out The city fit for no one Raqqa's loss seals rapid rise and fall What is preventing authorities from arresting, prosecuting and convicting returning foreign fighters? It is mostly a legal matter, with lawmakers struggling to keep up with a constantly shifting threat environment. While legislations vary from country to country, they share some common problems. In some countries, joining a terrorist organisation or fighting in a foreign conflict were not criminal offences at the time when most individuals travelled to Syria. Several countries have since introduced new laws which, however, cannot be applied retrospectively. Even in countries where such actions have long constituted criminal offences, authorities struggle to gather the evidence needed to build a strong criminal case. Knowing that somebody joined IS or committed atrocities in Syria from an intelligence perspective is one thing. Being able to prove that beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law is another. Even more complicated is the issue of children either born or raised in the ""caliphate"" by their foreign fighter parents. While most are not punishable under the law, they deserve attention because of the trauma they have suffered and, in some cases, because they present severe signs of radicalism despite their young age. The result is that authorities are overwhelmed, having to monitor hundreds of battle-hardened fighters, on top of the burgeoning number of home-grown IS sympathisers, in an attempt to determine which pose an immediate security threat. Instead, authorities throughout Europe have increasingly invested in programmes seeking to deradicalise returning foreign fighters. While it might be premature to definitively assess them, there are indications that some, like the one established in the Danish city of Aarhus -offering rehabilitation and inclusion in society,external, are effective. Others, like the French plan to set up 12deradicalisation centres,external, have been shelved. The loss of much of its territory is a major blow to ISIS. Yet the group and its adherents are already surfacing in various parts of the world and are likely to do so with even more frequency and vehemence in the near future. IS will become a more decentralised, amorphous organisation operating in a more asymmetric fashion, but it will not disappear. Moreover, the IS brand and the emotional appeal of its ""caliphate"" are unlikely to vanish any time soon. And, despite critical challenges, the organisation's remarkably strong digital presence, the so-called ""virtual caliphate"", will survive in some form, potentially rekindling the commitment of sympathisers worldwide and prompting some to carry out terrorist attacks in its name. The fall of the ""caliphate"" closes a chapter, but a new one is about to be opened.

Charting China's 'great purge' under Xi,"Not since the days of Mao Zedong (right) has a campaign on the scale of Mr Xi's been seen Since becoming China's leader in 2012, Xi Jinping has overseen a vast and ruthless anti-corruption drive in which more than a million officials have been disciplined. A BBC study has found that more than 170 ministers and deputy minister-level officials have been sacked and many jailed under Mr Xi, accused of charges such as corruption, misconduct and violation of party discipline. It has been described by some as a massive internal purge of opponents, on a scale not seen since the days of Mao Zedong, in whose Cultural Revolution many top officials were purged. The most noticeable departure from tradition has been the breaking with many unwritten party conventions since Mao's time. The prosecution of so many national-level officials has been notable - in recent decades prominent figures would usually have been quietly retired. But in the last five years, 35 members (full and alternate) of the Chinese Communist Party's powerful Central Committee have been disciplined. That is as many as in all the years between 1949 and 2012. Based on official data, a staggering 1.34 million officials at high and low levels - the so-called ""tigers and flies"" - have been brought down by corruption and disciplinary charges during President Xi's first five years in office. No walk of life has been spared - those felled range from village chiefs and factory managers to government ministers and generals. The so-called ""great purge"" goes right to the very top of government - the biggest scalp so far was once the third most senior leader in China, Zhou Yongkang. He had been in charge of the vast internal security apparatus until he retired. Sun Zhengcai, who was sacked as Chongqing party secretary,was only the fourth sitting politburo member ever to be expelled from the Communist Party. Promoted before Xi Jinping took office, Mr Sun, 54, was the politburo's youngest member and had been tipped for the very top. Zhou Yongkangis the most senior official felled so far. Until he retired in 2012 he was the third most powerful politician in China. In 2015 he was jailed for life for bribery, abuse of power and disclosing state secrets. Abruptly removed from his post in July,Sun Zhengcaiis the most senior serving official to be caught by President Xi's purge. Only the fourth sitting politburo member to ever be expelled from the Party. Xu Caihouwas among highest-ranking military until he retired in 2013. He was investigated as part of a ""cash for ranks"" probe and ultimately expelled from the party and prosecuted. He died of cancer in 2015. Guo Boxiongserved alongside Xu. In July 2016 he became the highest-ranking military official prosecuted since the end of the revolution in 1949. He was sentenced to life in prison for bribery. Ling Jihuawas a trusted adviser of Hu Jintao but was swiftly demoted under Xi. After a scandal that began when his son died ""in a state of undress"" in a Ferrari crash, he was jailed for life for bribery in 2016. Nearly 70% of the party's ruling Central Committee members will be replaced with new faces at the current congress although in the majority of cases alleged corruption or other transgressions will not be the reason - age will be. An unwritten party rule currently sets the retirement age at 65 for Central Committee members. The Thoughts of Chairman Xi How China's Communist Party picks leaders The rising stars of China's Communist Party No area has been more radically restructured under President Xi than the military, which he swiftly set about comprehensively reorganising and modernising. More than 60 generals have been investigated and sacked in the drive to introduce a Western-style joint command and promote young officers to top positions. Even as the delegates started to gather in Beijing for the current party congress, the pace of the campaign showed no signs of slowing down. Twotop generals, Fang Fenghui and Zhang Yang, disappeared,externalfrom public view as recently as last month, and a series of new high-level investigations have been announced. The BBC's profile of Xi Jinping Military facelift a sign of bigger changes Profile: China's fallen security chief Zhou Yongkang Chinese officials 'plotted against Xi' The five-yearly congress in Beijing is expected to see the president remain as party chief and bring in a new leadership team, helping to entrench his already considerable power. If things go to plan for President Xi, he should be able to get many of his loyalists into key positions. Since he took office a number of his allies have been promoted. Here are some of the biggest gainers. Li Zhanshuwas party chief in a county neighbouring Mr Xi's early in their careers. In 2015 he visited Moscow as Mr Xi's ""special representative"". Has played a leading role in maintaining strong relations with Russia. Chen Min'eris one of the ""New Zhijiang Army"", the group of now senior CPC figures who worked under Mr Xi when he was party secretary in Zhejiang. Chen replaced the disgraced Sun Zhengcai in Chongqing. Another of the so-called ""New Zhijiang Army"" isCai Qi. Before being summoned to the capital his popular blog had more than 10m social media followers. Said to be President Xi's top foreign policy aide,Wang Huninghas been labelled ""China's Kissinger"" by a leading South Korean newspaper. He also advised former presidents Hu and Jiang. President Xi described his key economic adviserLiu Heas ""very important to me"" when introducing him to President Obama's National Security Adviser in 2013. Mr Liu has an MA in public administration from Harvard. Who ends up in the party's Politburo Standing Committee, China's top decision-making body which currently has seven seats, will show exactly how powerful he has become. Its members - and those of the 25-seat Politburo - will be revealed on 25 October once the congress ends. But analysts say Mr Xi, along with anti-corruption chief Wang Qishan, a key ally, has used the clean-up campaign to help shape who China's new leaders will be. The country's Communist Party has for decades ruled by consensus, but analysts say President Xi is rewriting party rules and concentrating power in his own hands. Critics accuse him of encouraginga cult of personality. They point to the fact that most of the top officials who have been disciplined have been supporters of his opponents, or former presidents Jiang Zemin or Hu Jintao. President Xi's supporters say the anti-corruption drive is needed to restore the ruling party's credibility as the president pursues his dream of a more prosperous and powerful China which will soon overtake the US as the world's largest economy.

The Houses of Parliament - a building catastrophe?,"This autumn, MPs are due to debate whether they will have to leave the Houses of Parliament while it undergoes essential repairs. But could they be forced out of their iconic building by a potentially messy blockage? Turn on a gas alarm as a precaution, open a substantial iron gate and head down into a basement. The hum of machinery grows louder - and the smell grows stronger. Impressive but distinctly old-fashioned cylinders and pumps appear. An engineer accompanying me explains that these are ""sewage ejectors"", dating from 1888. An enterprising Victorian technology museum, you might be assuming, with working exhibits? But this is in fact the basement of the Palace of Westminster. And these Victorian antiques are all that stand between Parliament and an almighty stink. The engineer is Andrew Piper, design director for Parliament's Restoration and Renewal programme, which is planning a project lasting several years and will cost billions of pounds. The original steam engine, once used to power the sewage ejectors, is still in working order He explains that ""everything from the toilets, the rainwater outlets - it all comes down to this point"" - before being ejected out to the main London drain. The ejectors were installed to stop London's sewage invading the buildings after heavy rainfall. And there they still are, working away, almost 130 years later. But, adds Mr Piper ""we can't rely on these sorts of systems for much longer"". So what happens if they suddenly fail? ""If you can't use the toilets any more a building quickly becomes unusable. The end result would be potentially shutting the building down."" The sewage system is just one of several growing hazards. Mr Piper and his basement maintenance team struggle with constant fire dangers. There are modern electrical cables crammed next to older asbestos-covered steam pipes. And a system of vents that could carry smoke or flames swiftly through the building. Flooding in the basement of the Palace of Westminster in June 2017 The building that's meant to represent the British constitution is a kind of national monument to make do and mend, with lots of bits from different eras bolted on to each other and much left unwritten - like where all these cables and vents end up, and what they actually do. The Palace of Westminster, one of the best known buildings in the world, is in a truly terrible state. Some have known this for years. A joint committee, including MPs and peers, published a report last year which warned that the palace ""faces an impending crisis which we cannot responsibly ignore"". ""There is a substantial and growing risk of either a single, catastrophic event, such as a major fire, or a succession of incremental failures in essential systems."" So how has this happened? And what does the state of Parliament say about the state of our politics? Firstly, there's the belief that the building represents political stability. Maintenance has long been limited by MPs' insistence that nothing must stop them from sitting there. So any repairs have been crammed into recess times. And there's another layer to this psychological attachment, says Dr Caroline Shenton, historian and former parliamentary archivist. The palace, with its bars and restaurants, gym and post offices, becomes a kind of home from home for MPs and peers, giving a ""daily sense of continuity and security"". Add to that anxiety - in this increasingly angry, anti-politics era - about what public opinion and headline writers will say as the multi-billion cost of renewal emerges. Sheffield University's Prof Matthew Flinders, chair of the Political Studies Association of the United Kingdom, who has closely followed the Restoration and Renewal programme, says this failure to take a decision is a classic example of what political scientists call ""elite blockage"". The palace, he says, ""casts a spell"" on many who use it. It represents a kind of politics with ""low expectations of public engagement"" which ""locks in by its design not only a two-party system but also a very masculine, adversarial kind of politics"". Those who benefit leave it to others to take tough unpopular decisions in the future. Meanwhile ""the building can't take it any more - we've reached a crunch point."" The Palace of Westminster's cast iron roofs are 160 years old He would like the current problems to be seen as an opportunity - to open up the building and change the way we do politics. Public access could be greatly improved, especially for disabled people who currently struggle to enter. Others say a renovated palace would prove a huge asset as Brexit Britain tries to reinforce its international reputation. MPs are due to debate the latest restoration and renewal plan at some point this autumn. But those who have watched years of delay and disagreement don't expect swift action. So will it take a catastrophe - like the 1834 fire which destroyed the palace's predecessor - to force a change? ""It's starting to look like that,"" says Dr Shenton. It might be that ""the whole place just grinds to a halt"". ""In terms of British pride,"" warns Prof Flinders, ""if we wait for a catastrophe to close down Parliament, it's going to be an absolute disaster."" And as for the failure of those sewage ejectors - that would create an ""elite blockage"" like no other.

How did US soldiers die in Niger?,"A funeral for La David Johnson was held at the weekend in Hollywood, Florida The latest controversy involving Donald Trump centres on the way he extended his condolences to the widow of a soldier killed in Niger. Myeshia Johnson accused the US president of struggling to remember her husband's name. Mr Trump denies this. Sgt La David Johnson was one of four US soldiers killed in Niger earlier this month. Here is what we know about their deaths. A joint patrol between US and Niger troops came under machine-gun and rocket fire on 4 October near Tongo Tongo in the Tillaberi region of south-western Niger. According to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen Joseph Dunford, the soldiers did not seek additional help until an hour after the attack began. Minutes later a drone arrived. French aircraft came to provide assistance within an hour, followed by attack helicopters, with the Nigeriens also providing backup. Five soldiers from Niger and three from the US Army Special Forces were reported killed, while two other Americans were wounded. The French airlifted the injured to the capital city Niamey, before they were eventually flown to Germany for treatment and later home to the US. The bodies of those killed were taken away by a private contractor. Soldier's widow: Trump made me cry Trump denies claims over soldier's widow While on the ground on such assignments, US personnel are usually equipped to fight back if attacked but they are not in Niger primarily to carry out offensive missions. It is highly unlikely that these troops were on a high-risk mission - otherwise they would have had a stronger deployment. Gen Dunford says the troops did not expect resistance on this patrol, as is the basis for joint patrols with local military forces. As a result they were only equipped with rifles and other small arms. During the fighting, he was separated from his colleagues. French, Nigerien and US forces remained in the area until Sgt Johnson's body was found two days later. So far, no group has claimed it. The area is near the border with Mali. Different extremist groups - including some linked to al-Qaeda, as well as the so-called Islamic State - operate on both sides of the border. Many of the attacks carried out here are not claimed by any group. Some local and regional media say the regional wing of IS, led by Abu Walid al-Sahrawi, is responsible. But unusually, there has been no chatter about it on IS-linked social media accounts. Jihadist groups often boast when they kill soldiers, so to have Westerners, and Americans in particular as their victims, would be considered a huge feat. US officials says troops in Niger are not taking part in direct combat missions Videos from jihadi groups sometimes feature videos of captured soldiers or corpses of those killed. There has been no such acknowledgement so far and it does not appear as if the attackers found Sgt Johnson's body. The attack happened a long way away from areas where Boko Haram militants are usually found, which is towards the south-east of Niger around Lake Chad. The US has 800 military personnel in Niger to support and train the local forces to improve counterterrorism efforts (and the US supports several other African countries in a similar manner). Last Thursday, Director of Joint Staff Lt-Gen Kenneth McKenzie insisted US troops were not taking part in or advising in Niger's direct combat missions. Some of the Americans are also involved in the construction of an air facility in the town of Agadez for transport and surveillance operations across the Sahel region. The plan is to share the intelligence gathered with the local partners, including Niger. That is what some American politicians and media are suggesting but back in June, in a letter to Congress, President Trump, indicated that there were 625 US troops in Niger at the time, conducting counterterrorism operations. Currently at 800, this tally is the largest in Africa outside Camp Lemonnier, the US base in Djibouti. This is the first time American soldiers have been killed in combat in Niger. With the increasing number of US military personnel getting involved in missions in Africa, it would not be far-fetched to suggest there will be other cases in the future. In May, a navy seal was killed in Somalia while accompanying local forces on a raid on al-Shabab militants. It is still unclear what the circumstances surrounding the attack were. US Africa Command (Africom) says it is investigating the case to establish the details of what led to the incident, what happened during the fighting and the aftermath, including how Sgt Johnson got separated from his colleagues, whether the forces conducting the evacuation conducted a headcount, and why it took so long to find Sgt Johnson's body. While the Americans insist the convoy was not on a special mission, including pursuing any high-value targets, some media reports quote Nigerien military officials as saying the troops had been responding to an attack on a nearby village by an armed group. These reports raise questions about whether the locals had been sympathetic to or even collaborating with the attackers, to allow the soldiers to be lured into the ambush. It is also unclear whether the US forces had enough intelligence on the threat they faced.

Weinstein Co faces civil rights inquiry,"Harvey Weinstein insists any sexual relations he had were consensual New York prosecutors are investigating the company co-founded by Harvey Weinstein following allegations of sexual assault made against the film producer. The civil rights inquiry seeks to identify employees who have been subject to harassment. ""If sexual harassment or discrimination is pervasive...we want to know,"" the attorney general's office said. Company documents will be seized as part of the investigation. The Weinstein Company, which is based in New York, has come under intense pressure over the scandal and fired Mr Weinstein from its board earlier this month. More than two dozen women - among them actresses Angelina Jolie, Gwyneth Paltrow and Rose McGowan - have made a number of accusations against Mr Weinstein. In a statement, New York attorney general Eric Schneiderman said: ""No New Yorker should be forced to walk into a workplace ruled by sexual intimidation, harassment, or fear."" ""If sexual harassment or discrimination is pervasive at a company, we want to know."" A source familiar with the investigation told the BBC that prosecutors would subpoena documents as part of the inquiry. These include documents relating to complaints about sexual harassment and how such complaints were handled. Harvey Weinstein: Who has accused him of what? Women in Weinstein's own words How the scandal unfolded Nyong'o accuses Weinstein of harassment Harvey Weinstein, whose films have received more than 300 Oscar nominations, has ""unequivocally denied"" any allegations of non-consensual sex. This video can not be played On some red carpets, Harvey Weinstein is not a welcome subject Elsewhere, Los Angeles police announced its first investigation involving Mr Weinstein in California. ""The Los Angeles Police Department's Robbery Homicide Division has interviewed a potential sexual assault victim involving Harvey Weinstein which allegedly occurred in 2013,"" LAPD spokesman Sal Ramirez told the BBC. In London, police say Mr Weinstein is accused of assaulting three women in separate incidents in the late 1980s, 1992, 2010, 2011 and 2015. Officers are looking into claims they were attacked in Westminster, Camden and west London. No arrests have been made over any of the allegations, police say. Meanwhile, the actor Matt Damon said he became aware of Harvey Weinstein's alleged harassment of Gwyneth Paltrow in 1999. Speaking to ABC News,external, he said: ""I knew the story about Gwyneth [Paltrow] from Ben [Affleck], because he was with her after Brad [Pitt], so I knew that story."" In the same interview George Clooney, whose big-screen break was a Weinstein film, said it is ""beyond infuriating"" that ""predator"" Harvey Weinstein was ""out silencing women"". On Monday, at a film premiere in Los Angeles, he spoke about the need to believe women who speak out about sexual assault. ""Maybe this is the watershed moment, where we believe women, where they feel safe that they can talk about what they're experiencing"", he said. This video can not be played Tom Hanks: ""Everybody has stories about some aspect of the so called casting couch"" George Clooney and Matt Damon join the list of Hollywood stars who have spoken out to condemn Harvey Weinstein.

MP quits committee over offensive remarks,"Labour MP Jared O'Mara has quit the Commons equality committee over online homophobic comments he made before being elected to parliament. Mr O'Mara also made misogynistic remarks, joked about having an orgy with members of Girls Aloud and posted degrading comments about fat people. The Sheffield Hallam MP, 36, was elected in June, unseating ex-deputy prime minister Nick Clegg. Mr O'Mara resigned from the Women and Equalities Committee after apologising. In posts made on the Drowned in Sound music website in 2004, Mr O'Mara claimed singer Michelle McManus only won Pop Idol ""because she was fat"" and said it would be funny if jazz star Jamie Cullum was ""sodomised with his own piano"". The posts were first reported by the Guido Fawkes website, which has since revealed that two years earlier Mr O'Mara made homophobic remarks on an internet forum. The MP has also apologised for these comments and said he was ""deeply ashamed"" of his actions. The Labour leadership described Mr O'Mara's online remarks as ""horrendous"" and ""vile"" but sources said he would not be suspended from the parliamentary party, BBC political correspondent Chris Mason reported. Mr Mason said he understood Mr O'Mara addressed his colleagues at a meeting of Labour MPs and made ""a full and very personal apology"" for his remarks. The@LGBTLabour group tweeted,externalthat it was ""deeply concerned"" by the MP's comments. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Stella Creasy,external, Labour MP for Walthamstow, added she had asked for a meeting with Mr O'Mara to discuss his comments.

Unflattering mugshot man sentenced,"Wayne Esmonde was wanted by South Wales Police in connection with an assault A man who asked police to remove his mugshot from a wanted appeal because it was unflattering has been sentenced for assault. South Wales Policeposted the photoof Wayne Esmonde, 35, from Swansea, on social media when he was wanted for attacking his then-partner. He had an eight month sentence suspended for 18 months after pleading guilty at the city's crown court. The court heard he head butted and threw a bottle at his victim. He had written on the force's Facebook page: ""I am him. Not a very flattering mugshot. ""I'd appreciate it if you'd take this post down. Innocent until proven guilty and all that.""

Director Toback accused of sexual harassment,"James Toback has been a writer and director since the 1970s Oscar-nominated Hollywood film-maker James Toback has been accused by nearly 40 women of sexual harassment. The Los Angeles Times,externalsaid 31 of the women had spoken on the record about their experiences, which span the last 30 years. Toback has denied the allegations and said he had never met any of the women in question or, if he did, it ""was for five minutes and have no recollection"". The writer and director was nominated for best screenplay for 1991's Bugsy. The mobster film starred Warren Beatty and Annette Bening. He has also directed Robert Downey Jr in three films, including Black and White and The Pick-Up Artist. His latest film, The Private Life of a Modern Woman, premiered at the Venice Film Festival last month and stars Sienna Miller. The women interviewed by the LA Times have accused Toback, 72, of masturbating in front of them, rubbing himself up against them, asking inappropriate questions of a sexual nature and asking them to perform sexual acts. One said that after an alleged encounter, she ""felt like a prostitute, an utter disappointment to myself, my parents, my friends"", adding: ""And I deserved not to tell anyone."" Toback told the LA Times that for the past 22 years, it had been ""biologically impossible"" for him to engage in the behaviour described, saying he had diabetes and a heart condition that required medication.

Soldier's widow: Trump 'made me cry',"This video can not be played How one phone call has sparked uproar The widow of a dead US soldier says Donald Trump could not remember her husband's name when he phoned to offer condolences. Myeshia Johnson, widow of Sgt La David Johnson, told ABC News the president's ""stumbling"" and tone ""made me cry"". But President Trump said that he had used Sgt Johnson's name ""without hesitation"" and described the conversation as ""very respectful"". Sgt Johnson waskilled in Nigerby Islamist militants this month. Facebook post defending Trump is fake Five reasons Trump's widow story stings How did US soldiers die in Niger? President Trump's call of condolence made headlines last week when Democratic congresswoman Frederica Wilson - who had heard it along with the family - accused him of insensitivity. This video can not be played Trump war widow row 'lowers presidency' Myeshia Johnson appeared to confirm Ms Wilson's assertion that Mr Trump had told her her husband had known what he had signed up for when joining the military. ""The president said that he knew what he signed up for, but it hurts anyways... It made me cry because I was very angry at the tone of his voice and how he said it,"" she said. ""He had my husband's report in front of him, and that's when he actually said La David. I heard him stumbling on trying to remember my husband's name."" ""If my husband is out here fighting for our country and he risks his life for our country, why can't you remember his name?"" she added. Myeshia Johnson wept on her husband's coffin at his funeral in Hollywood, Florida By Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington The Donald Trump condolence-call story is a White House headache that shows no signs of abating. It started badly for the president, as he responded to a question about US military casualties in Niger by questioning how his predecessors had dealt with the families of war dead. It got worse, as the story morphed into one of an allegedly callous presidential call to Myeshia Johnson, a grieving widow of one of the US soldiers killed in Niger. Now it's devolved into a he-said, she-said debate. Democratic Congresswoman Frederica Wilson - who knew the slain soldier - and Ms Johnson and her family claim the president mishandled the call, while Mr Trump and Chief-of-Staff John Kelly insist everything went smoothly. Needless to say, arguing with a war widow is a no-win situation, regardless of who has facts on their side. President George W Bush notably withstood harsh criticism from some bereaved families during the Iraq War without swiping back. This president is different, which should come as a surprise to no one at this point. His choices could come at a high political price, however.

He has dismissed the account of the phone call given by Ms Wilson as ""totally fabricated"". Speaking to reporters, he said: ""I did not say what she [Ms Wilson] said... I had a very nice conversation."" The White House said Mr Trump's conversations with the families of dead servicemen were private. Sgt Johnson was one of four US special forces soldiers who died in an ambush in Niger. Mr Trump was criticised for not contacting the families of the dead servicemen right after they were killed, or publicly commenting on their deaths until 12 days later when asked by a reporter. He responded to this criticism byfalsely claimingthat his predecessor, Barack Obama, and other former US presidents had not called the relatives of dead service members. This video can not be played Trump denigrates Obama over false fallen soldier claim The row escalated when Mr Trump pointed out that his chief of staff, General John Kelly, after his son was killed in Afghanistan, did not receive a call from President Obama. The White House later said Mr Trump had spoken to the families of those killed in Niger but did not say when. On 4 October, it was reported that three US soldiers on a reconnaissance patrol had been killed and two others wounded in an ambush near the West African nation's border with Mali. Two days later, the body of Sgt Johnson was found by Nigerien forces, said the US military, making him the fourth American to die in the attack. General Joseph Dunford, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said on Monday the Niger attackers had launched the ambush using small arms, rockets and machine guns. He said the initial investigation points to local tribal fighters associated with the so-called Islamic State being the culprits. Some reports suggest up to 50 militants may have ambushed the group. After an hour of battle, the team requested support, Gen Dunford said. It is unclear why it took them so long to call for back-up. Within another hour, French Mirage jets arrived. Later in the afternoon, French attack helicopters and a Nigerian quick reaction force turned up. There are 800 US troops in Niger, more than in any other African nation, said Gen Dunford. They are training local forces to take on Islamist militants, he added. But the level of the deployment seemed to be news to some US congressmen. At leastthree senators,externalsaid on Monday they did not know so many American soldiers were in Niger. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, who sits on the armed services committee, admitted he had ""little insight on why they [the US troops] were there and what they were doing"". Allow Twitter content?

Hawking PhD's popularity crashes website,"Stephen Hawking's handwriting can be seen on the document Demand for Stephen Hawking's PhD thesis intermittently crashed part of Cambridge University's website as physics fans flocked to read his work. Prof Hawking's 1966 thesis ""Properties of expanding universes"" was made freely available for the first time on the publications section of university's website at 00:01 BST. More than 60,000 have so far accessed his work as a 24-year-old postgraduate. Prof Hawking said by making it available he hoped to ""inspire people"". He added: ""Anyone, anywhere in the world should have free, unhindered access to not just my research, but to the research of every great and enquiring mind across the spectrum of human understanding. ""It's wonderful to hear how many people have already shown an interest in downloading my thesis - hopefully they won't be disappointed now that they finally have access to it!"" Professor Hawking is still working at Cambridge University at the age of 75 The 75-year-old's doctoral thesis is the most requested item in Cambridge University's library. Since May 2016, 199 requests were made for the PhD - most of which are believed to be from the general public rather than academics. The next most requested publication was asked for just 13 times. Previously, to read Hawking's PhD in full, people had to pay Â£65 to the university library to scan a copy or physically go to the library to read it. Because of the popularity of the 134-page work the website has, at times, struggled to cope with the volume of users on Monday. But thousands have still been able to read the document by the man who would go on to write A Brief History of Time, one of the most influential scientific works ever. The abstract of his PhD begins: ""Some implications and consequences of the expansion of the universe are examined"". The opening page of Stephen Hawking's PhD, when he was a 24-year-old studying at Trinity Hall Born 8 January 1942 in Oxford, England Earned place at Oxford University to read natural science in 1959, before studying for his PhD at Cambridge By 1963, was diagnosed with motor neurone disease and given two years to live Outlined his theory that Black holes emit ""Hawking radiation"", in 1974 Published his book A Brief History of Time in 1988, which has sold more than 10 million copies His life story was the subject of the 2014 film The Theory of Everything, starring Eddie Redmayne Dr Lauren Cadwallader, deputy head of scholarly communications at Cambridge University, said when Prof Hawking was asked whether he wanted to make his PhD available to all he agreed almost immediately. Dr Cadwallader added she hoped it would be a ""great example for academics writing their theses now that maybe in 51 years' time they'll be having theirs still read"". Cambridge University said it now hoped to encourage its other former academics to make their work available to the public, like Prof Hawking has.

Charges dropped against Dubai Scot,"Jamie Harron had been unable to leave the country since July A Scottish man accused of public indecency in Dubai has had the charges against him dropped after the ruler of the Emirate of Dubai intervened. Jamie Harron, 27, from Stirling, had beensentenced to three months in jailfor touching a man's hip in a bar. Detained in Dubai, the group representing Mr Harron, said he had been exonerated by Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum. It said Mr Harron had his passport returned and is free to leave Dubai. Mr Harron's mother Patricia declined to be interviewed, but told BBC Scotland that the family were ""ecstatic"" at the news. Mr Harron had also been accused of drinking alcohol and making a rude gesture towards the businessman who made the complaint. Detained in Dubai spokeswoman Radha Stirling said: ""The cases against him have been dismissed, and the sentence imposed by the court yesterday has been nullified. ""We wish to express our deepest gratitude to Sheikh Mohammed for his personal intervention in this case, and for exonerating Jamie at long last. ""It has now been established that the allegations against Jamie were entirely unwarranted, defamatory, and meritless."" Ms Stirling said Mr Harron was now considering a civil action against the businessman and his employers. Mr Harron was arrested in July and charged with public indecency. He claimed he had simply been trying to avoid spilling his drink when he touched the man. The man who made the complaint against Mr Harron later withdrew it, but prosecutors in Dubai continued with the case. Mr Harron, who worked as an electrician in Afghanistan, was on a two-day stopover in the United Arab Emirates at the time of the incident. He said he lost his job and has spent more than Â£30,000 in expenses and legal fees as a result of the case. âMisledâ Blairgowrie lodge owners face losing their homes after appeal defeats Falkirk Council planners want to reject 21 homes in Dennyloanhead Plans for 48 homes in Polmont should be rejected say Falkirk Council planners A9 closed northbound near Dunblane after crash New membership packages aim to improve health and well-being Scottish regiment's Boer War experiences to be explored in Stirling lecture At least two killed and 1,000 structures destroyed as wildfires rage in Los Angeles In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?

Gunpowder plot TV scenes upset viewers,"Tom Cullen and Kit Harington play Guy Fawkes and Robert Catesby respectively A BBC drama about the gunpowder plot has drawn criticism for its violence. One viewer,externallabelled an execution scene in Gunpowder ""grotesque and completely unnecessary"", whileanother,externalcalled it ""one of the most painful things I've ever witnessed on TV"". The drama, starring Game of Thrones' Kit Harington, tells of the 1605 plot to blow up the Houses of Parliament. The BBC said the offending scenes were ""grounded in historical fact"" and reflected what took place at the time. The first episode, shown on Saturday, showed a woman being pressed to death and a priest being disembowelled. ""I'd been really looking forward to #Gunpowder but just had to turn off during the first episode,""tweeted,externalone viewer. But another Twitter usersaid,externalthe drama had to be ""graphic & gory... for us to understand the depth of persecution, and why [Robert] Catesby & co did what they did"". The first episode showed a woman being stripped naked and tortured to death The drama began at 21:10 BST, just after the watershed, and was preceded by a warning. In a statement, the BBC said: ""The scenes aired after 9.30pm with a clear warning given to viewers before the episode started.

'Toxic' cars hit with new charge,"The T-charge aims to cut pollution in the capital Drivers of older, more polluting vehicles now have to pay almost twice as much to drive in central London. Mayor Sadiq Khan's Â£10 T-Charge, which mainly applies to diesel and petrol vehicles registered before 2006, has come into force. It covers the same area as the existing congestion charge zone, bumping up the cost to Â£21.50 for those affected. Opponents said the scheme would ""disproportionately penalise London's poorest drivers"". The measure is the latest attempt by Mr Khan to improve air quality in the capital and, according to the mayor's office, will affect 34,000 motorists a month. Old banger vs diesel: Which is more toxic? Reality Check: Does pollution cut short 40,000 lives a year? Pollution warning as London air quality alerts are issued How bad is air pollution in the UK? Speaking on theToday programme, Mr Khan said: ""We've got a health crisis in London caused by the poor quality air. ""Roughly speaking each year more than 9,000 Londoners die prematurely because of the poor quality air - children in our city whose lungs are underdeveloped, with adults who suffer from conditions such as asthma, dementia and strokes directly caused by poor quality air."" However, Simon Birkett, from the campaign group Clean Air London, does not believe the move goes far enough. ""The mayor has pledged in his manifesto to restore London's air quality to legal and safe limits and that means he has to do a whole lot more. ""We want him to take steps which are bigger, stronger and smarter."" Mr Khan has described the introduction of the T-Charge as ""part of a package of measures"" being undertaken. Many people have taken to social media to express their views on the new levy. Daniel McGuiness said on Twitter: ""T-Charge, it's a start but there's still a long way to go in tackling the public health emergency that is our filthy air. #CleanAir"". Allow Twitter content?

From Monday 23 October, there is a Â£10 daily fee for those who drive more polluting vehicles in the congestion charging zone, on top of the existing Â£11.50 congestion charge. Vehicles that do not comply with theEuro IV exhaust standard,externalmust pay the Â£10 charge. The standard defines emissions limits for cars, vans, buses, coaches and lorries. Most vehicles registered before 2006 are likely to exceed these limits. The zone will operate between 07:00 and 18:00, Monday to Friday. You can find out if your car is affected withTfL's T-Charge checker,external. Your questions on the T-Charge answered The T-Charge is the first of a series of new rates being introduced in London. It is due to be replaced by a stricter Ultra-Low Emission Zone in 2020, although Mr Khan is consulting on bringing this forward to 2019. This will mean diesel cars registered before September 2015 and petrol cars registered before 2006 will face a Â£12.50 charge in addition to the Â£11.50 congestion charge. Row over 'pointless' new London congestion charge The Air You Breathe: Analysing the chemicals in the air we exhale T-charge: Is it already changing drivers' behaviour? How toxic is your car exhaust? The mayor hopes to expand the area covered for cars and vans up to the North and South Circular roads in 2021. City authorities in Birmingham, Leeds, Southampton, Derby and Nottingham have also been advised to impose charges for some polluting diesel vehicles by 2020,the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said.,external To tackle air pollution, Oxford City Council and Oxfordshire County Council proposeda ban on petrol and diesel cars in the city centre from 2020. Paris, Grenoble and Lyon introduced an emission sticker scheme in January which splits vehicles into six different groups depending on their Euro Emissions standard. Vehicles deemed too polluting - which includes petrol and diesel-powered cars registered before 1997 - are not granted a sticker, banning them from driving in the city during certain times. The mayor has launched a poster campaign to highlight pollution Sue Terpilowski, from the Federation of Small Businesses, said: ""The introduction of the T-Charge comes at a time when small and micro-businesses in London are already facing astonishingly high property, employment and logistics costs. ""There is a fear that this will be the final straw that closes businesses and takes jobs."" Shaun Bailey, Conservative environment spokesman at the London Assembly, said: ""As an asthmatic I'm well aware of how critical an issue this is for London but we need policies that actually deliver progress. ""By boasting about a policy that so disproportionately penalises London's poorest drivers and puts jobs at risk, the mayor is simply blowing more smoke into the capital's already polluted atmosphere."" Friends of the Earth air pollution campaigner Jenny Bates said: ""Clearly, the last thing individuals want is a new charge for moving around, but the grim reality is that nearly 10,000 early deaths are caused in London each year by the capital's toxic air, so the mayor is right to try to dissuade drivers bringing the oldest, dirtiest vehicles into central London. ""It's only one small step towards clean air though - we urgently need a programme of meaningful financial assistance to help drivers of the dirtiest vehicles switch to something cleaner, and bold policies to cut traffic overall."" The mayor is also seeking new powers to ban wood burning in the most polluted areas of the capital. When asked if wood-burning stoves would be banned entirely, Mr Khan told the Today programme the problem was with the material that was being burnt and a lack of maintenance rather than the stoves themselves.

Juncker: Accounts of PM dinner 'untrue',"This video can not be played Theresa May: We are in touching distance of a deal Theresa May has said ""important progress"" on Brexit was made at last week's EU summit - but Jeremy Corbyn said it sounded like ""Groundhog Day"". The PM said she had a ""degree of confidence"" of making enough progress by December to begin trade talks. She also said there would be no ""physical infrastructure"" on the border in Northern Ireland. Meanwhile, the EU Commission president dismissed a German newspaper's account of his dinner with the PM.

Businesses arecalling for urgent agreementin setting up temporary transition arrangements after the UK's departure date in March 2019. But some pro-EU MPs expressed concern that the UK could leave without one in place, after Mrs May suggested it was dependent on details of the final ""partnership"" being clear. ""The point of the implementation period is to put in place the practical changes necessary to move to the future partnership,"" she said as she updated MPs on last week's summit. ""In order to have that, you need to know what the future partnership is going to be.""

UK diver swims for miles after shark scare,"This video can not be played A British man has told the BBC how he swam over four miles to safety after being ""followed"" by a tiger shark. A British diver says he swam 7.5km (4.5 miles) to safety off the coast of Australia after losing sight of his boat and being ""followed"" by a shark. John Craig, 34, had been spear-fishing underwater in Western Australia on Friday when he surfaced and could not see the boat, being crewed by a friend. Mr Craig said he noticed a shark as he called and splashed for help. He then began a long swim back to shore before reaching land and walking for another 30 minutes until he was seen. The Sunderland man, an experienced diver who moved to Australia two years ago, said the shark had appeared to be a tiger shark about 4m in length. ""It was extremely close and curious and kept approaching me from different angles. It was trying to work out what I was and whether I could be on the menu,"" he told the BBC. ""It was terrifying. I thought I was just going to be eaten out here in the middle of nowhere... this shark is just not leaving me alone."" Mr Craig said he placed his spear gun between himself and the shark as it swam around him in Shark Bay, about 800km north of Perth, the state capital. He then decided to swim towards the Francois Perron National Park after spotting a red cliff ""very low on the horizon"". But Mr Craig said he was followed by the ""curious"" shark for about 15 minutes. Surfer Mick Fanning in another shark scare How drones are protecting beachgoers The diver said he was thankful he was able to complete the swim ""At this point I thought I was gone - 4 nautical miles out to sea with a huge tiger shark following me - I thought this was it, this is how I am going to die,"" he said. ""I would look back and see its head come out of the gloom and at my fins, keeping pace with me."" He said he felt almost like the shark was ""escorting"" him to shore, but after a time it disappeared. Mr Craig estimated he swam for another three hours before reaching land, where he noticed an air and sea rescue effort was under way. Unable to gain anyone's attention, Mr Craig began walking towards a campsite until a plane spotted him about 30 minutes later. ""I could not believe that someone could swim that far in such a short period of time,"" said Glen Ridgley, from Shark Bay Volunteer Marine Rescue. ""I guess where there's a shark besides you spurring you on... it's like a trainer."" Mr Craig was reunited with his wife aboard one of the rescue boats. He has praised the quick response of the area's search and rescue authorities. His original boat had experienced mechanical issues but his friend was OK, Mr Craig said. Tiger sharks are responsible for the second-highest number of reported attacks on humans, according to theInternational Shark Attack File,external.

Catalans 'won't follow Madrid's orders',"This video can not be played Catalan president's message to Europe on Sunday Catalan authorities will not follow orders from the Spanish government if Madrid moves to reassert control over the region, a senior official says. A regional government spokesman told the BBC that the central government was acting against the will of Catalans. Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy has announced plans to sack the region's government and curtail some of the powers of its parliament. The Catalan parliament will meet on Thursday to decide on its response. The pro-independence leaders could decide to formalise a unilateral declaration of independence, the BBC's Bethany Bell in Barcelona reports. The Spanish Senate is expected to approve the government's measures on Friday along with a proposal for fresh regional elections. The Catalan government, led by President Carles Puigdemont, has refused to halt an independence drive following an outlawed referendum held earlier this month. This video can not be played Raul Romeva says direct Spanish rule would put into question the survival of ""EU democracy"" On Saturday, Mr Rajoy said he was triggering Article 155 of the constitution - an unprecedented move - which allows for direct rule to be imposed in a crisis on any of the country's autonomous regions. But Catalan leaders say they will not accept the plan. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, foreign affairs spokesman Raul Romeva said: ""How can the European Union live with that situation [if this happens]? ""Because what I can tell you is that the people and the institutions in Catalonia will not let this happen."" He said the Spanish government needed to recognise that the people of the region had voted for independence. Cases for and against independence Catalan crisis in 300 words The Catalan government said that of the 43% who took part in the 1 October referendum, 90% were in favour of independence. Unionist parties who won about 40% of the vote at the 2015 Catalan elections boycotted the ballot. Apart from stripping Mr Puigdemont of all his powers, the central government will also seek to take control of Catalonia's police force and its public broadcaster, TV3, reports suggest. Pro-independence posters and graffiti in Barcelona Mr Rajoy insisted the measures would not mean Catalan self-government itself was being suspended and that they were intended to remove the people who had taken illegal action. The country's Deputy Prime Minister, Soraya SÃ¡enz de SantamarÃ­a, told Spanish radioOnda Cero (in Spanish),externalthat Catalan leaders were ""completely not in compliance with the constitution and the statute of autonomy"". Reality Check: Would Catalonia be a viable country? Once the Senate approves Article 155, Mr Puigdemont will stop receiving a salary and will not be able to carry out his functions, she added. This video can not be played Catalan police caught in a political crisis Catalonia's far-left CUP party - a key support for Mr Puigdemont's minority government in the regional parliament - has warned of a campaign of ""massive civil disobedience"" if Madrid imposes direct rule on the region. Spanish media report that the Catalan leader is planning to present his arguments to a commission of the Spanish Senate on Wednesday, but this has yet to be confirmed. There have been calls by Mr Puigdemont's supporters to declare a snap election before direct rule becomes effective. The EU has refused to back the drive for Catalan independence and saidthe crisis was for Spain to resolve.

Hunt for fugitive focuses on family,"Mark Acklom is likely to be with his wife Maria Rodriguez, police say Detectives hunting a man accused of conning a wealthy divorcee out of her life savings have released details of his family in an attempt to find him. Mark Acklom, 44, wasnamed among the 10 most wanted British fugitivesliving in Spain, last October. A woman with whom he had a relationship said he posed as an MI6 agent before disappearing with Â£850,000 she had lent him. Avon and Somerset Police have released a photograph of Mr Acklom's wife. Police believe Maria Yolanda Ros Rodriguez, 47, is likely to be with him and could be assisting him, although she is not the subject of a European Arrest Warrant. Mark Acklom was apparently photographed in Geneva in May Det Insp Adam Bunting said: ""We believe he'll be with his wife Maria Rodriguez and their two young daughters, who we know up until last year's appeal, were enrolled in El Limonar International School in the Murcia area of Spain. ""In the days following the appeal he removed his children from the school and, together with his wife, he disappeared. He said there were ""significant concerns"" about the children's wellbeing due to them being ""uprooted, with no notice, from their school, friends and family"". This video can not be played Carolyn Woods talks about how Mark Acklom convinced her he was an MI6 agent ""It's highly likely Acklom will have placed his children in another fee-paying school,"" he added. A spokesman said police particularly want to hear from British expats with children in a private international school abroad, who may have noticed the recent arrival of a family from Spain, with daughters aged six and eight. They said Ms Rodriguez may be using the aliases Yolanda Ross, Maria Long or Mary Moss, and may be teaching or attending yoga classes. Det Insp Bunting added: ""We also have information linking him to Dublin and Italy, but he could be anywhere in Europe. It's possible he may have travelled outside the EU."" In May this year Mr Acklom wasapparently photographed in Geneva, Switzerland, but has not been sighted since. Earlier this year Carolyn Woods, who was working in a boutique in Tetbury, Gloucestershire, when she met him,criticised police for not doing enough to catch Mr Acklom. She described how he told her he was a wealthy Swiss banker and MI6 agent before disappearing with her life savings in 2012. Ms Woods said she gave evidence to Avon and Somerset Police, in July 2015, that Mr Acklom was in custody in Spain, but by the time they had got a European Arrest Warrant a year later he had been released.

Widow of fallen soldier hits out at Trump,"This video can not be played How one phone call has sparked uproar The widow of a dead US soldier says Donald Trump could not remember her husband's name when he phoned to offer condolences. Myeshia Johnson, widow of Sgt La David Johnson, told ABC News the president's ""stumbling"" and tone ""made me cry"". But President Trump said that he had used Sgt Johnson's name ""without hesitation"" and described the conversation as ""very respectful"". Sgt Johnson waskilled in Nigerby Islamist militants this month. Facebook post defending Trump is fake Five reasons Trump's widow story stings How did US soldiers die in Niger? President Trump's call of condolence made headlines last week when Democratic congresswoman Frederica Wilson - who had heard it along with the family - accused him of insensitivity. This video can not be played Trump war widow row 'lowers presidency' Myeshia Johnson appeared to confirm Ms Wilson's assertion that Mr Trump had told her her husband had known what he had signed up for when joining the military. ""The president said that he knew what he signed up for, but it hurts anyways... It made me cry because I was very angry at the tone of his voice and how he said it,"" she said. ""He had my husband's report in front of him, and that's when he actually said La David. I heard him stumbling on trying to remember my husband's name."" ""If my husband is out here fighting for our country and he risks his life for our country, why can't you remember his name?"" she added. Myeshia Johnson wept on her husband's coffin at his funeral in Hollywood, Florida By Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington The Donald Trump condolence-call story is a White House headache that shows no signs of abating. It started badly for the president, as he responded to a question about US military casualties in Niger by questioning how his predecessors had dealt with the families of war dead. It got worse, as the story morphed into one of an allegedly callous presidential call to Myeshia Johnson, a grieving widow of one of the US soldiers killed in Niger. Now it's devolved into a he-said, she-said debate. Democratic Congresswoman Frederica Wilson - who knew the slain soldier - and Ms Johnson and her family claim the president mishandled the call, while Mr Trump and Chief-of-Staff John Kelly insist everything went smoothly. Needless to say, arguing with a war widow is a no-win situation, regardless of who has facts on their side. President George W Bush notably withstood harsh criticism from some bereaved families during the Iraq War without swiping back. This president is different, which should come as a surprise to no one at this point. His choices could come at a high political price, however.

He has dismissed the account of the phone call given by Ms Wilson as ""totally fabricated"". Speaking to reporters, he said: ""I did not say what she [Ms Wilson] said... I had a very nice conversation."" The White House said Mr Trump's conversations with the families of dead servicemen were private. Sgt Johnson was one of four US special forces soldiers who died in an ambush in Niger. Mr Trump was criticised for not contacting the families of the dead servicemen right after they were killed, or publicly commenting on their deaths until 12 days later when asked by a reporter. He responded to this criticism byfalsely claimingthat his predecessor, Barack Obama, and other former US presidents had not called the relatives of dead service members. This video can not be played Trump denigrates Obama over false fallen soldier claim The row escalated when Mr Trump pointed out that his chief of staff, General John Kelly, after his son was killed in Afghanistan, did not receive a call from President Obama. The White House later said Mr Trump had spoken to the families of those killed in Niger but did not say when. On 4 October, it was reported that three US soldiers on a reconnaissance patrol had been killed and two others wounded in an ambush near the West African nation's border with Mali. Two days later, the body of Sgt Johnson was found by Nigerien forces, said the US military, making him the fourth American to die in the attack. General Joseph Dunford, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said on Monday the Niger attackers had launched the ambush using small arms, rockets and machine guns. He said the initial investigation points to local tribal fighters associated with the so-called Islamic State being the culprits. Some reports suggest up to 50 militants may have ambushed the group. After an hour of battle, the team requested support, Gen Dunford said. It is unclear why it took them so long to call for back-up. Within another hour, French Mirage jets arrived. Later in the afternoon, French attack helicopters and a Nigerian quick reaction force turned up. There are 800 US troops in Niger, more than in any other African nation, said Gen Dunford. They are training local forces to take on Islamist militants, he added. But the level of the deployment seemed to be news to some US congressmen. At leastthree senators,externalsaid on Monday they did not know so many American soldiers were in Niger. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, who sits on the armed services committee, admitted he had ""little insight on why they [the US troops] were there and what they were doing"". Allow Twitter content?

British IS fighters 'must be killed',"The ""only way"" to deal with British IS fighters in Syria is ""in almost every case"" to kill them, the minister for international development has said. Rory Stewart said converts to so-called Islamic State believed in an ""extremely hateful doctrine"" and had moved away from any allegiance to Britain. They can expect to be killed because of the ""serious danger"" they pose to the UK's security, he said. The government said his comments were in line with the UK's stated position. Mr Stewart made the remarks after Brett McGurk, a top US envoy for the coalition fighting IS, said his mission was to ensure every foreign fighter in Syria dies there. Asked about the comments on BBC Radio 5 Live'sPienaar's Politics, Mr Stewart, a former diplomat, said they were ""very difficult moral issues"". He said: ""They are absolutely dedicated, as members of the Islamic State, towards the creation of a caliphate. ""They believe in an extremely hateful doctrine which involves killing themselves, killing others and trying to use violence and brutality to create an 8th Century, or 7th Century, state. ""So I'm afraid we have to be serious about the fact these people are a serious danger to us, and unfortunately, the only way of dealing with them will be, in almost every case, to kill them."" Where have fleeing IS fighters gone? Who are Britainâs jihadists? RAF 'has killed 3,000 IS fighters' Mr Stewart's comments contrast with the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, who recently told the BBC that Britons who join IS through ""naivety"" should be spared prosecution if they return home. Max Hill QC said UK authorities should instead look at reintegrating such people. When the question of rehabilitation was put to Mr Stewart on theBBC Asian Network, he said that his original comments referred to fighters still on the ground in Syria and Iraq. ""If they came back to the UK they need to be arrested and tried in accordance with normal British law,"" he said. ""And then you need to work with them as you work with anyone else."" A government spokesman said Mr Stewart's remarks were consistent with the position set out by Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon on 12 October. Sir Michael said British IS fighters in Syria and Iraq had made themselves ""a legitimate target"" who could end up on ""the wrong end of an RAF or USAF missile"". His comments came after it was reported thatBritish IS recruiter Sally-Anne Jones had been killed in a US drone strike in Syria in June. The head of MI5 revealed this month thatmore than 130 Britons who travelled to Iraq and Syria to fight with the terror group have died. Mr Stewart also said British authorities had made it ""very clear"" that people should not be volunteering with militia groups to fight against IS.

Jodie Whittaker, who takes over as the 13th Doctor next year, will be joined by Bradley Walsh, Tosin Cole and Mandip Gill, as well as Sharon D Clarke in a returning role. Walsh will star as Graham, Cole will play Ryan and Gill will play Yasmin. Walsh said he was looking forward to being part of the show - some 50 years after first becoming a fan. This is just another interesting career move for the man with one of the most varied CVs in showbusiness. Walsh is best-known for hosting game shows like The Chase and Wheel of Fortune, and will be familiar to Coronation Street fans for playing Danny Baldwin between 2004-06. He started out as a professional footballer for Brentford FC and launched a music career last year - notching up the biggest-selling debut album of 2016 by a British artist. This isn't his first experience of the world of Doctor Who - Walsh says he's watched the show for 50 years and even briefly appeared as a villain in spin-off show Sarah Jane Adventures in 2008.

The most influential work in the history of capitalism?,"Renaissance mathematician Luca Pacioli is seen as the father of double-entry bookkeeping In 1495 or thereabouts, Leonardo da Vinci himself, the genius's genius, noted down a list of things to do in one of his famous notebooks. These to-do lists, written in mirror-writing and interspersed with sketches, are magnificent. ""Find a master of hydraulics and get him to tell you how to repair a lock, canal and mill in the Lombard manner."" ""Draw Milan."" ""Learn multiplication from the root from Maestro Luca."" Leonardo was a big fan of Maestro Luca, better known today as Luca Pacioli. Pacioli was, appropriately enough, a Renaissance Man: - educated for a life in commerce, but also a conjuror, a chess master, a lover of puzzles, a Franciscan Friar, and a professor of mathematics. Today he is celebrated as the most famous accountant who ever lived. 50 Things That Made the Modern Economyhighlights the inventions, ideas and innovations which have helped create the economic world in which we live. It is broadcast on the BBC World Service. You can findmore information about the programme's sourcesandlisten onlineorsubscribe to the programme podcast. Pacioli is often called the father of double-entry bookkeeping, but he didn't invent it. The double-entry system - known in its day as ""bookkeeping alla Veneziana,"" or ""in the Venetian style"" - was being used two centuries earlier, around 1300. The Venetians had abandoned as impractical the Roman system of writing numbers, and were instead embracing Arabic numerals. Venice in the 1300s - when Marco Polo set off on his famous travels to the Far East - was already a sophisticated crossroads of trade and ideas They may have also taken the idea of double-entry book keeping from the Islamic world, or even from India, where there are tantalising hints that double-entry bookkeeping techniques date back thousands of years. Or it may have been a local Venetian invention, repurposing the new Arabic mathematics for commercial ends. Before the Venetian style caught on, accounts were rather basic. Early medieval merchants were little more than travelling salesmen. They had no need to keep accounts - they could simply check whether their purse was full or empty. But as the commercial enterprises of the Italian city states grew larger, and became more dependent on financial instruments such as loans and currency trades, the need for a more careful reckoning became painfully clear. We have a remarkable record of the business affairs of Francesco di Marco Datini, a merchant from Prato, near Florence, who kept accounts for nearly half a century, from 1366 to 1410. They begin as little more than a financial diary, but as his business grew more complex, he needed something more sophisticated. We can see how Datini tracked his increasingly intricate financial transactions Late in 1394, Datini orders wool from Mallorca. Six months later the sheep are shorn. Several months after that, 29 sacks of wool arrive in Pisa, via Barcelona. The wool is coiled into 39 bales. Of these, 21 go to a customer in Florence and 18 go to Datini's warehouse, arriving in 1396, over a year after the initial order. They are then processed by more than 100 separate subcontractors. Eventually, six long cloths go back to Mallorca via Venice, but don't sell, so are hawked in Valencia and North Africa instead. The last cloth is sold in 1398, nearly four years after Datini's original order. Fortunately, he had been using bookkeeping alla Veneziana for more than a decade, so was able to keep track of this extraordinarily intricate web of transactions. So what, a century later, did the much lauded Luca Pacioli add to the discipline of bookkeeping? Quite simply, in 1494, he wrote the book. ""Summa de Arithmetica, Geometria, Proportioni et Proportionalita"" was an enormous survey of everything that was known about mathematics - 615 large and densely typeset pages. Amidst this colossal textbook, Pacioli included 27 pages that are regarded by many as the most influential work in the history of capitalism. It was the first description of double-entry bookkeeping to be set out clearly, in detail and with plenty of examples. Pacioli's book was sped on its way by a new technology: half a century after Gutenberg developed the movable type printing press, Venice was a centre of the printing industry. His book enjoyed a long print run of 2,000 copies, and was widely translated, copied, and plagiarised across Europe. Double-entry bookkeeping was slow to catch on, perhaps because it was technically demanding and unnecessary for simple businesses. But after Pacioli it was always regarded as the pinnacle of the art. This 1585 woodcut shows a German merchant's accountant doing double-entry bookkeeping As the industrial revolution unfolded, the ideas that Pacioli had set out came to be seen as fundamental to business life. The system used across the world today is essentially the one that Pacioli described. Pacioli's system has two key elements. First, he describes a method for taking an inventory, and then keeping on top of day-to-day transactions using two books - a rough memorandum and a tidier, more organised journal. Then he uses a third book - the ledger - as the foundation of the system, the double-entries themselves. Every transaction was recorded twice in the ledger. If you sell cloth for a ducat, you must account for both the cloth and the ducat. The double-entry system helps to catch errors, because every entry should be balanced by a counterpart, a divine-like symmetry which appealed to a Renaissance Man. It was during the industrial revolution that double-entry bookkeeping became seen not just as an exercise for mathematical perfectionists, but as a tool to guide practical business decisions. One of the first to see this was Josiah Wedgwood, the pottery entrepreneur. At first, Wedgwood, flush with success and fat margins, didn't bother with detailed accounts. Josiah Wedgwood used the insight gleaned from detailed accounts to weather a severe recession But in 1772, Europe faced a severe recession and demand for Wedgwood's ornate crockery collapsed. His warehouses began to fill with unsold stock and workers stood idle. Wedgwood turned to double-entry bookkeeping to understand where in his business the profits were, and how to expand them. He realised how much each piece of work was costing him - a deceptively simple-sounding question - and calculated that he should actually expand production and cut prices to boost business. Others followed, and the discipline of ""management accounting"" was born - an ever-growing system of metrics and benchmarks and targets, that has led us inexorably to the modern world. How the invention of paper changed the world The warrior monks who invented banking How the world's first accountants counted on cuneiform What tally sticks tell us about how money works But in that modern world, accounting does have another role. It's about ensuring that shareholders in a business receive a fair share of corporate profits - when only the accountants can say what those profits really are. Here the track record is not encouraging. Enron's collapse in 2001 was the biggest in US corporate history A string of 21st century scandals - Enron, Worldcom, Parmalat, and the financial crisis of 2008 - have shown us that audited accounts do not completely protect investors. A business may, through fraud or mismanagement, be on the verge of collapse. Yet we cannot guarantee that the accounts will warn us of this. Accounting fraud is not a new game. The first companies to require major capital investment were the British railways of the 1830s and 1840s, which needed vast upfront investment before they could earn anything from customers. Investors poured in, and when railway magnates could not pay the dividends that the investors expected, they simply faked their accounts. The entire railway bubble had collapsed in ignominy by 1850. Perhaps the railway investors should have read up on their Geoffrey Chaucer, writing around the same time as Francesco Datini, the merchant of Prato. Accountancy did not protect Chaucer's Shipman character from an audacious con In Chaucer's Shipman's Tale, a rich merchant is too tied up with his accounts to notice his wife being wooed by a clergyman. Nor do those accounts rescue him from an audacious con. The clergyman borrows the merchant's money, gives it to the merchant's wife - buying his way into her bed with her own husband's cash - and then tells the merchant he's repaid the debt, and to ask his wife where the money is. Accountancy is a powerful financial technology - but it does not protect us from outright fraud, and it may well lure us into complacency. As the neglected wife tells her rich husband, his nose buried in his accounts: ""the devil take all such reckonings!""

"Patients 'need rest, not antibiotics'","More patients should be told to go home and rest rather than be given antibiotics, according to health officials. Public Health England (PHE) says up to a fifth of antibiotic prescriptions are unnecessary as many illnesses get better on their own. Overusing the drugs is making infections harder to treat by creating drug-resistant superbugs. PHE says patients have ""a part to play"" in stopping the rise of infections. It is estimated: 5,000 people die in England each year as a result of drug-resistant infections Four in 10 cases of bloodstream E. coli infections now cannot be treated with first-choice antibiotics By 2050, drug-resistant infections around the world are expected to kill more people than currently die from cancer Antibiotics are vital in cases of sepsis, pneumonia, bacterial meningitis and other severe infections. But PHE says antibiotics are not essential for every illness. Coughs or bronchitis can take up to three weeks to clear on their own, but antibiotics reduce that by only one to two days, it says. Prof Paul Cosford, medical director at PHE, told the BBC: ""We don't often need antibiotics for common conditions. ""The majority of us will get infections from time to time and will recover because of our own immunity."" He said patients should not go to their doctor ""expecting an antibiotic"". Instead, for infections that our body can handle, the advice is to: have plenty of rest use pain relief such as paracetamol drink plenty of fluids Prof Cosford said: ""A doctor will be able to tell you when an antibiotic is really necessary. ""The fact is if you take an antibiotic when you don't need it then you're more likely to have an infection that the antibiotics don't work for over the coming months."" The Keep Antibiotics Working campaign will also see patients handed leaflets explaining how long it normally takes to recover and the warning signs of serious illness. Analysis: Antibiotic apocalypse World on cusp of 'post-antibiotic era' Oral sex spreading unstoppable bacteria Super-gonorrhoea's spread 'causing huge concern' Bacteria are incredibly cunning - once you start attacking them with antibiotics, they find ways of surviving.People have died from bugs resistantto all antibiotics. England's chief medical officer, Prof Dame Sally Davies, has already warned of a ""post-antibiotic apocalypse"". This video can not be played Antibiotics 'may be lost' through overuse, says chief medical officer If the drugs fail, then not only do infections become harder to treat, but common medical procedures such as caesarean sections and cancer treatments could become too risky. The most serious drug-resistant infections are sent to PHE's laboratories at Colindale, north London, for analysis. Prof Neil Woodford, the site's head of antimicrobial resistance, said the most potent antibiotics, like carbapenems, were failing more often. He told the BBC: ""If we go back to 2005/07, we were seeing these bacteria in maybe two to four cases per year. ""Last year we confirmed these resistant bacteria in over 2,000 cases.""

Business bodies call for Brexit clarity,"David Davis is holding Brexit talks in Paris on Monday The UK risks losing jobs and investment without an urgent Brexit transition deal, Britain's five biggest business lobby groups have warned. In a joint letter being sent to Brexit Secretary David Davis, the groups including the CBI and Institute of Directors, say time is running out. The head of the CBI said firms wanted an agreement on the transition period by the end of the year. A government spokesman said the talks were ""making real, tangible progress"". The other lobby groups backing the letter are the British Chambers of Commerce, the Federation of Small Businesses, and the EEF manufacturers' body. CBI director-general Carolyn Fairbairn told the BBC: ""One of the big messages from firms is 'get on with it' on both sides. ""This is real, this is urgent and a transition agreement by the end of the year would help enormously to keep investment and jobs in the country,"" she said. Theresa May has suggested a transition period of about two years, with the UK and EU trading on broadly similar terms to now and payments to Brussels to meet Britain's budget commitments. Firms in the City of London are drawing up Brexit contingency plans But although EU negotiators have agreed to start preliminary work on a future relationship, they still want more concessions on the UK's so-called ""divorce payment"" before starting talks on trade and transition. The five business bodies - which together represent firms employing millions of people - are calling for more urgency, with less than a year and a half left until the UK leaves the European Union. Reality Check: Why Brexit transition may not buy time Brexit deadlock talk 'exaggerated' - Tusk Concern about the loss of UK jobs and investment was underlined last week when the boss of investment banking giant Goldman Sachs, Lloyd Blankfein,tweetedthat he will be ""spending a lot more time"" in Frankfurt. Earlier this month, the deputy governor of the Bank of England, Sam Woods,warnedthat the UK and the EU must agree a transition deal by Christmas or companies would start triggering contingency plans. And in a survey released on Monday, the EEF said that Brexit uncertainty was holding back the plans of manufacturing firms to invest in new plants and machinery. Mr Davis is holding Brexit talks in Paris on Monday after France appeared to emerge as the most hardline EU member state when it comes to the divorce bill. The prime minister is also due to update the Commons on the progress made during last week's summit of EU leaders in Brussels. It is thought that Mrs May will say that negotiations are ""deeply technical"", but she has not forgotten that the lives of millions of people are at the heart of the process. A spokesman for the Department for Exiting the European Union said the prime minister proposed a strictly time-limited implementation period in her Florence speech. He said: ""We are making real and tangible progress in a number of vital areas in negotiations. However, many of the issues that remain are linked to the discussions we need to have on our future relationship. ""That is why we are pleased that the EU has now agreed to start internal preparatory discussions on the framework for transitional arrangements as well as our future partnership.""

Where have fleeing IS fighters gone?,"Driven out of their de facto capital of Raqqa after three brutal years, IS fighters have lost much of the territory they once held. How real is the danger they will now travel to other countries to carry out attacks, asks Dr Lorenzo Vidino. As the self-declared Islamic State steadily crumbles in Iraq and Syria, security officials throughout the world are asking themselves a crucial question: what will happen to its fighters? Roughly30,000 foreign fighters joined IS,externaland there is concern that these battle-hardened individuals will return home, or move elsewhere, carrying out terrorist attacks to avenge the demise of the ""caliphate"". While difficult to forecast, the changing fortunes of IS will undoubtedly have major implications for global security. There are indications, including anassessment by US counter-terrorism officials,external, that some foreign fighters will stay in Syria and Iraq. The head of the UK security service MI5 said this week that fewer than expected of the 800 Britons who joined IShad returned recentlyand that at least 130 had been killed. Those foreign fighters who do remain are likely to continue with IS as the group morphs into what it was in its early days, some 10 years ago: a lethal insurgent force using tactics ranging from terrorist attacks to guerrilla warfare. Foreign fighters have been over-represented among militants making last, desperate stands in thebattles of MosulandRaqqa. And many of them are now being tried in Iraqi courts, creating legal and moral dilemmas for many of their countries of origin, assome may face the death penalty.,external However, many other fighters have been leaving the ""caliphate"", mostly through the 822km (510 mile) long border between Turkey and Syria. While Turkish authorities have been patrolling with significantly more zeal than in the past, mountainous terrain and the presence of sophisticated smuggling networks mean the border is quite permeable. IS has a long-established support network throughout Turkey, which is playing a key role in extracting foreign fighters from Syria. Given the scores of attacks that have bloodied the country over the last three years, Turkish authorities are understandably concerned about this influx. Neighbouring countries, such as Jordan and Lebanon, have similar fears. The potential end destinations for foreign fighters leaving Syria and Iraq are plentiful. There is evidence that some have joined the official wilayat, or ""provinces"", IS has established inYemen, theSinai Peninsula,external, theNorth Caucasus,externalandEast Asia.,external The group also has a strong presence in Libya, where the US suggested last year that it hadup to 6,500 fighters,external, and several hundred in Afghanistan, where the US reportedkilling at least 94 fighters,externalin an attack on underground tunnels. Marawi in the Philippines has been partly held by fighters linked to IS since May There are also anecdotal indications of militants travelling to conflicts in far flung places such as theDemocratic Republic of Congo,external,Myanmar,externaland thePhilippines,external. The arrival of foreign fighters to these regions could strengthen the capabilities of local jihadist groups and change the course of sometimes devastating conflicts. Many other foreign fighters are choosing to return to their countries of origin. While some returnees may no longer engage in militant activities, others areestablishing clandestine networks,externalseeking to carry out attacks and, according to local circumstances, destabilise the country's political situation. North African countries are particularly vulnerable to the risk - nowhere more so than Tunisia, asabout 6,000 of its citizens left,externalto join IS - the highest per capita rate in the world. Arab Gulf countries may also suffer from this type of blowback. Russia, the Caucasus, and a number of Central Asian countries are also areas of concern, having seen large numbers join IS - many of whom went on to play a prominent role on the battlefield. European authorities consider the return of some of the estimated6,000 European foreign fighters,externala major security concern. To date, fewer than one in five individuals involved in attacks on the West since the ""caliphate"" was declared in 2014 had experience as foreign fighters, according to research by the Italian Institute for International Political Studies (ISPI) and the George Washington University's Program on Extremism. The Paris attacks were carried out in part by former foreign fighters Who was behind the jihadist attacks on the West? Who are Britain's jihadists? The archaeological treasures IS failed to destroy But this might change as the number of returnees - now estimated at roughly 1,000 -  increases. Many may show no sign of wishing to engage in further violent activities, but there is a valid concern that some may make use of their combat skills. It is plausible that they could use their network of contacts and ""celebrity status"" among unaffiliated jihad enthusiasts to plan terrorist attacks. The territorial losses suffered by IS are not likely to affect the operational ability of these largely independent militants. While significant problems still exist, European authorities have improved intelligence sharing to better detect returning fighters. And thanks to improved co-operation with Turkey, many militants have been arrested before they get any further. A few do manage to reach Europe illegally, or by posing as refugees - as some of theNovember 2015 Paris attackersdid. But most foreign fighters will come to Europe legally, often using their genuine European passports. If detecting them is a problem, working out what to do with them is equally fraught. Arresting them may be the obvious answer, but the reality is significantly more complicated. The UK Home Office, for example, disclosed last year that of the 400 British foreign fighters who had returned from Syria and Iraq,only 54 were convicted,external. Similar dynamics can be observed throughout the continent. Inside Raqqa after IS pushed out The city fit for no one Raqqa's loss seals rapid rise and fall What is preventing authorities from arresting, prosecuting and convicting returning foreign fighters? It is mostly a legal matter, with lawmakers struggling to keep up with a constantly shifting threat environment. While legislations vary from country to country, they share some common problems. In some countries, joining a terrorist organisation or fighting in a foreign conflict were not criminal offences at the time when most individuals travelled to Syria. Several countries have since introduced new laws which, however, cannot be applied retrospectively. Even in countries where such actions have long constituted criminal offences, authorities struggle to gather the evidence needed to build a strong criminal case. Knowing that somebody joined IS or committed atrocities in Syria from an intelligence perspective is one thing. Being able to prove that beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law is another. Even more complicated is the issue of children either born or raised in the ""caliphate"" by their foreign fighter parents. While most are not punishable under the law, they deserve attention because of the trauma they have suffered and, in some cases, because they present severe signs of radicalism despite their young age. The result is that authorities are overwhelmed, having to monitor hundreds of battle-hardened fighters, on top of the burgeoning number of home-grown IS sympathisers, in an attempt to determine which pose an immediate security threat. Instead, authorities throughout Europe have increasingly invested in programmes seeking to deradicalise returning foreign fighters. While it might be premature to definitively assess them, there are indications that some, like the one established in the Danish city of Aarhus -offering rehabilitation and inclusion in society,external, are effective. Others, like the French plan to set up 12deradicalisation centres,external, have been shelved. The loss of much of its territory is a major blow to ISIS. Yet the group and its adherents are already surfacing in various parts of the world and are likely to do so with even more frequency and vehemence in the near future. IS will become a more decentralised, amorphous organisation operating in a more asymmetric fashion, but it will not disappear. Moreover, the IS brand and the emotional appeal of its ""caliphate"" are unlikely to vanish any time soon. And, despite critical challenges, the organisation's remarkably strong digital presence, the so-called ""virtual caliphate"", will survive in some form, potentially rekindling the commitment of sympathisers worldwide and prompting some to carry out terrorist attacks in its name. The fall of the ""caliphate"" closes a chapter, but a new one is about to be opened.

Why I've delayed the date of my death,"Colin Campbell was scheduled to die on Thursday 15 June 2017. He was due to travel to an assisted death clinic in Switzerland and end his life after 56 years. But an encounter with a stranger led him to postpone his appointment and give life another go. ""I was quite surprised to wake up on the Friday,"" he says. ""The Thursday morning was unusual as I had publicly declared it would be the day of my death and I'd been so prepared I'd be gone, but I'm still here."" Colin, from Inverness, had reached his decision having been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS) in 1995 after he started to find it more difficult to take part in sport. The condition attacks the nervous system, and although it's not terminal it is progressive. Colin's mobility started to decline and as the MS progressed over the following months he had no choice but to leave his job as an IT consultant. He became more vulnerable to illnesses and, as a single man in a second-floor flat with no lift, he felt like a ""prisoner"" in his own home, unable to get in and out easily. Over time, he slowly lost contact with friends. ""I decided I couldn't cope with another winter after I was hospitalised twice within three months,"" he says. By April 2017, he decided the best solution was to apply to a Swiss service which facilitates assisted voluntary suicide, and was quickly approved for the procedure. Assisted suicide is unlawful in Scotland. A move to change the law was defeated in a vote in the Scottish Parliament in 2015. While he waited out the final few months, Colin took part in a television programme for STV about legalising assisted voluntary suicide. Rona Tynan happened to have the TV on that night and stepped into his story. ""I heard the words 'multiple sclerosis' and 'Inverness',"" she says. ""So I dashed to the telly in my wheelchair and listened to Colin's story. I felt desperate that he was feeling he had to take this action."" Rona was from the same city and also has MS. It has impaired the movement in her left side and started to weaken her right side too. A wife and mother, she says she has an active and happy life, although a year ago she had felt similarly hopeless. When her cousin realised Rona wasn't getting the help she was entitled to, social services were quickly contacted and more support was established. ""My big concern was whether Colin had in place all the correct back-up to give him a better quality of life and I really wanted to try and see if I could help him,"" she says. ""I didn't want him to think that I was disrespecting his decision, but I didn't want to think that a man had gone to his death because he hadn't got proper help."" Colin and Rona join the BBC Ouch team in the studio for an emotional conversation about how a person comes to contemplate assisted death, the available support and controversial stem cell treatment. Also on the programme is journalist and anti-assisted suicide campaigner Mik Scarlet, comedian and mental health campaigner Juliette Burton and comedian Tom Skelton. Listen to the To Switzerland - Or Not podcasthere. Rona's concerns were well-founded. When they met, with just a few weeks to go before the deadline, she discovered Colin was poorly informed of the assistance available to him, including how something as simple as a mobility scooter might help. ""I'm a girl that likes to get about town and a scooter basically gave me my life back. I wanted Colin to try this so he's not stuck and isolated,"" she says. ""Sometimes you think you haven't got a lot going for you, but I feel fresh air, people and friends would make a big difference in Colin's life."" How MS ended an England footballer's career Assisted dying: What do disabled people think? Caroline Wyatt: MS 'brain fog' lifted after stem cell treatment Rona secured a scooter trial for Colin which he found helpful, but despite her knowledge of the system, she says she has found it difficult to get all the necessary support even for herself. ""I have spent thousands on things like stair lifts and private care but still haven't got a ramp. If these things were given to us, or proper help given earlier, I think life would be a lot easier."" NHS Highland says it provides every MS patient with a specialist nurse to inform them about the support available and in Colin's case continues to work with him ""to provide support and advice"". Rona is surprised that, given Colin had gone public on his decision to end his life, no service had intervened or suggested he give other services a go. ""I just think it's very sad that this man went out to Switzerland not knowing the simple things,"" she says. Colin is more sanguine. He says when he visited the clinic in Basel, Switzerland, he had to pass six tests to ensure he was not vulnerable or being coerced. ""If I'd failed any of those stages they would have denied to provide the prescription that enabled assisted voluntary suicide,"" he says. ""You don't just think 'I'm going to kill myself'. If you decide to go to Switzerland, there's a lot of planning and it was a well-thought out decision."" However, he admits the clinic did not ensure he had exhausted every avenue of support available. Journalist Mik Scarlet, a member of Not Dead Yet UK, a group of disabled people who oppose assisted suicide, says implementing a safeguarding level would be essential if it was legalised in the UK. Paralysed at the age of 15, Mik tried to take his own life two years later. Mik Scarlet at an Ouch storytelling event ""I understand that fear and that black future,"" he says. ""A lot of it is lack of support, lack of knowledge, and Colin's story encapsulates why we're worried. ""You can't say you've made an informed decision if you don't know about scooters or care plans."" On Colin's initiative, he and Rona started to explore treatment options and Rona has travelled to Mexico to take part in stem cell research. The risky therapy involves wiping out the person's immune system with strong cancer drugs and then rebooting it with a stem cell transplant to stunt the progress of MS. In arecent study, out of the 281 people who had the treatment, nearly half benefited, but eight died shortly afterwards. Recovery can take as long as two years and it came with a Â£50,000 price tag which Rona had to crowdfund. While Rona recovers in Mexico from the treatment, Colin has settled into a new life and new ground-floor flat in Greenock, nearly 200 miles (322km) from Inverness. Despite the long-distance relocation, he says: ""It's great. I get all my meals and essentials done for me"". But his mind continues to return to winter and whether he wants to endure it again. ""It's not pleasant. With MS you're at high risk of a chest infection. You develop a cough which then becomes pneumonia and its the pneumonia that kills you. ""I was fully expecting that Thursday would be my final morning on planet earth. This is bonus time, but I'm realistic about it, my plans aren't cancelled.""

Those foreign fighters who do remain are likely to continue with IS as the group morphs into what it was in its early days, some 10 years ago: a lethal insurgent force using tactics ranging from terrorist attacks to guerrilla warfare. Foreign fighters have been over-represented among militants making last, desperate stands in thebattles of MosulandRaqqa. And many of them are now being tried in Iraqi courts, creating legal and moral dilemmas for many of their countries of origin, assome may face the death penalty.,external However, many other fighters have been leaving the ""caliphate"", mostly through the 822km (510 mile) long border between Turkey and Syria. While Turkish authorities have been patrolling with significantly more zeal than in the past, mountainous terrain and the presence of sophisticated smuggling networks mean the border is quite permeable. IS has a long-established support network throughout Turkey, which is playing a key role in extracting foreign fighters from Syria. Given the scores of attacks that have bloodied the country over the last three years, Turkish authorities are understandably concerned about this influx. Neighbouring countries, such as Jordan and Lebanon, have similar fears. The potential end destinations for foreign fighters leaving Syria and Iraq are plentiful. There is evidence that some have joined the official wilayat, or ""provinces"", IS has established inYemen, theSinai Peninsula,external, theNorth Caucasus,externalandEast Asia.,external The group also has a strong presence in Libya, where the US suggested last year that it hadup to 6,500 fighters,external, and several hundred in Afghanistan, where the US reportedkilling at least 94 fighters,externalin an attack on underground tunnels. Marawi in the Philippines has been partly held by fighters linked to IS since May There are also anecdotal indications of militants travelling to conflicts in far flung places such as theDemocratic Republic of Congo,external,Myanmar,externaland thePhilippines,external. The arrival of foreign fighters to these regions could strengthen the capabilities of local jihadist groups and change the course of sometimes devastating conflicts. Many other foreign fighters are choosing to return to their countries of origin. While some returnees may no longer engage in militant activities, others areestablishing clandestine networks,externalseeking to carry out attacks and, according to local circumstances, destabilise the country's political situation. North African countries are particularly vulnerable to the risk - nowhere more so than Tunisia, asabout 6,000 of its citizens left,externalto join IS - the highest per capita rate in the world. Arab Gulf countries may also suffer from this type of blowback. Russia, the Caucasus, and a number of Central Asian countries are also areas of concern, having seen large numbers join IS - many of whom went on to play a prominent role on the battlefield. European authorities consider the return of some of the estimated6,000 European foreign fighters,externala major security concern. To date, fewer than one in five individuals involved in attacks on the West since the ""caliphate"" was declared in 2014 had experience as foreign fighters, according to research by the Italian Institute for International Political Studies (ISPI) and the George Washington University's Program on Extremism. The Paris attacks were carried out in part by former foreign fighters Who was behind the jihadist attacks on the West? Who are Britain's jihadists? The archaeological treasures IS failed to destroy But this might change as the number of returnees - now estimated at roughly 1,000 -  increases. Many may show no sign of wishing to engage in further violent activities, but there is a valid concern that some may make use of their combat skills. It is plausible that they could use their network of contacts and ""celebrity status"" among unaffiliated jihad enthusiasts to plan terrorist attacks. The territorial losses suffered by IS are not likely to affect the operational ability of these largely independent militants. While significant problems still exist, European authorities have improved intelligence sharing to better detect returning fighters. And thanks to improved co-operation with Turkey, many militants have been arrested before they get any further. A few do manage to reach Europe illegally, or by posing as refugees - as some of theNovember 2015 Paris attackersdid. But most foreign fighters will come to Europe legally, often using their genuine European passports. If detecting them is a problem, working out what to do with them is equally fraught. Arresting them may be the obvious answer, but the reality is significantly more complicated. The UK Home Office, for example, disclosed last year that of the 400 British foreign fighters who had returned from Syria and Iraq,only 54 were convicted,external. Similar dynamics can be observed throughout the continent. Inside Raqqa after IS pushed out The city fit for no one Raqqa's loss seals rapid rise and fall What is preventing authorities from arresting, prosecuting and convicting returning foreign fighters? It is mostly a legal matter, with lawmakers struggling to keep up with a constantly shifting threat environment. While legislations vary from country to country, they share some common problems. In some countries, joining a terrorist organisation or fighting in a foreign conflict were not criminal offences at the time when most individuals travelled to Syria. Several countries have since introduced new laws which, however, cannot be applied retrospectively. Even in countries where such actions have long constituted criminal offences, authorities struggle to gather the evidence needed to build a strong criminal case. Knowing that somebody joined IS or committed atrocities in Syria from an intelligence perspective is one thing. Being able to prove that beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law is another. Even more complicated is the issue of children either born or raised in the ""caliphate"" by their foreign fighter parents. While most are not punishable under the law, they deserve attention because of the trauma they have suffered and, in some cases, because they present severe signs of radicalism despite their young age. The result is that authorities are overwhelmed, having to monitor hundreds of battle-hardened fighters, on top of the burgeoning number of home-grown IS sympathisers, in an attempt to determine which pose an immediate security threat. Instead, authorities throughout Europe have increasingly invested in programmes seeking to deradicalise returning foreign fighters. While it might be premature to definitively assess them, there are indications that some, like the one established in the Danish city of Aarhus -offering rehabilitation and inclusion in society,external, are effective. Others, like the French plan to set up 12deradicalisation centres,external, have been shelved. The loss of much of its territory is a major blow to ISIS. Yet the group and its adherents are already surfacing in various parts of the world and are likely to do so with even more frequency and vehemence in the near future. IS will become a more decentralised, amorphous organisation operating in a more asymmetric fashion, but it will not disappear. Moreover, the IS brand and the emotional appeal of its ""caliphate"" are unlikely to vanish any time soon. And, despite critical challenges, the organisation's remarkably strong digital presence, the so-called ""virtual caliphate"", will survive in some form, potentially rekindling the commitment of sympathisers worldwide and prompting some to carry out terrorist attacks in its name. The fall of the ""caliphate"" closes a chapter, but a new one is about to be opened.

Dolly Parton's nine-to-five approach to music,"Dolly Parton is known as much for her business acumen as her song-writing skills Even when she's talking about cold, hard cash, Dolly Parton manages to seem down to earth. She's promoting her new children's album ""I Believe in You"" and is in top, self-deprecating form,talking to the BBC. ""It's hard for me to spend money on tonnes of stuff because I'm going to look the same, no matter what I wear. If I wear diamonds I'm still going to look like a rhinestone,"" she tells me. Still, if Dolly was inclined to buy diamonds, she could afford them. She's known as much for her business acumen as her song-writing skills. At the start of her career she took lessons from her dad, she says: ""Even though he wasn't an educated man, he wasn't able to read and write, daddy had a great sense of business. Dolly Parton at Glastonbury - in the past year she's earned some $37m ""He said, 'Don't let other people take advantage of you, keep your mind on your business.' So when I got into the music business I thought of it as a business."" Early on she launched her own publishing company and hung on to the rights to her songs, and she says that other artists should do the same. ""As soon as you start making money, you should invest and get into other businesses that you can fall back on if you don't make it big, or if you make it big and you fall on hard times."" That attitude has served her well over the years and continues to do so, according to Forbes magazine's Celebrity 100 list. It claims Dolly earned $37m (Â£28m) in the year to June 2017, with most of this coming from her Pure and Simple concert tour and income from her Dollywood theme park in Tennessee. Dolly visits Vanderbilt children's hospital in Tennessee Brian Warner, founder of website CelebrityNetworth.com, estimates her total fortune to be $500m (Â£379m) but says this is conservative. ""We think that Dollywood alone is worth around $200m; $100m for the land itself and $100m for the brand - you could class it as an intangible asset. ""On top of that she makes a lot of money from touring and has had a 50-year career in which she's sold millions of records and has also written songs for other artists."" Mr Warner says ""I will always love you"", a hit Dolly wrote and recorded in 1973, has made her more than $20m in total. He explains that although individual music contracts may vary, ""as the writer of a song you might be keeping 50% of the revenue or more and as a writer and performer you could be getting 80%"". The Barnstormer ride at Dollywood Dolly's own version of ""I Will Always Love You"" was a big commercial success, topping the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart twice, in 1974 and 1982. Whitney Houston made the song a hit all over again when she recorded a version for the 1992 film The Bodyguard. It was number one for 10 weeks in the UK charts and for 14 weeks in the US. The song had another resurgence in 2012 after Ms Houston's death.

Set up in 1995 it aims to improve child literacy by distributing free books to children in the US, Canada, the UK and Australia. Dolly in London in 1977 Dolly says her own impoverished childhood in Tennessee inspired the library and has shaped her attitude to money in general. ""Being brought up poor means I don't take things for granted, and no matter how much money I make, I'll always count my blessings quicker and more often than I count my money. She has ""always realised the value of a dollar"", too. ""Even now if I go in a store it's hard for me to pay a huge amount of money for one item. I say 'good Lord', what could mummy and daddy have done with that!"" Dolly's Imagination Library scheme provides books for children At 71 years old, Dolly's career has spanned more than five decades and following her Glastonbury performance in 2014 she's reached a whole new audience. So what's the secret of her longevity? ""I think a lot of people can relate to me, because of my upbringing and because I'm from a big family. I think people see me as an aunt, an older sister or a cousin. I've been around so long I'm part of their family."" Dolly will be hoping that this loyal fan base will support ambitious plans to expand her empire. The DreamMore hotel at Dollywood, opened in 2015, is ""doing well"" and she is thinking of franchising it. She'd also like to do more kids projects and launch a line of wigs, cosmetics and clothes. ""I've still got a lot to do... I'm going to be an old lady before I get it done but at least I'm going to be working till I fall over dead!""

Stranded UK diver swims miles to safety,"This video can not be played A British man has told the BBC how he swam over four miles to safety after being ""followed"" by a tiger shark. A British diver says he swam 7.5km (4.5 miles) to safety off the coast of Australia after losing sight of his boat and being ""followed"" by a shark. John Craig, 34, had been spear-fishing underwater in Western Australia on Friday when he surfaced and could not see the boat, being crewed by a friend. Mr Craig said he noticed a shark as he called and splashed for help. He then began a long swim back to shore before reaching land and walking for another 30 minutes until he was seen. The Sunderland man, an experienced diver who moved to Australia two years ago, said the shark had appeared to be a tiger shark about 4m in length. ""It was extremely close and curious and kept approaching me from different angles. It was trying to work out what I was and whether I could be on the menu,"" he told the BBC. ""It was terrifying. I thought I was just going to be eaten out here in the middle of nowhere... this shark is just not leaving me alone."" Mr Craig said he placed his spear gun between himself and the shark as it swam around him in Shark Bay, about 800km north of Perth, the state capital. He then decided to swim towards the Francois Perron National Park after spotting a red cliff ""very low on the horizon"". But Mr Craig said he was followed by the ""curious"" shark for about 15 minutes. Surfer Mick Fanning in another shark scare How drones are protecting beachgoers The diver said he was thankful he was able to complete the swim ""At this point I thought I was gone - 4 nautical miles out to sea with a huge tiger shark following me - I thought this was it, this is how I am going to die,"" he said. ""I would look back and see its head come out of the gloom and at my fins, keeping pace with me."" He said he felt almost like the shark was ""escorting"" him to shore, but after a time it disappeared. Mr Craig estimated he swam for another three hours before reaching land, where he noticed an air and sea rescue effort was under way. Unable to gain anyone's attention, Mr Craig began walking towards a campsite until a plane spotted him about 30 minutes later. ""I could not believe that someone could swim that far in such a short period of time,"" said Glen Ridgley, from Shark Bay Volunteer Marine Rescue. ""I guess where there's a shark besides you spurring you on... it's like a trainer."" Mr Craig was reunited with his wife aboard one of the rescue boats. He has praised the quick response of the area's search and rescue authorities. His original boat had experienced mechanical issues but his friend was OK, Mr Craig said. Tiger sharks are responsible for the second-highest number of reported attacks on humans, according to theInternational Shark Attack File,external.

Japan PM promises to tackle North Korea,"Shinzo Abe called the snap election in September, and said the results were a ""vote of confidence"" Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has promised strong ""counter-measures"" against North Korea, after winning a decisive victory in Sunday's election. Mr Abe had called an early election for a greater mandate to deal with ""crises"", including the growing threat from Pyongyang, which has fired missiles over Japan in recent months. His ruling coalition has retained a two-thirds majority in parliament. This paves the way for Mr Abe to amend Japan's post-war pacifist constitution. The prime minister has previously called for the existence of the country's armed forces to be formalised, a controversial move which he says is needed to strengthen Japan's defence but which critics say is a step towards re-militarisation. Japan's snap election explained Country profile Speaking at a press conference in Tokyo, Mr Abe said his coalition's win was a ""vote of confidence"" from the public, and based on that ""we would dramatically show counter-measures against the North Korea threat"". He said he would discuss these measures with US President Donald Trump, who is visiting Japan next month, as well as with other world powers such as Russia and China. He said they would exert ""stronger pressure"" on North Korea, adding: ""I will make sure the Japanese public is safe, and safeguard our nation."" Mr Abe saw hispopularity plummet in recent monthswhile embroiled in political scandals, but enjoyed a sudden recovery after North Korea fired two missiles over the Japanese island of Hokkaido. The BBC's Rupert Wingfield-Hayes in Tokyo says Mr Abe's pledge of tough diplomacy with North Korea is rhetoric that would play well with the Japanese public, but it is unclear what it means in concrete terms. Tokyo has no diplomatic or economic relations with North Korea, and has poor relations with Pyongyang's closest ally China, so the most Mr Abe can do is strengthen Japan's defences and stick closely to the US, our correspondent adds. Turnout on Sunday was estimated at about 53.7% Mr Abe's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) coalition with the Komeito party has won 313 of the 465 seats in the lower house of Japan's parliamentary Diet - which gives them the power to table a revision to the constitution. Mr Abe had previously announced he wanted to revise a clause which renounces war, known as Article 9, to formally recognise Japan's military, which is known as the""self-defence forces"". He had set a deadline of 2020 to achieve this highly contentious task. But on Monday he appeared to ditch this target, saying it was ""not set in a concrete schedule"". He said he hoped to ""form a strong agreement"" on the issue among parties in parliament, and ""gain trust"" from the Japanese public. Even if an amendment to the constitution is passed and approved by both houses in the Diet - which Mr Abe's coalition controls - it still needs to be put to a public vote in a referendum. Mr Abe two years ago successfully managed to push for a re-interpretation of the constitution to allow troops to fight overseas under certain circumstances, whichattracted widespread protests. Toothless tiger: Japan Self-Defence Forces Our correspondent says Mr Abe's victory is also in large part due to the chaos of Japan's opposition parties. In the lead-up to the snap election, all eyes were on the recently-formed conservative Party of Hope led by the charismatic Tokyo governor Yuriko Koike, with some speculating that it would make significant gains. Ms Koike said she took responsibility for the result But in the end it was overtaken by the centre-left Constitutional Democratic Party which emerged as the biggest opposition party, and which opposes Mr Abe's plan to amend Article 9. Ms Koike, who was in Paris for a business trip during the election, told reporters she was personally taking responsibility for the result. Japanese media quoted her as saying her ""words and deeds"" had caused ""displeasure"" to voters. Mr Abe's election win also raises his chances of securing a third three-year-term as leader of the LDP when the party votes next September. That would give him the opportunity to become Japan's longest serving prime minister, having been elected in 2012. Japan's snap election explained Will the economy get Shinzo Abe re-elected?

Minimum alcohol price law to be unveiled,"A law to set a minimum price for selling alcohol in Wales has been unveiled. Ministers believe tackling excessive drinking could save a life a week and mean 1,400 fewer hospital admissions a year. Pricing is seen as a ""missing link"" in public health efforts, alongside better awareness and treatment. Under a 50p-a-unit formula, a typical can of cider would be at least Â£1 and a bottle of wine at least Â£4.69. A typical litre of vodka, for example, would have to cost more than Â£20. The Welsh Government has not yet decided what the price will be, however. This video can not be played A 30-second guide to how the minimum price for alcohol is worked out Alcohol experts from Sheffield University have studied the health picture, drinks market and consumption patterns in Wales. The research,externalhas helped produce a formula based on the percentage strength of the alcohol and its volume to develop the minimum unit price (MUP). While alcohol consumption levels have been falling in recent years, health officials are concerned that: Binge drinking is still a problem with young people; there is also an issue with the over-50s There were 463 alcohol-related deaths in Wales in 2015-16 There were 54,000 alcohol-related hospital admissions Cheap drink in supermarkets and other licensed stores is the main target and the law will also address the issue of special offers in its fine detail. Alcohol sold below 50p per unit makes up 72% of the beer sales in Welsh shops and supermarkets, 78% of the cider sales, 42% of the wine and 66% of the spirits. The research suggests that although high-risk drinkers make up only a quarter of people who drink alcohol, they drink 72% of all alcohol consumed and account for 65% of all spending. ""There is a very clear and direct link between levels of excessive drinking and the availability of cheap alcohol,"" said Public Health Minister Rebecca Evans. ""So we need to take decisive action now to address the affordability of alcohol, as part of wider efforts to tackle alcohol-related harm."" 'Decades' to reduce alcohol-related deaths Sporty people more likely to drink more alcohol Wales tops binge-drinking statistics It has been claimed it could: Save the NHS Â£6.5m a year by reducing the impact on hospitals Boost the Welsh economy by Â£44m a year by reducing workplace absence and crime. Researchers said 42% of the alcohol bought by high-risk drinkers in poverty is of the cheaper variety - against 21% for moderate drinkers in poverty. But officials believe more affluent high-risk drinkers will also respond to price changes and they insisted it was not a tax but a tool to change behaviour. Chief Medical Officer Dr Frank Atherton said they were not the ""fun police"" or the ""nanny state"" but they could not wash their hands of a significant public health issue. ""It will have a small impact on moderate drinkers,"" he added. ""The most substantial effects will be experienced by harmful and hazardous drinkers, who are more likely to consume cheaper and higher-strength alcohol products."" This video can not be played Alex Loveland, who supports people with alcohol problems, said they might be put under strain But Alex Loveland, a recovering alcoholic who supports people with dependency, is worried that it will not help them. ""They're going to try to get alcohol by any means necessary and I think it will put more strain on very underprivileged people,"" he said. The Welsh Retail Consortium has also expressed concern that minimum price may hit less affluent, moderate consumers of alcohol ""whilst not necessarily having the desired impact on problem drinkers"". UKIP Wales leader Neil Hamilton AM said it was another example of the Welsh Government ""sticking its nose into people's private lives"". ""The problem is not alcohol but anti-social behaviour,"" he said. ""The laws on public drunkenness need to be strictly enforced, as they used to be."" But Prof Mark Bellis, director of policy at Public Health Wales, said it would reduce opportunities for young people to buy alcohol ""at pocket money prices"". Dr David Bailey, chair of the BMA's Welsh Council said it was behind measures ""to ensure that alcohol cannot be sold below cost - in effect, making it cheaper than water to purchase"". Addictions charity Cais said although the law would not solve alcohol problems on its own it was an ""important day for Wales"" and stressed that it would save lives. This video can not be played Rebecca Evans emphasised that it was not a tax but would be tackle problem drinking The legislation is back on the table five years after the Welsh Government first looked at introducing it. The measure had been removed from the most recent Welsh public health law as Scotland faced court challenges to its own legislation. The Supreme Court is expected to give its judgement within weeks to anattempt to block Scotland's minimum price legislationfrom being introduced. Ms Evans told BBC Radio Wales that the Welsh Government had moved ""quickly"" to introduce its own legislation because the powers to do so will beremoved next April under the terms of the 2017 Wales Act. ""If we are going to act on this area it has to be now, even though we realise that there's a difficult legal context that we are working in,"" she said. This video can not be played Ian Hunt of Filco Supermarkets says it could be seen as a charge on the poor Ministers in Wales hope it will become law by summer 2018. Councils would enforce the legislation through their existing inspection and trading standards regime - with powers of entry, prosecution and the issue of fixed penalty notices. Talks have been held with local government about funding towards its initial introduction.

CO2 rise 'will affect all sea life',"Cold water corals should be more resilient All sea life will be affected because carbon dioxide emissions from modern society are making the oceans more acidic, a major new report will say. The eight-year study from more than 250 scientists finds that infant sea creatures will be especially harmed. This means the number of baby cod growing to adulthood couldfall to a quarter or even a 12th of today's numbers,external, the researchers suggest. The assessment comes from theBIOACID project,external, which is led from Germany. A brochure summarising the main outcomes will be presented to climate negotiators at their annual meeting, which this year is taking place in Bonn in November. The Biological Impacts of Ocean Acidification report authors say some creatures may benefit directly from the chemical changes - but even these could still be adversely affected indirectly by shifts in the whole food web. What is more, the research shows that changes through acidification will be made worse by climate change, pollution, coastal development, over-fishing and agricultural fertilisers. Ocean acidification is happening because as CO2 from fossil fuels dissolves in seawater, it produces carbonic acid and this lowers the pH of the water. Mesocosms (""giant test tubes"") allow scientists to study acidification effects on real-world organisms Since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, the average pH of global ocean surface waters have fallen from pH 8.2 to 8.1. This represents an increase in acidity of about 26%. The study's lead author is Prof Ulf Riebesell from the GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research in Kiel. He is a world authority on the topic and has typically communicated cautiously about the effects of acidification. He told BBC News: ""Acidification affects marine life across all groups, although to different degrees. ""Warm-water corals are generally more sensitive than cold-water corals. Clams and snails are more sensitive than crustaceans. ""And we found that early life stages are generally more affected than adult organisms. ""But even if an organism isn't directly harmed by acidification it may be affected indirectly through changes in its habitat or changes in the food web. ""At the end of the day, these changes will affect the many services the ocean provides to us."" Since 2009, scientists working under the BIOACID programme have studied how marine creatures are affected by acidification during different life stages; how these reactions reverberate through the marine food web; and whether the challenges can be mitigated by evolutionary adaptation. Some research was done in the lab but other studies were conducted in the North Sea, the Baltic, the Arctic, and Papua New Guinea. A synthesis of more than 350 publications on the effects of ocean acidification - which will be given to climate delegates at next month's  summit - reveals that almost half of the marine animal species tested reacted negatively to already moderate increases in seawater CO2 concentrations. Early life stages were affected in Atlantic cod, blue mussels, starfish, sea urchins and sea butterflies. But an experiment with barnacles showed they were not sensitive to acidification. And some plants - like algae which use carbon for photosynthesis - may even benefit. Organisms that use calcium carbonate to build their bodies will likely struggle Dr Carol Turley, an ocean acidification expert from Plymouth Marine Labs in the UK described the BIOACID research as enormously important. She told BBC News: ""It's contributed enormous insights into the impacts that acidification can have on a wide range of marine organisms from microbes to fish. ""It's also explored how in combination with ocean warming and other stressors it might play out at the ecosystem level and affect human society. ""On the lead-up to the UN climate change negotiations in Bonn this November it is clear that the ocean and its ecosystems should not be ignored."" The conference is being held in Germany but it is being chaired by Fiji, which wants delegates to give due prominence to the effects of CO2 on the ocean.
