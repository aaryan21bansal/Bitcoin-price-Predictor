Greatest gift,"""It takes a special kind of person"" to donate their kidney, Andy said of his friend Helen About 3,000 people have kidney transplants each year in the UK and about a third of these are from living donors. Helen Crowther has given one of her kidneys to her best friend Andy Clewes. He has suffered with chronic kidney disease since birth and has recently started to need dialysis treatment. When Helen first offered Andy her kidney he laughed along, thinking it was a joke. ""But she really meant it and as I got worse she became more insistent until about 12 months ago she said 'right, I definitely want to do it',"" he said. Helen's kidney was removed at the Royal Liverpool Hospital on Tuesday morning. Helen said it ""feels like a privilege"" to be able to give her kidney to her best friend It was then ""whisked down the M62"" to Andy in the Manchester Royal Infirmary. ""The last 12 months have gone so slowly and to finally get to this end point is fantastic,"" the 46-year-old said. ""I was just on the cusp of dialysis, feeling exhausted all the time and unable to concentrate in work - now I can't wait to get my life back. I'm really excited."" Andy, a radio DJ in Macclesfield, said: ""I'm incredibly lucky and grateful. It's hard to put into words such a massive thing... it takes a special kind of person to do this."" The pair are hoping to encourage others to sign up to the organ donor register Born a week apart, the pair struck up their friendship in 2006 after meeting at a charity fundraising event. Last year Helen, 46, was Andy's ""best woman"" at his wedding. Helen, a charity worker from Runcorn, said she thought donating a kidney was ""the obvious thing to do"". ""I do appreciate it's a huge thing. I just didn't want to see Andy poorly. I was aware you can live well with one kidney so couldn't see why you wouldn't do it."" Helen's kidney was removed at the Royal Liverpool Hospital When Andy's mum met Helen for the first time at his wedding and thanked her, she ""was in tears"". ""It's a bit embarrassing when people are saying you're so brave,"" she said. ""His family were so lovely at the wedding and I was overwhelmed really. I was just doing it as Andy needed to get well. I had the ability to help him. ""It feels like a privilege. I am just so grateful I can do it."" For Andy, he is planning on getting back to a normal life. ""I've been restricted physically up to now but the doctors say I'll get a burst of energy. ""I'm going to want to go off on holiday... to do everything. I think I'm going to be quite annoying."" He said it had made him very aware that others ""aren't so fortunate and rely on the kindness of strangers"" so he hopes his experience will encourage people to become organ donors as they ""really will be changing lives"". Kidneys filter waste products from the blood and convert them to urine. These waste products can build up in people whose kidneys fail, which is potentially life-threatening and the reason a transplant is needed. Kidneys are the most common organ donated by a living person and a healthy person can lead a normal life with one working kidney. Before 2006, living kidney donation was limited to exchanges between family members and friends but since the UK allowed ""non-directed altruistic donation"" by strangers, more than 500 people have gone ahead with the operation. There were 1,035 living kidney donor transplants performed in the UK in 2015/2016 - but as of September 2016, there are 5,338 people waiting for a kidney. You can find more information on theNHS Organ Donation website,external. Andy said the friends were ""always there for each other"" ""Nobody wants to see anyone they love on dialysis,"" said Helen. ""This should improve his quality of life. He'll be healthier and that's all I want."" ""It's just a couple of months out of my life when I'll feel a bit tired and sore, but for Andy it will be a whole new life."" Andy said: ""It's a totally selfless act and she's got a friend for life whether she wants it or not.""

Song and dance,"Warning: This story contains spoilers. Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone star in La La Land ""Incredible!"" ""Glorious!"" ""Magnificent!"" - The hype surrounding La La Land has been difficult to miss. In addition to all the critical praise, the film is dominating awards season - equalling the all-time record held by Titanic and All About Eve for themost Oscar nominations. But now many moviegoers are coming forward to say - or rather whisper - that they just didn't get it. I was one such moviegoer who was desperate to see it - but left feeling somewhat disappointed. La La Land's posters have made much of the rave reviews I'm keen to stress I don't think La La Land is a bad movie. Far from it - the songs are catchy and it's beautifully filmed. But after the acres of five-star reviews, I came away feeling it had been somewhat overhyped. Judging by our inbox after the Oscar nominations on Tuesday - there are other film fans who felt the same way. La La Land: Your views ""I could not agree more with those who criticised La La Land - absolutely dreadful film. The direction was immature and the film lacked any pace, leaving aside the fairly abysmal singing and dancing."" - Leslie ""Somehow, I think the critics and the Academy members have been in La La Land. Saw it Sunday and although I didn't hate it I just can't see what all the fuss is about."" - Graham ""Very weak storyline. Music and singing not on a par with any of the great musicals. Just wanted it to end! When will the critics actually be honest about a film? Five star this, five star that... it would barely get a two in my opinion."" - Nigel It's not unusual for the films which float around during awards season to be popular with critics, but less so with the general public. Indeed, there is a school of thoughtpopular with marketing researchers,externalthat it is actively necessary for a film to split opinion in order for it to be successful. Oscar Wilde certainly believed that, famously stating: ""There is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about, and that is not being talked about."" Titanic seemed to prove this theory - despite having an effect on audiences similar to Marmite, it went on to become the highest-grossing film of all time (since beaten by Avatar) and scooped the Oscar for best picture in 1997. La La Land has picked up 14 Oscar nominations The last musical to win best picture was 2002's Chicago - starring Catherine Zeta-Jones and Renee Zellweger. I distinctly remember going to see it at the cinema and being bowled over by how good it was. The acting, the editing and the songs all blended together to make an almost-perfect film. The subsequent success of movies such as Mamma Mia and Pitch Perfect prove that audiences are more than willing to go and see musicals on the big screen. But while those films are fairly mainstream, feel-good box office fodder, La La Land has been criticised for not quite delivering what it advertises. In the film's ubiquitous promotional image, Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are seen dancing together against a purple skyline. The vibrant colours make it look young, appealing, glamorous. Many of the film's reviews reinforce its image as a Hollywood love story. ""A gorgeously romantic modern-day musical"" is howthe i paper,externaldescribed it. But the film is actually far from romantic - lacking the traditional happy ending which would've seen Gosling and Stone's characters end up together. Personally I thought not being predictable is actually one of La La Land's best qualities, I was pleasantly surprised that its ending took an unexpected route. My issue was more that it simply didn't quite live up to the months of build-up and promotion and subsequent awards success - it has already broken the record for the mostGolden Globe Awardsin history. The film has been roundly praised by critics Of course, a bit of a backlash is inevitable for any pop culture product once its success has gone stratospheric. It is always difficult for any film, album, book or TV show to live up to expectations once it's been so highly praised. If I had gone into the cinema with no expectations, I probably would have come away from it with a better opinion than I did having gone in with such high expectations. When I saw Chicago, I was 15 years old and paid no attention to reviews or hype - and I enjoyed the film so much more as a result. Some film fans have taken issue with the fact that a movie about jazz is fronted by two white actors, while others say the script is weak and that Gosling and Stone's singing talents are questionable. The Spectator,external's Deborah Ross - one of the few critics to strike a slightly more dissenting note - said the songs had ""lyrics I couldn't make out for the life of me"" - but, as she and most other critics agree, the songs themselves are impossibly catchy. It would be hard to argue La La Land is a bad film - it just doesn't quite do what it says on the tin. My advice to those who haven't seen it would be to ignore the reviews, go in with a clear mind and just enjoy it as a perfectly nice but unspectacular film.

Volunteers sign up to cuddle babies,"Vulnerable babies born addicted to painkillers or heroin are being soothed through their first difficult weeks by volunteers whose sole task is simply to cuddle them. Programmes in hospitals and care facilities across the US have been inundated by people keen to offer physical comfort to the infants as they go through the withdrawal process. Numerous studies have shown the benefits of human physical contact, and medical staff have found that recruiting volunteers to hold and snuggle up to babies - perhaps singing or whispering to them - has a positive effect on the newborns. Many babies spend weeks or months in hospital as they are gradually weaned off the drugs they have been exposed to in their mothers' wombs. Sometimes they are not with their parents, or their mothers are spending many hours each day attending drug rehabilitation programmes. ""These babies need to feel love, human touch and a soft voice to comfort them when they're in pain,"" says Maryann Malloy, a nurse manager for the neonatal intensive care unit at Einstein Medical Center in Philadelphia. ""It makes the parents feel better knowing that even when they cannot be here there is someone to rock and hold their baby."" ""It is a helpless feeling when these babies become inconsolable. ""Our cuddlers help so the babies do not reach that point. They pick them up before the first whimper."" The babies are suffering from Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS) as a result of their mothers using prescription painkillers and drugs like heroin or methadone. Their symptoms will vary depending on what drugs the mother was taking but can include excessive crying, fever, irritability, rapid breathing, seizures, sleep problems, trembling, vomiting and sweating. Having volunteers available to cuddle babies also has reduces both the amount of medication babies need and their length of stay in baby units, doctors have noted. Some babies have also shown other improvements, such as gaining weight more quickly. Recruiting cuddlers to help look after vulnerable infants is now a widespread practice in the US. It has been used by some institutions dating back to the 1980s for premature babies and those born to crack-addicted mothers. However, the problem of babies born with NAS in the USappears to be growing,external. A 2013 report showed a greater number of women were using prescribed painkillers during pregnancy and also a general increase in prescription painkiller abuse. According to theNational Institute on Drug Abuse,externalone baby every 25 minutes is born with NAS. ThePennsylvania Health Care Cost Containment Council reported,externalthat in its region alone the rate of newborn hospital stays for substance-abuse problems soared 250 percent from 2000 to 2015, when almost 20 out of every 1,000 newborns faced withdrawal issues. Similar volunteer programmes are run across the US. The Thomas Jefferson University Hospital, in Philadelphia, has a four-hour training course for its cuddlers. Once vetted and trained the volunteers put in three-hour supervised shifts. The Boston Medical Center also has a program called CALM - Cuddling Assists in Lowering Maternal and Infant Stress. So many people have signed up to the Jefferson cuddling programme that their books are closed now to new volunteers until the middle of the year. Those still keen to help are advised to look up local women and children's shelters, which often provide services for mothers battling addiction.

Man cycles 500km in wrong direction,"The man (not pictured) was stopped by police after cycling for 30 days A man hoping to cycle home cross-country for Chinese New Year realised 30 days into his trip that he had been travelling in the wrong direction. The young migrant worker from China was aiming for his home in Qiqihar, Heilongjiang province, after setting off from Rizhao - over 1,700km away. But he was stopped by traffic police 500km off course, in the central Chinese province of Anhui. When they found out, the police paid for a train ticket to get him home. The man had set off from Rizhao, in Shandong province, in December. A report fromthe People's Online Daily,externalsaid the man had been living in internet cafes and was low on funds. But he was determined to make it home so he chose to cycle the route. The unnamed man could not read maps, meaning he had to rely on others for directions. Police stopped him when he was riding on a highway, which cannot be used by cyclists. After discovering his mistake, both police and people working at the toll station he was stopped at contributed to his ticket home.

Did millions vote illegally in the US?,"The claim:Donald Trump would have won the popular vote in last year's US presidential election had it not been for people voting illegally. Reality Check verdict:There is no evidence to support the assertion that at least 2.86 million people voted illegally. White House press secretary Sean Spicer confirmed on Tuesday that President Donald Trump stands by his concerns about illegal voting. The disclosure came after the president was reported to have claimed in a closed meeting on Monday that between three and five million unauthorised immigrants had voted for Hillary Clinton. At the end of November, Mr Trump tweeted: ""I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally."" While the president won the election viathe electoral college, he actually received 2.86 million fewer votes than his rival. So his suggestion is that at least 2% of the people who voted did so illegally, assuming that they all voted for Mrs Clinton. Non-citizens of the United States, including permanent legal residents, do not have the right to vote in presidential elections. Voter registration requires applicants to declare their citizenship status, and they could face criminal punishment if they falsely claim citizenship rights. In addition to being registered voters, in two-thirds of states, voters are required to bring identification to the polls in order to be allowed to vote. In all states, first-time voters who register to vote by post must providevalid identification before voting.,external Donald Trump and his team have referred to two studies they say show the threat posed by unauthorised voting; both have been challenged. A 2014 study published in Electoral Studies found evidence that suggested non-citizens do vote and ""can change the outcome of close races"". Donald Trump referred to this study on the campaign trail in Wisconsin on 17 October. The research has been roundly criticised by political scientists who said it misinterpreted the data. The team behind the research used data collected by the Cooperative Congressional Election Study (CCES), which is a national survey taken before and after elections. The CCESpublished a newsletter,externalthat disputed the findings and said ""the likely percent of non-citizen voters in recent US elections is 0"". During the campaign, Mr Trump also referred to a 2012Pew Center on the States study,externalthat found 1.8 million dead Americans were still registered. The deceased, alleged Mr Trump, were still voting. The report, however, does not make any statements about this claim. Although it is not impossible for non-citizens to break voting laws, there is no evidence that millions of immigrants without the right to vote influenced the outcome of the popular vote. Election officials, including those from the Republican Party, have said there was no evidence of mass electoral fraud and senior Republicans such as House Speaker Paul Ryan have distanced themselves from the claim. But President Trump tweeted from his personal account on Wednesday to say that he would be asking for a major investigation into voter fraud.

The most influential woman in fashion?,"Shulman said it was 'difficult to decide to leave' the magazine The fashion world has been paying tribute to British Vogue editor Alexandra Shulman as she steps down from the industry bible after a quarter of a century. When she was appointed on 23 January 1992, Nicholas Coleridge - the then managing director of Vogue - said""Vogue is almost in her blood"",external, referring to the fact her mother, father and brother had all worked at the publication. So how will her tenure be remembered and why was she such a great ambassador for the fashion world? We asked industry figures for their views. ""Her contribution has been amazing, she had some fantastic covers. She has a love for fashion, but never in a precious way. ""I worked with her on the Sunday Telegraph many years ago, and she wasn't your expected type of fashionista. She wasn't like [US Vogue editor] Anna Wintour - she was her own person. ""She has her own style, slightly bohemian, and had a sense of humour. She was funny. She was really committed to her job and she loved Vogue."" - Hilary Alexander, editor-at- large of Hello! Fashion Monthly and former fashion director of the Daily Telegraph Alexandra Shulman championed supermodels like Naomi Campbell ""There are many stylists out there and people who have a wonderful take on fashion but few have such a good eye for a story as Alex has. ""She was one of the first people to realise, years back, that supermodels were becoming stars in their own right. She championed the Naomis and the Kates [Naomi Campbell and Kate Moss]. ""To this day, Kate Moss has still appeared on the cover more than anyone else. It was Alex who recognised the story, as much as others recognised the fashion."" - Robert Johnson, GQ fashion director ""She supported British fashion massively. She believed in it as almost a brand in itself and she stuck up for it all the time. As editor, I think she saw it grow in stature. ""The British fashion industry has become a bit more respected for being viable and less thought of as 'the crazy place', and actually acknowledged that it is a very creative place. She supported both sides of it."" - Alison Lloyd, the founder of accessories brand Ally Capellino Alexandra Shulman played a crucial role in the Vogue 100: A Century of Style exhibition ""Alexandra Shulman is an exceptional editor and has been an instrumental ambassador to British fashion internationally. ""During her 25-year tenure at British Vogue, the magazine has evolved into one of the leading fashion publications in the world, bringing the fashion industry ever closer to the reader. ""The British Fashion Council are so grateful for the support Alex has given to our young designers through initiatives like the BFC/Vogue Designer Fashion Fund, steered by her eye for the best designers and creative influencers."" - Caroline Rush, chief executive of the British Fashion Council Kate Moss has appeared on the cover 37 times ""Alex Shulman is one of the great editors of her time. ""Magazines are driven to a large extent by the nature of their character, and Vogue's character for the last 25 years has been defined by Alex's intelligence, surface smarts, elegance, as well as by a genuine sense of respect. ""Vogue is a big brand, maybe the biggest magazine brand of them all, and she has been a great gatekeeper, keeping all reductive forces at bay."" - Dylan Jones, editor of GQ ""She was interested in promoting a broader range of beauty and body image. ""I wrote to her in the very early days when she published a set of pictures of a curvaceous model in the late 1990s. I said I'd be interested in the response, and she understood where I was coming from and wanted to talk about it. ""[Fashion designer] Amanda Wakeley and I approached her at the beginning of setting up Fashion Targets Breast Cancer in 1996 and she really saw the value of it and helped us create two big fashion industry photos. ""She could see the bigger picture and wanted to broaden what fashion could do.

London's dirty air: How bad is it?,"London has suffered a ""very high"" episode of air pollution thanks to emissions from cars and stoves in cold, windless conditions The cold, calm weather of the past few days has seen London and the South East experience very high levels of air pollution. Emissions from cars and wood burning stoves have seen levels of particulate matter soar to their highest concentrations since 2011. We look at how scientists assess the scale of dirty air across the UK and the long term trends. And just how dangerous is the air that we breathe? There are air quality monitors dotted all across the UK - The major, government-run national network is called theAutomatic Urban and Rural Network,external(AURN). Under the control of the Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, (Defra) it consists of 133 stations that automatically monitor a wide variety of pollution measures. Local authorities also run networks of monitoring stations across the UK. In the capital, a key monitoring and forecasting network which works alongside local councils isLondon Air,external, run by King's College London. The scientists at King's monitor pollution from over 100 measuring stations, in parks, back gardens and alongside major roads. Observers believe that when it comes to the more accurate forecasting of conditions in London, the King's network is more ""on the spot"" than the national system. ""If you look at the forecast that Defra put out for Tuesday, they were only expecting a few patches of moderate level pollution across the country,"" said Andrea Lee, fromClient Earth,external, which has brought a number of court cases on the question of air pollution. ""This morning that had been revised and upped to 'high', but they are not picking up the very high levels that are being measured in London and in places like Norwich."" The government air quality forecasts are produced by the Met Office, using a 1km x 1km grid system that some experts argue doesn't give you the spatial accuracy that's needed. Protestors in London highlight the health impact of poor air quality Those who run the King's College network believe the differences come from the fact that many of their monitoring stations are focused on problem areas such as big roads. ""The forecasts are done from different perspectives,"" said Dr Gary Fuller from King's College London. ""The Met Office air pollution is forecasting air pollution very much in the way it forecasts the weather, it is intensely model-based. We are coming from the opposite end with less use of modelling and much more use of measurement."" The current air pollution episode in London and the South East differs from the norm in the sense that the pollution mainly consists of high levels of particulate matter (PM). These tiny particles are coming from traffic and the burning of wood, while the windless weather means they have concentrated at high levels in several parts of the city. While this is a short term problem that occurs in many other cities, where London and the UK fall down more often is on the question of nitrogen dioxide, (NO2), produced mainly by diesel cars. In fact, so great are concentrations of NO2 in London that by January 5,Brixtonhad already exceeded the EU permitted amount for the whole year. The UK has one of the highest rates of deaths linked to NO2, according to research from theEuropean Environment Agency,externalpublished last year. The reason the UK is consistently in trouble on NO2 is because the government and the EU adopted the recommendations of the World Health Organization (WHO) on the safe level of exposure. Some argue these should be further tightened - and the WHO is starting to review the guidelines. When it came to particulate matter, the government didn't accept the WHO guidance, and set higher levels which the UK consistently comes in under. But there is concern that many health problems linked to exposure to particulate matter may well be missed since the UK is consistently below EU levels. ""We literally took the WHO evidence for NO2 and hence we have huge compliance problems,"" said Dr Fuller. The UK has ongoing problems of dirty air made worse by emissions from diesel cars ""But we didn't take them for PM2.5 and PM10. Even though we are meeting legal limits for these pollutants, they are causing a huge health burden - an estimated 29,000 early deaths each year in the UK. This illustrates the fact that our standards are relaxed compared to [those of the] WHO."" Comparisons to other countries are difficult to make. Western European countries are more likely to have air pollution that comes from cars, while in Eastern Europe and other regions, the pollution comes from the use of different fuels. ""People see images from China and India and say our pollution is nothing like that,"" said Andrea Lee from Client Earth. ""But the problem is that they are suffering from coal pollution which is very bad but very visible. The most you could probably notice is a bit of brown tinge over London, otherwise it's so hard to see that most people are unaware of the harm that's being caused."" Experts believe that the UK's location on the western fringe of Europe is a major asset when it comes to eliminating air pollution, especially with particulate matter. ""We do better on PM than many of the other European cities,"" said Dr Fuller. ""We sit on the edge and normally the winds blow off the Atlantic so when it comes to the fresh air we are first in line, but when the air gets to Poland it's passed over many kilometres of pollution sources."" The absence of a breeze has made the current episode much worse but those in the field believe that focusing too much on the weather obscures the real problem. Huge progress has been made in eliminating many air pollutants over the past 30 years. But efforts to limit and reduce NO2 have proved increasingly difficult. ""If you look at NO2, we set limits in 1999 to be met by 2010. Here we are in 2017 with levels in places [that are] two or three times the legal limit,"" said Dr Fuller. ""It's not really a success story."" Others say there is little doubt as to the cause of this persistent problem. It has been caused by the decision to encourage the purchase of diesel cars to reduce emissions of CO2 taken back in 2001. ""The fact that it has happened here in the UK is a serious indictment of the UK government,"" said Dr Jo Barnes from the University of the West of England. ""The fact is that we really haven't taken air pollution as seriously as necessary to do something about it. There's more pressure on the government now, but whether they are actually doing anything is another matter.""

Trumping trade,"Mr Trump insisted leaving the TPP was good for American workers Free trade and globalisation had a bad 2016, but it looks like 2017 could be even worse. For decades there has been a consensus that globalisation brought more jobs, higher wages and lower prices - not just for richer countries but also for developing and poorer nations. But there is now a growing movement of anger as people see jobs being taken by machines, old industries disappearing and waves of migration disturbing the established order. Global trade flows are falling and trade deals are being ripped up. The new US President Donald Trump has threatened to impose tariffs of up to 45% on Chinese goods, accusing the country of economically ""raping"" the US. One of China's fiercest critics, Peter Navarro, has been appointed as a top trade advisor. A Japanese factory's Donald Trump masks are in demand, but the US exit from the TPP agreement will hit trade between the two countries An executive order pulling out of the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership(TPP) agreement aimed at deepening economic ties between the twelve countries that border the Pacific Ocean was one of Mr Trump's first acts on moving into the White House. The future of free trade is looking very gloomy. But what's behind the anger that threatens decades of relative global consensus on globalisation? The sense of grievance in the US is clear: the manufacturing sector in the country has seen six million jobs disappear between 1999 and 2011, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Studies have shown that the decline in the US has been mirrored by gains in China. Automation has helped drive the decline in US manufacturing jobs But Chinese imports only explain 44% of the decline in employment in manufacturing in the US between 1990 and 2007, according to a report by the Institute for the Study of Labor in Bonn. Part of the decline has been down to the outsourcing of jobs to other countries but automation and more efficient processes have also taken their toll. ""All countries end up with losers from technological development - whether it is telephone operators or bank tellers,"" says Gary Hufbauer, a trade expert from the Peterson Institute for International Economics. ""The problem in the US is that we don't do much to help those people who lose out through social security support or job retraining,"" says Mr Hufbauer. The anger that flows from this has found a home in the protectionist rhetoric of politicians like Mr Trump. ""There has been no growth in household income during the last decade in Europe, the US and Japan. People are not happy and if you have to blame someone, it is easy to blame foreigners,""' says Mr Hufbauer. The rise of political opposition to globalisation has coincided with - and contributed to - a period of declining world trade growth since the financial crisis of 2008. Between 1986 and 2008 world trade grew at an average of 6.5%, according to the World Trade Organization. Between 2012 and 2015 that rate has slowed to an average of 3.2% and is predicted to expand by just 1.7% in 2016. That slowdown would make it the longest period of relative trade stagnation since the Second World War. Since the financial crisis the slowing of the Chinese economy and political and economic stagnation in the eurozone have contributed to this flat-lining of world trade. At the same time, in an attempt to insulate companies and industries at home, politicians have turned to tariffs and restrictions on imports from other countries. ""Governments worldwide have almost doubled their resort to trade distortions in the last two years,"" says Prof Simon Evenett, a trade expert at St Gallen University. ""The recent surge in 'beggar-thy-neighbour' activity predates Trump and Brexit, suggesting that populist pressures are likely to exacerbate protectionism,"" he says. The flat lining of economic growth has increased pressure on politicians. ""Governments across the world are enacting protectionist policies often masquerading as 'industrial policy,"" according to Prof Evenett. He says this often involves offering government subsidies to local companies, introducing import barriers and new '""local"" standards for products from abroad. Yet while protectionism may seem appealing to politicians assailed by angry workers, they often only end up raising prices for consumers. For example, there was an outcry in 2012 when cheap Chinese tyres flooded into the US market, putting the viability of the domestic producers in question. President Obama responded with punitive tariffs to get China ""to play by the rules"". The protectionist measures were well received in the US, but a study by the Peterson Institute established that the tariffs meant US consumers paid $1.1bn more for their tyres in 2011. Each job that was saved effectively cost $900,000 with very little of that reaching the pockets of the workers. With the economic and social benefits of free trade coming increasingly under attack, proponents of globalisation have tried to launch a counterattack. For example, The World Bank recently published a study of developing countries showing that average incomes for people living in the bottom 40% increased between 2008 and 2013, despite the impact of the financial crisis. ""There is a realisation in rich countries and among rich elites that there are problems with globalisation,"" says Branko Milanovic, an economist whose work on income inequality has driven much of the debate. ""They realise that for their own political self-preservation they have to tackle them."" But the solutions are not obvious, nor easy to implement. ""Most of the benefits of globalisation have been enjoyed by a relatively small group within each country. ""The question is not whether there are benefits to globalisation - there clearly are. But the question is about who is enjoying those benefits,"" says Andrew Lang from the London School of Economics. Part of the anger might dissipate if economic growth was to stop its stubborn flat-lining trajectory, lifting incomes around the world. Many in the US, Europe and Japan have seen no increase in their household income in the past 10 years ""To help solve these problems you need to get the world economy revved up. Governments need to commit to fiscal stimulus to get their economies going again,"" says Gary Hufbauer. Branko Milanovic points to the success of previous politicians in turning round seemingly intractably weak economies. ""It's not impossible for politicians to address these issues. ""Thatcher and Reagan managed to effect change in relatively short periods of time - a presidential term of four years should be enough to start making a difference,"" he says. But Prof Evenett is pessimistic: ""I expect the global plateau in world trade to continue in 2017 and that is before Donald Trump enacts any of the protectionist measures he has threatened.""

Russia's first president,"This video can not be played Boris Yeltsin came to international attention as the Russian leader who took control of the country after the collapse of the Soviet Union. He ushered in a period of great change promising to turn the Soviet Union into a market economy and Russia into a democracy. While he delivered a sort of democracy during his time in power, the period was marked by economic collapse as well as confrontation with the vestiges of the Communist Party. It also led to the controversial transfer of huge state wealth to a small coterie of businessmen, Russia's powerful oligarchs.

Painful sex,"One in 10 women in Britain finds sex painful says alarge studyof more than 7,000 women. The reasons vary from physical issues to anxiety. We spoke to four women who have experienced painful sex. Natasha Kilby, aged 34, had experienced pain during sex throughout her long-term relationship with her partner but after receiving treatment they got married in December 2016. ""The problem started at university. Every time I thought about having sex, I felt horrible and I didn't want him to touch me. ""Eventually I was diagnosed with a very rare form of thrush, but by that point, the pain had created psychological barriers. ""The only way I could have sex was by getting really drunk or I'd force myself to do it, which upset my partner. ""I felt like I wasn't in a real relationship. For some time we only had sex once a year. ""I didn't want to get married until we solved the problem because I didn't feel like I could be a proper wife - our 'sex' life consisted of a peck on the cheek. ""I began to receive counselling, which worked and now our relationship is improving. ""The thought of having a baby used to be impossible but now we are in a much better place."" Hannah Bradley, aged 19, has always experienced pain during sex. ""Sex has been painful since I first had sex three years ago. ""I went to the doctor who suggested that I change contraceptive, then I was treated with dilation for vaginismus and later I had a procedure to cauterise my cervix, but these did not solve the problem. ""I had psychosexual therapy for two months, but I believe that the problem is physical not emotional. ""Now they think I might have vaginal scarring and tightening after untreatedlichen sclerosus,external. ""I found it very difficult that I could not have sex. I felt really left out of conversations with my friends, and like I could not understand their lives. ""I only felt pain and I was jealous of their experience. ""It makes me feel different. Most people my age have an active sex life and I cannot have that. ""It still upsets me. My partner is understanding but it is upsetting for him too. I want to have sex but I physically cannot. ""I hope that it will improve soon, but no-one knows what is wrong. I'm still young and sex should be part of my life"" ""Sarah"" says painful sex made her feel anxious and depressed Sarah (not her real name), aged 20, cannot have sex without extreme pain, which led to the breakdown of her relationship with her boyfriend. ""Sex became gradually more painful to the point where it was just impossible - my vagina would literally close up and not allow anything in without excruciating pain. ""The physical and psychological symptoms for vaginismus matched up with mine so I decided to go to my university's student health clinic. ""The nurse suggested that I do some stretches with my fingers every day and see how I felt after a couple of months - it was completely unhelpful and, if anything, I had even less confidence than when I walked in there. ""My GP later told me it can be a very psychological condition - my brain associates sex with pain and so my body does everything it can to prevent that pain. ""This condition has made me feel increasingly angry, frightened, isolated, inadequate, anxious and depressed. ""I fear not only sex but any kind of intimacy and I have lost interest in doing anything. ""This put a huge strain on my relationship, leading to daily arguments and constant self-blaming on my part. I kept thinking it was all my fault my relationship was ruined because my body was malfunctioning. ""Eventually we faced the fact that I couldn't continue with it any longer, with the guilt of depriving any form of physicality to the relationship as well as being constantly angry. ""I don't know what it will take to 'fix' me but I am coming to terms with the fact this is going to be my life for quite a while and I don't think I'll be able to have any form of relationship in that time. ""The psychological effects are more damaging than the physical - I strongly feel the shame of the inability to have sex. ""Health issues related todyspareunia,externalneed to be looked into - we all what know erectile dysfunction is but we hardly know anything about how dyspareunia affects women's health."" Margaret (not her real name), aged 68, has not had sex with her husband for 16 years because of pain she experiences during intercourse. ""There is a link between the physical side and the emotional impact. ""At the beginning we had sex a lot and I never thought something like this would happen. ""GPs are impatient and do not take me seriously - they say that women my age should not expect an enjoyable sex life. ""I got used to it but it has an impact on our relationship. My husband says that he does not mind that we cannot have sex but it is important to me and it makes me feel really sad - I  feel like I've cheated my husband of a proper sex life. ""I used to think that it would improve but now I have just given up on the idea that we will ever have a sex life again.""

Bad air,"Cities are at their busiest during the day - and their most polluted Part two of our series ""A day in the life of a city"" looks at the ways in which offices are changing and how cities are coping with the ever-growing problem of pollution. The morning rush hour is over and, if you live in a city in the developed world, you are likely to be settling down at your desk for the next eight or so hours. However, the office block and skyscraper, which have been part of our urban landscape since the end of the 19th Century, may also soon become surplus to requirements. Should we rethink our office space? Urban architect Anthony Townsend thinks cities need more creative approaches to how we work and is keen to reclaim the streets by creating pop-up workspaces in the parks and plazas of the financial district in New York. ""Before the New York Stock Exchange, traders met under a tree on Wall Street to buy and sell shares. It is only in the last 50 years that we have taken that creative energy and sucked it up into office buildings and separated it from public space,"" he said. An atrium filled with natural light and the smell of fresh coffee greets workers at Deloitte's Edge headquarters in Amsterdam, which also uses an underwater aquifer to provide ambient temperature all year round and a sensor network to monitor the use of lights - providing a better working environment while saving money. The Edge has been dubbed one of the world's greenest offices and now many are following suit - installing sensors to monitor light, electricity and water usage, planting urban gardens and offering employees access to bike or car-sharing schemes. When you pop out to buy your lunchtime sandwich though, it is a different matter. Cities are huge polluters - responsible for 70% of the world's carbon emissions, according to the United Nations. In Singapore huge man-made super-trees house a variety of flora and fauna And, according to the World Health Organization, more than 80% of people living in urban areas that monitor air pollution are exposed to air quality levels that exceed WHO limits. While all regions of the world are affected, populations in low income cities are the most impacted. Cities are literally getting greener - with foliage-covered walls popping up in many To counteract this, cities are rushing out a whole series of green initiatives - from electric buses (being trialled in many cities including Perth, London and Paris), to bike-sharing schemes, such as those in Montreal, Barcelona and Amsterdam. Some are committing to ""urban greening"" - London is considering a garden bridge - while in Paris, 20,000 residents have backed plans via a citizen engagement app 'Madam Mayor, I have an idea' for a 2m euro ($2.2m, Â£1.7m) investment in vertical gardens across the city. Officials have found 40 potential sites and are now calling on gardeners, landscape designers, urban farmers and architects to bid for projects. Horticulturist and designer Patrick Blanc has been creating vertical gardens since 2001 in city hotels, malls and tower blocks around the world. The benefits are many-fold, he said. As well as acting as a natural biofilter and providing a habitat for birds and bugs, it also feeds humans' natural sense of well-being in nature, a phenomenon known as biophilia. China is turning to machine learning to predict smog levels In China, it will take more than planting trees to combat pollution. The city authorities in smog-ridden Bejiing are working closely with IBM to use machine learning techniques to analyse weather and emissions data to predict how bad air will be over the next 10 days. According to Jonathan Batty, an IBM executive who helped set up the system, it has allowed the authorities to take short-term preventative measures. ""That might mean closing factories for a couple of days or reducing urban traffic or stopping construction work,"" he said. The government also uses the data to provide a traffic light warning system for citizens - red means air pollution is high so spend the minimum time outside, while green indicates safe levels. A day in the life of a city - Morning Search for the world's smartest city Can cities help you find your happy place? Read all the BBC's Tomorrow's Cities coverage London provides a similar system on its city dashboard which is available to Londoners on the web. Prof Andy Hudson-Smith, who heads up University College London's Centre for Advance Spatial Analysis, came up with the idea to share data with the wider public. ""Cities now do have vast amount of information on air pollution and the data from London is all bad but it seems that citizens haven't woken up to how bad the air is,"" he said. ""I'm surprised that people haven't kicked off. This stuff is life-threatening - if you live on a main road, it can take five years off your life."" Would you take an internet-connected gnome seriously? The problem with the current way of collecting air pollution data is that often people do not understand what the readings mean, he thinks. So he has a cunning plan to ""humanise IoT"" (the internet of things). He is putting around 100 internet-connected gnomes in the Olympic Park in East London. The gnomes will talk back to people as they go around the park and among other things will tell them how bad the air pollution is. Unlike more complex data sets, they will be more plain speaking, said Prof Hudson-Smith. ""They will probably just tell you to go home."" A citizen-based approach to smart technology in Jakarta SMART CITY CASE STUDY: Jakarta Jakarta launched its smart city programme in 2014 and rather than spend vast sums of money on platforms provided by firms such as IBM and Schneider Electric, it decided its smart city approach would be much more citizen-based. It has an app - Qlue - that allows citizens to report issues, upload photos of potholes and abandoned cars they come across around the city. Floods are a major issue there and citizens can also access PetaJakarta, a joint project between the University of Wollongong in Australia and the Jakartan government. It uses tweets about floods to create a real-time map of the city. Jakarta tweets more than any other city in the world and also faces some of the worst congestion, so a Twitter account offering lift-shares - dubbed Nebenger - has attracted some 93,000 residents In another congestion-busting initiative, the city is now partnering with Google-owned navigation app Waze to share data about traffic conditions around the city.

Japan gets first sumo champion in 19 years,"This video can not be played Kisenosato posed for photos with a red sea bream, a traditional way to mark victory Japan has formally named its first home-grown sumo grand champion in almost two decades, in a boost to the traditional wrestling sport. Kisenosato, 30, was promoted to the top-most yokozuna rank after his win in the first tournament of the year. He is the first Japanese-born wrestler to make it since Wakanohana in 1998. Five wrestlers from American Samoa and Mongolia have made it in the interim. Foreign wrestlers have come to dominate sumo, amid a lack of local recruits. Kisenosato, who comes from Ibaraki to the north of Tokyo and weighs 178kg (392 pounds), has been an ozeki - the second-highest rank - since 2012. After being runner-up on multiple occasions, he finally clinched his first tournament victory - and thereby his promotion to yokozuna - in the first competition of 2017. ""I accept with all humility,"" Kisenosato said in a press conference after the Japan Sumo Association formally approved him. ""I will devote myself to the role and try not to disgrace the title of yokozuna."" Wakanohana (R), seen here fighting Hawaiian Akebono, was the last Japanese wrestler to be promoted to yokozuna Japan's much-loved traditional sport dates back hundreds of years. Two wrestlers face off in an elevated circular ring and try to push each other to the ground or out of the ring. There are six tournaments each year in which each wrestler fights 15 bouts. Wrestlers, who traditionally go by one fighting name, are ranked and the ultimate goal is to become a yokozuna. Many Japanese fans will be pleased to see a local wrestler back at the top of a sport regarded as a cultural icon. As yokuzuna, Kisenosato, whose real name is Yutaka Hagiwara, joins three other wrestlers in sumo's ultimate rank - Hakuho, Harumafuji and Kakuryu. The trio all come from Mongolia, following a path forged by sumo bad-boy Asashoryu, who was Mongolia's first yokozuna in 2003. The last Japanese-born wrestlers to reach the top were brothers Takanohana and Wakanohana, who made it to yokozuna in 1994 and 1998 respectively. In recent years, sumo has been hit by falling numbers of Japanese recruits, partly because it is seen as a tough, highly regimented life. Young sumo wrestlers train in tightly-knit ""stables"" where they eat, sleep and practise together and are sometimes subjected to harsh treatment in the belief that it will toughen them up. In 2009, a leading coach was jailed for six years for ordering wrestlers to beat a young trainee who later died, in a case that shocked the nation. Those at the top of the sport are also expected to be role models, showing honour and humility - and can be criticised if they get it wrong. Mongolian wrestler Asashoryu led the sport for many years, but sumo elders were troubled by some of his behaviour Sumo must also compete with the rising popularity of football and baseball, which have vibrant leagues that draw crowds of young Japanese fans. But the sport is attractive to wrestlers from other nations, who can earn a good living. Wrestlers have come from Estonia, Bulgaria, Georgia, China, Hawaii and Egypt, as well as Mongolia and American Samoa. As a child, Kisenosato was a pitcher in his school's baseball club before he chose to train as a wrestler at a stable in Tokyo. He made his debut in 2002 and, reported Japan's Mainichi newspaper, the 73 tournaments he took to become a yokozuna are the most by any wrestler since 1926. Speaking to reporters after the tournament victory on Monday that sealed his elevation, Kisenosato said he was pleased to be holding the Emperor's Cup trophy at last. ""I've finally got my hands on it and the sense of pleasure hasn't changed,"" he said. ""It's hard to put into words but it has a nice weight to it."" Non-Japanese sumos filling top ranks.

Lovelorn red panda escapes from US zoo,"Sunny, a 19-month-old red panda, has been missing since Monday Zoo officials say that a female red panda named Sunny has been missing from its enclosure since Monday afternoon. Norfolk police are helping workers at the Virginia Zoo using a ""geothermal camera"" to search the grounds for her, officials said on Wednesday. People living near the zoo have been asked to keep an eye out for the reddish-brown mammal. Zoo director Greg Bockheim told the Virginian-Pilot newspaper love may have driven 19-month-old Sunny to run away. This video can not be played Red pandas have a natural love for snow and cold weather ""This is panda breeding season, so the animals become a bit more agitated,"" Mr Bockheim said. ""We're super hopeful we'll find her today,"" he added. Officials are hopeful that she may still be on zoo grounds. ""Red pandas are generally not considered aggressive animals, but like any wild animal its behavior can be unpredictable and you should not try to touch, feed, or capture Sunny yourself,"" zoo officials said ina statement,external. The zoo asks that the public call their hotline if they spot Sunny. One neighbour told local news that she plans to follow that advice. ""The panda's probably scared himself,"" Lazara Jorrin told CBS News. ""This is new to him, so we don't know how he'll react."" Red pandas - which arenative to China and the Himalayas- have been known to escape zoo enclosures in the past. Rusty the red panda escaped from the Smithsonian's National Zoo in Washington DC in 2013 and was later found roaming the streets. In 2007, the same Virginia Zoo lost sight of another red panda named Yin before discovering it in a nearby tree. And in 2009 a red pandaescaped from the London Zoo,externaland was discovered on a park bench in Regent's Park in the early hours.

Embarrassing climbdown or goodwill gesture?Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor25 January 2017 (14:20:08),"It was only yesterday that the Brexit Secretary, David Davis, told MPs it just might all be a bit tricky to have a White Paper, a formal document outlining the government's plans for Brexit, and stick to the timetable they want to pursue. Rebel Remainers though were ""delighted"", that, stealing Jeremy Corbyn's thunder, a planted question from a loyal Tory MP at PMQs today produced in fact a promise from the Prime Minister that, after all, there will be a White Paper. It is a climbdown, no question, a last-minute change of heart. Late last night Brexiteers were being assured there would be no bending, no delay to the government's plans and no giving in to the Remainers. Even early this morning, government sources were privately suggesting that they were quite happy to have the white paper option up their sleeve, but there were no immediate plans to make that promise. Then voila, at 1205 GMT, the pledge of a white paper suddenly emerged. As one senior Tory joked, ""welcome to the vacillation of the next two years"". It may be being described as a ""massive, unplanned"" concession but it doesn't seriously hurt the government. First off, it shows goodwill to the rebel Tory Remainers, many of whom feel their Eurosceptic rivals have had the upper hand of late. Schmoozing matters round these parts. It takes one of the potential arguments that could have gathered pace off the table, before the Article 50 bill is even published. And, rightly or wrongly, no one expects a white paper will contain anything new that the prime minister has not yet already said. It's largely a victory for the Remainers about process, rather than substance. For her critics this is evidence of weakness, that's she has been pushed into changing her mind. But it doesn't need to change the government's timetable, and today's embarrassment of a climbdown might be worth the goodwill that Number 10 will get in return.

Orla Guerin: Paying the price for seeking freedom in Egypt25 January 2017 (02:38:24),"Mahmoud Hussein says he needs a crutch because of abuse and medical neglect in prison It is six years since the outbreak of the 18-day revolution in Egypt which swept the autocrat, Hosni Mubarak, from power. But human rights campaigners say the situation in the country is now far worse than before the uprising, as Orla Guerin reports from Cairo. With every step he takes, Mahmoud Mohammed Hussein is reminded of the price he paid for wanting freedom and democracy in Egypt. The 21-year-old has a pronounced limp and relies on a crutch - a legacy, he says, of beatings during almost 800 days in a series of prisons. Ten months have passed since his release, but he still appears frail. Mahmoud is one of thousands who have been detained in recent years under Egypt's latest strongman, President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi. As army chief he led the military overthrow of Egypt's first democratically-elected president, Mohammed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood, in 2013. Since then Mr Sisi has presided over a sweeping crackdown on dissent - ensnaring Islamists, liberals, journalists, aid workers, and icons of the revolution of 2011. People took to the streets of Cairo on 25 January 2011 to demand Hosni Mubarak resign Mahmoud joined the throngs behind bars back in 2014, when he was just 18. His ordeal began on 25 January, the anniversary of the outbreak of the revolution. His fate was sealed by his T-shirt which read: ""A nation without torture."" ""It was a day of celebration for me,"" said Mahmoud, who has dark curly hair and a ready smile. ""I wasn't part of the revolution, but I believed in it and its goals. It made me feel like a human being, with rights and duties. ""Nowadays, people see the anniversary as a black day, they worry when it comes. For me the mood was one of celebration."" Supporters of Abdul Fattah al-Sisi were allowed to take to the streets on 25 January 2014 But then - as now - the streets were reserved for President Sisi's supporters. They could gather freely, unlike his critics. Protests are virtually banned here. We witnessed police opening fire that day - with live rounds - on unarmed demonstrators. Mahmoud said he was not involved in any of the protests, but that he was detained as he headed for home. ""The officer who arrested me told me, 'You have my picture on your T-shirt',"" he said. ""The T-shirt was inspired by the revolution. I saw it as a beautiful thing, not a crime. A country without torture is a dream that everyone wishes for."" Dozens died in clashes with security forces at anti-government protests three years ago That dream was apparently not shared by the police he encountered that day. Mahmoud said they soon employed the torture skills for which human rights groups have long condemned the Egyptian police. ""I was abused at the checkpoint where I was arrested,"" he told us. ""Then they transferred me to the police station. I was electrocuted on my private parts. They kicked me with their military boots, and hit me with sticks. ""Everyone knew I was there because of the T-shirt. They believed this was a personal insult to them, so they beat me."" The aim, he said, was to get him to sign a false confession. Mahmoud Hussein (centre) was photographed with the T-shirt reading ""A nation without torture"" ""A senior officer beat me and kicked me and then asked junior police officers to do the job,"" he said. ""They wanted me to sign a report saying I was against the police. I refused. The juniors have their own ways - if beating doesn't work, then electrocution might do the job. ""I was stripped naked, without even boxer shorts, and I was beaten just to admit to certain charges"". Mahmoud asked the officers to spare his leg, which was injured in the past. ""They insisted on kicking me and beating me on that leg,"" he said. ""Because of all the abuse and the medical neglect in prison I now need my friend, the crutch, and two surgeries."" His account is consistent with testimony from others who have been detained in recent years. We asked the Egyptian government for a response to the allegation that detainees have been beaten and tortured in custody. There was no reply. In the past the authorities have denied there is systematic torture, but said there may be individual cases. Mahmoud faces charges including joining a banned terrorist group - something he denies Mahmoud described both physical and psychological abuse. He told us he spent 14 months in one overcrowded cell where he could barely move, and could not see daylight. There were about 150 other prisoners, including Islamists and men held for rape and murder. ""I always had this element of fear,"" he said, ""All the time, because prison is like a tomb. It's a place that takes away your soul, and kills everything beautiful in you."" Tens of thousands of people have been jailed in a sweeping crackdown on dissent since 2013 Mahmoud was released from detention last March - following campaigns at home and abroad. While he is back home with his family in Cairo, he is not completely free. He still faces charges including joining an unauthorized protest, possession of explosives and joining a banned terrorist group - all of which he denies. ""I could go back to prison at any time,"" he said. ""They could just pick me walking on the street. ""Since my release that has happened twice. I was held for a few hours and then they let me go."" Public criticism and peaceful opposition are effectively banned in Egypt, rights activists say Mahmoud has also been receiving threatening phone calls. ""One told me I would not have time to come back to prison,"" he said, ""meaning that someone could stab me or kill me. I didn't reply. I just hung up."" In spite of all the dangers, including the risk that he could be put on trial, Mahmoud refuses to be silenced. ""In Egypt my rights and the rights of thousands of others like me are violated, just for dreaming or hoping for freedom,"" he said. ""Their destiny is prison, or death. That's not going to stop me from speaking out, or caring for thousands like me. "" Officials here would not give us a comment on allegations that all dissent is being crushed. President Sisi said in September that ""there can be no return to dictatorship"" President Sisi has said in the past that stability is more important than freedom, but he maintains that dictatorship cannot return to Egypt. Critics believe in some key respects it never left. When asked if the revolution is now dead, Mahmoud gave a swift response. ""No, not at all,"" he insisted. ""25 January is a dream that will never die. The revolution lives in the hearts of people like me, of everyone who believes in it. ""The current regime is trying desperately to erase it from memory."" As for the T- shirt that cost him his freedom, he has no regrets. ""I always say that if I could go back, in spite of all the abuses I suffered, I would wear the T-shirt again,"" he said.

Justin Rowlatt: What will Trump do about Afghanistan?,"There are still 13,000 Nato military personnel in Afghanistan, mostly American As Donald Trump settles into his new home in the White House, one of the most pressing issues in his in-tray is Afghanistan. America's longest war isn't something that he has said much about, and - as with so many issues - what he has said is contradictory. In the past, he has described America's involvement in Afghanistan as a ""disaster"", and has talked about pulling out US troops. But when he spoke to Afghan President Ashraf Ghani on 2 December, he reportedly told him that America would not waver in its commitment to Afghanistan. Then, however, he failed to invite Mr Ghani to his inauguration, deepening worries in Afghanistan that it simply was not a priority for the new president. Afghan President Ashraf Ghani praised the US for its commitment to Afghanistan, during his first official visit to Washington in 2015 The Taliban pitched in earlier this week, calling on President Trump to withdraw American forces from what they described as the ""quagmire"" of Afghanistan. ""Nothing has been achieved,"" said the insurgent group, ""except the staining of innocent Afghans in their blood, and the destruction of villages and gardens."" The official American assessment of progress is not much more upbeat. Mr Trump's challengewas summarised with shocking clarity earlier this month by the US watchdog overseeing the reconstruction process in Afghanistan,external, the special inspector general for Afghanistan, John F Sopko. Mr Sopko says the US has spent more in real terms in Afghanistan than America spent on the reconstruction of Europe after World War Two, yet only 63% of the country is currently controlled by the Afghan government, opium production is at record highs and corruption is still rife. ""After 15 years,"" he says, ""Afghanistan still cannot support itself financially or functionally. ""Long-term financial assistance is required if the country is to survive."" Just how vulnerable parts of the country are became very apparent when an Afghan colleague was given rare access to the battle against the Taliban in Helmand a few weeks ago. Aziz Ahmad Shafee flew into the provincial capital, Lashkargah, with soldiers from the Afghan National Army's 215th Corps. A convoy of Humvees drove the troops a few kilometres to the outskirts of the city: that is where the front line is now. Afghan soldiers told the BBC they lacked even the most basic supplies The Taliban now control more than 80% of Helmand. A province, let us not forget, where most of the 456 British military personnel killed in the Afghan conflict lost their lives. And - despite a complete restructuring of the command of the 215th Corps overseen by American forces - it seems it still is not combat effective. Afghan troops complain they lack even the most basic supplies. ""For a month we've been saying we are running out of ammunition but we don't get any new supplies,"" Sgt class 1 Hyatullah told the BBC. ""Our enemy is firing at us, but we don't have enough bullets to take them on."" His commander urged America's new president not to falter in his commitment to the Afghan government. ""As a soldier of Afghanistan, I ask his excellency Donald Trump to continue the fight here"", said Brig Gen Mohammad Wali Ahmadzai, the commander of the 215th Corps in Helmand. ""If he can give us more support, we can wipe the terrorists out."" Most of the foreign troops in Afghanistanwere withdrawn at the end of 2014, but when I visited the headquarters of Resolute Support, the Nato mission in Afghanistan, it was busy, with helicopters flying in and out every few minutes. There are still 13,000 Nato military personnel in Afghanistan, mostly American. Most US military personnel have left Afghanistan - there is little appetite for more losses among the US public Brig Gen Charlie Cleveland, the spokesman for the Resolute Support mission, believes America still has a clear strategic interest in Afghanistan. He says the US troops now have two tasks: training and assisting the Afghan army targeting terrorist organisations Resolute Support's work with the Afghan army has, says the brigadier general, been instrumental in ensuring it has managed to hold the ground it does. ""In the winter of 2015-16, the government of Afghanistan changed their strategy,"" Brig Gen Cleveland tells me. ""They realised they couldn't defend everywhere, and so what they really started focusing their efforts on was the major population centres. ""As we look at the security situation right now, the government controls - secures - really about two-thirds of the population. ""About 10% of the population is controlled by the Taliban, and the remaining difference is really what's contested."" He says while this situation is not ideal, the Afghan army has managed to reverse what was a deteriorating situation in 2015 and establish an ""equilibrium"" in favour of the government. Nevertheless, there is much work to be done. Some 5,000 Afghan military personnel were killed last year, losses both the Afghan government and Resolute Support agree are unsustainable in the long term. Afghan security forces have launched operations against both Taliban and IS militants And, amid the uncertainty about American policy, other powers have been flexing their muscles in Afghanistan. Last month, Russia hosted a meeting in Moscow about the country's future, with senior officials from China and Pakistan, and it makes no secret of the fact it has been talking to the Taliban. So the big question is what will President Trump do? Two of his key cabinet picks may provide a clue. President Trump's Defence Secretary,Gen James Mattis, is a former commander of forces here. He has spoken in the past about the need to urge Pakistan to take further action against the Taliban andthe Sunni Islamist militant Haqqani network. Soviet troops pulled out of Afghanistan in 1988, but Russia is talking to the Taliban The new president's national security adviser,Lt Gen Michael Flynn, has also talked about the need for Pakistan to take tougher action against Taliban fighters who shelter there. And President Trump has been very consistent about his desire to take a tougher line against the so-called Islamic State group. Pulling out of Afghanistan would make that more difficult,given the toe-hold it has established in eastern Afghanistanover the past couple of years. So it seems unlikely that - in his effort to extricate America from foreign entanglements - President Trump will simply declare that it has no strategic interest in Afghanistan and withdraw his troops. He and his advisers will certainly not want to be responsible for America's longest war ending in what many people would regard as a clear defeat.

Matt McGrath: Trump's 'control-alt-delete' on climate,"Amid concerns over his attitude to climate change, the new President has signed orders to push forward with two major oil pipelines Are the recent actions taken by the Trump team on the issues of climate and energy the opening shots in a war on knowledge? Or are they simply what you'd expect from a new administration of a different political hue? Let's examine what we know. Just after Donald Trump was inaugurated as the 45th president, a range of information on the White House website related to climate change was moved to anObama online archive,external. The only references to rising temperatures on the new Trump White House site are acommitment to eliminate,external""harmful and unnecessary policies such as the Climate Action Plan"". This was President Obama's broad-based strategy to cut carbon emissions. The brief White House document now contains a further indication of the green priorities of the new administration. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), should focus on its ""essential mission of protecting our air and water"". The Twitter account of Badlands National Park has seen a number of tweets relating to climate change deleted While the administration figures out how to achieve that re-focus, staff at the EPA have been told to freeze all grant making, and to be quiet about it. This means that no external press releases will be issued and no social media posts will be permitted. It is unclear when these restrictions will be lifted. Reports from news agencies indicate that the roll-back will not stop there, with climate information pages hosted by the EPA expected to be shut down. ""My guess is the web pages will be taken down, but the links and information will be available,"" the prominent climate sceptic and adviser to the Trump transition team, Myron Ebell, told Reuters. ""If the website goes dark, years of work we have done on climate change will disappear,"" said an anonymous EPA staff member,according to reports,external. The Trump team has also taken immediate steps to push forward with two controversial oil pipelines. So are all these moves evidence of a malevolent mindset, determined to crush all this snowflake climate change chatter? Definitely, according to Alden Meyer, a veteran climate campaigner with the Union of Concerned Scientists. ""President Trump and his team are pursuing what I call a 'control-alt-delete' strategy: control the scientists in the federal agencies, alter science-based policies to fit their narrow ideological agenda, and delete scientific information from government websites,"" told BBC News. ""This is an across-the-board strategy that we are seeing at multiple federal agencies on a range of issues, though climate denialism is clearly the point of the spear."" Not according to White House spokesman Sean Spicer. ""I don't think it's any surprise that when there's an administration turnover, that we're going to review the policy,"" he said. Howeverthe disappearance of tweetsof basic climate change information from the Badlands National Park Twitter account has raised serious concerns that the Trump team is not just seeking to roll back regulation, but is also taking an ideological stand against what they might see as ""warmist"" propaganda. Protesters have maintained a long-term presence to stall progress on the Dakota Access Pipeline Back in 2009, President Obama enacted rules that federal agencies should have scientific integrity policies, that guaranteed the rights of free speech of employees, following on from the gagging of some researchers and thealtering of reports under the Bush administration,external. While the current steps being taken by the Trump team may turn out to be less restrictive than feared, on this side of the pond there's a great deal of concern. Scientists see the forthcoming visit of UK prime minister Theresa May to Washington as an opportunity to press the President to rein in his approach. ""We are beginning to see our fears realised less than a week after President Trump has taken office,"" said Bob Ward, from the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment. ""I hope that the Prime Minister will challenge President Trump about this censorship and political interference in the process of gaining and sharing knowledge about climate change during their meeting on Friday."" Climate scientists in the US are also rallying to fight back. Amarch on Washington by scientists,externalis being proposed, Facebook pages and Twitter accounts have been created based on the the idea that ""an American government that ignores science to pursue ideological agendas endangers the world"". Meanwhile, another national park -Golden Gate NPS,external- has started tweeting climate facts.

It made me feel like a human being, with rights and duties. ""Nowadays, people see the anniversary as a black day, they worry when it comes. For me the mood was one of celebration."" Supporters of Abdul Fattah al-Sisi were allowed to take to the streets on 25 January 2014 But then - as now - the streets were reserved for President Sisi's supporters. They could gather freely, unlike his critics. Protests are virtually banned here. We witnessed police opening fire that day - with live rounds - on unarmed demonstrators. Mahmoud said he was not involved in any of the protests, but that he was detained as he headed for home. ""The officer who arrested me told me, 'You have my picture on your T-shirt',"" he said. ""The T-shirt was inspired by the revolution. I saw it as a beautiful thing, not a crime. A country without torture is a dream that everyone wishes for."" Dozens died in clashes with security forces at anti-government protests three years ago That dream was apparently not shared by the police he encountered that day. Mahmoud said they soon employed the torture skills for which human rights groups have long condemned the Egyptian police. ""I was abused at the checkpoint where I was arrested,"" he told us. ""Then they transferred me to the police station. I was electrocuted on my private parts. They kicked me with their military boots, and hit me with sticks. ""Everyone knew I was there because of the T-shirt. They believed this was a personal insult to them, so they beat me."" The aim, he said, was to get him to sign a false confession. Mahmoud Hussein (centre) was photographed with the T-shirt reading ""A nation without torture"" ""A senior officer beat me and kicked me and then asked junior police officers to do the job,"" he said. ""They wanted me to sign a report saying I was against the police. I refused. The juniors have their own ways - if beating doesn't work, then electrocution might do the job. ""I was stripped naked, without even boxer shorts, and I was beaten just to admit to certain charges"". Mahmoud asked the officers to spare his leg, which was injured in the past. ""They insisted on kicking me and beating me on that leg,"" he said. ""Because of all the abuse and the medical neglect in prison I now need my friend, the crutch, and two surgeries."" His account is consistent with testimony from others who have been detained in recent years. We asked the Egyptian government for a response to the allegation that detainees have been beaten and tortured in custody. There was no reply. In the past the authorities have denied there is systematic torture, but said there may be individual cases. Mahmoud faces charges including joining a banned terrorist group - something he denies Mahmoud described both physical and psychological abuse. He told us he spent 14 months in one overcrowded cell where he could barely move, and could not see daylight. There were about 150 other prisoners, including Islamists and men held for rape and murder. ""I always had this element of fear,"" he said, ""All the time, because prison is like a tomb. It's a place that takes away your soul, and kills everything beautiful in you."" Tens of thousands of people have been jailed in a sweeping crackdown on dissent since 2013 Mahmoud was released from detention last March - following campaigns at home and abroad. While he is back home with his family in Cairo, he is not completely free. He still faces charges including joining an unauthorized protest, possession of explosives and joining a banned terrorist group - all of which he denies. ""I could go back to prison at any time,"" he said. ""They could just pick me walking on the street. ""Since my release that has happened twice. I was held for a few hours and then they let me go."" Public criticism and peaceful opposition are effectively banned in Egypt, rights activists say Mahmoud has also been receiving threatening phone calls. ""One told me I would not have time to come back to prison,"" he said, ""meaning that someone could stab me or kill me. I didn't reply. I just hung up."" In spite of all the dangers, including the risk that he could be put on trial, Mahmoud refuses to be silenced. ""In Egypt my rights and the rights of thousands of others like me are violated, just for dreaming or hoping for freedom,"" he said. ""Their destiny is prison, or death. That's not going to stop me from speaking out, or caring for thousands like me. "" Officials here would not give us a comment on allegations that all dissent is being crushed. President Sisi said in September that ""there can be no return to dictatorship"" President Sisi has said in the past that stability is more important than freedom, but he maintains that dictatorship cannot return to Egypt. Critics believe in some key respects it never left. When asked if the revolution is now dead, Mahmoud gave a swift response. ""No, not at all,"" he insisted. ""25 January is a dream that will never die. The revolution lives in the hearts of people like me, of everyone who believes in it. ""The current regime is trying desperately to erase it from memory."" As for the T- shirt that cost him his freedom, he has no regrets. ""I always say that if I could go back, in spite of all the abuses I suffered, I would wear the T-shirt again,"" he said.

Euro 'could collapse in 18 months',"This video can not be played Professor Ted Malloch is gloomy about the euro's future The man tipped to be Donald Trump's ambassador to the European Union has told the BBC the single currency ""could collapse"" in the next 18 months. Professor Ted Malloch said he would ""short the euro"" - taking a market position which bets on the value of the currency falling. He also said Britain could agree a ""mutually beneficial"" free trade deal with America in as little as 90 days. And that it was best for the US if Britain executed a ""clean"" Brexit. Once outside the single market and the customs union, the UK could bypass ""the bureaucrats in Brussels"" and forge a free trade deal, he said. Mr Malloch added that any attempt by the EU to block Britain beginning negotiations with the US would be ""absurd"" and like a husband ""trying to stop his wife having an affair"". Theresa May will be the first foreign leader to meet the new president when she arrives in Washington at the end of the week. The possibility of an early trade deal with America, once the UK has left the EU, will be on the agenda. ""I remind people that the largest merger and acquisition deals in history are often done in about that time frame [90 days],"" Mr Malloch, a professor at Henley Business School, said. ""Some of us who have worked on Wall Street or in the City know that if you get the right people in the right room with the right data and the right energy, and Trump is certainly high energy, you can get things done. The President interviewed Mr Malloch earlier in January ""I think this will cut out the bureaucrats in effect and it won't take two years, it won't take seven years to actually come to an agreement."" He added: ""Obviously there are things to iron out, certainly there are differences and compromises to make, but it can be done. ""So, there won't be a deal signed in the White House on Friday, but there could be an agreement for a framework going forward where people are empowered to have that kind of conversation behind closed doors and it could take as little as 90 days. ""That is very positive and it sends a signal that the United States is behind Great Britain in its hour of need."" Although not yet confirmed, Mr Malloch has been widely reported as being the president's choice for the Brussels role. The economist and former deputy executive secretary to the United Nations in Geneva went for an interview with the president's team at Trump Tower earlier this month. If successful, he will be officially nominated by the Secretary of State elect, Rex Tillerson. The EU has made it clear that Britain cannot enter substantive free trade talks with countries outside the union until it has left the EU, a position Mr Malloch - a supporter of Mr Trump and the Brexit campaign - dismissed. If successful, Mr Malloch will be officially nominated by the Secretary of State elect, Rex Tillerson ""I think it is an absurd proposition and may be a legalism,"" he said. ""There are going to be all kinds of things happening behind closed doors and you can call them what you like. ""The fact is that when your wife is having an affair with someone else, you tell her to stop it, but oftentimes that doesn't stop the relationship."" Many trade experts say the ""90-day"" proposition will be impossible to execute, as there will need to be detailed negotiations on controversial areas such as food imports between the UK and the US, as well as financial services and pharmaceuticals. ""Non-tariff"" barriers such as health and safety regulations and the recognition of professional qualifications will also have to be hammered out. There could also be a need for some form of immigration agreement. Furthermore, Britain is not yet an autonomous member of the World Trade Organisation, which oversees the rules on free trade deals. It negotiates as part of the EU's agreement with the global trade regulator. Government sources insist that transferring full rights to the UK alone will be straightforward. Mr Malloch said despite the obstacles, Britain would gain a free trade deal well ahead of the rest of the EU and the elections in the Netherlands, France and Germany could lead to a fundamental shake-up of the union. ""I personally am not certain that there will be a European Union with which to have [free trade] negotiations,"" he said. ""Will there be potentially numerous bilateral agreements with various countries? ""I think the prospect, in a changed political reality, is greater for that. ""I think Donald Trump is very opposed to supranational organisations, he believes in nation states, in bilateral relations and I think that he thinks the EU has overshot its mark. ""It seems to me as well that Trump believes that the European Union has in recent decades been tilted strongly and most favourably towards Germany."" Mr Malloch said that the present free trade negotiation between the US and the EU - called the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership - was ""dead"". He also questioned the future of the single currency. ""The one thing I would do in 2017 is short the euro,"" Mr Malloch said. ""I think it is a currency that is not only in demise but has a real problem and could in fact collapse in the coming year, year and a half. ""I am not the only person or economist of that point of view. ""Someone as acclaimed as Joseph Stiglitz - the famous World Bank economist - has written an entire book on this subject.""

Trump and truth,"This is a critical moment for journalism, particularly in the United States. More than 40 years ago, the unmasking of the Watergate break-in inspired journalists around the world. Reporters appeared as tireless investigators holding the most powerful to account. Now, a new president declares the fourth estate ""dishonest human beings"". A global survey published last week found only 43% of people trusted the traditional media. Journalists find themselves on the defensive having to demonstrate their integrity to a sceptical public. Donald Trump believes he is in a ""running war"" with parts of the media. This video can not be played Where do Donald Trump supporters get their news from? This struggle over who defines the facts will be a central feature of his administration. Social media enables leaders to bypass traditional media and to talk to the public directly. Donald Trump, with his 34,000 tweets, understands the reach and the power this gives him. He can sit in the White House and, with a single tweet, define the news agenda of the day or distract attention away from uncomfortable news. Some of the traditional media now accept they were instrumental in the rise of Donald Trump. He was good for ratings. He was the ""candidate that kept on giving"", as you would regularly hear in Washington. Controversy surrounded the size of the crowd at Donald Trump's inauguration But President Trump's rise to power was partly built on attacking the media. At rally after rally, I watched Donald Trump point at the press pen and denounce journalists as ""terrible"" people, the ""worst"". It was a deliberate tactic. He wanted to define much of the media as part of the establishment elite who had ignored the plight of ordinary Americans. He sowed the seed that journalists and their stories about him could not be trusted. Painting journalists as untrustworthy gave him cover when he was accused of lying and exaggeration. Trump claims media 'dishonest' over crowd photos Trump's 'alternative facts': Why the row about inauguration 'lies'? Sean Spicer: Who is President Trump's spin doctor? Eight ways the Trump presidency will make history And so we inhabit the ""post-truth world"". Democracy can't function without facts that are widely accepted. It doesn't mean that facts shouldn't be disputed or their meaning argued over, but societies need a bedrock of information to inform their decisions. If conspiracies and exaggerations are accepted as alternative realities, then it is much more difficult for a leader to be judged in the court of public opinion. When, a few days ago, the senior White House aide Kellyanne Conway was asked why the president's press secretary had lied about the crowd size at the inauguration, she defended him by saying he was offering ""alternative facts"". Kellyanne Conway used the term ""alternative facts"" to defend the White House press secretary Her interviewer, Chuck Todd, of NBC, retorted that ""alternative facts aren't facts, they're falsehoods"". It was an early round in the battle for the truth. I recall an exchange I had at a Trump event where it was explained to me that the fact that a lot of people believed something gave it an element of truth. Most Americans still get their news from TV, but more than 30% get it from the internet and particularly from Facebook. There is now a lot of research on the role of social media in spreading false information. In Europe, too, the reputation of the media is under fire. Journalists have been damaged by hacking, by intrusion and the suspicion that they don't tell the whole story. In Germany, parts of the mainstream media were accused of covering up reports ofassaults on women in Cologne on New Year's Day 2016because many of the allegations related to men believed to be migrants. In theEdelman Trust barometer,external- published last week - trust in the media had fallen to an all-time low in 17 of the 28 countries polled. So what is to be done? White House press secretary Sean Spicer says the administration will ""hold the press accountable"" In the United States, news organisations are grappling with difficult questions. When should a tweet from President Trump be allowed to dominate the news agenda? Will the cable networks have the courage to ignore a tweet? Will the networks pursue potentially damaging stories even if it risks losing access or an interview? One TV executive said the biggest challenge was to avoid being seen as part of the ""running war"" that President Trump describes. Some organisations in the US, the UK and Germany -including the BBC- are embracing ""reality checks"" as part of their coverage, but they are time consuming and difficult. Governments, too, are looking into how to boost trust in statistics and official information. It might mean the creation of more agencies that are truly independent of government and politicians. The new White House press secretary has said: ""We are going to hold the press accountable."" It signals a battle over who defines the truth and who defines the facts. American journalism will face one of its severest tests.

The Brexit court case ruling explainedWhat happens now?Gina Miller: Brexit antics 'despicable',"It's done. The Supreme Court has ruled and plotted a course towards Brexit. Amid all the division and rancour over leaving the EU, they have set out how power in the UK is separated between ministers who govern, Parliament that legislates, the devolved bodies that administer parts of the UK and lastly the role of judges in arbitrating between everyone. In essence, the judgement is quite simple because it says that it's for Parliament, not ministers, to change the constitution of the UK. At the heart of this case was the question of what the 1972 European Communities Act, that took the UK into what's now the EU, amounted to. The government argued it was a pipeline down which EU law flowed. Ministers have the power to make and break treaties - that's always been the case. And they argued the 1972 Act is the UK's method of turning the EU treaty into practical law - such as regulations on consumer rights or freedom of movement. But eight of the 11 justices disagreed.In their judgement,external, the majority said the EU law that has poured into the UK through the 1972 Act has become part of the law of our lands. ""One of the fundamental functions of the constitution of any state is to identify the sources of its law,"" said the judgement. ""The 1972 Act effectively constitutes EU law as an entirely new, independent and overriding source of domestic law. Withdrawal... will constitute as significant a constitutional change as that which occurred [when the UK joined]. ""It would be inconsistent with long-standing and fundamental principle for such a far-reaching change to the UK constitutional arrangements to be brought about by ministerial decision or ministerial action alone. ""All the more so when the source in question was brought into existence by Parliament through primary legislation, which gave that source an overriding supremacy in the hierarchy of domestic law sources."" The justices went on to say that leaving the EU wasn't just a case of shredding the membership card. Leaving would involve removing existing domestic rights of UK residents which came from being part of the club. The 11 Supreme Court justices (pictured with Lord Toulson - top row, far left - who is now retired) rejected the government's argument by eight to three Those rights have changed over four decades as ministers have agreed new deals at summits and the union has evolved. But the justices said that the 1972 Act never envisaged those rights could be removed entirely on the whim of a minister following an advisory referendum. This, again, is a matter for Parliament to decide. Now, the government further argued that ministers had the power to take us out of the EU because Parliament had not taken it away. This is an argument about the balance of power between Parliament and ministers which dates back 300 years. But the Supreme Court majority rejected that out of hand because, turning the issue on its head, they said that Parliament could have explicitly told ministers they had the power to trigger Article 50. But where are those words to be found in our law? They don't exist. And if those words don't exist, the power to change the constitution lies with Parliament. What about devolution? Here, the government won hands down. It may look today like something of a pointless victory, given they lost on the fundamental point - but in years to come this judgement will become a key in disputes relating to the complicated jigsaw of how the UK is now governed. In the justice's judgement, the majority said that the EU law that has poured into the UK through the 1972 Act has become part of the law of our lands Firstly, the justices said that while Scottish Parliament and Welsh and Northern Ireland Assemblies had a role in administering EU rules and law (for example, in relation to agriculture) they have no constitutional role in making or breaking the international treaties that lie behind those responsibilities. So what about consulting them? The so-called ""Sewel Convention"" says that government in London will normally consult devolved bodies before passing a law that affects the powers they already exercise. Westminster could come up with all sorts of new laws that affect Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland - but in practice it has promised to *normally* not do so without speaking to them first. And that's the point, say the justices, it's just an assurance - it's not a legally-binding obligation on London. And if it's not a law, the Supreme Court has no role in deciding its workings. That will be a huge blow to Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon's attempts to force Prime Minister Theresa May to cut some kind of unique deal. She's said today there is a ""clear political obligation"" to consult and Scotland's voice ""is simply not being heard"". But the brutal reality is that while there may be political fireworks between Downing Street and Holyrood, the law says London can, quite simply, just get on with Brexit whether the SNP or other parties in the nations like it or not. So on to Northern Ireland: does it have a unique status? Well yes and no. The justices said the Good Friday or Belfast Agreement in 1998 did indeed give its people a lock over their future - but not in this context. The court said: ""In our view this important provision which rose out of the Belfast Agreement gave the people of Northern Ireland the right to determine whether to remain part of the UK or to become part of a united Ireland. ""It neither regulated any other change in the constitutional status of Northern Ireland nor required the consent of a majority of the people of Northern Ireland to the withdrawal of the UK from the EU."" It's now up to ministers to decide what kind of Bill to put before Parliament. It could be very short. ""What form such legislation should take is entirely a matter for Parliament,"" said the justices. ""There is no equivalence between the constitutional importance of a statute, or any other document, and its length or complexity. ""A notice [triggering Article 50] could no doubt be very short indeed, but that would not undermine its momentous significance. ""The essential point is that, if, as we consider, what would otherwise be a prerogative act would result in a change in domestic law, the act can only lawfully be carried out with the sanction of primary legislation enacted by the Queen in Parliament."" It's now up to ministers to decide what kind of Bill to put before Parliament One last point. During the hearing in December, one of the counsel sarcastically quipped that the only reason why everybody was in court was because nobody in government thought there would be a vote to leave. Amid the legal jargon of the judgement, the justices appear sympathetic to that view. ""The effect of any particular referendum must depend on the terms of the statute [law] which authorises it,"" they wrote. ""[Past] legislation authorising a referendum more often than not has provided for the consequences on that result."" The 2015 European Union Referendum Act made no such plans. The subtext of the entire judgement? Former Prime Minister David Cameron really should have thought about what-happens-next and written it into the referendum bill he presented to Parliament.

What happens now?Gina Miller: Brexit antics 'despicable',"The Supreme Court has dismissed the government's appeal in a landmark case about Brexit, meaning Parliament will be required to give its approval before official talks on leaving the EU can begin. The ruling is a significant, although not totally unexpected, setback for Theresa May. What will the prime minister do next and what impact will the ruling have on the process of leaving the EU, following last year's referendum vote? The highest court in the UK dismissed the government's argument that it has the power to begin official Brexit negotiations with the rest of the EU without Parliament's prior agreement. By a margin of eight to three, the 11 justices upheld November's High Court ruling which stated that it would be unlawful for the government to rely on executive powers known as the royal prerogative to implement the outcome of last year's referendum. It said a law would have to be passed to authorise Article 50 but the precise form such legislation should take was ""entirely a matter"" for Parliament. Attorney General Jeremy Wright said the government would ""comply with the judgement of the court and do all that is necessary to implement it"". In a statement to Parliament setting out details of the government's legislative response, David Davis said he intended to publish an outline bill ""within days"". The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the details could be announced as early as Thursday, with a view to staging the first vote next week and getting it through the Commons within a couple of weeks. We will get more details from the government later this week, with draft legislation already said to have been prepared in preparation for the appeal being rejected. The new bill is expected to be short, with the government's lawyer suggesting during the hearing that ""one-line"" legislation could be put forward. Both the House of Commons and House of Lords will have to vote in favour of it. Separately, the government has agreed to produce an official policy document known as a White Paper explaining its objectives for the upcoming Brexit negotiations. Ministers initially resisted the move, saying it would take too long, but Theresa May has agreed to it. The concession is being seen as a victory for opposition parties and a group of former Tory ministers who oppose a so-called ""hard Brexit"" and want to examine the government's plans in greater detail. The bill will be given special priority by Parliament, whose order of business is still largely controlled by ministers. While Tory MPs would like to see it fast-tracked through Parliament, many Labour, Lib Dem and SNP MPs will want as much time as possible to discuss a variety of issues and to make amendments. The SNP responded to the ruling by saying it would table 50 ""serious and substantive"" amendments. Labour said it too would seek to amend the bill but would not ""frustrate"" the Brexit process. However it pans out, BBC Parliamentary correspondent Mark D'Arcy says the bill could pass through the Commons before the half-term recess in the middle of February, giving ample time for the Lords to then consider it and for it to become law before the end of March. While there are some MPs who want the process to be delayed, they are vastly outnumbered by those who want the government to get on with it so that the UK will have left the EU by the time of the next election - scheduled for May 2020. In theory, yes there is. But in reality it is extremely unlikely to happen. Few, if any, Conservative MPs are likely to vote against Article 50. In fact, only one - the europhile former chancellor Ken Clarke - has said he will do so. Given that the Tories have a working majority of 15 in the Commons, this means that the bill is guaranteed to pass - especially since a majority of Labour MPs have said they will not stand in the way of the process and many will actually vote for Article 50. Although the Lib Dems, the SNP and some Labour MPs are likely to vote against, this will make little difference. What will be more interesting is if a coalition of pro-European Conservatives and opposition MPs join forces to win concessions, over the extent of Parliamentary scrutiny of the two-year process. Events in the Lords - where the government does not have a working majority and there are 178 non-affiliated cross-bench peers - could be more unpredictable. Mark D'Arcy says there are murmurings of an organised attempt to resist Article 50 and a ""doomed last stand"" by diehard Remainers. But amid warnings that any attempt to block Brexit could trigger a general election, in which the future of the Lords would be a major issue - it is likely that the skirmishes will amount to just that and the government will eventually get its way. The Supreme Court case wasn't just a battle over the powers of the executive and the legislature. The justices heard a number of separate but related challenges to the government's Brexit approach, centred around the involvement of the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. But the court unanimously ruled that devolved administrations did not need to be consulted, and did not have a right to veto Article 50. The government has previously said Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will be kept fully involved.

Gina Miller: Brexit antics 'despicable',"This video can not be played Gina Miller was the lead claimant against the government in the Supreme Court The woman who brought the successful legal challenge against the government over Brexit has accused prominent politicians of behaving ""despicably"". Gina Miller told the BBC they had ""exacerbated"" worries during and after the EU vote and failed to defend her and others with ""legitimate concerns"" about the process in the face of abuse. She insists she did not bring her case to thwart the UK's exit from the EU. But she said some politicians were in ""la la land"" about what lay in store. Profile of Gina Miller Court rules against government on Brexit Brexit court ruling: What happens now? Live updates on Brexit ruling The investment manager was speaking to the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg after the Supreme Court upheld her challenge to the government's approach. By a margin of eight to three, the justices ruled that Parliament must give its consent before Theresa May can start official talks on the terms of the UK's exit. Ministers say it was right for the court to decide and they will comply with the ruling. Mrs Miller, who voted to remain in the EU, said she felt vindicated but that her goal all along had been to give a voice to the millions of people with a stake in the process and help deliver ""the best Brexit we can get"". ""This is about right and wrong, it's wrong that a government think they are above the law. It's right that I can bring this case,"" she said. The 51-year old, who was born in Guyana but educated in Britain, suggested the EU referendum had created a climate of fear in which anyone asking questions about Brexit was seen as unpatriotic and ""branded as traitors"". ""There's this sense that if you ask a question about Brexit then you're not representing Britain,"" she said. ""Asking questions about Brexit is the most patriotic thing you can do."" She added: ""People voted because of legitimate concerns. Politicians have behaved despicably because they have exacerbated those anxieties."" Asked if Theresa May and her ministers had behaved ""despicably"", Ms Miller said it was ""wrong of them not to stand up earlier when the judges were being vilified"". ""I think it was wrong of them to not actually speak up sooner about abuse for not just myself but for other people who live in the UK."" Mrs Miller, who says she has been subjected to constant abuse including death threats, said she felt her ""family and safety have been put in jeopardy"". ""The idea that as a woman I had no right to speak out and I'm not bright enough to speak out. And as an ethnic woman I have no place in society. That's worrying."" She said she was still concerned that politicians were ""twisting the truth"" when it came to the UK's future outside the EU and Mrs May and her ministers needed to ""be honest"" with the public about what was achievable from the negotiations. ""Even now, some of the things I hear about what is possible, as we progress Brexit, it's as though they are living in some sort of la la land because it's pure fantasy."" She added: ""There are 27 other member states on the other side of the table who are not just going to give us what we want. They are not going to give us cherry picking"".

Keeping up appearances,"Some employers have rules regarding acceptable shades of lipstick MPs havecalled for companieswith sexist dress codes to be fined. But many jobs do have requirements for employees' appearances. ""No, however a policy of requiring women to wear high heels would likely amount to sex discrimination which is unlawful,"" says employment law solicitor Laura Allner, a senior associate at CMS. ""Where a policy clearly treats women less favourably than men, for example applying strict image criteria to females but no corresponding rules for men, then this would constitute direct sex discrimination, to which there is no defence."" Laura Allner of CMS Cameron McKenna says it would be difficult for a firm to justify forcing its female staff to wear high heels Mrs Allner adds: ""A policy of wearing high heels would almost certainly be considered 'indirectly discriminatory' provided a female complainant could show that the policy puts women - and her in particular - generally at a disadvantage.  Given the health issues associated with high heels, this argument would have merit. ""It would then be open for the employer to try to defend its dress policy.  To succeed the employer would need to show that it has a legitimate business interest for implementing the policy, and that its dress code is a measured way of achieving that. ""Where the defence is purely aesthetic, it would almost inevitably fail.  It is almost impossible to see how a tribunal could find a policy of requiring high heels justifiable - why not allow smart, flat shoes? ""Further, if an employee suffered from a disability, the employer is under a duty to make reasonable adjustments. So if health reasons meant that wearing heels was not appropriate, the employer would need to adjust its policy."" Employers can implement a dress code to ensure that employees are dressed in a manner that is appropriate for its particular business, provided this would not be deemed discriminatory. Employees can be asked to cover tattoos Mrs Allner says: ""A key issue is whether or not the employer can justify its policy - namely, show that the dress code being implemented is proportionate for it to achieve its particular business aim. ""For example, if there are health and safety reasons requiring employees' hair to be kept in a particular style, then this may be justifiable.  If a policy is purely implemented for stylistic reasons, then it is less likely to be justifiable. ""Previous high profile cases have considered bans on wearing religious items. The case law shows that the cases are very fact specific."" An employee can raise a grievance (either informally or formally) with his or her employer. ""If having done so, the employee wishes to take the matter further, it may be possible to raise a complaint of unlawful discrimination in an employment tribunal, if they have first sought to resolve the matter through the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service, which is now mandatory,"" says Mrs Allner. Garish nail polish might be banned under some employer's rules ""It would be advisable to take legal advice before doing so, to understand the legal merits of the case.  Where an employee has been dismissed, or resigns in response to a discriminatory policy, the employee may also have a claim for unfair dismissal,"" she adds. Where an employee succeeds in a claim of unlawful discrimination, compensation is awarded largely on the basis of injury to feelings so the complainant would need to evidence this. ""Although theoretically uncapped, awards for a single one-off incident are likely to be at the lower end of the scale,"" says Mrs Allner. ""If the employee has also been dismissed or resigns and succeeds in a claim for constructive unfair dismissal, then again compensation for a discriminatory dismissal is uncapped and includes an element for lost earnings too."" However, in an unfair dismissal claim where there is no element of discrimination, lost earnings compensation is capped at the lower of the employee's gross annual salary, or Â£78,962. ""In an unfair dismissal case, employees are also under a duty to mitigate their losses by seeking alternative employment,"" says Mrs Allner.

Superb Serena Williams ends Konta hopes,"This video can not be played Konta values Australian Open experience Australian Open 2017 Venue:Melbourne Park, MelbourneDates:16-29 Jan Coverage:Daily live commentary on BBC Radio 5 live sports extra; live text on selected matches on the BBC Sport website; TV highlights on BBC Two and online from 21 January. Six-time champion Serena Williams outplayed Britain's Johanna Konta to reach the Australian Open semi-finals. The American, 35, won 6-2 6-3 and will next play unseeded CroatMirjana Lucic-Baroni,who beat fifth-seeded Czech Karolina Pliskova 6-4 3-6 6-4. Konta, seeded ninth, went into the quarter-final on a nine-match and 18-set winning streak but came up short in her first meeting with Williams. Williams is now two wins from claiming an Open-era record 23rd major title. Watch day 10 highlights on BBC Two from 16:45 GMT on Wednesday Nadal beats Raonic to reach semi-finals Latest Australian Open scores & schedule ""Johanna Konta has been playing so well,"" said the second seed. ""I was in the locker room watching her clean up her matches. She is a future champion here for sure, so I am pleased to get through this. ""I got a little frustrated with my serve, but I told myself 'don't get Babyrena' [Williams' angry alter-ego] and focused on enjoying myself out here. Today I felt I can do this, it is such a great opportunity for me."" Konta described facing Williams as the""best experience of my life"". Konta had not dropped a set in her past nine matches before facing Williams In a match of big hitting and small margins, it was Williams who established an early control she would not relinquish. The American's usually dominant first serve faltered as she made just 45%, but she returned brilliantly to break the Konta serve - the best on tour this season going into the match - four times. Konta had the first chance but went long with a backhand on break point at 1-1, then found her second serve under greater pressure than at any stage of the tournament so far. Williams looked razor sharp on return, with two thumping forehand winners setting the American on the way to a 3-1 lead. More heavy blows brought a second break, and with it the set, in game eight to end a run of 18 straight sets for Konta stretching back to herwarm-up win in Sydney. Konta showed why she had been seen as a real threat by recovering from 0-40 early in the second set and then breaking to lead 3-1, but a loose game handed the advantage back and Williams raced through five straight games to victory. BBC tennis correspondent Russell Fuller No matter how many times you have watched Serena Williams play, it is perhaps just not possible to appreciate how hard she hits the ball - and how quickly it arrives on your racquet - until you have shared a court with her. Johanna Konta had her first experience of that today and was not able to maintain the standards she had set earlier in the fortnight when faced with such persistent pressure. But a run to the quarter-finals means she could well retain her position in the world's top 10. After a few days' rest, Konta is planning to play Fed Cup for Great Britain in Estonia and then rejoin the tour in Doha and Dubai. She has a packed schedule ahead, although may play one or two fewer tournaments if she keeps winning matches at the same rate. Lucic-Baroni won the Australian Open doubles title in 1998 World number 79 Lucic-Baroni upset Pliskova to reach the semi-finals in Melbourne - 18 years after she reached the same stage at Wimbledon. The 34-year-old hardly played in the early years of the centurybecause of a series of personal issues. ""I can't believe this, this is crazy,"" said Lucic-Baroni. ""The only thing I can say is God is good. I can't believe I'm in the semi-finals again. I feel a little bit in shock right now. ""I know this means a lot to every player but to me this is overwhelming, this has truly made my life and everything bad that has happened OK."" Lucic-Baroni was a tennis prodigy, winning junior titles at the Australian and US Opens, and winning the Australian Open doubles with Martina Hingis in 1998. She went on to reach the semi-finals at Wimbledon the following year, losing to Steffi Graf. Lucic-Baroni and Williams will meet for the first time since Wimbledon 1998 in Thursday's semi-final, which begins at 03:00 GMT. ""It is really happening for the mid-30s,"" said Williams. ""Mirjana - it is so good to see her back out and inspiring to see her in the semi-finals. Whatever happens there will be someone in the final in their mid-thirties.""

#OscarsNotQuiteSoWhite,"Dev Patel is nominated for Lion and Viola Davis is nominated for Fences After the #OscarsSoWhite controversies of the last two years, 2017 promises to be a more diverse affair. In the acting categories there are a total of seven nominees from ethnic minority backgrounds. Denzel Washingtonis nominated as best actor for Fences andRuth Neggaas best actress for Loving. Moonlight'sMahershala Aliand Lion'sDev Patelare up for best supporting actor. The supporting actress category includesViola Davisfor Fences,Naomie Harrisfor Moonlight andOctavia Spencerfor Hidden Figures. Moonlight has eight Oscar nominations Three of the nine films up for best picture -Fences,Hidden FiguresandMoonlight- feature predominantly black casts. In Fences, based on August Wilson's play, Washington plays a sanitation worker and former professional baseball player struggling to provide for his family against a backdrop of strained race relations in 1950s Pittsburgh. Hidden Figures is the behind-the-scenes story of three African-American women who helped launch Nasa's first successful space missions in the 1960s. Moonlight is about a gay African-American man grappling with his sexuality in an impoverished neighbourhood of Miami. In the directing category, Moonlight'sBarry Jenkinsis only the fourth black best director nominee in Oscar history. This video can not be played This year, non-white actors have received seven Oscar nominations The first was John Singleton, nominated in 1992 for Boyz n the Hood. He was followed by Lee Daniels, for Precious in 2010, and 12 Years a Slave's Steve McQueen in 2014. McQueen's film won best picture but he lost the best director prize to Gravity's Alfonso Cuaron. In the documentary feature category, Ava DuVernay's13this up againstI Am Not Your Negrofrom Raoul Peck and Ezra Edelman'sOJ: Made In America. (With a running time of seven hours and 47 minutes, OJ is the longest film ever nominated for an Academy Award.) The two-year diversity drought in the acting categories inspiredthe #OscarsSoWhite backlashon social media. Of course, most of this year's nominated films were already in production well before that furore erupted. Moonlight's Jenkins has told the BBC his filmwas not a response to the #OscarsSoWhite criticism, having conceived the project ""at least three-and-a-half years ago"". But the outcry did lead the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which awards the Oscars, to take steps to make its membership more diverse. Ruth Negga in Loving Has that made a difference this year? Hollywood Reporter's Oscars guru Scott Feinberg thinks not. ""The Academy may claim that this is the result of it flooding its organization with an unprecedented number of diverse new members this year, but I maintain that these nominees, up against the same competition, would have been nominated in either of the last two years,""he writes in his Oscars analysis,external. In June 2016, the Academyinvited almost 700 new members to join, with a focus on women and ethnic minorities. One of those new members is British film director Amma Asante, whose film about an interracial marriage A United Kingdom opened the London Film Festival. Shetold me last yearthat the organisers of the Oscars needed to keep up the momentum on its actions to improve diversity. ""I don't know the change happens overnight,"" she said.

Parallel lives,"Aerial performer Jennifer Bricker was born without legs, but she never let it stop her. By the age of 11 she was a gymnastics champion - having fallen in love with the sport after watching Dominique Moceanu win a gold medal for the US at the 1996 Olympics. And it turned out the two had a lot more in common than athletic talent. Wrapped in a loop of red silk suspended from the ceiling Jennifer Bricker climbs and twists to the music. Her head hangs down and her strong arms let go as she balances on her back, high above the ground - a move that's all the more daring because she has no legs. Jennifer was a few months old when she was adopted by Sharon and Gerald Bricker. She had big brown eyes, a radiant smile, and huge amounts of energy. When a doctor advised her adoptive parents to carry her around in a kind of bucket, they refused. Jennifer soon learned to walk - and run - on her hands and bottom, and grew up fearlessly climbing trees and bouncing on the trampoline with her three older brothers. ""They encouraged all of that by having me jump off everything and scare everybody half to death,"" she says. At the age of three she was fitted with prosthetic legs, but she never really took to them - she moved more freely without. At school Jennifer loved competing in ball games. ""I was right there with everyone else,"" she says. ""My parents didn't treat me differently so I didn't grasp the concept that I was different. I knew I didn't have legs but that wasn't stopping me from doing the things I wanted to do."" The Brickers had always been open with her about her adoption. ""I knew that I was Romanian and that probably a good reason why I was given up for adoption was because I didn't have legs,"" says Jennifer. Sharon and Gerald even encouraged her to understand her birth parents - Romanian immigrants to the US who had given her up on the day she was born. ""You didn't walk in their shoes so you really don't know what was going on in their life. They were from a different country. They had a different mindset,"" they would explain. At the same time, they made sure she felt loved and wanted, telling her she was the answer to their prayers. Jennifer grew up in a tiny community in Illinois. The first time she saw a fellow Romanian was on TV. It was 1996 and the Olympic Games were taking place in Atlanta. Jennifer loved to watch the women's gymnastics team, but there was one member of the team she especially idolised - 14-year-old Dominique Moceanu. She was only six years older, and, as Jennifer puts it, ""very small"" like her. ""I was drawn to her because we looked alike and that was so important to me,"" says Jennifer. ""No-one looked like me growing up. I didn't know any other Romanian people. I just saw myself in her in so many ways and that was a big deal for me."" Dominique Moceanu during the Women's Beam event in the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, Georgia Moceanu and the women's team went on to win gold, and it was at that moment Jennifer decided she was going to be a gymnast, too. She took up power tumbling, which involves performing floor exercises down a runway. But Jennifer did not want any allowances to be made for her disability. ""That way when I compete, I know that it's legit,"" she says. She remembers spectators being surprised when they saw her: ""Wow, this girl doesn't have legs - is she competing?"" ""But the love, the support when I did compete was amazing,"" she says. ""They would always applaud and cheer because I made sure that there were no exceptions made for me - nothing."" This video can not be played Video: Watch Jennifer Bricker in action as a champion tumbler At the age of 10 she took part in the Junior Olympics and by age 11 she was tumbling champion for the state of Illinois. Jennifer continued to follow the ups and downs of her idol, who was now making headlines for different reasons. In 1998, when Dominique was 17, she took her parents to court, accusing them of mis-spending $1m of her post-Olympic earnings. During the court case, stories came out about her father's harsh treatment of her. She succeeded in legally breaking free from her parents and taking control of her own finances. Dominique Moceanu takes an oath in court with her father in the background When Jennifer was 16 she asked her mother if there was anything they hadn't told her about her birth family. She really wasn't expecting her to say, ""Yes,"" because her parents had always been so open. But to her surprise, her mother did have something important to tell her. She sat her down and said: ""Your biological last name would have been Moceanu."" There was no doubting what that meant. ""Immediately when she said that I was like, 'Wow, that means Dominique's my sister,'"" says Jennifer. The Brickers had found out purely by accident. Jennifer's was meant to have been a closed adoption, but her birth parents' names appeared on some documents. Then, during the 1996 Olympics, the TV cameras had cut to Dominique's mother Camelia and father Dumitru in the crowd. As their names flashed up on the screen, the Brickers realised they were looking at Jennifer's parents. But they decided not to tell their daughter until she was older. When she found out, Jennifer wanted to get in touch with Dominique, but she was determined to do it properly. ""I couldn't just call her and say 'Hey, I'm your sister' - I didn't want her to think I was crazy."" Her uncle happened to be a private investigator so she asked him to contact her biological parents. They didn't deny putting her up for adoption, but after that first phone call they no longer responded. ""It was clear they wanted to continue keeping me a secret,"" she says. Four years later, Jennifer wrote her sister a letter, explaining the situation and telling her how she had inspired her to take up gymnastics. ""I almost could not believe it myself, you had been my idol my whole life, and you turned out to be my sister!"" she wrote. She included copies of all the documentation she had and lots of photographs - all from the waist up. ""I instinctively made the choice not to tell her I didn't have legs because I thought it might be a little bit much,"" explains Jennifer. ""She's already finding out she has a sister she didn't know about. I'll just wait and tell her about the no legs afterwards."" Listen to Dominique and Jennifer speak toOutlook on the BBC World Service Get the Outlook podcastfor more extraordinary real-life stories By now, Dominique was 26 years old and no longer competing professionally. It was a busy time in her life. She had married a fellow athlete and they were expecting their first child. She was trying to finish her college exams before giving birth. On 10 December 2007, after finishing a statistics exam, Dominique drove to the post office to collect a package. She tore open the envelope when she got back to the car - the first thing she saw were some court documents with her parents' signatures. That piqued her interest. Then she shifted her attention to the photographs of a girl who looked just like her younger sister, Christina. ""The resemblance was unbelievable,"" she says. Finally she turned to the neatly-typed letter. One sentence leapt out at her: ""My biological last name is Moceanu."" ""That letter was the biggest shock of my life and I'll never forget it,"" says Dominique. She needed to know if it was true. Still sitting in her car, she called her mother, who lived a few time zones away, and woke her up with the words: ""Did you give up a baby girl for adoption in 1987?"" ""She had the wake-up call of her life - it was just so blunt,"" she admits. Her mother burst into tears. She said ""Yes"" but could barely say anything else. ""My heart broke for her because she had to keep this a secret for all these years and she could never have had the opportunity to deal with it,"" says Dominique. The next few weeks were an emotional rollercoaster. Dominique wrote back to Jennifer, asking for time to process the news and explaining that she was about to have a baby. ""I needed to answer some of my own questions and figure out how this could have happened,"" says Dominique. At the time her father was very ill so it was difficult to communicate with him, but Dominique found out that he had made the decision to give Jennifer up at the hospital out of fear that they would not be able to pay her medical bills. Her mother had not had a say in it, and had never even got the chance to hold her. Jennifer Bricker as a one-year-old Dominique's own daughter was born on Christmas Day and a few weeks later, on 14 January, she felt ready to call her sister for the first time. She was nervous and had even prepared notes, but the conversation soon flowed. Then Jennifer bit the bullet. ""By the way, you know I don't have legs right?"" she said. Dominique was stunned into silence. How did this fit with what she knew? ""She told me that I was the reason she started gymnastics, and I thought that was a beautiful thing,"" says Dominique. ""I never imagined she would do all of these sports without having legs."" That spring, Dominique, Jennifer and their younger sister Christina met for the first time in Ohio, where Dominique lived. Dominique Moceanu (left), Christina Moceanu and Jennifer Bricker (right) ""On one hand it was surreal and a bit like a dream,"" says Jennifer. ""But on the other hand it was very natural. The DNA was very clear at that point. When I met my younger sister it was like looking in a mirror."" The sisters marvelled at all the things they had in common - the way they laughed, even certain hand gestures - but when they spoke about their upbringing, their stories could not have been more different. ""They did not have the love and support that I had. They had some abuse and turmoil and secrets so it was not an easy childhood for them,"" says Jennifer. The Moceanus, themselves former gymnasts, had come to the US in 1981, after fleeing the Ceausescu regime in Romania. Dominique was born shortly after they arrived, and they dreamed she would be the next Nadia Comaneci. When she was six months old they hung her on the washing line to test her strength - she held on until the line broke. ""That was a sign to them I'd be a great gymnast,"" says Dominique. It was a story her father loved to tell - unfortunately the training methods he and the coaches espoused were a hangover from the communist era. Dominique says she was constantly humiliated and berated about her weight and any shortcomings in her performance. ""People thought these measures were the way you had to succeed,"" she says. ""But those kinds of things are really damaging to the self-esteem when you're a young, growing, pre-pubescent child."" There was also the threat of physical punishment from her father if her performance was not up to scratch. He was an authoritarian figure who dominated the household. ""We all agree that it would not have been a great childhood environment for me to grow up in,"" says Jennifer. ""My parents had never been around many children with disabilities,"" says Dominique. Their father died before Jennifer could meet him, but in January 2010, at the age of 22, she met her biological mother, Camelia, for the first time. ""I remember it in slow motion,"" says Jennifer. ""She was wearing a fur hat - it was such a stereotypical Eastern European thing. ""She couldn't believe how much I looked like my sisters and so she was instinctively speaking in Romanian."" Dominique had to translate for her mother, who was too stunned to switch to English. The women hugged, and Jennifer showed her videos of her performances, including a trampoline act she had performed on tour with Britney Spears. ""She was so amazed and she knew that she could have never given me that life,"" she says. Jennifer felt no anger towards her. She credits her adoptive parents for this. ""They gave me the freedom not to be bitter,"" she says. Jennifer with her parents, Sharon and Gerald Bricker In fact, she says her heart went out to her mother. ""You know, my biological mother was very much a victim of an abusive marriage,"" she says. ""She did not have an easy life - and that's not me making an excuse for her, that's just the truth."" The sisters live in separate states but try to see each other when they can, making up for lost time. Jennifer now travels the world as an inspirational speaker and performs as an aerial acrobat. ""She's wonderful, she's up there in the air and you can see her passion,"" says Dominique. ""I'm proud of her as an older sister - she's really living her dreams.""

Volunteers signed up to cuddle babies,"Vulnerable babies born addicted to painkillers or heroin are being soothed through their first difficult weeks by volunteers whose sole task is simply to cuddle them. Programmes in hospitals and care facilities across the US have been inundated by people keen to offer physical comfort to the infants as they go through the withdrawal process. Numerous studies have shown the benefits of human physical contact, and medical staff have found that recruiting volunteers to hold and snuggle up to babies - perhaps singing or whispering to them - has a positive effect on the newborns. Many babies spend weeks or months in hospital as they are gradually weaned off the drugs they have been exposed to in their mothers' wombs. Sometimes they are not with their parents, or their mothers are spending many hours each day attending drug rehabilitation programmes. ""These babies need to feel love, human touch and a soft voice to comfort them when they're in pain,"" says Maryann Malloy, a nurse manager for the neonatal intensive care unit at Einstein Medical Center in Philadelphia. ""It makes the parents feel better knowing that even when they cannot be here there is someone to rock and hold their baby."" ""It is a helpless feeling when these babies become inconsolable. ""Our cuddlers help so the babies do not reach that point. They pick them up before the first whimper."" The babies are suffering from Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS) as a result of their mothers using prescription painkillers and drugs like heroin or methadone. Their symptoms will vary depending on what drugs the mother was taking but can include excessive crying, fever, irritability, rapid breathing, seizures, sleep problems, trembling, vomiting and sweating. Having volunteers available to cuddle babies also has reduces both the amount of medication babies need and their length of stay in baby units, doctors have noted. Some babies have also shown other improvements, such as gaining weight more quickly. Recruiting cuddlers to help look after vulnerable infants is now a widespread practice in the US. It has been used by some institutions dating back to the 1980s for premature babies and those born to crack-addicted mothers. However, the problem of babies born with NAS in the USappears to be growing,external. A 2013 report showed a greater number of women were using prescribed painkillers during pregnancy and also a general increase in prescription painkiller abuse. According to theNational Institute on Drug Abuse,externalone baby every 25 minutes is born with NAS. ThePennsylvania Health Care Cost Containment Council reported,externalthat in its region alone the rate of newborn hospital stays for substance-abuse problems soared 250 percent from 2000 to 2015, when almost 20 out of every 1,000 newborns faced withdrawal issues. Similar volunteer programmes are run across the US. The Thomas Jefferson University Hospital, in Philadelphia, has a four-hour training course for its cuddlers. Once vetted and trained the volunteers put in three-hour supervised shifts. The Boston Medical Center also has a program called CALM - Cuddling Assists in Lowering Maternal and Infant Stress. So many people have signed up to the Jefferson cuddling programme that their books are closed now to new volunteers until the middle of the year. Those still keen to help are advised to look up local women and children's shelters, which often provide services for mothers battling addiction.

The Brexit court case ruling explained,"It's done. The Supreme Court has ruled and plotted a course towards Brexit. Amid all the division and rancour over leaving the EU, they have set out how power in the UK is separated between ministers who govern, Parliament that legislates, the devolved bodies that administer parts of the UK and lastly the role of judges in arbitrating between everyone. In essence, the judgement is quite simple because it says that it's for Parliament, not ministers, to change the constitution of the UK. At the heart of this case was the question of what the 1972 European Communities Act, that took the UK into what's now the EU, amounted to. The government argued it was a pipeline down which EU law flowed. Ministers have the power to make and break treaties - that's always been the case. And they argued the 1972 Act is the UK's method of turning the EU treaty into practical law - such as regulations on consumer rights or freedom of movement. But eight of the 11 justices disagreed.In their judgement,external, the majority said the EU law that has poured into the UK through the 1972 Act has become part of the law of our lands. ""One of the fundamental functions of the constitution of any state is to identify the sources of its law,"" said the judgement. ""The 1972 Act effectively constitutes EU law as an entirely new, independent and overriding source of domestic law. Withdrawal... will constitute as significant a constitutional change as that which occurred [when the UK joined]. ""It would be inconsistent with long-standing and fundamental principle for such a far-reaching change to the UK constitutional arrangements to be brought about by ministerial decision or ministerial action alone. ""All the more so when the source in question was brought into existence by Parliament through primary legislation, which gave that source an overriding supremacy in the hierarchy of domestic law sources."" The justices went on to say that leaving the EU wasn't just a case of shredding the membership card. Leaving would involve removing existing domestic rights of UK residents which came from being part of the club. The 11 Supreme Court justices (pictured with Lord Toulson - top row, far left - who is now retired) rejected the government's argument by eight to three Those rights have changed over four decades as ministers have agreed new deals at summits and the union has evolved. But the justices said that the 1972 Act never envisaged those rights could be removed entirely on the whim of a minister following an advisory referendum. This, again, is a matter for Parliament to decide. Now, the government further argued that ministers had the power to take us out of the EU because Parliament had not taken it away. This is an argument about the balance of power between Parliament and ministers which dates back 300 years. But the Supreme Court majority rejected that out of hand because, turning the issue on its head, they said that Parliament could have explicitly told ministers they had the power to trigger Article 50. But where are those words to be found in our law? They don't exist. And if those words don't exist, the power to change the constitution lies with Parliament. What about devolution? Here, the government won hands down. It may look today like something of a pointless victory, given they lost on the fundamental point - but in years to come this judgement will become a key in disputes relating to the complicated jigsaw of how the UK is now governed. In the justice's judgement, the majority said that the EU law that has poured into the UK through the 1972 Act has become part of the law of our lands Firstly, the justices said that while Scottish Parliament and Welsh and Northern Ireland Assemblies had a role in administering EU rules and law (for example, in relation to agriculture) they have no constitutional role in making or breaking the international treaties that lie behind those responsibilities. So what about consulting them? The so-called ""Sewel Convention"" says that government in London will normally consult devolved bodies before passing a law that affects the powers they already exercise. Westminster could come up with all sorts of new laws that affect Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland - but in practice it has promised to *normally* not do so without speaking to them first. And that's the point, say the justices, it's just an assurance - it's not a legally-binding obligation on London. And if it's not a law, the Supreme Court has no role in deciding its workings. That will be a huge blow to Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon's attempts to force Prime Minister Theresa May to cut some kind of unique deal. She's said today there is a ""clear political obligation"" to consult and Scotland's voice ""is simply not being heard"". But the brutal reality is that while there may be political fireworks between Downing Street and Holyrood, the law says London can, quite simply, just get on with Brexit whether the SNP or other parties in the nations like it or not. So on to Northern Ireland: does it have a unique status? Well yes and no. The justices said the Good Friday or Belfast Agreement in 1998 did indeed give its people a lock over their future - but not in this context. The court said: ""In our view this important provision which rose out of the Belfast Agreement gave the people of Northern Ireland the right to determine whether to remain part of the UK or to become part of a united Ireland. ""It neither regulated any other change in the constitutional status of Northern Ireland nor required the consent of a majority of the people of Northern Ireland to the withdrawal of the UK from the EU."" It's now up to ministers to decide what kind of Bill to put before Parliament. It could be very short. ""What form such legislation should take is entirely a matter for Parliament,"" said the justices. ""There is no equivalence between the constitutional importance of a statute, or any other document, and its length or complexity. ""A notice [triggering Article 50] could no doubt be very short indeed, but that would not undermine its momentous significance. ""The essential point is that, if, as we consider, what would otherwise be a prerogative act would result in a change in domestic law, the act can only lawfully be carried out with the sanction of primary legislation enacted by the Queen in Parliament."" It's now up to ministers to decide what kind of Bill to put before Parliament One last point. During the hearing in December, one of the counsel sarcastically quipped that the only reason why everybody was in court was because nobody in government thought there would be a vote to leave. Amid the legal jargon of the judgement, the justices appear sympathetic to that view. ""The effect of any particular referendum must depend on the terms of the statute [law] which authorises it,"" they wrote. ""[Past] legislation authorising a referendum more often than not has provided for the consequences on that result."" The 2015 European Union Referendum Act made no such plans. The subtext of the entire judgement? Former Prime Minister David Cameron really should have thought about what-happens-next and written it into the referendum bill he presented to Parliament.

What happens now?,"The Supreme Court has dismissed the government's appeal in a landmark case about Brexit, meaning Parliament will be required to give its approval before official talks on leaving the EU can begin. The ruling is a significant, although not totally unexpected, setback for Theresa May. What will the prime minister do next and what impact will the ruling have on the process of leaving the EU, following last year's referendum vote? The highest court in the UK dismissed the government's argument that it has the power to begin official Brexit negotiations with the rest of the EU without Parliament's prior agreement. By a margin of eight to three, the 11 justices upheld November's High Court ruling which stated that it would be unlawful for the government to rely on executive powers known as the royal prerogative to implement the outcome of last year's referendum. It said a law would have to be passed to authorise Article 50 but the precise form such legislation should take was ""entirely a matter"" for Parliament. Attorney General Jeremy Wright said the government would ""comply with the judgement of the court and do all that is necessary to implement it"". In a statement to Parliament setting out details of the government's legislative response, David Davis said he intended to publish an outline bill ""within days"". The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the details could be announced as early as Thursday, with a view to staging the first vote next week and getting it through the Commons within a couple of weeks. We will get more details from the government later this week, with draft legislation already said to have been prepared in preparation for the appeal being rejected. The new bill is expected to be short, with the government's lawyer suggesting during the hearing that ""one-line"" legislation could be put forward. Both the House of Commons and House of Lords will have to vote in favour of it. Separately, the government has agreed to produce an official policy document known as a White Paper explaining its objectives for the upcoming Brexit negotiations. Ministers initially resisted the move, saying it would take too long, but Theresa May has agreed to it. The concession is being seen as a victory for opposition parties and a group of former Tory ministers who oppose a so-called ""hard Brexit"" and want to examine the government's plans in greater detail. The bill will be given special priority by Parliament, whose order of business is still largely controlled by ministers. While Tory MPs would like to see it fast-tracked through Parliament, many Labour, Lib Dem and SNP MPs will want as much time as possible to discuss a variety of issues and to make amendments. The SNP responded to the ruling by saying it would table 50 ""serious and substantive"" amendments. Labour said it too would seek to amend the bill but would not ""frustrate"" the Brexit process. However it pans out, BBC Parliamentary correspondent Mark D'Arcy says the bill could pass through the Commons before the half-term recess in the middle of February, giving ample time for the Lords to then consider it and for it to become law before the end of March. While there are some MPs who want the process to be delayed, they are vastly outnumbered by those who want the government to get on with it so that the UK will have left the EU by the time of the next election - scheduled for May 2020. In theory, yes there is. But in reality it is extremely unlikely to happen. Few, if any, Conservative MPs are likely to vote against Article 50. In fact, only one - the europhile former chancellor Ken Clarke - has said he will do so. Given that the Tories have a working majority of 15 in the Commons, this means that the bill is guaranteed to pass - especially since a majority of Labour MPs have said they will not stand in the way of the process and many will actually vote for Article 50. Although the Lib Dems, the SNP and some Labour MPs are likely to vote against, this will make little difference. What will be more interesting is if a coalition of pro-European Conservatives and opposition MPs join forces to win concessions, over the extent of Parliamentary scrutiny of the two-year process. Events in the Lords - where the government does not have a working majority and there are 178 non-affiliated cross-bench peers - could be more unpredictable. Mark D'Arcy says there are murmurings of an organised attempt to resist Article 50 and a ""doomed last stand"" by diehard Remainers. But amid warnings that any attempt to block Brexit could trigger a general election, in which the future of the Lords would be a major issue - it is likely that the skirmishes will amount to just that and the government will eventually get its way. The Supreme Court case wasn't just a battle over the powers of the executive and the legislature. The justices heard a number of separate but related challenges to the government's Brexit approach, centred around the involvement of the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. But the court unanimously ruled that devolved administrations did not need to be consulted, and did not have a right to veto Article 50. The government has previously said Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will be kept fully involved.

Brighton & Hove Albion 1-0 Cardiff City,"Brighton have won 11 of their 14 home league games this season, losing just once at the Amex Stadium Brighton went back to the top of the Championship thanks to Tomer Hemed's winner against a determined Cardiff. Chris Hughton's side were dominant in the second half but had to wait until the 73rd minute when Oliver Norwood found Hemed who fired home. The visiting Bluebirds had threatened in the first period, but David Stockdale denied Kenneth Zohore. The match had been rearranged after the scheduled meeting on 30 December waspostponed because of fog. Tuesday's EFL action as it happened Cardiff remain 16th in the Championship while Brighton hold a two-point advantage over Newcastle. The Seagulls made a fast start and could have led after four minutes, but winger Jamie Murphy could not quite connect with a cross. Joe Ralls went close with Cardiff's first effort and Zohore spurned a good opportunity when he raced clear on 23 minutes before firing straight at David Stockdale. The visitors again went close through Sean Morrison who headed firmly at goal from Ralls' free-kick, but Stockdale tipped the ball over the bar. The goalkeeper was again called into action when Junior Hoilett cut inside and fired at goal, but Stockdale produced a fingertip stop to turn the ball wide. Brighton did test Allan McGregor just before the break when Solly March broke clear, but his effort was held by the on-loan goalkeeper. However, if Cardiff shaded the first period, the promotion-chasing hosts were dominant after the restart. Hughton's men wasted one of the best opportunities of the match when Israel international Hemed missed from close range after March's cross. Tomer Hemed has scored five goals is 21 league appearances for Brighton this season The longer the game stayed level the more Cardiff attempted to frustrate, but Brighton got their breakthrough when substitute Norwood found Hemed, who turned past defender Sol Bamba and smashed the ball into the net. Murphy almost made it two only a minute later after Connor Goldson's cut-back, but McGregor denied him. Anthony Knockaert also missed a late chance to increase the advantage. Brighton held on despite a late effort from substitute Craig Noone that was blocked. The defeat for Neil Warnock's side was the first time Cardiff have lost a league game away at Brighton since January 2002, when Bobby Zamora netted the winner for the Seagulls. Brighton boss Chris Hughton told BBC Sussex:""They've got good players in their team and we had to be patient and look for the opportunities. ""I think you've got to give them credit, but it was going to be that one bit of brilliance or one bit of really good play that was going to break the deadlock, and I always felt it was going to be us rather than them. ""The league is too tough to be able to expect anything different than what we expect, and that's everybody behind us in the table really pushing."" Cardiff City boss Neil Warnock told BBC Radio Wales:""I asked the players to show how far we have come and I thought we more than matched them at times. ""It shows me what we are looking for and what we need to succeed. ""I think Brighton will be glad that they don't play us again. We had good chances and their goalkeeper has made three good saves.""

Do you know who I am?," Monday 23rd January 2017 As a theme for a piece of music or song, mistaken identity has been well-used over time - byMozartin his operas,Bob Dylanin It Ain't Me Be,The Kinksin Lola, and byWu-Tang Clanin a track literally called Mistaken Identity. But what of actual mistaken identity in the world of music? There have been many amusing cases from all fields; here are half a dozen of our favourites. [Warning: The BBC is not responsible for the content of external websites] [LISTEN] BBC Radio 4 - Tupac Shakur: Hip Hop Immortal For music fans, Christmas 2016 was overshadowed by the deaths ofStatus Quo'sRick ParfittandGeorge Michael. But there was one story that spread across the internet on Christmas Day providing a bit of light relief - news that a Sri Lankan church had accidentally printed the lyrics of late rapperTupac Shakur's Hail Mary in its Christmas service programme instead of the 15th century Catholic prayer. Asthe Independent reported: ""The mix-up occurred at the 2016 Catholic Joy to the World Festival at the Colombo's Nelum Pokuna Theatre during one of Sri Lanka's largest Christmas celebrations earlier this month. Instead of finding the words 'Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee / blessed art thou amongst women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb', the carol singers were invited to reflect on the 1997 song's themes of mortality, violence and sex and whether they wanted to 'ride or die'."" Shaun Ryder's 2011 autobiography Twisting My Melon is a mine of classic anecdotes from his days in theHappy Mondaysand beyond, including this one... It was 1989, the Mondays had just released their Madchester Rave On EP and they were on their biggest tour yet. Newcastle was the second date and Sean was late to leave Manchester for the gig. He arrived at Newcastle station with the group's manager Anthony 'Muzzer' Murray, then they hailed a cab and asked to be taken to ""the local gig venue"", where they hoped to find the rest of the band. Ryder: ""We ran up to the door and Muzzer was giving it, 'We're in the band, we're in the band... we're late,' and the bouncers just let us through and we legged it in. We waked through the auditorium, and should have clocked then that it was quite a civilised crowd... but we didn't. We just jumped on stage, and as I was walking across the stage I clocked the instruments and thought, 'We haven't got a saxophone,' but it still didn't click, and I just thought it was the support band's or something. ""Then we saw the dressing room door andMick Hucknallwas standing there with the rest ofSimply Redand I suddenly realised. 'F***! Wrong f****** venue!' We had turned up at a Simply Red gig. We were actually playing the Poly, which was just round the corner, so we did one sharpish."" Badly Drawn Boy, Damon Gough, was a musician on the make in 1997 - he'd released his first EP, but he was three years away from winning the 2000Mercury Prizewith his debut album, The Hour of Bewilderbeast. He was living in Manchester and specifically not working as a taxi driver. But that didn't stopThe Fall's Mark E. Smith coming out of the Night and Day Café and mistaking him for one. Smith needed to get to Stockport and, courteously, Gough obliged, believing it would be a good opportunity to persuade Smith to record one of his songs. Smith left his false teeth in Gough's car, which Gough kept. Then in 2001, Smith told Q magazine: ""I also left a bloody expensive leather jacket that he has not returned... about 110 quid. I haven't had that back. He can keep the teeth, though.""

Viceflagged it up in 2008 when Cameron was leader of the Conservative Party and it went viral, forcing Tory HQ to ""categorically"" deny that the raver was Dave, although he didn't start work at their Conservative Research Department until six months after the footage was recorded. Official word, then: it's a doppelgänger, which makes sense. The famous Bullingdon Club picture of Cameron, in which he has much shorter hair, is from 1987.

[LISTEN] BBC Radio 6 Music - Producer Steve Levine on Primal Scream's Rocks As a band statement, it pulled no punches: ""Primal Scream are totally disgusted that the Home Secretary Theresa May ended her speech at the Tory party conference with our song Rocks. How inappropriate. Didn't they research the political history of our band? Hasn't she listened to the words? Does she even know what getting your rocks off means? No. She is a Tory; how could she?"" It was October 2011, and someone had toldPrimal Screamthat the current PM had walked off stage at her party conference to their 1994 hit. It sounded like a tall tale (lyrics include: ""Dealers keep dealin', thieves keep thievin'"") and it turned out to be untrue - May hadn't used the song at all; she'd played the equally surprising 2001 track Bohemian Like You byThe Dandy Warhols, the controversial video for which contains full-frontal male and topless female nudity.

Unseeded Lucic-Baroni through to semis,"This video can not be played Konta values Australian Open experience Australian Open 2017 Venue:Melbourne Park, MelbourneDates:16-29 Jan Coverage:Daily live commentary on BBC Radio 5 live sports extra; live text on selected matches on the BBC Sport website; TV highlights on BBC Two and online from 21 January. Six-time champion Serena Williams outplayed Britain's Johanna Konta to reach the Australian Open semi-finals. The American, 35, won 6-2 6-3 and will next play unseeded CroatMirjana Lucic-Baroni,who beat fifth-seeded Czech Karolina Pliskova 6-4 3-6 6-4. Konta, seeded ninth, went into the quarter-final on a nine-match and 18-set winning streak but came up short in her first meeting with Williams. Williams is now two wins from claiming an Open-era record 23rd major title. Watch day 10 highlights on BBC Two from 16:45 GMT on Wednesday Nadal beats Raonic to reach semi-finals Latest Australian Open scores & schedule ""Johanna Konta has been playing so well,"" said the second seed. ""I was in the locker room watching her clean up her matches. She is a future champion here for sure, so I am pleased to get through this. ""I got a little frustrated with my serve, but I told myself 'don't get Babyrena' [Williams' angry alter-ego] and focused on enjoying myself out here. Today I felt I can do this, it is such a great opportunity for me."" Konta described facing Williams as the""best experience of my life"". Konta had not dropped a set in her past nine matches before facing Williams In a match of big hitting and small margins, it was Williams who established an early control she would not relinquish. The American's usually dominant first serve faltered as she made just 45%, but she returned brilliantly to break the Konta serve - the best on tour this season going into the match - four times. Konta had the first chance but went long with a backhand on break point at 1-1, then found her second serve under greater pressure than at any stage of the tournament so far. Williams looked razor sharp on return, with two thumping forehand winners setting the American on the way to a 3-1 lead. More heavy blows brought a second break, and with it the set, in game eight to end a run of 18 straight sets for Konta stretching back to herwarm-up win in Sydney. Konta showed why she had been seen as a real threat by recovering from 0-40 early in the second set and then breaking to lead 3-1, but a loose game handed the advantage back and Williams raced through five straight games to victory. BBC tennis correspondent Russell Fuller No matter how many times you have watched Serena Williams play, it is perhaps just not possible to appreciate how hard she hits the ball - and how quickly it arrives on your racquet - until you have shared a court with her. Johanna Konta had her first experience of that today and was not able to maintain the standards she had set earlier in the fortnight when faced with such persistent pressure. But a run to the quarter-finals means she could well retain her position in the world's top 10. After a few days' rest, Konta is planning to play Fed Cup for Great Britain in Estonia and then rejoin the tour in Doha and Dubai. She has a packed schedule ahead, although may play one or two fewer tournaments if she keeps winning matches at the same rate. Lucic-Baroni won the Australian Open doubles title in 1998 World number 79 Lucic-Baroni upset Pliskova to reach the semi-finals in Melbourne - 18 years after she reached the same stage at Wimbledon. The 34-year-old hardly played in the early years of the centurybecause of a series of personal issues. ""I can't believe this, this is crazy,"" said Lucic-Baroni. ""The only thing I can say is God is good. I can't believe I'm in the semi-finals again. I feel a little bit in shock right now. ""I know this means a lot to every player but to me this is overwhelming, this has truly made my life and everything bad that has happened OK."" Lucic-Baroni was a tennis prodigy, winning junior titles at the Australian and US Opens, and winning the Australian Open doubles with Martina Hingis in 1998. She went on to reach the semi-finals at Wimbledon the following year, losing to Steffi Graf. Lucic-Baroni and Williams will meet for the first time since Wimbledon 1998 in Thursday's semi-final, which begins at 03:00 GMT. ""It is really happening for the mid-30s,"" said Williams. ""Mirjana - it is so good to see her back out and inspiring to see her in the semi-finals. Whatever happens there will be someone in the final in their mid-thirties.""

Orla Guerin: PPaying the price for seeking freedom in Egypt,"Mahmoud Hussein says he needs a crutch because of abuse and medical neglect in prison It is six years since the outbreak of the 18-day revolution in Egypt which swept the autocrat, Hosni Mubarak, from power. But human rights campaigners say the situation in the country is now far worse than before the uprising, as Orla Guerin reports from Cairo. With every step he takes, Mahmoud Mohammed Hussein is reminded of the price he paid for wanting freedom and democracy in Egypt. The 21-year-old has a pronounced limp and relies on a crutch - a legacy, he says, of beatings during almost 800 days in a series of prisons. Ten months have passed since his release, but he still appears frail. Mahmoud is one of thousands who have been detained in recent years under Egypt's latest strongman, President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi. As army chief he led the military overthrow of Egypt's first democratically-elected president, Mohammed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood, in 2013. Since then Mr Sisi has presided over a sweeping crackdown on dissent - ensnaring Islamists, liberals, journalists, aid workers, and icons of the revolution of 2011. People took to the streets of Cairo on 25 January 2011 to demand Hosni Mubarak resign Mahmoud joined the throngs behind bars back in 2014, when he was just 18. His ordeal began on 25 January, the anniversary of the outbreak of the revolution. His fate was sealed by his T-shirt which read: ""A nation without torture."" ""It was a day of celebration for me,"" said Mahmoud, who has dark curly hair and a ready smile. ""I wasn't part of the revolution, but I believed in it and its goals. It made me feel like a human being, with rights and duties. ""Nowadays, people see the anniversary as a black day, they worry when it comes. For me the mood was one of celebration."" Supporters of Abdul Fattah al-Sisi were allowed to take to the streets on 25 January 2014 But then - as now - the streets were reserved for President Sisi's supporters. They could gather freely, unlike his critics. Protests are virtually banned here. We witnessed police opening fire that day - with live rounds - on unarmed demonstrators. Mahmoud said he was not involved in any of the protests, but that he was detained as he headed for home. ""The officer who arrested me told me, 'You have my picture on your T-shirt',"" he said. ""The T-shirt was inspired by the revolution. I saw it as a beautiful thing, not a crime. A country without torture is a dream that everyone wishes for."" Dozens died in clashes with security forces at anti-government protests three years ago That dream was apparently not shared by the police he encountered that day. Mahmoud said they soon employed the torture skills for which human rights groups have long condemned the Egyptian police. ""I was abused at the checkpoint where I was arrested,"" he told us. ""Then they transferred me to the police station. I was electrocuted on my private parts. They kicked me with their military boots, and hit me with sticks. ""Everyone knew I was there because of the T-shirt. They believed this was a personal insult to them, so they beat me."" The aim, he said, was to get him to sign a false confession. Mahmoud Hussein (centre) was photographed with the T-shirt reading ""A nation without torture"" ""A senior officer beat me and kicked me and then asked junior police officers to do the job,"" he said. ""They wanted me to sign a report saying I was against the police. I refused. The juniors have their own ways - if beating doesn't work, then electrocution might do the job. ""I was stripped naked, without even boxer shorts, and I was beaten just to admit to certain charges"". Mahmoud asked the officers to spare his leg, which was injured in the past. ""They insisted on kicking me and beating me on that leg,"" he said. ""Because of all the abuse and the medical neglect in prison I now need my friend, the crutch, and two surgeries."" His account is consistent with testimony from others who have been detained in recent years. We asked the Egyptian government for a response to the allegation that detainees have been beaten and tortured in custody. There was no reply. In the past the authorities have denied there is systematic torture, but said there may be individual cases. Mahmoud faces charges including joining a banned terrorist group - something he denies Mahmoud described both physical and psychological abuse. He told us he spent 14 months in one overcrowded cell where he could barely move, and could not see daylight. There were about 150 other prisoners, including Islamists and men held for rape and murder. ""I always had this element of fear,"" he said, ""All the time, because prison is like a tomb. It's a place that takes away your soul, and kills everything beautiful in you."" Tens of thousands of people have been jailed in a sweeping crackdown on dissent since 2013 Mahmoud was released from detention last March - following campaigns at home and abroad. While he is back home with his family in Cairo, he is not completely free. He still faces charges including joining an unauthorized protest, possession of explosives and joining a banned terrorist group - all of which he denies. ""I could go back to prison at any time,"" he said. ""They could just pick me walking on the street. ""Since my release that has happened twice. I was held for a few hours and then they let me go."" Public criticism and peaceful opposition are effectively banned in Egypt, rights activists say Mahmoud has also been receiving threatening phone calls. ""One told me I would not have time to come back to prison,"" he said, ""meaning that someone could stab me or kill me. I didn't reply. I just hung up."" In spite of all the dangers, including the risk that he could be put on trial, Mahmoud refuses to be silenced. ""In Egypt my rights and the rights of thousands of others like me are violated, just for dreaming or hoping for freedom,"" he said. ""Their destiny is prison, or death. That's not going to stop me from speaking out, or caring for thousands like me. "" Officials here would not give us a comment on allegations that all dissent is being crushed. President Sisi said in September that ""there can be no return to dictatorship"" President Sisi has said in the past that stability is more important than freedom, but he maintains that dictatorship cannot return to Egypt. Critics believe in some key respects it never left. When asked if the revolution is now dead, Mahmoud gave a swift response. ""No, not at all,"" he insisted. ""25 January is a dream that will never die. The revolution lives in the hearts of people like me, of everyone who believes in it. ""The current regime is trying desperately to erase it from memory."" As for the T- shirt that cost him his freedom, he has no regrets. ""I always say that if I could go back, in spite of all the abuses I suffered, I would wear the T-shirt again,"" he said.
