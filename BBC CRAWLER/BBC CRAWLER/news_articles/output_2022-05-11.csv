"World complacent on Covid, warns Gordon Brown","Mr Brown said political leaders are not listening to medical advice Gordon Brown has warned that the world risks ""sleepwalking"" into another Covid variant crisis if it does not increase vaccinations in low-income countries. Wealthier countries needed to share the cost of global vaccinations, tests and treatments, he told the BBC. Speaking before an international Covid summit on Thursday, the former UK prime minister said the world had become ""complacent"" about the virus. US President Joe Biden is due to host the virtual summit at the White House. He does so at a time when Congress has failed to approve key funds earmarked for the global pandemic response. Campaigners fear that could mean other countries will not offer extra money either, leaving the push for better vaccine coverage around the world without momentum. Mr Brown, who is a World Health Organization (WHO) ambassador on health finance, said the numbers were ""shocking"". ""Only 11% have been vaccinated in low-income countries and we set a target of 70%,"" he said. ""Tragically, we are sleepwalking into the next variant, and political leaders are still not listening to the medical advice that is still there - that we've got to increase vaccination, continue to test at a high level, and provide the new treatments available."" Mr Brown said that if wealthy countries did not pay for what is needed now, they might face huge economic costs later if a more lethal variant emerges in low-income countries and is detected too late. He also said daily testing in poorer countries was only averaging five tests per 100,000 people, rather than the goal of 100 per 100,000, as suggested by the WHO. Congress has so far been reluctant to approve extra funds of $5bn (Â£4bn) for international vaccination programmes. Mr Brown and other former leaders have written to Mr Biden urging the United States to keep up the momentum on the global vaccination push. Mr Brown said: ""I think the Americans have forgotten that if they take no action, then the virus will spread from places that are least vaccinated and least protected, and it will come back to haunt them - even if they've been vaccinated four times."" The WHO says there's a $15bn financing gap which richer countries need to fill collectively if the developing world is to have the right tools to fight the pandemic properly. But pressure groups are not expecting countries like the UK to allocate any more money than it has already. In Africa, more than 45 faith leaders have also called for ""immediate action to address the massive inequalities in the global pandemic response"". In a joint statement, the religious leaders point out that only one in five Africans has received their first dose of vaccine, while high-income countries are rolling out third and fourth doses. The Archbishop of Cape Town, Thabo Makgoba, is one of those urging world politicians ""not to see this as just a number, but as a reminder that each statistic represents a human being who deserves dignity and the ability to thrive in a post-pandemic world"".

'Critical mass' of polluters set carbon targets,"A record number of big polluters are committing to cutting CO2 emissions, a UN-backed report has said. But firms in Asia, Africa and Latin America are lagging behind Europe, the US and Japan, the Science-Based Targets Initiative said. Separately, a report cast doubt on whether oil companies can all deliver carbon cuts they've promised. Big oil firms are relying on unproven technologies, a think tank said. The Science-Based Targets Initiative advises firms on how to set emissions reduction targets in line with climate science. It says targets have now been adopted by more than 2,000 firms worth $38tn across 70 countries in 15 industries. The authors say that in the most polluting sectors a critical mass of firms (27%) has joined the initiative. They believe this could prove a positive tipping point, as the polluting giants influence actions across the whole supply chain. More than half the companies setting targets are in the G7 rich nations, but there are also participants from China, India, Brazil, South Korea and South Africa. Canada and Italy are lagging behind, the report says. And Africa and Asia need more participants. The document says: Around 80% of the targets approved by the firms in 2021 were aligned with the benchmark of holding global temperature rises to 1.5ÂºC above pre-industrial times. Between 2015-2020, the majority of companies with 1.5Â°C targets cut emissions twice as fast as required. Environmentalist Tom Burke from the think tank E3G welcomed the target setting. ""This is really good news"", he said, ""but it's very late in the day. We are way past the time when we should be tackling climate change. ""It's great to have targets but there's a huge gap in government and business between targets and achievements"". A separate report today urged caution over oil companies' targets. The think tank Carbon Tracker said that oil and gas firms are basing their emissions goals on either selling polluting assets or on unproven or controversial technologies. These include carbon capture and storage (CCS) - or carbon offsetting which can include trees being planted to compensate for industrial emissions. Carbon Tracker says investors should ask whether companies' targets are not just ambitious but also credible. The author, Mike Coffin, said: ""Emissions mitigation technologies pose a huge risk to investors and the climate because most, such as CCS, are at an early stage of development, and solutions involving tree-planting require vast areas of land. ""Costs will be enormous and it is not clear whether they will be technically feasible or economically viable."" The report ranks oil and gas firms. It says: Enihas the strongest policy, pledging a 35% cut in emissions by 2030 from the production and use of its products. But its plans involve CCS and nature-based solutions such as tree planting. BPranks fourth but its position is expected to improve once it formally ends its Rosneft gas shareholding. It says CCS will be a ""lever"" for emissions reductions. Shellranks fifth, pledging only to reduce the carbon intensity of its operations and the products it sells. Nine North American companies all have weaker policies than Europeans and only commit to reducing emissions intensity - that's a measure of carbon emissions per dollar earned. ExxonMobilhas the weakest policy, the report says. It adopted a net zero target last year but has not said how it will get there. However, the oil giant said that it ""has long acknowledged the reality and risks of climate change, and it has devoted significant resources to addressing those risks"". ""We have announced our ambition to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions for operated assets by 2050. As part of that, we are developing detailed emission-reduction roadmaps for major facilities and assets,"" it said. A Met Office report this week said new global record temperatures are expected again in the next few years.

Watchdog highlights 'precarious state' of nature,"A report from an independent watchdog says it's very concerned about the ""precarious state"" of England's environment. The Office for Environmental Protection says that existing laws are failing to slow the damage to land, air and water. Protecting the environment should have the same urgency as efforts to reach net zero emissions, the study says. The government says current laws will make a real difference and put nature on the road to recovery this decade. 'Fifty-fifty chance' global warming tops 1.5C soon What will Australia's election mean for the planet? Airlines miss all but one climate target - report TheOffice for Environmental Protection,external(OEP) was set up under the 2021 Environment Act to hold the government and other public bodies to account in England and Northern Ireland. Its first report, described as a ""polite demolition"" of the government's track record, paints a picture of environmental crises on land, in the air and in the seas and rivers. A swan making a home among the debris Among the issues identified by the OEP are thestate of England's inland rivers and waterways. They face pollution from multiple sources including agricultural runoff and discharges from sewage treatment works. While the government is praised for putting in place a25-year environment plan in 2018, the OEP says that progress on delivery has been far too slow, and, so far, it has failed to halt the loss of species or the unsustainable use of resources. ""The 25-year environment plan was an ambitious attempt to confront the challenges facing the environment, yet we continue to see worrying and persistent trends of environmental decline,"" said Dame Glenys Stacey, chair of the OEP. ""Our rivers are in a poor state, bird and other species numbers are in serious decline, poor air quality threatens the health of many, and our seas and sea floor are not managed sustainably."" Of even greater concern are the potential for ""tipping points"", where long term, slow declines become irreversible. The OEP identifies a number of these points, including the decline in fish stocks and the widespread use of nutrients on farmland. To tackle the problems, the report says the government needs to urgently ""take stock"" and set out an ""ambitious vision"". The OEP highlights six ""building blocks"" that it believes are needed to help turn around environmental decline. These include a better understanding of environmental pressures and drivers, setting more effective targets, and having a coherent strategy and policy. Protestors demand that sewage runoffs into the rivers and seas should end ""Our argument is that with the resources that are already available to government, for protecting, restoring and enhancing the environment, a much better job could be done, if the building blocks that we highlight are considered,"" said Dame Stacey. ""If there is a persistent effort, and a real attention to prioritisation in relation to environmental matters, we'll get a long way,"" she said. In response to the new study, Environment Minister Rebecca Pow said: ""We welcome this report, which acknowledges that our Environment Act gives us new tools to make a real difference to our environment, putting it at the heart of government and transitioning us to a sustainable future with nature on the road to recovery during this decade. ""Six months on from the Act gaining Royal Assent, we are currently consulting on legally binding environmental targets which include a world-leading target to halt species decline by 2030. We have launched a consultation to deliver the largest programme in history to tackle storm sewage discharges and we have taken action to transform the way that we deal with waste."" The government says it will formally respond to the OEP's recommendations this summer. Follow Matt on Twitter@mattmcgrathbbc,external.

Disney sees better than expected streaming growth,"Encanto is about a family called the Madrigals who live hidden in the mountains of Colombia Walt Disney has reported another jump in sign-ups for its streaming services, escaping the slowdown that hit arch rival Netflix. More than 9 million people subscribed to the firm's online video platforms in the first three months of the year, most of them to its flagship Disney+. The parks business also boomed, extending a rebound from the pandemic. Disney's performance was under scrutiny after Netflix reported a fall in subscribers last month. Netflix, an early pioneer in streaming, has been having a harder time signing up new members, as it tries to build from an already massive 220 million base and more competitors enter the industry. But analysts had worried that its troubles might be more widespread and signal a wider slowdown in consumer demand for streaming. ""A huge sigh of relief for Disney"", said Paolo Pescatore, PP Foresight analyst. Disney has poured investment into its streaming services, seeing them as key to the future of its business, as movie attendance wanes and more people turn from traditional television. Since launching in 2019, the number of Disney+ subscribers has reached nearly 138 million, drawn by hits such as Marvel's ""Moon Knight"" series and Pixar movie ""Turning Red"". The firm also owns Hulu, ESPN and Hotstar in India. Disney executives said subscriber growth over the last six months was stronger than they had expected. They said that may slow in coming months, as the firm enters markets, like Poland, where the war in Ukraine is affecting sentiment. But they said they remained confident that they will hit sign-up goals. ""We still do expect an increase in growth,"" said chief financial officer Christine McCarthy. Mr Pescatore said the company's growth was likely to remain strong, as the company launches in more markets overseas. The company is also planning an ad-supported service. ""For now, take-up for its direct-to-consumer services like Disney+ remains robust and will continue to do so,"" he said. ""Ultimately, it is in a different phase of growth compared to rivals including Netflix, akin to a start-up."" Overall Disney revenues in the first three months of the year rose 23% from a year ago to $19.25bn, boosted by its amusement park business, which saw revenues more than double. Profits fell to $470m, down from roughly $900m last year. The streaming business is still losing money; the company was also hit by a $1bn charge it paid to end distribution deals for movies and television so they could put the content on their own services.

Patients 'at risk' without Stormont executive,"Politicians are being urged to put patients first in Northern Ireland Healthcare leaders in Northern Ireland have urged elected representatives to ""put patients first"" and immediately form a new executive at Stormont. The British Medical Association Northern Ireland (BMA) and four royal colleges said failure to go into government ""will put patients at risk"". One said that ""it is fair to say lives are being lost"" and that things are getting ""worse and worse"". The Department of Health said sustained year-on-year funding was needed. Last week's election saw Sinn FÃ©in win the most seats for the first time. However, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) has said it will not go into an executive until there are significant changes to the Northern Ireland Protocol. The protocol is an issue under fresh scrutiny following the elections to the Northern Ireland Assembly. The elections cemented a majority for assembly members who accept the protocol, including the new largest party, the republican party Sinn FÃ©in. The DUP said it would not nominate any ministers to a Northern Ireland Executive until its concerns about the protocol were resolved. It has alsorefused to say if it will support the election of a new Speakerwhen the Northern Ireland Assembly meets on Friday. The executive can not properly function without a first and deputy first minister. Caretaker ministers, who were in post before the collapse of Stormont in February, can continue to run their respective departments without an executive, but no new decisions, such as agreeing a budget, can be taken. Why is the DUP against the NI Protocol? But speaking on behalf of nurses, surgeons, GPs, and emergency doctors, the healthcare leaders urged politicians to agree a multi-year budget to allow for effective planning and delivery of services. Healthcare leaders have issued a joint statement urging the formation of a government executive at Stormont They said the situation in the health service could not be more serious. ""The lack of political stability puts basic service delivery at risk and inhibits our ability to make progress on key transformation projects including addressing our waiting lists, tackle the crisis in emergency admissions and improving capacity in general practice,"" the healthcare leaders said in a joint statement on Thursday. ""It also means we cannot fund our elective care, mental health and cancer strategies.  We cannot underestimate the huge uncertainty this has on patients. ""The price of political failure is too severe and will be felt in the worsening health of our most vulnerable citizens,"" they said. Paul Kerr, vice president of the Royal College of Energency Medicine, said: ""We are seeing things get worse and worse and I think it's fair to say lives are being lost. ""It is very serious, but the problem is that it's been getting worse for some time and there is no exaggeration, it is about lives and it is about those vulnerable people, most sick people, in our system not getting the treatment they need on time. Paul Kerr said emergency care problems seem to be worse in Northern Ireland than anywhere else in the UK ""Lives are lost when people don't get timely treatment for conditions that are time critical and that's what we do at the emergency department - we treat people for heart attacks and strokes and trauma. ""If they're left sitting on the road, or left sitting in a trolley in the emergency department, obviously there is increased risk. ""I have seen that and I hear reports of that all across Northern Ireland and the figures suggest that it is worse in Northern Ireland than anywhere else in the UK."" Mr Kerr said the the problems had to be tackled as urgently as possible. ""There is great frustration and I have to say morale has dropped, we are losing staff, it's affecting staff and patients."" The Department of Health said ""building blocks"" were in place for the reconstruction of the health service. ""These include the detailed strategies for cancer care, mental health and dealing with elective care waiting lists,"" the department said. ""The public consultations on social care and urgent and emergency care will similarly chart a new direction for those vital areas. Investment also continues in growing the workforce. ""Rebuilding will require sustained year-on-year funding and changes to the way we organise key services."" In a separate development, approximately 100 new places in nursing and Allied Health Professionals will be available as part of a Â£2.1m education and training investment package. Health Minister Robin Swann said sustained investment in education and training was ""essential to the rebuilding"" of the system. A further 44 nurses will be recruited under the International Nurses Recruitment Programme with an additional 10 nursing and midwifery university places above the normal ratio. The package includes a former commitment to delivering 1,335 nursing and midwifery university places for 2022-23. Despite the political uncertainty, Mr Swann is able make this announcement as it is deemed normal departmental business. The Department of Health has committed to creating 900 nursing training places by 2023 In January 2020, underThe New Decade, New Approach,externalgovernment agreement, the Department of Health committed to creating 900 nursing training places by 2023. Mr Swann said that despite ongoing ""budgetary pressures and uncertainty""  his department could maintain that commitment. NI health service 'still reeling from pandemic' Nurses 'showing signs of inability to keep going' The 41 allied health professional posts include 10 places in each of physiotherapy and occupation therapy, three in podiatry, five speech and language therapy and three in dietetics. Training will also be enhanced within oncology (including paediatric cardiology) radiology, vascular surgery and transplant surgery. This week, the Department of Health also announced an extension around the consultations on minimum unit pricing for alcohol and on Reform of Adult Social care. A public consultation of the future of urgent and emergency care was launched in March.

Relentless and unbearable â the condition affecting one in four,"Jen Proudler lives in constant pain and is desperate for a better way to manage her condition. Relentless. Unbearable. Overwhelming. These are just some of the words used by the thousands of people who have revealed their battle with long-term, persistent pain. Anexclusive survey of over 4,000 adults aged 16-75 for BBC News, carried out by research company Ipsos, suggests that a quarter of people in the UK are living with chronic pain - an often hidden and misunderstood condition. And pain specialists warn the health service is not set up to deal with such complex conditions. They say the treatments on offer are decades behind the science, leaving millions of patients without the support they need to manage their pain. Chronic pain - defined as pain that lasts longer than three months - can drastically change people's lives. It can be caused by a physical problem - such as a slipped disc, but can also occur with no clear cause - known as primary pain. It destroys careers, breaks up relationships, steals independence and denies people the futures they had imagined. Jen Proudler says chronic pain has left her grieving for ""the person she was"". It started four years ago with sporadic back pain, which she managed with the help of hot baths and paracetamol. Now she relies on opioid patches, anti-inflammatories, nerve pain medications and beta-blockers just to get through the day. ""It has flipped everything upside down,"" she says. ""I feel I've lost every part of my life. I've lost me."" Jen, 38, who lives with her partner in Farsley near Leeds, was working as a dental hygienist and had a busy social life when she first started experiencing pain in February 2018. Jen Proudler used to work as a dental hygienist - a job she loved Her doctor said it was a problem with a disc in her back and advised taking some time off. Jen rested for about eight weeks, then went back to work. The pain hadn't gone away but she felt she needed to get back to ""some kind of normality"". ""There were days when it was really bad, but I have this attitude of battling through it, because that's what you do,"" she says. But nine months after the pain first began, Jen was driving to work when she felt the most excruciating pain. ""It was how I would imagine being kicked in the back by a horse."" Later that day she lost all sensation in her right leg. That was the last time she made it to work. After several incorrect diagnoses, Jen was eventually told by a neurosurgeon that she had a ""pretty massive"" far lateral disc herniation in her spine - a slipped disc that then compresses the nerves around it. But by then something was going on - her body's defence system had gone into overdrive in response to the agony she was experiencing. The pain has now spread around her body - Jen has burning pins and needles sensations down her leg, as well as sharp pain, as if being cut by a razor. Sometimes it's so bad, she can't even bear any fabric to touch it. ""Our nervous system becomes more and more protective, it feels danger and sends warning signals - and those warning signals contribute to the pain,"" explains Dr Chris Barker, clinical director of an NHS community pain service in Ainsdale, Merseyside. He says such pain can be hard to diagnose, and the difficulty of getting the correct treatment can make things worse. ""Incorrect diagnoses, delayed diagnoses, poor experiences in and out of the health system, not being believed - all of these can contribute to a more intense experience of pain."" Dr Barker says the NHS is not set up to deal with such a complex condition, despite the fact it is so common. ""The prevalence of pain is huge. It dwarfs most other conditions."" Dr Chris Barker leads a team of psychologists, pharmacists and physiotherapists The BBC study is the most recent snapshot - previous studies have found chronic pain affects between 20-50% of the UK - and the prevalence may be even higher in older age groups. Persistent pain that lasts more than three months, despite medication or other forms of treatment Secondary chronic pain is a pain which tends to be caused by another condition, for example, arthritis, endometriosis, cancer pain Primary chronic pain is a condition in its own right - there is no known condition other than the pain itself - this can include conditions such as fibromyalgia or complex regional pain syndrome Chronic pain is often confused with acute pain - a short-term pain such as a broken bone or a torn muscle Latest guidelines from the health regulator National Institute of Health and Care Excellence,external(NICE) say chronic primary pain should not be treated with opioids, or even paracetamol, while inScotland, opioids can be prescribed for chronic pain,externalin certain cases. Yet the results from BBC's Ipsos survey suggest nearly a quarter of those who live with chronic pain are currently taking opioids - ranging from medication such as codeine to more powerful painkillers like morphine and fentanyl. Opioids are useful for short-term, acute pain, but there is little evidence they help long-term, persistent pain. Despite this, opioid prescribing more than doubled between 1998 to 2018. It prompted the MHRA, the UK's medicine regulator, to issue stronger warnings around the risk of addiction and overdose. Our research suggests that more than 40% of those currently using opioids began taking them over five years ago, before these warnings were issued. Sitting at her kitchen table, packets of pills stacked up nearby, Jen says every day now revolves around managing her pain. Despite the support of her GP, she is struggling to see a way forward. She says the medication helps her function, but she worries she's running out of options in the long term. Pain specialists believe the science calls for a different approach involving more support, more tailored care and most importantly, more options of how to cope with such a life-changing condition. Chronic pain: Antidepressants not painkillers recommended Dr Cathy Stannard, clinical lead on persistent pain for NICE, says medication like opioids has very little benefit for people with certain types of chronic pain. She fears millions of patients are not getting the bespoke treatment needed for such a complex condition. But the other options are a difficult sell to a patient in distress - especially in an under-pressure health service where they often don't get the chance to build up a trusting, empathetic relationship. ""People who are living with pain very understandably present with high levels of distress. When they say, 'Are you going to leave me in pain?' it is very difficult to say 'Yes.' It is always with the best intentions that we prescribe medicines, but often, it is a response to distress rather than a rational clinical decision."" Patients tend to need the support of their GP, physiotherapists, psychologists and pharmacists. Depending on the condition, medication can be helpful but may only be part of the treatment - other elements that help include: Exercise Physical therapies (hot or cold packs, massage, hydrotherapy) Physiotherapy Acupuncture Psychological therapies (trauma therapy, cognitive behaviour therapy, meditation) Community support groups Dr Stannard stresses the NICE guidelines were not written to take medication away from people who feel it is helping them. The problem, she says, is the lack of options or tailored treatment for such a complex condition - and too often medication becomes the only answer, instead of part of it. And no-one should stop or change their medication without speaking to their doctor. Benjamin Ellis, a consultant rheumatologist and senior policy advisor for the charity Versus Arthritis, agrees, and says that while opioids can help people manage some conditions like osteoarthritis, too often they are seen as a long-term answer. ""The health system is set up to support the prescribing of medication rather than supporting patients to access other treatments - physical activity, programmes to help people with their mental health, community support, peer support - they're not so readily available, and even where they are, they're not well connected with health services."" Lorraine English's story illustrates the potential dangers of being prescribed opioids long term. She was a busy single mum with four kids, working as a teaching assistant, when she started to notice pain that had started in her neck and spread into her head and back. It led to her taking high doses of opioids, including morphine, for 12 years - at times she says she felt like her life was over. ""It was so frightening, so isolating"". With the help of her GP, Lorraine has weaned herself off opioids Lorraine, from Burnage, south Manchester, was eventually diagnosed with degenerative disc disease, osteoarthritis and fibromyalgia - a condition which causes all-over body pain and extreme tiredness. ""I would get nerve pain shooting through my head and it would cause migraines, light-sensitivity - just my heel touching the floor would send pain up into my head."" As the pain continued, her opioid dose increased, while her ability to cope decreased. Eventually she had to give up work, taking pill after pill to beat what is known as ""breakthrough pain"" - a flare-up of pain despite being on huge doses of painkillers. For the last three years of her life on morphine, Lorraine was unable to function - bed-bound, existing in a fog of medication, her life ruled by pain. ""It's like being in a medicated coma and you can't reach out to anybody, because you're not even aware anyone's out there. I felt like that for years, just laid in bed with my kids checking on me, asking, 'You okay?'"" Lorraine kept a pain diary in 2017 which she hoped would help but just reminds her of how difficult her life was. Lorraine says she realised that she needed to reduce her medication - not only was she struggling to function, but she felt it was making the pain worse. It took nearly a year, but with the help of her GP, Lorraine has gradually tapered off her opioid medication, and the pain has reduced. Now opioid-free, she says she has learned to ""embrace"" the pain she still feels, and understand her body's limits. ""No matter how much pain I am in, I want to be able to manage it so I can hug my grandkids,"" she says. People who live with chronic pain have told us how difficult it is to access any specialist services. Our research suggests that nearly a quarter (23%) of those living with chronic pain are on waiting lists for surgery or a pain management programme. An NHS spokesperson said more clinical pharmacists and trained staff are being recruited and will be based at GP surgeries so patients can get access to specialist care and be ""offered alternatives to medication where appropriate"". There are areas of the UK which are offering a whole patient approach, like at Dr Barker's clinic in Ainsdale, Merseyside, where he leads a team of pharmacists, physiotherapists and psychologists. This video can not be played At the age of 13 Luke woke up in horrific pain and a decade on his condition is still undiagnosed. Over the last 20 years, he says, the scientific understanding of pain - how our brains respond, how we process it - has been transformed. Hurt does not always equal harm, he explains, and someone can be in pain without any physical injury. ""Our traditional model of thinking about pain is about MRI scans and looking for structural things - the problem is we interpret that to mean that's going to be the cause of pain."" ""While youâre laughing youâre not crying"" says Kev, who runs a chronic pain peer support group in Merseyside Chronic pain is far more complex than that - an overly sensitised nervous system can change a normal signal from one of the body's sensors into a threat signal which our brain then interprets as pain. There may be many complex reasons why the nervous system has been put on ""red alert"", he says. If people are dealing with trauma, stress or grief, that can contribute to chronic pain. A Life Of Pain The BBC News investigation unearths huge numbers of people living with chronic pain. In an exclusive documentary, Dominic Hughes hears stories from those in pain, across the UK. Watch on BBC iPlayer now. This is why, Dr Barker says, sharing experiences can play a vital role when living with pain. Many of his patients attend Pain Clinic Plus, a peer support group at his clinic. ""People tend to become isolated because they can't do what they used to do, so people stop phoning them,"" says Kev Howard, one of the organisers, who has lived with pain for years following a shoulder injury. ""It's so easy to sit at home and take a pill and fall asleep. The other way to go is to pop into groups similar to this, and basically have a laugh - because while you're laughing you're not crying.""

Finland and Sweden: Neutral to Nato?,"Both Sweden and Finland have increased their military budget in recent years Sweden is now set to join neighbouring Finland as a new Nato member, after Turkey's president withdrew a series of objections. Finland officially joined the Western defensive alliance in April, bringing the number of member states to 31. The two Nordic states have long maintained military neutrality, but that changed in February 2022 when Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine - the biggest war on the European continent since World War Two. It was Magdalena Andersson of Sweden and Finland's Sanna Marin who kick-started the countries' bids to join Nato in 2022 Vladimir Putin's full-scale invasion shattered a long-standing sense of stability in northern Europe, leaving Sweden and Finland feeling vulnerable. Finnish ex-Prime Minister Alexander Stubb said joining the alliance was a ""done deal"" for his country as soon as Russian troops invaded Ukraine last year. For many Finns, the war brought a haunting sense of familiarity. It was in late 1939 that the Soviets invaded Finland. For more than three months the Finnish army put up fierce resistance, despite being heavily outnumbered. Finland held out until March 1940 but lost its eastern province of Karelia to Russia. They avoided occupation, but ended up losing 10% of their territory. Watching the war in Ukraine unfold was like reliving this history, said Iro Sarkka, a political scientist at the University of Helsinki. Finns were looking at their 1,340km (830 mile) border with Russia, she said, and thinking: ""Could this happen to us?"" Finland held out until March 1940 but lost its eastern province of Karelia to Russia Sweden has also felt endangered in recent years. Sweden's military weakness came into full view in 2013 when Russian bomber planes were able to simulate an attack on Stockholm and Sweden needed Nato help to ward them off. In 2014, Swedes were transfixed by reports that a Russian submarine was lurking in the shallow waters of the Stockholm archipelago. In 2018, every household received army pamphlets titled ""if crisis or war comes"" - the first time they were sent out since 1991. For a population of only 5.5 million, Finland's conscript military is highly trained and potentially large. It trains at least 21,000 conscripts every year and has a reserve force of 900,000, soits wartime strength is estimated at 280,000,external. Sweden's military capacity is far smaller at 57,000. But it brought back conscription at the start of 2018, after suspending it in 2010, and the current number of up to 6,000 conscripts will rise to 8,000 in 2025. From the 1990s Sweden cut back the size of its military and changed its priorities from territorial defence to peacekeeping missions around the world. But that went into reverse with Russia's invasion of Crimea in 2014 and its increasing threat in the Baltic region. In some ways, not much. Sweden and Finland became official partners of Nato in 1994 and have since become major contributors to the alliance. They have taken part in several Nato missions since the end of the Cold War. The two countries will for the first time have security guarantees from nuclear states under Nato's Article 5, which views an attack on one member state as an attack on all. Historian Henrik Meinander said Finns were mentally prepared for membership, following a succession of small steps towards Nato since the fall of the Soviet Union. In 1992, Helsinki bought 64 US combat planes. Three years later, it joined the European Union, alongside Sweden, and every Finnish government since then has reviewed the so-called Nato option. Finland has already reached Nato's agreed defence spending target of 2% of GDP, and Sweden has drawn up plans to do so by 2026. Sweden may have been neutral during the Cold War but at the time it kept a force of at least 15,000 soldiers on the Baltic island of Gotland and has recently rebuilt its presence there. It hopes to build up its full-time military as well as its conscript force in the coming years. Is Nato's Nordic expansion a threat or boost to Europe? Russian President Vladimir Putin believes Nato expansion is a direct threat to his country's security - and claimed it was the reason he launched the 2022 war in Ukraine. But his invasion had the opposite effect by only serving to extend Nato's reach. Finland's accession was a particular setback, further extending Nato's influence over the Baltic Sea. And it brought a warning from the Kremlin of unspecified ""military-technical"" measures in retaliation. Russia's foreign ministry said both Sweden and Finland had been warned of the consequences if they did choose to join. Now that Sweden has been given the green light by Turkey to become a member, the Kremlin has said it will respond with the same kind of measures it proposed for Finland. What those measures would be is still vague. Russia says it has moved tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus, and they could reach Finland and Sweden. But former Finnish PM Alexander Stubb has warned that Russian cyber attacks, disinformation campaigns and occasional airspace violations are more likely. Under Article Five, Finland has - and Sweden will - soon have the commitment of the entire alliance to come to their aid if they come under attack. Their membership also makes defending the Nordic and Baltic region far more comprehensive. But there is a significant minority, at least in Sweden, who believe membership will have an adverse effect. Deborah Solomon, from the Swedish Peace and Arbitration Society, argued that Nato's nuclear deterrence increased tensions and risked an arms race with Russia. This complicated peace efforts, she said, and made Sweden a less safe place. Another fear is that in joining the alliance, Sweden would lose its leading role in global nuclear disarmament efforts. Many of Sweden's Nato-sceptics look back to the period between the 1960s and '80s, when Sweden used its neutrality to position itself as an international mediator. Joining Nato would be abandoning that dream, Ms Solomon said. Finland's neutrality was very different. It came about as a condition of peace imposed by the Soviet Union in a 1948 ""friendship agreement"". It was seen as a pragmatic way of surviving and maintaining the country's independence. If Sweden's neutrality was a matter of identity and ideology, in Finland it was a question of existence, said Henrik Meinander. Part of the reason Sweden could even afford to have a debate about Nato membership was because it used Finland and the Baltics as a ""buffer zone"", he said. Finland abandoned its neutrality after the Soviet Union collapsed. It looked to the West and sought to free itself from the Soviet sphere of influence. Turkey, and to a lesser extent Hungary, initially resisted both applications. Ankara accused the Nordic nations of supporting what it called terrorist organisations, including the Kurdish militant PKK and the Gulen movement, which Turkey blames for an attempted coup in 2016. Kurds make up 15-20% of Turkey's population, and have been persecuted by Turkish authorities for generations. But it was Sweden that triggered most hostility as Kurds have mobilised successfully in politics there over the decades. President Erdogan asked how ""how a country with terrorists on the streets... can contribute to Nato"". His main demand was to end political, financial and ""arms support"" to militants. Sweden updated its terror laws in June 2023 to outlaw taking part in an extremist group in a way that supported it - and weeks later a Kurdish man was jailed for attempting to finance terrorism. But there was some suggestion, denied by Turkey, that its main reason for resisting Sweden's bid was that Ankara was waiting for the US to provide F-16 fighter jets.

UK agrees security deals with Finland and Sweden,"This video can not be played WATCH: UK and Sweden will 'face new reality together' The UK has agreed mutual security pacts with Sweden and Finland, agreeing to come to their aid should either nation come under attack. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson visited both countries to sign the deals, amid debate about them joining Nato. The pacts also state that Finland and Sweden would assist the UK in a crisis. Mr Johnson and Swedish PM Magdalena Andersson said co-operation was ""even more important"" given Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The second deal was announced in a joint press conference with Finnish President Sauli NiinistÃ¶. Mr Johnson said the ""solemn declaration"" between the UK and Finland was reflective of the ""extreme difficulty of the times we are in"". He emphasised the deal was ""not a short-term stop gap"" while Finland considered whether to join the Nato defensive alliance, but rather a ""enduring assurance between two nations"". Sauli Niinisto said Finland appreciated the UK's ""strong support"" Asked if there would be ""British boots on the ground"" in Finland should a conflict break out, Mr Johnson said military assistance would be offered, but that the ""nature of that assistance"" would depend upon the ""request of the other party"". Mr Johnson added the agreement would become the ""foundation of an intensification of our security and our defence relationship in other ways as well"". Mr NiinistÃ¶ said his nation appreciated the UK's ""strong support"" of Nato's open-door policy to Finland's potential membership. He said joining Nato would not be ""against anybody"" and the UK deal was intended to ""maximise our security one way or another"" while considering joining the defensive alliance. However, when asked if the possible move could provoke President Vladimir Putin, Mr NiinistÃ¶ said Russia would be responsible if Sweden or Finland joined Nato. He said Russia was suggesting the two nations did not have their ""own will"" by threatening them against applying for membership. ""They are ready to attack their neighbouring country, so... my response would be that 'you caused this - look at the mirror'"". Are Sweden and Finland going from neutral to Nato? What is Nato and could Finland and Sweden join? Is Nato's Nordic expansion a threat or boost to Europe? Speaking earlier in Sweden Mr Johnson said: ""If Sweden were attacked and looked to us for help and support, then we would provide it."" Asked by the BBC to spell out exactly what the UK would do if Russia attacked Sweden, Mr Johnson said the deal meant that ""upon request from the other party, we would come to the other party's assistance"". Ms Andersson argued her country would be safer as a result of the mutual assistance agreement with the UK, adding: ""Of course this means something. This is important whatever policy choice we make in Sweden."" She also explained the country was ""exploring all possible options and Nato is one of them that is on the table"". Finland says applying to join Nato is all about defence. But Vladimir Putin doesn't see it that way. He's always viewed Nato's eastern expansion as a threat. Finland shares an 800 mile (1300km) long border with Russia, bringing the alliance's military might that much closer Moscow. Finnish and Swedish membership will make Nato more robust too - boosting its eastern flank and presence in the Baltic Sea. And the Kremlin has threatened retaliation. Some fear it might deploy targeted nuclear weapons. But Finnish diplomats I've spoken to believe Russia has its military hands full in Ukraine and that it will instead focus on cyber and disinformation campaigns. They say President Putin has himself to blame for Nato expanding. Before Russia invaded Ukraine, most Finns and Swedes preferred to work alongside, but not inside, Nato. Russia's aggression - its expansionist zeal - changed all that. The agreements with Sweden and Finland are not a legal or automatic security guarantee but a political declaration that the UK would come to their aid, if requested. In an interview with the BBC, Mr Johnson described the deal with Sweden as stating something that ""should be implicit"" in the countries' relationship anyway. Asked if he thought Sweden should join Nato, Mr Johnson said it was ""not for the UK to intervene"" in their internal debate over whether to apply to become a member of the alliance. But he added: ""We would strongly support Sweden's accession, if that's what the Swedes chose to do. We'd certainly try to make things go smoothly and easily as possible."" This video can not be played Watch: Boris Johnson says the UK and Sweden have made a ""solemn declaration"" to protect each other Nato - the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation - is a 30-nation defensive alliance founded shortly after the end of World War Two. It has its headquarters in Brussels, but is dominated by the massive military and nuclear missile power of the US. Support for joining the Nato has increased in both Sweden and Finland since Russia invaded Ukraine, despite their long history of pursuing policies of military neutrality to avoid conflict with regional powers. Finland and Sweden are both modern, democratic countries that fulfil the criteria for membership. Nato's chief, secretary general Jens Stoltenberg, has said the alliance would welcome them with open arms and there would be minimum delay in processing their membership. Russia has previously warned both nations not to join Nato and threatened ""a military technical response"" if they do try to become members. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov stressed that Moscow would have to ""rebalance the situation"" with its own measures if any bid went ahead.

We're closing our live coverage of the war in Ukraine for today in a little while. We'll leave you with a brief recap of what's happened: Fighting in the east  Beyond the Donbas region  In diplomacy  You can read about more of the day's key events here. Ukraine has said it is returning the bodies of fallen Russian troops back home. On Friday, military officials were seen loading and stacking bodies collected from the Kyiv and Chernihiv regions onto refrigerated rail cars. The move is in accordance with ""the norms of international humanitarian law"", according to Volodymyr Lyamzin, the head of Ukraine's civil-military cooperation. ""After the active phase of the conflict is over, sides have to return the bodies of the military of another country. Ukraine is ready to return the bodies to the aggressor,â Lyamzin told the Reuters news agency. Several refrigerated trains have reportedly been stationed in other parts of the country as well. Ukraine claims it has killed some 20,000 Russian troops. Russia has not updated its death toll since 25 March, when it acknowledged 1,351 deaths. TheBBC Ukrainian serviceis reporting that the Ukrainian army has released two decks of cards depicting Russians they suspect of war crimes. The idea replicates the set of55 playing cardsthat the US military produced in the 2003 invasion of Iraq, depicting what it said were the most wanted members of Saddam Hussein's government. Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Valerii Zaluzhnyi, said the cards were produced with the help of volunteers from the international intelligence community InformNapalm. US President Joe Biden has spoken with the leaders of Finland and Sweden about their plans to join the Nato alliance. The White House said Biden had held a joint phone call with Finnish President Sauli NiinistÃ¶ and Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson about the issue on Friday. A readout of the call claims the trio discussed Natoâs Open Door policy and ""the right of Finland and Sweden to decide their own future, foreign policy, and security arrangements"". Afterwards, NiinistÃ¶ wrote on Twitter that he ""went through Finland's next steps towards Nato membership"" on the call. It comes a day after NiinistÃ¶ and Finland's PM Sanna Marin called for the historically neutral country to apply for Nato membership ""without delay"". Sweden will announce its own decision on joining Nato on Sunday. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

As we reported on Thursday, a US lawmaker has single-handedly blocked a multi billion-dollar aid package to Ukraine from passing this week. President Joe Biden had called on Congress to send the bill - $39.8bn in economic, humanitarian and security assistance - to his desk by the end of the week, but Senator Rand Paul blocked an expedited vote on Thursday evening alleging that the government was ""shuffling money out the door as fast as they can"" with no oversight. ""My oath of office is to the US Constitution, not to any foreign nation,"" Paul said on the Senate floor defending his decision. ""We cannot save Ukraine by dooming the US economy."" The senator from Kentucky is calling for a watchdog provision in the bill to oversee how the money is being spent, an amendment that would require further delays in the bill's passage. Congressional leaders have chided the congressman for causing the delay, as the current bill has enough votes to pass in the Senate through regular order but this will now not happen until next week. Paul's defiance has been lauded in some corners, with former president Donald Trump's son arguing lawmakers in Washington - or ""the swamp"" as he called them - ""don't want transparency"".

Sweden and Finland have said that they will hold talks with the Turkish government after its president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, said he was not in favour of their plans to join Nato. The Swedish and Finnish foreign ministers, Ann Linde and Pekka Haavisto said they would speak to their Turkish counterpart, Mevlut Cavusoglu, about the issue at a Nato meeting on Saturday. Erdogan said that Nordic countries had given asylum to people Turkey considers to be Kurdish terrorists. He added that he did not want Nato to repeat what he called the mistake of the past when it allowed Greece to join. Responding to Turkey's comments, the US said Turkey ""is a valued Nato ally"" and ""they've been involved and helpful in trying to get a dialogue going here, between Russia and Ukraine"". John Kirby, press secretary for the US Ministry of Defence, added ""we're working to better clarify the [Turkey's] position here"". Law enforcement officers in Ukraine are investigating 41 Russian servicemen suspected of having committed war crimes in the country, Interfax-Ukraine news agency reports. Prosecutor-General Iryna Venediktova said the suspects will be investigated for a range of crimes - from the bombing of civilian infrastructure, killing of civilians, rape and looting. The suspects will answer before a Ukrainian court of law, she added. Today, a Russian soldier accused of killing an unarmed 62-year-old civilian appeared in court in Kyiv. Vadim Shishimarin, 21, was brought to court for a preliminary hearing. He faces possible life imprisonment on charges of war crimes and premeditated murder. During a televised address on Friday evening, Venediktova said preliminary hearings on two more suspects will be carried out next week. The leader of breakaway region South Ossetia has announced a referendum on whether to become a part of Russia. A statement from the office of Anatoly Bibilov said it was his people's ""historic aspiration"" to come together with Russia, and the vote would take place on 17 July. Moscow recognises the region as independent, after a brief war between Russia and Georgia in 2008, and has provided financial support, Russian citizenship for its citizens and sited military bases there. Georgia maintains that South Ossetia is an occupied territory and previously said that a referendum on joining Russia would be unacceptable. Negotiations with Russia over freeing the Ukrainian fighters under siege in the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol were ""very difficult"", Ukraine's deputy prime minister has said. In an online post, Iryna
Vereshchuk wrote: ""The result may not be to everyone's liking, but our task is
to evacuate our boys. All of them. ""Alive."" Yesterday, the Ukrainian government said that it was pushing for safe passage for 38 badly wounded fighters, in exchange for captured Russians. The Azovstal complex once sheltered hundreds of civilians and fighters, but after several weeks trapped underground civilians were freed in a series of humanitarian convoys last week and negotiations over the fighters began. The Russian air force has attacked an arms depot in the Kharkiv region in Ukraine, state news agency RIA reports. The news agency quoted the Russian defence ministry saying it had hit the facility on Friday. Meanwhile, eyewitnesses to an earlier attack in Kharkiv told news agency AFP that they had been targeted by a Russian tank as they tried to seek shelter at home. ""Four people died, two were injured. My daughter died from a shrapnel wound in the back of her head,"" Olga Karpenko, 52, said. The BBC has not been able to independently verify this information. Sergei Shoigu (pictured) spoke with his US counterpart for an hour More details have emerged of the telephone call between US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin and Russia's Defence Minister Sergei Shoygu, in which General Austin called for an immediate ceasefire. Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said that Gen Austin had stressed the importance of maintaining communication, after Moscow had appeared uninterested in speaking to the US on previous attempts to hold the conversation. An anonymous US official said the tone of the hour-long call was ""professional"", but did not resolve any specific issues or lead to changes in Russian policy, news agency Reuters report. Russia's defence ministry confirmed that the US had initiated the call, and discussed ""topical issues of international security... including the situation in Ukraine"". Olga IvshinaSenior correspondent, BBC News Russian Since the start of the war, our team has been following and verifying reports of losses among Russian troops fighting in Ukraine by following official announcements, local media reports as well as social media and speaking to the relatives of Russian servicemen. Up to this moment BBC News Russian has been able to verify the deaths of 2,336 Russian servicemen. We have been able to establish their names, ranks and military units where they served. This is nearly twice the latest official figure released by the Russian Defence Ministry in March. It is likely that the real figure of the Russian military in Ukraine is far higher than we have been able to establish. But our data analysis helps to see the trends of what is happening with the Russian army fighting in Ukraine. Nearly 20% of all confirmed military casualties are officers. This proportion has remained unchanged for the past three months. Experts say that Russian officers may have to risk more on the frontline because of persistent problems with communications. Over 25% of all losses are paratroopers and marines. These units are often used in reconnaissance and storming operations. However they often donât get enough operational support and evacuation opportunities for the wounded. Most of the casualties, confirmed by us, came from the least developed and economically deprived regions of Russia. There are only three confirmed deaths of servicemen from Moscow, even though the capital makes up almost 9% of the Russian population. Ukrainian authorities now say that nearly 27,000 Russian soldiers have been killed. Read the full story on the BBC's Russian service here. As we've been reporting, Ukraine's Defence Minister Oleksiy Reznikov has said the country is entering a new stage of the war. Reznikov pledged to arm a million fighters using the new weapons and military equipment the US and other Western countries have been donating to the country over the last couple of weeks. The defence minister said that during the beginning of the war, ""volunteers were extremely helpful"" and it's thanks to their mobility that they ""quickly resolved highly pressing issues"". Reznikov said that to win, Ukraine ""must plan resources carefully and avoid mistakes"" and was investing in Ukrainian production facilities to ""ensure the stability and frequency of deliveries"". In his statement on Facebook, he said that Ukraine had relied on charitable aid from citizens, volunteers, and civic organisations for a significant proportion of its military equipment. He said that at the end of April, Ukraine's ministry of defence was relying on donations for 50% of the bullet proof vests used in combat. But as of 13 May, Ukraine has managed to increase its production to provide 57% of the armed forces' bullet proof vests, he added. More now on the suspension of electricity exports from Russia to Finland, which followed rising tensions over Helsinki's announcement of its plan to join Nato. RAO Nordic, a subsidiary of the Russian company Inter RAO, said non-payment was behind its decision to halt electrity supplies. The company said they had not received funds since 6 May and described the situation as ""exceptional"", adding that it is the first time it's happened ""in over 20 years of our trading history"". It did not specify whether this was due to the impact of sanctions but added, ""we hope that the situation will get improved soon and the electricity trade with Russia could resume"". Meanwhlle, the Finnish grid operator Fingrid said it did not anticpate any problems with supply as a result of the suspension. It said it would make up the shortfall by generating more power domestically and increasing imports from Sweden. This video can not be played Scenes of devastation as 'Russian battalion destroyed' If you're just joining us, here's a little recap of the latest events in Ukraine to bring you up to speed. Russian bridge-building foiled  Beyond the Donbas region  In diplomacy Ukraine's defence minister has said he hopes to arm a million fighters as the country prepares for a ""new, long phase of war"". Oleksiy Reznikov noted in a Facebook post that Ukraine would ""need to meticulously plan resources"" and ""avoid mistakes"" in order to win the war. Already, he said, Russia had suffered a ""strategic defeat"". The arrival of foreign weapons and ""stimulating Ukrainian producers"" would help further tip the balance against Russia, he continued. But before that, Ukraine was ""facing extremely difficult weeks ahead"". ""Nobody can tell how many. In that period, we will hold the defence primarily with our own resources against the enemy mad with rage,"" he predicted, in comments translated by our colleagues at BBC Monitoring. ""Increasing pressure of sanctions against Russia and increasing foreign assistance to Ukraine should create, within several months, the conditions under which the Kremlin will finally lose all chances to achieve any success. Then a new window of opportunity will appear for Ukraine. In this extremely hard period, we need unity, cohesion, will and patience,"" he concluded. Electricity exports from Russia to Finland are being suspended from 01:00 local time (22:00 GMT) on Saturday. Finnish grid operator Fingrid said Russian utility Inter RAO was stopping supplies due to ""problems in receiving payments for electricity sold on the market"". The announcement comes the day after Finland signalled its intention to join Nato. Finland only buys 10% of its electricity from Russia, and according to Fingrid it will make up the shortfall by sourcing more power from Sweden, and increasing generation in Finland. Finland expects to become self-sufficient in electrical energy in 2023, the company added.

from Moscow mean the Ukrainians are on the back foot around the Siversky Donets
river â even though theyâve managed to thwart Russian attempts to put down
bridges near Severodonetsk. âThe advantage is now on the side of the Russian Federation,â
Oleh Zhdanov tells the BBC. âWe still can't bring down Russia's offensive pace.â Zhdanov says itâs âvery importantâ that his
side keeps control of this part of the Siversky Donets. Gaining the area would allow the Russians to make a
bridgehead and advance in the direction of the riverâs estuary, Zhdanov explains.
This would let them encircle the key city of Severodonetsk more fully as they
attempt to cut off Ukraineâs whole eastern Donbas region. The order for soldiers to gain this territory came
from the very top, Zhdanov adds. âThey are advancing so hard because it is a
political task, because Putin has ordered it,â he says. As weâve been reporting today, UK
defence intelligence says a Russian battalion lost almost all its armoured
vehicles during failed attempts to establish bridges across the river. Russia
has not commented. Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoygu and his US counterpart Lloyd Austin have spoken for the first time since 18 February - before Russia invaded Ukraine. According to a statement issued by the Pentagon, Austin urged an immediate ceasefire in Ukraine and used the call to emphasise the importance of maintaining lines of communication. On Wednesday, Austin held talks with UK Defence Minister Ben Wallace. In a statement, Wallace said the two leaders pledged ""to continue to work with unity and resolve to provide
Ukraine with what it needs to defend itself against Russiaâs
unprovoked invasion"". Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
UK ticket holder claims Â£184m EuroMillions jackpot,"Tuesday's winning ticket will net the ticket holder Â£184,262,899.10. A UK ticket holder has claimed the Â£184m EuroMillions prize, the country's biggest National Lottery jackpot. Tuesday's winning numbers were 3, 25, 27, 28 and 29 - plus Lucky Star numbers 4 and 9. Camelot, the firm behind the National Lottery, said a single ticket-holder had come forward to claim the ""life-changing and record-breaking win"". It means 15 UK players have now won jackpots of more than Â£100m since EuroMillions launched in 2004. ""This is absolutely incredible news,"" said Camelot's Andy Carter, senior winners' adviser at the National Lottery, adding: ""We're ecstatic that we've now received a claim. ""Our focus now is on supporting the ticket holder through the process and helping them start to enjoy their truly life-changing and record-breaking win."" The claim will now go through a validation process to ensure terms and conditions are met and once the ticket has been validated the winner can choose whether or not to remain anonymous. This is the second EuroMillions jackpot won in the UK this year, with the Â£109 million jackpot from the draw on 4 February claimed a few days later, when the winner chose not to go public. Until Tuesday's result, the biggest lottery win in the UK was Â£170m in October 2019. The winner chose to remain anonymous. Colin and Chris Weir, who won Â£161m in 2011, are the biggest winners to have gone public. Mr Weirused his fortune to take over his favourite football club, Partick Thistle, with the intention of giving ownership to the fans.  Â£170mBritain's richest ever lottery winner stayed anonymous after their win in October 2019. Â£161mColin and Chris Weir (pictured) from North Ayrshire, Scotland in 2011. Â£148mAdrian and Gillian Bayford, from Suffolk, in 2012. Â£123mAnonymous UK ticket-holder in June 2019. Â£122mAnonymous UK ticket-holder in April 2021. The couple, from North Ayrshire,announced they were divorcingin 2019 after 38 years of marriage, and months laterMr Weir died, aged 71. The transferral of the ownership of Partick Thistle is currently in a state of flux, following a dispute between fans, the Thistle board and the company that currently holds Mr Weir's shares. Frances Connolly, who - along with husband Patrick - won Â£115m in 2019, making them the lottery's eighth biggest winners, revealed last month she had given away more than half of her fortune. The 55-year-old, from Hartlepool, said helping others ""gives you a buzz"", adding: ""I'm addicted to it now."" However, even Tuesday's winnings are small change compared with the Powerball and Mega Millions lottery games held in the US, which offer huge sums in a league of their own - albeit not tax-free, as is the case with winnings in Europe. Powerball holds the current world record for the largest lottery prize awarded. In January 2016, the advertised jackpot stood at $1.586bn (Â£1.2bn), surpassing the $1bn threshold for the first time - the winnings were ultimately shared among three ticket holders. The biggest individual win came two years later, with a single ticket holder from South Carolina pocketing a Mega Millions jackpot of $1.537bn - $878m (Â£709m) after tax.

Cash pulled from popular BTecs in move to T-levels,"BTecs in engineering and health and social care are to be scrapped for teenagers in England, as part of a move to T-level technical qualifications. The government has publisheda draft list,externalof 160 qualifications it says overlap with T-levels. Plans to withdraw funding for most BTecs and other applied general qualifications from 2024were criticised last year. Colleges said BTecs opened doors for poorer students. Other BTec Nationals on the list include: computer science business information systems children's play, learning and development It isestimated more than 230,000 students,externalcompleted BTec Nationals in 2021. T-levels, studied over one or two years and each worth three A-levels for university applications, were introduced in 2020. The 10 courses available so far include: education and childcare design, surveying and planning for construction BTecs can also be used for university applications, although many use them to gain occupation-specific skills. The engineering and health-and-social-care BTecs are popular at Leyton Sixth Form College, in London, principal Gill Burbridge says, and scrapping them would be ""a real cause for concern"". T-levels are important, she says, and she is introducing the college's first in September - but she is concerned about the pace of the rollout - because they require ""an awful lot of preparation"". ""We're not going to be in a position to rapidly expand our T-level provision, which means that other vocational qualifications - particularly the applied generals - are absolutely key in insuring that young people can access the right educational programme for them,"" Ms Burbridge says. And the changes could restrict students' choice, as it is possible to take only T-Level at a time. ""How confident are you at 16 to know with that degree of precision, 'I want to work within this sector?'"" Ms Burbridge asks. She is also worried about the ability to find work-experience placements for the pupils - and the financial impact on those who may have to find courses elsewhere. ""That may not be an option that they have because of the cost of travel,"" she says. Skills Minister Alex Burghart said this was the ""next step"" in the rollout of T-levels and about 175 colleges would offer them from September. ""Young people deserve a clear path and understanding of the qualifications and training routes that will lead to great careers,"" he said. And ""retiring"" some qualifications would ""help end the confusion and complexity we know puts some young people off studying technical options"". Awarding organisations with qualifications on the provisional list can appeal and a final list is due to be published in September. Government delays education changes by one year Scrapping BTecs 'hammer blow for social mobility' Reckless to scrap BTecs, educators warn Sixth Form Colleges Association chief executive Bill Watkin is pleased only a ""small proportion"" of more than 2,000 level-three applied general qualifications are on the list. But he said: ""Although only 160 qualifications appear on today's list, some - like the BTec diploma in health and social care - are enormously popular and are well respected by universities and employers and the impact of their removal will be felt by a significant number of young people."" BTecs ""have a vital role to play in the future qualifications landscape"", Mr Watkin added. Hehas previously calledthe shake-up ""a hammer-blow for social mobility"". Originally, funding for most BTecs was due to be phased out between 2023 and 2025. Buta campaign to stop them being scrapped so soonwon the backing of MPs and peers from across the parties in October. The move was then delayed by a year, with education leaders warning scrapping the qualifications was ""reckless"" and would harm the prospects of poorer pupils. Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi also announced the English and maths requirements for T-Levels would be removed so the government did not ""unnecessarily inhibit talented students"".

Sub-postmasters wrongly told to pay back money,"Louise Dar paid the Post Office Â£44,000 which was wrongly deemed to have gone missing from her business Former sub-postmasters have told an inquiry they had to pay tens of thousands to the Post Office after being wrongly accused of fraud. More than 700 sub-postmasters and mistresses in the UK were accused of theft and false accounting because of flaws in the organisation's IT system. Some ended up in prison while others lost their jobs. The scandal has been described as ""the most widespread miscarriage of justice in UK history"". A public inquiry into the cases, which date back to between 2000 and 2014, opened in London earlier this year. It is now hearing two days of evidence in Glasgow. The Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission - which looks into miscarriages of justice - has written to 73 potential victims in Scotland and is currently investigating eight cases. Post Office scandal ruined lives, inquiry hears Post Office scandal: 'My mother was honest' Why were hundreds of sub-postmasters prosecuted? 'I want someone else jailed like I was' Louise Dar told the inquiry she was forced to pay Â£44,000 which was wrongly deemed to have gone missing from her sub-post office in Lenzie, East Dunbartonshire. Mrs Dar, 39, said she and her family regularly worked late into the night trying to clear up shortfalls which didn't actually exist. She said: ""It was out of control. Every day I was paying in Â£20, Â£40 or Â£100 to make up the shortfall. ""It was just money going into a black hole. ""Customers would come in the next day and say, is that you having problems again with the Post Office because I saw the light on last night. ""We thought, we'll sort it, we'll get there, but it was fighting a losing battle."" Of the hundreds of former sub-postmasters accused of fraud, only 72 have had their names cleared so far Another witness, Vinod Sharma, paid Â£28,000 after a Post Office audit at his newsagents in Balornock, Glasgow. Mr Sharma, who became a sub-postmaster in 1977, said: ""You wake up the middle of the night and think, God, what's happened? What are we going to do - what can we do? ""You soldier on but you do suffer a lot."" Around the year 2000, the Post Office installed a whole load of new software, from tiny branches to big offices right across the UK. Everyone had their system upgraded from the big book ledgers that were used in many places up until that point. What sub-postmasters and the Post Office didn't know at the stage when the system went live was that there were bugs, errors and glitches within it. Gradually, the Post Office realised that money looked like it was going missing from a number of offices. Rather than believe the sub-postmasters, who were saying the money was still physically there in the post office and just looked like it was missing from the system, the Post Office decided to believe the software and use it as evidence in court. A number of whistle-blowers have come forward and said: ""Yes, at different stages we were told there were bugs and errors in the IT process."" So this public inquiry is trying to find out who was responsible, who knew and why those convictions carried on happening - even when the Post Office, and indeed the government, eventually knew what was going on behind the scenes. Although 72 former sub-postmasters in the UK have had their names cleared so far, many are yet to receive compensation. In 2007, Mary Philp was suspended by the Post Office over allegations of missing funds at her sub-post office branch in Auchtermuchty, Fife. She died in 2018, at the age of 83, before the first court case was won by the sub-postmasters. Former sub-postmistress Mary Philp died in 2018, at the age of 83, before the first court case was won Her daughter Myra, who worked with her mother at the Auchtermuchty branch in 2001, said she was a proud and honest woman and the accusations had a devastating impact on her. Myra said: ""It totally destroyed her, to be accused of something she wasn't doing. ""My mum tried everything to point out there was some kind of error. Not to be believed, and to be treated that way, meant she lost her confidence. ""She didn't work again and any time anyone mentioned it to her, she would well up and cry. ""Somebody should be made to stand up and pay for it. ""Not just financially. They need to take responsibility and they need to take it more quickly."" Further inquiry witnesses will include Keith Macaldowie, who ran a post office in Greenock until he was forced to resign in 2011. An audit had uncovered a Â£10,000 shortfall which was later found to be caused by problems with the Post Office's Horizon IT system. Mr Macaldowie told BBC Scotland the ""massive injustice"" had life-changing effects on his mental health. He said: ""This is actually the first time I've talked about it in the 11 years since it happened - I tried to keep it quiet. ""But I have social anxieties through it, I have depression through it and I'm on medication. ""The justice system is innocent until proven guilty, but according to the Post Office it's guilty until proved innocent. ""And you couldn't prove yourself innocent because you couldn't get your hands on any of the evidence to then go through it.""

Pub talk could be key to banker's doorstep murder,"Alistair Wilson was shot on the doorstep of his family home almost 18 years ago Conversations in a pub in the days leading up to the murder of a father-of-two could be significant in solving the case, police have said. Bank manager Alistair Wilson was shot on the doorstep of his home in Nairn in 2004. He later died in hospital. Mr Wilson had objected to a large decking area outside the Havelock Hotel opposite his house shortly before he was shot. Detectives believe his objection was openly discussed in the hotel. Last month, Police Scotland's major investigation team saidit believed the planning dispute was the likely motive for the murder. Detectives said that two new witnesses had come forward with further information about the planning application and the building of the decking. Men seen on beach with gun before fatal shooting Police update description of gunman in 2004 murder Murdered banker's wife 'needs answers' The decking at the Havelock Hotel was built in the spring of 2004 without the required planning consent. It was the subject of a retrospective planning application at the time of the murder. Decking at the Havelock Hotel (pictured in 2008) was built in 2004 without the required planning consent Mr Wilson lodged a written objection with Highland Council, and police said a copy of the letter was sent to the hotel on Friday - two days before the shooting. Det Supt Graeme Mackie said: ""We understand through our inquiries that Alistair's objection was openly talked about in the Havelock Hotel bar from Friday 26 November up until his murder on Sunday 28 November, and would urge anyone who was present over this period, or knows who was there, to please come forward and speak to us. ""We want to know what was being said about it and who else was there as this may be significant to our investigation. ""I would ask anyone with information, no matter how insignificant they think it might be, to please come forward."" Why did an evening end in gunshots? BBC Sounds: The Doorstep Murder On the evening of the shooting, Mr Wilson's wife Veronica answered the door to a stocky man wearing a baseball cap who asked for her husband by name. Mr Wilson, who had been reading to his two sons, went downstairs to speak to the man and was handed an empty blue envelope with the name Paul on it. Mr Wilson went inside briefly and then returned to the door for a second time when he was shot.

DUP threatens to stop assembly functioning,"Sir Jeffrey Donaldson says his party has still to decide whether it will support the election of a new assembly speaker The DUP has refused to say if it will support the election of a new Speaker when the Northern Ireland Assembly meets on Friday. It is due to be the first order of business after the assembly election, which saw Sinn FÃ©in win the most seats for the first time. The assembly cannot function if a speaker is not elected. Sinn FÃ©in's Michelle O'Neill accused DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson of holding society to ransom. The DUP - Northern Ireland's second-largest party by assembly seats after the 5 May election - said it would not nominate ministers to form a new executive until its concerns about the Northern Ireland Protocol - the post Brexit trading arrangements for Northern Ireland - are resolved. The protocol is an issue under fresh scrutiny following the elections to the Northern Ireland Assembly. The elections cemented a majority for assembly members who accept the protocol, including the new largest party, the republican party Sinn FÃ©in. On Wednesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the protocol was ""not working for the balance of the Good Friday Agreement"". The protocol, part of the government's Brexit deal with the European Union, was designed to ensure free trade could continue across the Irish land border by keeping Northern Ireland aligned with the bloc's single market for goods. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the Northern Ireland protocol had undermined the Good Friday Agreement However, it has faced criticism from some unionists who argue it has undermined Northern Ireland's position in the UK by placing additional checks on some goods crossing the Irish Sea. What is the Northern Ireland Protocol? The managing director of Marks & Spencer in Ireland and Northern Ireland warned the time needed to process goods travelling this route to Northern Ireland could increase seven-fold if the protocol was implemented in full without the current mitigations. ""If the easements weren't in place for us, every vehicle would take another seven hours with 20 people working on it, that is a significant difference for Northern Ireland,"" Sacha Berendji told a Lords sub-committee on Wednesday. He said the changes brought about by Brexit had cost the company about Â£30m to continue to supply both parts of the island. Sir Jeffrey told BBC News NI his party's assembly members (MLAs) would attend Stormont on Friday to sign the membership roll, but that a decision still had to be made about the election of a Speaker. The prime minister told BBC News that the protocol's rejection by much of the unionist community means ""we have to fix it"". ""I don't think it needs to be a big drama,"" he added. Earlier, Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said comments by the UK government abouttaking unilateral action on the Northern Ireland Protocolhad gone down ""really badly"" across the EU. This video can not be played Irish Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney believes a ""landing zone"" is possible on the NI Protocol Mr Coveney said he believed there was a ""landing zone"" for progress, but that this should come through partnership ""as opposed to grandstanding, threats and unilateral action which doesn't help anybody"". The US administration said it urged the parties to continue dialogue ""to resolve differences and bring negotiations to a successful conclusion"". ""We recognize that there have been challenges over the implementation of the Northern Ireland Protocol and that talks between the UK and EU to resolve these continue,"" a spokesperson for the State Department continued. ""The best path forward is a pragmatic one that requires courage, cooperation, and leadership."" The election of a new Speaker needs cross-community support from both unionist and nationalist members. A new Speaker would mean assembly business could take place for up to six months, even in the absence of a functioning executive. The latest impasse comes after the 5 May election cemented a majority for assembly members who accept the Northern Ireland Protocol, including the new largest party, republicans Sinn FÃ©in. No Speaker is elected on Friday There would be no debates, committees or private member bills, nor assembly scrutiny of ministers There can also be no appointment of a first and deputy first minister The current ministers can continue to oversee their departments in a caretaker capacity, however, they do so without being part of an executive, limiting their powers A Speaker is elected, but the DUP do not nominate for deputy first minister: MLAs can take up their roles and can hold debates, sit on committees and hold ministers to account However, no deputy first minister means no first minister as this is a joint office Without the positions, there is no executive to take new decisions on matters such as the budget Ministers can continue in a caretaker capacity to head up their departments If there is no agreement to elect a Speaker, this can still happen within a six-month period A Speaker is elected and the DUP nominate for deputy first minister: This would mean Northern Ireland has an assembly of MLAs and an executive of ministers The executive parties can examine issues such as a programme for government and the budget D'Hondt, the process for selecting how many ministers each party is entitled to, can take place to re-allocate portfolios MLAs can also become chairs, deputy chairs and committee members through this process Debates, scrutiny, private member legislation and other routine matters of devolved government can resume Sir Jeffrey said he believed the pressure his party was bringing to bear on the issue of the protocol was beginning to have an impact. ""It's action I want to see and until I see that action and I'm satisfied that it deals with the issues that need to be dealt with in relation to the removal of that internal border within the United Kingdom, I can't make a decision [on returning to government] until I see what is going to happen here,"" he said. ""The government has to act."" Speaking after meeting Mr Coveney, Ms O'Neill said Sir Jeffrey's comments were ""not good enough"" and accused the DUP of holding society to ransom. ""I'll make this call to him again today, join the rest of the parties who will be there on Friday, who will be there to elect a speaker, who will be there to nominate ministers for positions, who will be there to get down to business,"" she said. Sinn FÃ©in deputy leader Michelle O'Neill accused the DUP of holding society to ransom Ms O'Neill added that the protocol was here to stay and accused the British government of ""pandering to the DUP"". Naomi Long, leader of the Alliance Party, said any unilateral action by the British government would be ""utterly reckless"". ""We are very clear on what they [the government] should be doing - they should be engaging very intensively with the European Union and any change they make to the protocol needs to be mutually agreed by the UK and EU,"" Mrs Long said.

THE ASSEMBLY:How power-sharing works in Northern Ireland RESULTS:The assembly election in maps and charts Before his meeting with Mr Coveney, Doug Beattie, leader of the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP), said the Irish foreign minister knew there was a ""landing zone"" for sorting out unionist concerns with the protocol. ""That landing site is no checks on goods from Great Britain to Northern Ireland,"" he said. Mr Beattie said that despite these issues, it didn't give the DUP ""the excuse to stay out of government"". Colin McGrath, who was elected for the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) in South Down, said the election of a Speaker was necessary to ensure ministers could be held to account. If the move is blocked, he told BBC News NI's Talkback programme: ""The DUP need to go off and consider can they legitimately use the word democratic at the start of their name."" On Tuesday,the UK rejected EU plans aimed at reducing the impact of the post-Brexit treaty for Northern Ireland, saying they would make things worse. The EU claimed the proposals would reduce paperwork and checks on goods entering NI from Great Britain. But the government said they would ""worsen the current trading arrangements"". The UK verdict was part of an escalating dispute which could soon see the government scrapping parts of the deal. Sinn FÃ©in: What happens now in Northern Ireland?

Save my tooth or heat my house - carer,"This video can not be played Patients are faced with long delays and unaffordable bills ""I had to choose between heating our house or saving my tooth,"" says mum-of-two and carer Melanie Fudge-Horton. She needed root canal and a crown, but didn't have an NHS dentist and was at the end of a long waiting list. And after being told it would cost Â£1,000 to save the tooth, she paid the cheaper option of Â£50 to have it extracted instead. The Welsh government said it had allocated an additional Â£2m to help NHS patients access treatment. Melanie and husband Marc are full-time carers for their son Thomas, 24, who has Asperger's syndrome, and daughter Elphie, six, who has autism. Melanie called more than 20 NHS dentists near her home in Abercynon, Rhondda Cynon Taf, before considering the Â£1,000 private treatment. How easy is it to see your dentist? 'I pulled out 11 teeth as no dentist was available' ""With the cost of living rising there was no way I could afford it,"" she said. ""My family and I, we're on benefits, there's no way we have that kind of expendable income. ""So eventually I decided to have the tooth extracted for Â£50."" Melanie said it left her feeling ""a little bit sad"" and like a ""victim of an unfair system"". Melanie Fudge-Horton had a tooth extracted because she couldn't afford private treatment Melanie and her husband Marc are both carers for their children and said ""there is no way"" they could afford private treatment ""I feel if they have room to treat you as a paying customer they should have room to treat you as an NHS patient,"" she said. ""It definitely feels wrong and I do feel robbed, to be honest with you, because had I had access to an NHS dentist I wouldn't have had to make that choice. ""It came to a choice of saving the tooth or keeping the house lit and having a warm house, and, at the end of the day, the family comes first."" Melanie is one of thousands of people in Wales who are on waiting lists to get onto the books of an NHS dentist. Patient 'glued own teeth' as dentists drop NHS work Patients 'might never' get 6-month check-ups again Three Welsh health boards established centralised lists last year and they have more than 11,000 people on them: 8,992 in Cardiff and Vale, 1,330 in Cwm Taf Morgannwg, and 1,255 in Powys. The other four health boards do not know how many people are waiting because the lists are kept by individual practices. The BBC has seen a document sent by the Welsh government to dentists earlier this year which acknowledges that NHS services will not be able to meet ""all the demand"" for dental access. It says patients will have to be prioritised which could mean people with ""healthy mouth and low risk"" waiting for a check-up ""much longer than they have been advised for many years"". On Monday, the patient watchdog for Swansea Baypublished a report,externalwhich found there are ""unacceptable levels of dental access"" in the area meaning many people are living with pain. One person who responded to its survey had resorted to pulling out their own teeth. Tara Pearce moved to west Wales last year and says she has ""mum guilt"" about her children not being able to see a dentist Tara Pearce moved back to Pembrokeshire last July with her husband John and two daughters, Frankie, nine, and Taya, eight, after five years in Essex. She tried to register with an NHS dentist, but there were no spaces available. ""I went miles further afield, and with no joy,"" she said. ""No NHS new patient spaces in any of the dental surgeries from here up to Llanelli."" Tara feels very ""let down"" and has what she calls ""mum guilt"" at not being able to get the girls seen. She is still on a waiting list and will pay privately if and when she has to, although the potential costs are a worry. ""It does feel like a postcode lottery, or first come first served,"" she said. ""It's very unfair that some people have been lucky enough to get it and some people haven't when everyone's entitled to it. ""So it is unfair and it does need to change."" The side of Katie-Louise's face was swollen and she couldn't open her mouth to eat or drink Hairdresser Katie-Louise Howells, from Milford Haven, does have an NHS dentist but they are unable to remove a wisdom tooth that is growing badly. Katie-Louise has two children and, in a single-income family, said there is ""no way"" she can afford to go privately. ""My whole side of my face was swollen, I was unable to open my mouth to eat or drink, I had jaw lock, I had earache, it affected my balance,"" she said. ""It put me in bed for three days, I was unable to work, it affected me being a mother to my children because I'm on my own with them."" Katie-Louise has been referred to another NHS dentist for the operation to be done under general anaesthetic but it is a two-year wait or a big private bill. She said she cannot afford it with ""two children to feed as well as the living expenses of everyday life"". ""I'd have to take out a loan or probably ask to borrow money just to get the problem sorted,"" she said. ""I'm worried because I don't like the thought of being in pain."" British Dental Association's (BDA) Russell Gidney said the Welsh government would need to make ""a lot of extra investment"" to meet the demand for NHS dentistry. ""We have a capped contract on the numbers of treatments that we can do and once we've hit that target there is no more money. ""So, for us to treat more (NHS) patients would literally just be us paying to treat patients."" He said the message he received from negotiations with the Welsh government was ""there is no more money"". ""We need an honest conversation. The conversation that we always have is about NHS dental system that can do all things for all people, which is just disingenuous. ""It physically can't do that until we can start talking about what we can do with the money that we've got for all patients, which might mean, restricting what we can do, or saying that we cannot see everybody."" The BDA estimates the annual budget for general dentistry in NHS primary care in Wales before the pandemic was Â£145m. The Welsh government said the pandemic meant fewer people could be treated but now guidelines had been revised to prioritise at-risk groups and those with urgent problems. It added: ""We have asked health boards to encourage dental practices to recall people who are overdue their routine NHS dental examination and to provide appropriate NHS treatment for all. ""The return of services will continue to be gradual and will depend on capacity within individual practices. ""We are working with the British Dental Association and the wider dental community to reform the contracting arrangements for NHS dental provision. ""This will enable dentists to focus on prevention, providing care for existing patients and include a need to see new NHS patients.""

Judges visit Wrexham as culture bid steps up,"Omo Idegun has organised events for the group Wrexham African Community Wrexham will welcome judges for the 2025 UK City of Culture later as it steps up its bid to win the title. The town is competing against Bradford, County Durham and Southampton to be named City of Culture on 26 May. The panel will visit a youth centre, the Pontcysyllte aqueduct and Wrexham AFC, as the Hollywood star-owned club chase promotion to the Football League. UK Arts Minister Lord Parkinson said even a nomination would have already had an impact on Wrexham. Aerial show for City of Culture celebrations Wrexham 'so proud' to make City of Culture final Culture capital 2025 judges visit Bradford Promotion-chasing Wrexham AFC's owners, Hollywood stars Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney, have helped shine a global spotlight on the town He said the competition was about ""shining a spotlight on places and giving them the opportunity to tell their stories"". ""We've had 20 places bidding this time round so to get to the final four is an accolade in itself and will already have had an impact on Wrexham. ""It's creating that legacy for future generations and building connections, sparking ideas and inspiring people to get involved."" The judges will be shown a mix of Wrexham's science, architecture, modern art, football and ancient history. The Pontcysyllte aqueduct forms a big part of Wrexham's bid Should Wrexham be successful in following Coventry, Hull and Derry/Londonderry, community groups could benefit from hundreds of millions of pounds of investment. With a large number of NHS and care staff from Africa, Omo Idegun set up a group last year which has hosted Christmas parties and carnivals, which she said would hopefully help with a bid. She said: ""We've not been known because we've never had an organisation like this, but now with Wrexham African Community we are making our voice known. ""We're not just taking baby steps - we're taking giant steps because we are lions: we roar and everybody has to listen."" The Rhos Orpheus male voice choir has also been asked to perform to the panel. Rhos Orpheus male voice choir will sing to the panel Richard Huxley, the choir's concert secretary said: ""There is a tradition of choral singing in Wrexham, Rhos and Wales. ""While we recognise and respect that tradition we also sing several modern pieces and the big piece we sang was We Rise Again, which fits very nicely into the slogan of the Wrexham bid, We Rise Together"". Meanwhile, Wrexham indoor market and cultural centre, TÅ· Pawb, has been named as one offive finalists in the Art Fund Museum of the Year 2022,externalwith judges saying it ""celebrates Wrexham's rich history and community spirit"". The winner of the competition, which recognises ""the creativity and resilience of museums"", will receive Â£100,000 with the others receiving Â£15,000. ""The news comes at a hugely exciting time for Wrexham,"" said council chief executive Ian Bancroft. ""There is a palpable buzz around the town at the moment, with a compelling few weeks ahead of us.""

How creativity helped Falklands veterans heal,"This video can not be played Two Falklands veterans describe how creativity helped them through the trauma of war. Will Kevans was always an artist at heart but he never imagined that one day his talent for creating cartoons would help him make sense of the conflict he and other young soldiers were drawn in to when Argentina invaded the British-held Falklands Islands in 1982. His mother had wanted him to follow her path to art college but the rebellious young teenager in Aberystwyth had taken a different route after getting suspended from school and ""ending up never going back"". After getting a job in a supermarket and ""thinking I was rich"", everything changed when the job was converted into a youth training scheme, which meant dole money and a small top-up from his employer. Members of Will's company docked in Sierra Leone on the QE2 With no funds to buy the music and clothing he wanted, he thought: ""That's rubbish, I think I'll join the Army."" Less than two years after he was ""still playing with an Action Man [toy]"" he found himself surrounded by other 18 and 19-year-olds in the Welsh Guards, en route to the Falklands. ""I was as green as they come,"" he remembers. ""I was brought up on an old farm in a cottage and I was naÃ¯ve, I would say. I was into my music, I loved my punk music, my ska music. ""It was quite bizarre really. None of us really knew where the Falklands was as such. We all thought it was in the Outer Hebrides. ""Logistically it seemed like lunacy for south Americans to come all the way to the Outer Hebrides to conduct warfare against us. ""It was quite a surprise when we found it was off the coast of South America."" On Sapper Hill on the Falklands After the long trek south aboard the converted cruise ship QE2, one of his strongest memories of war was getting stuck in the middle of a minefield as troops advanced towards the capital, Stanley. ""There was a Marine behind us who was screaming because he'd lost his foot, and he had to be casevac'd (casualty evacuated) out of there,"" he said. Mines were set off by soldiers moving over the ground behind them and they all had to take cover. ""Suddenly a light went up and we all thought 'this is it now, it's going to be a hail of bullets and end of'. ""We got two guys to get us out of that minefield with bayonets and I think they won a military medal for it. They were combat engineers, literally on their hands and knees, traditional way, probing the ground and it literally took the entire night to get us out of there,"" he said. ""It was a very scary situation to be in and it was freezing cold and we were covered in snow as well, but we didn't want to move because you thought, if I move I'm going to step on a mine and that's it."" One of Will's sketches done during the conflict A searing image of the conflict that has stayed with him was the body of a young Argentine soldier his regiment came across on a road after the surrender was announced in June 1982. Will at work with his sketch book on the Falklands After he left the army, he had a career which encompassed being a musician, a cartoonist, animator and game designer. But it was his wife who persuaded him to use his experiences of war when he started to think about writing about parts of his life, initially planning to focus on his time in bands, and it was to cartoons that he turned to tell his story. ""She said, 'why don't you start with the army, because obviously not everybody's been in a war and that's quite interesting'. ""I'd get into a chat with somebody who hadn't been to the Falklands and I'd tell them all these horrific stories, and they'd go 'blimey'. Part of the cover and a page from A Life in Pieces Soldier reveals unseen Falklands images Horrors and heroism on the Falklands front line ""I'd be scaring people with all this nonsense and I thought I'd obviously got issues with it, so if I can process it and write about it maybe that will be the way to move forward,"" he said. ""I had to research it operationally because my memories of it were pretty sketchy. You spend most of your time trying to forget about something because it's an unpleasant experience and then spend all of your time trying to re-remember it."" Talking to people who had had ""an unpleasant experience"" in the Falklands, as well as dealing with his own memories, was not easy. But out of the memories came his graphic novel, My Life in Pieces: The Falklands War. The bombing of the supply ship Sir Galahad, which led to the deaths of 32 Welsh Guards ""When I produced the book, then I found that people were very taken with it, and it helped people process their own feelings on the Falklands. And because it was coming from me, who was a soldier, it was easier for them to take that,"" he said. ""I think if anybody else had done a cartoon of the Falklands conflict they'd have thought, 'that's a bit tasteless, how can you betray this with cartoons?' ""Well I am a cartoonist and I am a veteran so I can do both of those things."" Nigel hopes a film of his book will use the Brecon Beacons as a stand-in for the Falklands Reliving his own and other people's experiences in print has also helped fellow veteran Nigel ""Spud"" Ely work through unacknowledged trauma from his time serving in the Falklands. A member of 2nd Battalion The Parachute Regiment - 2 Para - when the 1982 war broke out, his regiment was at the centre of one of the most critical battles between Argentina and the UK forces. The fighting at Goose Green saw 2 Para mount an attack against much greater numbers, who were well-established in a good defensive position, and suffer significant losses but ultimately go on to win against the odds. Now the soldier turned author and photojournalist has immortalised the battle in his book Goose Green: The decisive battle of the Falklands War, published to mark the 40th anniversary, and hopes to turn it into a film using Welsh landscapes - which inspired much of his writing - as a setting. Paras commanding officer Lt Col Herbert ""H"" Jones was killed in action at Goose Green and awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross He recalls the arrival on an East Falkland beach as being completely outside his experience. ""We'd never been in landing craft. This was the Royal Marine's business. We were paratroopers, we jumped out of aircraft. ""I do remember being soaking wet, up to my neck in water because the landing craft didn't run up the beach, it had fallen short and we were dropped in the sea,"" he said. Veteran describes firing first Falklands shots Army's main base in Wales saved from closure C Company, which he was assigned to, had to set up the ""start line"" for rifle companies to begin an assault, after which they were held in reserve. It was during this first wave of fighting involving his comrades in A Company that ""a load of the guys got killed"", including the battalion's commanding officer Lt Col Herbert ""H"" Jones, who was awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross, the highest military honour. Another memory is C Company charging downhill towards the settlement of Goose Green as the Argentine forces opened fire. Goose Green, where a decisive battle took place ""We advanced down, bayonets fixed towards the Argentinians - there were trenches there, they were throwing phosphorous bombs... the enemy were so overwhelming with their artillery, with their support mortars. ""They hit us with everything. The noise was so loud for hours and hours; it was just incredible,"" he said. ""I think [an outsider would] think it was a battle from the Second World War. We were coming to the end of the 20th century and we were still fighting an enemy with Second World War tactics, with basically Second World War equipment too. ""The Argentinians had better weapons than us, they had better kit than ours."" Following the conflict, Nigel moved on to the SAS (Special Air Service) and remained in the military into the early 2000s, until capture by enemy forces in Afghanistan gave a new turn to his career, taking him into journalism. Discarded Argentine helmets left behind when soldiers surrendered after Goose Green He worked as a photojournalist in the Middle East, and began writing tales of his military life, publishing a number of books on the subject. But it was once he turned to the subject of the Falklands that he realised how cathartic writing could be, and not just for him. ""To write a book initially helped with the post-traumatic stress which I didn't think I suffered with until I started listening to other people's stories. ""I interviewed 114 guys of which I've taken about 350 of their stories, vignettes and tales,"" he explained. Nigel Ely's experiences informed the writing of his book, Goose Green But it was not an easy process at first. ""They were like a resistance to interrogation. They wouldn't give [their stories] to me in the way I wanted them to so I had to develop my journalistic skills into more interrogator skills to get it out,"" he explained. ""They said to me afterwards, 'I would never have spoken to anybody else about it and I'm so grateful that you did and I'm so grateful that you asked me for my stories'. ""I found that very humbling. I had a few of them in tears. They hadn't given their stories to anyone else."" A grim reminder of war brought back by Nigel from the Falklands A Londoner by birth, Nigel has spent a lot of time in Wales and, speaking surrounded by the Brecon Beacons landscaped which helped unlock his memories of the conflict, says any film on the Falklands ""has to be made in Wales"". ""Having known the Brecon Beacons for so long, it actually inspired me, and brought those memories back of the Falklands war. ""The Brecon Beacon National Park is the Falklands less the trees. ""I felt it has to be done in Wales purely because of the terrain, and there's a wealth of talent down here. The landscape of the Brecon Beacons evokes the Falklands for Nigel ""[The same distance as] from where I'm sitting, I could see Goose Green 800m to my front. This is exactly the same. This undulating, quite unforgiving terrain which you could twist an ankle on as soon as you get up. ""The fact that the Parachute Regiment trains up here and in Sennybridge greatly helped us in the Falklands. ""Pen y Fan and the Brecon Beacons is like a bit of shrine to the Paras because they spend so much time here. They love it.""

"Cardinal, 90, arrested under Hong Kong security law","Cardinal Joseph Zen waves to demonstrators during the annual pro-democracy protest in 2014 One of the Catholic Church's most senior members has been arrested in Hong Kong for breaking China's national security law, police have confirmed. Cardinal Joseph Zen, 90, is one of four people detained for being associated with a now-defunct organisation that helped protesters in financial need. The others are a Cantopop singer and actor Denise Ho, ex-legislator Margaret Ng, and academic Dr Hui Po Keung. They are accused of colluding with foreign forces. If found guilty, they could face life in prison. Human Rights Watch called it a ""shocking new low for Hong Kong."" Hong Kong Police told the BBC that the group was suspected of appealing to foreign countries or organisations to impose sanctions on Hong Kong, hence threatening China's national security. Cardinal Zen fled Shanghai for Hong Kong after the communists took over China 70 years ago, and is a former bishop of Hong Kong. He has long been a critic of the government in Beijing, speaking out for Catholics in mainland China and for more democracy in Hong Kong. He oncepublicly admonished the Vatican for ""selling out"" to Chinaby forcing bishops to retire in favour of replacements picked by Beijing. ""Arresting a 90-year-old cardinal for his peaceful activities has to be a shocking new low for Hong Kong, illustrating the city's free fall in human rights in the past two years,"" Human Rights Watch said. The Vatican is concerned about the cardinal's arrest, spokesman Matteo Bruni said in a statement. The Catholic Diocese of Hong Kong has also spoken out, saying they are ""extremely concerned about the condition and safety of Cardinal Joseph Zen"". ""We urge the Hong Kong Police and the judicial authorities to handle Cardinal Zen's case in accordance with justice,"" they added. Singer and activist Denise Ho testified at a US Congressional hearing on the pro-democracy protest in 2019 Dr Hui, a scholar with Hong Kong's Lingnan University, was arrested at the airport as he tried to fly to Europe to take up an academic posting, Hong Kong Free Press reports, citing two legal sources. This is the second time Denise Ho has been arrested in as many months - she was detained late last year under the same law. Margaret Ng has also been arrested in the past -in 2021 she was handed a one year suspended sentencefor participating in unauthorised demonstrations. During the hearing, the barrister dismissed her own lawyer and gave such a rousing speech, the court erupted into applause. Hong Kong Police told the BBC the four defendants would be released on bail, but must hand over their passports. They are believed to have been associated with the 612 Humanitarian Relief Fund, which helped pro-democracy protesters pay their legal and medical fees. By Martin Yip, BBC Chinese, Hong Kong Cardinal Zen is someone many Catholics in Hong Kong look up to. He's been seen marching with citizens in protests, and more recently attending court hearings of pro-democracy activists. Some affectionately call him ""Grandpa Cardinal"". One political pundit, Dr Simon Shen, says his arrest will seriously affect relations between China and the Vatican. The Roman Catholic Church has been seeking to improve its relations with Beijing for decades - something Cardinal Zen is not happy about, as he says the rights of Christians in Mainland China are not being looked after in their negotiations. Meanwhile, Beijing's official newspapers in Hong Kong call the Cardinal a ""lawless"" anti-China person. Just after the arrests were made known to the public, one paper published what it calls ""evidence"" of the 612 Fund's ""collusion"" against China. His arrest will inevitably become a yet another sticking point in fraying relations between Hong Kong and the international community, driven by the Beijing-imposed National Security Law. The organisation was disbanded last year after the national security police demanded it hand over sensitive information including details about its members and donors. Hong Kong profile China's new law: Why is Hong Kong worried? Scores of pro-democracy activists and protesters in Hong Kong have been arrested under the national security law since it was imposed by China in 2020. It essentially bans sedition, secession and treason, and therefore makes it easier for authorities to crack down on protesters and punish them. The arrests come days afterthe Chinese government appointed a new hard-line pro-Beijing leader for Hong Kong, John Lee Ka-chiu. ""The arrests... [are] an ominous sign that its crackdown on Hong Kong is only going to escalate,"" Human Rights Watch said.

Ministers pledge votes on neighbours' extensions,"This video can not be played Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove casts doubt on 300,000 homes target Neighbours could be allowed to vote on whether planning permission should be given for developments - such as house extensions - on their street. The ""street votes"" would be an alternative to traditional forms of planning permission. It comes as Michael Gove ditched most of the government's reforms of the planning system in England. Downing Street insisted it was still committed to building 300,000 homes a year by the mid-2020s. Mr Gove earlier told BBC Radio 4's Today programme more homes were needed. But, he added, hitting a ""statistical target"" was not the only measure of success, particularly ""if the homes that are built are shoddy, in the wrong place, don't have the infrastructure required, and are not contributing to beautiful communities"". Is the government meeting its new-homes target? The 300,000 target was a key Conservative pledge at the 2019 general election. Mr Gove's predecessor as Communities Secretary, Robert Jenrick, aimed to meet it by forcing councils to accept new housing developments in designated areas. But the plans sparked a significant Tory backlash,including from former Prime Minister Theresa May, who called them ""ill-conceived"". Some in the party said the policy had contributed to by-election losses in former Conservative heartlands - includingChesham and Amersham- fears that would only have been exacerbated bylast week's local elections results. Now Mr Jenrick's proposals will be dropped in favour of a new Levelling Up and Regeneration Bill,published on Wednesday,external. Other new policies will include: Design codes to let local communities set rules about the layout of new developments and materials which could be used A new infrastructure levy - to be determined locally - to increase funds for projects such as schools, hospitals and roads, by basing the sum on the value of the property when it is sold, rather than when it gets planning permission Digitising the planning system, making plans more accessible online rather than relying on notices on lampposts Labour's shadow levelling up secretary Lisa Nandy said: ""Under the Conservatives housing has become less affordable, spending on rent has sky-rocketed, and homeownership has gone down."" She said the party could ""no longer claim to be the party of homeownership"". Planning reforms paused amid Tory MP anger Why do ministers face a backlash on planning rules? Archaeologists dig in over planning reforms row Michael Gove was confronted by fury inside his own party over planning reforms put forward by his predecessor. So he's junked them. Instead, there's a set of measures designed to give people more say over development in their areas. Mr Gove has suggested communities will be more open to new housing if it's not imposed on them - if it's ""beautiful"" and ""democratic"". But having ditched more radical reforms, the government may well struggle to meet its own target for building new homes. All the while, there are tens of thousands of people on housing waiting lists, families living in unsuitable or temporary accommodation, and many others unable to afford to get on the property ladder. There are other measures in the Queen's Speech designed to improve the housing market - giving renters more protection and suggestions of a clampdown on empty second homes. It's a complex problem of which the planning system is only one part. But the reality is that the country is facing a housing crisis, and so far successive governments have failed to find a solution. In Boris Johnson's first year in office, only 243,000 new homes were supplied,according to the House of Commons Library,external- falling to 216,000 in 2020/21, partly because of the disruption caused by the pandemic. Research conducted by the BBC in 2020found the difference between the housing stock in England and the number of homes needed was more than one million. Robert Jenrick told MPs the government was likely to continue missing its target by a ""country mile"" without more action. The Conservatives pledged to build 300,000 homes a year in England by the mid-2020s as part of its 2019 manifesto Mr Gove said communities had been ""understandably resistant"" to new developments when factors like the appearance of the buildings and the supporting infrastructure - like GP surgeries and schools - were not included in the plans. But he believed more people would be in favour of new housing under his proposals, adding: ""It shouldn't be a case that we impose. It is important that even as we seek to improve housing supply, we also seek to build communities that people love and are proud of."" Labour MP Clive Betts - who chairs the housing select committee - called the ""street vote"" plan a gimmick, telling the BBC it was not possible for communities to ""decide absolutely everything"" about urban planning in their area. He told the BBC the process of building new housing should be simplified, with local people involved in decisions about where homes might be placed much earlier than at the planning permission stage. Before proposals can be put to a local vote, they will be examined against a set of nationally prescribed development rules, which are to be agreed in due course, the government said. Development will go ahead only if the proposal is endorsed by a ""supermajority"" of residents in a referendum. The precise thresholds for approval would be set out in regulations in due course, the government added. Around 340,000 new homes are needed in England each year - 145,000 of them should be affordable, research for the National Housing Federation in 2019 said In 2020, the Affordable Housing Commission found that more than half of 18 to 24 year-olds still lived with family members; 18% continuing to do so when aged 25 to 34 From 2010 to 2020, more than 464,000 affordable homes were built; 114,000 of these were social homes (housing provided for people on low incomes or with particular needs) In England, an average house cost Â£292,000 (March 2022, ONS) The latest official figure for median monthly rent (for 2021) was Â£755, the highest ever recorded Are you struggling to get on the housing ladder?

Sri Lanka's ex-PM flees to naval base amid protests,"Mobs have attacked buses as well as property belonging to the Rajapaksas and other politicians Security forces are deployed across Sri Lanka with orders to shoot looters on sight amid continuing protests at the government's handling of a devastating economic crisis. President Gotabaya Rajapaksa has vowed to restore order, in his first national speech since protests began last month. Ignoring calls to resign, he offered to cede some powers to parliament and name a prime minister, but set no timetable. His brother quit as PM on Monday amid fury over soaring prices and shortages. Sri Lankans are desperate as basic items like food and fuel run out or become unaffordable. ""We have come to the protest site despite the curfew,"" one protester, Chandrasekaran, told BBC Tamil in Colombo. ""We are suffering even now. There is no kerosene, no petrol, no diesel, and no power."" Despite a nationwide curfew, there have been two consecutive nights of arson attacks by mobs - many have targeted property belonging to the Rajapaksas and other politicians who are blamed for the mess the country is in. Shops near Colombo were torched, as well as a resort owned by the son of former Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa. Mr Rajapaksa, the president's elder brother and a two-time former president,Â is holed up in a naval base in the north-east for his own safety, the military has confirmed. This video can not be played ""I never wanted him"" - people from Sri Lanka's protests on the country's leaders At least nine people have been killed and about 200 injured in unrest since Monday.Â It began when government supporters attacked protesters who are demanding thatÂ Gotabaya RajapaksaÂ leave office. Opposition politicians have warned the violence could have been staged to give the army a pretext to take power. Rumours of a possible coup have been fuelled by the presence of large numbers of troops with armoured vehicles on the streets. But the military have denied any such move is planned. ""When there is a dangerous situation in the country, powers are given to the military to deal with it,"" Defence Secretary Kamal Gunaratne told a news conference. ""Don't ever think that we are trying to capture power. The military has no such intentions."" Sri Lanka had already seen weeks of protests over its dire financial situation, which has caused the Sri Lankan rupee to plunge, provoking severe shortages of basic items such as food, fuel and medical supplies. The worst trouble overnight was in the north of the capital, Colombo, where rival groups set fire to shops in the town of Negombo. On Monday night, mobs burned more than 50 houses belonging to politicians, while a controversial museum dedicated to the Rajapaksa family was also razed to the ground in their traditional heartland, Hambantota, in the country's south. Soldiers and police are under orders to shoot anyone damaging property or threatening life Shops, businesses and offices were shut for a third day on Wednesday under a nationwide curfew in place until Thursday morning. Another protester told the BBC the president's speech on Wednesday was long overdue. ""Where were you for the last 30 days? People don't have medicine, people don't have food, the entire country's at a standstill,"" Kavindya Thennakoon said. ""The reforms he's suggesting are not what we need. What we need right now is for [the president] to resign from office... It baffles my mind that Gotabaya Rajapaksa doesn't understand that."" The streets of the capital, Colombo, bear the evidence of this week's rioting - a heavy police presence, troops on the streets, and overturned and burnt buses after Monday's violence. Why Sri Lankans want their rulers thrown out The divisions behind Sri Lanka's united protests Sri Lankans left desperate over medicine hikes Nonetheless, protesters continue to gather despite the curfew at Galle Face Green. They insist President Rajapaksa has grossly mismanaged the economy and must stand aside. He is the last Rajapaksa family member in office and the resignation of his brother as prime minister did nothing to placate demonstrators or bring calm. Protesters blame Gotabaya (right) and Mahinda Rajapaksa for the current crisis President Rajapaska says he is holding talks with other political parties aimed at forming a unity government. But the main opposition  has said it will not be part of the interim administration unless the president stands down. At present, there is no clarity on which political parties might come together to form such a government. The political stalemate comes as Sri Lanka attempts to iron out a bailout package with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) - the island's $81bn economy is near bankruptcy. It has suspended its foreign debt payments, largely because it cannot service loans from China that paid for massive infrastructure projects. While the pandemic hit the vital tourism sector and shrank Sri Lanka's earnings and foreign exchange reserves, experts say problems have been exacerbated by populist tax cuts in 2019 and a disastrous ban on chemical fertilisers in 2021 that devastated crop yields. Protesters gathered in front of Trincomalee Naval Base in the north-east after reports that Mahinda Rajapaksa had fled there with his family after escaping from his Colombo residence when it was besieged by crowds on Monday night. The military confirmed on Wednesday that he was inside the base. ""We took Mahinda to the naval base for safety reasons,"" the defence secretary said. Earlier, there had been rumours that Mr Rajapaksa and others in the family had fled to India, which the Indian High Commission in Colombo denied. Anbarasan Ethirajan, BBC News, Colombo Sri Lankans are still reeling from the violence that has erupted. Many politicians are sheltering in safe houses or avoiding appearing in public. ""It is not at all safe, particularly for politicians on the government side,"" Nalaka Godahewa, until recently media minister, told the BBC. His house was among those torched. Mahinda Rajapaksa, once celebrated by the majority Sinhalese as a war hero for defeating the Tamil Tiger rebels, has suddenly become a villain. Many blame his supporters for targeting anti-government protesters, which then set off a chain of violent events. The Rajapaksas have always stood together, but this time, their differences are out in the open. The problem appears to have started after Gotabaya asked the family patriarch Mahinda to ""take one for the team"" and resign. How the family, who have dominated Sri Lankan politics for years, overcome this crisis is now an open question. Why is Sri Lanka in crisis?

Windfall tax on energy firms still an option,"A windfall tax on big oil and gas companies to help tackle the soaring cost of living has not been ruled out, sources close to the chancellor say. Officials say Rishi Sunak is still open to the idea if firms do not reinvest their bumper profits in the UK. Current policy is still based on the tax deterring investment in new oil and gas fields and green technologies. Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned last week it could put future UK energy security at risk. However, the Treasury is now pointing to comments Rishi Sunak made in an interview with Mumsnet in April in which he said ""nothing's ever off the table in these things"". The chancellor warned that if sufficient investment was not forthcoming ""then of course that [windfall tax] is something I would look at"". The fact that Treasury officials are using the chancellor's comments in April as the primary text in the study of windfall tax probability is further evidence of the ""leeway"" they have on the policy, one official said today. The question remains how much investment would be enough to make the chancellor put the windfall tax stick away? The chancellor and business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng have previously welcomed pledges by BP to invest Â£18bn in the UK by the end of 2030 and Shell to invest Â£20-25bn in the next 10 years. However, neither of their commitments has materially increased as their profits have ballooned. Shell made a record Â£7bnin the first three months of this yearwhile BP reported a decade high Â£5bn. BP boss Bernard Looney, who famously described the company as a ""cash machine"", told journalists that it would proceed with all of their UK investments with or without a windfall tax. Shell boss Ben van Beurden wouldn't be drawn on whether it would scale back investment but did say Shell's programme of investments would be helped by ""a stable tax and regulatory environment"". Windfall taxes are not something in this chancellor's economic DNA. Oil and gas prices are extremely volatile and when BP and Shell were making record losses when oil prices collapsed, there was no clamour to help them out. The boss of Centrica, Chris O'Shea has likened a windfall tax to ""burning the furniture to keep warm"" - a quick fix but a poor long-term decision. But the chronic squeeze on household incomes has seen some perhaps unexpected advocates for a windfall tax. On Tuesday, Tesco chairman John Allan told the BBC that the case for one was overwhelming in the face of the genuine hardship he was seeing reflected in stores. An oil and gas industry executive conceded ""it's clear this debate is not going away. I don't think the chancellor wants to do it but the political pressure is clearly there"" The evolution of a policy U-turn starts with a few mutations, some of which are shut down and others allowed to persist as it slowly takes a new shape. We are not there yet - but to mix metaphors further, officials seem to be ""rolling the pitch"" before potentially delivering a change. One of the biggest problems may be designing the mechanism to impose the tax. BP and Shell have paid almost zero tax on their North Sea operations over the last few years as prices have been much lower and they are allowed to offset the cost of decommissioning old North Sea facilities against any profits made. Taxing worldwide income would mean taxing BP and Shell on profits made in places like the US, activities they will have paid US tax on already. While big global players like BP and Shell could take such a tax in their stride, UK waters are also home to smaller firms who may be deterred from investing by the prospect of a tax raid. Creating a minimum revenue threshold - as the government did with its digital services tax - could exempt them while hitting the deep pockets of the likes of BP and Shell. The other question is whether it is purely retrospective - and if so, how far back in history do you go. The shareholders of the company now may not be the same as the ones that enjoyed the windfall, so there's a risk in going back too far. However, tax experts say that if you made it purely retrospective, then you could argue it is no disincentive to future investment as long as it comes with a credible promise it's a one-off occurrence. It's likely that these are the exact conversations going on inside the Treasury right now.

Attack on boy classed as racially motivated,"In a video filmed shortly after he was struck, Antwon can be seen bleeding An attack on a boy who was struck with an oar is now being treated as a racially motivated assault. Police officers were called to Bristol's Conham River Park on 26 March after a woman pushed Antwon, 12, during a dispute and hit him with the paddle. According to police she said she acted in self-defence and his family was told no further action would be taken. But the force said after reviewing the case and meeting Antwon's family, it now wanted to hear from witnesses. In a statement, Avon and Somerset Police said the initial decision to take no action was ""based on evidence gathered at the time"". ""A review was immediately launched after senior officers became aware of the decision to close this case with no further action being taken, following public concern,"" it added. Antwon's father Tyran said he felt let down by Avon and Somerset Police's initial decision to take no further action On Monday, the force's Bristol commander, Supt Mark Runacres, along with Ch Insp Mike Buck and a community leader, met Antwon and his father Tyran to apologise for the family initially being informed by letter that no action would be taken.

""We have complete empathy with his family and listened carefully to what he had to say.

UK ticket holder wins Â£184m EuroMillions jackpot,"Tuesday's winning ticket will net the ticket holder Â£184,262,899.10. A UK ticket holder has claimed the Â£184m EuroMillions prize, the country's biggest National Lottery jackpot. Tuesday's winning numbers were 3, 25, 27, 28 and 29 - plus Lucky Star numbers 4 and 9. Camelot, the firm behind the National Lottery, said a single ticket-holder had come forward to claim the ""life-changing and record-breaking win"". It means 15 UK players have now won jackpots of more than Â£100m since EuroMillions launched in 2004. ""This is absolutely incredible news,"" said Camelot's Andy Carter, senior winners' adviser at the National Lottery, adding: ""We're ecstatic that we've now received a claim. ""Our focus now is on supporting the ticket holder through the process and helping them start to enjoy their truly life-changing and record-breaking win."" The claim will now go through a validation process to ensure terms and conditions are met and once the ticket has been validated the winner can choose whether or not to remain anonymous. This is the second EuroMillions jackpot won in the UK this year, with the Â£109 million jackpot from the draw on 4 February claimed a few days later, when the winner chose not to go public. Until Tuesday's result, the biggest lottery win in the UK was Â£170m in October 2019. The winner chose to remain anonymous. Colin and Chris Weir, who won Â£161m in 2011, are the biggest winners to have gone public. Mr Weirused his fortune to take over his favourite football club, Partick Thistle, with the intention of giving ownership to the fans.  Â£170mBritain's richest ever lottery winner stayed anonymous after their win in October 2019. Â£161mColin and Chris Weir (pictured) from North Ayrshire, Scotland in 2011. Â£148mAdrian and Gillian Bayford, from Suffolk, in 2012. Â£123mAnonymous UK ticket-holder in June 2019. Â£122mAnonymous UK ticket-holder in April 2021. The couple, from North Ayrshire,announced they were divorcingin 2019 after 38 years of marriage, and months laterMr Weir died, aged 71. The transferral of the ownership of Partick Thistle is currently in a state of flux, following a dispute between fans, the Thistle board and the company that currently holds Mr Weir's shares. Frances Connolly, who - along with husband Patrick - won Â£115m in 2019, making them the lottery's eighth biggest winners, revealed last month she had given away more than half of her fortune. The 55-year-old, from Hartlepool, said helping others ""gives you a buzz"", adding: ""I'm addicted to it now."" However, even Tuesday's winnings are small change compared with the Powerball and Mega Millions lottery games held in the US, which offer huge sums in a league of their own - albeit not tax-free, as is the case with winnings in Europe. Powerball holds the current world record for the largest lottery prize awarded. In January 2016, the advertised jackpot stood at $1.586bn (Â£1.2bn), surpassing the $1bn threshold for the first time - the winnings were ultimately shared among three ticket holders. The biggest individual win came two years later, with a single ticket holder from South Carolina pocketing a Mega Millions jackpot of $1.537bn - $878m (Â£709m) after tax.

Relentless and unbearable â the condition affecting one in fourSpecialists warn the NHS is not set up to deal with such complex conditions.,"Jen Proudler lives in constant pain and is desperate for a better way to manage her condition. Relentless. Unbearable. Overwhelming. These are just some of the words used by the thousands of people who have revealed their battle with long-term, persistent pain. Anexclusive survey of over 4,000 adults aged 16-75 for BBC News, carried out by research company Ipsos, suggests that a quarter of people in the UK are living with chronic pain - an often hidden and misunderstood condition. And pain specialists warn the health service is not set up to deal with such complex conditions. They say the treatments on offer are decades behind the science, leaving millions of patients without the support they need to manage their pain. Chronic pain - defined as pain that lasts longer than three months - can drastically change people's lives. It can be caused by a physical problem - such as a slipped disc, but can also occur with no clear cause - known as primary pain. It destroys careers, breaks up relationships, steals independence and denies people the futures they had imagined. Jen Proudler says chronic pain has left her grieving for ""the person she was"". It started four years ago with sporadic back pain, which she managed with the help of hot baths and paracetamol. Now she relies on opioid patches, anti-inflammatories, nerve pain medications and beta-blockers just to get through the day. ""It has flipped everything upside down,"" she says. ""I feel I've lost every part of my life. I've lost me."" Jen, 38, who lives with her partner in Farsley near Leeds, was working as a dental hygienist and had a busy social life when she first started experiencing pain in February 2018. Jen Proudler used to work as a dental hygienist - a job she loved Her doctor said it was a problem with a disc in her back and advised taking some time off. Jen rested for about eight weeks, then went back to work. The pain hadn't gone away but she felt she needed to get back to ""some kind of normality"". ""There were days when it was really bad, but I have this attitude of battling through it, because that's what you do,"" she says. But nine months after the pain first began, Jen was driving to work when she felt the most excruciating pain. ""It was how I would imagine being kicked in the back by a horse."" Later that day she lost all sensation in her right leg. That was the last time she made it to work. After several incorrect diagnoses, Jen was eventually told by a neurosurgeon that she had a ""pretty massive"" far lateral disc herniation in her spine - a slipped disc that then compresses the nerves around it. But by then something was going on - her body's defence system had gone into overdrive in response to the agony she was experiencing. The pain has now spread around her body - Jen has burning pins and needles sensations down her leg, as well as sharp pain, as if being cut by a razor. Sometimes it's so bad, she can't even bear any fabric to touch it. ""Our nervous system becomes more and more protective, it feels danger and sends warning signals - and those warning signals contribute to the pain,"" explains Dr Chris Barker, clinical director of an NHS community pain service in Ainsdale, Merseyside. He says such pain can be hard to diagnose, and the difficulty of getting the correct treatment can make things worse. ""Incorrect diagnoses, delayed diagnoses, poor experiences in and out of the health system, not being believed - all of these can contribute to a more intense experience of pain."" Dr Barker says the NHS is not set up to deal with such a complex condition, despite the fact it is so common. ""The prevalence of pain is huge. It dwarfs most other conditions."" Dr Chris Barker leads a team of psychologists, pharmacists and physiotherapists The BBC study is the most recent snapshot - previous studies have found chronic pain affects between 20-50% of the UK - and the prevalence may be even higher in older age groups. Persistent pain that lasts more than three months, despite medication or other forms of treatment Secondary chronic pain is a pain which tends to be caused by another condition, for example, arthritis, endometriosis, cancer pain Primary chronic pain is a condition in its own right - there is no known condition other than the pain itself - this can include conditions such as fibromyalgia or complex regional pain syndrome Chronic pain is often confused with acute pain - a short-term pain such as a broken bone or a torn muscle Latest guidelines from the health regulator National Institute of Health and Care Excellence,external(NICE) say chronic primary pain should not be treated with opioids, or even paracetamol, while inScotland, opioids can be prescribed for chronic pain,externalin certain cases. Yet the results from BBC's Ipsos survey suggest nearly a quarter of those who live with chronic pain are currently taking opioids - ranging from medication such as codeine to more powerful painkillers like morphine and fentanyl. Opioids are useful for short-term, acute pain, but there is little evidence they help long-term, persistent pain. Despite this, opioid prescribing more than doubled between 1998 to 2018. It prompted the MHRA, the UK's medicine regulator, to issue stronger warnings around the risk of addiction and overdose. Our research suggests that more than 40% of those currently using opioids began taking them over five years ago, before these warnings were issued. Sitting at her kitchen table, packets of pills stacked up nearby, Jen says every day now revolves around managing her pain. Despite the support of her GP, she is struggling to see a way forward. She says the medication helps her function, but she worries she's running out of options in the long term. Pain specialists believe the science calls for a different approach involving more support, more tailored care and most importantly, more options of how to cope with such a life-changing condition. Chronic pain: Antidepressants not painkillers recommended Dr Cathy Stannard, clinical lead on persistent pain for NICE, says medication like opioids has very little benefit for people with certain types of chronic pain. She fears millions of patients are not getting the bespoke treatment needed for such a complex condition. But the other options are a difficult sell to a patient in distress - especially in an under-pressure health service where they often don't get the chance to build up a trusting, empathetic relationship. ""People who are living with pain very understandably present with high levels of distress. When they say, 'Are you going to leave me in pain?' it is very difficult to say 'Yes.' It is always with the best intentions that we prescribe medicines, but often, it is a response to distress rather than a rational clinical decision."" Patients tend to need the support of their GP, physiotherapists, psychologists and pharmacists. Depending on the condition, medication can be helpful but may only be part of the treatment - other elements that help include: Exercise Physical therapies (hot or cold packs, massage, hydrotherapy) Physiotherapy Acupuncture Psychological therapies (trauma therapy, cognitive behaviour therapy, meditation) Community support groups Dr Stannard stresses the NICE guidelines were not written to take medication away from people who feel it is helping them. The problem, she says, is the lack of options or tailored treatment for such a complex condition - and too often medication becomes the only answer, instead of part of it. And no-one should stop or change their medication without speaking to their doctor. Benjamin Ellis, a consultant rheumatologist and senior policy advisor for the charity Versus Arthritis, agrees, and says that while opioids can help people manage some conditions like osteoarthritis, too often they are seen as a long-term answer. ""The health system is set up to support the prescribing of medication rather than supporting patients to access other treatments - physical activity, programmes to help people with their mental health, community support, peer support - they're not so readily available, and even where they are, they're not well connected with health services."" Lorraine English's story illustrates the potential dangers of being prescribed opioids long term. She was a busy single mum with four kids, working as a teaching assistant, when she started to notice pain that had started in her neck and spread into her head and back. It led to her taking high doses of opioids, including morphine, for 12 years - at times she says she felt like her life was over. ""It was so frightening, so isolating"". With the help of her GP, Lorraine has weaned herself off opioids Lorraine, from Burnage, south Manchester, was eventually diagnosed with degenerative disc disease, osteoarthritis and fibromyalgia - a condition which causes all-over body pain and extreme tiredness. ""I would get nerve pain shooting through my head and it would cause migraines, light-sensitivity - just my heel touching the floor would send pain up into my head."" As the pain continued, her opioid dose increased, while her ability to cope decreased. Eventually she had to give up work, taking pill after pill to beat what is known as ""breakthrough pain"" - a flare-up of pain despite being on huge doses of painkillers. For the last three years of her life on morphine, Lorraine was unable to function - bed-bound, existing in a fog of medication, her life ruled by pain. ""It's like being in a medicated coma and you can't reach out to anybody, because you're not even aware anyone's out there. I felt like that for years, just laid in bed with my kids checking on me, asking, 'You okay?'"" Lorraine kept a pain diary in 2017 which she hoped would help but just reminds her of how difficult her life was. Lorraine says she realised that she needed to reduce her medication - not only was she struggling to function, but she felt it was making the pain worse. It took nearly a year, but with the help of her GP, Lorraine has gradually tapered off her opioid medication, and the pain has reduced. Now opioid-free, she says she has learned to ""embrace"" the pain she still feels, and understand her body's limits. ""No matter how much pain I am in, I want to be able to manage it so I can hug my grandkids,"" she says. People who live with chronic pain have told us how difficult it is to access any specialist services. Our research suggests that nearly a quarter (23%) of those living with chronic pain are on waiting lists for surgery or a pain management programme. An NHS spokesperson said more clinical pharmacists and trained staff are being recruited and will be based at GP surgeries so patients can get access to specialist care and be ""offered alternatives to medication where appropriate"". There are areas of the UK which are offering a whole patient approach, like at Dr Barker's clinic in Ainsdale, Merseyside, where he leads a team of pharmacists, physiotherapists and psychologists. This video can not be played At the age of 13 Luke woke up in horrific pain and a decade on his condition is still undiagnosed. Over the last 20 years, he says, the scientific understanding of pain - how our brains respond, how we process it - has been transformed. Hurt does not always equal harm, he explains, and someone can be in pain without any physical injury. ""Our traditional model of thinking about pain is about MRI scans and looking for structural things - the problem is we interpret that to mean that's going to be the cause of pain."" ""While youâre laughing youâre not crying"" says Kev, who runs a chronic pain peer support group in Merseyside Chronic pain is far more complex than that - an overly sensitised nervous system can change a normal signal from one of the body's sensors into a threat signal which our brain then interprets as pain. There may be many complex reasons why the nervous system has been put on ""red alert"", he says. If people are dealing with trauma, stress or grief, that can contribute to chronic pain. A Life Of Pain The BBC News investigation unearths huge numbers of people living with chronic pain. In an exclusive documentary, Dominic Hughes hears stories from those in pain, across the UK. Watch on BBC iPlayer now. This is why, Dr Barker says, sharing experiences can play a vital role when living with pain. Many of his patients attend Pain Clinic Plus, a peer support group at his clinic. ""People tend to become isolated because they can't do what they used to do, so people stop phoning them,"" says Kev Howard, one of the organisers, who has lived with pain for years following a shoulder injury. ""It's so easy to sit at home and take a pill and fall asleep. The other way to go is to pop into groups similar to this, and basically have a laugh - because while you're laughing you're not crying.""

Sub-postmasters wrongly told to pay back moneyThe Post Office scandal inquiry holds sessions in Scotland where it has been hearing from victims.Scotland,"Louise Dar paid the Post Office Â£44,000 which was wrongly deemed to have gone missing from her business Former sub-postmasters have told an inquiry they had to pay tens of thousands to the Post Office after being wrongly accused of fraud. More than 700 sub-postmasters and mistresses in the UK were accused of theft and false accounting because of flaws in the organisation's IT system. Some ended up in prison while others lost their jobs. The scandal has been described as ""the most widespread miscarriage of justice in UK history"". A public inquiry into the cases, which date back to between 2000 and 2014, opened in London earlier this year. It is now hearing two days of evidence in Glasgow. The Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission - which looks into miscarriages of justice - has written to 73 potential victims in Scotland and is currently investigating eight cases. Post Office scandal ruined lives, inquiry hears Post Office scandal: 'My mother was honest' Why were hundreds of sub-postmasters prosecuted? 'I want someone else jailed like I was' Louise Dar told the inquiry she was forced to pay Â£44,000 which was wrongly deemed to have gone missing from her sub-post office in Lenzie, East Dunbartonshire. Mrs Dar, 39, said she and her family regularly worked late into the night trying to clear up shortfalls which didn't actually exist. She said: ""It was out of control. Every day I was paying in Â£20, Â£40 or Â£100 to make up the shortfall. ""It was just money going into a black hole. ""Customers would come in the next day and say, is that you having problems again with the Post Office because I saw the light on last night. ""We thought, we'll sort it, we'll get there, but it was fighting a losing battle."" Of the hundreds of former sub-postmasters accused of fraud, only 72 have had their names cleared so far Another witness, Vinod Sharma, paid Â£28,000 after a Post Office audit at his newsagents in Balornock, Glasgow. Mr Sharma, who became a sub-postmaster in 1977, said: ""You wake up the middle of the night and think, God, what's happened? What are we going to do - what can we do? ""You soldier on but you do suffer a lot."" Around the year 2000, the Post Office installed a whole load of new software, from tiny branches to big offices right across the UK. Everyone had their system upgraded from the big book ledgers that were used in many places up until that point. What sub-postmasters and the Post Office didn't know at the stage when the system went live was that there were bugs, errors and glitches within it. Gradually, the Post Office realised that money looked like it was going missing from a number of offices. Rather than believe the sub-postmasters, who were saying the money was still physically there in the post office and just looked like it was missing from the system, the Post Office decided to believe the software and use it as evidence in court. A number of whistle-blowers have come forward and said: ""Yes, at different stages we were told there were bugs and errors in the IT process."" So this public inquiry is trying to find out who was responsible, who knew and why those convictions carried on happening - even when the Post Office, and indeed the government, eventually knew what was going on behind the scenes. Although 72 former sub-postmasters in the UK have had their names cleared so far, many are yet to receive compensation. In 2007, Mary Philp was suspended by the Post Office over allegations of missing funds at her sub-post office branch in Auchtermuchty, Fife. She died in 2018, at the age of 83, before the first court case was won by the sub-postmasters. Former sub-postmistress Mary Philp died in 2018, at the age of 83, before the first court case was won Her daughter Myra, who worked with her mother at the Auchtermuchty branch in 2001, said she was a proud and honest woman and the accusations had a devastating impact on her. Myra said: ""It totally destroyed her, to be accused of something she wasn't doing. ""My mum tried everything to point out there was some kind of error. Not to be believed, and to be treated that way, meant she lost her confidence. ""She didn't work again and any time anyone mentioned it to her, she would well up and cry. ""Somebody should be made to stand up and pay for it. ""Not just financially. They need to take responsibility and they need to take it more quickly."" Further inquiry witnesses will include Keith Macaldowie, who ran a post office in Greenock until he was forced to resign in 2011. An audit had uncovered a Â£10,000 shortfall which was later found to be caused by problems with the Post Office's Horizon IT system. Mr Macaldowie told BBC Scotland the ""massive injustice"" had life-changing effects on his mental health. He said: ""This is actually the first time I've talked about it in the 11 years since it happened - I tried to keep it quiet. ""But I have social anxieties through it, I have depression through it and I'm on medication. ""The justice system is innocent until proven guilty, but according to the Post Office it's guilty until proved innocent. ""And you couldn't prove yourself innocent because you couldn't get your hands on any of the evidence to then go through it.""

Tui warns no last minute deals as bookings surge,"Holiday giant Tui has said it expects summer bookings to ""almost reach"" 2019 levels this year, but warned there will be ""no last minute"" low price deals. The company said bookings had surged in the past six weeks as people planned for summer breaks after the easing of Covid travel restrictions. But it warned the impact of Covid and the Ukraine war on customer behaviour remained ""difficult to predict"". Tui's boss warned of price rises and limited offers due to high fuel costs. ""There will be practically no last minute offers at low prices this summer,"" said Fritz Joussen. Tui's losses halved to â¬614.5m (Â£525m) in the six months to March, as it hailed a strong recovery in customer demand. How are travel rules being relaxed? Holiday bookings jump as Covid travel tests axed As a result, the company told its shareholders it could return to profit by the end of the year. ""The high demand for travel and the very good business performance confirm our forecasts,"" said Mr Joussen. ""2022 will be a good financial year. Capacity almost reaches pre-corona level of 2019."" He added: ""After two years of crisis, we expect Tui to become profitable again in the current financial year... This is the basis for new growth."" Tui told the BBC Greece was its most popular destination currently, closely followed by the Canary and Balearic Islands and Turkey. In the past three months, 1.9 million customers flew with Tui which was an increase of 1.7 million compared to the same period in 2021 when global travel was on its knees due to the pandemic. The firm said bookings for summer holidays were currently at 85% of 2019 levels, with reservations from UK customers up 11% on two years ago. With Covid travel restrictions receding, demand for overseas summer holidays is coming back with a bang. And for Tui, UK holidaymakers are leading the way back to the beach. The tour operator says people are spending more on summer trips, for example going for longer and taking more package tours. The optimism isn't completely un-clouded. Tui -  like other travel businesses  - will be keeping an eye on how the Ukraine war, inflation and any future travel restrictions affect consumers' behaviour. Many airports and some airlines had a tricky Easter holiday period. Some simply didn't have enough staff to cope with the sudden surge in demand. But this is another sign that lots of people still want to go away, and they are getting booking. In fact, people trying to book summer trips or hotels at the last minute might find their options limited as lots of other people have got there first. The phasing out of UK testing rules in February has resulted in growing demand for flights and holidays. However, some countries still expect travellers to follow isolation and testing requirements. On Tuesday, Heathrow Airport said it had seen strong demand in April and forecast that passenger numbers will grow this summer. However, the UK's biggest airport said demand would only hit 65% of pre-pandemic levels overall for the year as rising prices force customers to cut back. The Bank of England expects inflation - the rate at which prices rise - to breach 10% later this year, putting the UK at risk of recession. ""The ongoing war in Ukraine, higher fuel costs, continuing travel restrictions for key markets like the United States and the potential for a further variant of concern creates uncertainty going forward,"" the airport said.

Energy firm windfall tax has not been ruled out,"A windfall tax on big oil and gas companies to help tackle the soaring cost of living has not been ruled out, sources close to the chancellor say. Officials say Rishi Sunak is still open to the idea if firms do not reinvest their bumper profits in the UK. Current policy is still based on the tax deterring investment in new oil and gas fields and green technologies. Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned last week it could put future UK energy security at risk. However, the Treasury is now pointing to comments Rishi Sunak made in an interview with Mumsnet in April in which he said ""nothing's ever off the table in these things"". The chancellor warned that if sufficient investment was not forthcoming ""then of course that [windfall tax] is something I would look at"". The fact that Treasury officials are using the chancellor's comments in April as the primary text in the study of windfall tax probability is further evidence of the ""leeway"" they have on the policy, one official said today. The question remains how much investment would be enough to make the chancellor put the windfall tax stick away? The chancellor and business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng have previously welcomed pledges by BP to invest Â£18bn in the UK by the end of 2030 and Shell to invest Â£20-25bn in the next 10 years. However, neither of their commitments has materially increased as their profits have ballooned. Shell made a record Â£7bnin the first three months of this yearwhile BP reported a decade high Â£5bn. BP boss Bernard Looney, who famously described the company as a ""cash machine"", told journalists that it would proceed with all of their UK investments with or without a windfall tax. Shell boss Ben van Beurden wouldn't be drawn on whether it would scale back investment but did say Shell's programme of investments would be helped by ""a stable tax and regulatory environment"". Windfall taxes are not something in this chancellor's economic DNA. Oil and gas prices are extremely volatile and when BP and Shell were making record losses when oil prices collapsed, there was no clamour to help them out. The boss of Centrica, Chris O'Shea has likened a windfall tax to ""burning the furniture to keep warm"" - a quick fix but a poor long-term decision. But the chronic squeeze on household incomes has seen some perhaps unexpected advocates for a windfall tax. On Tuesday, Tesco chairman John Allan told the BBC that the case for one was overwhelming in the face of the genuine hardship he was seeing reflected in stores. An oil and gas industry executive conceded ""it's clear this debate is not going away. I don't think the chancellor wants to do it but the political pressure is clearly there"" The evolution of a policy U-turn starts with a few mutations, some of which are shut down and others allowed to persist as it slowly takes a new shape. We are not there yet - but to mix metaphors further, officials seem to be ""rolling the pitch"" before potentially delivering a change. One of the biggest problems may be designing the mechanism to impose the tax. BP and Shell have paid almost zero tax on their North Sea operations over the last few years as prices have been much lower and they are allowed to offset the cost of decommissioning old North Sea facilities against any profits made. Taxing worldwide income would mean taxing BP and Shell on profits made in places like the US, activities they will have paid US tax on already. While big global players like BP and Shell could take such a tax in their stride, UK waters are also home to smaller firms who may be deterred from investing by the prospect of a tax raid. Creating a minimum revenue threshold - as the government did with its digital services tax - could exempt them while hitting the deep pockets of the likes of BP and Shell. The other question is whether it is purely retrospective - and if so, how far back in history do you go. The shareholders of the company now may not be the same as the ones that enjoyed the windfall, so there's a risk in going back too far. However, tax experts say that if you made it purely retrospective, then you could argue it is no disincentive to future investment as long as it comes with a credible promise it's a one-off occurrence. It's likely that these are the exact conversations going on inside the Treasury right now.

"Ministers pledge votes on neighbours' extensionsMichael Gove proposes fresh planning rules, but leaves a question mark over his party's new homes target.UK PoliticsComments","This video can not be played Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove casts doubt on 300,000 homes target Neighbours could be allowed to vote on whether planning permission should be given for developments - such as house extensions - on their street. The ""street votes"" would be an alternative to traditional forms of planning permission. It comes as Michael Gove ditched most of the government's reforms of the planning system in England. Downing Street insisted it was still committed to building 300,000 homes a year by the mid-2020s. Mr Gove earlier told BBC Radio 4's Today programme more homes were needed. But, he added, hitting a ""statistical target"" was not the only measure of success, particularly ""if the homes that are built are shoddy, in the wrong place, don't have the infrastructure required, and are not contributing to beautiful communities"". Is the government meeting its new-homes target? The 300,000 target was a key Conservative pledge at the 2019 general election. Mr Gove's predecessor as Communities Secretary, Robert Jenrick, aimed to meet it by forcing councils to accept new housing developments in designated areas. But the plans sparked a significant Tory backlash,including from former Prime Minister Theresa May, who called them ""ill-conceived"". Some in the party said the policy had contributed to by-election losses in former Conservative heartlands - includingChesham and Amersham- fears that would only have been exacerbated bylast week's local elections results. Now Mr Jenrick's proposals will be dropped in favour of a new Levelling Up and Regeneration Bill,published on Wednesday,external. Other new policies will include: Design codes to let local communities set rules about the layout of new developments and materials which could be used A new infrastructure levy - to be determined locally - to increase funds for projects such as schools, hospitals and roads, by basing the sum on the value of the property when it is sold, rather than when it gets planning permission Digitising the planning system, making plans more accessible online rather than relying on notices on lampposts Labour's shadow levelling up secretary Lisa Nandy said: ""Under the Conservatives housing has become less affordable, spending on rent has sky-rocketed, and homeownership has gone down."" She said the party could ""no longer claim to be the party of homeownership"". Planning reforms paused amid Tory MP anger Why do ministers face a backlash on planning rules? Archaeologists dig in over planning reforms row Michael Gove was confronted by fury inside his own party over planning reforms put forward by his predecessor. So he's junked them. Instead, there's a set of measures designed to give people more say over development in their areas. Mr Gove has suggested communities will be more open to new housing if it's not imposed on them - if it's ""beautiful"" and ""democratic"". But having ditched more radical reforms, the government may well struggle to meet its own target for building new homes. All the while, there are tens of thousands of people on housing waiting lists, families living in unsuitable or temporary accommodation, and many others unable to afford to get on the property ladder. There are other measures in the Queen's Speech designed to improve the housing market - giving renters more protection and suggestions of a clampdown on empty second homes. It's a complex problem of which the planning system is only one part. But the reality is that the country is facing a housing crisis, and so far successive governments have failed to find a solution. In Boris Johnson's first year in office, only 243,000 new homes were supplied,according to the House of Commons Library,external- falling to 216,000 in 2020/21, partly because of the disruption caused by the pandemic. Research conducted by the BBC in 2020found the difference between the housing stock in England and the number of homes needed was more than one million. Robert Jenrick told MPs the government was likely to continue missing its target by a ""country mile"" without more action. The Conservatives pledged to build 300,000 homes a year in England by the mid-2020s as part of its 2019 manifesto Mr Gove said communities had been ""understandably resistant"" to new developments when factors like the appearance of the buildings and the supporting infrastructure - like GP surgeries and schools - were not included in the plans. But he believed more people would be in favour of new housing under his proposals, adding: ""It shouldn't be a case that we impose. It is important that even as we seek to improve housing supply, we also seek to build communities that people love and are proud of."" Labour MP Clive Betts - who chairs the housing select committee - called the ""street vote"" plan a gimmick, telling the BBC it was not possible for communities to ""decide absolutely everything"" about urban planning in their area. He told the BBC the process of building new housing should be simplified, with local people involved in decisions about where homes might be placed much earlier than at the planning permission stage. Before proposals can be put to a local vote, they will be examined against a set of nationally prescribed development rules, which are to be agreed in due course, the government said. Development will go ahead only if the proposal is endorsed by a ""supermajority"" of residents in a referendum. The precise thresholds for approval would be set out in regulations in due course, the government added. Around 340,000 new homes are needed in England each year - 145,000 of them should be affordable, research for the National Housing Federation in 2019 said In 2020, the Affordable Housing Commission found that more than half of 18 to 24 year-olds still lived with family members; 18% continuing to do so when aged 25 to 34 From 2010 to 2020, more than 464,000 affordable homes were built; 114,000 of these were social homes (housing provided for people on low incomes or with particular needs) In England, an average house cost Â£292,000 (March 2022, ONS) The latest official figure for median monthly rent (for 2021) was Â£755, the highest ever recorded Are you struggling to get on the housing ladder?

UK rejects EU plans to deal with NI Protocol,"Liz Truss says the EU's proposals, released last October, could lead to ""everyday items disappearing from shelves"" The UK has rejected EU plans aimed at reducing the impact of the post-Brexit treaty for Northern Ireland, saying they would make things worse. The EU claims the proposals would reduce paperwork and checks on goods entering NI from Great Britain. But the government says they would ""worsen the current trading arrangements"". The UK verdict is part of an escalating dispute which could soon see the government scrapping parts of the deal. The protocol is an issue under fresh scrutiny following elections to the Northern Ireland Assembly. The elections cemented a majority for assembly members who accept the protocol, including the new largest party, the republican party Sinn FÃ©in. But the second largest party, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), said it would not nominate ministers to form a new executive in Northern Ireland until its concerns with the protocol were resolved. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said, in a statement released on Tuesday night, that her preference had always been for a ""negotiated solution"" but that she would not shy away from ""taking action to stabilise the situation in Northern Ireland if solutions cannot be found"". What is the Northern Ireland Protocol? A source close to Ms Truss said she believed the current situation could not ""drag on"", with the foreign secretary now eyeing domestic legislation to start scrapping parts of the treaty. The post-Brexit arrangement for Northern Ireland, known as the Protocol, isa special Brexit deal for Northern Irelanddesigned to prevent the return of a hard land border with the Republic of Ireland. It was agreed between the UK and the EU in 2019, put into domestic law by the UK Parliament and came into force in January 2021. It works by keeping Northern Ireland inside the EU's single market for goods. This means Northern Ireland continues to follow some EU laws and there are new checks and paperwork for goods which are imported into Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK. The EU acknowledges that it has caused difficulties for Northern Ireland businesses and its October proposals were an attempt to ease that burden. Under the protocol, checks are required on goods coming into Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK At the time, its chief negotiator, MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ, said it was a ""robust package of creative, practical solutions"". Much of that package concernedfood products which are subject to the greatest level of new checks. The EU said it would mean inspections of food products would be reduced far below what is usually required at single-market borders. However, the plan came with caveats and the UK said the EU needed to do more. But this government statement amounts to a public rejection of what the EU was proposing. It focuses on the fact that grace periods mean the protocol is not being fully implemented. It says if the grace periods were replaced with the EU proposals, the checks and controls would increase, and these plans would lead to ""everyday items disappearing off the shelves"". It claims a range of food would likely be unavailable in Northern Ireland shops if it originates from outside the EU, such as Thai green curry ready meals, New Zealand Lamb and Brazilian pork. It also claims ""sending a parcel to Northern Ireland would require more than 50 fields of information for the customs declaration for one parcel"". Earlier, Mr Å efÄoviÄ said that solutions could be found without changing the protocol, and the EU said it was ""bending over backwards"" to find solutions. Maros Sefcovic says solutions offered in October are ""robust and creative"" He pointed to how the EU had changed its laws to ensure medicines could be traded freely from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. He added that with ""political will and genuine commitment joint solutions to legitimate practical issuesâ¦ can be found within the framework of the protocol"". He warned that the protocol, as a cornerstone of the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement, was an international agreement and ""it's renegotiation is not an option"". Whitehall sources have suggested that, within government, Ms Truss' position is relatively hard-line. Former PM Theresa May said it was ""not the right move"" for the government to take unilateral action involving the protocol. Previously the UK has threatened to trigger what's known as Article 16. That is the provision within the protocol that could potentially see parts of the agreement suspended if the treaty is causing ""serious economic, societal or environmental difficulties"". A source close to the foreign secretary insisted that her ""absolute priority"" was protecting peace in Northern Ireland. ""We can't have the current situation drag on. That is why she's prepared to act if solutions can't be found with the EU, who still aren't prepared to show the requisite flexibility despite the seriousness of the issue,"" they said. The protocol is opposed by unionists, who argue it undermines Northern Ireland's place in the UK The UK has demanded fundamental changes to the treaty. It wants to remove checks entirely on goods destined to stay in Northern Ireland as well as overhaul VAT and governance arrangements. There is scepticism in Brussels about whether the UK will really push ahead with ditching parts of the protocol. ""From all her meetings with the EU and member states she knows exactly that this is a no-go for all of them,"" said one EU diplomat. ""So this can only be about catering to a domestic audience."" Another senior diplomat warned that such a move by the UK would only serve to ""delight"" Russian President Vladimir Putin. ""Contemplating to break international law and undermining Western unity at a time when Western democracies have come together to defend international law against Russia would be an utterly irresponsible move,"" they said. On Monday, Mrs May questioned in Parliament what the move to unilaterally scrap parts of the protocol would say about the UK's ""willingness to abide by treaties which it has signed"". And in a rebuke to Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, who said the protocol was harming the Good Friday Agreement, Mrs May added: ""I put a deal before this house which actually met the requirements of the Good Friday Agreement and actually enabled us not to have a border down the Irish Sea or to have a border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. ""Sadly, the DUP, and others across this house, chose to reject that, but it was just such an opportunity."" Mrs May, who stepped down in 2019, had proposed an insurance arrangement designed to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. It would have kept the UK in a ""single customs territory"" with the EU, and left Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods. British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss and European Commissioner in charge of Brexit negotiations MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ On Tuesday, the European Commission said it wanted to find practical solutions within the boundaries of the treaty, reiterating that its proposals weren't ""take it or leave it."" However a spokesman insisted there would be no renegotiation. Whitehall sources have indicated that there are divisions within the UK cabinet about unilateral moves to start scrapping parts of the protocol, with concerns it could spark a ""trade war."" Chancellor Rishi Sunak is understood to have given an ""assessment"" on the economic implications - a Downing Street source said that the government would act ""responsibly"" on the issue. The plan to legislate has also been described as just ""an option"" in Whitehall that is yet to formally reach cabinet. Ms Truss was expected to speak with her EU counterpart Mr Å efÄoviÄ in the coming days. Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) MÃ­cheÃ¡l Martin said he had a ""frank and honest"" exchange of views in his telephone call with Prime Minister Boris Johnson earlier on Tuesday about the blockages in restoring an executive. He said what was needed was a proper ""intensification"" of discussions between London and Brussels regarding the implementation of the protocol. The taoiseach said he set out in clear terms his ""serious concerns"" about any unilateral move by London. ""I shared my view that this would be the wrong approach.  It would be destabilising in Northern Ireland and would further erode trust,"" he said. GOVERNMENT CRISIS:What happens next?

Sarin gas blamed for Gulf War syndrome,"US scientists say they have discovered what caused thousands of soldiers who served in the 1991 Gulf War to fall sick with mysterious symptoms. They have pinned the blame on the nerve agent sarin, which was released into the air when caches of Iraqi chemical weapons were bombed. Many veterans have complained of a range of debilitating symptoms which developed after their service. But for decades the cause of Gulf War Syndrome has remained elusive. Gulf War syndrome 'not caused by depleted uranium' Why hasn't the mystery of Gulf War Syndrome been solved? Sarin is usually deadly, but lead researcher Dr Robert Haley said the gas that soldiers were exposed to in Iraq was diluted, and so not fatal. ""But it was enough to make people ill if they were genetically predisposed to illness from it."" Dr Haley said the key to whether somebody fell ill was a gene known as PON1, which plays an important role in breaking down toxic chemicals in the body. His team found veterans with a less effective version of the PON1 gene were more likely to become sick. Thelatest study,external- largely funded by the US government - involved more than 1,000 randomly-selected American Gulf War veterans. Dr Haley, of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, said: ""This is the most definitive study. ""We believe it will stand up to any criticism. And we hope our findings will lead to treatment that will relieve some of the symptoms."" More than 50,000 British troops served in the war which followed Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait. The Royal British Legion said research suggests up to 33,000 UK Gulf War veterans could be living with the syndrome, with 1,300 claiming a war pension for conditions connected to their service in the Gulf. Kerry Fuller pictured during the Gulf War Over the past three decades, the veterans say they have struggled to have their illness taken seriously. Before the war, Kerry Fuller from Dudley, West Midlands, was a fit 26-year old who loved climbing and went to the gym several times a week. Now it's a daily battle simply to get out of bed. At the age of 40, he had a stroke. Now 58, he says he has such excruciating muscle and joint pain that he screams so loudly when he moves in the night that he wakes his whole household. He suffers from problems with his balance, memory and speech. ""Even when I was still in the military, I was getting illness after illness, breathing problems, chronic fatigue,"" he said. ""And when I questioned whether it could be anything to do with my service in the Gulf or what we were exposed to, the military line was 'You're talking nonsense, there's no evidence. Two paracetamol. Crack on'."" The National Gulf Veterans and Families Association, a charity working with British ex-soldiers who are ill, welcomed the study. ""For 30 years they have been disowned, ignored and lied to by consecutive governments, with no positive answers to their questions about exposure to toxic substances and gases and the affect it had on them both physically and mentally,"" it said in a statement. ""We hope the UK government takes this report on board and will respond by offering Gulf veterans access/opportunity to have the tests. ""This will hopefully lead to more meaningful and proper medical treatment which they have for too long been denied."" The Ministry of Defence said: ""We continue to monitor and welcome any new research that is published around the world and financial support is available to veterans whose illness is due to service through the MoD War Pensions and the Armed Forces occupational pension schemes."" But the Royal British Legion said there had been ""little meaningful research"" on Gulf War Syndrome in the UK. Professor Randall Parrish, of the University of Portsmouth, published a study last year which ruled out depleted uranium as a cause. He said: ""I think this is a great example of an issue that has required a long-term effort to solve, but which only a few scientists have persisted in - others giving up and assuming it is either not a real illness or too complex to solve, and funding agencies not wanting to wade too deeply in the politics of it.""

"Tesco Mobile ads offensive, watchdog rules","Tesco apologised, saying the ads were intended to reflect customer frustration with bill increases An advertising campaign for Tesco Mobile which used the names of foods as substitutes for expletives has been banned. The newspaper ads, Twitter posts and outdoor posters used words like ""shiitake"" and ""pistachio"" instead of swear words. The Advertising Standards Authority said they were likely to cause ""serious and widespread offence"". Tesco apologised and said it was trying to portray customer frustration. One advert, a sponsored Twitter post seen in February, featured an animation with text saying: ""What a load of shiitake"". An image of a mushroom covering the last three letters was seen to roll away. A line underneath said that big mobile networks were raising customers' bills. Newspaper adverts criticised competitors' price increases with the message: ""They're taking the pistachio."" And a digital outdoor poster showed an animation with the slogan: ""For fettucine's sake."" Three images of pasta covered all but the letter F in ""fettucine"" before rolling away to reveal the slogan in full. The ASA said it had received 52 complaints that the ads were offensive because they alluded to swear words, with some people objecting that they were displayed in places where they could be seen by children. The adverts used foodstuffs to suggest Tesco Mobile provides ""supermarket value"" for mobile phones Tesco Mobile initially defended its advertising on the grounds that they had not used any offensive words or imagery. But the ASA said the words they were alluding to were ""so likely to offend that they should not generally be used or alluded to in advertising, regardless of whether they were used in a tongue-in-cheek manner"". In the case of the fettucine ad, the ASA said the word ""fettucine"" was not closely linked to the expletive, but that when all but the first letter was concealed in the animation, readers would understand it as alluding to the swear word. The advertising watchdog said it was likely that parents would want their children to avoid these expletives or obvious allusions to them, and ruled that the ads must not appear again. A Tesco Mobile spokeswoman said: ""We're really sorry for any offence caused. We know the frustration that consumers face when they notice their mobile phone bill has gone up mid-contract and we were reflecting their frustration - and ours - in these ads. ""We're proud to offer our mobile customers supermarket value, and so we used a play on words relating to food products.""

Shanghai moves to impose tightest restrictions yet,"Shanghai is now in its seventh week of city wide restrictions Shanghai officials will over the next few days further restrict access to food and hospitals in some parts of the city, the most severe phase of its extended lockdown yet. Commercial food deliveries are not allowed and access to hospitals for all but emergencies must first be approved. Neighbours of Covid-19 cases and others living close by are also being forced into government quarantine facilities. Shanghai is now in its seventh week of city-wide restrictions. Confirmed cases have fallen significantly from their peak, but authorities have not yet been able to hit the target of what they call ""societal zero"", where no cases are reported outside of quarantine facilities. Despite the tougher measures, Shanghai officials insist that people living in half the city's districts are now free to leave their homes and walk around. State media has shown propaganda videos of departing medical workers visiting city landmarks together and taking photographs. Photos of medical workers visiting city landmarks together have emerged Official notices from local committees of the ruling Communist Party, seen by the BBC, detail several restrictions imposed under what officials call ""silent periods"" for the next three days. These include only permitting government food deliveries, not allowing residents to ""step out"" of their front doors and requiring approval from the committee for anyone other than emergency cases to access hospitals. The BBC is already aware of some cases where residents have had difficulties in getting emergency ambulances to come quickly, with some patients forced to use private cars to get to a hospital. Authorities have also stepped up measures aimed at people who live close to positive cases, even if these close contacts test negative. They are now sweeping up large groups of people in apartment buildings who live on the same floor or even just in the same building as those who've tested positive. Footage has also emerged on social media showing extreme disinfection taking place inside homes where people have been removed after testing positive. Widespread use of industrial scale disinfection has been a key tactic used by authorities. State censors have moved quickly to remove questions about the legality of the disinfection and also of the moving large numbers of people from their homes, despite testing negative. In some cases, people who have been removed from their homes and taken into central quarantine have been told to leave a key to their home, usually in the door, so officials can come in and disinfect the space. Some legal figures have questioned if this move is ""constitutional"". The hard life of a homeless Shanghai deliveryman China's elderly suffer in Covid quarantine centres Why Shanghai has changed its approach to Covid How Chinaâs lockdowns could hit UK prices A constitutional law professor based in Shanghai had earlier posted an open letter online stating that forcing residents into quarantine centres required State Council approval or new laws passed by the legislature. His post was quickly taken down. As concern over food supplies grow, city officials said they would remove anyone living in temporary accommodation on the streets or in vacant buildings, placing them into ""closed loop management"" -  which means that employees have to live as well as work at their offices or factories. This measure is likely to target app-based delivery drivers who are vital for maintaining the supply chain to almost 25 million people living here. Many of these drivers currently live in temporary accommodation as they fear being locked down somewhere permanent and therefore being unable to do their job. The tightened measures come just days after China's president Xi Jinping re-iterated his commitment to the controversial ""zero-Covid"" strategy. In a paper published in the health journal The Lancet earlier this week, senior Chinese health officials said the lockdown would ""buy time to vaccinate more people"". Their comments come after the head of the World Health Organisation called China's zero-Covid strategy unsustainable. ""When we talk about zero-Covid, we don't think that it's sustainable, considering the behaviour of the virus now and what we anticipate in the future,"" Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Tuesday at a news conference. The clip was widely shared on Chinese social media before being blocked by censors. More than two years after Covid-19 first emerged here officials figures show around 90% of the population nationwide has been vaccinated. But only 38% of the more vulnerable - those over 60 - in Shanghai have the full protection of three vaccinations.

Are Finland and Sweden going from neutral to Nato?,"Both Sweden and Finland have increased their military budget in recent years Sweden is now set to join neighbouring Finland as a new Nato member, after Turkey's president withdrew a series of objections. Finland officially joined the Western defensive alliance in April, bringing the number of member states to 31. The two Nordic states have long maintained military neutrality, but that changed in February 2022 when Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine - the biggest war on the European continent since World War Two. It was Magdalena Andersson of Sweden and Finland's Sanna Marin who kick-started the countries' bids to join Nato in 2022 Vladimir Putin's full-scale invasion shattered a long-standing sense of stability in northern Europe, leaving Sweden and Finland feeling vulnerable. Finnish ex-Prime Minister Alexander Stubb said joining the alliance was a ""done deal"" for his country as soon as Russian troops invaded Ukraine last year. For many Finns, the war brought a haunting sense of familiarity. It was in late 1939 that the Soviets invaded Finland. For more than three months the Finnish army put up fierce resistance, despite being heavily outnumbered. Finland held out until March 1940 but lost its eastern province of Karelia to Russia. They avoided occupation, but ended up losing 10% of their territory. Watching the war in Ukraine unfold was like reliving this history, said Iro Sarkka, a political scientist at the University of Helsinki. Finns were looking at their 1,340km (830 mile) border with Russia, she said, and thinking: ""Could this happen to us?"" Finland held out until March 1940 but lost its eastern province of Karelia to Russia Sweden has also felt endangered in recent years. Sweden's military weakness came into full view in 2013 when Russian bomber planes were able to simulate an attack on Stockholm and Sweden needed Nato help to ward them off. In 2014, Swedes were transfixed by reports that a Russian submarine was lurking in the shallow waters of the Stockholm archipelago. In 2018, every household received army pamphlets titled ""if crisis or war comes"" - the first time they were sent out since 1991. For a population of only 5.5 million, Finland's conscript military is highly trained and potentially large. It trains at least 21,000 conscripts every year and has a reserve force of 900,000, soits wartime strength is estimated at 280,000,external. Sweden's military capacity is far smaller at 57,000. But it brought back conscription at the start of 2018, after suspending it in 2010, and the current number of up to 6,000 conscripts will rise to 8,000 in 2025. From the 1990s Sweden cut back the size of its military and changed its priorities from territorial defence to peacekeeping missions around the world. But that went into reverse with Russia's invasion of Crimea in 2014 and its increasing threat in the Baltic region. In some ways, not much. Sweden and Finland became official partners of Nato in 1994 and have since become major contributors to the alliance. They have taken part in several Nato missions since the end of the Cold War. The two countries will for the first time have security guarantees from nuclear states under Nato's Article 5, which views an attack on one member state as an attack on all. Historian Henrik Meinander said Finns were mentally prepared for membership, following a succession of small steps towards Nato since the fall of the Soviet Union. In 1992, Helsinki bought 64 US combat planes. Three years later, it joined the European Union, alongside Sweden, and every Finnish government since then has reviewed the so-called Nato option. Finland has already reached Nato's agreed defence spending target of 2% of GDP, and Sweden has drawn up plans to do so by 2026. Sweden may have been neutral during the Cold War but at the time it kept a force of at least 15,000 soldiers on the Baltic island of Gotland and has recently rebuilt its presence there. It hopes to build up its full-time military as well as its conscript force in the coming years. Is Nato's Nordic expansion a threat or boost to Europe? Russian President Vladimir Putin believes Nato expansion is a direct threat to his country's security - and claimed it was the reason he launched the 2022 war in Ukraine. But his invasion had the opposite effect by only serving to extend Nato's reach. Finland's accession was a particular setback, further extending Nato's influence over the Baltic Sea. And it brought a warning from the Kremlin of unspecified ""military-technical"" measures in retaliation. Russia's foreign ministry said both Sweden and Finland had been warned of the consequences if they did choose to join. Now that Sweden has been given the green light by Turkey to become a member, the Kremlin has said it will respond with the same kind of measures it proposed for Finland. What those measures would be is still vague. Russia says it has moved tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus, and they could reach Finland and Sweden. But former Finnish PM Alexander Stubb has warned that Russian cyber attacks, disinformation campaigns and occasional airspace violations are more likely. Under Article Five, Finland has - and Sweden will - soon have the commitment of the entire alliance to come to their aid if they come under attack. Their membership also makes defending the Nordic and Baltic region far more comprehensive. But there is a significant minority, at least in Sweden, who believe membership will have an adverse effect. Deborah Solomon, from the Swedish Peace and Arbitration Society, argued that Nato's nuclear deterrence increased tensions and risked an arms race with Russia. This complicated peace efforts, she said, and made Sweden a less safe place. Another fear is that in joining the alliance, Sweden would lose its leading role in global nuclear disarmament efforts. Many of Sweden's Nato-sceptics look back to the period between the 1960s and '80s, when Sweden used its neutrality to position itself as an international mediator. Joining Nato would be abandoning that dream, Ms Solomon said. Finland's neutrality was very different. It came about as a condition of peace imposed by the Soviet Union in a 1948 ""friendship agreement"". It was seen as a pragmatic way of surviving and maintaining the country's independence. If Sweden's neutrality was a matter of identity and ideology, in Finland it was a question of existence, said Henrik Meinander. Part of the reason Sweden could even afford to have a debate about Nato membership was because it used Finland and the Baltics as a ""buffer zone"", he said. Finland abandoned its neutrality after the Soviet Union collapsed. It looked to the West and sought to free itself from the Soviet sphere of influence. Turkey, and to a lesser extent Hungary, initially resisted both applications. Ankara accused the Nordic nations of supporting what it called terrorist organisations, including the Kurdish militant PKK and the Gulen movement, which Turkey blames for an attempted coup in 2016. Kurds make up 15-20% of Turkey's population, and have been persecuted by Turkish authorities for generations. But it was Sweden that triggered most hostility as Kurds have mobilised successfully in politics there over the decades. President Erdogan asked how ""how a country with terrorists on the streets... can contribute to Nato"". His main demand was to end political, financial and ""arms support"" to militants. Sweden updated its terror laws in June 2023 to outlaw taking part in an extremist group in a way that supported it - and weeks later a Kurdish man was jailed for attempting to finance terrorism. But there was some suggestion, denied by Turkey, that its main reason for resisting Sweden's bid was that Ankara was waiting for the US to provide F-16 fighter jets.

Businesses tell NI politicians to get back to work,"Business leaders are concerned about the impact on the economy of no stable government Business groups across Northern Ireland are calling on politicians to form an executive at Stormont this week. The first sitting of the assembly - in which Sinn FÃ©in is now the largest party - is due to take place on Friday. The DUP has refused to commit to electing a new assembly speaker due to concerns about the NI Protocol. New research has suggested Northern Ireland's economy slightly outperformed the UK average, partly due to the protocol. There will be no governing executive without the DUP's support as the second largest party. Northern Ireland's power-sharing system requires the largest unionist and nationalist parties to share first and deputy first minister posts. Ministers can run their respective departments without an executive, but no new decisions, such as agreeing a budget, can be taken. It comes as Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney is expected to meet the five main political parties in Belfast later. The Irish government has already joined with the British and US governments to urge the formation of an executive. The latest economic outlook from the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) said the Northern Ireland economy outperformed the UK average, and is now recovered to pre-pandemic levels. It said Northern Ireland's trading conditions with the European Union (EU) are an economic advantage. It said: ""Northern Irish output, as measured by Gross Value Added (GVA) has slightly outperformed the UK average. ""This is partly an outcome of the Northern Irish Protocol and its special status in the Brexit arrangements, including better trade and investment conditions as part of the EU's single market and customs union."" But critics of the protocol said its economic impact has been muted as it is not yet being fully implemented due to ""grace periods"". This video can not be played The Democratic Unionist Party says it will not join a power-sharing government without action on the protocol Belfast Chamber chief executive and former DUP minister Simon Hamilton says his message is clear: ""Get back to work"". ""Businesses were now hoping that they were going to move from coming out of the pandemic edging towards recovery, hoping for a period of stability. Now we've got the exact opposite, potentially, at Stormont,"" he said. ""We understand that there are difficulties with the protocol, we know that from our own membership that some businesses have struggled to deal with it, others have adapted much better. ""But no one is saying to us that they don't want to have an executive. ""What they should do is get back around the executive table."" Why is the DUP against the NI Protocol? Donaldson's Brexit trading dilemma Mr Hamilton said recent history had shown that not having a functioning executive for a protracted period is ""not good for Northern Ireland, it's not good for our economy and it's not good for society generally"". Under the protocol, checks are required on goods coming into Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK The DUP, which supported Brexit, has protested against the Northern Ireland Protocol, a part of the UK's deal with the EU which keeps Northern Ireland aligned with the EU's single market for goods. This was designed to ensure free trade across an open Irish border, but it has in turn created some new trade barriers for the movement of goods across the Irish Sea. In February, the partyremoved Paul Givan from his role as first ministerin protest against the protocol, triggering the collapse of the Northern Ireland Executive. They said the protocol had undermined Northern Ireland's position in the United Kingdom. In a recent survey of members of the Londonderry Chamber, 92% of north-west businesses said the lack of a functioning executive post-election would harm their business. President Aidan O'Kane said: ""We don't see it as being a choice between an executive or the protocol. We're asking for the executive to reform and start to support businesses. ""We would ask that the UK government and the EU start to work together to iron out the problems with the protocol - that shouldn't stop the formation of a government locally."" He said it was ""hugely frustrating"" for businesses and ""society as well"". This video can not be played Michelle O'Neill says the assembly election shows that the public want to see a new Northern Ireland Executive formed. The Federation of Small Businesses in Northern Ireland (FSBNI) has also raised concerns about the impact of not having an executive on the economic landscape. Head of FSBNI Roger Pollen said: ""With so much at stake, our priority is to see the formation of a stable executive which can take decisions that will provide stability for small businesses at a time of rising costs and deep uncertainty. ""It is only through effective collaboration that we will begin to see progress on many outstanding economic policies that will help protect jobs and boost prosperity right across Northern Ireland.""

We're closing our live coverage of the war in Ukraine for today in a little while. We'll leave you with a brief recap of what's happened: Fighting in the east  Beyond the Donbas region  In diplomacy  You can read about more of the day's key events here. Ukraine has said it is returning the bodies of fallen Russian troops back home. On Friday, military officials were seen loading and stacking bodies collected from the Kyiv and Chernihiv regions onto refrigerated rail cars. The move is in accordance with ""the norms of international humanitarian law"", according to Volodymyr Lyamzin, the head of Ukraine's civil-military cooperation. ""After the active phase of the conflict is over, sides have to return the bodies of the military of another country. Ukraine is ready to return the bodies to the aggressor,â Lyamzin told the Reuters news agency. Several refrigerated trains have reportedly been stationed in other parts of the country as well. Ukraine claims it has killed some 20,000 Russian troops. Russia has not updated its death toll since 25 March, when it acknowledged 1,351 deaths. TheBBC Ukrainian serviceis reporting that the Ukrainian army has released two decks of cards depicting Russians they suspect of war crimes. The idea replicates the set of55 playing cardsthat the US military produced in the 2003 invasion of Iraq, depicting what it said were the most wanted members of Saddam Hussein's government. Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Valerii Zaluzhnyi, said the cards were produced with the help of volunteers from the international intelligence community InformNapalm. US President Joe Biden has spoken with the leaders of Finland and Sweden about their plans to join the Nato alliance. The White House said Biden had held a joint phone call with Finnish President Sauli NiinistÃ¶ and Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson about the issue on Friday. A readout of the call claims the trio discussed Natoâs Open Door policy and ""the right of Finland and Sweden to decide their own future, foreign policy, and security arrangements"". Afterwards, NiinistÃ¶ wrote on Twitter that he ""went through Finland's next steps towards Nato membership"" on the call. It comes a day after NiinistÃ¶ and Finland's PM Sanna Marin called for the historically neutral country to apply for Nato membership ""without delay"". Sweden will announce its own decision on joining Nato on Sunday. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

As we reported on Thursday, a US lawmaker has single-handedly blocked a multi billion-dollar aid package to Ukraine from passing this week. President Joe Biden had called on Congress to send the bill - $39.8bn in economic, humanitarian and security assistance - to his desk by the end of the week, but Senator Rand Paul blocked an expedited vote on Thursday evening alleging that the government was ""shuffling money out the door as fast as they can"" with no oversight. ""My oath of office is to the US Constitution, not to any foreign nation,"" Paul said on the Senate floor defending his decision. ""We cannot save Ukraine by dooming the US economy."" The senator from Kentucky is calling for a watchdog provision in the bill to oversee how the money is being spent, an amendment that would require further delays in the bill's passage. Congressional leaders have chided the congressman for causing the delay, as the current bill has enough votes to pass in the Senate through regular order but this will now not happen until next week. Paul's defiance has been lauded in some corners, with former president Donald Trump's son arguing lawmakers in Washington - or ""the swamp"" as he called them - ""don't want transparency"".

Sweden and Finland have said that they will hold talks with the Turkish government after its president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, said he was not in favour of their plans to join Nato. The Swedish and Finnish foreign ministers, Ann Linde and Pekka Haavisto said they would speak to their Turkish counterpart, Mevlut Cavusoglu, about the issue at a Nato meeting on Saturday. Erdogan said that Nordic countries had given asylum to people Turkey considers to be Kurdish terrorists. He added that he did not want Nato to repeat what he called the mistake of the past when it allowed Greece to join. Responding to Turkey's comments, the US said Turkey ""is a valued Nato ally"" and ""they've been involved and helpful in trying to get a dialogue going here, between Russia and Ukraine"". John Kirby, press secretary for the US Ministry of Defence, added ""we're working to better clarify the [Turkey's] position here"". Law enforcement officers in Ukraine are investigating 41 Russian servicemen suspected of having committed war crimes in the country, Interfax-Ukraine news agency reports. Prosecutor-General Iryna Venediktova said the suspects will be investigated for a range of crimes - from the bombing of civilian infrastructure, killing of civilians, rape and looting. The suspects will answer before a Ukrainian court of law, she added. Today, a Russian soldier accused of killing an unarmed 62-year-old civilian appeared in court in Kyiv. Vadim Shishimarin, 21, was brought to court for a preliminary hearing. He faces possible life imprisonment on charges of war crimes and premeditated murder. During a televised address on Friday evening, Venediktova said preliminary hearings on two more suspects will be carried out next week. The leader of breakaway region South Ossetia has announced a referendum on whether to become a part of Russia. A statement from the office of Anatoly Bibilov said it was his people's ""historic aspiration"" to come together with Russia, and the vote would take place on 17 July. Moscow recognises the region as independent, after a brief war between Russia and Georgia in 2008, and has provided financial support, Russian citizenship for its citizens and sited military bases there. Georgia maintains that South Ossetia is an occupied territory and previously said that a referendum on joining Russia would be unacceptable. Negotiations with Russia over freeing the Ukrainian fighters under siege in the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol were ""very difficult"", Ukraine's deputy prime minister has said. In an online post, Iryna
Vereshchuk wrote: ""The result may not be to everyone's liking, but our task is
to evacuate our boys. All of them. ""Alive."" Yesterday, the Ukrainian government said that it was pushing for safe passage for 38 badly wounded fighters, in exchange for captured Russians. The Azovstal complex once sheltered hundreds of civilians and fighters, but after several weeks trapped underground civilians were freed in a series of humanitarian convoys last week and negotiations over the fighters began. The Russian air force has attacked an arms depot in the Kharkiv region in Ukraine, state news agency RIA reports. The news agency quoted the Russian defence ministry saying it had hit the facility on Friday. Meanwhile, eyewitnesses to an earlier attack in Kharkiv told news agency AFP that they had been targeted by a Russian tank as they tried to seek shelter at home. ""Four people died, two were injured. My daughter died from a shrapnel wound in the back of her head,"" Olga Karpenko, 52, said. The BBC has not been able to independently verify this information. Sergei Shoigu (pictured) spoke with his US counterpart for an hour More details have emerged of the telephone call between US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin and Russia's Defence Minister Sergei Shoygu, in which General Austin called for an immediate ceasefire. Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said that Gen Austin had stressed the importance of maintaining communication, after Moscow had appeared uninterested in speaking to the US on previous attempts to hold the conversation. An anonymous US official said the tone of the hour-long call was ""professional"", but did not resolve any specific issues or lead to changes in Russian policy, news agency Reuters report. Russia's defence ministry confirmed that the US had initiated the call, and discussed ""topical issues of international security... including the situation in Ukraine"". Olga IvshinaSenior correspondent, BBC News Russian Since the start of the war, our team has been following and verifying reports of losses among Russian troops fighting in Ukraine by following official announcements, local media reports as well as social media and speaking to the relatives of Russian servicemen. Up to this moment BBC News Russian has been able to verify the deaths of 2,336 Russian servicemen. We have been able to establish their names, ranks and military units where they served. This is nearly twice the latest official figure released by the Russian Defence Ministry in March. It is likely that the real figure of the Russian military in Ukraine is far higher than we have been able to establish. But our data analysis helps to see the trends of what is happening with the Russian army fighting in Ukraine. Nearly 20% of all confirmed military casualties are officers. This proportion has remained unchanged for the past three months. Experts say that Russian officers may have to risk more on the frontline because of persistent problems with communications. Over 25% of all losses are paratroopers and marines. These units are often used in reconnaissance and storming operations. However they often donât get enough operational support and evacuation opportunities for the wounded. Most of the casualties, confirmed by us, came from the least developed and economically deprived regions of Russia. There are only three confirmed deaths of servicemen from Moscow, even though the capital makes up almost 9% of the Russian population. Ukrainian authorities now say that nearly 27,000 Russian soldiers have been killed. Read the full story on the BBC's Russian service here. As we've been reporting, Ukraine's Defence Minister Oleksiy Reznikov has said the country is entering a new stage of the war. Reznikov pledged to arm a million fighters using the new weapons and military equipment the US and other Western countries have been donating to the country over the last couple of weeks. The defence minister said that during the beginning of the war, ""volunteers were extremely helpful"" and it's thanks to their mobility that they ""quickly resolved highly pressing issues"". Reznikov said that to win, Ukraine ""must plan resources carefully and avoid mistakes"" and was investing in Ukrainian production facilities to ""ensure the stability and frequency of deliveries"". In his statement on Facebook, he said that Ukraine had relied on charitable aid from citizens, volunteers, and civic organisations for a significant proportion of its military equipment. He said that at the end of April, Ukraine's ministry of defence was relying on donations for 50% of the bullet proof vests used in combat. But as of 13 May, Ukraine has managed to increase its production to provide 57% of the armed forces' bullet proof vests, he added. More now on the suspension of electricity exports from Russia to Finland, which followed rising tensions over Helsinki's announcement of its plan to join Nato. RAO Nordic, a subsidiary of the Russian company Inter RAO, said non-payment was behind its decision to halt electrity supplies. The company said they had not received funds since 6 May and described the situation as ""exceptional"", adding that it is the first time it's happened ""in over 20 years of our trading history"". It did not specify whether this was due to the impact of sanctions but added, ""we hope that the situation will get improved soon and the electricity trade with Russia could resume"". Meanwhlle, the Finnish grid operator Fingrid said it did not anticpate any problems with supply as a result of the suspension. It said it would make up the shortfall by generating more power domestically and increasing imports from Sweden. This video can not be played Scenes of devastation as 'Russian battalion destroyed' If you're just joining us, here's a little recap of the latest events in Ukraine to bring you up to speed. Russian bridge-building foiled  Beyond the Donbas region  In diplomacy Ukraine's defence minister has said he hopes to arm a million fighters as the country prepares for a ""new, long phase of war"". Oleksiy Reznikov noted in a Facebook post that Ukraine would ""need to meticulously plan resources"" and ""avoid mistakes"" in order to win the war. Already, he said, Russia had suffered a ""strategic defeat"". The arrival of foreign weapons and ""stimulating Ukrainian producers"" would help further tip the balance against Russia, he continued. But before that, Ukraine was ""facing extremely difficult weeks ahead"". ""Nobody can tell how many. In that period, we will hold the defence primarily with our own resources against the enemy mad with rage,"" he predicted, in comments translated by our colleagues at BBC Monitoring. ""Increasing pressure of sanctions against Russia and increasing foreign assistance to Ukraine should create, within several months, the conditions under which the Kremlin will finally lose all chances to achieve any success. Then a new window of opportunity will appear for Ukraine. In this extremely hard period, we need unity, cohesion, will and patience,"" he concluded. Electricity exports from Russia to Finland are being suspended from 01:00 local time (22:00 GMT) on Saturday. Finnish grid operator Fingrid said Russian utility Inter RAO was stopping supplies due to ""problems in receiving payments for electricity sold on the market"". The announcement comes the day after Finland signalled its intention to join Nato. Finland only buys 10% of its electricity from Russia, and according to Fingrid it will make up the shortfall by sourcing more power from Sweden, and increasing generation in Finland. Finland expects to become self-sufficient in electrical energy in 2023, the company added. Sophie WilliamsBBC News, Lviv Ukraine says it's thwarted Russian attempts to create a key bridging point A Ukrainian military analyst admits that constant attacks
from Moscow mean the Ukrainians are on the back foot around the Siversky Donets
river â even though theyâve managed to thwart Russian attempts to put down
bridges near Severodonetsk. âThe advantage is now on the side of the Russian Federation,â
Oleh Zhdanov tells the BBC. âWe still can't bring down Russia's offensive pace.â Zhdanov says itâs âvery importantâ that his
side keeps control of this part of the Siversky Donets. Gaining the area would allow the Russians to make a
bridgehead and advance in the direction of the riverâs estuary, Zhdanov explains.
This would let them encircle the key city of Severodonetsk more fully as they
attempt to cut off Ukraineâs whole eastern Donbas region. The order for soldiers to gain this territory came
from the very top, Zhdanov adds. âThey are advancing so hard because it is a
political task, because Putin has ordered it,â he says. As weâve been reporting today, UK
defence intelligence says a Russian battalion lost almost all its armoured
vehicles during failed attempts to establish bridges across the river. Russia
has not commented. Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoygu and his US counterpart Lloyd Austin have spoken for the first time since 18 February - before Russia invaded Ukraine. According to a statement issued by the Pentagon, Austin urged an immediate ceasefire in Ukraine and used the call to emphasise the importance of maintaining lines of communication. On Wednesday, Austin held talks with UK Defence Minister Ben Wallace. In a statement, Wallace said the two leaders pledged ""to continue to work with unity and resolve to provide
Ukraine with what it needs to defend itself against Russiaâs
unprovoked invasion"". Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Second night of property burnings in Sri Lanka,"Mobs have attacked buses as well as property belonging to the Rajapaksas and other politicians Security forces are deployed across Sri Lanka with orders to shoot looters on sight amid continuing protests at the government's handling of a devastating economic crisis. President Gotabaya Rajapaksa has vowed to restore order, in his first national speech since protests began last month. Ignoring calls to resign, he offered to cede some powers to parliament and name a prime minister, but set no timetable. His brother quit as PM on Monday amid fury over soaring prices and shortages. Sri Lankans are desperate as basic items like food and fuel run out or become unaffordable. ""We have come to the protest site despite the curfew,"" one protester, Chandrasekaran, told BBC Tamil in Colombo. ""We are suffering even now. There is no kerosene, no petrol, no diesel, and no power."" Despite a nationwide curfew, there have been two consecutive nights of arson attacks by mobs - many have targeted property belonging to the Rajapaksas and other politicians who are blamed for the mess the country is in. Shops near Colombo were torched, as well as a resort owned by the son of former Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa. Mr Rajapaksa, the president's elder brother and a two-time former president,Â is holed up in a naval base in the north-east for his own safety, the military has confirmed. This video can not be played ""I never wanted him"" - people from Sri Lanka's protests on the country's leaders At least nine people have been killed and about 200 injured in unrest since Monday.Â It began when government supporters attacked protesters who are demanding thatÂ Gotabaya RajapaksaÂ leave office. Opposition politicians have warned the violence could have been staged to give the army a pretext to take power. Rumours of a possible coup have been fuelled by the presence of large numbers of troops with armoured vehicles on the streets. But the military have denied any such move is planned. ""When there is a dangerous situation in the country, powers are given to the military to deal with it,"" Defence Secretary Kamal Gunaratne told a news conference. ""Don't ever think that we are trying to capture power. The military has no such intentions."" Sri Lanka had already seen weeks of protests over its dire financial situation, which has caused the Sri Lankan rupee to plunge, provoking severe shortages of basic items such as food, fuel and medical supplies. The worst trouble overnight was in the north of the capital, Colombo, where rival groups set fire to shops in the town of Negombo. On Monday night, mobs burned more than 50 houses belonging to politicians, while a controversial museum dedicated to the Rajapaksa family was also razed to the ground in their traditional heartland, Hambantota, in the country's south. Soldiers and police are under orders to shoot anyone damaging property or threatening life Shops, businesses and offices were shut for a third day on Wednesday under a nationwide curfew in place until Thursday morning. Another protester told the BBC the president's speech on Wednesday was long overdue. ""Where were you for the last 30 days? People don't have medicine, people don't have food, the entire country's at a standstill,"" Kavindya Thennakoon said. ""The reforms he's suggesting are not what we need. What we need right now is for [the president] to resign from office... It baffles my mind that Gotabaya Rajapaksa doesn't understand that."" The streets of the capital, Colombo, bear the evidence of this week's rioting - a heavy police presence, troops on the streets, and overturned and burnt buses after Monday's violence. Why Sri Lankans want their rulers thrown out The divisions behind Sri Lanka's united protests Sri Lankans left desperate over medicine hikes Nonetheless, protesters continue to gather despite the curfew at Galle Face Green. They insist President Rajapaksa has grossly mismanaged the economy and must stand aside. He is the last Rajapaksa family member in office and the resignation of his brother as prime minister did nothing to placate demonstrators or bring calm. Protesters blame Gotabaya (right) and Mahinda Rajapaksa for the current crisis President Rajapaska says he is holding talks with other political parties aimed at forming a unity government. But the main opposition  has said it will not be part of the interim administration unless the president stands down. At present, there is no clarity on which political parties might come together to form such a government. The political stalemate comes as Sri Lanka attempts to iron out a bailout package with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) - the island's $81bn economy is near bankruptcy. It has suspended its foreign debt payments, largely because it cannot service loans from China that paid for massive infrastructure projects. While the pandemic hit the vital tourism sector and shrank Sri Lanka's earnings and foreign exchange reserves, experts say problems have been exacerbated by populist tax cuts in 2019 and a disastrous ban on chemical fertilisers in 2021 that devastated crop yields. Protesters gathered in front of Trincomalee Naval Base in the north-east after reports that Mahinda Rajapaksa had fled there with his family after escaping from his Colombo residence when it was besieged by crowds on Monday night. The military confirmed on Wednesday that he was inside the base. ""We took Mahinda to the naval base for safety reasons,"" the defence secretary said. Earlier, there had been rumours that Mr Rajapaksa and others in the family had fled to India, which the Indian High Commission in Colombo denied. Anbarasan Ethirajan, BBC News, Colombo Sri Lankans are still reeling from the violence that has erupted. Many politicians are sheltering in safe houses or avoiding appearing in public. ""It is not at all safe, particularly for politicians on the government side,"" Nalaka Godahewa, until recently media minister, told the BBC. His house was among those torched. Mahinda Rajapaksa, once celebrated by the majority Sinhalese as a war hero for defeating the Tamil Tiger rebels, has suddenly become a villain. Many blame his supporters for targeting anti-government protesters, which then set off a chain of violent events. The Rajapaksas have always stood together, but this time, their differences are out in the open.

Holiday bookings surge but no late deals - Tui,"Holiday giant Tui has said it expects summer bookings to ""almost reach"" 2019 levels this year, but warned there will be ""no last minute"" low price deals. The company said bookings had surged in the past six weeks as people planned for summer breaks after the easing of Covid travel restrictions. But it warned the impact of Covid and the Ukraine war on customer behaviour remained ""difficult to predict"". Tui's boss warned of price rises and limited offers due to high fuel costs. ""There will be practically no last minute offers at low prices this summer,"" said Fritz Joussen. Tui's losses halved to â¬614.5m (Â£525m) in the six months to March, as it hailed a strong recovery in customer demand. How are travel rules being relaxed? Holiday bookings jump as Covid travel tests axed As a result, the company told its shareholders it could return to profit by the end of the year. ""The high demand for travel and the very good business performance confirm our forecasts,"" said Mr Joussen. ""2022 will be a good financial year. Capacity almost reaches pre-corona level of 2019."" He added: ""After two years of crisis, we expect Tui to become profitable again in the current financial year... This is the basis for new growth."" Tui told the BBC Greece was its most popular destination currently, closely followed by the Canary and Balearic Islands and Turkey. In the past three months, 1.9 million customers flew with Tui which was an increase of 1.7 million compared to the same period in 2021 when global travel was on its knees due to the pandemic. The firm said bookings for summer holidays were currently at 85% of 2019 levels, with reservations from UK customers up 11% on two years ago. With Covid travel restrictions receding, demand for overseas summer holidays is coming back with a bang. And for Tui, UK holidaymakers are leading the way back to the beach. The tour operator says people are spending more on summer trips, for example going for longer and taking more package tours. The optimism isn't completely un-clouded. Tui -  like other travel businesses  - will be keeping an eye on how the Ukraine war, inflation and any future travel restrictions affect consumers' behaviour. Many airports and some airlines had a tricky Easter holiday period. Some simply didn't have enough staff to cope with the sudden surge in demand. But this is another sign that lots of people still want to go away, and they are getting booking. In fact, people trying to book summer trips or hotels at the last minute might find their options limited as lots of other people have got there first. The phasing out of UK testing rules in February has resulted in growing demand for flights and holidays. However, some countries still expect travellers to follow isolation and testing requirements. On Tuesday, Heathrow Airport said it had seen strong demand in April and forecast that passenger numbers will grow this summer. However, the UK's biggest airport said demand would only hit 65% of pre-pandemic levels overall for the year as rising prices force customers to cut back. The Bank of England expects inflation - the rate at which prices rise - to breach 10% later this year, putting the UK at risk of recession. ""The ongoing war in Ukraine, higher fuel costs, continuing travel restrictions for key markets like the United States and the potential for a further variant of concern creates uncertainty going forward,"" the airport said.

Food and energy bills warning for 1.5m households,"Faith Angwet told the BBC there was no support to help her pay rising food and energy bills Single mum Faith Angwet struggled to make ends meet during the pandemic but says the cost of living crisis has hit her even harder. ""I was starting to feel like I was getting to a good place but now the price of everything has gone up it has pushed me right back,"" she said. Ms Angwet is one of an estimated 1.5m UK households that will struggle to pay food and energy bills in the next year. That's according to research which also predicts a UK recession in 2022. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) has also warned that a combination of rising prices andmeasures announced in the Chancellor's Spring Statement- such as the decision not to scrap a planned rise in National Insurance tax - are hitting the poorest households hardest. Ms Angwet, 36, from Southwark in south London, is a single mother-of-two who has been unemployed since having her daughter two years ago. ""In the pandemic if you couldn't afford something you could shop around or buy in bulk. But now you can't afford it everywhere. And if I am able to buy in bulk, if the kids see it they want to eat it now. So I find myself hiding things from them so I can bring it out another day like magic."" Faith Angwet said plans to take her children to the beach would have to be pushed back due to rising costs Things have got so bad that Ms Angwet sometimes forgoes her prescription for blood pressure medication so she can afford to buy formula and nappies for her daughter. As she is unemployed, she cannot get any other form of benefit or financial help from the government so has turned to food banks for support. She said her five-year-old son's free school meals were a ""huge help"" and that she was grateful for nappies and clothes from Little Village baby bank. ""It's got to the point that I turned to a payday loan, but they want you to borrow more than you need. We can't always go to the food bank, it's a vicious cycle,"" she said. Why are prices rising so quickly? Warning of economic downturn as interest rates rise Five ways the Ukraine war could push up prices Inflation - the rate at which prices rise - is at a 30-year high, as the Ukraine war drives up fuel and energy prices. The Bank of England has warned inflation might reach 10% within months. The think tank urged the government to raise Universal Credit by Â£25 per week between May and October, which would cost around Â£1.35bn, and give Â£250 each to 11.3 million lower income households. ""Without this targeted support we expect a further increase in extreme poverty,"" the think tank said, with about a quarter of a million households sliding into extreme poverty, taking the number to about a million. About half a million households would ""face the choice between eating and heating"" without these payments, it said, adding that the chancellor had a reported Â£20bn of ""headroom"" for government spending that could be used to cushion the shock to income. The think tank predicted that inflation would average 7.8% in 2022 and will remain above 3% until 2024 - above the Bank of England's 2% target. At the same time, economic growth is set to slow. While NIESR forecast that UK economic growth in 2022 would increase by 3.5% on average, it predicted a fall in the final two quarters of the year. This would push the UK into a recession, which is two consecutive quarters of economic decline. Meanwhile, government policies are set to leave households with even less disposable income, according to NIESR. It forecasts household income when adjusted for inflation will fall by 2.4% in 2022, along with a small rise in unemployment next year. Tony Danker, director general of the CBI, which represents big businesses, told the BBC's Today programme that companies were suffering too. He said inflation, higher energy prices, labour shortages and the war in Ukraine had made firms ""pause before investing"", and that this was stopping them ""creating jobs and paying good wages"". He said the government needed to create ""reasons to invest"" such as subsidising the shift to clean energy or cutting business rates for shops. ""If we wait... the economy will end up in more trouble,"" he added. ""Get firms investing now because that will stop us facing dire consequences later on."" Fears as energy hike hits disabled families Money tips: How to cut spending as energy bills rise Professor Stephen Millard, NIESR's deputy director for macroeconomics, said: ""Although the war in Ukraine is fundamentally a human tragedy, it has resulted in another supply shock for the UK economy: pushing down growth and pushing up on inflation."" He added: ""We need fiscal policy to loosen and monetary policy to tighten if the UK economy is going to sail safely through these treacherous seas."" A Treasury spokesperson said the country has had a ""strong economic recovery"" from the pandemic but acknowledged that these are ""anxious times"", and said the government is taking action to support households. ""This includes a tax cut of over Â£330 a year for the typical employee, lowering the Universal Credit taper rate to help people keep more of the money they earn, and providing millions of households with up to Â£350 each to help with rising energy bills,"" the spokesperson said. ""Public debt is at the highest levels since the 1960s and rising inflation is pushing up our debt interest costs, which means we must manage public finances sustainably to avoid saddling future generations with further debt."" Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said the government should bring in an emergency budget ""urgently"", adding: ""With a one-off windfall tax on oil and gas producer profits we can cut household bills by up to Â£600 and support businesses through the cost of living storm."" It comes as NIESR separately forecast that global economic growth would be 1% lower, or about $1.5tn, at the end of 2022, due to the Ukraine war.

We're closing our live coverage of the war in Ukraine for today in a little while. We'll leave you with a brief recap of what's happened: Fighting in the east  Beyond the Donbas region  In diplomacy  You can read about more of the day's key events here. Ukraine has said it is returning the bodies of fallen Russian troops back home. On Friday, military officials were seen loading and stacking bodies collected from the Kyiv and Chernihiv regions onto refrigerated rail cars. The move is in accordance with ""the norms of international humanitarian law"", according to Volodymyr Lyamzin, the head of Ukraine's civil-military cooperation. ""After the active phase of the conflict is over, sides have to return the bodies of the military of another country. Ukraine is ready to return the bodies to the aggressor,â Lyamzin told the Reuters news agency. Several refrigerated trains have reportedly been stationed in other parts of the country as well. Ukraine claims it has killed some 20,000 Russian troops. Russia has not updated its death toll since 25 March, when it acknowledged 1,351 deaths. TheBBC Ukrainian serviceis reporting that the Ukrainian army has released two decks of cards depicting Russians they suspect of war crimes. The idea replicates the set of55 playing cardsthat the US military produced in the 2003 invasion of Iraq, depicting what it said were the most wanted members of Saddam Hussein's government. Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Valerii Zaluzhnyi, said the cards were produced with the help of volunteers from the international intelligence community InformNapalm. US President Joe Biden has spoken with the leaders of Finland and Sweden about their plans to join the Nato alliance. The White House said Biden had held a joint phone call with Finnish President Sauli NiinistÃ¶ and Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson about the issue on Friday. A readout of the call claims the trio discussed Natoâs Open Door policy and ""the right of Finland and Sweden to decide their own future, foreign policy, and security arrangements"". Afterwards, NiinistÃ¶ wrote on Twitter that he ""went through Finland's next steps towards Nato membership"" on the call. It comes a day after NiinistÃ¶ and Finland's PM Sanna Marin called for the historically neutral country to apply for Nato membership ""without delay"". Sweden will announce its own decision on joining Nato on Sunday. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

As we reported on Thursday, a US lawmaker has single-handedly blocked a multi billion-dollar aid package to Ukraine from passing this week. President Joe Biden had called on Congress to send the bill - $39.8bn in economic, humanitarian and security assistance - to his desk by the end of the week, but Senator Rand Paul blocked an expedited vote on Thursday evening alleging that the government was ""shuffling money out the door as fast as they can"" with no oversight. ""My oath of office is to the US Constitution, not to any foreign nation,"" Paul said on the Senate floor defending his decision. ""We cannot save Ukraine by dooming the US economy."" The senator from Kentucky is calling for a watchdog provision in the bill to oversee how the money is being spent, an amendment that would require further delays in the bill's passage. Congressional leaders have chided the congressman for causing the delay, as the current bill has enough votes to pass in the Senate through regular order but this will now not happen until next week. Paul's defiance has been lauded in some corners, with former president Donald Trump's son arguing lawmakers in Washington - or ""the swamp"" as he called them - ""don't want transparency"".

Sweden and Finland have said that they will hold talks with the Turkish government after its president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, said he was not in favour of their plans to join Nato. The Swedish and Finnish foreign ministers, Ann Linde and Pekka Haavisto said they would speak to their Turkish counterpart, Mevlut Cavusoglu, about the issue at a Nato meeting on Saturday. Erdogan said that Nordic countries had given asylum to people Turkey considers to be Kurdish terrorists. He added that he did not want Nato to repeat what he called the mistake of the past when it allowed Greece to join. Responding to Turkey's comments, the US said Turkey ""is a valued Nato ally"" and ""they've been involved and helpful in trying to get a dialogue going here, between Russia and Ukraine"". John Kirby, press secretary for the US Ministry of Defence, added ""we're working to better clarify the [Turkey's] position here"". Law enforcement officers in Ukraine are investigating 41 Russian servicemen suspected of having committed war crimes in the country, Interfax-Ukraine news agency reports. Prosecutor-General Iryna Venediktova said the suspects will be investigated for a range of crimes - from the bombing of civilian infrastructure, killing of civilians, rape and looting. The suspects will answer before a Ukrainian court of law, she added. Today, a Russian soldier accused of killing an unarmed 62-year-old civilian appeared in court in Kyiv. Vadim Shishimarin, 21, was brought to court for a preliminary hearing. He faces possible life imprisonment on charges of war crimes and premeditated murder. During a televised address on Friday evening, Venediktova said preliminary hearings on two more suspects will be carried out next week. The leader of breakaway region South Ossetia has announced a referendum on whether to become a part of Russia. A statement from the office of Anatoly Bibilov said it was his people's ""historic aspiration"" to come together with Russia, and the vote would take place on 17 July. Moscow recognises the region as independent, after a brief war between Russia and Georgia in 2008, and has provided financial support, Russian citizenship for its citizens and sited military bases there. Georgia maintains that South Ossetia is an occupied territory and previously said that a referendum on joining Russia would be unacceptable. Negotiations with Russia over freeing the Ukrainian fighters under siege in the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol were ""very difficult"", Ukraine's deputy prime minister has said. In an online post, Iryna
Vereshchuk wrote: ""The result may not be to everyone's liking, but our task is
to evacuate our boys. All of them. ""Alive."" Yesterday, the Ukrainian government said that it was pushing for safe passage for 38 badly wounded fighters, in exchange for captured Russians. The Azovstal complex once sheltered hundreds of civilians and fighters, but after several weeks trapped underground civilians were freed in a series of humanitarian convoys last week and negotiations over the fighters began. The Russian air force has attacked an arms depot in the Kharkiv region in Ukraine, state news agency RIA reports. The news agency quoted the Russian defence ministry saying it had hit the facility on Friday. Meanwhile, eyewitnesses to an earlier attack in Kharkiv told news agency AFP that they had been targeted by a Russian tank as they tried to seek shelter at home. ""Four people died, two were injured. My daughter died from a shrapnel wound in the back of her head,"" Olga Karpenko, 52, said. The BBC has not been able to independently verify this information. Sergei Shoigu (pictured) spoke with his US counterpart for an hour More details have emerged of the telephone call between US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin and Russia's Defence Minister Sergei Shoygu, in which General Austin called for an immediate ceasefire. Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said that Gen Austin had stressed the importance of maintaining communication, after Moscow had appeared uninterested in speaking to the US on previous attempts to hold the conversation. An anonymous US official said the tone of the hour-long call was ""professional"", but did not resolve any specific issues or lead to changes in Russian policy, news agency Reuters report. Russia's defence ministry confirmed that the US had initiated the call, and discussed ""topical issues of international security... including the situation in Ukraine"". Olga IvshinaSenior correspondent, BBC News Russian Since the start of the war, our team has been following and verifying reports of losses among Russian troops fighting in Ukraine by following official announcements, local media reports as well as social media and speaking to the relatives of Russian servicemen. Up to this moment BBC News Russian has been able to verify the deaths of 2,336 Russian servicemen. We have been able to establish their names, ranks and military units where they served. This is nearly twice the latest official figure released by the Russian Defence Ministry in March. It is likely that the real figure of the Russian military in Ukraine is far higher than we have been able to establish. But our data analysis helps to see the trends of what is happening with the Russian army fighting in Ukraine. Nearly 20% of all confirmed military casualties are officers. This proportion has remained unchanged for the past three months. Experts say that Russian officers may have to risk more on the frontline because of persistent problems with communications. Over 25% of all losses are paratroopers and marines. These units are often used in reconnaissance and storming operations. However they often donât get enough operational support and evacuation opportunities for the wounded. Most of the casualties, confirmed by us, came from the least developed and economically deprived regions of Russia. There are only three confirmed deaths of servicemen from Moscow, even though the capital makes up almost 9% of the Russian population. Ukrainian authorities now say that nearly 27,000 Russian soldiers have been killed. Read the full story on the BBC's Russian service here. As we've been reporting, Ukraine's Defence Minister Oleksiy Reznikov has said the country is entering a new stage of the war. Reznikov pledged to arm a million fighters using the new weapons and military equipment the US and other Western countries have been donating to the country over the last couple of weeks. The defence minister said that during the beginning of the war, ""volunteers were extremely helpful"" and it's thanks to their mobility that they ""quickly resolved highly pressing issues"". Reznikov said that to win, Ukraine ""must plan resources carefully and avoid mistakes"" and was investing in Ukrainian production facilities to ""ensure the stability and frequency of deliveries"". In his statement on Facebook, he said that Ukraine had relied on charitable aid from citizens, volunteers, and civic organisations for a significant proportion of its military equipment. He said that at the end of April, Ukraine's ministry of defence was relying on donations for 50% of the bullet proof vests used in combat. But as of 13 May, Ukraine has managed to increase its production to provide 57% of the armed forces' bullet proof vests, he added. More now on the suspension of electricity exports from Russia to Finland, which followed rising tensions over Helsinki's announcement of its plan to join Nato. RAO Nordic, a subsidiary of the Russian company Inter RAO, said non-payment was behind its decision to halt electrity supplies. The company said they had not received funds since 6 May and described the situation as ""exceptional"", adding that it is the first time it's happened ""in over 20 years of our trading history"". It did not specify whether this was due to the impact of sanctions but added, ""we hope that the situation will get improved soon and the electricity trade with Russia could resume"". Meanwhlle, the Finnish grid operator Fingrid said it did not anticpate any problems with supply as a result of the suspension. It said it would make up the shortfall by generating more power domestically and increasing imports from Sweden. This video can not be played Scenes of devastation as 'Russian battalion destroyed' If you're just joining us, here's a little recap of the latest events in Ukraine to bring you up to speed. Russian bridge-building foiled  Beyond the Donbas region  In diplomacy Ukraine's defence minister has said he hopes to arm a million fighters as the country prepares for a ""new, long phase of war"". Oleksiy Reznikov noted in a Facebook post that Ukraine would ""need to meticulously plan resources"" and ""avoid mistakes"" in order to win the war. Already, he said, Russia had suffered a ""strategic defeat"". The arrival of foreign weapons and ""stimulating Ukrainian producers"" would help further tip the balance against Russia, he continued. But before that, Ukraine was ""facing extremely difficult weeks ahead"". ""Nobody can tell how many. In that period, we will hold the defence primarily with our own resources against the enemy mad with rage,"" he predicted, in comments translated by our colleagues at BBC Monitoring. ""Increasing pressure of sanctions against Russia and increasing foreign assistance to Ukraine should create, within several months, the conditions under which the Kremlin will finally lose all chances to achieve any success. Then a new window of opportunity will appear for Ukraine. In this extremely hard period, we need unity, cohesion, will and patience,"" he concluded. Electricity exports from Russia to Finland are being suspended from 01:00 local time (22:00 GMT) on Saturday. Finnish grid operator Fingrid said Russian utility Inter RAO was stopping supplies due to ""problems in receiving payments for electricity sold on the market"". The announcement comes the day after Finland signalled its intention to join Nato. Finland only buys 10% of its electricity from Russia, and according to Fingrid it will make up the shortfall by sourcing more power from Sweden, and increasing generation in Finland. Finland expects to become self-sufficient in electrical energy in 2023, the company added. Sophie WilliamsBBC News, Lviv Ukraine says it's thwarted Russian attempts to create a key bridging point A Ukrainian military analyst admits that constant attacks
from Moscow mean the Ukrainians are on the back foot around the Siversky Donets
river â even though theyâve managed to thwart Russian attempts to put down
bridges near Severodonetsk. âThe advantage is now on the side of the Russian Federation,â
Oleh Zhdanov tells the BBC. âWe still can't bring down Russia's offensive pace.â Zhdanov says itâs âvery importantâ that his
side keeps control of this part of the Siversky Donets. Gaining the area would allow the Russians to make a
bridgehead and advance in the direction of the riverâs estuary, Zhdanov explains.
This would let them encircle the key city of Severodonetsk more fully as they
attempt to cut off Ukraineâs whole eastern Donbas region. The order for soldiers to gain this territory came
from the very top, Zhdanov adds. âThey are advancing so hard because it is a
political task, because Putin has ordered it,â he says. As weâve been reporting today, UK
defence intelligence says a Russian battalion lost almost all its armoured
vehicles during failed attempts to establish bridges across the river. Russia
has not commented. Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoygu and his US counterpart Lloyd Austin have spoken for the first time since 18 February - before Russia invaded Ukraine. According to a statement issued by the Pentagon, Austin urged an immediate ceasefire in Ukraine and used the call to emphasise the importance of maintaining lines of communication. On Wednesday, Austin held talks with UK Defence Minister Ben Wallace. In a statement, Wallace said the two leaders pledged ""to continue to work with unity and resolve to provide
Ukraine with what it needs to defend itself against Russiaâs
unprovoked invasion"". Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
"Relentless, unbearable, overwhelming â the condition affecting one in four","Jen Proudler lives in constant pain and is desperate for a better way to manage her condition. Relentless. Unbearable. Overwhelming. These are just some of the words used by the thousands of people who have revealed their battle with long-term, persistent pain. Anexclusive survey of over 4,000 adults aged 16-75 for BBC News, carried out by research company Ipsos, suggests that a quarter of people in the UK are living with chronic pain - an often hidden and misunderstood condition. And pain specialists warn the health service is not set up to deal with such complex conditions. They say the treatments on offer are decades behind the science, leaving millions of patients without the support they need to manage their pain. Chronic pain - defined as pain that lasts longer than three months - can drastically change people's lives. It can be caused by a physical problem - such as a slipped disc, but can also occur with no clear cause - known as primary pain. It destroys careers, breaks up relationships, steals independence and denies people the futures they had imagined. Jen Proudler says chronic pain has left her grieving for ""the person she was"". It started four years ago with sporadic back pain, which she managed with the help of hot baths and paracetamol. Now she relies on opioid patches, anti-inflammatories, nerve pain medications and beta-blockers just to get through the day. ""It has flipped everything upside down,"" she says. ""I feel I've lost every part of my life. I've lost me."" Jen, 38, who lives with her partner in Farsley near Leeds, was working as a dental hygienist and had a busy social life when she first started experiencing pain in February 2018. Jen Proudler used to work as a dental hygienist - a job she loved Her doctor said it was a problem with a disc in her back and advised taking some time off. Jen rested for about eight weeks, then went back to work. The pain hadn't gone away but she felt she needed to get back to ""some kind of normality"". ""There were days when it was really bad, but I have this attitude of battling through it, because that's what you do,"" she says. But nine months after the pain first began, Jen was driving to work when she felt the most excruciating pain. ""It was how I would imagine being kicked in the back by a horse."" Later that day she lost all sensation in her right leg. That was the last time she made it to work. After several incorrect diagnoses, Jen was eventually told by a neurosurgeon that she had a ""pretty massive"" far lateral disc herniation in her spine - a slipped disc that then compresses the nerves around it. But by then something was going on - her body's defence system had gone into overdrive in response to the agony she was experiencing. The pain has now spread around her body - Jen has burning pins and needles sensations down her leg, as well as sharp pain, as if being cut by a razor. Sometimes it's so bad, she can't even bear any fabric to touch it. ""Our nervous system becomes more and more protective, it feels danger and sends warning signals - and those warning signals contribute to the pain,"" explains Dr Chris Barker, clinical director of an NHS community pain service in Ainsdale, Merseyside.

Yet the results from BBC's Ipsos survey suggest nearly a quarter of those who live with chronic pain are currently taking opioids - ranging from medication such as codeine to more powerful painkillers like morphine and fentanyl. Opioids are useful for short-term, acute pain, but there is little evidence they help long-term, persistent pain. Despite this, opioid prescribing more than doubled between 1998 to 2018. It prompted the MHRA, the UK's medicine regulator, to issue stronger warnings around the risk of addiction and overdose. Our research suggests that more than 40% of those currently using opioids began taking them over five years ago, before these warnings were issued. Sitting at her kitchen table, packets of pills stacked up nearby, Jen says every day now revolves around managing her pain. Despite the support of her GP, she is struggling to see a way forward. She says the medication helps her function, but she worries she's running out of options in the long term. Pain specialists believe the science calls for a different approach involving more support, more tailored care and most importantly, more options of how to cope with such a life-changing condition. Chronic pain: Antidepressants not painkillers recommended Dr Cathy Stannard, clinical lead on persistent pain for NICE, says medication like opioids has very little benefit for people with certain types of chronic pain. She fears millions of patients are not getting the bespoke treatment needed for such a complex condition. But the other options are a difficult sell to a patient in distress - especially in an under-pressure health service where they often don't get the chance to build up a trusting, empathetic relationship. ""People who are living with pain very understandably present with high levels of distress. When they say, 'Are you going to leave me in pain?' it is very difficult to say 'Yes.' It is always with the best intentions that we prescribe medicines, but often, it is a response to distress rather than a rational clinical decision."" Patients tend to need the support of their GP, physiotherapists, psychologists and pharmacists. Depending on the condition, medication can be helpful but may only be part of the treatment - other elements that help include: Exercise Physical therapies (hot or cold packs, massage, hydrotherapy) Physiotherapy Acupuncture Psychological therapies (trauma therapy, cognitive behaviour therapy, meditation) Community support groups Dr Stannard stresses the NICE guidelines were not written to take medication away from people who feel it is helping them. The problem, she says, is the lack of options or tailored treatment for such a complex condition - and too often medication becomes the only answer, instead of part of it. And no-one should stop or change their medication without speaking to their doctor. Benjamin Ellis, a consultant rheumatologist and senior policy advisor for the charity Versus Arthritis, agrees, and says that while opioids can help people manage some conditions like osteoarthritis, too often they are seen as a long-term answer. ""The health system is set up to support the prescribing of medication rather than supporting patients to access other treatments - physical activity, programmes to help people with their mental health, community support, peer support - they're not so readily available, and even where they are, they're not well connected with health services."" Lorraine English's story illustrates the potential dangers of being prescribed opioids long term. She was a busy single mum with four kids, working as a teaching assistant, when she started to notice pain that had started in her neck and spread into her head and back. It led to her taking high doses of opioids, including morphine, for 12 years - at times she says she felt like her life was over. ""It was so frightening, so isolating"". With the help of her GP, Lorraine has weaned herself off opioids Lorraine, from Burnage, south Manchester, was eventually diagnosed with degenerative disc disease, osteoarthritis and fibromyalgia - a condition which causes all-over body pain and extreme tiredness. ""I would get nerve pain shooting through my head and it would cause migraines, light-sensitivity - just my heel touching the floor would send pain up into my head."" As the pain continued, her opioid dose increased, while her ability to cope decreased. Eventually she had to give up work, taking pill after pill to beat what is known as ""breakthrough pain"" - a flare-up of pain despite being on huge doses of painkillers. For the last three years of her life on morphine, Lorraine was unable to function - bed-bound, existing in a fog of medication, her life ruled by pain. ""It's like being in a medicated coma and you can't reach out to anybody, because you're not even aware anyone's out there. I felt like that for years, just laid in bed with my kids checking on me, asking, 'You okay?'"" Lorraine kept a pain diary in 2017 which she hoped would help but just reminds her of how difficult her life was. Lorraine says she realised that she needed to reduce her medication - not only was she struggling to function, but she felt it was making the pain worse. It took nearly a year, but with the help of her GP, Lorraine has gradually tapered off her opioid medication, and the pain has reduced. Now opioid-free, she says she has learned to ""embrace"" the pain she still feels, and understand her body's limits. ""No matter how much pain I am in, I want to be able to manage it so I can hug my grandkids,"" she says.

"Chronic pain treatments failing millions, say experts","Jen Proudler lives in constant pain and is desperate for a better way to manage her condition. Relentless. Unbearable. Overwhelming. These are just some of the words used by the thousands of people who have revealed their battle with long-term, persistent pain. Anexclusive survey of over 4,000 adults aged 16-75 for BBC News, carried out by research company Ipsos, suggests that a quarter of people in the UK are living with chronic pain - an often hidden and misunderstood condition. And pain specialists warn the health service is not set up to deal with such complex conditions. They say the treatments on offer are decades behind the science, leaving millions of patients without the support they need to manage their pain. Chronic pain - defined as pain that lasts longer than three months - can drastically change people's lives. It can be caused by a physical problem - such as a slipped disc, but can also occur with no clear cause - known as primary pain. It destroys careers, breaks up relationships, steals independence and denies people the futures they had imagined. Jen Proudler says chronic pain has left her grieving for ""the person she was"". It started four years ago with sporadic back pain, which she managed with the help of hot baths and paracetamol. Now she relies on opioid patches, anti-inflammatories, nerve pain medications and beta-blockers just to get through the day. ""It has flipped everything upside down,"" she says. ""I feel I've lost every part of my life. I've lost me."" Jen, 38, who lives with her partner in Farsley near Leeds, was working as a dental hygienist and had a busy social life when she first started experiencing pain in February 2018. Jen Proudler used to work as a dental hygienist - a job she loved Her doctor said it was a problem with a disc in her back and advised taking some time off. Jen rested for about eight weeks, then went back to work. The pain hadn't gone away but she felt she needed to get back to ""some kind of normality"". ""There were days when it was really bad, but I have this attitude of battling through it, because that's what you do,"" she says. But nine months after the pain first began, Jen was driving to work when she felt the most excruciating pain. ""It was how I would imagine being kicked in the back by a horse."" Later that day she lost all sensation in her right leg. That was the last time she made it to work. After several incorrect diagnoses, Jen was eventually told by a neurosurgeon that she had a ""pretty massive"" far lateral disc herniation in her spine - a slipped disc that then compresses the nerves around it. But by then something was going on - her body's defence system had gone into overdrive in response to the agony she was experiencing. The pain has now spread around her body - Jen has burning pins and needles sensations down her leg, as well as sharp pain, as if being cut by a razor. Sometimes it's so bad, she can't even bear any fabric to touch it. ""Our nervous system becomes more and more protective, it feels danger and sends warning signals - and those warning signals contribute to the pain,"" explains Dr Chris Barker, clinical director of an NHS community pain service in Ainsdale, Merseyside. He says such pain can be hard to diagnose, and the difficulty of getting the correct treatment can make things worse. ""Incorrect diagnoses, delayed diagnoses, poor experiences in and out of the health system, not being believed - all of these can contribute to a more intense experience of pain.""

Ukraine secures passage to Eurovision final,"Kalush Orchestra were given special permission to leave Ukraine while the war continues. Ukraine's Kalush Orchestra are through to the final of the Eurovision Song Contest, cementing their position as favourites to win the competition. The folk-rap band jumped to their feet, waving the Ukrainian flag as it was announced they had qualified from the first semi-final in Turin. Earlier, they gave an energetic performance of their song Stefania. ""Thank you for supporting Ukraine,"" said founder member Oleh Psiuk as they finished their performance. The audience at the Pala Alpitour responded with a mixture of joy and emotion. Deafening applause was accompanied by genuine tears. This video can not be played Watch: Ukrainian fans celebrate in Turin as the Kalush Orchestra qualify for Eurovision final Support for the band has swelled since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February. Speaking to the BBC before the semi-final, Psiuk said a victory would send a message of support to the country's besieged citizens, and the estimated 12 million people who have fled the country. ""For our country it is so important to have victories in all ways,"" he said. ""So if we win, it will be another opportunity to show Ukraine to the world, to remind people about Ukraine, and to increase morale in the whole country."" When a president tried to intervene in Eurovision... Who will win Eurovision? And other questions answered How Eurovision is bringing Europe together again Sam Ryder to represent UK at Eurovision 2022 Watch the first semi-final on BBC iPlayer But the band were at pains to point out that their success isn't just an expression of solidarity. ""Even before the war, we were in fifth position according to bookmakers,"" they said in a press conference last week, ""which means this Ukrainian song is already enjoyed by Europeans."" Their song, Stefania, was written in tribute to Psiuk's mother, but emotive lyrics like ""I will always walk to you by broken roads"" have been re-interpreted as a rallying cry. Speaking after the semi-final, Psiuk thanked everyone who voted and said Lakush Orchestra were ""totally focused"" on the final, ""because we are here to show that Ukrainian culture is alive"". Russia, meanwhile,has been banned from competingin this year's contest, with organisers saying the country's participation could ""bring the competition into disrepute"". Sibling trio Systur qualified for the final for Iceland Tuesday's semi-final allowed 10 acts to progress to Saturday's final. They were (in no particular order): Switzerland - Marius Bear: Boys Do Cry Armenia - Rosa Linn: Snap Iceland - Systur: MeÃ° hÃ¦kkandi sÃ³l Lithuania - Monika Liu: Sentimental Portugal - Maro: Saudade, Saudade Norway - Subwoolfer: Give That Wolf A Banana Greece - Amanda Tenfjord: Die Together Ukraine - Kalush Orchestra: Stefania Moldova - Zdob Èi Zdub and Advahov Brothers: TrenuleÈul Netherlands - S10: De Diepte That meant popular songs like Latvia's ""vegetarian anthem"" Eat Your Salad and Austria's EDM banger Halo failed to make the cut. The other countries whose journey ended on Tuesday were Albania, Slovenia, Bulgaria, Croatia and Denmark. Ten more acts will progress to the main competition after Thursday's second semi-final. The ""Big Five"" countries, who contribute the most financially to the competition (France, Germany, Spain, the UK and Italy) qualify automatically. Ronela Hajati had been expected to progress to the final, but Eurovision watchers say acts that perform earlier in the show are often at a disadvantage The first semi-final opened with a set-piece song and dance number called The Sound of Beauty which incorporated elements of Puccini's Nessun Dorma and last year's winning song Zitti E Buoni, by Italian rock band MÃ¥neskin. But the competition kicked off in earnest with Ronela Hajati - Albania's answer to Madonna, whose song Sekret was about a romantic tryst with a boy ""who came from the mountains"". Her high-octane routine, full of hair whipping and shirtless male dancers, was a suitably bombastic opening, but failed to attract enough votes to progress. The same fate befell Latvia's technicolour whirlwind Citi ZÄni, whose song attempted to convince viewers that ""being green is sexy"". BBC Three hosts Scott Mills and Rylan Clark were forced to apologise for the band, after fans in the arena shouted out swear words that had been censored from the song during their performance. Citi ZÄni's failure to qualify suggested fans had grown tired of novelty... until Norway secured a place in the final Maro's delicate song of grief proved popular, with a simple but effective staging Portugal's Maro, who brought a delicate intimacy to the competition with her touching ballad Saudade, Saudade, which is dedicated to her late grandfather. The chorus of the song featured a mournful, meditative repetition of the word ""saudade"" - which doesn't have a direct translation in English, but which the singer says represents ""the desire to have someone back when you know you can't"". Voters were obviously in the mood for a ballad, with the similarly chilled-out Icelandic folk act Systur, unexpectedly gaining a place in the final. The band, whose song MeÃ° HÃ¦kkandi SÃ³l translates as ""with the rising sun"", is formed of three sisters SigrÃ­Ã°ur, ElÃ­sabet and ElÃ­n EyÃ¾Ã³rsdÃ³ttir, making them the Haim of Eurovision 2022. ""We're a small nation, we get lost in Europe, so it means the world to us,"" said SigrÃ­Ã°ur in a press conference after the semi-final. ""We were just focusing on the message of the song, and we wanted to bring hope to people that are going through hard times, like Ukraine, and all of us that have been struggling through Covid."" Subwoolfer's banana-based song has built a cult following But perhaps the best reaction in the arena went to Norway's Subwoolfer - a group formed ""4.5 billion years ago on the moon"", whose brilliantly deranged Give That Wolf A Banana brought a much-needed dose of Eurovision madness. The band, who are rumoured to include Ben Adams from the British boyband A1, hide their identities behind giant yellow wolf masks. Equally in keeping with Eurovision's comical side were Moldovan act Zdob Èi Zdub and Advahov Brothers, whose song TrenuleÈul is about the rail link between the Moldovan capital, ChiÈinÄu, and Bucharest in Romania. (No, really.) The folk-punk curio was another surprise qualifier for Saturday's final, although it's worth bearing in mind that Zdob Èi Zdub have prior form at Eurovision, coming sixth in 2005 and 12th in 2011. The UK's Sam Ryder will make his debut during Thursday's second semi-final... although he is guaranteed his place in the final. The TikTok star has risen to become second favourite to win the competition after a series of impressive rehearsals in Turin, but almost any position would be an improvement on the last two contests, where the UK came last.

What is levelling up?,"MPs have criticised levelling up schemes after finding that only 10% of the promised funding has been spent so far. The Public Accounts Committee also criticised a lack of transparency in how the money was allocated. Levelling up is a government policy to reduce inequality based on where people live. It was a big slogan for the Conservatives in the 2019 election and was inthe party's manifesto,external. Rishi Sunak says its aim is ""to create jobs, drive growth, and make sure that people feel enormous pride in the places that they call home"". Only 10% of flagship levelling up funds spent, say MPs The Levelling Up Fund awarded Â£1.7bn to projects in October 2021, Â£2.1bn in January 2023 and another Â£1.1bn in November 2023. The North West of England received the most money overall, followed by Yorkshire and the Humber. Questions were raised when the South East of England was awarded the second largest amount of funding in the second round. The government highlighted funding per head of the population. If you look at the funding awards this way, Wales comes out on top and the North of England does better than the South of England. The Public Accounts Committee said that only Â£3.7bn had been allocated to local authorities by December 2023, while councils had been able to spend only Â£1.24bn as of Sept 2023. It said the first round of levelling up funding was awarded to ""shovel-ready"" projects that were due to be completed in March, but 60 out of 71 (85%) have had to extend their deadlines, with further delays in other schemes said to be ""likely"". Levelling up funding process is broken, says Conservative mayor Andy Street Levelling up: Cost of living could deepen inequality, says Gove Areas were invited to bid for investment in transport, cultural, town centre and regeneration projects. Local MPs were allowed to give their formal support to two bids before the proposals were judged by officials from the Treasury, Levelling Up Department and Department for Transport. Assessing how fair this is, is not straightforward. Some projects - such as transport - may spread across several constituencies, represented by MPs from different parties. For the projects that can be allocated to a single party, we can say that more money was allocated to Conservative constituencies than to Labour ones. But there are significantly more Conservative ones. BBC analysis of the second round of funding found: 52% of successful bids that can be allocated to a party were in Conservative constituencies (the Conservatives won 56% of seats in the Commons in 2019) 24% of them were in Labour areas (Labour won 31% of the seats in 2019) Projects in Tory constituencies were awarded a total of Â£1.21bn, compared with Â£471m in Labour ones. There was one successful bid in a Lib Dem constituency, seven for the SNP, five for the DUP, three for Sinn Fein, and one each for the Alliance Party and Plaid Cymru. Areas have also been competing for money under the government's Towns Fund. In that contest, of the 56 constituencies that won, 47 had Conservative MPs. A zoo, a park and a pool - who got first round levelling up cash? Towns Fund: How were the winners chosen? On the second round of funding, Rishi Sunak said: ""two thirds of all the levelling up funding is going to the most deprived parts of our country"". BBC analysis shows that using the government'sindex of multiple deprivation,external, which is the usual measure, in the second round about 57% of England's funding went to the areas with the highest deprivation, down from 69% in the first round. That analysis excludes a small number of awards that were given to areas covering multiple local authorities. We asked the Levelling Up department about Mr Sunak's claim. It said it was not based on the government's index of multiple deprivation but was instead based on measures involving productivity, employment, vacancy rates, lack of skills and transport links. Labour said the money awarded was dwarfed by the cuts to local authority funding since 2010, with Alex Norris telling MPs: ""the government have nicked a tenner from our wallets and expect us to be grateful for getting less than two quid back."" The Institute for Fiscal Studies found,externalthat between 2009-10 and 2019-20, English councils' non-education funding per resident had fallen by almost a quarter, after adjusting for rising prices. The Institute for Government found,externalthat councils in the most deprived areas had been worst hit because they were the most reliant on central government funding. Andy Street, the Conservative mayor of the West Midlandscriticised the Levelling Up funding processas being part of Whitehall's ""broken begging bowl culture"". He suggested the money would have been allocated better by local decision-makers than civil servants in London. Some government departments will have a new hub in Darlington Having 22,000 civil servants based outside London by the end of the decade, with a target for 25% of roles to be outside London by 2025 The government wants to level up skills with an extra Â£126m announced in March 2021 to fund work placements and training for 16 to 24-year-olds in England Locations for eight freeports have been chosen in England,external, with two planned in Scotland and two in Wales.

PM: Can't spend way out of trouble,"This video can not be played Queen's speech: Five traditions that changed The government has promised to tackle sharp rises in the cost of living by boosting the economy, as it set out its plans in the Queen's Speech. But Boris Johnson warned that the government could not ""shield everyone"" from the effect of global inflation. Labour has called for an emergency budget to address the cost of living and a windfall tax on energy companies to fund more support for households. This year's Queen's Speech contained 38 bills and draft bills. In the speech, delivered by Prince Charles in the Queen's absence, the government set out the new laws it plans to bring in over the coming year. Priorities included energy security, carbon emissions and post-Brexit economic arrangements - but the opposition parties, and some Tories, said it should have contained more on living costs. Queen's Speech at-a-glance Backlash as workers' rights bill sidelined Government tries again to ban 'guerrilla' protests TheBank of England is warning,externalthat inflation could hit around 10% later this year. The three main opposition parties are all demanding an emergency Budget, with tax cuts and benefit rises to help struggling households. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the legislative agenda set out in the Queen's Speech was ""bereft of ideas"" and ""without a guiding principle or a road map for delivery"". Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey said millions of households would be ""bitterly disappointed"" with the government plans. And SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford accused ministers of a ""deafening silence"" over potential rises in poverty. In response, Mr Johnson argued wider economic reforms would help households, telling MPs: ""However great our compassion and commitment, we cannot simply spend our way out of problems. ""We need to grow our economy out of these problems by creating hundreds of thousands of high-waged, high-skilled jobs across the country."" He also hinted at an announcement on the cost of living in the coming days, although Downing Street said the PM was referring to the wider work being done in departments to address the pressures households face. Prince William was among the senior royals at the Palace of Westminster The political parties will spend several days debating the contents of the Queen's Speech. It includes seven bills that ministers say will help deliver the benefits of Brexit, while a Levelling Up and Regeneration Bill is expected to change planning rules in England. The government said its Energy Security Bill would ""accelerate our transition to more secure, more affordable and cleaner homegrown energy supplies"". Meanwhile, a Public Order Bill would create a criminal offence, with a maximum sentence of 12 months, of ""interfering with key national infrastructure"" such as airports, railways and printing presses. How will the Police and Crime Bill change protests? What is levelling up and how is it going? The Liberal Democrats called the proposed changes ""dangerous and draconian"", but Home Secretary Priti Patel argued they were needed to deal with a ""self-indulgent minority who seem to revel in causing mayhem and misery"". The speech also pledged support for Ukraine and to reduce regional inequality, but trade unions and charities complained about thelack of an Employment Billaimed at improving workers' rights.

Planning reforms paused amid Tory anger,"The government is pausing its controversial planning reforms in England amid an angry backlash from Conservative MPs, government sources have told the BBC. Michael Gove - who was given the role of housing secretary on Wednesday - is said to want to address MPs' concerns. The government has pledged to build 300,000 new homes a year. And ministers had insisted the planning rules needed a radical shake-up to ensure more homes could be delivered. Under their proposals, the current system - where local planning officials assess applications case-by-case - would be replaced with new rules based on zones. Archaeologists dig in over planning reforms row Why do ministers face a backlash on planning rules? Is levelling up about to get the Gove treatment? Councils in England would have to classify all land in their area as ""protected"", for ""renewal"", or for ""growth"". In protected areas, including areas of natural beauty, places at risk of flooding, and the green belt, development would generally remain restricted. But councils would have to look favourably on development in ""renewal"" areas, whilst in ""growth"" zones, applications conforming to pre-agreed local plans would automatically gain initial approval. Local residents would get a say on new 10-year plans underpinning the zones, but their ability to comment on individual applications would be curtailed. Councils would have to plan for a share of homes from the government's 300,000 annual house building target for England. Politicians have generally agreed on the need for more affordable homes in England. In 2020 research conducted bythe BBC found thatthe difference between the current housing stock and the number needed for everyone to have a decent home to live in is more than one million homes However, the plans had been met by resistance from the government's own MPs as well as the opposition. In a Commons debate last year, former Conservative Prime Minister Theresa May described the proposals as ""ill-conceived"" and warned that it would ""build up planning permissions, but not houses"". Earlier this year, the Conservativeslost their previously safe seat of Chesham and Amersham,in part due to local concerns over increased house building. Labour's shadow communities secretary Steve Reed said the reforms should be ""scrapped altogether"" adding that they risked ""selling out communities and gagging residents from having a say over development in their area"". Another Conservative MP, Bob Seely, who had been highly critical of the changes welcomed the pause. He told the BBC he and other MPs would be meeting Mr Gove next week. He said change was needed but expressed concern that the current proposals would give ""too much power to developers"". Theresa May has been a prominent critic of the government's planning proposals Another critic, Conservative Sir Roger Gale, said: ""The zoning concept has got to go and I want a clear undertaking that there will be presumption that top quality agricultural land will not be developed on."" Speaking to the BBC's World at One, Gemma Burgess, a Cambridge University housing expert, said the pause would ""create a period of uncertainty"" and developers and house builders were likely to get ""nervous"" because ""we don't know what's coming next"". Andrew Whitaker, of The Home Builders Federation, said the ""very inefficient"" current system needed reform because it allowed people too many ""bites of the cherry"" when it came to objecting developments. He added that there were ""too many local authorities, particularly in the south-east of Englandâ¦ who don't care about delivering the number of houses that they need in their local area"". The appointment of Mr Gove to the housing department, has been met with apprehension in some quarters, given his reputation as a radical reformer. One Conservative MP told the BBC: ""We can't tell whether he's been appointed to build any and everywhere regardless of the opposition, or whether he's been appointed to deliver some sort of compromise."" A Labour councillor expressed concern Mr Gove would override any opposition to changes, adding ""the fear is he'll fly in, make his mark, and fly out like he did in education"" - a reference to his school reforms and battles with the teachers' unions. Meanwhile, Mr Gove has faced calls to return Â£100,000 in donations from a property developer on 6 August to avoid any conflict of interest. Parliamentary records show that he received two donations of Â£50,000 each from Zachariasz Gertler, a British/German developer. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said: ""The Tories are much more interested in taking developers' cash than they are in building affordable and social housing."" A spokesperson for the Housing, Communities and Local Government said all donations made to Mr Gove ""have been declared publicly and the proper process followed"".

We're closing our live coverage of the war in Ukraine for today in a little while. We'll leave you with a brief recap of what's happened: Fighting in the east  Beyond the Donbas region  In diplomacy  You can read about more of the day's key events here. Ukraine has said it is returning the bodies of fallen Russian troops back home. On Friday, military officials were seen loading and stacking bodies collected from the Kyiv and Chernihiv regions onto refrigerated rail cars. The move is in accordance with ""the norms of international humanitarian law"", according to Volodymyr Lyamzin, the head of Ukraine's civil-military cooperation. ""After the active phase of the conflict is over, sides have to return the bodies of the military of another country. Ukraine is ready to return the bodies to the aggressor,â Lyamzin told the Reuters news agency. Several refrigerated trains have reportedly been stationed in other parts of the country as well. Ukraine claims it has killed some 20,000 Russian troops. Russia has not updated its death toll since 25 March, when it acknowledged 1,351 deaths. TheBBC Ukrainian serviceis reporting that the Ukrainian army has released two decks of cards depicting Russians they suspect of war crimes. The idea replicates the set of55 playing cardsthat the US military produced in the 2003 invasion of Iraq, depicting what it said were the most wanted members of Saddam Hussein's government. Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Valerii Zaluzhnyi, said the cards were produced with the help of volunteers from the international intelligence community InformNapalm. US President Joe Biden has spoken with the leaders of Finland and Sweden about their plans to join the Nato alliance. The White House said Biden had held a joint phone call with Finnish President Sauli NiinistÃ¶ and Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson about the issue on Friday. A readout of the call claims the trio discussed Natoâs Open Door policy and ""the right of Finland and Sweden to decide their own future, foreign policy, and security arrangements"". Afterwards, NiinistÃ¶ wrote on Twitter that he ""went through Finland's next steps towards Nato membership"" on the call. It comes a day after NiinistÃ¶ and Finland's PM Sanna Marin called for the historically neutral country to apply for Nato membership ""without delay"". Sweden will announce its own decision on joining Nato on Sunday. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

As we reported on Thursday, a US lawmaker has single-handedly blocked a multi billion-dollar aid package to Ukraine from passing this week. President Joe Biden had called on Congress to send the bill - $39.8bn in economic, humanitarian and security assistance - to his desk by the end of the week, but Senator Rand Paul blocked an expedited vote on Thursday evening alleging that the government was ""shuffling money out the door as fast as they can"" with no oversight. ""My oath of office is to the US Constitution, not to any foreign nation,"" Paul said on the Senate floor defending his decision. ""We cannot save Ukraine by dooming the US economy."" The senator from Kentucky is calling for a watchdog provision in the bill to oversee how the money is being spent, an amendment that would require further delays in the bill's passage. Congressional leaders have chided the congressman for causing the delay, as the current bill has enough votes to pass in the Senate through regular order but this will now not happen until next week. Paul's defiance has been lauded in some corners, with former president Donald Trump's son arguing lawmakers in Washington - or ""the swamp"" as he called them - ""don't want transparency"".

Sweden and Finland have said that they will hold talks with the Turkish government after its president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, said he was not in favour of their plans to join Nato. The Swedish and Finnish foreign ministers, Ann Linde and Pekka Haavisto said they would speak to their Turkish counterpart, Mevlut Cavusoglu, about the issue at a Nato meeting on Saturday. Erdogan said that Nordic countries had given asylum to people Turkey considers to be Kurdish terrorists. He added that he did not want Nato to repeat what he called the mistake of the past when it allowed Greece to join. Responding to Turkey's comments, the US said Turkey ""is a valued Nato ally"" and ""they've been involved and helpful in trying to get a dialogue going here, between Russia and Ukraine"". John Kirby, press secretary for the US Ministry of Defence, added ""we're working to better clarify the [Turkey's] position here"". Law enforcement officers in Ukraine are investigating 41 Russian servicemen suspected of having committed war crimes in the country, Interfax-Ukraine news agency reports. Prosecutor-General Iryna Venediktova said the suspects will be investigated for a range of crimes - from the bombing of civilian infrastructure, killing of civilians, rape and looting. The suspects will answer before a Ukrainian court of law, she added. Today, a Russian soldier accused of killing an unarmed 62-year-old civilian appeared in court in Kyiv. Vadim Shishimarin, 21, was brought to court for a preliminary hearing. He faces possible life imprisonment on charges of war crimes and premeditated murder. During a televised address on Friday evening, Venediktova said preliminary hearings on two more suspects will be carried out next week. The leader of breakaway region South Ossetia has announced a referendum on whether to become a part of Russia. A statement from the office of Anatoly Bibilov said it was his people's ""historic aspiration"" to come together with Russia, and the vote would take place on 17 July. Moscow recognises the region as independent, after a brief war between Russia and Georgia in 2008, and has provided financial support, Russian citizenship for its citizens and sited military bases there. Georgia maintains that South Ossetia is an occupied territory and previously said that a referendum on joining Russia would be unacceptable. Negotiations with Russia over freeing the Ukrainian fighters under siege in the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol were ""very difficult"", Ukraine's deputy prime minister has said. In an online post, Iryna
Vereshchuk wrote: ""The result may not be to everyone's liking, but our task is
to evacuate our boys. All of them. ""Alive."" Yesterday, the Ukrainian government said that it was pushing for safe passage for 38 badly wounded fighters, in exchange for captured Russians. The Azovstal complex once sheltered hundreds of civilians and fighters, but after several weeks trapped underground civilians were freed in a series of humanitarian convoys last week and negotiations over the fighters began. The Russian air force has attacked an arms depot in the Kharkiv region in Ukraine, state news agency RIA reports. The news agency quoted the Russian defence ministry saying it had hit the facility on Friday. Meanwhile, eyewitnesses to an earlier attack in Kharkiv told news agency AFP that they had been targeted by a Russian tank as they tried to seek shelter at home. ""Four people died, two were injured. My daughter died from a shrapnel wound in the back of her head,"" Olga Karpenko, 52, said. The BBC has not been able to independently verify this information. Sergei Shoigu (pictured) spoke with his US counterpart for an hour More details have emerged of the telephone call between US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin and Russia's Defence Minister Sergei Shoygu, in which General Austin called for an immediate ceasefire. Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said that Gen Austin had stressed the importance of maintaining communication, after Moscow had appeared uninterested in speaking to the US on previous attempts to hold the conversation. An anonymous US official said the tone of the hour-long call was ""professional"", but did not resolve any specific issues or lead to changes in Russian policy, news agency Reuters report. Russia's defence ministry confirmed that the US had initiated the call, and discussed ""topical issues of international security... including the situation in Ukraine"". Olga IvshinaSenior correspondent, BBC News Russian Since the start of the war, our team has been following and verifying reports of losses among Russian troops fighting in Ukraine by following official announcements, local media reports as well as social media and speaking to the relatives of Russian servicemen. Up to this moment BBC News Russian has been able to verify the deaths of 2,336 Russian servicemen. We have been able to establish their names, ranks and military units where they served. This is nearly twice the latest official figure released by the Russian Defence Ministry in March. It is likely that the real figure of the Russian military in Ukraine is far higher than we have been able to establish. But our data analysis helps to see the trends of what is happening with the Russian army fighting in Ukraine. Nearly 20% of all confirmed military casualties are officers. This proportion has remained unchanged for the past three months. Experts say that Russian officers may have to risk more on the frontline because of persistent problems with communications. Over 25% of all losses are paratroopers and marines. These units are often used in reconnaissance and storming operations. However they often donât get enough operational support and evacuation opportunities for the wounded. Most of the casualties, confirmed by us, came from the least developed and economically deprived regions of Russia. There are only three confirmed deaths of servicemen from Moscow, even though the capital makes up almost 9% of the Russian population. Ukrainian authorities now say that nearly 27,000 Russian soldiers have been killed. Read the full story on the BBC's Russian service here. As we've been reporting, Ukraine's Defence Minister Oleksiy Reznikov has said the country is entering a new stage of the war. Reznikov pledged to arm a million fighters using the new weapons and military equipment the US and other Western countries have been donating to the country over the last couple of weeks. The defence minister said that during the beginning of the war, ""volunteers were extremely helpful"" and it's thanks to their mobility that they ""quickly resolved highly pressing issues"". Reznikov said that to win, Ukraine ""must plan resources carefully and avoid mistakes"" and was investing in Ukrainian production facilities to ""ensure the stability and frequency of deliveries"". In his statement on Facebook, he said that Ukraine had relied on charitable aid from citizens, volunteers, and civic organisations for a significant proportion of its military equipment. He said that at the end of April, Ukraine's ministry of defence was relying on donations for 50% of the bullet proof vests used in combat. But as of 13 May, Ukraine has managed to increase its production to provide 57% of the armed forces' bullet proof vests, he added. More now on the suspension of electricity exports from Russia to Finland, which followed rising tensions over Helsinki's announcement of its plan to join Nato. RAO Nordic, a subsidiary of the Russian company Inter RAO, said non-payment was behind its decision to halt electrity supplies. The company said they had not received funds since 6 May and described the situation as ""exceptional"", adding that it is the first time it's happened ""in over 20 years of our trading history"". It did not specify whether this was due to the impact of sanctions but added, ""we hope that the situation will get improved soon and the electricity trade with Russia could resume"". Meanwhlle, the Finnish grid operator Fingrid said it did not anticpate any problems with supply as a result of the suspension. It said it would make up the shortfall by generating more power domestically and increasing imports from Sweden. This video can not be played Scenes of devastation as 'Russian battalion destroyed' If you're just joining us, here's a little recap of the latest events in Ukraine to bring you up to speed. Russian bridge-building foiled  Beyond the Donbas region  In diplomacy Ukraine's defence minister has said he hopes to arm a million fighters as the country prepares for a ""new, long phase of war"". Oleksiy Reznikov noted in a Facebook post that Ukraine would ""need to meticulously plan resources"" and ""avoid mistakes"" in order to win the war. Already, he said, Russia had suffered a ""strategic defeat"". The arrival of foreign weapons and ""stimulating Ukrainian producers"" would help further tip the balance against Russia, he continued. But before that, Ukraine was ""facing extremely difficult weeks ahead"". ""Nobody can tell how many. In that period, we will hold the defence primarily with our own resources against the enemy mad with rage,"" he predicted, in comments translated by our colleagues at BBC Monitoring. ""Increasing pressure of sanctions against Russia and increasing foreign assistance to Ukraine should create, within several months, the conditions under which the Kremlin will finally lose all chances to achieve any success. Then a new window of opportunity will appear for Ukraine. In this extremely hard period, we need unity, cohesion, will and patience,"" he concluded. Electricity exports from Russia to Finland are being suspended from 01:00 local time (22:00 GMT) on Saturday. Finnish grid operator Fingrid said Russian utility Inter RAO was stopping supplies due to ""problems in receiving payments for electricity sold on the market"". The announcement comes the day after Finland signalled its intention to join Nato. Finland only buys 10% of its electricity from Russia, and according to Fingrid it will make up the shortfall by sourcing more power from Sweden, and increasing generation in Finland. Finland expects to become self-sufficient in electrical energy in 2023, the company added. Sophie WilliamsBBC News, Lviv Ukraine says it's thwarted Russian attempts to create a key bridging point A Ukrainian military analyst admits that constant attacks
from Moscow mean the Ukrainians are on the back foot around the Siversky Donets
river â even though theyâve managed to thwart Russian attempts to put down
bridges near Severodonetsk. âThe advantage is now on the side of the Russian Federation,â
Oleh Zhdanov tells the BBC. âWe still can't bring down Russia's offensive pace.â Zhdanov says itâs âvery importantâ that his
side keeps control of this part of the Siversky Donets. Gaining the area would allow the Russians to make a
bridgehead and advance in the direction of the riverâs estuary, Zhdanov explains.
This would let them encircle the key city of Severodonetsk more fully as they
attempt to cut off Ukraineâs whole eastern Donbas region. The order for soldiers to gain this territory came
from the very top, Zhdanov adds. âThey are advancing so hard because it is a
political task, because Putin has ordered it,â he says. As weâve been reporting today, UK
defence intelligence says a Russian battalion lost almost all its armoured
vehicles during failed attempts to establish bridges across the river. Russia
has not commented. Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoygu and his US counterpart Lloyd Austin have spoken for the first time since 18 February - before Russia invaded Ukraine. According to a statement issued by the Pentagon, Austin urged an immediate ceasefire in Ukraine and used the call to emphasise the importance of maintaining lines of communication. On Wednesday, Austin held talks with UK Defence Minister Ben Wallace. In a statement, Wallace said the two leaders pledged ""to continue to work with unity and resolve to provide
Ukraine with what it needs to defend itself against Russiaâs
unprovoked invasion"". Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Ministers pledge votes on neighbours' extensionsBut an overhaul of planning rules scraps controversial rules making it harder to block development.,"This video can not be played Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove casts doubt on 300,000 homes target Neighbours could be allowed to vote on whether planning permission should be given for developments - such as house extensions - on their street. The ""street votes"" would be an alternative to traditional forms of planning permission. It comes as Michael Gove ditched most of the government's reforms of the planning system in England. Downing Street insisted it was still committed to building 300,000 homes a year by the mid-2020s. Mr Gove earlier told BBC Radio 4's Today programme more homes were needed. But, he added, hitting a ""statistical target"" was not the only measure of success, particularly ""if the homes that are built are shoddy, in the wrong place, don't have the infrastructure required, and are not contributing to beautiful communities"". Is the government meeting its new-homes target? The 300,000 target was a key Conservative pledge at the 2019 general election. Mr Gove's predecessor as Communities Secretary, Robert Jenrick, aimed to meet it by forcing councils to accept new housing developments in designated areas. But the plans sparked a significant Tory backlash,including from former Prime Minister Theresa May, who called them ""ill-conceived"". Some in the party said the policy had contributed to by-election losses in former Conservative heartlands - includingChesham and Amersham- fears that would only have been exacerbated bylast week's local elections results. Now Mr Jenrick's proposals will be dropped in favour of a new Levelling Up and Regeneration Bill,published on Wednesday,external. Other new policies will include: Design codes to let local communities set rules about the layout of new developments and materials which could be used A new infrastructure levy - to be determined locally - to increase funds for projects such as schools, hospitals and roads, by basing the sum on the value of the property when it is sold, rather than when it gets planning permission Digitising the planning system, making plans more accessible online rather than relying on notices on lampposts Labour's shadow levelling up secretary Lisa Nandy said: ""Under the Conservatives housing has become less affordable, spending on rent has sky-rocketed, and homeownership has gone down."" She said the party could ""no longer claim to be the party of homeownership"". Planning reforms paused amid Tory MP anger Why do ministers face a backlash on planning rules? Archaeologists dig in over planning reforms row Michael Gove was confronted by fury inside his own party over planning reforms put forward by his predecessor. So he's junked them. Instead, there's a set of measures designed to give people more say over development in their areas. Mr Gove has suggested communities will be more open to new housing if it's not imposed on them - if it's ""beautiful"" and ""democratic"". But having ditched more radical reforms, the government may well struggle to meet its own target for building new homes. All the while, there are tens of thousands of people on housing waiting lists, families living in unsuitable or temporary accommodation, and many others unable to afford to get on the property ladder. There are other measures in the Queen's Speech designed to improve the housing market - giving renters more protection and suggestions of a clampdown on empty second homes. It's a complex problem of which the planning system is only one part. But the reality is that the country is facing a housing crisis, and so far successive governments have failed to find a solution. In Boris Johnson's first year in office, only 243,000 new homes were supplied,according to the House of Commons Library,external- falling to 216,000 in 2020/21, partly because of the disruption caused by the pandemic. Research conducted by the BBC in 2020found the difference between the housing stock in England and the number of homes needed was more than one million. Robert Jenrick told MPs the government was likely to continue missing its target by a ""country mile"" without more action. The Conservatives pledged to build 300,000 homes a year in England by the mid-2020s as part of its 2019 manifesto Mr Gove said communities had been ""understandably resistant"" to new developments when factors like the appearance of the buildings and the supporting infrastructure - like GP surgeries and schools - were not included in the plans. But he believed more people would be in favour of new housing under his proposals, adding: ""It shouldn't be a case that we impose. It is important that even as we seek to improve housing supply, we also seek to build communities that people love and are proud of."" Labour MP Clive Betts - who chairs the housing select committee - called the ""street vote"" plan a gimmick, telling the BBC it was not possible for communities to ""decide absolutely everything"" about urban planning in their area. He told the BBC the process of building new housing should be simplified, with local people involved in decisions about where homes might be placed much earlier than at the planning permission stage. Before proposals can be put to a local vote, they will be examined against a set of nationally prescribed development rules, which are to be agreed in due course, the government said. Development will go ahead only if the proposal is endorsed by a ""supermajority"" of residents in a referendum. The precise thresholds for approval would be set out in regulations in due course, the government added. Around 340,000 new homes are needed in England each year - 145,000 of them should be affordable, research for the National Housing Federation in 2019 said In 2020, the Affordable Housing Commission found that more than half of 18 to 24 year-olds still lived with family members; 18% continuing to do so when aged 25 to 34 From 2010 to 2020, more than 464,000 affordable homes were built; 114,000 of these were social homes (housing provided for people on low incomes or with particular needs) In England, an average house cost Â£292,000 (March 2022, ONS) The latest official figure for median monthly rent (for 2021) was Â£755, the highest ever recorded Are you struggling to get on the housing ladder?

We're closing our live coverage of the war in Ukraine for today in a little while. We'll leave you with a brief recap of what's happened: Fighting in the east  Beyond the Donbas region  In diplomacy  You can read about more of the day's key events here. Ukraine has said it is returning the bodies of fallen Russian troops back home. On Friday, military officials were seen loading and stacking bodies collected from the Kyiv and Chernihiv regions onto refrigerated rail cars. The move is in accordance with ""the norms of international humanitarian law"", according to Volodymyr Lyamzin, the head of Ukraine's civil-military cooperation. ""After the active phase of the conflict is over, sides have to return the bodies of the military of another country. Ukraine is ready to return the bodies to the aggressor,â Lyamzin told the Reuters news agency. Several refrigerated trains have reportedly been stationed in other parts of the country as well. Ukraine claims it has killed some 20,000 Russian troops. Russia has not updated its death toll since 25 March, when it acknowledged 1,351 deaths. TheBBC Ukrainian serviceis reporting that the Ukrainian army has released two decks of cards depicting Russians they suspect of war crimes. The idea replicates the set of55 playing cardsthat the US military produced in the 2003 invasion of Iraq, depicting what it said were the most wanted members of Saddam Hussein's government. Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Valerii Zaluzhnyi, said the cards were produced with the help of volunteers from the international intelligence community InformNapalm. US President Joe Biden has spoken with the leaders of Finland and Sweden about their plans to join the Nato alliance. The White House said Biden had held a joint phone call with Finnish President Sauli NiinistÃ¶ and Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson about the issue on Friday. A readout of the call claims the trio discussed Natoâs Open Door policy and ""the right of Finland and Sweden to decide their own future, foreign policy, and security arrangements"". Afterwards, NiinistÃ¶ wrote on Twitter that he ""went through Finland's next steps towards Nato membership"" on the call. It comes a day after NiinistÃ¶ and Finland's PM Sanna Marin called for the historically neutral country to apply for Nato membership ""without delay"". Sweden will announce its own decision on joining Nato on Sunday. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

As we reported on Thursday, a US lawmaker has single-handedly blocked a multi billion-dollar aid package to Ukraine from passing this week. President Joe Biden had called on Congress to send the bill - $39.8bn in economic, humanitarian and security assistance - to his desk by the end of the week, but Senator Rand Paul blocked an expedited vote on Thursday evening alleging that the government was ""shuffling money out the door as fast as they can"" with no oversight. ""My oath of office is to the US Constitution, not to any foreign nation,"" Paul said on the Senate floor defending his decision. ""We cannot save Ukraine by dooming the US economy."" The senator from Kentucky is calling for a watchdog provision in the bill to oversee how the money is being spent, an amendment that would require further delays in the bill's passage. Congressional leaders have chided the congressman for causing the delay, as the current bill has enough votes to pass in the Senate through regular order but this will now not happen until next week. Paul's defiance has been lauded in some corners, with former president Donald Trump's son arguing lawmakers in Washington - or ""the swamp"" as he called them - ""don't want transparency"".

Sweden and Finland have said that they will hold talks with the Turkish government after its president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, said he was not in favour of their plans to join Nato. The Swedish and Finnish foreign ministers, Ann Linde and Pekka Haavisto said they would speak to their Turkish counterpart, Mevlut Cavusoglu, about the issue at a Nato meeting on Saturday. Erdogan said that Nordic countries had given asylum to people Turkey considers to be Kurdish terrorists. He added that he did not want Nato to repeat what he called the mistake of the past when it allowed Greece to join. Responding to Turkey's comments, the US said Turkey ""is a valued Nato ally"" and ""they've been involved and helpful in trying to get a dialogue going here, between Russia and Ukraine"". John Kirby, press secretary for the US Ministry of Defence, added ""we're working to better clarify the [Turkey's] position here"". Law enforcement officers in Ukraine are investigating 41 Russian servicemen suspected of having committed war crimes in the country, Interfax-Ukraine news agency reports. Prosecutor-General Iryna Venediktova said the suspects will be investigated for a range of crimes - from the bombing of civilian infrastructure, killing of civilians, rape and looting. The suspects will answer before a Ukrainian court of law, she added. Today, a Russian soldier accused of killing an unarmed 62-year-old civilian appeared in court in Kyiv. Vadim Shishimarin, 21, was brought to court for a preliminary hearing. He faces possible life imprisonment on charges of war crimes and premeditated murder. During a televised address on Friday evening, Venediktova said preliminary hearings on two more suspects will be carried out next week. The leader of breakaway region South Ossetia has announced a referendum on whether to become a part of Russia. A statement from the office of Anatoly Bibilov said it was his people's ""historic aspiration"" to come together with Russia, and the vote would take place on 17 July. Moscow recognises the region as independent, after a brief war between Russia and Georgia in 2008, and has provided financial support, Russian citizenship for its citizens and sited military bases there. Georgia maintains that South Ossetia is an occupied territory and previously said that a referendum on joining Russia would be unacceptable. Negotiations with Russia over freeing the Ukrainian fighters under siege in the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol were ""very difficult"", Ukraine's deputy prime minister has said. In an online post, Iryna
Vereshchuk wrote: ""The result may not be to everyone's liking, but our task is
to evacuate our boys. All of them. ""Alive."" Yesterday, the Ukrainian government said that it was pushing for safe passage for 38 badly wounded fighters, in exchange for captured Russians. The Azovstal complex once sheltered hundreds of civilians and fighters, but after several weeks trapped underground civilians were freed in a series of humanitarian convoys last week and negotiations over the fighters began. The Russian air force has attacked an arms depot in the Kharkiv region in Ukraine, state news agency RIA reports. The news agency quoted the Russian defence ministry saying it had hit the facility on Friday. Meanwhile, eyewitnesses to an earlier attack in Kharkiv told news agency AFP that they had been targeted by a Russian tank as they tried to seek shelter at home. ""Four people died, two were injured. My daughter died from a shrapnel wound in the back of her head,"" Olga Karpenko, 52, said. The BBC has not been able to independently verify this information. Sergei Shoigu (pictured) spoke with his US counterpart for an hour More details have emerged of the telephone call between US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin and Russia's Defence Minister Sergei Shoygu, in which General Austin called for an immediate ceasefire. Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said that Gen Austin had stressed the importance of maintaining communication, after Moscow had appeared uninterested in speaking to the US on previous attempts to hold the conversation. An anonymous US official said the tone of the hour-long call was ""professional"", but did not resolve any specific issues or lead to changes in Russian policy, news agency Reuters report. Russia's defence ministry confirmed that the US had initiated the call, and discussed ""topical issues of international security... including the situation in Ukraine"". Olga IvshinaSenior correspondent, BBC News Russian Since the start of the war, our team has been following and verifying reports of losses among Russian troops fighting in Ukraine by following official announcements, local media reports as well as social media and speaking to the relatives of Russian servicemen. Up to this moment BBC News Russian has been able to verify the deaths of 2,336 Russian servicemen. We have been able to establish their names, ranks and military units where they served. This is nearly twice the latest official figure released by the Russian Defence Ministry in March. It is likely that the real figure of the Russian military in Ukraine is far higher than we have been able to establish. But our data analysis helps to see the trends of what is happening with the Russian army fighting in Ukraine. Nearly 20% of all confirmed military casualties are officers. This proportion has remained unchanged for the past three months. Experts say that Russian officers may have to risk more on the frontline because of persistent problems with communications. Over 25% of all losses are paratroopers and marines. These units are often used in reconnaissance and storming operations. However they often donât get enough operational support and evacuation opportunities for the wounded. Most of the casualties, confirmed by us, came from the least developed and economically deprived regions of Russia. There are only three confirmed deaths of servicemen from Moscow, even though the capital makes up almost 9% of the Russian population. Ukrainian authorities now say that nearly 27,000 Russian soldiers have been killed. Read the full story on the BBC's Russian service here. As we've been reporting, Ukraine's Defence Minister Oleksiy Reznikov has said the country is entering a new stage of the war. Reznikov pledged to arm a million fighters using the new weapons and military equipment the US and other Western countries have been donating to the country over the last couple of weeks. The defence minister said that during the beginning of the war, ""volunteers were extremely helpful"" and it's thanks to their mobility that they ""quickly resolved highly pressing issues"". Reznikov said that to win, Ukraine ""must plan resources carefully and avoid mistakes"" and was investing in Ukrainian production facilities to ""ensure the stability and frequency of deliveries"". In his statement on Facebook, he said that Ukraine had relied on charitable aid from citizens, volunteers, and civic organisations for a significant proportion of its military equipment. He said that at the end of April, Ukraine's ministry of defence was relying on donations for 50% of the bullet proof vests used in combat. But as of 13 May, Ukraine has managed to increase its production to provide 57% of the armed forces' bullet proof vests, he added. More now on the suspension of electricity exports from Russia to Finland, which followed rising tensions over Helsinki's announcement of its plan to join Nato. RAO Nordic, a subsidiary of the Russian company Inter RAO, said non-payment was behind its decision to halt electrity supplies. The company said they had not received funds since 6 May and described the situation as ""exceptional"", adding that it is the first time it's happened ""in over 20 years of our trading history"". It did not specify whether this was due to the impact of sanctions but added, ""we hope that the situation will get improved soon and the electricity trade with Russia could resume"". Meanwhlle, the Finnish grid operator Fingrid said it did not anticpate any problems with supply as a result of the suspension. It said it would make up the shortfall by generating more power domestically and increasing imports from Sweden. This video can not be played Scenes of devastation as 'Russian battalion destroyed' If you're just joining us, here's a little recap of the latest events in Ukraine to bring you up to speed. Russian bridge-building foiled  Beyond the Donbas region  In diplomacy Ukraine's defence minister has said he hopes to arm a million fighters as the country prepares for a ""new, long phase of war"". Oleksiy Reznikov noted in a Facebook post that Ukraine would ""need to meticulously plan resources"" and ""avoid mistakes"" in order to win the war. Already, he said, Russia had suffered a ""strategic defeat"". The arrival of foreign weapons and ""stimulating Ukrainian producers"" would help further tip the balance against Russia, he continued. But before that, Ukraine was ""facing extremely difficult weeks ahead"". ""Nobody can tell how many. In that period, we will hold the defence primarily with our own resources against the enemy mad with rage,"" he predicted, in comments translated by our colleagues at BBC Monitoring. ""Increasing pressure of sanctions against Russia and increasing foreign assistance to Ukraine should create, within several months, the conditions under which the Kremlin will finally lose all chances to achieve any success. Then a new window of opportunity will appear for Ukraine. In this extremely hard period, we need unity, cohesion, will and patience,"" he concluded. Electricity exports from Russia to Finland are being suspended from 01:00 local time (22:00 GMT) on Saturday. Finnish grid operator Fingrid said Russian utility Inter RAO was stopping supplies due to ""problems in receiving payments for electricity sold on the market"". The announcement comes the day after Finland signalled its intention to join Nato. Finland only buys 10% of its electricity from Russia, and according to Fingrid it will make up the shortfall by sourcing more power from Sweden, and increasing generation in Finland. Finland expects to become self-sufficient in electrical energy in 2023, the company added. Sophie WilliamsBBC News, Lviv Ukraine says it's thwarted Russian attempts to create a key bridging point A Ukrainian military analyst admits that constant attacks
from Moscow mean the Ukrainians are on the back foot around the Siversky Donets
river â even though theyâve managed to thwart Russian attempts to put down
bridges near Severodonetsk. âThe advantage is now on the side of the Russian Federation,â
Oleh Zhdanov tells the BBC. âWe still can't bring down Russia's offensive pace.â Zhdanov says itâs âvery importantâ that his
side keeps control of this part of the Siversky Donets. Gaining the area would allow the Russians to make a
bridgehead and advance in the direction of the riverâs estuary, Zhdanov explains.
This would let them encircle the key city of Severodonetsk more fully as they
attempt to cut off Ukraineâs whole eastern Donbas region. The order for soldiers to gain this territory came
from the very top, Zhdanov adds. âThey are advancing so hard because it is a
political task, because Putin has ordered it,â he says. As weâve been reporting today, UK
defence intelligence says a Russian battalion lost almost all its armoured
vehicles during failed attempts to establish bridges across the river. Russia
has not commented. Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoygu and his US counterpart Lloyd Austin have spoken for the first time since 18 February - before Russia invaded Ukraine. According to a statement issued by the Pentagon, Austin urged an immediate ceasefire in Ukraine and used the call to emphasise the importance of maintaining lines of communication. On Wednesday, Austin held talks with UK Defence Minister Ben Wallace. In a statement, Wallace said the two leaders pledged ""to continue to work with unity and resolve to provide
Ukraine with what it needs to defend itself against Russiaâs
unprovoked invasion"". Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
PM to hold Ukraine talks with Sweden and Finland,"Boris Johnson will visit Sweden and Finland to discuss the war in Ukraine, amid debate within both nations about whether to join the Nato alliance. The prime minister is scheduled to meet leaders of both countries during a 24-hour trip on Wednesday. Mr Johnson is expected to discuss Europe's response to the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine. Mr Johnson's official spokesman said the visit was also about the ""security of Europe more broadly"". ""We understand the positions of Sweden and Finland and that is why the prime minister is going to discuss these broader security issues,"" he said. Asked whether the two countries' possible membership of the alliance would be discussed, the prime minister's spokesman said: ""We support democratic capabilities to decide on things like Nato membership."" Mr Johnson will give a news conference in each country, travelling to Sweden first before going on to Finland and then returning to the UK. Are Finland and Sweden going from neutral to Nato? What is Nato and could Finland and Sweden join? Is Nato's Nordic expansion a threat or boost to Europe? Nato - the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation - is a 30-nation defensive alliance founded shortly after the end of World War Two. It has its headquarters in Brussels, but is dominated by the massive military and nuclear missile power of the US. Support for joining Nato has increased in both both Sweden and Finland since Russia invaded Ukraine, despite their long history of pursuing policies of military neutrality to avoid conflict with regional powers. Finland and Sweden are both modern, democratic countries that fulfil the criteria for membership. Nato's chief, secretary general Jens Stoltenberg, has said the alliance would welcome them with open arms and there would be minimum delay in processing their membership. Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin (R) met Swedish leader Magdalena Andersson in Stockholm to discuss Nato in mid-April During a visit to Sweden in April, Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin said ""everything had changed"" when Russia invaded Ukraine and told reporters Finland must to be ""prepared for all kinds of actions from Russia"". Her comments coincided with thepublication of a security reportthat warned membership of Nato could result in ""increased tensions on the border between Finland and Russia"". At the same time, Ms Marin's Swedish counterpart Magdalena Andersson told reporters that the same ""very serious analysis"" was taking place as in Finland and she saw no point in delaying it. Finland for decades, and Sweden for centuries, have chosen to adopt a kind of neutral status rather than enter any military alliance. But Russia's invasion of Ukraine has transformed public opinion in both countries. People seem now to want the protection that Nato membership can provide. But neither country would get the alliance's security guarantee - that an attack on one member is an attack on all - until their application has been accepted. That could take some months. Until that point, there is a moment of vulnerability. So what will be interesting is to see what kind of support the UK - and other countries - might be prepared to provide Sweden and Finland in the meantime, during that so-called ""grey zone"" between both countries' application and accession to the Western military alliance. Finnish Foreign Minister Pekka Haavisto subsequently said it would be ""useful"" for Sweden and Finland to launch joint Nato membership bids, but added no fixed date had been set for any potential application. However, Russia has warned them not to and threatened ""a military technical response"" if they do try to join. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov stressed that Moscow would have to ""rebalance the situation"" with its own measures if any bid went ahead. In a speech last month, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said they should be admitted ""as soon as possible"" if they decided to apply for membership. Mr Johnson held talks with Ms Andersson and Finnish president Sauli Niinisto in March as part of a meeting of the Joint Expeditionary Force nations, which includes Denmark, Estonia, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands and Norway. After the meeting, No 10 said the leaders had all agreed the invasion of Ukraine had ""dramatically changed the landscape of European security"". Finland shares a land border of 830 miles (1,340km) with Russia and is only about 250 miles from St Petersburg.

"Food and energy bills warning for 1.5m householdsRising prices and higher taxes are squeezing Britons' budgets, according to researchers.Business","Faith Angwet told the BBC there was no support to help her pay rising food and energy bills Single mum Faith Angwet struggled to make ends meet during the pandemic but says the cost of living crisis has hit her even harder. ""I was starting to feel like I was getting to a good place but now the price of everything has gone up it has pushed me right back,"" she said. Ms Angwet is one of an estimated 1.5m UK households that will struggle to pay food and energy bills in the next year. That's according to research which also predicts a UK recession in 2022. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) has also warned that a combination of rising prices andmeasures announced in the Chancellor's Spring Statement- such as the decision not to scrap a planned rise in National Insurance tax - are hitting the poorest households hardest. Ms Angwet, 36, from Southwark in south London, is a single mother-of-two who has been unemployed since having her daughter two years ago. ""In the pandemic if you couldn't afford something you could shop around or buy in bulk. But now you can't afford it everywhere. And if I am able to buy in bulk, if the kids see it they want to eat it now. So I find myself hiding things from them so I can bring it out another day like magic."" Faith Angwet said plans to take her children to the beach would have to be pushed back due to rising costs Things have got so bad that Ms Angwet sometimes forgoes her prescription for blood pressure medication so she can afford to buy formula and nappies for her daughter. As she is unemployed, she cannot get any other form of benefit or financial help from the government so has turned to food banks for support. She said her five-year-old son's free school meals were a ""huge help"" and that she was grateful for nappies and clothes from Little Village baby bank. ""It's got to the point that I turned to a payday loan, but they want you to borrow more than you need. We can't always go to the food bank, it's a vicious cycle,"" she said. Why are prices rising so quickly? Warning of economic downturn as interest rates rise Five ways the Ukraine war could push up prices Inflation - the rate at which prices rise - is at a 30-year high, as the Ukraine war drives up fuel and energy prices. The Bank of England has warned inflation might reach 10% within months. The think tank urged the government to raise Universal Credit by Â£25 per week between May and October, which would cost around Â£1.35bn, and give Â£250 each to 11.3 million lower income households. ""Without this targeted support we expect a further increase in extreme poverty,"" the think tank said, with about a quarter of a million households sliding into extreme poverty, taking the number to about a million. About half a million households would ""face the choice between eating and heating"" without these payments, it said, adding that the chancellor had a reported Â£20bn of ""headroom"" for government spending that could be used to cushion the shock to income. The think tank predicted that inflation would average 7.8% in 2022 and will remain above 3% until 2024 - above the Bank of England's 2% target. At the same time, economic growth is set to slow. While NIESR forecast that UK economic growth in 2022 would increase by 3.5% on average, it predicted a fall in the final two quarters of the year. This would push the UK into a recession, which is two consecutive quarters of economic decline. Meanwhile, government policies are set to leave households with even less disposable income, according to NIESR. It forecasts household income when adjusted for inflation will fall by 2.4% in 2022, along with a small rise in unemployment next year. Tony Danker, director general of the CBI, which represents big businesses, told the BBC's Today programme that companies were suffering too. He said inflation, higher energy prices, labour shortages and the war in Ukraine had made firms ""pause before investing"", and that this was stopping them ""creating jobs and paying good wages"". He said the government needed to create ""reasons to invest"" such as subsidising the shift to clean energy or cutting business rates for shops. ""If we wait... the economy will end up in more trouble,"" he added. ""Get firms investing now because that will stop us facing dire consequences later on."" Fears as energy hike hits disabled families Money tips: How to cut spending as energy bills rise Professor Stephen Millard, NIESR's deputy director for macroeconomics, said: ""Although the war in Ukraine is fundamentally a human tragedy, it has resulted in another supply shock for the UK economy: pushing down growth and pushing up on inflation."" He added: ""We need fiscal policy to loosen and monetary policy to tighten if the UK economy is going to sail safely through these treacherous seas."" A Treasury spokesperson said the country has had a ""strong economic recovery"" from the pandemic but acknowledged that these are ""anxious times"", and said the government is taking action to support households. ""This includes a tax cut of over Â£330 a year for the typical employee, lowering the Universal Credit taper rate to help people keep more of the money they earn, and providing millions of households with up to Â£350 each to help with rising energy bills,"" the spokesperson said. ""Public debt is at the highest levels since the 1960s and rising inflation is pushing up our debt interest costs, which means we must manage public finances sustainably to avoid saddling future generations with further debt."" Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said the government should bring in an emergency budget ""urgently"", adding: ""With a one-off windfall tax on oil and gas producer profits we can cut household bills by up to Â£600 and support businesses through the cost of living storm."" It comes as NIESR separately forecast that global economic growth would be 1% lower, or about $1.5tn, at the end of 2022, due to the Ukraine war.

Pub talk could be key to banker's doorstep murderPolice seek information on what was said about a planning row Alistair Wilson was involved in.Highlands & Islands,"Alistair Wilson was shot on the doorstep of his family home almost 18 years ago Conversations in a pub in the days leading up to the murder of a father-of-two could be significant in solving the case, police have said. Bank manager Alistair Wilson was shot on the doorstep of his home in Nairn in 2004. He later died in hospital. Mr Wilson had objected to a large decking area outside the Havelock Hotel opposite his house shortly before he was shot. Detectives believe his objection was openly discussed in the hotel. Last month, Police Scotland's major investigation team saidit believed the planning dispute was the likely motive for the murder. Detectives said that two new witnesses had come forward with further information about the planning application and the building of the decking. Men seen on beach with gun before fatal shooting Police update description of gunman in 2004 murder Murdered banker's wife 'needs answers' The decking at the Havelock Hotel was built in the spring of 2004 without the required planning consent. It was the subject of a retrospective planning application at the time of the murder. Decking at the Havelock Hotel (pictured in 2008) was built in 2004 without the required planning consent Mr Wilson lodged a written objection with Highland Council, and police said a copy of the letter was sent to the hotel on Friday - two days before the shooting. Det Supt Graeme Mackie said: ""We understand through our inquiries that Alistair's objection was openly talked about in the Havelock Hotel bar from Friday 26 November up until his murder on Sunday 28 November, and would urge anyone who was present over this period, or knows who was there, to please come forward and speak to us. ""We want to know what was being said about it and who else was there as this may be significant to our investigation. ""I would ask anyone with information, no matter how insignificant they think it might be, to please come forward."" Why did an evening end in gunshots? BBC Sounds: The Doorstep Murder On the evening of the shooting, Mr Wilson's wife Veronica answered the door to a stocky man wearing a baseball cap who asked for her husband by name. Mr Wilson, who had been reading to his two sons, went downstairs to speak to the man and was handed an empty blue envelope with the name Paul on it. Mr Wilson went inside briefly and then returned to the door for a second time when he was shot.

We're closing our live coverage of the war in Ukraine for today in a little while. We'll leave you with a brief recap of what's happened: Fighting in the east  Beyond the Donbas region  In diplomacy  You can read about more of the day's key events here. Ukraine has said it is returning the bodies of fallen Russian troops back home. On Friday, military officials were seen loading and stacking bodies collected from the Kyiv and Chernihiv regions onto refrigerated rail cars. The move is in accordance with ""the norms of international humanitarian law"", according to Volodymyr Lyamzin, the head of Ukraine's civil-military cooperation. ""After the active phase of the conflict is over, sides have to return the bodies of the military of another country. Ukraine is ready to return the bodies to the aggressor,â Lyamzin told the Reuters news agency. Several refrigerated trains have reportedly been stationed in other parts of the country as well. Ukraine claims it has killed some 20,000 Russian troops. Russia has not updated its death toll since 25 March, when it acknowledged 1,351 deaths. TheBBC Ukrainian serviceis reporting that the Ukrainian army has released two decks of cards depicting Russians they suspect of war crimes. The idea replicates the set of55 playing cardsthat the US military produced in the 2003 invasion of Iraq, depicting what it said were the most wanted members of Saddam Hussein's government. Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Valerii Zaluzhnyi, said the cards were produced with the help of volunteers from the international intelligence community InformNapalm. US President Joe Biden has spoken with the leaders of Finland and Sweden about their plans to join the Nato alliance. The White House said Biden had held a joint phone call with Finnish President Sauli NiinistÃ¶ and Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson about the issue on Friday. A readout of the call claims the trio discussed Natoâs Open Door policy and ""the right of Finland and Sweden to decide their own future, foreign policy, and security arrangements"". Afterwards, NiinistÃ¶ wrote on Twitter that he ""went through Finland's next steps towards Nato membership"" on the call. It comes a day after NiinistÃ¶ and Finland's PM Sanna Marin called for the historically neutral country to apply for Nato membership ""without delay"". Sweden will announce its own decision on joining Nato on Sunday. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

As we reported on Thursday, a US lawmaker has single-handedly blocked a multi billion-dollar aid package to Ukraine from passing this week. President Joe Biden had called on Congress to send the bill - $39.8bn in economic, humanitarian and security assistance - to his desk by the end of the week, but Senator Rand Paul blocked an expedited vote on Thursday evening alleging that the government was ""shuffling money out the door as fast as they can"" with no oversight. ""My oath of office is to the US Constitution, not to any foreign nation,"" Paul said on the Senate floor defending his decision. ""We cannot save Ukraine by dooming the US economy."" The senator from Kentucky is calling for a watchdog provision in the bill to oversee how the money is being spent, an amendment that would require further delays in the bill's passage. Congressional leaders have chided the congressman for causing the delay, as the current bill has enough votes to pass in the Senate through regular order but this will now not happen until next week. Paul's defiance has been lauded in some corners, with former president Donald Trump's son arguing lawmakers in Washington - or ""the swamp"" as he called them - ""don't want transparency"".

Sweden and Finland have said that they will hold talks with the Turkish government after its president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, said he was not in favour of their plans to join Nato. The Swedish and Finnish foreign ministers, Ann Linde and Pekka Haavisto said they would speak to their Turkish counterpart, Mevlut Cavusoglu, about the issue at a Nato meeting on Saturday. Erdogan said that Nordic countries had given asylum to people Turkey considers to be Kurdish terrorists. He added that he did not want Nato to repeat what he called the mistake of the past when it allowed Greece to join. Responding to Turkey's comments, the US said Turkey ""is a valued Nato ally"" and ""they've been involved and helpful in trying to get a dialogue going here, between Russia and Ukraine"". John Kirby, press secretary for the US Ministry of Defence, added ""we're working to better clarify the [Turkey's] position here"". Law enforcement officers in Ukraine are investigating 41 Russian servicemen suspected of having committed war crimes in the country, Interfax-Ukraine news agency reports. Prosecutor-General Iryna Venediktova said the suspects will be investigated for a range of crimes - from the bombing of civilian infrastructure, killing of civilians, rape and looting. The suspects will answer before a Ukrainian court of law, she added. Today, a Russian soldier accused of killing an unarmed 62-year-old civilian appeared in court in Kyiv. Vadim Shishimarin, 21, was brought to court for a preliminary hearing. He faces possible life imprisonment on charges of war crimes and premeditated murder. During a televised address on Friday evening, Venediktova said preliminary hearings on two more suspects will be carried out next week. The leader of breakaway region South Ossetia has announced a referendum on whether to become a part of Russia. A statement from the office of Anatoly Bibilov said it was his people's ""historic aspiration"" to come together with Russia, and the vote would take place on 17 July. Moscow recognises the region as independent, after a brief war between Russia and Georgia in 2008, and has provided financial support, Russian citizenship for its citizens and sited military bases there. Georgia maintains that South Ossetia is an occupied territory and previously said that a referendum on joining Russia would be unacceptable. Negotiations with Russia over freeing the Ukrainian fighters under siege in the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol were ""very difficult"", Ukraine's deputy prime minister has said. In an online post, Iryna
Vereshchuk wrote: ""The result may not be to everyone's liking, but our task is
to evacuate our boys. All of them. ""Alive."" Yesterday, the Ukrainian government said that it was pushing for safe passage for 38 badly wounded fighters, in exchange for captured Russians. The Azovstal complex once sheltered hundreds of civilians and fighters, but after several weeks trapped underground civilians were freed in a series of humanitarian convoys last week and negotiations over the fighters began. The Russian air force has attacked an arms depot in the Kharkiv region in Ukraine, state news agency RIA reports. The news agency quoted the Russian defence ministry saying it had hit the facility on Friday. Meanwhile, eyewitnesses to an earlier attack in Kharkiv told news agency AFP that they had been targeted by a Russian tank as they tried to seek shelter at home. ""Four people died, two were injured. My daughter died from a shrapnel wound in the back of her head,"" Olga Karpenko, 52, said. The BBC has not been able to independently verify this information. Sergei Shoigu (pictured) spoke with his US counterpart for an hour More details have emerged of the telephone call between US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin and Russia's Defence Minister Sergei Shoygu, in which General Austin called for an immediate ceasefire. Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said that Gen Austin had stressed the importance of maintaining communication, after Moscow had appeared uninterested in speaking to the US on previous attempts to hold the conversation. An anonymous US official said the tone of the hour-long call was ""professional"", but did not resolve any specific issues or lead to changes in Russian policy, news agency Reuters report. Russia's defence ministry confirmed that the US had initiated the call, and discussed ""topical issues of international security... including the situation in Ukraine"". Olga IvshinaSenior correspondent, BBC News Russian Since the start of the war, our team has been following and verifying reports of losses among Russian troops fighting in Ukraine by following official announcements, local media reports as well as social media and speaking to the relatives of Russian servicemen. Up to this moment BBC News Russian has been able to verify the deaths of 2,336 Russian servicemen. We have been able to establish their names, ranks and military units where they served. This is nearly twice the latest official figure released by the Russian Defence Ministry in March. It is likely that the real figure of the Russian military in Ukraine is far higher than we have been able to establish. But our data analysis helps to see the trends of what is happening with the Russian army fighting in Ukraine. Nearly 20% of all confirmed military casualties are officers. This proportion has remained unchanged for the past three months. Experts say that Russian officers may have to risk more on the frontline because of persistent problems with communications. Over 25% of all losses are paratroopers and marines. These units are often used in reconnaissance and storming operations. However they often donât get enough operational support and evacuation opportunities for the wounded. Most of the casualties, confirmed by us, came from the least developed and economically deprived regions of Russia. There are only three confirmed deaths of servicemen from Moscow, even though the capital makes up almost 9% of the Russian population. Ukrainian authorities now say that nearly 27,000 Russian soldiers have been killed. Read the full story on the BBC's Russian service here. As we've been reporting, Ukraine's Defence Minister Oleksiy Reznikov has said the country is entering a new stage of the war. Reznikov pledged to arm a million fighters using the new weapons and military equipment the US and other Western countries have been donating to the country over the last couple of weeks. The defence minister said that during the beginning of the war, ""volunteers were extremely helpful"" and it's thanks to their mobility that they ""quickly resolved highly pressing issues"". Reznikov said that to win, Ukraine ""must plan resources carefully and avoid mistakes"" and was investing in Ukrainian production facilities to ""ensure the stability and frequency of deliveries"". In his statement on Facebook, he said that Ukraine had relied on charitable aid from citizens, volunteers, and civic organisations for a significant proportion of its military equipment. He said that at the end of April, Ukraine's ministry of defence was relying on donations for 50% of the bullet proof vests used in combat. But as of 13 May, Ukraine has managed to increase its production to provide 57% of the armed forces' bullet proof vests, he added. More now on the suspension of electricity exports from Russia to Finland, which followed rising tensions over Helsinki's announcement of its plan to join Nato. RAO Nordic, a subsidiary of the Russian company Inter RAO, said non-payment was behind its decision to halt electrity supplies. The company said they had not received funds since 6 May and described the situation as ""exceptional"", adding that it is the first time it's happened ""in over 20 years of our trading history"". It did not specify whether this was due to the impact of sanctions but added, ""we hope that the situation will get improved soon and the electricity trade with Russia could resume"". Meanwhlle, the Finnish grid operator Fingrid said it did not anticpate any problems with supply as a result of the suspension. It said it would make up the shortfall by generating more power domestically and increasing imports from Sweden. This video can not be played Scenes of devastation as 'Russian battalion destroyed' If you're just joining us, here's a little recap of the latest events in Ukraine to bring you up to speed. Russian bridge-building foiled  Beyond the Donbas region  In diplomacy Ukraine's defence minister has said he hopes to arm a million fighters as the country prepares for a ""new, long phase of war"". Oleksiy Reznikov noted in a Facebook post that Ukraine would ""need to meticulously plan resources"" and ""avoid mistakes"" in order to win the war. Already, he said, Russia had suffered a ""strategic defeat"". The arrival of foreign weapons and ""stimulating Ukrainian producers"" would help further tip the balance against Russia, he continued. But before that, Ukraine was ""facing extremely difficult weeks ahead"". ""Nobody can tell how many. In that period, we will hold the defence primarily with our own resources against the enemy mad with rage,"" he predicted, in comments translated by our colleagues at BBC Monitoring. ""Increasing pressure of sanctions against Russia and increasing foreign assistance to Ukraine should create, within several months, the conditions under which the Kremlin will finally lose all chances to achieve any success. Then a new window of opportunity will appear for Ukraine. In this extremely hard period, we need unity, cohesion, will and patience,"" he concluded. Electricity exports from Russia to Finland are being suspended from 01:00 local time (22:00 GMT) on Saturday. Finnish grid operator Fingrid said Russian utility Inter RAO was stopping supplies due to ""problems in receiving payments for electricity sold on the market"". The announcement comes the day after Finland signalled its intention to join Nato. Finland only buys 10% of its electricity from Russia, and according to Fingrid it will make up the shortfall by sourcing more power from Sweden, and increasing generation in Finland. Finland expects to become self-sufficient in electrical energy in 2023, the company added. Sophie WilliamsBBC News, Lviv Ukraine says it's thwarted Russian attempts to create a key bridging point A Ukrainian military analyst admits that constant attacks
from Moscow mean the Ukrainians are on the back foot around the Siversky Donets
river â even though theyâve managed to thwart Russian attempts to put down
bridges near Severodonetsk. âThe advantage is now on the side of the Russian Federation,â
Oleh Zhdanov tells the BBC. âWe still can't bring down Russia's offensive pace.â Zhdanov says itâs âvery importantâ that his
side keeps control of this part of the Siversky Donets. Gaining the area would allow the Russians to make a
bridgehead and advance in the direction of the riverâs estuary, Zhdanov explains.
This would let them encircle the key city of Severodonetsk more fully as they
attempt to cut off Ukraineâs whole eastern Donbas region. The order for soldiers to gain this territory came
from the very top, Zhdanov adds. âThey are advancing so hard because it is a
political task, because Putin has ordered it,â he says. As weâve been reporting today, UK
defence intelligence says a Russian battalion lost almost all its armoured
vehicles during failed attempts to establish bridges across the river. Russia
has not commented. Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoygu and his US counterpart Lloyd Austin have spoken for the first time since 18 February - before Russia invaded Ukraine. According to a statement issued by the Pentagon, Austin urged an immediate ceasefire in Ukraine and used the call to emphasise the importance of maintaining lines of communication. On Wednesday, Austin held talks with UK Defence Minister Ben Wallace. In a statement, Wallace said the two leaders pledged ""to continue to work with unity and resolve to provide
Ukraine with what it needs to defend itself against Russiaâs
unprovoked invasion"". Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
"PM to hold Ukraine talks with Sweden and FinlandBoris Johnson will meet the leaders of both nations, as they debate whether to join Nato.","Boris Johnson will visit Sweden and Finland to discuss the war in Ukraine, amid debate within both nations about whether to join the Nato alliance. The prime minister is scheduled to meet leaders of both countries during a 24-hour trip on Wednesday. Mr Johnson is expected to discuss Europe's response to the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine. Mr Johnson's official spokesman said the visit was also about the ""security of Europe more broadly"". ""We understand the positions of Sweden and Finland and that is why the prime minister is going to discuss these broader security issues,"" he said. Asked whether the two countries' possible membership of the alliance would be discussed, the prime minister's spokesman said: ""We support democratic capabilities to decide on things like Nato membership."" Mr Johnson will give a news conference in each country, travelling to Sweden first before going on to Finland and then returning to the UK. Are Finland and Sweden going from neutral to Nato? What is Nato and could Finland and Sweden join? Is Nato's Nordic expansion a threat or boost to Europe? Nato - the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation - is a 30-nation defensive alliance founded shortly after the end of World War Two. It has its headquarters in Brussels, but is dominated by the massive military and nuclear missile power of the US. Support for joining Nato has increased in both both Sweden and Finland since Russia invaded Ukraine, despite their long history of pursuing policies of military neutrality to avoid conflict with regional powers. Finland and Sweden are both modern, democratic countries that fulfil the criteria for membership. Nato's chief, secretary general Jens Stoltenberg, has said the alliance would welcome them with open arms and there would be minimum delay in processing their membership. Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin (R) met Swedish leader Magdalena Andersson in Stockholm to discuss Nato in mid-April During a visit to Sweden in April, Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin said ""everything had changed"" when Russia invaded Ukraine and told reporters Finland must to be ""prepared for all kinds of actions from Russia"". Her comments coincided with thepublication of a security reportthat warned membership of Nato could result in ""increased tensions on the border between Finland and Russia"". At the same time, Ms Marin's Swedish counterpart Magdalena Andersson told reporters that the same ""very serious analysis"" was taking place as in Finland and she saw no point in delaying it. Finland for decades, and Sweden for centuries, have chosen to adopt a kind of neutral status rather than enter any military alliance. But Russia's invasion of Ukraine has transformed public opinion in both countries. People seem now to want the protection that Nato membership can provide. But neither country would get the alliance's security guarantee - that an attack on one member is an attack on all - until their application has been accepted. That could take some months. Until that point, there is a moment of vulnerability. So what will be interesting is to see what kind of support the UK - and other countries - might be prepared to provide Sweden and Finland in the meantime, during that so-called ""grey zone"" between both countries' application and accession to the Western military alliance. Finnish Foreign Minister Pekka Haavisto subsequently said it would be ""useful"" for Sweden and Finland to launch joint Nato membership bids, but added no fixed date had been set for any potential application. However, Russia has warned them not to and threatened ""a military technical response"" if they do try to join. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov stressed that Moscow would have to ""rebalance the situation"" with its own measures if any bid went ahead. In a speech last month, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said they should be admitted ""as soon as possible"" if they decided to apply for membership. Mr Johnson held talks with Ms Andersson and Finnish president Sauli Niinisto in March as part of a meeting of the Joint Expeditionary Force nations, which includes Denmark, Estonia, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands and Norway. After the meeting, No 10 said the leaders had all agreed the invasion of Ukraine had ""dramatically changed the landscape of European security"". Finland shares a land border of 830 miles (1,340km) with Russia and is only about 250 miles from St Petersburg.

John Kirby, press secretary for the US Ministry of Defence, added ""we're working to better clarify the [Turkey's] position here"". Law enforcement officers in Ukraine are investigating 41 Russian servicemen suspected of having committed war crimes in the country, Interfax-Ukraine news agency reports. Prosecutor-General Iryna Venediktova said the suspects will be investigated for a range of crimes - from the bombing of civilian infrastructure, killing of civilians, rape and looting. The suspects will answer before a Ukrainian court of law, she added. Today, a Russian soldier accused of killing an unarmed 62-year-old civilian appeared in court in Kyiv. Vadim Shishimarin, 21, was brought to court for a preliminary hearing. He faces possible life imprisonment on charges of war crimes and premeditated murder. During a televised address on Friday evening, Venediktova said preliminary hearings on two more suspects will be carried out next week. The leader of breakaway region South Ossetia has announced a referendum on whether to become a part of Russia. A statement from the office of Anatoly Bibilov said it was his people's ""historic aspiration"" to come together with Russia, and the vote would take place on 17 July. Moscow recognises the region as independent, after a brief war between Russia and Georgia in 2008, and has provided financial support, Russian citizenship for its citizens and sited military bases there. Georgia maintains that South Ossetia is an occupied territory and previously said that a referendum on joining Russia would be unacceptable. Negotiations with Russia over freeing the Ukrainian fighters under siege in the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol were ""very difficult"", Ukraine's deputy prime minister has said. In an online post, Iryna
Vereshchuk wrote: ""The result may not be to everyone's liking, but our task is
to evacuate our boys. All of them. ""Alive."" Yesterday, the Ukrainian government said that it was pushing for safe passage for 38 badly wounded fighters, in exchange for captured Russians. The Azovstal complex once sheltered hundreds of civilians and fighters, but after several weeks trapped underground civilians were freed in a series of humanitarian convoys last week and negotiations over the fighters began. The Russian air force has attacked an arms depot in the Kharkiv region in Ukraine, state news agency RIA reports. The news agency quoted the Russian defence ministry saying it had hit the facility on Friday. Meanwhile, eyewitnesses to an earlier attack in Kharkiv told news agency AFP that they had been targeted by a Russian tank as they tried to seek shelter at home. ""Four people died, two were injured. My daughter died from a shrapnel wound in the back of her head,"" Olga Karpenko, 52, said. The BBC has not been able to independently verify this information. Sergei Shoigu (pictured) spoke with his US counterpart for an hour More details have emerged of the telephone call between US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin and Russia's Defence Minister Sergei Shoygu, in which General Austin called for an immediate ceasefire. Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said that Gen Austin had stressed the importance of maintaining communication, after Moscow had appeared uninterested in speaking to the US on previous attempts to hold the conversation. An anonymous US official said the tone of the hour-long call was ""professional"", but did not resolve any specific issues or lead to changes in Russian policy, news agency Reuters report. Russia's defence ministry confirmed that the US had initiated the call, and discussed ""topical issues of international security... including the situation in Ukraine"". Olga IvshinaSenior correspondent, BBC News Russian Since the start of the war, our team has been following and verifying reports of losses among Russian troops fighting in Ukraine by following official announcements, local media reports as well as social media and speaking to the relatives of Russian servicemen. Up to this moment BBC News Russian has been able to verify the deaths of 2,336 Russian servicemen. We have been able to establish their names, ranks and military units where they served. This is nearly twice the latest official figure released by the Russian Defence Ministry in March. It is likely that the real figure of the Russian military in Ukraine is far higher than we have been able to establish. But our data analysis helps to see the trends of what is happening with the Russian army fighting in Ukraine. Nearly 20% of all confirmed military casualties are officers. This proportion has remained unchanged for the past three months. Experts say that Russian officers may have to risk more on the frontline because of persistent problems with communications. Over 25% of all losses are paratroopers and marines. These units are often used in reconnaissance and storming operations. However they often donât get enough operational support and evacuation opportunities for the wounded. Most of the casualties, confirmed by us, came from the least developed and economically deprived regions of Russia. There are only three confirmed deaths of servicemen from Moscow, even though the capital makes up almost 9% of the Russian population. Ukrainian authorities now say that nearly 27,000 Russian soldiers have been killed. Read the full story on the BBC's Russian service here. As we've been reporting, Ukraine's Defence Minister Oleksiy Reznikov has said the country is entering a new stage of the war. Reznikov pledged to arm a million fighters using the new weapons and military equipment the US and other Western countries have been donating to the country over the last couple of weeks. The defence minister said that during the beginning of the war, ""volunteers were extremely helpful"" and it's thanks to their mobility that they ""quickly resolved highly pressing issues"". Reznikov said that to win, Ukraine ""must plan resources carefully and avoid mistakes"" and was investing in Ukrainian production facilities to ""ensure the stability and frequency of deliveries"". In his statement on Facebook, he said that Ukraine had relied on charitable aid from citizens, volunteers, and civic organisations for a significant proportion of its military equipment. He said that at the end of April, Ukraine's ministry of defence was relying on donations for 50% of the bullet proof vests used in combat. But as of 13 May, Ukraine has managed to increase its production to provide 57% of the armed forces' bullet proof vests, he added. More now on the suspension of electricity exports from Russia to Finland, which followed rising tensions over Helsinki's announcement of its plan to join Nato. RAO Nordic, a subsidiary of the Russian company Inter RAO, said non-payment was behind its decision to halt electrity supplies. The company said they had not received funds since 6 May and described the situation as ""exceptional"", adding that it is the first time it's happened ""in over 20 years of our trading history"". It did not specify whether this was due to the impact of sanctions but added, ""we hope that the situation will get improved soon and the electricity trade with Russia could resume"". Meanwhlle, the Finnish grid operator Fingrid said it did not anticpate any problems with supply as a result of the suspension. It said it would make up the shortfall by generating more power domestically and increasing imports from Sweden. This video can not be played Scenes of devastation as 'Russian battalion destroyed' If you're just joining us, here's a little recap of the latest events in Ukraine to bring you up to speed. Russian bridge-building foiled  Beyond the Donbas region  In diplomacy Ukraine's defence minister has said he hopes to arm a million fighters as the country prepares for a ""new, long phase of war"". Oleksiy Reznikov noted in a Facebook post that Ukraine would ""need to meticulously plan resources"" and ""avoid mistakes"" in order to win the war. Already, he said, Russia had suffered a ""strategic defeat"". The arrival of foreign weapons and ""stimulating Ukrainian producers"" would help further tip the balance against Russia, he continued. But before that, Ukraine was ""facing extremely difficult weeks ahead"". ""Nobody can tell how many. In that period, we will hold the defence primarily with our own resources against the enemy mad with rage,"" he predicted, in comments translated by our colleagues at BBC Monitoring. ""Increasing pressure of sanctions against Russia and increasing foreign assistance to Ukraine should create, within several months, the conditions under which the Kremlin will finally lose all chances to achieve any success. Then a new window of opportunity will appear for Ukraine. In this extremely hard period, we need unity, cohesion, will and patience,"" he concluded. Electricity exports from Russia to Finland are being suspended from 01:00 local time (22:00 GMT) on Saturday. Finnish grid operator Fingrid said Russian utility Inter RAO was stopping supplies due to ""problems in receiving payments for electricity sold on the market"". The announcement comes the day after Finland signalled its intention to join Nato. Finland only buys 10% of its electricity from Russia, and according to Fingrid it will make up the shortfall by sourcing more power from Sweden, and increasing generation in Finland. Finland expects to become self-sufficient in electrical energy in 2023, the company added. Sophie WilliamsBBC News, Lviv Ukraine says it's thwarted Russian attempts to create a key bridging point A Ukrainian military analyst admits that constant attacks
from Moscow mean the Ukrainians are on the back foot around the Siversky Donets
river â even though theyâve managed to thwart Russian attempts to put down
bridges near Severodonetsk. âThe advantage is now on the side of the Russian Federation,â
Oleh Zhdanov tells the BBC. âWe still can't bring down Russia's offensive pace.â Zhdanov says itâs âvery importantâ that his
side keeps control of this part of the Siversky Donets. Gaining the area would allow the Russians to make a
bridgehead and advance in the direction of the riverâs estuary, Zhdanov explains.
This would let them encircle the key city of Severodonetsk more fully as they
attempt to cut off Ukraineâs whole eastern Donbas region. The order for soldiers to gain this territory came
from the very top, Zhdanov adds. âThey are advancing so hard because it is a
political task, because Putin has ordered it,â he says. As weâve been reporting today, UK
defence intelligence says a Russian battalion lost almost all its armoured
vehicles during failed attempts to establish bridges across the river. Russia
has not commented. Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoygu and his US counterpart Lloyd Austin have spoken for the first time since 18 February - before Russia invaded Ukraine. According to a statement issued by the Pentagon, Austin urged an immediate ceasefire in Ukraine and used the call to emphasise the importance of maintaining lines of communication. On Wednesday, Austin held talks with UK Defence Minister Ben Wallace. In a statement, Wallace said the two leaders pledged ""to continue to work with unity and resolve to provide
Ukraine with what it needs to defend itself against Russiaâs
unprovoked invasion"". Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
"Chronic pain treatments failing millions, say expertsSpecialists warn the NHS is not set up to deal with such complex conditions.","Jen Proudler lives in constant pain and is desperate for a better way to manage her condition. Relentless. Unbearable. Overwhelming. These are just some of the words used by the thousands of people who have revealed their battle with long-term, persistent pain. Anexclusive survey of over 4,000 adults aged 16-75 for BBC News, carried out by research company Ipsos, suggests that a quarter of people in the UK are living with chronic pain - an often hidden and misunderstood condition. And pain specialists warn the health service is not set up to deal with such complex conditions. They say the treatments on offer are decades behind the science, leaving millions of patients without the support they need to manage their pain. Chronic pain - defined as pain that lasts longer than three months - can drastically change people's lives. It can be caused by a physical problem - such as a slipped disc, but can also occur with no clear cause - known as primary pain. It destroys careers, breaks up relationships, steals independence and denies people the futures they had imagined. Jen Proudler says chronic pain has left her grieving for ""the person she was"". It started four years ago with sporadic back pain, which she managed with the help of hot baths and paracetamol. Now she relies on opioid patches, anti-inflammatories, nerve pain medications and beta-blockers just to get through the day. ""It has flipped everything upside down,"" she says. ""I feel I've lost every part of my life. I've lost me."" Jen, 38, who lives with her partner in Farsley near Leeds, was working as a dental hygienist and had a busy social life when she first started experiencing pain in February 2018. Jen Proudler used to work as a dental hygienist - a job she loved Her doctor said it was a problem with a disc in her back and advised taking some time off. Jen rested for about eight weeks, then went back to work. The pain hadn't gone away but she felt she needed to get back to ""some kind of normality"". ""There were days when it was really bad, but I have this attitude of battling through it, because that's what you do,"" she says. But nine months after the pain first began, Jen was driving to work when she felt the most excruciating pain. ""It was how I would imagine being kicked in the back by a horse."" Later that day she lost all sensation in her right leg. That was the last time she made it to work. After several incorrect diagnoses, Jen was eventually told by a neurosurgeon that she had a ""pretty massive"" far lateral disc herniation in her spine - a slipped disc that then compresses the nerves around it. But by then something was going on - her body's defence system had gone into overdrive in response to the agony she was experiencing. The pain has now spread around her body - Jen has burning pins and needles sensations down her leg, as well as sharp pain, as if being cut by a razor. Sometimes it's so bad, she can't even bear any fabric to touch it. ""Our nervous system becomes more and more protective, it feels danger and sends warning signals - and those warning signals contribute to the pain,"" explains Dr Chris Barker, clinical director of an NHS community pain service in Ainsdale, Merseyside. He says such pain can be hard to diagnose, and the difficulty of getting the correct treatment can make things worse. ""Incorrect diagnoses, delayed diagnoses, poor experiences in and out of the health system, not being believed - all of these can contribute to a more intense experience of pain."" Dr Barker says the NHS is not set up to deal with such a complex condition, despite the fact it is so common. ""The prevalence of pain is huge. It dwarfs most other conditions."" Dr Chris Barker leads a team of psychologists, pharmacists and physiotherapists The BBC study is the most recent snapshot - previous studies have found chronic pain affects between 20-50% of the UK - and the prevalence may be even higher in older age groups. Persistent pain that lasts more than three months, despite medication or other forms of treatment Secondary chronic pain is a pain which tends to be caused by another condition, for example, arthritis, endometriosis, cancer pain Primary chronic pain is a condition in its own right - there is no known condition other than the pain itself - this can include conditions such as fibromyalgia or complex regional pain syndrome Chronic pain is often confused with acute pain - a short-term pain such as a broken bone or a torn muscle Latest guidelines from the health regulator National Institute of Health and Care Excellence,external(NICE) say chronic primary pain should not be treated with opioids, or even paracetamol, while inScotland, opioids can be prescribed for chronic pain,externalin certain cases. Yet the results from BBC's Ipsos survey suggest nearly a quarter of those who live with chronic pain are currently taking opioids - ranging from medication such as codeine to more powerful painkillers like morphine and fentanyl. Opioids are useful for short-term, acute pain, but there is little evidence they help long-term, persistent pain. Despite this, opioid prescribing more than doubled between 1998 to 2018. It prompted the MHRA, the UK's medicine regulator, to issue stronger warnings around the risk of addiction and overdose. Our research suggests that more than 40% of those currently using opioids began taking them over five years ago, before these warnings were issued. Sitting at her kitchen table, packets of pills stacked up nearby, Jen says every day now revolves around managing her pain. Despite the support of her GP, she is struggling to see a way forward. She says the medication helps her function, but she worries she's running out of options in the long term. Pain specialists believe the science calls for a different approach involving more support, more tailored care and most importantly, more options of how to cope with such a life-changing condition. Chronic pain: Antidepressants not painkillers recommended Dr Cathy Stannard, clinical lead on persistent pain for NICE, says medication like opioids has very little benefit for people with certain types of chronic pain. She fears millions of patients are not getting the bespoke treatment needed for such a complex condition. But the other options are a difficult sell to a patient in distress - especially in an under-pressure health service where they often don't get the chance to build up a trusting, empathetic relationship. ""People who are living with pain very understandably present with high levels of distress. When they say, 'Are you going to leave me in pain?' it is very difficult to say 'Yes.' It is always with the best intentions that we prescribe medicines, but often, it is a response to distress rather than a rational clinical decision."" Patients tend to need the support of their GP, physiotherapists, psychologists and pharmacists. Depending on the condition, medication can be helpful but may only be part of the treatment - other elements that help include: Exercise Physical therapies (hot or cold packs, massage, hydrotherapy) Physiotherapy Acupuncture Psychological therapies (trauma therapy, cognitive behaviour therapy, meditation) Community support groups Dr Stannard stresses the NICE guidelines were not written to take medication away from people who feel it is helping them. The problem, she says, is the lack of options or tailored treatment for such a complex condition - and too often medication becomes the only answer, instead of part of it. And no-one should stop or change their medication without speaking to their doctor. Benjamin Ellis, a consultant rheumatologist and senior policy advisor for the charity Versus Arthritis, agrees, and says that while opioids can help people manage some conditions like osteoarthritis, too often they are seen as a long-term answer. ""The health system is set up to support the prescribing of medication rather than supporting patients to access other treatments - physical activity, programmes to help people with their mental health, community support, peer support - they're not so readily available, and even where they are, they're not well connected with health services."" Lorraine English's story illustrates the potential dangers of being prescribed opioids long term. She was a busy single mum with four kids, working as a teaching assistant, when she started to notice pain that had started in her neck and spread into her head and back. It led to her taking high doses of opioids, including morphine, for 12 years - at times she says she felt like her life was over. ""It was so frightening, so isolating"". With the help of her GP, Lorraine has weaned herself off opioids Lorraine, from Burnage, south Manchester, was eventually diagnosed with degenerative disc disease, osteoarthritis and fibromyalgia - a condition which causes all-over body pain and extreme tiredness. ""I would get nerve pain shooting through my head and it would cause migraines, light-sensitivity - just my heel touching the floor would send pain up into my head."" As the pain continued, her opioid dose increased, while her ability to cope decreased. Eventually she had to give up work, taking pill after pill to beat what is known as ""breakthrough pain"" - a flare-up of pain despite being on huge doses of painkillers. For the last three years of her life on morphine, Lorraine was unable to function - bed-bound, existing in a fog of medication, her life ruled by pain. ""It's like being in a medicated coma and you can't reach out to anybody, because you're not even aware anyone's out there. I felt like that for years, just laid in bed with my kids checking on me, asking, 'You okay?'"" Lorraine kept a pain diary in 2017 which she hoped would help but just reminds her of how difficult her life was. Lorraine says she realised that she needed to reduce her medication - not only was she struggling to function, but she felt it was making the pain worse. It took nearly a year, but with the help of her GP, Lorraine has gradually tapered off her opioid medication, and the pain has reduced. Now opioid-free, she says she has learned to ""embrace"" the pain she still feels, and understand her body's limits. ""No matter how much pain I am in, I want to be able to manage it so I can hug my grandkids,"" she says. People who live with chronic pain have told us how difficult it is to access any specialist services. Our research suggests that nearly a quarter (23%) of those living with chronic pain are on waiting lists for surgery or a pain management programme. An NHS spokesperson said more clinical pharmacists and trained staff are being recruited and will be based at GP surgeries so patients can get access to specialist care and be ""offered alternatives to medication where appropriate"". There are areas of the UK which are offering a whole patient approach, like at Dr Barker's clinic in Ainsdale, Merseyside, where he leads a team of pharmacists, physiotherapists and psychologists. This video can not be played At the age of 13 Luke woke up in horrific pain and a decade on his condition is still undiagnosed. Over the last 20 years, he says, the scientific understanding of pain - how our brains respond, how we process it - has been transformed. Hurt does not always equal harm, he explains, and someone can be in pain without any physical injury. ""Our traditional model of thinking about pain is about MRI scans and looking for structural things - the problem is we interpret that to mean that's going to be the cause of pain."" ""While youâre laughing youâre not crying"" says Kev, who runs a chronic pain peer support group in Merseyside Chronic pain is far more complex than that - an overly sensitised nervous system can change a normal signal from one of the body's sensors into a threat signal which our brain then interprets as pain. There may be many complex reasons why the nervous system has been put on ""red alert"", he says. If people are dealing with trauma, stress or grief, that can contribute to chronic pain. A Life Of Pain The BBC News investigation unearths huge numbers of people living with chronic pain. In an exclusive documentary, Dominic Hughes hears stories from those in pain, across the UK. Watch on BBC iPlayer now. This is why, Dr Barker says, sharing experiences can play a vital role when living with pain. Many of his patients attend Pain Clinic Plus, a peer support group at his clinic. ""People tend to become isolated because they can't do what they used to do, so people stop phoning them,"" says Kev Howard, one of the organisers, who has lived with pain for years following a shoulder injury. ""It's so easy to sit at home and take a pill and fall asleep. The other way to go is to pop into groups similar to this, and basically have a laugh - because while you're laughing you're not crying.""

London mayor blames Trump for rise in online abuse,"Sadiq Khan says he has received at least 233,000 ""explicitly racist or racialised social media messages"" since being elected mayor of London in 2016. Addressing Stanford University students in California, Mr Khan partly blamed a 1,892% rise in abuse to Donald Trump's election as US president. A feud started in 2017 when Mr Trump criticised the mayor over his response to the London Bridge terror attacks. ""He's not my biggest fan,"" Mr Khan told the audience in Silicon Valley.

UK winner scoops biggest ever EuroMillions jackpot,"Tuesday's winning ticket will net the ticket holder Â£184,262,899.10. A UK ticket holder has claimed the Â£184m EuroMillions prize, the country's biggest National Lottery jackpot. Tuesday's winning numbers were 3, 25, 27, 28 and 29 - plus Lucky Star numbers 4 and 9. Camelot, the firm behind the National Lottery, said a single ticket-holder had come forward to claim the ""life-changing and record-breaking win"". It means 15 UK players have now won jackpots of more than Â£100m since EuroMillions launched in 2004. ""This is absolutely incredible news,"" said Camelot's Andy Carter, senior winners' adviser at the National Lottery, adding: ""We're ecstatic that we've now received a claim. ""Our focus now is on supporting the ticket holder through the process and helping them start to enjoy their truly life-changing and record-breaking win."" The claim will now go through a validation process to ensure terms and conditions are met and once the ticket has been validated the winner can choose whether or not to remain anonymous. This is the second EuroMillions jackpot won in the UK this year, with the Â£109 million jackpot from the draw on 4 February claimed a few days later, when the winner chose not to go public. Until Tuesday's result, the biggest lottery win in the UK was Â£170m in October 2019. The winner chose to remain anonymous. Colin and Chris Weir, who won Â£161m in 2011, are the biggest winners to have gone public. Mr Weirused his fortune to take over his favourite football club, Partick Thistle, with the intention of giving ownership to the fans.  Â£170mBritain's richest ever lottery winner stayed anonymous after their win in October 2019. Â£161mColin and Chris Weir (pictured) from North Ayrshire, Scotland in 2011. Â£148mAdrian and Gillian Bayford, from Suffolk, in 2012. Â£123mAnonymous UK ticket-holder in June 2019. Â£122mAnonymous UK ticket-holder in April 2021. The couple, from North Ayrshire,announced they were divorcingin 2019 after 38 years of marriage, and months laterMr Weir died, aged 71. The transferral of the ownership of Partick Thistle is currently in a state of flux, following a dispute between fans, the Thistle board and the company that currently holds Mr Weir's shares. Frances Connolly, who - along with husband Patrick - won Â£115m in 2019, making them the lottery's eighth biggest winners, revealed last month she had given away more than half of her fortune. The 55-year-old, from Hartlepool, said helping others ""gives you a buzz"", adding: ""I'm addicted to it now."" However, even Tuesday's winnings are small change compared with the Powerball and Mega Millions lottery games held in the US, which offer huge sums in a league of their own - albeit not tax-free, as is the case with winnings in Europe. Powerball holds the current world record for the largest lottery prize awarded. In January 2016, the advertised jackpot stood at $1.586bn (Â£1.2bn), surpassing the $1bn threshold for the first time - the winnings were ultimately shared among three ticket holders. The biggest individual win came two years later, with a single ticket holder from South Carolina pocketing a Mega Millions jackpot of $1.537bn - $878m (Â£709m) after tax.

James was diagnosed in 2016 and gave candid accounts of her treatment on the BBC's You, Me and the Big C podcast. In her final episode she says that even after five years, knowing she is now nearing the end is ""still shocking"". She has also spoken of feeling ""utterly loved"" after more than Â£1m was donated to a cancer research fund she set up. Inthe podcast interview, the 40-year-old said she did not ""feel brave"" afterrevealing on Instagram on Monday,externalthat nobody knows how long she has left to live. She said her liver had stopped working over the past six months and doctors had advised that more treatment was ""fruitless"" because her ""body does not want to play ball"". ""I can't even walk anymore, that's what's really scary about it, I've gone from someone who used to run 5km [3miles] a day to someone who needs her husband to pick her up to walk a step."" My body can't continue, says Big C's Deborah James BBC presenter Rachael Bland dies aged 40 Rachael Bland 'changed my life' The broadcaster said she had gone to her parents' home to spend her remaining time with her family because it was ""where I always wanted to die"". She explained this meant their family home in London could remain home for her children without the ""medical equipment scars"" in their memories. Asked what hosting the podcast meant to her, James said it had given purpose back to her life after being diagnosed, adding the show had made her realise the influence she could have ""saving another life or making someone not feel alone"". ""Yes I would give my cancer up in a second just to have a normal life again. But to be able to do it and feel like you've had an impact is kind of one of the best feelings you can have."" After thanking listeners for their support over the years, she said: ""Please, please just enjoy life because it's so precious. All I want right now is more time and more life."" She ended the show with a customary caution for people to ""check your poo"" for signs of bowel or other cancers, adding: ""Come on, I can't leave on on any other word.""

The fund, named after her online handle, will work with the charity Cancer Research UK, Bowel Cancer UK and the Royal Marsden, to allocate the money. Thousands of donations flooded in after she revealed the news on Monday, with donations already exceeding Â£2.1m. In an interview due to be broadcast on BBC Breakfast on Wednesday, the former deputy head teacher revealed her surprise at the speed at which the smashed through its fundraising goal of Â£250,000. She said: ""I had a figure in my mind of about a quarter of a million, because I thought that would be enough to fund a good couple of projects across the charities that I wanted to fund. ""But in 24 hours to do a million, I'm like absolutely mind blown and I just cannot thank people enough for their generosity. ""Because it just means so much to me. It makes me feel utterly loved. ""It makes me feel like we're all kind of in it at the end together and we all want to make a difference."" This video can not be played Watch: Deborah James speaks about her diagnosis to raise awareness (May 2019) After the opening day's whirlwind fundraising efforts - which has seen donations from more than 85,000 people - James told the BBC that her dying wish was to help raise money for the ""things that gave me life"". She explained that were it not for experimental treatments she would have died at least two years ago, adding that she wanted other people to be given the same opportunities. James said: ""Ultimately what I really want to happen is I don't want any other Deborahs to have to go through this. ""We know that when we catch cancer early, we can cure it. We know that much more investment needs to take place in cancer."" She added it was clear the UK had ""skills and the passion"" to develop new cancer therapies, but sometimes a reminder was needed to get a ""boost"" for funding.

James began co-presenting You, Me and the Big C alongside Lauren Mahon and BBC Radio 5 Live newsreader Rachael Bland in 2018, with the show earning praise for its frank discussion of cancer. They spoke to celebrity guests and addressed practical matters including hair loss, tips for dealing with finances and telling your nearest and dearest. Bland died at the age of 40 six months after the show launched. She had been diagnosed with breast cancer two years earlier. Speaking about her friend on their podcast, James said she she was ""always in my mind actually, even now"". ""I just don't know how brave she must have been to do what she did, because I don't feel that brave. ""I think I'm still in awe of how she just seemed to just take it in her stride and, quite frankly, I'm a quivering mess half the time. But I think if she can do it, I can do it and I'll go and party with her."" James has been praised for her no-nonsense approach to talking about cancer online, and has shared her experiences of treatment and daily life with her social media followers since her diagnosis. She has worked to remove the embarrassment factor from bowel cancer, and even shared a video of herself walking down the street dressed as a poo emoji to encourage people to watch out for changes to their bowel movements.

"UK winner scoops biggest ever EuroMillions jackpotThe ticket holder, who has won Â£184m, is the 15th person to receive a pay-out of more than Â£100m.UK","Tuesday's winning ticket will net the ticket holder Â£184,262,899.10. A UK ticket holder has claimed the Â£184m EuroMillions prize, the country's biggest National Lottery jackpot. Tuesday's winning numbers were 3, 25, 27, 28 and 29 - plus Lucky Star numbers 4 and 9. Camelot, the firm behind the National Lottery, said a single ticket-holder had come forward to claim the ""life-changing and record-breaking win"". It means 15 UK players have now won jackpots of more than Â£100m since EuroMillions launched in 2004. ""This is absolutely incredible news,"" said Camelot's Andy Carter, senior winners' adviser at the National Lottery, adding: ""We're ecstatic that we've now received a claim. ""Our focus now is on supporting the ticket holder through the process and helping them start to enjoy their truly life-changing and record-breaking win."" The claim will now go through a validation process to ensure terms and conditions are met and once the ticket has been validated the winner can choose whether or not to remain anonymous. This is the second EuroMillions jackpot won in the UK this year, with the Â£109 million jackpot from the draw on 4 February claimed a few days later, when the winner chose not to go public. Until Tuesday's result, the biggest lottery win in the UK was Â£170m in October 2019. The winner chose to remain anonymous. Colin and Chris Weir, who won Â£161m in 2011, are the biggest winners to have gone public. Mr Weirused his fortune to take over his favourite football club, Partick Thistle, with the intention of giving ownership to the fans.  Â£170mBritain's richest ever lottery winner stayed anonymous after their win in October 2019. Â£161mColin and Chris Weir (pictured) from North Ayrshire, Scotland in 2011. Â£148mAdrian and Gillian Bayford, from Suffolk, in 2012. Â£123mAnonymous UK ticket-holder in June 2019. Â£122mAnonymous UK ticket-holder in April 2021. The couple, from North Ayrshire,announced they were divorcingin 2019 after 38 years of marriage, and months laterMr Weir died, aged 71. The transferral of the ownership of Partick Thistle is currently in a state of flux, following a dispute between fans, the Thistle board and the company that currently holds Mr Weir's shares. Frances Connolly, who - along with husband Patrick - won Â£115m in 2019, making them the lottery's eighth biggest winners, revealed last month she had given away more than half of her fortune. The 55-year-old, from Hartlepool, said helping others ""gives you a buzz"", adding: ""I'm addicted to it now."" However, even Tuesday's winnings are small change compared with the Powerball and Mega Millions lottery games held in the US, which offer huge sums in a league of their own - albeit not tax-free, as is the case with winnings in Europe. Powerball holds the current world record for the largest lottery prize awarded. In January 2016, the advertised jackpot stood at $1.586bn (Â£1.2bn), surpassing the $1bn threshold for the first time - the winnings were ultimately shared among three ticket holders. The biggest individual win came two years later, with a single ticket holder from South Carolina pocketing a Mega Millions jackpot of $1.537bn - $878m (Â£709m) after tax.

"Apple to discontinue the iPod after 21 yearsThe end of an era for Apple's original music player, which has been overshadowed by the iPhone.","The late Steve Jobs - then Apple CEO - at the launch of the iPod Touch in 2007 Apple has announced it is discontinuing its music player, the iPod Touch, bringing to an end a device widely praised for revolutionising how people listen to music. When the first iPod was launched in 2001, it could store 1,000 tracks. Today there are more than 90 million songs on Apple's streaming service. The iPod Touch was designed by the same team that later invented the iPhone, which quickly overshadowed the iPod. Apple last updated the iPod in 2019. There have been various iPod models over the years - including the Nano and Shuffle - but the iPod Touch, which was released in 2007 is the last model to be discontinued. Apple says it will remain available to buy ""while stocks last"". The gadget had ""redefined how music is discovered, listened to, and shared"", Greg Joswiak, the senior vice-president of worldwide marketing at Apple said. iPod fans have taken to social media to share their thoughts on the news and their memories connected with the music devices.

The first model of the iPod was revealed by Apple boss Steve Jobs in typical Apple style in 2001 - with much fanfare, anticipation and in his trademark jeans and black turtleneck. There had been rumours the company was going to announce a new music player after the invitation for the launch event read: ""Hint: It's not a Mac."" ""Music's a part of everyone's life. Music's been around forever. It will always be around,"" Jobs said during his hour long presentation. The big headline for the night was simple: ""1,000 songs in your pocket."" Over the years, many celebrities have thrown their star power behind the iPod, including John Mayer, U2 and Oprah Winfrey. BMW introduced the first car entertainment system with a built-in iPod system, and within a few years, most car manufacturers had followed suit. Steve Jobs: Career in pictures The cult of Apple's Steve Jobs But tech analysist say it was inevitable the iPhone would one day replace the iPod. ""When Apple created the iPhone it knew that it would ultimately mean the beginning of the end of the iPod,"" Ben Wood, chief analyst at technology advisory firm CCS Insight, told the BBC. Carolina Milanesi from Creative Strategies said the decline of iPod sales was connected to the rise of iPhone sales - like the move from digital sales to streaming. ""The demise of the iPod is probably the best example of Apple not being concerned about cannibalising its own products,"" she said. The iPod wasn't the first MP3 player on the market, just like the iPhone wasn't the first smartphone - but that unique Apple design proved to be the push digital music needed to start to tempt people away from CD and cassette players - and file-sharing. In 2001 the music industry was fighting for survival against illegal file-sharing as tunes were ripped and shared on platforms faster than record labels could issue legal threats. The launch of iTunes, and the iPod shortly afterwards, provided it with a lifeline in the form of revenue for legitimately purchased downloads. It also revived the fortunes of Apple, which was languishing in a market dominated by Windows PCs. It was introduced on stage by the late Steve Jobs at an event on 23 October 2001. ""With iPod, listening to music will never be the same again,"" he said. And in many ways, he was right.

"UK rejects EU plans to deal with NI ProtocolThe foreign secretary Lizz Truss says she will not shy away from taking ""decisive action"".","Liz Truss says the EU's proposals, released last October, could lead to ""everyday items disappearing from shelves"" The UK has rejected EU plans aimed at reducing the impact of the post-Brexit treaty for Northern Ireland, saying they would make things worse. The EU claims the proposals would reduce paperwork and checks on goods entering NI from Great Britain. But the government says they would ""worsen the current trading arrangements"". The UK verdict is part of an escalating dispute which could soon see the government scrapping parts of the deal. The protocol is an issue under fresh scrutiny following elections to the Northern Ireland Assembly. The elections cemented a majority for assembly members who accept the protocol, including the new largest party, the republican party Sinn FÃ©in. But the second largest party, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), said it would not nominate ministers to form a new executive in Northern Ireland until its concerns with the protocol were resolved. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said, in a statement released on Tuesday night, that her preference had always been for a ""negotiated solution"" but that she would not shy away from ""taking action to stabilise the situation in Northern Ireland if solutions cannot be found"". What is the Northern Ireland Protocol? A source close to Ms Truss said she believed the current situation could not ""drag on"", with the foreign secretary now eyeing domestic legislation to start scrapping parts of the treaty. The post-Brexit arrangement for Northern Ireland, known as the Protocol, isa special Brexit deal for Northern Irelanddesigned to prevent the return of a hard land border with the Republic of Ireland. It was agreed between the UK and the EU in 2019, put into domestic law by the UK Parliament and came into force in January 2021. It works by keeping Northern Ireland inside the EU's single market for goods. This means Northern Ireland continues to follow some EU laws and there are new checks and paperwork for goods which are imported into Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK. The EU acknowledges that it has caused difficulties for Northern Ireland businesses and its October proposals were an attempt to ease that burden. Under the protocol, checks are required on goods coming into Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK At the time, its chief negotiator, MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ, said it was a ""robust package of creative, practical solutions"". Much of that package concernedfood products which are subject to the greatest level of new checks. The EU said it would mean inspections of food products would be reduced far below what is usually required at single-market borders. However, the plan came with caveats and the UK said the EU needed to do more. But this government statement amounts to a public rejection of what the EU was proposing. It focuses on the fact that grace periods mean the protocol is not being fully implemented. It says if the grace periods were replaced with the EU proposals, the checks and controls would increase, and these plans would lead to ""everyday items disappearing off the shelves"". It claims a range of food would likely be unavailable in Northern Ireland shops if it originates from outside the EU, such as Thai green curry ready meals, New Zealand Lamb and Brazilian pork. It also claims ""sending a parcel to Northern Ireland would require more than 50 fields of information for the customs declaration for one parcel"". Earlier, Mr Å efÄoviÄ said that solutions could be found without changing the protocol, and the EU said it was ""bending over backwards"" to find solutions. Maros Sefcovic says solutions offered in October are ""robust and creative"" He pointed to how the EU had changed its laws to ensure medicines could be traded freely from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. He added that with ""political will and genuine commitment joint solutions to legitimate practical issuesâ¦ can be found within the framework of the protocol"". He warned that the protocol, as a cornerstone of the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement, was an international agreement and ""it's renegotiation is not an option"". Whitehall sources have suggested that, within government, Ms Truss' position is relatively hard-line. Former PM Theresa May said it was ""not the right move"" for the government to take unilateral action involving the protocol. Previously the UK has threatened to trigger what's known as Article 16. That is the provision within the protocol that could potentially see parts of the agreement suspended if the treaty is causing ""serious economic, societal or environmental difficulties"". A source close to the foreign secretary insisted that her ""absolute priority"" was protecting peace in Northern Ireland. ""We can't have the current situation drag on. That is why she's prepared to act if solutions can't be found with the EU, who still aren't prepared to show the requisite flexibility despite the seriousness of the issue,"" they said. The protocol is opposed by unionists, who argue it undermines Northern Ireland's place in the UK The UK has demanded fundamental changes to the treaty. It wants to remove checks entirely on goods destined to stay in Northern Ireland as well as overhaul VAT and governance arrangements. There is scepticism in Brussels about whether the UK will really push ahead with ditching parts of the protocol. ""From all her meetings with the EU and member states she knows exactly that this is a no-go for all of them,"" said one EU diplomat. ""So this can only be about catering to a domestic audience."" Another senior diplomat warned that such a move by the UK would only serve to ""delight"" Russian President Vladimir Putin. ""Contemplating to break international law and undermining Western unity at a time when Western democracies have come together to defend international law against Russia would be an utterly irresponsible move,"" they said. On Monday, Mrs May questioned in Parliament what the move to unilaterally scrap parts of the protocol would say about the UK's ""willingness to abide by treaties which it has signed"". And in a rebuke to Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, who said the protocol was harming the Good Friday Agreement, Mrs May added: ""I put a deal before this house which actually met the requirements of the Good Friday Agreement and actually enabled us not to have a border down the Irish Sea or to have a border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. ""Sadly, the DUP, and others across this house, chose to reject that, but it was just such an opportunity."" Mrs May, who stepped down in 2019, had proposed an insurance arrangement designed to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. It would have kept the UK in a ""single customs territory"" with the EU, and left Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods. British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss and European Commissioner in charge of Brexit negotiations MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ On Tuesday, the European Commission said it wanted to find practical solutions within the boundaries of the treaty, reiterating that its proposals weren't ""take it or leave it."" However a spokesman insisted there would be no renegotiation. Whitehall sources have indicated that there are divisions within the UK cabinet about unilateral moves to start scrapping parts of the protocol, with concerns it could spark a ""trade war."" Chancellor Rishi Sunak is understood to have given an ""assessment"" on the economic implications - a Downing Street source said that the government would act ""responsibly"" on the issue. The plan to legislate has also been described as just ""an option"" in Whitehall that is yet to formally reach cabinet. Ms Truss was expected to speak with her EU counterpart Mr Å efÄoviÄ in the coming days. Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) MÃ­cheÃ¡l Martin said he had a ""frank and honest"" exchange of views in his telephone call with Prime Minister Boris Johnson earlier on Tuesday about the blockages in restoring an executive. He said what was needed was a proper ""intensification"" of discussions between London and Brussels regarding the implementation of the protocol. The taoiseach said he set out in clear terms his ""serious concerns"" about any unilateral move by London. ""I shared my view that this would be the wrong approach.  It would be destabilising in Northern Ireland and would further erode trust,"" he said. GOVERNMENT CRISIS:What happens next?
