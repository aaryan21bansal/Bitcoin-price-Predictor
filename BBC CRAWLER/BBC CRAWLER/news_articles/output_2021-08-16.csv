Bezos sues Nasa over its deal with Elon Musk's SpaceX,"Mr Bezos flew to space with his brother Mark (L) in July, in the first crewed flight of his New Shepard spacecraft Jeff Bezos's space firm Blue Origin is suing Nasa over a decision to award a $2.9bn (Â£2.1bn) lunar lander contract to Elon Musk's SpaceX. The former Amazon boss's firm said there were ""fundamental issues"" with the deal, calling it unfair. The row stems from a decision in April to hand the deal to one company, not two as expected, because of a funding shortfall. Nasa is yet to comment, but it has the backing of a federal watchdog. In a court filing on Friday, Blue Origin said it continued to believe that two providers were needed to build the landing system, which will carry astronauts down to the Moon's surface as early as 2024. It also accused Nasa of ""unlawful and improper evaluation"" of its proposals during the tender process. Bezos' $2bn offer to get back in race to the Moon ""We firmly believe that the issues identified in this procurement and its outcomes must be addressed to restore fairness, create competition and ensure a safe return to the Moon for America,"" Blue Origin said. At the time of the award, Nasa's human exploration chief, Kathy Lueders, admitted that the space agency's current budget precluded it from selecting two companies. That was after Congress granted it only $850m of the $3.3bn it requested for the project. Nasa also cited the proven record of orbital missions by Elon Musk's SpaceX firm as a factor in the award. Cost is also thought to have played a role: SpaceX's bid was the lowest-priced by some distance. In July, Mr Bezos offered to cover up to $2bn of Nasa's costs in order to be reconsidered for the contract, but he was rebuffed. US watchdog the Government Accountability Office (GAO), meanwhile, rejected a complaint from Blue Origin and defence contractor Dynetic, saying that Nasa had not ""acted improperly"" in handing the contract to just one firm. Nasa must file a response to the legal action by 12 October. SpaceX is yet to comment on the lawsuit. Under its Artemis programme, Nasa hopes to return humans to the moon for the first time since 1972. In April, Ms Lueders said: ""This critical step puts humanity on a path to sustainable lunar exploration and keeps our eyes on missions farther into the solar system, including Mars.""

What next for Afghanistan's economy?,"The Taliban have foreign aid donors worried Afghanistan's economy is ""shaped by fragility and aid dependence"". That is the troublingoverview set out by the World Bank,externalseveral months before the Taliban takeover. Economic prospects look even more precarious now, as future financial assistance is under a cloud of uncertainty. Afghanistan does have substantial mineral resources, but the political situation has impeded their exploitation. The aid dependency is striking. In 2019, World Bank figures show development aid was equivalent to 22% of gross national income (which is not the same as GDP, but close to it). That is a high figure, but it is down a long way from the 49%the World Bank reported 10 years earlier,external. Now those aid flows are under a cloud of profound uncertainty. German Foreign Minister Heike Maas told the broadcaster ZDF last week: ""We will not give another cent if the Taliban takes over the country and introduces Sharia law."" Other aid donors are sure to be watching developments closely. The fragility the World Bank refers to is illustrated by the very high levels of spending on security before the Taliban takeover: 29% of GDP, compared with an average of 3% for low-income countries. Security and severe problems with corruption are behind another persistent problem in Afghanistan: very weak foreign business investment. According to United Nations data, there were no announcements in the last two years of new ""greenfield"" investments, which involve a foreign business setting up an operation from scratch. Since 2014, there have been a total of four. To take two other countries from the South Asia region, both with somewhat smaller populations, Nepal has managed 10 times as many and Sri Lanka 50 times more over the same period. How much has the Afghanistan war cost? Kabul centre quiet and subdued after Taliban takeover Who are the Taliban? The World Bank describes Afghanistan's private sector as narrow. Employment is concentrated in low-productivity agriculture: 60% of households get some income from farming. The country also has a large illicit economy. There is illegal mining and, of course, opium production and related activities such as smuggling. The drugs trade has been an important source of revenue for the Taliban. All that said, the Afghan economy has grown since the US invasion in 2001. The figures for Afghanistan are not reliable, but what they show, according to the World Bank, is average annual growth of more than 9% in the 10 years from 2003. After that, it slowed (which may well reflect the lower levels of aid) to an average rate of 2.5% between 2015 and 2020. The drugs trade has been an important source of revenue for the Taliban The country does have significant natural resources, which would, in the context of better security and less corruption, be attractive to international business. There are several types of mineral available in substantial quantities, including copper, cobalt, coal and iron ore. There is also oil and gas and precious stones. One with particularly striking potential is lithium, a metal that is used in batteries for mobile devices and electric cars. The latter application is going to be especially important as the motor industry makes the transition to zero-carbon forms of transport. Back in 2010,a top US general told the New York Times,externalthat Afghanistan's mineral potential was ""stunning"" - with ""a lot of ifs, of course"". The paper also reported that an internal US Defence Department memo had said the country could become ""the Saudi Arabia of lithium"". Yet this undoubted potential is nowhere near being exploited - and the Afghan people have seen very little, if any, benefit from it. There have been many reports that China is keen to be involved. It seems to have better relations with the Taliban than Western powers do, so may have an advantage if the new regime does hold on to power. However, Chinese firms did win contracts to develop operations in copper and oil. But little happened. It is to be expected that China would be interested. The opportunities appear to be very substantial and the two countries do share a short border. But any Chinese agency - official or a business - would want to be confident of succeeding. They will be reluctant to commit unless they feel the security and corruption problems will be well enough contained to enable them to extract worthwhile quantities of these industrial commodities. A key question for any hard-nosed potential investors - from China or anywhere else - will be whether the Taliban is likely to be any more able than the previous Afghan government to create the kind of environment they need. Another factor likely to affect the economy is women's employment. In the past decade the percentage of the female population over 15 years of age in employment has risen dramatically, though at 22% in 2019 it was still low by international standards. Under the Taliban the change is likely to be reversed, further damaging economic prospects. In the immediate future, there is also a great deal of uncertainty about financial stability. Crowds of people have been trying to withdraw their money from the banks. The Pakistan-based Afghan Islamic Press reported a Taliban spokesman as offering assurances to bank owners, money changers, traders and shopkeepers that their lives and property would be protected. That there are even questions about the physical safety of financial operators is shocking. They do need to be confident if Afghanistan's financial system is to function.  But it also needs customers to feel their money is safe. That won't happen quickly. How much has the Afghanistan war cost? Kabul centre quiet and subdued after Taliban takeover Who are the Taliban?

UK blood supplies to be used for life-saving drug,"Trevor aged two, with his mum, Kes, pictured with her partner Luke, have both had immunoglobulin treatment Plasma from blood donations in England will be used to make a vital medicine, following a rule change to reduce reliance on imported stocks. Each year about 17,000 people need immunoglobulin treatment and, until recently, there was a ban on using plasma from UK â¯donors to safeguard against vCJD or ""mad cow disease"". Officials say this precaution isno longer necessary.,external A mother and son from the Wirral are among those to have had the treatment. Kes Earl, now 24, whose son Trevor is two, said: ""Immunoglobulins saved my family."" Donor plasma is used to make the medicine The move will help secure NHS plasma stocks to make the antibody-based medicines, called immunoglobulins. Rollout of the service will happen across England over the coming months, and NHS blood donor services elsewhere in the UK could opt to do the same. Currently, the UK relies solely on plasma imports, which can be in short supply - a situation made worse by Covid. Boy kept alive by blood plasma donations Gerry Gogarty, from NHS Blood and Transplant, welcomed the decision, calling it a huge step forward. ""By recovering plasma from blood donations, we can improve long-term supplies of immunoglobulin medicine, and each generous blood donation will go even further in helping to save the lives."" The red blood cells from donations will continue to be used as normal, so there will be no impact on donor blood stocks. Plasma is the fluid and other cells and components of whole blood. ""Your blood is mostly made up of plasma and it contains the antibodies which fight infections. Those antibodies can save the lives of people with faulty immune systems,"" he said. Trevor during his stay in intensive care Trevor was born with neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia - a dangerous condition caused by his mum's immune system attacking his blood. He received the urgent treatment in neonatal intensive care. Kes went on to have immunoglobulin herself during her second pregnancy, to prevent the same condition happening to her younger son Wyatt. ""Plasma is the reason I have two healthy little boys that keep me on my toes. I am so happy that plasma from blood donors is now being be used for immunoglobulins, to help make sure there's enough available,"" said Kes. The treatment can be used to help patients who cannot make antibodies themselves, or in circumstances where their bodies are not making enough antibodies, or the ones they are making don't work properly, as well as forâ¯disorders when the body's immune system is attackingâ¯itself.

"Covid testing is rip-off, says former regulator","PCR tests for travel have become ""a predictable Covid rip-off"", says the former chairman of the Competition and Markets Authority, Lord Tyrie. Lord Tyrie said the competition regulator had been ""too slow to react"" to complaints about testing providers. Holidaymakers have objected to high prices and poor service from many of the 400-plus test firms listed on the government's website. Tests cost about Â£75 on average, but prices can reach hundreds. Last week, Health Secretary Sajid Javid asked the CMA to investigate ""excessive"" pricing and ""exploitative practices"" among PCR Covid test firms. Initially, the CMA said it would take up to a month to report back. But after a chorus of objection from the travel industry, the CMA said it was reviewing the situation ""immediately"". Cost of NHS Covid tests for UK arrivals reduced Watchdog will look at Covid test cost immediately Anger at overflowing Covid test drop boxes Lord Tyrie told the BBC that the CMA ""could and should have been better prepared"". ""It should either be acting already directly using existing powers. Or if deemed inadequate for the job, it should be advising the government on how to obtain a quick remedy, whether by legislation or by other means,"" he said. ""This advice should already be with the government."" Lord Tyrie left the competition watchdog last summer after two years in the post, suggesting the role prevented him leading a more aggressive campaign for change. He added: ""The CMA acted much more quickly to quell price-gouging on hand sanitiser and other Covid-related products 18 months ago. Far from building on this success, boldness appears to have taken a back seat."" Lord Tyrie reflected that ""the CMA is full of able and highly motivated people, keen to tackle detriment like this"". ""Their energies need to be released from an excess of caution at the highest levels,"" he added. At the weekend, the cost of NHS coronavirus tests for international arrivals to the UK was reduced. Test and Trace tests were cut from Â£88 to Â£68 for people arriving from green-listed countries, as well as for those coming from amber-listed countries who are fully vaccinated. Meanwhile, the price of two tests for amber arrivals who have not had both jabs has been cut from Â£170 to Â£136. What are the holiday rules for travel to green, amber and red list countries? It is understood the price cut is an attempt to drive down the cost across the market, so other operators will follow. Criticism of the government's decision to implement PCR Covid testing for all UK arrivals has been significant from the travel sector. Last week, major airports including the Manchester Airport Group and Gatwick Airport, along with tour operator Tui, cited the testing policy as a major barrier to travel restarting and the industry recovering. The government said its top priority was to protect public health and it continued to work with industry to help them navigate this difficult period. Lord Tyrie said that the slow response of the CMA was likely to mean it was too late to offer a full remedy to the market before the peak holiday season comes to a close and people return to work and school in September. But the CMA said: ""These comments are inaccurate."" The watchdog said it gave advice to Department of Health and Social Care officials about the PCR testing market in April and ""we gave further advice to the secretary of state last week"". A spokesperson for the CMA said: ""We continue to work closely with Department of Health and Social Care in reviewing the market and, as we have made clear, we will not hesitate to take enforcement action ourselves if there are breaches of consumer law. ""Since the start of the pandemic, the CMA has secured hundreds of millions of pounds in refunds for people who have been treated unfairly, in sectors including holiday accommodation and package travel.""

"No need to swap data for drinks, says privacy body","Matt, Johnny and their friends are happy to use an app or queue at the bar: whichever is fastest Customers should think carefully about handing over personal data when ordering food and drink via their mobile phones, the UK's body overseeing data privacy suggests. App and web-based ordering has become commonplace during the pandemic. But the Information Commissioner's Office told the BBC that customers should be aware they had a choice over whether to share information. Venues should only ask for data that is ""relevant and necessary"", the ICO said. ""I think it's too easy to upload an app and straight away put your name, email address, payment details in, without actually understanding fully where that information may be shared and why it's being used,"" said Suzanne Gordon, director of data protection at the ICO. ""Ultimately this is your data, it's your personal information and you need to be confident when you're handing it over and the reasons why."" Online ordering is popular with many customers, sparing them the crush at the bar and helping to reduce the risk from Covid. But they're popular with businesses too, because they speed up the ordering process and provide an additional way to interact with customers. Apps now handle millions of pounds worth of transactions every day. And it looks as though they are here to stay. Apart from in Northern Ireland, where you still have to be served at the table, restaurants and bars across the UK can now return to pre-pandemic style service at the bar or from waiting staff. But most are keeping their online ordering too. How Covid turbocharged the QR revolution Is there a solution to the hospitality staff crisis? One group of friends, gathered for a drink in the sunshine at the Courtyard in Manchester, said they were happy either to use the app or to order at the bar, whichever would get their pint to them the fastest. But there were downsides to the apps, they admitted. ""You end up with 10 different passwords, I've got so many different apps,"" said Johnny. ""You give your postcode or your email, a lot of it seems irrelevant."" ""It is irrelevant,"" added Matt. ""But it's a cost we kind of have to pay."" But the ICO said sharing personal data was far from obligatory. ""Customers need to understand they do have a choice. We're now coming out of the pandemic and there's the ability to order on the app or in the more traditional way,"" said Ms Gordon. ""I think it is very easy for people just to see the end product, and because they want that, they really don't question the amount of data that they are being asked for,"" she added. The UK's four biggest pub chains, representing a quarter of the market - Wetherspoons, Greene King, Mitchells and Butlers and Stonegate - all now have their own in-house apps. The developers behind apps for independent venues say they have seen huge growth during the pandemic. They all say they follow the guidelines informing customers of their rights and how their data will be dealt with. But those terms and conditions are unlikely to be closely read by a lot of people. Over the last year, lots of businesses have suddenly got a mountain of information about their customers that they didn't have access to before. Your local knows your name, an email address, maybe your date of birth, maybe your home address. For the bar or pub, that's incredibly valuable information, worth much more than the round you just bought. It tells them what you like drinking, what time you're likely to visit, who you were sitting with and how frequently you reorder. Perhaps you're not bothered about the offers and discounts sent by them, but you might be more annoyed by calls from other companies, which could be in the small print of the app. Car insurance companies would be very interested in how much and how frequently you drink, while any number of other businesses would love to get hold of your mobile number. The law says you can always ask a company to stop sending you spam, but it's a lot easier to make sure you tick or untick the right boxes in the app to start with, or just put the phone down and order in person. Most apps work by charging a venue approximately 2% to 3% transaction charge per order. In return, the technology can help streamline the ordering process, but can also offer the chance to learn a little about customers' habits and profiles. ""Hospitality is struggling,"" says Luke Beavon, financial director at one of the independent app providers, GoodEats. ""But the app gives them the ability to follow up with a customer and get them back through the door again."" Once registered, ease of use makes it more likely that customers will have another drink or an additional item, according to Chris Dunkley, director of another independent app, Hopt. ""Hopt hugely increases spend-per-head for the operator,"" he said. However, hospitality firms that do use the new technology should respect some boundaries, said the ICO's Ms Gordon. ""If [firms] are asking for data, they need to understand why they are asking for it and they need to make sure it is relevant and necessary,"" she said. ""It's up to them to make sure it isn't excessive."" Alex Mackenzie and Sadra Hosseini, cofounders of ordering app Butlr, say they've reduced the amount of information it asks users to fill in The app developers appear to be taking that advice on board. The Courtyard, where Matt and Johnny are drinking, uses an app called Butlr, which accounts for about a third of the pub's orders, or more at weekends. But the amount of data the app collects has been reduced since it was first launched in 2018, says Butlr co-founder Alex Mackenzie. ""When we had our first venues go live, it was quite a rigorous sign-up process, but the data we collect from individuals has gradually worn away now,"" said Mr Mackenzie. ""We want to make it as simple and easy as possible."" Prask Sutton, chief executive of another app provider, Onvi, said the business kept ordering as simple as possible. ""We don't believe customers should have to hand over excessive personal information just to grab a pint at the pub. They're going for a drink, not applying for a mortgage.""

Parcel delivery texts now the most common con-trick,"The majority of ""smishing"" fraud attempts have come through the blitz of parcel delivery texts sent out during the Covid crisis. Millions of mobile users have received the texts that claim a small payment is needed for a package delivery to be completed. But the texts are a front for fraudsters attempting to steal personal banking details. Cybersecurity firm Proofpoint told banks their prevalence was on the rise. Smishing is a technique that criminals use to target consumers with texts impersonating trusted organisations. Proofpoint, which provided data for the banking trade body UK Finance, said that over a 90-day period to mid-July, some 53% of these smishing attempts were via delivery texts. This compared with 23% of messages claiming to be from banks or financial institutions. During the most recent 30-day period, some 67% of these scams were delivery text messages. Katy Worobec, managing director of economic crime at UK Finance, said:â¯ ""Criminals are experts at impersonating a range of organisations and have capitalised on the pandemic, knowing that many of us will be ordering goods online and awaiting parcel deliveries at home.â¯"" The text, claiming to be from Royal Mail or a delivery company arrives out of the blue and claims a parcel is awaiting delivery, but a small payment is required. Tom and Freyja Cuff were tricked out of their savings Tom and Freyja Cuff, from Frome, Somerset, received a text about a parcel collection which eventually led to their bank account being emptied of Â£2,500. Mr Cuff said that with online shopping being very common over lockdown, his wife ""didn't think anything of it"" and clicked on a link authorising a small payment of Â£2.50 to release the parcel. Mrs Cuff was then contacted again by the fraudsters, this time claiming to be from the couple's bank. She was told they wanted to move her money in order to protect it from being targeted further, but the couple's account - including savings for a new home - was then emptied. ""Basically someone funnelled all our money out, pretending to be the bank, and we were left with absolutely nothing. It was heartbreaking, horrendous,"" Mr Cuff said. The message then links to a website mocked up to look like an official site. The page requests personal and payment details, which scammers may use to steal someone's identity, or use to target them with other scams. The influencers promoting online scams Delivery text scams and how to deal with them Royal Mail said it would not use such texts - unless specifically requested - and would use a grey card instead to tell people if any fee was required. Laura Suter, personal finance analyst at AJ Bell, said: ""Everyone thinks they are smart enough to spot a scam text, but the messages have become so sophisticated that it's easy to be caught out. ""Lots of people will also see the text when they are in a hurry to receive their package or are rushing, so won't stop to think about whether it's legitimate or not.""

Abject England lose to India in final hour,"This video can not be played England v India: India win thrilling second Test in final hour Second LV= Insurance Test, Lord's (day five of five) India 364(Rahul 129, Anderson 5-62)& 298-8 dec(Rahane 61) England 391(Root 180*)& 120(Siraj 4-32) India won by 151 runs Scorecard England produced one of their worst home performances in recent memory to lose the second Test against India by 151 runs at Lord's. From a position where they started the final day as marginal favourites, England's bowling was flayed by the India tail before their batting capitulated to 120 all out. Mohammed Shami and Jasprit Bumrah - two genuine tailenders - shared a ninth-wicket stand of 89 in front of some raucous Indian support. Shami had reached 56 not out and Bumrah an unbeaten 34 when India declared on 298-8, setting England an unlikely 272 to win or 60 overs to survive. They instantly found themselves 1-2 after openers Rory Burns and Dom Sibley fell for ducks, and hope faded when Jonny Bairstow then, crucially, captain Joe Root were dismissed in the space of four balls separated by tea. This video can not be played England v India: Jasprit Bumrah removes Joe Root with Virat Kohli catch for 33 Jos Buttler, who faced 96 deliveries for 25, chewed up 16 overs with Moeen Ali and 12 with Ollie Robinson, either side of Sam Curran completing a king pair. However, Robinson and Buttler fell in successive overs, before Mohammed Siraj bowled last man James Anderson to end with 4-32 and put a rampant India 1-0 up with three Tests to play. I got tactics wrong in the field - Root Criticism from commentators fired up India tailenders - Kohli TMS podcast: India take victory on gripping final day Tuffers & Vaughan podcast: 'This series has just gone up a notch' Disappointing England Test performances have become commonplace, especially overseas. They have also been bowled out for85and67at home by Ireland and Australia respectively, but at least they won those matches. What makes this defeat so abject is the manner they threw away a genuine chance of victory, one which came after they were second best in the drawn first Test and allowed India to reach 276-3 on day one here. Their tactics during the Shami-Bumrah stand were completely baffling. Perhaps sucked in by the emotion of Anderson being peppered by Bumrah on the the third evening, England targeted the man rather than the stumps. By the time they changed the plan, it was too late. This video can not be played England v India: Reliance on Joe Root is embarrassing - Vaughan Not only that, but the fractious nature of the contest - there were numerous verbal exchanges between the two sides - seemed to galvanise India, while England wilted. Sure enough, when England came to bat to save the match on a pitch only showing an occasional sign of uneven bounce, they were blown away, much to the delight of the swathe of India fans inside a buzzing Lord's. England are now without a win in seven Tests and must find a response when the sides reconvene at Headingley on 25 August. India, on the other hand, will take some stopping. With India 181-6 overnight - 154 ahead - their hopes seemed to rest on the swashbuckling Rishabh Pant. That they could be taken to a declaration by Shami and Bumrah - men who averaged 11 and three respectively in Test cricket - is barely believable. This video can not be played England v India: Ollie Robinson claims wicket of Rishabh pant And yet, after Robinson had Pant caught behind for 22 and trapped Ishant Sharma lbw for three, England took leave of their cricketing senses, scattering the field and hardly producing a delivery aimed at the top of off stump. Although Bumrah began with some wild swipes, Shami was assured throughout. As England became increasingly frustrated, Bairstow dropped a half-chance at mid-wicket when Shami was on 31, while Root shelled a straightforward catch at slip off Moeen when Bumrah had 22. Shami went to his second Test half-century from 57 balls by hoisting Moeen over mid-wicket for six, both men reaching their highest scores. Overall, the ninth-wicket pair bumped along at 4.5 an over. By the time the declaration arrived in the second over after lunch, India were the only side with a realistic chance of victory, while England were absolutely scrambled. This video can not be played Mohammed Shami hits Moeen Ali for a four and a six to bring up half-century Given their fun with the bat and England's fragile batting, it was almost inevitable that Bumrah and Shami would do early damage. When Burns got a leading edge off Bumrah and Shami produced a devilish away-swinger to take Sibley's edge, it was the first time in an England home Test innings that both of their openers had fallen for ducks. Sibley must be in severe danger of being left out of the third Test. This video can not be played England v India: Mohammed Shami edges Dom Sibley for England's second duck Even the prolific Root, who made an unbeaten 180 in the first innings, could not save his team. He was caught at first slip off Bumrah in the first over after tea and England looked beaten. Although Buttler and Moeen battled, they still needed the fortune of Buttler being dropped by first slip Virat Kohli off Bumrah and Moeen being caught behind off a Ravindra Jadeja no-ball.

Ten days that shook Afghanistan,"The Taliban swept across Afghanistan in just 10 days, taking control of towns and cities across the country. Taliban fighters took their first provincial capital on 6 August - and by 15 August, they were at the gates of Kabul. Their lightning advance prompted tens of thousands of people to flee their homes, many arriving in the Afghan capital, others heading for neighbouring countries. And there was chaos in Kabul, as President Ashraf Ghani fled the country and thousands of his countrymen and women tried to do likewise. Emboldened by the withdrawal of US and other international forces, in June, the Taliban already controlled large parts of the country. But after 6 August, their advance accelerated with a new momentum. Provincial capitals toppled in quick succession. By 8 August, the Taliban had taken control in Kunduz. Herat, Lashkar Gah and Kandahar followed within a few days. Mapping the Taliban advance Who are the Taliban? Will the Taliban take Afghanistan back to the past? Despite 20 years of outside support, billions of dollars of funding, an extensive programme of training and US air support, the Afghan security forces largely collapsed. In some areas, they did stand and fight. In Lashkar Gah, Afghan troops were pinned back in key positions, as the Taliban attacked repeatedly. Hundreds of commandos were sent in to restore order - but when the Taliban detonated a massive car bomb outside the police headquarters, on 11 August, the battle was largely over. In many areas, Afghan units that found themselves running out of ammunition and other supplies simply fled. Troops armed and trained by the US to safeguard ordinary Afghans left them to largely fend for themselves. And in some places, the authorities agreed to allow the Taliban to take over, to avoid further bloodshed. In Ghazni, reports suggest the police chief and governor were both allowed to leave the city in return for agreeing to a Taliban takeover. On 14 August, Mazar-i-Sharif fell to the Taliban, with little resistance from Afghan troops, some of whom left the city and headed for the border with Uzbekistan at Haraitan. By the 15 August, 17,600 people fleeing the Taliban had arrived in Kabul, with thousands more arriving all the time, according to the UN's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. With very little support from the Afghan authorities, many were sleeping rough in parks and other public areas. Some said they had come from captured towns where the Taliban were killing male family members who had worked for the security forces, and reimposing restrictions on women. The World Food Programme said the conflict had ""all the hallmarks of a humanitarian catastrophe"". As President Ghani fled the country, US embassy staff were helicoptered out of their heavily fortified compound. And thousands of peoplewere heading to Kabul airport. This video can not be played Thousands of desperate Afghans descend on Kabul airport Taliban fighters initially paused outside the city, while emergency talks were held at the presidential palace. But they then moved in to take full control. Exactly how the Taliban intend to rule remains unclear - and may vary across the country. Reports from inside Taliban-held territory so far give a mixed picture. In Balkh, 20km (12 miles) from Mazar-i-Sharif,BBC Newsfound women and girls allowed in public areas unaccompanied - but there were reports of a woman being murdered because of the way she had dressed. In other places, including a rural northern district near the Tajik border, women have said they are now forced to cover themselves with a burka and cannot go out unaccompanied. There are also reports of young women being offered to Taliban fighters for forced marriage. Although, Taliban representatives in Qatar insist this is ""a lie"". From 9/11, to intense fighting on the ground, and now full withdrawal of US-led forces, hereâs what happened. 11 September 2001 Al-Qaeda, led by Osama Bin Laden in Afghanistan, carries out the largest terror attack ever conducted on US soil. Four commercial airliners are hijacked. Two are flown into the World Trade Centre in New York, which collapses. One hits the Pentagon building in Washington, and one crashes into a field in Pennsylvania. Nearly 3,000 people are killed. 7 October 2001 A US-led coalition bombs Taliban and al-Qaeda facilities in Afghanistan. Targets include Kabul, Kandahar and Jalalabad. The Taliban, who took power after a decade-long Soviet occupation was followed by civil war, refuse to hand over Bin Laden. Their air defences and small fleet of fighter aircraft are destroyed. 13 November 2001 The Northern Alliance, a group of anti-Taliban rebels backed by coalition forces, enters Kabul as the Taliban flee the city. By the 13 November 2001, all Taliban have either fled or been neutralised. Other cities quickly fall. 26 January 2004 After protracted negotiations at a “loya jirga” or grand assembly, the new Afghan constitution is signed into law. The constitution paves the way for presidential elections in October 2004. 7 December 2004 Hamid Karzai, the leader of the Popalzai Durrani tribe, becomes the first president under the new constitution. He serves two five-year terms as president. May 2006 British troops arrive in Helmand province, a Taliban stronghold in the south of the country. Their initial mission is to support reconstruction projects, but they are quickly drawn into combat operations. More than 450 British troops lose their lives in Afghanistan over the course of the conflict. 17 February 2009 US President Barack Obama approves a major increase in the number of troops sent to Afghanistan. At their peak, they number about 140,000. The so-called “surge” is modelled on US strategy in Iraq where US forces focussed on protecting the civilian population as well as killing insurgent fighters. 2 May 2011 The leader of al-Qaeda is killed in an assault by US Navy Seals on a compound in Abbottabad in Pakistan. Bin Ladenâs body is removed and buried at sea. The operation ends a 10-year hunt led by the CIA. Â The confirmation that Bin Laden had been living on Pakistani soil fuels accusations in the US that Pakistan is an unreliable ally in the war on terror. 23 April 2013 The founder of the Taliban, Mullah Mohammed Omar, dies. His death is kept secret for more than two years. According to Afghan intelligence, Mullah Omar dies of health problems at a hospital in the Pakistani city of Karachi. Pakistan denies that he was in the country. 28 December 2014 At a ceremony in Kabul, Nato ends its combat operations in Afghanistan. With the surge now over, the US withdraws thousands of troops. Â Most of those who remain focus on training and supporting the Afghan security forces. 2015 The Taliban launch a series of suicide attacks, car bombings and other assaults. The parliament building in Kabul, and the city of Kunduz are attacked. Islamic State militants begin operations in Afghanistan. 25 January 2019 Afghan President Ashraf Ghani says more than 45,000 members of his countryâs security forces have been killed since he became leader in 2014. The figure is far higher than previously thought. 29 February 2020 The US and the Taliban sign an “agreement for bringing peace” to Afghanistan, in Doha, Qatar. The US and Nato allies agree to withdraw all troops within 14 months if the militants uphold the deal. 13 April 2021 US president Joe Biden announces that all US troops will leave Afghanistan by 11 September 2021. 16 August 2021 In just over a month, the Taliban sweep across Afghanistan, taking control of towns and cities all over the country, including Kabul. Afghan security forces collapse in the face of the Taliban advance. Additional reporting by Matt Murphy Â© 2025 BBC.

Has Biden made a huge blunder?,"If you like neat lines, tidiness and admire symmetry, what's not to like about the decision of Joe Biden to pull American combat troops out of Afghanistan by 11 September 2021 - exactly 20 years on from 9/11? In modern day America it often feels that all roads lead back to 9/11; the single most defining - and scarring - event since Pearl Harbor: the surprise attack by the Japanese on America's Pacific fleet, which would ultimately bring America into World War Two. And so it was that 9/11 led to this country's longest military encounter. The attack on the Twin Towers, the plane that flew into the Pentagon, and the one that crashed into a field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, were initially the spur for a surge of US nationalism. Young people - in fact people of all ages - were going along to armed forces recruitment offices wanting to sign up. America had come under attack; these patriots wanted to fight to defend the country the ""land of the free"", and seek revenge on those who would do the US harm. And don't mistake this for some kind of kneejerk jingoism. It wasn't that. I knew many people - not just Americans - who were of a liberal bent and had been no great fans of all the doings of the US of A but who have a visceral sense this was a moment where you had to pick your team. Were you on the side of the rule of law, free and fair elections, due process, sexual equality, universal education? Or were you on the side of those who would fly planes into buildings, or would stone people to death, or throw homosexuals off of buildings, or deny girls schooling? If that seems a massive over-simplification, maybe it is - but in the devastating aftermath of 9/11, that is how it seemed to many. Biden makes a surprise visit to Afghanistan as vice-president in 2011 But by 2016 it was one of the factors that led to Donald Trump's election: the weariness of the ""endless wars"" as candidate Trump would refer to the quagmires of Afghanistan and Iraq; the wariness of America being able to act as the world's policeman. Americans understandably wanted to pull up the drawbridge, bring the troops home, leave it to the people in those countries to sort out their own problems, and finally give up on the idea that a US model of liberal democracy was an exportable commodity that could be imposed. The liberal interventionist crusade was over. Trump, if he had won last November, would have pulled out US troops, probably quicker. Although Joe Biden inherited Trump's promise to withdraw, in policy terms the easiest thing would have been to continue to sign the cheques to pay for American servicemen and women to stay in Afghanistan for another year. And then another. And another after that. Why the Taliban is gaining ground so quickly Fleeing the Taliban, to sleep on city streets The political pressure was by no means overwhelming. If anything, the reverse. The defence top brass, the foreign policy establishment, America's allies abroad thought anything other than the status quo would be reckless. But one question was gnawing at the new president, and it was the one posed by Hillel the Elder back in biblical times: ""If not now, then when?"" Biden - who advised President Barack Obama not to send more troops in 2009 but lost the argument - went with now, in what could be the most consequential single decision of his presidency. This video can not be played Taliban leaders speak to BBC News about conquer and compromise When 9/11 happened I was the BBC's Paris correspondent, reporting on Eurotunnel's attempt to force the closure of a Red Cross refugee centre called Sangatte  - where many of the world's storm-tossed refugees and migrants congregated before making the final leg of the journey to the UK. I was driving to Calais when I got a call from a colleague telling me to stop at the nearest service station to watch TV, and see what was unfolding. We didn't know what would happen next - or where we would end up. One year into the optimism of a new millennium, there was a narrative and it wasn't a happy one - the war on terror, a clash of civilisations, call it what you will. At the time the two stories could not have been more different, but a lot of the bedraggled people we met on the roads around Calais were from Afghanistan fleeing Taliban rule. It's worth remembering why the US, UK and others went into Afghanistan. The Taliban had - in effect - become a finishing school for Islamist terrorists wanting to wage jihad against the west. Al-Qaeda wannabes were going into the country to train for holy war. The 9/11 terrorists had honed their skills and hatched their plot there. Removing the Taliban and tackling al-Qaeda became critical for global security. Within a few weeks of 9/11, I was in northern Afghanistan, travelling via Delhi and then Dushanbe in Tajikistan to get there. We were moving with the US and UK-backed Northern Alliance troops as they pushed the Taliban out. Ousting the Taliban was considered a global priority 20 years ago, writes the author (right) Our first day was spent travelling from Khoja Bahauddin, then the Northern Alliance HQ along a road where the Taliban had killed a number of journalists in an ambush two days earlier. After one night we ended up in a town called Taleqan. It had fallen the night before we arrived. One of the iconic shots was of a girls-school classroom that had become a weapons dump for Taliban rockets that in their hasty retreat they had left behind. The stubborn last stronghold was Kunduz - a vital communication corridor sitting between Kabul, Mazar-i-Sharif and then further north to the border with Uzbekistan. Now both Taleqan and Kunduz have come back under Taliban control, with a third of the country's regional capitals now under their control. And that raises a super-uncomfortable question for Joe Biden and his ""if not now, then when"" policy. Twenty years on and so many lives lost, and so many billions of dollars spent, what was it for? What's been achieved? What do you say to the families of all those servicemen killed by the Taliban now that the US is giving up? What's to stop terror groups from re-establishing their jihad training camps? At the UN Security Council hearing last Friday it was reported that up to 20 different terror groups, involving thousands of foreign fighters were already fighting with Taliban forces. The regions where Jon travelled are now back under Taliban control I'm sure as I am writing this more families will be packing up their possessions fearful of what Taliban control will mean, perhaps heading to Calais and then the UK. Will the girls' schools return to become weapons storage facilities again? The scars of 9/11 are clear everywhere - thousands of servicemen have come back with prosthetic limbs and disturbed minds. Suicide rates have been rising. Families have lost loved ones. On America's streets are men with red plastic beer cups begging for loose change, many of them with signs saying they are veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan. US-led forces toppled the Taliban:In 2001 US-led forces overthrew Afghanistan's Taliban rulers after the 9/11 attacks masterminded by al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, who was based there. Twenty years of occupation and military operations followed:The US and allies oversaw elections and built up Afghan security forces, but the Taliban continued to launch attacks. Eventually the US made a deal with the Taliban:They would pull out if the militants agreed not to host terrorist groups. But talks between the Taliban and the Afghan government failed. US-led forces withdrew this year and the Taliban have now retaken most of the country. The desire to stay at home and shut yourself away from a troubling world is completely understandable. There is no surprise that ""America First"" as a slogan had such resonance. George W Bush was not advocating that back in 2001 - but there were no US troops in Afghanistan or Iraq then. And that didn't keep America safe when early that morning, across those gin-clear blue skies passenger aeroplanes were hijacked and became al-Qaeda-guided missiles, flying into their targets killing thousands of people doing nothing more provocative than going about their daily lives. There's also a difference between enforcing your will as the world's policeman, and being a peacekeeper. Thousands of American troops are still stationed in South Korea - even though the Korean war was 70 years ago. The calculation of successive US presidents has been that a tense peace is better than a hot war or a destabilised region. Joe Biden was hoping his decision would result in headlines like ""Afghan War Ends"" or ""America's longest war is over"". But 20 years on, and the Taliban now re-establishing control with all that could flow from that, might historians in future judge that the 20th anniversary marked the start of the second Afghan war?

Jeff Bezos's space firm sues Nasa over SpaceX deal,"Mr Bezos flew to space with his brother Mark (L) in July, in the first crewed flight of his New Shepard spacecraft Jeff Bezos's space firm Blue Origin is suing Nasa over a decision to award a $2.9bn (Â£2.1bn) lunar lander contract to Elon Musk's SpaceX. The former Amazon boss's firm said there were ""fundamental issues"" with the deal, calling it unfair. The row stems from a decision in April to hand the deal to one company, not two as expected, because of a funding shortfall. Nasa is yet to comment, but it has the backing of a federal watchdog. In a court filing on Friday, Blue Origin said it continued to believe that two providers were needed to build the landing system, which will carry astronauts down to the Moon's surface as early as 2024. It also accused Nasa of ""unlawful and improper evaluation"" of its proposals during the tender process. Bezos' $2bn offer to get back in race to the Moon ""We firmly believe that the issues identified in this procurement and its outcomes must be addressed to restore fairness, create competition and ensure a safe return to the Moon for America,"" Blue Origin said. At the time of the award, Nasa's human exploration chief, Kathy Lueders, admitted that the space agency's current budget precluded it from selecting two companies. That was after Congress granted it only $850m of the $3.3bn it requested for the project. Nasa also cited the proven record of orbital missions by Elon Musk's SpaceX firm as a factor in the award. Cost is also thought to have played a role: SpaceX's bid was the lowest-priced by some distance. In July, Mr Bezos offered to cover up to $2bn of Nasa's costs in order to be reconsidered for the contract, but he was rebuffed. US watchdog the Government Accountability Office (GAO), meanwhile, rejected a complaint from Blue Origin and defence contractor Dynetic, saying that Nasa had not ""acted improperly"" in handing the contract to just one firm. Nasa must file a response to the legal action by 12 October. SpaceX is yet to comment on the lawsuit. Under its Artemis programme, Nasa hopes to return humans to the moon for the first time since 1972. In April, Ms Lueders said: ""This critical step puts humanity on a path to sustainable lunar exploration and keeps our eyes on missions farther into the solar system, including Mars.""

UK defence giant Ultra agrees to Â£2.6bn takeover,"Ultra Electronics, a major supplier to the Royal Navy, has agreed to be bought by US-owned Cobham in a Â£2.6bn takeover being monitored by the UK government. Cobham said it would ""offer legally binding and enforceable commitments to HM Government"" over the Ultra deal. These include security issues and protecting UK jobs. Defence and aerospace company Cobham was controversially bought by US private equity firm Advent in 2019 despite national security concerns. ""We look forward to working with HM Government, and other relevant stakeholders, to agree legally binding commitments which safeguard Ultra's contribution to the UK economy and national security,"" said Shonnel Malani, chairman of the Cobham Group. The UK's Business Secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, was reported to be considering launching a national security investigation into the deal last month under the Enterprise Act. The act gives the government the power to intervene in mergers on public interest grounds covering national security. Government could intervene in Meggitt takeover UK defence firm bid monitored by government However, the Enterprise Act will be superseded from January next year by the new National Security and Investment Act, which aims to impose more stringent safeguards on foreign ownership of British companies. The new act will introduce stronger powers of intervention if there are concerns about national security issues in any takeovers. It will also have a wider remit covering 17 business sectors and will probe any investments of more than 25% in a UK company that cause concern. Crucially, it could be used retrospectively to fine firms. As part of its takeover of Ultra - which has two sites in Dorset - Cobham said its commitments would cover ""safeguarding and supporting the UK's national security"" including national security clearance arrangements. It has also pledged to protect existing and create new UK manufacturing and engineering jobs, and to increase investment in research and development (R&D) in the UK. Lord West of Spithead, who served as First Sea Lord, has also raised concerns about the Cobham-Ultra deal and a similar one involving British defence supplier Meggitt. Meggitt announced it had agreed a Â£6.3bn takeover by Ohio-based Parker Hannifin earlier this month but then revealed it was the subject to an unsolicited Â£7bn bid approach from US firm TansDigm. On Monday,it gave shareholders notice of a vote,externalon the recommended Park Hannifin deal on 17 September. TransDigm has now been given a deadline of 14 September by the UK Takeover Panel to make a formal offer for Meggitt. Meggitt's chairman, Sir Nigel Rudd, called on ministers to block a takeover if any bidder tries to buy it without giving binding commitments on investment and jobs. He told the Sunday Times,externalthat while ""clearly, price is important"", any new owner would need to give Meggitt and the government undertakings, including to keep the company's headquarters in Coventry and maintain R&D spending. Meggitt specialises in components for the aerospace, defence and energy industries. Companies that it supplies include Airbus and BAE Systems, but it also has contracts with the Ministry of Defence that Parker Hannifin has pledged to honour. There has been a number of sales of UK defence sector businesses to US firms, ahead of the probable Ultra and Meggitt deals. This month Frazer-Nash Consultancy, a defence engineering consultancy working on Britain's nuclear submarines and weaponry for the Royal Navy, was sold by UK's Babcock International to US group KBR for Â£293m.

Today's updates have been brought to you by Mary O'Connor, Francesca Gillett, Rob Corp, James Clarke and Julian Joyce. We'll be back with more coronavirus coverage tomorrow. We'll be bringing our coronavirus coverage to a close shortly. Here's a round-up of what's been happening: The pandemic has been tough on many people. Among them is Massimo Felici, who owns three restaurants in the Staten Island borough of New York City. Trade has started to recover but he says a new challenge now looms: New York's City's vaccine mandate. Starting this week, customers and staff must prove that they've had at least one dose of a vaccine to enter indoor venues such as restaurants, gyms and theatres. Many have welcomed the move at time of surging infections in the city, but business owners like Massimo are scared. ""This could destroy my business,"" he says. ""There are too many people who are unvaccinated."" ""Right now it's summer, so it's not too bad to eat outside. But soon it will be really cold. A lot of people are going to get fed up and leave."" You can read more here. Almost 620,000 Americans have died from Covid-19, and over 32 million have contracted the virus. Healthcare workers have been on the frontline in the battle against Covid-19. The BBC has talked to several healthcare professionals - doctors, nurses, and medical staff - who reporters initially spoke to last summer - toask how they are faring nearly 18 months into the pandemic. Idara Inokon, 32, from New York, says ""a lot has happened"" in her life since last April. She says she was ""burnt out"" after working as an intensive care nurse at the pandemic's height in New York and began desperately craving a change of scenery. ""So, I picked a city in Texas that I'd never been to, and accepted a travel nurse contract in El Paso at the end of summer 2020,"" she says. But what began as a fun experience soon transformed into ""another Covid nightmare"", she says, when El Paso became an ""epicentre"" for the virus as it ripped through whole households. By 2021, she had accepted a nurse practitioner job working in vaccine clinics across New York City, spending four months on ""the other side"", which she says felt ""less stressful and more hopeful"". ""Instead of witnessing the tragic stories of Covid, I was met with the smiles of people excited to get vaccinated, who had hopes of moving toward a new kind of normal."" She says it has been heartbreaking to hear about the pressure on staff and hospitals as Covid cases rise, adding it was a ""bit unnerving to see hospitals overwhelmed at the end of summer before flu season even starts"". Idara adds she is most concerned about online misinformation about coronavirus vaccines and Covid-19, as it could ""stifle efforts to curb the continued spread of Covid"". Hugh PymBBC News Health Editor The former Prime Minister Gordon Brown has called for urgent
action by Joe Biden, Boris Johnson and the G20 chair Mario Draghi to end what
he calls âthis vaccine inequality that shames the worldâ. Brown has previously criticised G7 leaders for failing, in
his view, to announce more radical policies for global vaccine distribution at
their summit in June. Now he says his own research reveals that this month and
next month 10 million vaccine doses made at a South African factory for Johnson
& Johnson will be exported to the European Union. The EU has agreed, he
says, that from October all African-produced vaccines should stay in
Africa. But he argues this should have been implemented immediately
and brands the situation as an example of attitudes in developing nations that are âshocking, unfair and bordering on the neo-colonialâ. Brown goes on to
say delays mean only 30% of adults in Africa will be guaranteed
vaccination by next summer, about half the current rate now in wealthy
economies. A government spokesperson says the UK is committed to
improving access to vaccines and 100 million surplus doses will be donated
within the next year, with the first delivered last week.  The daily figures on coronavirus in the UKhave been released by the government,,externalshowing that a further 28,438 cases have been picked up in the UK. In the past three weeks, daily cases have varied between 21,000 and 33,000. A further 26 deaths have also been announced today. While the number of deaths are often lower on a Monday because of reporting delays, today's figure is less than the 37  last Monday. The latest numbers on vaccination show that 77% of adults in the UK have now had both doses of a jab, while very nearly nine in 10 - 89.5% - have had their first dose. Japan's rebound came as spending by individuals and businesses bounced back from the initial impact of the coronavirus Official figures show Japan's economy grew faster than expected from its pandemic-driven slump in the run-up to the Tokyo Olympics. Japan - which is the world's third-largest economy - grew at twice the rate forecast in April to June. But analysts have said growth will be modest this quarter after a state of emergency was reimposed to ease a spike in Covid-19 infections Tokyo, Saitama and Chiba are all in a state of emergency, while one has been requested by another of Japan's prefectures, Shizuoka. Japan's recovery remains much slower than has been seen in other advanced economies such as the US. More on this story here. President Muhammadu Buhari was in the UK for two weeks Nigeria's President Mohammadu Buhari has gone into self-isolation on arrival from the UK. This comes after the country's high commission in London was closed last week for 10 days after some staff tested positive for coronavirus. The president's office said his isolation was in line with guidelines for international arrivals. There are reports that the president was in close contact with the high commission officials who tested positive for coronavirus. President Buhari was in the UK for a global education summit and medical check-up. Nigeria has been reporting a rise in Covid-19 infections. A 91-year-old care home resident was surprised with a re-enactment of her granddaughter's wedding day after she was unable to attend the nuptials due to Covid restrictions. Audrey Dear missed Holly's wedding to partner Steve Kennedy so staff at the Weald Heights care home in Sevenoaks, Kent, brought a version of the ceremony to her. They filled the care home with balloons and decorations and everyone enjoyed an afternoon tea. To add to the surprise, the new Mrs Kennedy's gown included a cutting from her grandmother's own wedding dress. Maria Covington, the care home's manager, said it had been ""incredibly hard keeping the plans a secret, but it was worth it to see her surprise when Holly and Steve arrived in their wedding attire"". ""Audrey had a wonderful afternoon surrounded by her close family. ""This was a very emotive and happy occasion that brought joy to a very special grandmother."" Travel agent says when he was ""pinged"" it was a ""bit of a disaster"" for his business We've been in the market town of Woodbridge in Suffolk, asking the small businesses there how they're feeling now the self-isolation rules have changed. From today, people no longer need to self-isolate if they come into contact with a positive case. Last month, there were mass staff shortages and firms struggled as hundreds of thousands of people were told to self-isolate. Travel agent Lee Hunt says the change in guidance is a ""step in the right direction"". ""The travel industry is really struggling anyway, so when I was pinged and we were running on just one person a day, we were having to close early, open late, do half days and there's a good chance we lost bookings and business because of that. ""We are only working on two staff members at the moment so [the change] gives me confidence that we are not going to need to unexpectedly take time off and we can roster, and it is good for those on the high street, too, and hopefully it will increase footfall.""

It says it is reviewing reports of suspected side effects of menstrual disorders and unexpected vaginal bleeding following a Covid vaccine. But it makes clear the evidence seen so far does not support a link between changes to menstrual periods and the vaccines - and the number of reports about menstrual disorders and vaginal bleeding is low in relation to the number of people vaccinated. And it adds: ""The menstrual changes reported are mostly transient in nature. ""There is no evidence to suggest that Covid-19 vaccines will affect fertility and the ability to have children."" But it says any woman who, since getting the vaccine, sees persistent changes to her periods that are unusual, or has any new vaginal bleeding after the menopause, should contact their doctor. ""The MHRA continues to closely review reports of suspected side effects of menstrual disorders and unexpected vaginal bleeding,"" it says. It also reassures pregnant women who are worried about getting the vaccine, saying there is no pattern to suggest any of vaccines increase the risk of miscarriage, stillbirth, congenital anomalies or birth complications. More from the MHRA's website here.,external People in England may need to prove they are fully vaccinated to go to nightclubs and some other venues in England from the end of September. The government has said that's the plan - although we are still waiting for the final details.

Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst People wearing protective face masks walk during evening rush hour in Beijing Ahead of the new school year, local governments
in China are deciding whether to allow students back into the classroom. In the cities of Beijing and Wuhan nurseries and primary schools can reopen from 1 September. However, in the eastern city of Zhengzhou, whichrecently experienced severe flooding, students will have to learn online. âSchools
will be reopenedâ¦ if no new cases are recorded for 14 consecutive days,â the
Global Times newspaper says. In southwestern Yunnan and eastern Shandong
province, teachers and students must undergo 14 days of
self-quarantine before they start back at school. Global Times says that many students will âbe
strictly checked with their 'health code' when they register and return to
schoolâ. This is a digital QR code that is linked to a smart
phone ownerâs medical history. In Taiwan, cases have all but vanished after a
huge outbreak that began in May. However, according to the Taiwan News website,
all nursery, school and university students will be required to wear masks in
northern Taipei â one of the islandâs Covid-19 hotspots - when they return on 1
September.  Nearly 120,000 people under 30 in Wales have still not taken up their first vaccine dose, according to data from Public Health Wales. Senior Welsh doctor David Bailey, a GP and head of the Welsh part of the British Medical Association, has said there needs to be a push to jab that age group. ""That will reduce not just transmission, but also of course, serious illness, which will mean the NHS can get on with the massive backlog we've got to deal with over the next three or four years,"" said the Caerphilly doctor. Bailey said he accepted the risks of becoming critically ill from Covid were fewer for young people, but that there were still overwhelming benefits of vaccination. ""Certainly, the evidence at the moment suggests that younger people are more likely to get long Covid, even though they are much less likely to die,"" he said. More here. Emlyn Begley, BBC Sport It was the weekend Premier League fans had been waiting more than 17 months for - and it did not disappoint. We saw full stadiums for the first time since the Covid pandemic shut football down in March 2020, the traditional 3pm fixtures were back and there were a near-record number of goals. ""It is amazing. It changes everything. Two or three months ago, something was missing,"" said Spurs boss Nuno Espirito Santo after their1-0 win over Manchester City. ""The games were good but the fans are what it is all about - the edge of the game, and the boys need it."" He is not wrong. Football behind closed doors - with fake crowd noise on the TV and radio - has just not been the same. Last season, there were a few weeks with 2,000 fans allowed at some games in the winter, before two weeks of larger crowds at the end of the campaign, plus trials at Wembley in the FA Cup and Carabao Cup. But full stadiums are back now. The roar from the 16,479 at the first-ever Premier League game to be played at Brentford - Friday's win over Arsenal - will live long in the memory. A crowd of 72,732 packed into Old Trafford to watch Manchester United hammer Leeds. Everton striker Dominic Calvert-Lewin, who scored against Southampton, said: ""It's a great feeling to score with fans being back in the stadium. I felt like a kid again."" And Trevoh Chalobah's goal on his Premier League debut - and hisemotional reaction- would not have been the same without his fellow Chelsea fans in the stands to celebrate with him. Read more from Emlyn here. We've heard about some of the unusual venues that have been transformed into vaccination centres - including mosques, stadiums and London's Science Museum. Now a former John Lewis store - which closed permanently in June - will become Aberdeen's main coronavirus vaccination centre. Most of the city's vaccinations so far have been taking place at the TECA/P&J Live events complex to the north-west of Aberdeen. But now, with restrictions easing, that complex can resume hosting concerts and conferences. The Ideal Home exhibition will be its first public event since the pandemic began, when it takes place next month. The full story is here. The changes to self-isolation rules have already been implemented in Scotland and Wales The rules on self-isolation are changing in England and Northern Ireland today, meaning if you're fully vaccinated you no longer have to quarantine if you come into contact with a person with Covid. Instead, you're advised to take a test. But the doctors' union the British Medical Association says we're still in a ""very precarious situation"", adding ""we strongly urge the public to remain cautious and take sensible precautions"". The BMA urges people to follow the guidance and take a PCR test if they come into close contact with a positive case. Dr Penelope Toff from the BMA says the government now needs to focus on ""greater efforts to increase vaccine uptake in the population, especially among younger adults and eligible adolescents, as well as revisiting policies to make infection control measures mandatory again in public settings"". The guidance for health and care workers who come into contact with a positive case is already stricter - while they don't have to isolate, they're advised to take daily lateral flow tests for 10 days.

It was decided during its meeting with the national and Tokyo governments, as well as the International Paralympic Committee. The move was widely expected as Japan continues to see a surge in Covid-19 cases. Shortly before the announcement, the government has also proposed to expand the country's state of emergency to include seven other prefectures, while extending it for Tokyo and others until 12 September. But the officials say school children will be allowed to attend the Paralympic Games if local authorities or school administrators request it. The Olympics were also largely held without spectators.

Anger after deadly petrol tank blast in Lebanon,"The explosion occurred as soldiers handed out fuel seized from alleged black marketeers Protesters attacked the home of Lebanon's prime minister-designate after a petrol tank explosion killed 27 people and injured 79 others on Sunday. Dozens of demonstrators demanded Najib Mikati's resignation, threw stones at his house and clashed with police. Mr Mikati said he understood ""the cries of people"" but condemned what he called the ""unacceptable vandalism"". The army said the explosion occurred as soldiers handed out petrol seized from black marketeers in the Akkar region. The cause of the blast was not clear, but a large crowd was gathered around the tank at the time, it added. The health minister said seven of the injured were in a critical condition in hospital ""We were informed that the army was distributing gasoline... so people flocked to fill it in plastic containers,"" Marwa al-Sheikh, whose brother Ismail was badly burned on his arms and legs, told AFP news agency. She said some witnesses had told her that the explosion happened after someone used a lighter, but that others had claimed that shots were fired. ""The dead are victims of a careless state,"" she added. Caretaker Prime Minister Hassan Diab - whose government resigned after the devastating explosion in Beirut a year ago but has not been replaced because of political deadlock - called the explosion a ""tragic catastrophe"" and declared a national day of mourning for Monday. The army said it was investigating the circumstances that led to the blast and had arrested the owner of the land in the town of al-Tleil where the tank was located. Locals also reportedly set fire to his house. A doorway of the building in Beirut where Najib Mikati lives was broken during the protest Fuel is scarce in Lebanon, which is in the grips of one of the world's worst economic crises in modern times. The currency has collapsed over the past two years, causing inflation to skyrocket, and more than half of the population live below the poverty line. Last week, the central bank unilaterally decided to end fuel subsidies because of its dwindling reserves of foreign currency. The government condemned the move and said fuel prices must not change. Security forces began on Saturday to distribute fuel allegedly being hoarded by petrol stations and by individuals in tanks like the one in Akkar. This video can not be played Lebanonâs descent into darkness Much of Lebanon relies on private generators and the fuel shortages have left many people and institutions with just two hours of electricity a day.

Pingdemic: 'We got close to complete shutdown',"One of the world's largest brake pad manufacturers came close to shutting down production due to staff shortages caused by the so-called pingdemic. Tom Russell of TMD Friction said 15% of UK staff had to isolate at one point after being pinged by the NHS app. However, Mr Russell is one of many business bosses relieved with the changes to self-isolation rules. The new rulesmean fully-vaccinated people do not have to isolate if they come into contact with a positive case. Mr Russell said the changes, which apply to people in England and Northern Ireland, would have a ""massive impact"" on the business. The UK operations manager for TMD Friction said out of the 15% of staff who were isolating after being pinged by the NHS app, 40% were in the firm's maintenance teams, which led to a backlog of machines needing to be repaired. Self-isolation ends for double-jabbed and under-18s How are the self-isolation rules changing? ""It didn't get too far too far away from that to be honest (complete shutdown),"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""There were a couple of points particularly with the maintenance team where we had a backlog of machines that we couldn't get repaired quickly enough because we didn't have the maintenance staff."" Tom Russell said it had been hard to keep operations going because of staff shortages Mr Russell said the so-called pingdemic ""created a awful lot of stress and heartache for people that were coming to work, but equally for those at home unable to work for reasons that they couldn't particularly understand"". Staff being forced to stay at home to look after children who had been sent home from school to isolate also caused further shortages, he added. ""When you have got people going off isolating at a moment's notice it's very difficult to try and react and keep operations balance, so definitely this change will have a massive impact, positively,"" Mr Russell said. Staff shortages caused by the pingdemic had dealt a further blow to businesses already struggling amid the Covid pandemic. At its peak in July, the number of self-isolation alerts sent in England and Wales in a week was just under 700,000. Supermarket chain Iceland said that after keeping all of its stores open during lockdown, it had to shut some last month because 1,000 staff had been ""pinged"" by the NHS app. The rule changes on isolation, which came into effect on Monday, also apply to under-18s. The changes to self-isolation rules have already been implemented in Scotland and Wales. Instead of having to quarantine for 10 days, people are now advised to take a PCR test, but it is not compulsory. Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UK Hospitality,tweeted,externalthat the new rules, together with the change in app sensitivity, would ""help reduce the impact of the pingdemic"". However, she added: ""With 60% of hospitality workers under 30 we still need test to release."" Alethea Fynn is a nursery manager at London Early Years Foundation and has had to deal with staff absences as a result of the pingdemic. ""It's been very difficult because from day to day you don't know who is going to be pinged and how many staff it's going to affect, and even what bubble it's going to affect,"" she said. ""Staff could come to work and at a lunch time they will come back to you and tell you they have been pinged so they would have to go home."" Ms Fynn said there had been ""quite a few closures"" across the network of nurseries because of staff being pinged by the app. ""The rules being relaxed has come at a good time for us. It means that a whole bubble or a nursery shouldn't be closed,"" she added. Ralph Findlay, chief executive of pub chain Marstons, said the rule changes were a ""very sensible move"" and would make a ""big difference"". ""This has been quite a big challenge over recent weeks. I think it is welcome in the sector,"" he said. Mr Findlay added that, on average, the company's 1,400 pubs had returned to trading at pre-pandemic levels. Mike Cherry, the national chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said the rule changes would come as a ""relief"" to companies. However, while Michael Kill, chief executive of the Night Time Industries Association, agreed the changes in rules were a ""positive step forward"", he added that they were ""in many ways too little too late"". ""We are lobbying the government for a more liberal system which will look at a mechanism of Test & Release, which will certainly help the balance between public health and challenging staffing shortages faced by the sector at the moment.""

Japan's economy bounced back ahead of the Olympics,"Japan rebounded faster than expected from its pandemic-driven slump in the run-up to the Tokyo Olympics. Official figures show the world's third-largest economy grew at twice the rate forecast in April to June. But analysts have warned growth will be modest this quarter after a state of emergency was reimposed to ease a spike in Covid-19 infections. Meanwhile, new data also shows that the economic recovery of its larger neighbour, China, is losing steam. Preliminary data show Japan's gross domestic product (GDP) grew by an annualised 1.3% in the second quarter of the year. That came after a 3.7% slump in the previous three months. The latest figures were far better than the expected gain of 0.7% and came as spending by individuals and businesses bounced back from the initial impact of the coronavirus. However, Japan's recovery remains much slower than has been seen in other advanced economies like the US, which recorded a 6.5% jump in GDP for the second quarter of the year. Japan's relatively weak rebound highlights how the government has struggled to contain the pandemic. ""I have very mixed feelings about this GDP result,"" Economy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura said after the data was released. ""Our priority is to prevent the spread of the virus. It's very bad for the economy for this situation to drag on,"" he added. In 2020, Japan's economy shrank by more than 4.8% over the year, its first contraction in more than a decade. The country's economy emerged from last year's initial blow from the pandemic thanks to robust exports, although the slow rollout of its vaccination programme and a series of state of emergency measures have hurt consumption. At the same time a spike in cases of the Delta variant in other parts of Asia has further disrupted supply chains for some Japanese manufacturers. This could hurt factory output and threaten the already fragile recovery. In Tokyo, Japan's benchmark Nikkei share index closed 1.6% lower on Monday, its third session of losses in a row. Meanwhile, in China factory output and retail sales both rose more slowly than expected last month, compared to a year ago. It is the latest sign that the recovery of the world's second-largest economy is losing steam as export growth cools and new Covid-19 outbreaks disrupt business.

LiveLiveCovid isolation rules change for England and NI10 minutes ago,"The UK records another 28,438 coronavirus cases - and a further 26 deaths within 28 days of a positive test People in England and Northern Ireland who have had two Covid jabs will now not have to isolate for 10 days if they have contact with a positive case They are instead advised to take a PCR test, wear a face covering in enclosed spaces and limit contact with other people - especially the clinically vulnerable People who test positive or show symptoms will still be legally required to self isolate for 10 days Doctors' union the British Medical Association urges people to remain cautious as rules change, saying we're still in a ""precarious situation"" UK medicines regulator the MHRA says evidence seen so far does not suggest a link between vaccines and changes to menstrual patterns The Tokyo Paralympics will go ahead without spectators as Japan continues to see a surge in Covid cases The government has said 16 and 17-year-olds in England will offered their first Covid jab or the chance to book one by 23 August Edited by James Clarke That's all from us for now. Today's updates have been brought to you by Mary O'Connor, Francesca Gillett, Rob Corp, James Clarke and Julian Joyce. We'll be back with more coronavirus coverage tomorrow. We'll be bringing our coronavirus coverage to a close shortly. Here's a round-up of what's been happening: The pandemic has been tough on many people. Among them is Massimo Felici, who owns three restaurants in the Staten Island borough of New York City. Trade has started to recover but he says a new challenge now looms: New York's City's vaccine mandate. Starting this week, customers and staff must prove that they've had at least one dose of a vaccine to enter indoor venues such as restaurants, gyms and theatres. Many have welcomed the move at time of surging infections in the city, but business owners like Massimo are scared. ""This could destroy my business,"" he says. ""There are too many people who are unvaccinated."" ""Right now it's summer, so it's not too bad to eat outside. But soon it will be really cold. A lot of people are going to get fed up and leave."" You can read more here. Almost 620,000 Americans have died from Covid-19, and over 32 million have contracted the virus. Healthcare workers have been on the frontline in the battle against Covid-19. The BBC has talked to several healthcare professionals - doctors, nurses, and medical staff - who reporters initially spoke to last summer - toask how they are faring nearly 18 months into the pandemic. Idara Inokon, 32, from New York, says ""a lot has happened"" in her life since last April. She says she was ""burnt out"" after working as an intensive care nurse at the pandemic's height in New York and began desperately craving a change of scenery. ""So, I picked a city in Texas that I'd never been to, and accepted a travel nurse contract in El Paso at the end of summer 2020,"" she says. But what began as a fun experience soon transformed into ""another Covid nightmare"", she says, when El Paso became an ""epicentre"" for the virus as it ripped through whole households. By 2021, she had accepted a nurse practitioner job working in vaccine clinics across New York City, spending four months on ""the other side"", which she says felt ""less stressful and more hopeful"". ""Instead of witnessing the tragic stories of Covid, I was met with the smiles of people excited to get vaccinated, who had hopes of moving toward a new kind of normal."" She says it has been heartbreaking to hear about the pressure on staff and hospitals as Covid cases rise, adding it was a ""bit unnerving to see hospitals overwhelmed at the end of summer before flu season even starts"". Idara adds she is most concerned about online misinformation about coronavirus vaccines and Covid-19, as it could ""stifle efforts to curb the continued spread of Covid"". Hugh PymBBC News Health Editor The former Prime Minister Gordon Brown has called for urgent
action by Joe Biden, Boris Johnson and the G20 chair Mario Draghi to end what
he calls âthis vaccine inequality that shames the worldâ. Brown has previously criticised G7 leaders for failing, in
his view, to announce more radical policies for global vaccine distribution at
their summit in June. Now he says his own research reveals that this month and
next month 10 million vaccine doses made at a South African factory for Johnson
& Johnson will be exported to the European Union. The EU has agreed, he
says, that from October all African-produced vaccines should stay in
Africa. But he argues this should have been implemented immediately
and brands the situation as an example of attitudes in developing nations that are âshocking, unfair and bordering on the neo-colonialâ. Brown goes on to
say delays mean only 30% of adults in Africa will be guaranteed
vaccination by next summer, about half the current rate now in wealthy
economies. A government spokesperson says the UK is committed to
improving access to vaccines and 100 million surplus doses will be donated
within the next year, with the first delivered last week.  The daily figures on coronavirus in the UKhave been released by the government,,externalshowing that a further 28,438 cases have been picked up in the UK. In the past three weeks, daily cases have varied between 21,000 and 33,000. A further 26 deaths have also been announced today. While the number of deaths are often lower on a Monday because of reporting delays, today's figure is less than the 37  last Monday. The latest numbers on vaccination show that 77% of adults in the UK have now had both doses of a jab, while very nearly nine in 10 - 89.5% - have had their first dose. Japan's rebound came as spending by individuals and businesses bounced back from the initial impact of the coronavirus Official figures show Japan's economy grew faster than expected from its pandemic-driven slump in the run-up to the Tokyo Olympics. Japan - which is the world's third-largest economy - grew at twice the rate forecast in April to June. But analysts have said growth will be modest this quarter after a state of emergency was reimposed to ease a spike in Covid-19 infections Tokyo, Saitama and Chiba are all in a state of emergency, while one has been requested by another of Japan's prefectures, Shizuoka. Japan's recovery remains much slower than has been seen in other advanced economies such as the US. More on this story here. President Muhammadu Buhari was in the UK for two weeks Nigeria's President Mohammadu Buhari has gone into self-isolation on arrival from the UK. This comes after the country's high commission in London was closed last week for 10 days after some staff tested positive for coronavirus. The president's office said his isolation was in line with guidelines for international arrivals. There are reports that the president was in close contact with the high commission officials who tested positive for coronavirus. President Buhari was in the UK for a global education summit and medical check-up. Nigeria has been reporting a rise in Covid-19 infections. A 91-year-old care home resident was surprised with a re-enactment of her granddaughter's wedding day after she was unable to attend the nuptials due to Covid restrictions. Audrey Dear missed Holly's wedding to partner Steve Kennedy so staff at the Weald Heights care home in Sevenoaks, Kent, brought a version of the ceremony to her. They filled the care home with balloons and decorations and everyone enjoyed an afternoon tea. To add to the surprise, the new Mrs Kennedy's gown included a cutting from her grandmother's own wedding dress. Maria Covington, the care home's manager, said it had been ""incredibly hard keeping the plans a secret, but it was worth it to see her surprise when Holly and Steve arrived in their wedding attire"". ""Audrey had a wonderful afternoon surrounded by her close family. ""This was a very emotive and happy occasion that brought joy to a very special grandmother."" Travel agent says when he was ""pinged"" it was a ""bit of a disaster"" for his business We've been in the market town of Woodbridge in Suffolk, asking the small businesses there how they're feeling now the self-isolation rules have changed. From today, people no longer need to self-isolate if they come into contact with a positive case. Last month, there were mass staff shortages and firms struggled as hundreds of thousands of people were told to self-isolate. Travel agent Lee Hunt says the change in guidance is a ""step in the right direction"". ""The travel industry is really struggling anyway, so when I was pinged and we were running on just one person a day, we were having to close early, open late, do half days and there's a good chance we lost bookings and business because of that. ""We are only working on two staff members at the moment so [the change] gives me confidence that we are not going to need to unexpectedly take time off and we can roster, and it is good for those on the high street, too, and hopefully it will increase footfall.""

It says it is reviewing reports of suspected side effects of menstrual disorders and unexpected vaginal bleeding following a Covid vaccine. But it makes clear the evidence seen so far does not support a link between changes to menstrual periods and the vaccines - and the number of reports about menstrual disorders and vaginal bleeding is low in relation to the number of people vaccinated. And it adds: ""The menstrual changes reported are mostly transient in nature. ""There is no evidence to suggest that Covid-19 vaccines will affect fertility and the ability to have children."" But it says any woman who, since getting the vaccine, sees persistent changes to her periods that are unusual, or has any new vaginal bleeding after the menopause, should contact their doctor. ""The MHRA continues to closely review reports of suspected side effects of menstrual disorders and unexpected vaginal bleeding,"" it says. It also reassures pregnant women who are worried about getting the vaccine, saying there is no pattern to suggest any of vaccines increase the risk of miscarriage, stillbirth, congenital anomalies or birth complications. More from the MHRA's website here.,external People in England may need to prove they are fully vaccinated to go to nightclubs and some other venues in England from the end of September. The government has said that's the plan - although we are still waiting for the final details. You can download the pass via theNHS app,external(not theNHS Covid-19 app,external), if you are registered with a GP. You can also get itvia the NHS website.,external Once you are logged in, you can select ""domestic"" and ""travel"" pass options. Travel is if you need to prove your vaccination status to travel abroad. The system generates a QR code, which lasts for 28 days. You can also requestan NHS Covid Pass letter,externalby calling 119. This only shows vaccination status and has no expiry date. Under-16s can't get an NHS Covid Pass, because most children of this age aren't being vaccinated.

Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst People wearing protective face masks walk during evening rush hour in Beijing Ahead of the new school year, local governments
in China are deciding whether to allow students back into the classroom. In the cities of Beijing and Wuhan nurseries and primary schools can reopen from 1 September. However, in the eastern city of Zhengzhou, whichrecently experienced severe flooding, students will have to learn online. âSchools
will be reopenedâ¦ if no new cases are recorded for 14 consecutive days,â the
Global Times newspaper says. In southwestern Yunnan and eastern Shandong
province, teachers and students must undergo 14 days of
self-quarantine before they start back at school. Global Times says that many students will âbe
strictly checked with their 'health code' when they register and return to
schoolâ. This is a digital QR code that is linked to a smart
phone ownerâs medical history. In Taiwan, cases have all but vanished after a
huge outbreak that began in May. However, according to the Taiwan News website,
all nursery, school and university students will be required to wear masks in
northern Taipei â one of the islandâs Covid-19 hotspots - when they return on 1
September.  Nearly 120,000 people under 30 in Wales have still not taken up their first vaccine dose, according to data from Public Health Wales. Senior Welsh doctor David Bailey, a GP and head of the Welsh part of the British Medical Association, has said there needs to be a push to jab that age group. ""That will reduce not just transmission, but also of course, serious illness, which will mean the NHS can get on with the massive backlog we've got to deal with over the next three or four years,"" said the Caerphilly doctor. Bailey said he accepted the risks of becoming critically ill from Covid were fewer for young people, but that there were still overwhelming benefits of vaccination. ""Certainly, the evidence at the moment suggests that younger people are more likely to get long Covid, even though they are much less likely to die,"" he said. More here. Emlyn Begley, BBC Sport It was the weekend Premier League fans had been waiting more than 17 months for - and it did not disappoint. We saw full stadiums for the first time since the Covid pandemic shut football down in March 2020, the traditional 3pm fixtures were back and there were a near-record number of goals. ""It is amazing. It changes everything. Two or three months ago, something was missing,"" said Spurs boss Nuno Espirito Santo after their1-0 win over Manchester City. ""The games were good but the fans are what it is all about - the edge of the game, and the boys need it."" He is not wrong. Football behind closed doors - with fake crowd noise on the TV and radio - has just not been the same. Last season, there were a few weeks with 2,000 fans allowed at some games in the winter, before two weeks of larger crowds at the end of the campaign, plus trials at Wembley in the FA Cup and Carabao Cup. But full stadiums are back now. The roar from the 16,479 at the first-ever Premier League game to be played at Brentford - Friday's win over Arsenal - will live long in the memory. A crowd of 72,732 packed into Old Trafford to watch Manchester United hammer Leeds. Everton striker Dominic Calvert-Lewin, who scored against Southampton, said: ""It's a great feeling to score with fans being back in the stadium. I felt like a kid again."" And Trevoh Chalobah's goal on his Premier League debut - and hisemotional reaction- would not have been the same without his fellow Chelsea fans in the stands to celebrate with him. Read more from Emlyn here. We've heard about some of the unusual venues that have been transformed into vaccination centres - including mosques, stadiums and London's Science Museum. Now a former John Lewis store - which closed permanently in June - will become Aberdeen's main coronavirus vaccination centre. Most of the city's vaccinations so far have been taking place at the TECA/P&J Live events complex to the north-west of Aberdeen. But now, with restrictions easing, that complex can resume hosting concerts and conferences. The Ideal Home exhibition will be its first public event since the pandemic began, when it takes place next month. The full story is here. The changes to self-isolation rules have already been implemented in Scotland and Wales The rules on self-isolation are changing in England and Northern Ireland today, meaning if you're fully vaccinated you no longer have to quarantine if you come into contact with a person with Covid. Instead, you're advised to take a test. But the doctors' union the British Medical Association says we're still in a ""very precarious situation"", adding ""we strongly urge the public to remain cautious and take sensible precautions"". The BMA urges people to follow the guidance and take a PCR test if they come into close contact with a positive case. Dr Penelope Toff from the BMA says the government now needs to focus on ""greater efforts to increase vaccine uptake in the population, especially among younger adults and eligible adolescents, as well as revisiting policies to make infection control measures mandatory again in public settings"". The guidance for health and care workers who come into contact with a positive case is already stricter - while they don't have to isolate, they're advised to take daily lateral flow tests for 10 days.

It was decided during its meeting with the national and Tokyo governments, as well as the International Paralympic Committee. The move was widely expected as Japan continues to see a surge in Covid-19 cases. Shortly before the announcement, the government has also proposed to expand the country's state of emergency to include seven other prefectures, while extending it for Tokyo and others until 12 September. But the officials say school children will be allowed to attend the Paralympic Games if local authorities or school administrators request it. The Olympics were also largely held without spectators.

The influencers promoting online scams,"On social media, there's a new type of influencer. But instead of promoting clothing lines and lifestyle products, they promote fraud. They flash stacks of cash, hide their faces, and some even lure new recruits by selling guides on committing fraud. You'd think these scammers and their illegal products would be hard to find, and once upon a time, they were, hidden in the shadows of the dark web. But not any more. As part of an investigation for BBC Panorama, I discovered just how easy it was to make deals with fraudsters and purchase fraud guides online.

And they all rely heavily on something known as fullz, slang for full information. These are the personal details of an unconnected person: typically an individual's name, phone number, address and bank details. With the fullz in hand, fraudsters can follow the steps in the guides to make online purchases or even take out a loan in someone else's name.

A bad credit score can have life-changing implications: it affects your chances of applying for a loan, or getting a mortgage, or even opening a new bank account.

I posed as someone interested in learning about fraud and messaged Tankz about his methods via Instagram. We bought his top guide for Â£100.

One clip also featured a distinctive black-and-grey carpet, and we were able to find a match on a website advertising student accommodation in the Wembley area.

We discovered an email sent from Tankz's official address which also made a reference to the same name. There was even an eBay account under the name of Tankz, where Luke Joseph is the contact address. Finally, we discovered that there was someone of the same name living in the same student accommodation block in Wembley. It seems that Tankz may be a London student called Luke Joseph. We contacted Luke Joseph, and Tankz, but we didn't get a response. His TikTok, Instagram and Snapchat accounts were removed by the respective social media platforms after Panorama notified them about the content. Since then, he has created a new TikTok account where he continues to post about his life. So what are the wider authorities doing to crack down on online fraud and those who promote it?

Today's updates have been brought to you by Mary O'Connor, Francesca Gillett, Rob Corp, James Clarke and Julian Joyce. We'll be back with more coronavirus coverage tomorrow. We'll be bringing our coronavirus coverage to a close shortly. Here's a round-up of what's been happening: The pandemic has been tough on many people. Among them is Massimo Felici, who owns three restaurants in the Staten Island borough of New York City. Trade has started to recover but he says a new challenge now looms: New York's City's vaccine mandate. Starting this week, customers and staff must prove that they've had at least one dose of a vaccine to enter indoor venues such as restaurants, gyms and theatres. Many have welcomed the move at time of surging infections in the city, but business owners like Massimo are scared. ""This could destroy my business,"" he says. ""There are too many people who are unvaccinated."" ""Right now it's summer, so it's not too bad to eat outside. But soon it will be really cold. A lot of people are going to get fed up and leave."" You can read more here. Almost 620,000 Americans have died from Covid-19, and over 32 million have contracted the virus. Healthcare workers have been on the frontline in the battle against Covid-19. The BBC has talked to several healthcare professionals - doctors, nurses, and medical staff - who reporters initially spoke to last summer - toask how they are faring nearly 18 months into the pandemic. Idara Inokon, 32, from New York, says ""a lot has happened"" in her life since last April. She says she was ""burnt out"" after working as an intensive care nurse at the pandemic's height in New York and began desperately craving a change of scenery. ""So, I picked a city in Texas that I'd never been to, and accepted a travel nurse contract in El Paso at the end of summer 2020,"" she says. But what began as a fun experience soon transformed into ""another Covid nightmare"", she says, when El Paso became an ""epicentre"" for the virus as it ripped through whole households. By 2021, she had accepted a nurse practitioner job working in vaccine clinics across New York City, spending four months on ""the other side"", which she says felt ""less stressful and more hopeful"". ""Instead of witnessing the tragic stories of Covid, I was met with the smiles of people excited to get vaccinated, who had hopes of moving toward a new kind of normal."" She says it has been heartbreaking to hear about the pressure on staff and hospitals as Covid cases rise, adding it was a ""bit unnerving to see hospitals overwhelmed at the end of summer before flu season even starts"". Idara adds she is most concerned about online misinformation about coronavirus vaccines and Covid-19, as it could ""stifle efforts to curb the continued spread of Covid"". Hugh PymBBC News Health Editor The former Prime Minister Gordon Brown has called for urgent
action by Joe Biden, Boris Johnson and the G20 chair Mario Draghi to end what
he calls âthis vaccine inequality that shames the worldâ. Brown has previously criticised G7 leaders for failing, in
his view, to announce more radical policies for global vaccine distribution at
their summit in June. Now he says his own research reveals that this month and
next month 10 million vaccine doses made at a South African factory for Johnson
& Johnson will be exported to the European Union. The EU has agreed, he
says, that from October all African-produced vaccines should stay in
Africa. But he argues this should have been implemented immediately
and brands the situation as an example of attitudes in developing nations that are âshocking, unfair and bordering on the neo-colonialâ. Brown goes on to
say delays mean only 30% of adults in Africa will be guaranteed
vaccination by next summer, about half the current rate now in wealthy
economies. A government spokesperson says the UK is committed to
improving access to vaccines and 100 million surplus doses will be donated
within the next year, with the first delivered last week.  The daily figures on coronavirus in the UKhave been released by the government,,externalshowing that a further 28,438 cases have been picked up in the UK. In the past three weeks, daily cases have varied between 21,000 and 33,000. A further 26 deaths have also been announced today. While the number of deaths are often lower on a Monday because of reporting delays, today's figure is less than the 37  last Monday. The latest numbers on vaccination show that 77% of adults in the UK have now had both doses of a jab, while very nearly nine in 10 - 89.5% - have had their first dose. Japan's rebound came as spending by individuals and businesses bounced back from the initial impact of the coronavirus Official figures show Japan's economy grew faster than expected from its pandemic-driven slump in the run-up to the Tokyo Olympics. Japan - which is the world's third-largest economy - grew at twice the rate forecast in April to June. But analysts have said growth will be modest this quarter after a state of emergency was reimposed to ease a spike in Covid-19 infections Tokyo, Saitama and Chiba are all in a state of emergency, while one has been requested by another of Japan's prefectures, Shizuoka. Japan's recovery remains much slower than has been seen in other advanced economies such as the US. More on this story here. President Muhammadu Buhari was in the UK for two weeks Nigeria's President Mohammadu Buhari has gone into self-isolation on arrival from the UK. This comes after the country's high commission in London was closed last week for 10 days after some staff tested positive for coronavirus. The president's office said his isolation was in line with guidelines for international arrivals. There are reports that the president was in close contact with the high commission officials who tested positive for coronavirus. President Buhari was in the UK for a global education summit and medical check-up. Nigeria has been reporting a rise in Covid-19 infections. A 91-year-old care home resident was surprised with a re-enactment of her granddaughter's wedding day after she was unable to attend the nuptials due to Covid restrictions. Audrey Dear missed Holly's wedding to partner Steve Kennedy so staff at the Weald Heights care home in Sevenoaks, Kent, brought a version of the ceremony to her. They filled the care home with balloons and decorations and everyone enjoyed an afternoon tea. To add to the surprise, the new Mrs Kennedy's gown included a cutting from her grandmother's own wedding dress. Maria Covington, the care home's manager, said it had been ""incredibly hard keeping the plans a secret, but it was worth it to see her surprise when Holly and Steve arrived in their wedding attire"". ""Audrey had a wonderful afternoon surrounded by her close family. ""This was a very emotive and happy occasion that brought joy to a very special grandmother."" Travel agent says when he was ""pinged"" it was a ""bit of a disaster"" for his business We've been in the market town of Woodbridge in Suffolk, asking the small businesses there how they're feeling now the self-isolation rules have changed. From today, people no longer need to self-isolate if they come into contact with a positive case. Last month, there were mass staff shortages and firms struggled as hundreds of thousands of people were told to self-isolate. Travel agent Lee Hunt says the change in guidance is a ""step in the right direction"". ""The travel industry is really struggling anyway, so when I was pinged and we were running on just one person a day, we were having to close early, open late, do half days and there's a good chance we lost bookings and business because of that. ""We are only working on two staff members at the moment so [the change] gives me confidence that we are not going to need to unexpectedly take time off and we can roster, and it is good for those on the high street, too, and hopefully it will increase footfall.""

It says it is reviewing reports of suspected side effects of menstrual disorders and unexpected vaginal bleeding following a Covid vaccine. But it makes clear the evidence seen so far does not support a link between changes to menstrual periods and the vaccines - and the number of reports about menstrual disorders and vaginal bleeding is low in relation to the number of people vaccinated. And it adds: ""The menstrual changes reported are mostly transient in nature. ""There is no evidence to suggest that Covid-19 vaccines will affect fertility and the ability to have children."" But it says any woman who, since getting the vaccine, sees persistent changes to her periods that are unusual, or has any new vaginal bleeding after the menopause, should contact their doctor. ""The MHRA continues to closely review reports of suspected side effects of menstrual disorders and unexpected vaginal bleeding,"" it says. It also reassures pregnant women who are worried about getting the vaccine, saying there is no pattern to suggest any of vaccines increase the risk of miscarriage, stillbirth, congenital anomalies or birth complications. More from the MHRA's website here.,external People in England may need to prove they are fully vaccinated to go to nightclubs and some other venues in England from the end of September. The government has said that's the plan - although we are still waiting for the final details. You can download the pass via theNHS app,external(not theNHS Covid-19 app,external), if you are registered with a GP. You can also get itvia the NHS website.,external Once you are logged in, you can select ""domestic"" and ""travel"" pass options. Travel is if you need to prove your vaccination status to travel abroad. The system generates a QR code, which lasts for 28 days. You can also requestan NHS Covid Pass letter,externalby calling 119. This only shows vaccination status and has no expiry date. Under-16s can't get an NHS Covid Pass, because most children of this age aren't being vaccinated.

Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst People wearing protective face masks walk during evening rush hour in Beijing Ahead of the new school year, local governments
in China are deciding whether to allow students back into the classroom. In the cities of Beijing and Wuhan nurseries and primary schools can reopen from 1 September. However, in the eastern city of Zhengzhou, whichrecently experienced severe flooding, students will have to learn online. âSchools
will be reopenedâ¦ if no new cases are recorded for 14 consecutive days,â the
Global Times newspaper says. In southwestern Yunnan and eastern Shandong
province, teachers and students must undergo 14 days of
self-quarantine before they start back at school. Global Times says that many students will âbe
strictly checked with their 'health code' when they register and return to
schoolâ. This is a digital QR code that is linked to a smart
phone ownerâs medical history. In Taiwan, cases have all but vanished after a
huge outbreak that began in May. However, according to the Taiwan News website,
all nursery, school and university students will be required to wear masks in
northern Taipei â one of the islandâs Covid-19 hotspots - when they return on 1
September.  Nearly 120,000 people under 30 in Wales have still not taken up their first vaccine dose, according to data from Public Health Wales. Senior Welsh doctor David Bailey, a GP and head of the Welsh part of the British Medical Association, has said there needs to be a push to jab that age group. ""That will reduce not just transmission, but also of course, serious illness, which will mean the NHS can get on with the massive backlog we've got to deal with over the next three or four years,"" said the Caerphilly doctor. Bailey said he accepted the risks of becoming critically ill from Covid were fewer for young people, but that there were still overwhelming benefits of vaccination. ""Certainly, the evidence at the moment suggests that younger people are more likely to get long Covid, even though they are much less likely to die,"" he said. More here. Emlyn Begley, BBC Sport It was the weekend Premier League fans had been waiting more than 17 months for - and it did not disappoint. We saw full stadiums for the first time since the Covid pandemic shut football down in March 2020, the traditional 3pm fixtures were back and there were a near-record number of goals. ""It is amazing. It changes everything. Two or three months ago, something was missing,"" said Spurs boss Nuno Espirito Santo after their1-0 win over Manchester City. ""The games were good but the fans are what it is all about - the edge of the game, and the boys need it."" He is not wrong. Football behind closed doors - with fake crowd noise on the TV and radio - has just not been the same. Last season, there were a few weeks with 2,000 fans allowed at some games in the winter, before two weeks of larger crowds at the end of the campaign, plus trials at Wembley in the FA Cup and Carabao Cup. But full stadiums are back now. The roar from the 16,479 at the first-ever Premier League game to be played at Brentford - Friday's win over Arsenal - will live long in the memory. A crowd of 72,732 packed into Old Trafford to watch Manchester United hammer Leeds. Everton striker Dominic Calvert-Lewin, who scored against Southampton, said: ""It's a great feeling to score with fans being back in the stadium. I felt like a kid again."" And Trevoh Chalobah's goal on his Premier League debut - and hisemotional reaction- would not have been the same without his fellow Chelsea fans in the stands to celebrate with him. Read more from Emlyn here. We've heard about some of the unusual venues that have been transformed into vaccination centres - including mosques, stadiums and London's Science Museum. Now a former John Lewis store - which closed permanently in June - will become Aberdeen's main coronavirus vaccination centre. Most of the city's vaccinations so far have been taking place at the TECA/P&J Live events complex to the north-west of Aberdeen. But now, with restrictions easing, that complex can resume hosting concerts and conferences. The Ideal Home exhibition will be its first public event since the pandemic began, when it takes place next month. The full story is here. The changes to self-isolation rules have already been implemented in Scotland and Wales The rules on self-isolation are changing in England and Northern Ireland today, meaning if you're fully vaccinated you no longer have to quarantine if you come into contact with a person with Covid. Instead, you're advised to take a test. But the doctors' union the British Medical Association says we're still in a ""very precarious situation"", adding ""we strongly urge the public to remain cautious and take sensible precautions"". The BMA urges people to follow the guidance and take a PCR test if they come into close contact with a positive case. Dr Penelope Toff from the BMA says the government now needs to focus on ""greater efforts to increase vaccine uptake in the population, especially among younger adults and eligible adolescents, as well as revisiting policies to make infection control measures mandatory again in public settings"". The guidance for health and care workers who come into contact with a positive case is already stricter - while they don't have to isolate, they're advised to take daily lateral flow tests for 10 days.

It was decided during its meeting with the national and Tokyo governments, as well as the International Paralympic Committee. The move was widely expected as Japan continues to see a surge in Covid-19 cases. Shortly before the announcement, the government has also proposed to expand the country's state of emergency to include seven other prefectures, while extending it for Tokyo and others until 12 September. But the officials say school children will be allowed to attend the Paralympic Games if local authorities or school administrators request it. The Olympics were also largely held without spectators.

"Canada's Trudeau calls snap summer electionAs Prime Minister Justin Trudeau goes to the polls two years early, here's what you need to know.","Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has called a snap summer general election as Canada enters into its pandemic fourth wave. The general election comes as polls indicate his minority Liberal government looks within reach of forming a majority. The 49-year-old Liberal leader says ""Canadians need to choose how we finish the fight against Covid-19"". Canadians will vote on 20 September, some two years ahead of schedule. On Sunday, Mr Trudeau visited Canada's Governor General Mary Simon - the representative of the Queen, Canada's head of state - and asked her to dissolve Parliament. The leader of the centrist Liberals said a general election was necessary so voters have a voice on the path forward at a ""pivotal moment"". In October 2019, voters handed him a minority, meaning he has had to rely on opposition parties to help him pass his agenda. Opposition parties criticised the Liberals for calling a five-week long campaign during the pandemic's latest wave simply for ""political gain"". ""Politically, I don't really know if there's been a better time for this government,"" says Abacus Data CEO David Coletto. ""The mood of the public is a good one right now."" The pollster says that about 46% of Canadians in their recent surveys say they believe the country is heading in the right direction - the highest it's been in about five years. The global coronavirus pandemic is sure to dominate the campaign, as it has much of Mr Trudeau's second term. Over 25.000 Canadians have died from Covid, but the country fared better than others, such as the US. Still, its record on the pandemic has been mixed. It was slow to close its borders. The military had to be sent to some elderly care homes to help contain outbreaks. The initial vaccine rollout was slow, with Mr Trudeau facing questions over the lack of domestic vaccine production. The government was quick to get pandemic relief spending out the door, though it racked up record levels of debt to do so. Is Torontoâs lockdown one of the world's longest? While the country is entering another pandemic wave, for the moment it seems life is returning slowly to normal. Cases rates remain below last winter's peak. Vaccine supply sped up and now Canada has one of the world's highest vaccination rates. The economy is showing signs of recovery and provinces are cautiously reopening. ""This crisis in some ways has been positive for  [Mr Trudeau], politically,"" says Drew Fagan, professor at the Munk School of Global Affairs and Public Policy at the University of Toronto. But he says the question is whether ""there's enough momentum there"" to ""get him from a fairly healthy minority government to a slim majority government"". Canada has a fixed election date law and the next vote was scheduled for October 2023. But minority governments, which are not uncommon in the country, tend to last about two years. They can be defeated if they lose a vote of confidence in the House of Commons. Those votes are usually on important pieces of legislation like the federal budget. Or like what happened on Sunday, a prime minister can ask the governor general to formally dissolve Parliament - a request rarely denied. In 2019, months of political scandals, a tough first term and a bumpy campaign where old photos of him in blackface emerged all took a toll on the prime minister's popularity. The Liberals won 157 seats, 13 shy of a majority in the 338 seat House of Commons-  and he lost the popular vote. It was also a sharp turnaround from 2015, when he swept into office as a political fresh face and led his party to a stunning win with 184 seats. It will be both a referendum on Mr Trudeau's handling of the pandemic and a vote on future plans to the recovery. Affordability and cost of living are also at the forefront of voters' minds. Lytton broke heat record in July, before a wildfire devastated the British Columbia town Climate change will be front-and-centre, against a backdrop of the province of British Columbia's summer of devastating heatwaves and wildfires, and with parts of the Prairies experiencing severe drought. Mr Coletto says almost half Canadians say the environment is in their top five concerns, up from 39% two years ago. Why North America's killer heat scares me US-Canada heatwave: Visual guide to the causes Mr Trudeau's government also made two big announcements late last week - a promise to accept up to 20,000 Afghan refugees and a vaccine mandate for federal workers and air and rail travellers. The Conservative leader, Erin O'Toole, has championed vaccines but opposes vaccine mandates in favour of other measures and has been vague on whether all candidates will be required to have the jabs. Vaccine mandates could prove to be a campaign wedge issue, says Mr Coletto. ""Our tracking shows that more and more of [vaccinated Canadians] over time are more open to putting restrictions on what people who are not vaccinated can and cannot do,"" he says. The official opposition, the right-leaning Conservatives, are going into the election as perceived underdogs. Their new leader, Mr O'Toole, 48, is not well known to voters. After the party struggled with social and environmental issues in the last election, he's been trying to broaden its appeal, speaking about his support for LGBT rights and introducing a carbon pricing plan early on. On Sunday, he pitched voters on fiscal responsibility and promised economic growth. Still, they are now at ""anything but at a high water mark"", says Mr Fagan. On the left, NDP leader Jagmeet Singh, 42, will be entering his second campaign with surveys suggesting his popularity among voters is higher than in 2019. Mr Fagan says the party's message for progressives will be a vote for the NDP is ""vote for the real thing"". Quebec's separatist party, the Bloc QuÃ©bÃ©cois, which competes only in that battleground province, is also still popular in the province where they hold 32 seats.

Japan's economy bounced back ahead of the OlympicsAnalysts have warned recovery will be modest this quarter after a state of emergency was re-imposed.,"Japan rebounded faster than expected from its pandemic-driven slump in the run-up to the Tokyo Olympics. Official figures show the world's third-largest economy grew at twice the rate forecast in April to June. But analysts have warned growth will be modest this quarter after a state of emergency was reimposed to ease a spike in Covid-19 infections. Meanwhile, new data also shows that the economic recovery of its larger neighbour, China, is losing steam. Preliminary data show Japan's gross domestic product (GDP) grew by an annualised 1.3% in the second quarter of the year. That came after a 3.7% slump in the previous three months. The latest figures were far better than the expected gain of 0.7% and came as spending by individuals and businesses bounced back from the initial impact of the coronavirus. However, Japan's recovery remains much slower than has been seen in other advanced economies like the US, which recorded a 6.5% jump in GDP for the second quarter of the year. Japan's relatively weak rebound highlights how the government has struggled to contain the pandemic. ""I have very mixed feelings about this GDP result,"" Economy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura said after the data was released. ""Our priority is to prevent the spread of the virus. It's very bad for the economy for this situation to drag on,"" he added. In 2020, Japan's economy shrank by more than 4.8% over the year, its first contraction in more than a decade. The country's economy emerged from last year's initial blow from the pandemic thanks to robust exports, although the slow rollout of its vaccination programme and a series of state of emergency measures have hurt consumption. At the same time a spike in cases of the Delta variant in other parts of Asia has further disrupted supply chains for some Japanese manufacturers. This could hurt factory output and threaten the already fragile recovery. In Tokyo, Japan's benchmark Nikkei share index closed 1.6% lower on Monday, its third session of losses in a row. Meanwhile, in China factory output and retail sales both rose more slowly than expected last month, compared to a year ago. It is the latest sign that the recovery of the world's second-largest economy is losing steam as export growth cools and new Covid-19 outbreaks disrupt business.

LiveLiveSelf-isolation rules change for England and NI11 minutes ago,"The UK records another 28,438 coronavirus cases - and a further 26 deaths within 28 days of a positive test People in England and Northern Ireland who have had two Covid jabs will now not have to isolate for 10 days if they have contact with a positive case They are instead advised to take a PCR test, wear a face covering in enclosed spaces and limit contact with other people - especially the clinically vulnerable People who test positive or show symptoms will still be legally required to self isolate for 10 days Doctors' union the British Medical Association urges people to remain cautious as rules change, saying we're still in a ""precarious situation"" UK medicines regulator the MHRA says evidence seen so far does not suggest a link between vaccines and changes to menstrual patterns The Tokyo Paralympics will go ahead without spectators as Japan continues to see a surge in Covid cases The government has said 16 and 17-year-olds in England will offered their first Covid jab or the chance to book one by 23 August Edited by James Clarke That's all from us for now. Today's updates have been brought to you by Mary O'Connor, Francesca Gillett, Rob Corp, James Clarke and Julian Joyce. We'll be back with more coronavirus coverage tomorrow. We'll be bringing our coronavirus coverage to a close shortly. Here's a round-up of what's been happening: The pandemic has been tough on many people. Among them is Massimo Felici, who owns three restaurants in the Staten Island borough of New York City. Trade has started to recover but he says a new challenge now looms: New York's City's vaccine mandate. Starting this week, customers and staff must prove that they've had at least one dose of a vaccine to enter indoor venues such as restaurants, gyms and theatres. Many have welcomed the move at time of surging infections in the city, but business owners like Massimo are scared. ""This could destroy my business,"" he says. ""There are too many people who are unvaccinated."" ""Right now it's summer, so it's not too bad to eat outside. But soon it will be really cold. A lot of people are going to get fed up and leave."" You can read more here. Almost 620,000 Americans have died from Covid-19, and over 32 million have contracted the virus. Healthcare workers have been on the frontline in the battle against Covid-19. The BBC has talked to several healthcare professionals - doctors, nurses, and medical staff - who reporters initially spoke to last summer - toask how they are faring nearly 18 months into the pandemic. Idara Inokon, 32, from New York, says ""a lot has happened"" in her life since last April. She says she was ""burnt out"" after working as an intensive care nurse at the pandemic's height in New York and began desperately craving a change of scenery. ""So, I picked a city in Texas that I'd never been to, and accepted a travel nurse contract in El Paso at the end of summer 2020,"" she says. But what began as a fun experience soon transformed into ""another Covid nightmare"", she says, when El Paso became an ""epicentre"" for the virus as it ripped through whole households. By 2021, she had accepted a nurse practitioner job working in vaccine clinics across New York City, spending four months on ""the other side"", which she says felt ""less stressful and more hopeful"". ""Instead of witnessing the tragic stories of Covid, I was met with the smiles of people excited to get vaccinated, who had hopes of moving toward a new kind of normal."" She says it has been heartbreaking to hear about the pressure on staff and hospitals as Covid cases rise, adding it was a ""bit unnerving to see hospitals overwhelmed at the end of summer before flu season even starts"". Idara adds she is most concerned about online misinformation about coronavirus vaccines and Covid-19, as it could ""stifle efforts to curb the continued spread of Covid"". Hugh PymBBC News Health Editor The former Prime Minister Gordon Brown has called for urgent
action by Joe Biden, Boris Johnson and the G20 chair Mario Draghi to end what
he calls âthis vaccine inequality that shames the worldâ. Brown has previously criticised G7 leaders for failing, in
his view, to announce more radical policies for global vaccine distribution at
their summit in June. Now he says his own research reveals that this month and
next month 10 million vaccine doses made at a South African factory for Johnson
& Johnson will be exported to the European Union. The EU has agreed, he
says, that from October all African-produced vaccines should stay in
Africa. But he argues this should have been implemented immediately
and brands the situation as an example of attitudes in developing nations that are âshocking, unfair and bordering on the neo-colonialâ. Brown goes on to
say delays mean only 30% of adults in Africa will be guaranteed
vaccination by next summer, about half the current rate now in wealthy
economies. A government spokesperson says the UK is committed to
improving access to vaccines and 100 million surplus doses will be donated
within the next year, with the first delivered last week.  The daily figures on coronavirus in the UKhave been released by the government,,externalshowing that a further 28,438 cases have been picked up in the UK. In the past three weeks, daily cases have varied between 21,000 and 33,000. A further 26 deaths have also been announced today. While the number of deaths are often lower on a Monday because of reporting delays, today's figure is less than the 37  last Monday. The latest numbers on vaccination show that 77% of adults in the UK have now had both doses of a jab, while very nearly nine in 10 - 89.5% - have had their first dose. Japan's rebound came as spending by individuals and businesses bounced back from the initial impact of the coronavirus Official figures show Japan's economy grew faster than expected from its pandemic-driven slump in the run-up to the Tokyo Olympics. Japan - which is the world's third-largest economy - grew at twice the rate forecast in April to June. But analysts have said growth will be modest this quarter after a state of emergency was reimposed to ease a spike in Covid-19 infections Tokyo, Saitama and Chiba are all in a state of emergency, while one has been requested by another of Japan's prefectures, Shizuoka. Japan's recovery remains much slower than has been seen in other advanced economies such as the US. More on this story here. President Muhammadu Buhari was in the UK for two weeks Nigeria's President Mohammadu Buhari has gone into self-isolation on arrival from the UK. This comes after the country's high commission in London was closed last week for 10 days after some staff tested positive for coronavirus. The president's office said his isolation was in line with guidelines for international arrivals. There are reports that the president was in close contact with the high commission officials who tested positive for coronavirus. President Buhari was in the UK for a global education summit and medical check-up. Nigeria has been reporting a rise in Covid-19 infections. A 91-year-old care home resident was surprised with a re-enactment of her granddaughter's wedding day after she was unable to attend the nuptials due to Covid restrictions. Audrey Dear missed Holly's wedding to partner Steve Kennedy so staff at the Weald Heights care home in Sevenoaks, Kent, brought a version of the ceremony to her. They filled the care home with balloons and decorations and everyone enjoyed an afternoon tea. To add to the surprise, the new Mrs Kennedy's gown included a cutting from her grandmother's own wedding dress. Maria Covington, the care home's manager, said it had been ""incredibly hard keeping the plans a secret, but it was worth it to see her surprise when Holly and Steve arrived in their wedding attire"". ""Audrey had a wonderful afternoon surrounded by her close family. ""This was a very emotive and happy occasion that brought joy to a very special grandmother."" Travel agent says when he was ""pinged"" it was a ""bit of a disaster"" for his business We've been in the market town of Woodbridge in Suffolk, asking the small businesses there how they're feeling now the self-isolation rules have changed. From today, people no longer need to self-isolate if they come into contact with a positive case. Last month, there were mass staff shortages and firms struggled as hundreds of thousands of people were told to self-isolate. Travel agent Lee Hunt says the change in guidance is a ""step in the right direction"". ""The travel industry is really struggling anyway, so when I was pinged and we were running on just one person a day, we were having to close early, open late, do half days and there's a good chance we lost bookings and business because of that. ""We are only working on two staff members at the moment so [the change] gives me confidence that we are not going to need to unexpectedly take time off and we can roster, and it is good for those on the high street, too, and hopefully it will increase footfall.""

It says it is reviewing reports of suspected side effects of menstrual disorders and unexpected vaginal bleeding following a Covid vaccine. But it makes clear the evidence seen so far does not support a link between changes to menstrual periods and the vaccines - and the number of reports about menstrual disorders and vaginal bleeding is low in relation to the number of people vaccinated. And it adds: ""The menstrual changes reported are mostly transient in nature. ""There is no evidence to suggest that Covid-19 vaccines will affect fertility and the ability to have children."" But it says any woman who, since getting the vaccine, sees persistent changes to her periods that are unusual, or has any new vaginal bleeding after the menopause, should contact their doctor. ""The MHRA continues to closely review reports of suspected side effects of menstrual disorders and unexpected vaginal bleeding,"" it says. It also reassures pregnant women who are worried about getting the vaccine, saying there is no pattern to suggest any of vaccines increase the risk of miscarriage, stillbirth, congenital anomalies or birth complications. More from the MHRA's website here.,external People in England may need to prove they are fully vaccinated to go to nightclubs and some other venues in England from the end of September. The government has said that's the plan - although we are still waiting for the final details.

Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst People wearing protective face masks walk during evening rush hour in Beijing Ahead of the new school year, local governments
in China are deciding whether to allow students back into the classroom. In the cities of Beijing and Wuhan nurseries and primary schools can reopen from 1 September. However, in the eastern city of Zhengzhou, whichrecently experienced severe flooding, students will have to learn online. âSchools
will be reopenedâ¦ if no new cases are recorded for 14 consecutive days,â the
Global Times newspaper says. In southwestern Yunnan and eastern Shandong
province, teachers and students must undergo 14 days of
self-quarantine before they start back at school. Global Times says that many students will âbe
strictly checked with their 'health code' when they register and return to
schoolâ. This is a digital QR code that is linked to a smart
phone ownerâs medical history. In Taiwan, cases have all but vanished after a
huge outbreak that began in May. However, according to the Taiwan News website,
all nursery, school and university students will be required to wear masks in
northern Taipei â one of the islandâs Covid-19 hotspots - when they return on 1
September.  Nearly 120,000 people under 30 in Wales have still not taken up their first vaccine dose, according to data from Public Health Wales. Senior Welsh doctor David Bailey, a GP and head of the Welsh part of the British Medical Association, has said there needs to be a push to jab that age group. ""That will reduce not just transmission, but also of course, serious illness, which will mean the NHS can get on with the massive backlog we've got to deal with over the next three or four years,"" said the Caerphilly doctor. Bailey said he accepted the risks of becoming critically ill from Covid were fewer for young people, but that there were still overwhelming benefits of vaccination. ""Certainly, the evidence at the moment suggests that younger people are more likely to get long Covid, even though they are much less likely to die,"" he said. More here. Emlyn Begley, BBC Sport It was the weekend Premier League fans had been waiting more than 17 months for - and it did not disappoint. We saw full stadiums for the first time since the Covid pandemic shut football down in March 2020, the traditional 3pm fixtures were back and there were a near-record number of goals. ""It is amazing. It changes everything. Two or three months ago, something was missing,"" said Spurs boss Nuno Espirito Santo after their1-0 win over Manchester City. ""The games were good but the fans are what it is all about - the edge of the game, and the boys need it."" He is not wrong. Football behind closed doors - with fake crowd noise on the TV and radio - has just not been the same. Last season, there were a few weeks with 2,000 fans allowed at some games in the winter, before two weeks of larger crowds at the end of the campaign, plus trials at Wembley in the FA Cup and Carabao Cup. But full stadiums are back now. The roar from the 16,479 at the first-ever Premier League game to be played at Brentford - Friday's win over Arsenal - will live long in the memory. A crowd of 72,732 packed into Old Trafford to watch Manchester United hammer Leeds. Everton striker Dominic Calvert-Lewin, who scored against Southampton, said: ""It's a great feeling to score with fans being back in the stadium. I felt like a kid again."" And Trevoh Chalobah's goal on his Premier League debut - and hisemotional reaction- would not have been the same without his fellow Chelsea fans in the stands to celebrate with him. Read more from Emlyn here. We've heard about some of the unusual venues that have been transformed into vaccination centres - including mosques, stadiums and London's Science Museum. Now a former John Lewis store - which closed permanently in June - will become Aberdeen's main coronavirus vaccination centre. Most of the city's vaccinations so far have been taking place at the TECA/P&J Live events complex to the north-west of Aberdeen. But now, with restrictions easing, that complex can resume hosting concerts and conferences. The Ideal Home exhibition will be its first public event since the pandemic began, when it takes place next month. The full story is here. The changes to self-isolation rules have already been implemented in Scotland and Wales The rules on self-isolation are changing in England and Northern Ireland today, meaning if you're fully vaccinated you no longer have to quarantine if you come into contact with a person with Covid. Instead, you're advised to take a test. But the doctors' union the British Medical Association says we're still in a ""very precarious situation"", adding ""we strongly urge the public to remain cautious and take sensible precautions"". The BMA urges people to follow the guidance and take a PCR test if they come into close contact with a positive case. Dr Penelope Toff from the BMA says the government now needs to focus on ""greater efforts to increase vaccine uptake in the population, especially among younger adults and eligible adolescents, as well as revisiting policies to make infection control measures mandatory again in public settings"". The guidance for health and care workers who come into contact with a positive case is already stricter - while they don't have to isolate, they're advised to take daily lateral flow tests for 10 days.

It was decided during its meeting with the national and Tokyo governments, as well as the International Paralympic Committee. The move was widely expected as Japan continues to see a surge in Covid-19 cases. Shortly before the announcement, the government has also proposed to expand the country's state of emergency to include seven other prefectures, while extending it for Tokyo and others until 12 September. But the officials say school children will be allowed to attend the Paralympic Games if local authorities or school administrators request it. The Olympics were also largely held without spectators.

Spurs beat Manchester City without Kane,"This video can not be played Tottenham 1-0 Manchester City: Nuno Espirito Santo 'very proud' of Spurs after opening win Tottenham made light of the absence of unsettled Harry Kane to start the Premier League season with a win over champions Manchester City and their Â£100m man Jack Grealish. Kane - heavily linked with a move to Manchester City - sat out this pulsating encounter but Pep Guardiola wasted no time in throwing in his British record signing from Aston Villa. It was Son Heung-min who gave new manager Nuno Espirito Santo the perfect start to his reign with a low shot that snaked beyond Manchester City keeper Ederson 10 minutes after the break. Spurs fully deserved their win as they survived a shaky opening phase to play with real purpose, already showing signs of the Nuno trademark with fierce defensive discipline allied to pace on the break. Grealish had a quiet debut, being shown a yellow card late on, and it was actually Spurs who had the best opportunity after Son's goal, only for Steven Bergwijn to shoot wide when clean through. City had fleeting opportunities but rarely tested Spurs keeper Hugo Lloris as they looked rusty in contrast to the sharpness of their opponents. Reaction to Tottenham's victory over Man City Harry Kane has been at Tottenham since he was a schoolboy Manchester City's pursuit of England captain Kane gave this game an added edge - so how the home fans enjoyed victory against the club attempting to snatch away their main marksman. And Spurs delivered exactly what their supporters, finally back inside their magnificent new stadium, wanted with this opening-weekend victory - the chance to taunt Manchester City and to remind Kane what he might be leaving behind. Late on, those fans sent a chant of 'are you watching, Harry Kane?' reverberating around the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. And it was Son, the man who has been Kane's partner in goals for so many years, who provided the flourish befitting this high-octane Spurs performance with a typical piece of skill and ingenuity to slide the winner low past Ederson. Spurs players - and manager - Nuno rightly took the acclaim at the final whistle. The home side had heroes everywhere in match-winner Son, the outstanding defender Japhet Tanganga and the tireless Lucas Moura. It remains to be seen how the Kane affair plays out but this will be the perfect psychological lift to Spurs that will sustain them until the saga comes to a close one way or the other. This video can not be played Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola says new signing Jack Grealish was 'excellent' Manchester City's race appeared run long before the end of this game, with the early spark of promise snuffed out by the endeavour and skill of Spurs. Grealish made some useful contributions early on but his day ended in the frustration of a yellow card and it is clear Guardiola, understandably, still has some work to do to integrate his talents into a squad already packed with creative ability. One look at the City bench hinted at what Guardiola can introduce in the weeks ahead, even if Kane does not make the move to Manchester. Kevin de Bruyne, Oleksandr Zinchenko and Gabriel Jesus were introduced in the final 20 minutes, while England's Euro 2020 pair Kyle Walker and John Stones were unused substitutes, as were Aymeric Laporte, Rodri and Bernardo Silva - a formidable array of talent. But nothing could save this over-complicated and listless City show with Benjamin Mendy showing yet again what a flawed figure he is at left-back while Nathan Ake was also uncomfortable. And, significantly, City's lack of punch, with the great Sergio Aguero now gone, may just have prompted Guardiola to look even further into the acquisition of Kane, especially as Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester United have already given notice that there will be very little margin for error in the title race this season.
