Button set to replace Alonso at Monaco,"Button and Alonso have three world championship titles between them Britain's Jenson Button looks set to replace Fernando Alonso at McLaren for the Monaco Grand Prix in May. Alonso will miss Monacoto race in the Indianapolis 500,with full support from McLaren and engine partner Honda. McLaren executive director Zak Brown says two-time champion Alonso's replacement is ""not in place"". But there is no other serious option than Button, 37, who is contracted to McLaren as a reserve driver and will race barring unexpected circumstances. The 2009 world champion retired from Formula 1at the end of last seasonand has spent the winter in California training for Ironman triathlons, his long-time passion. He signed a contract with McLaren last autumn that committed him to replacing any race driver who was not able to take part in a grand prix this year. As part of that contract, the team also has an option on signing him to race in 2018. 5 live F1 podcast - Button is back Alonso to race at Indy 500 over Monaco Button disqualified from Ironman competition for speeding Go ahead for grands prix on British roads Button tweeted a jokey reaction on Wednesday after the news of Alonso's Indy programme was announced, asking: ""Why do I have so many missed calls?"" Meanwhile, Brown told a Bahrain news conference, held to discuss Alonso's Indy programme, that ""conversations were ongoing"" over the Spaniard's replacement. Alonso struggled to keep his McLaren in contention in China recently and eventually retired from the race ""We have a few different options, we will state who that is when we know,"" he said. ""Eric [Boullier], who runs the F1 team, is ultimately responsible for making the recommendation as to what driver should go in the car and I think he will be here at the weekend so I can save questions for him, he is working on it. ""I wouldn't want to share the conversations he has had with whom."" Button's compatriot and former team-mate, Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton, said: ""I hope Jenson comes back and it will be great for the sport if Jenson comes in. ""Jenson is still one of the best drivers in the world and his calibre and experience make him the best choice."" Hamilton and Button drove together at McLaren between 2010 and 2012. Button is the only serious alternative McLaren have. Alonso is one of the top three or four drivers in the world and they need an experienced replacement for a race where they have one of their best chances of the season to score decent points. The McLaren chassis is quite strong, but the car is being let down by its Honda engine, which is said to be at least 100bhp down on the best in F1. Monaco is one of the tracks on the calendar where engine power is least important in determining lap time. Alonso finished fifth there last year, when Honda also had a power deficit. On top of that, there are very few available drivers with the required level of skill and expertise. Mexican Esteban Gutierrez and Brazil's Felipe Nasr both raced last year and are potentially free, but are non-starters for a team such as McLaren needing to find a replacement for a two-time champion. And Button's deal was struck with exactly this sort of situation in mind.

What on earth is happening to Turkey?," Some guests were awoken by the gunshots, others by the buzzing of three Black Hawk helicopters. It was the early hours of 16 July 2016. Around two-dozen Turkish commandos dropped into the grounds of the luxury Club Turban hotel in the coastal resort of Marmaris, armed with automatic rifles and grenades. They were hunting one man - Recep Tayyip Erdogan. The president had been holidaying at a private villa linked to the hotel. Tanks move through the streets of Ankara While rebel soldiers in Istanbul and Ankara blocked roads and bombed state buildings, the commandos had been sent to capture the president. It should have been the climax of their coup d'etat. Opening fire and hurling grenades, they stormed the hotel, killing two bodyguards. But they were too late. Acting on a tip-off, Erdogan had been whisked away from the resort by helicopter. Once at Dalaman Airport, he took a private jet to Istanbul, with his pilot masking its identity so it  appeared on radars as a normal civilian passenger plane. After 03:00, the president emerged outside Istanbul's Ataturk Airport to the roars of his supporters. The coup attempt had failed - and Recep Tayyip Erdogan was to emerge stronger than ever. President Erdogan's message to the Turkish people For many, that night marked the rebirth of modern Turkey. En route to Istanbul, Erdogan made a video-call to Turkish television, urging people on to the streets to resist the coup attempt. Turks responded en masse - and 265 people were killed in the process. Some lay in front of rebel tanks to block their advance, others ran into gunfire on the Bosphorus bridge, trying to overpower the coup plotters. By dawn, the coup had failed. For the first time since the foundation of the Turkish republic in 1923, the people had managed to stand up to the tanks. Over the decades, four coups had succeeded - Erdogan ensured a fifth did not. Millions gathered in nightly rallies, chanting his name and singing his campaign song. Erdogan went from almost losing control of his country to becoming untouchable. But for Turkey's most powerful leader since its founding father, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, it wasn't enough. After 11 years as prime minister, Erdogan had been elected president in 2014. The post was traditionally largely ceremonial but Erdogan had other ideas. The dominant figure in Turkish politics had long dreamed of enshrining his authority through constitutional change, turning Turkey from a parliamentary to a presidential republic, scrapping the post of prime minister and consolidating his hold on the country. On 16 April the Turkish people will decide in a referendum whether to accept his grand reform. The decision has become, in effect, a referendum on Erdogan and the Turkey he has moulded in his image - fiercely nationalist, conservative and beset by problems. This previously stable corner of the region has become consumed by terror attacks - once-rapid economic growth has stalled. Dozens of journalists are in jail. Three million, mostly Syrian, refugees have poured into the country. Tens of thousands of people have been arrested or dismissed following the failed coup. The country's hope of EU membership is evaporating. And Turkey is arguably more politically polarised than ever. But at the same time, Turkey has gone from a financial basket-case at the turn of the century into one of the world's top 20 economies. The middle-class has hugely expanded. Millions of impoverished Turks have been economically emboldened under Erdogan's leadership. Schools, hospitals, roads and giant infrastructure projects have transformed daily life. Pious Turks, who long felt excluded by an old secular elite, have been empowered. And Turkey has freed itself from the grip of a once omnipotent military. And now, the country will vote on its future. The president’s portrait stares down on Recep Tayyip Erdogan University in his family’s hometown of Rize, on Turkey’s Black Sea coast. Little says “personality cult” like naming an institution after a leader while he’s still alive. Hatice Yildiz, 22, sits in the central courtyard. The wooden bench is embossed with Erdogan’s name, naturally. Erdogan's hometown of Rize is 700 miles(1,100 km) east of Istanbul “I’m proud of my president and I’m proud of my university’s name,"" says the English literature student. ""He is really a good leader - a world leader.” Founded in 2006, the university took the president’s name five years ago and now boasts 20,000 students. Its modern faculties are spread across Rize - a small, unremarkable city, the beautiful mountains surrounding it blighted by drab high-rise buildings. The Recep Tayyip Erdogan University in Rize The region is a heartland of Turkish nationalism - the conservative and religious side of Turkey that felt forgotten for decades and that found its saviour in Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Many here were ostracised by the old secular elite, who built up the Turkish Republic from its genesis in 1923 with the ideals of its founding father, Ataturk - westward-looking and fiercely secular, resisting the pull of the Islamic Middle East. The Muslims of Anatolia often felt like second-class citizens, labelled “black Turks” as opposed to the bourgeois “white Turks”. They were banned from wearing headscarves in public institutions - until Erdogan came along, a conservative Muslim himself, the first prime minister whose wife wore a headscarf. His government repealed the ban in 2013. Hatice Yildiz “My mother said it was really bad in her time,” says Yildiz, who herself wears a headscarf. “Men could go to university but girls couldn’t, because they were covered. A person should be able to go anywhere they want - it shouldn’t be about their religion or their appearance. “Before Recep Tayyip Erdogan, that’s what it was like. And he destroyed that law.” Much of Erdogan’s support is underpinned by his championing of the Muslim cause. In Rize, they love his piety - and of course, his local roots. While Erdogan himself was born in Istanbul, he had strong family ties to Rize - his grandparents migrated there from Georgia and his father was born in the port city. Standing by the giant mosque in Guneysu, the village adjoining Rize where Erdogan has a house, relative Sadullah Mutlu says he remembers the young Recep as “a mature boy, always ambitious and interested in politics”. He wanted initially to become a professional footballer but was drawn towards the youth branch of an Islamist political movement. Soon after, he married Emine Gulbaran, with whom he has four children. His political rise was quick, becoming mayor of Istanbul, when he was briefly imprisoned under the secular regime for reciting a religious poem. Erdogan’s working-class origins in the Black Sea and childhood in the poor Istanbul neighbourhood of Kasimpasa gave him his common touch and ability to connect with ordinary voters. His supporters here feel he is their voice. Erdogan's face on a building in Rize Mehmet Meral is among them. Since the 1950s, his family has owned 140 acres of tea plantations in the mountains around Rize. It is the centre of the country’s tea industry, with Turkey the world’s fifth largest producer. Terraced rows nestle beside fast-flowing streams and Ottoman-era stone bridges. “Recep Tayyip Erdogan is one of us,” Meral says, “he’s one of the people. Before, all the leaders were rich kids or high class. He’s not like that.” He speaks our language, gets aggressive like we do - and tells the world what we want to say” That raw emotion is on show in the president’s rally in Rize, drumming up support for the constitutional referendum. He holds the stage for an hour, enthralling thousands of supporters with talk of bringing back the death penalty for the coup-plotters and vaunting Turkey’s giant infrastructure projects. Economic development is the other big driving force behind his support. He also hits out at Europe, continuing a row after European leaders banned his ministers from campaigning among the Turkish diaspora in their countries. “A few fascists will never destroy Turkey’s honour,” he proclaims, calling on Turks to “defy the grandchildren of Nazis” and back the constitutional change. Such abrasive comments have infuriated Western governments but delight his fans, who wear headbands with his name and chant his campaign song. The only other face on the giant flags is Ataturk - and Erdogan is now on the verge of eclipsing the republic’s greatest icon. The old secular ideals of Ataturk are virtually a distant memory in this side of Turkey. As his speech ends, Erdogan and his ministers throw presents into the crowds - chess sets and children’s toys. Outstretched hands clamber for the offering, a look of desperation in the faces of those for whom grasping the gift is second only to touching the great man. And then Erdogan cuts a ribbon to symbolise the start of construction work on an airport in Rize - he has doubled the number of airports in Turkey in the past decade as his infrastructure drive ploughs on, helping win votes. The reverence he commands is virtually unparalleled in the democratically elected world - “if he told me to die for him, I would” is a refrain you sometimes hear among his supporters. It is a level of devotion matched only by the depth of hatred he inspires in the other side of this polarised country. Istanbul's Gezi Park is a rare green space in the middle of a city choked by concrete. Next to Taksim Square, Istanbul's iconic heart, it is a haven of trees and grass amid the blaring car horns. Gezi was never an award-winning park - but its importance was transformed overnight in 2013. As the government announced plans to redevelop it into a shopping mall, it became the symbol of another turning-point in Erdogan's leadership. A few dozen environmentalists camped out in the park to show their disapproval. At dawn on 28 May, police moved in, burning down the tents and using tear gas. It was the spark that lit the biggest street protests in Turkey's modern history. The image of the Woman in Red was widely shared on social media “It was empowering,” says Foti Benlisoy, a publisher and Gezi park protester. “We had the sense we were making history.” Millions took to the streets across Turkey, spurred by the police violence but actually demonstrating about much more. Erdogan, who had seemed like a pro-European reformer in his early years, was showing an increasingly authoritarian side. The park itself turned into a giant carnival-like movement, similar to the Occupy protests elsewhere. Environmentalists were joined by leftist groups, Kurds, football fan clubs and a range of others. For a few days at least, the park hosted thousands of varied peaceful protesters. But on Taksim Square, and across the country, clashes with police escalated fast. Mark Lowen reporting on the Gezi Park/Taksim Square clashes “It was a de facto coalition of grievances,” says Benlisoy. “There was growing discomfort over the aggressive urban policies of the governing AK Party - over-building, commercialising common spaces, handing out tenders to Erdogan-friendly businessmen - with opposition from women's and LGBT movements, students and social rights groups.” Conservatism was taking over - restrictions on alcohol sales and abortions were announced, and Erdogan had urged women to have more children. Work had begun for Turkey's biggest mosque despite complaints that it was being built on protected forest land and would dominate Istanbul's skyline. While some members of the government tried a more conciliatory approach to the protesters, Erdogan clamped down hard, labelling them “marauders” and accusing them of “drinking alcohol in a mosque” - something the mosque's imam then denied. Early AKP rule under Erdogan reached out to democrats and liberals, leftists and Kurds, says Benlisoy. “But after Gezi his rhetoric became about the 'domination' of one side of Turkey towards the other, defining his support base by confrontation with the other.” The polarisation deepened as Erdogan was shaken by leaks of phone conversations later in 2013 that appeared to implicate him and his inner circle in corruption allegations, which he fiercely denied. He stoked the old Ottoman-era mentality of a Turkey under siege from its enemies, illustrated by the old adage “the only friend of a Turk is a Turk”. There was a new conspiracy theory every week as the prime minister increasingly turned to arch-loyalists, while expelling or sidelining members of his own party who dared to dissent. Freedom of expression was heavily squeezed. The progress of Erdogan's early years receded, as critical journalists, writers or artists were tarnished as “traitors”. Turkey regained its record as the world's leading jailer of journalists. Erol Onderoglu is among the 150 journalists now in prison or facing trial. A long-term representative of the watchdog Reporters Without Borders, Onderoglu attended an editorial meeting for a Kurdish paper, Ozgur Gundem, to mark World Press Freedom Day. The government accused the newspaper of spreading Kurdish “terrorism propaganda” and closed it. The prosecutor is now asking for a 14-year sentence against Onderoglu. For over a decade, we hoped that Turkey could belong to a European family... But then I found myself being handcuffed like an assassin.” He spent 10 days in prison and faces trial in June. As he recounts the toughest moment, his voice breaks. “When my wife and son came to visit me, I had to talk to them through the glass. That's when I realised what an injustice had been done to me.” Dozens of media outlets have been closed since the failed coup, and journalists have been variously charged with “terrorism propaganda” or “insulting the president”. Protest outside Cumhuriyet's office after editors were arrestedOctober 2016 Turkey's oldest mainstream newspaper, the secularist Cumhuriyet, has been raided and its editors arrested. Other critical voices have left the country or been jailed. Erdogan claims Turkey has “the world's freest press”, while also stating those in prison are not journalists but “terrorists, thieves or child molesters”. “Erdogan directly or indirectly controls 80% of the media in Turkey,” says Onderoglu, of the situation facing journalists. “Any criticism of him is seen as criticism of the state. The definition of the job we do has been systematically eliminated from the Turkish dictionary.” For Erdogan, extreme times justify extreme measures. “There is no difference between a terrorist holding a gun or a bomb and those who use their pen and position to serve their aims,” he said, after Turkey’s worst ever terror attack, which killed 103 people outside Ankara train station in October 2015. It heralded his crackdown - and dozens more attacks to come. Aynur Yaman, an ethnic Kurd, knows the cost more than most. In her one-room house in a desperately poor village close to Diyarbakir, the biggest city in southeast Turkey, she now cares for her seven children alone. Aynur Yaman Her husband, Mehmet Salih Yaman, was killed last year when a truck blew up close to their home. It was believed to be carrying explosives belonging to the outlawed Kurdish militant group the PKK, possibly stockpiled for a future attack. “They found his left finger and matched his DNA,” she says, “that’s all I remember - I had lost my mind.” She glances up at his photo that she keeps on the wall. In the corner, her one year-old baby starts to cry. He had just been born when his father died. “The PKK took away our dreams and stole a father of seven in the prime of his life,” 33-year-old Yaman says. “I don’t want to see their faces anymore. I will now vote for the people who have been supporting us psychologically and financially - for Erdogan.” Close to 30 terror attacks in the past two years have killed about 500 people. Kurdish militants were behind some - mainly targeting police officers and soldiers - while so-called Islamic State struck public areas, including Istanbul’s Ataturk airport and the city’s Reina nightclub last New Year’s Eve. Turkey feels constantly on edge, awaiting the next attack - security is the biggest issue for many as they prepare to vote. A ceasefire with the PKK broke down in July 2015, restarting a conflict that has killed 40,000 people since the 1980s. Some blamed the militants for resuming armed attacks, others believe Erdogan engineered an end to the truce to whip up nationalist votes and regain the parliamentary majority he lost a month earlier. If so, it worked - the AKP won back its majority in November 2015 and he’s hoping his hardline stance on terror will achieve victory in this referendum too. Kurds clash with police in protest at curfews in DiyarbakirDecember 2015 Large swathes of the southeast have seen curfews, military operations and urban warfare over the past two years. The UN estimates 2,000 people have been killed - soldiers and civilians - while the Turkish army says it has eliminated thousands of militants. The neighbourhood of central Diyarbakir where the worst of the fighting raged has been completely destroyed, with houses razed to the ground and surrounding buildings still torn by bullet holes. Thirteen MPs from the pro-Kurdish HDP, which became the third-biggest party in parliament in 2015, have been imprisoned for alleged links to the PKK and 86 mayors have been replaced by the government. Kurds who finally found a national political voice two years ago now feel silenced. “The vast majority here think Erdogan and his people are responsible for the devastation that’s happened,” says Ziya Pir, an HDP MP who faces 23 years in prison for “terrorism propaganda” and “membership of a terrorist organisation”. Bullet holes on a building in Diyarbakir Kurdish voters are split between conservative Erdogan supporters and the HDP - but he is adamant over where the blame lies. “The old nationalist mentality of Turkey couldn’t allow Kurds to be partners in ruling the country - they had to kill it.” He worries that hundreds of thousands in the southeast will be disenfranchised in the referendum after being displaced by the conflict and losing their voter registration. Now the only way to return to peace, he says, is with a “no” vote. “With a ‘yes’, Erdogan would establish an authoritarian regime that may lead Turkey into a dictatorship. If it’s a ‘no’, Erdogan will see he can’t be genuinely successful without the help or votes of the Kurds. A ‘no’ would give a chance to return to negotiations to solve the Kurdish problem”. AK Party office in Diyarbakir Erdogan argues strong central leadership will give him the power to face down Turkey’s terror threats. But critics argue his government’s lax control of the border with Syria and support for Islamist factions has exposed Turkey to the IS threat and allowed jihadist cells to grow here. Moreover, Ankara’s policy in Syria, attacking the Kurdish militia there, has made Turkey ever more vulnerable, provoking retaliatory strikes by the PKK. Orhan Tokar was caught up in the terror attack on Kurdish supporters in Diyarbakir in June 2015, which was blamed on IS. He lost part of his left leg in the bombing. An HDP supporter, his ire is directed mainly at the Turkish government. “Erdogan can denounce me as a ‘terrorist’ or a ‘traitor to my country’ – my vote will always be ‘no’,” he says. “If ‘no’ wins, spring will arrive and people will be happy again. If it’s ‘yes’, the system will go back to Ottoman times, like a sultanate. And that will divide Turkey.” After a year of terror attacks, Turks felt they had reached the bottom. But then came the coup. “The Gulen movement is a perfect definition of a cult,” says Said Alpsoy, sitting in his study surrounded by books on Islam.A conservative researcher, he spent 17 years as a follower of Fethullah Gulen, the Islamic cleric who the government blames for orchestrating last year's failed coup. “When Gulen was eating an orange, he threw the peel on the ground. I watched as one of his doctors grabbed the peel and ate it. I realised from the body-language that this was routine. The soles of his old shoes would even be boiled and eaten by his followers.” Pro-Erdogan protesters hang an effigy of GulenJuly 2016 He seems embarrassed, apologising for the cruder examples he's about to give. “Once, after Gulen gave an emotional sermon, he cried a lot and the handkerchief with which he cleaned his nose was wet. A young student took that handkerchief and cleaned his own face with it, right in front of me. Also, the stones of the olives that Gulen ate were never thrown away. They were distributed as valuable gifts to lower-grade people in the movement.” Pupils at a Gulenist school in Turkey, 2008 Fethullah Gulen has built a network of followers since the 1960s, principally through schools and universities that he endowed in Turkey and across the world. The group presents itself as a “faith-inspired, non-political, cultural and educational movement” adhering to “sympathy, compassion and altruism” through projects ranging from private schools to poverty aid programmes. But followers ended up taking senior positions across Turkey’s public and private sectors, led by Gulen from self-imposed exile in the US. “The movement never said in so many words 'let's take over the state',” says Said Alpsoy. “Instead they would say: 'The state is taken over by the enemies of religion - let's get rid of these invaders and we will give it back to its real owners - the pious Muslims of Anatolia.'” For years, Gulen was an ally of Erdogan, helping him cleanse the military of secularists. But when the corruption scandal against the prime minister broke in 2013, Erdogan accused so-called Gulenists of tapping his phones and doctoring the evidence. Gulen became enemy number one, accused of leading a “parallel state”. The government saw the putsch in 2016 as a vindication of its suspicions, blaming Gulen and his network and demanding his extradition from the US. Foreign governments have cast doubt - the intelligence agencies of the EU and Germany have said they remain unconvinced that Gulen ordered the coup. The UK's Foreign Affairs Committee found that while some Gulen followers may have been involved, there is no conclusive evidence to suggest the movement as a whole was behind it. Turkey has so far failed to persuade Washington to extradite the cleric back to Turkey. Fethullah Gulen in his study in the US The shadow of the failed coup hangs over the current referendum battle, with Erdogan denouncing “no"" voters as “siding with the coup-plotters"" and a post-coup state of emergency limiting anti-Erdogan protests and making some reluctant to speak out. It has also convulsed Turkish society through an ongoing purge of those suspected of siding with or backing the coup. More than 160,000 people have been detained, dismissed or suspended - from police officers to pilots and teachers to businessmen. Erdogan and his allies have painted a picture of enemies plotting against Turkey, but the purge has also now created a pool of victims willing to vote against him. The president stands accused of purging opponents who had nothing to do with the coup. Hundreds of academics have been fired, including those who signed a petition last year calling on the government to cease its military operations in Kurdish areas of the country. Erdogan lambasted them as “so-called intellectuals”, a “fifth column” of foreign powers and terrorists. Oget Oktem Tanor is among them. Eighty-two years old, she was Turkey's first neuropsychologist and an emeritus professor of Istanbul University. Now she has lost various rights she held as a civil servant and has been banned from travelling abroad, charged with “terrorism propaganda”. Oget Oktem Tanor “It's absurd,” the softly-spoken academic says. “Of course I'm not helping terrorists. I just put my opinion into words by signing this petition. I have nothing to do with propaganda. Teaching and being with my students is my life, so it's very hard for me not to be with them again. For the first time, I felt depressed.” She looks out to the Bosphorus from an apartment she's occupied for decades, as she built her reputation as one of Turkey's leading academics. After the coup of 1971, she was forced to flee the country with her husband, facing imprisonment and possible torture for being leftists. “That time was still better than now,” she says, “because there was a judiciary you could trust and civil courts you could rely on. Now they are all under pressure and there's no separation of powers as there should be in a democracy. I really fear for the future of my country.” Fear is felt on Istiklal Caddesi - or Independence Avenue - Istanbul’s main shopping street, which was until recently a symbol of the city’s vibrancy. Hundreds of thousands of people thronged its cafes and shops each day, tourists riding the iconic rickety red tram past the foreign consulates and booksellers. Today, it’s dotted with empty shops and bars, ""for rent"" signs filling spaces that would have been snapped up in days just a couple of years ago. Some avoid walking up the street entirely since a bomb exploded on it last year, killing four foreign tourists. It’s a pattern repeated elsewhere. Leading foreign retailers, including C&A and Topshop, have pulled back from Turkey and the shopping malls that mushroomed in the past decade are no longer bustling. Tourism, which makes up around 10% of the Turkish economy, is declining rapidly. In 2014 Turkey was the world's sixth most-visited country - with 42 million tourists. That dropped to 25 million in 2016 as Western tourists stayed away because of security fears. Hotels have slashed rates in an effort to bring them back. Foreigners arriving in Turkey per monthJanuary 2015 - February 2017 At Istanbul's Grand Bazaar, traditionally one of the world's most-visited tourist attractions, Erol Avci sits outside the carpet shop where he has worked for 39 years, desperate for custom. “I started working here aged 18,” he says, “and this is the worst it's ever been. We're down by 80% and are not making any profit, so I'm not drawing a salary.” His boss owns two of the shops they occupy - the third is rented and they're considering leaving it. Several others have already done so - empty shop-fronts now line some of the narrow lanes in this centuries-old maze of traders. There's a creeping sense of financial crisis - a feeling that Turkey's good run has ended. After a crash in 2001 that saw chronic inflation and the Turkish lira reaching an exchange rate of 1.5 million against the US dollar, Erdogan built a reputation for economic competence. Growth soared to over 10% in 2011 and Turkey became known as the New Tiger, the fastest-growing economy in the G20 group of nations. But terror attacks and political turbulence have led to the economy shrinking for the first time since 2009. Unemployment is over 12%. The Turkish lira has lost a quarter of its value against the dollar since mid-2016. “We are going through an economic crisis,” says Tekin Acar, whose chain of cosmetic stores is suffering. “Nobody is calling it that but sales are dropping, profits are falling and we will have to open smaller stores with fewer staff.” This malaise could play out in the referendum. Ali Avci sips tea outside his ceramics shop in the Grand Bazaar, trying to pass the day. He and his family have always voted for Erdogan's AK Party - but now for the first time, they plan to defy him and say “no” in the referendum. “This is a protest vote about the economy but also about Erdogan's lies, which we now see through social media,” he says. “Days go by without any customers now. I could survive here if this goes on for another year but then I'd have to close. People are afraid of saying they're going to vote no - but lots will.” It is a trend that appears to be gathering pace - some traditional AKP voters deserting the “yes” camp to voice their anger at the past two years of turbulence. Opposition campaigners in Istanbul Before the last general election, pro-government headlines screamed “AKP or chaos”. But even though the party won, chaos still came. And if Erdogan's once solid voter base begins to splinter, it could spell trouble for him in the referendum. In the last week of the campaign, the governors of Istanbul and Ankara banned two large “no” rallies, claiming they couldn’t guarantee security. “Yes” rallies, however, went ahead – and free buses were provided to transport those who wanted to come. On my 20-minute walk from my home to the BBC office in Istanbul, I counted 18 “yes” posters and one for “no”. In some places “no” campaigners have been attacked and some people have been sacked for publicising their opposition. Government supporters remain convinced that anti-Erdogan bias in the West is misconceived and point out that Turkey is - among other things - the world’s largest host of refugees. It became the main route for those crossing to Europe, with thousands boarding dinghies every night from the Turkish coast to the Greek islands, and many drowning en route. Turkey struck a deal with the EU to stem the flow - sending failed asylum seekers back. It’s widely believed that European leaders have tempered their criticism of Erdogan because they needed his co-operation on migrants. But in some Western capitals, anger at Turkey’s unpredictable leader is growing. The European Parliament called for a suspension of EU membership negotiations. In Turkey, this referendum will be a turning point. A “yes” would greatly strengthen Erdogan’s hand, giving him unprecedented power and possibly allowing him to remain in office until 2029, as well as virtually guaranteeing him and his family immunity from any attempts at prosecution. A “no” would not spell the end for him - but would embolden the Turkish opposition and provide a chance for a political challenge. Whichever way it goes, the chasm between Turkey and the West has grown dramatically. Some blame Erdogan for that but others see the fault with the EU - that it had a window of opportunity after opening negotiations in 2005 to coax Erdogan into long-lasting reforms. Instead, the argument goes, the EU gave way to the rhetoric of the likes of France’s Nicolas Sarkozy, who called Turkish membership “unthinkable”. Turkey sensed it would continue to be held in the EU’s waiting room. “Sadly, Europe sees President Erdogan and Turkey as an ‘other’ through which to deflect their internal problems onto a distant and imaginary enemy,” wrote Ibrahim Kalin, the president’s spokesman. “It only deepens the sense of mistrust that is already poisoning relations between Turkey and Europe on the one hand and Islamic and Western societies on the other.” Turkey matters. It remains a vital Western ally in the region, Nato’s eastern flank and a big trading partner. It is a crucial player in attempts to bring peace to Syria and the war against so-called Islamic State. As it tries, with faltering success, to pivot more towards Russia and Gulf States, that could have a considerable geopolitical impact. The West cannot afford to lose this country. “Democracy is like a train, Erdogan once famously said. “You get off once you have reached your destination.” Some believe he has many stations left to pass, others that this country is in the midst of a slow-motion train crash. This could be the crowning moment or the undoing of Erdogan’s Turkey. Built with Shorthand"
What are 'ordinary working families'?,"Reality Check says:The government defines ""ordinary working families"" as those that are not eligible for pupil premium but have below average incomes. It believes that accounts for about one third of all pupils in England, but this calculation is a work in progress. Education Secretary Justine Greening on Thursday kicked off a consultation on plans for grammar schools in England, saying that they must do more to help ""ordinary working families"" as the government pushes ahead with plans to allow more selective schools to open. There is no official definition of an ""ordinary working family"" but Ms Greening said on the Today Programme: ""They don't perhaps qualify for free school meals - for pupil premium - but actually they are growing up in families that are below median incomes."" The household earning the median income is the one for which half of families have a higher income and half have lower. The Pupil Premium is a pot of money set aside for children who are in care, eligible for free school meals or have had free school meals at any point in the last six years. Pupils are eligible for free school meals if their family is on one of a range of benefits or has a household income of less than Â£16,190. So, if earning above Â£16,190 puts you at the bottom end of the ""ordinary working families"" definition, how is the government defining the top end of the range? Thepaper published on Wednesday,externalincluded the first attempt by government statisticians to come up with figures that set out how many children from different income brackets go to grammar schools. In the past, the only figures to help with this have been those covering how many children eligible for pupil premium go to particular schools, so expanding these statistics is an ambitious project. What the statisticians have done is to attempt to match individual pupils in schools with their families' income through looking at tax payments and tax credits details. These figures have then been adjusted to take into account things like household size, because if there are two families with identical household incomes, one of which has one child and the other has four children, their standards of living will not be the same. Taking all these adjustments into account, the median household income comes out as Â£20,000. However, some families earning more than Â£20,000 in total will still fall within the definition of an ordinary working family. For example, a single parent's income would be adjusted upwards, so it could be compared directly with the standard of living for a couple. For a two-parent family with two children, the government considers median income to be Â£33,000. The government says 35% of all pupils in England, which is 2.5 million children fall into its definition of coming from ordinary working families, because they fall below the median income but are not eligible for pupil premium. The government is consulting on how to improve the methodology because, for example, the income figures do not currently include households' earnings from self-employment. They also plan to adjust for housing costs in different parts of England. The consultation closes on 30 June. This new analysis has beenwelcomed as providing more detail,external, although there have been warnings from some education groups that the new work on ordinary working families will reduce the focus on the disadvantaged families who are eligible for pupil premium.

'Lucky' NHS struggles through winter,"As warmer weather and the Easter holidays arrive, the NHS in England is reflecting on what looks like the busiest, some would say the worst, winter on record. Official figures reveal the stresses and strains being felt during February after torrid times over the previous two months. February's A&E waiting time performance was slightly better than December's and January's, with 87.6% of patients treated or assessed within four hours. But it was still one of the worst monthly figures since records began more than a decade earlier, and it came after a fall in the number of people coming in to A&E units. Once patients got through A&E there could still be long waits. Adding up the number of patients between December and February, who waited more than four hours for a bed after a decision to admit, there was a total of 196,000, which was a 45% increase on the same period the previous year. Delayed transfers of patients who were medically fit to leave continued to cause problems for hospitals. There was a 17% increase in the number of beds not available to other patients in the year to February. NHS England said that in effect around 1,100 beds had been taken out of normal usage compared with February 2016. More than 36% of delays were linked to problems with social care services, the highest since the data was first collected in 2010. With some hospitals reporting that at times over the winter every bed was occupied, it is clear that the service was running flat out and very close to capacity. This in turn affected routine surgery, with bed shortages causing delays to procedures where an overnight stay was required. Hardly surprisingly there was a big jump, of nearly 40%, in the number of patients waiting more than 18 weeks for routine treatment. This might sound like ""same old, same old"" and the story of the NHS being under pressure is hardly new. Whatever the dire warnings, hospitals muddled through. But it is worth noting that the system came under such strain despite intense contingency planning, and demands by NHS chiefs that non-urgent procedures be cancelled for several weeks to clear the decks for emergency admissions. What must be worrying for NHS leaders is that hospitals were full at times, and waiting times were rising, even in a mild winter and with no above-average flu or norovirus cases. A sense of relief must be tempered by concern that the health service may not be so lucky next year. The system runs on very fine margins and it would not take much to seriously rock it. Hospitals and local health commissioners are working hard in most areas to manage patient flows into A&E departments and to treat more people in their local communities. There is a hope that extra investment in social care in England will facilitate the quicker discharge of patients. But two things are clear as summer approaches. Firstly, the traditional easing of pressure after winter does not happen any more as patient demand rises relentlessly month by month. Secondly, it won't be long before hospital managements have to start planning for next winter, aware that they won't be lucky every time.

One dizzying day of Trump U-turns,"This video can not be played Trump changes mind over Nato US President Donald Trump has reversed course in the space of 24 hours on an array of populist positions he adopted during the election campaign. He declared Nato was ""no longer obsolete"" and dropped his pledge to declare China a currency manipulator. Mr Trump also said he was no longer opposed to a federal exports agency he once dismissed as ""unnecessary"". And the president signalled he was open to reappointing Janet Yellen as head of the Federal Reserve. A list of Trump's broken promises Trump threatens to cut Obamacare payments How much has Trump achieved so far? Meanwhile, his administration dropped a freeze on federal hiring that it imposed in January. The about-faces suggest the mercurial Mr Trump may be favouring a more pragmatic, moderate approach to the hardline economic nationalism that helped elect him. The startling series of flip-flops come amid reports of a titanic White House power struggle between chief strategist Steve Bannon and senior adviser Jared Kushner. According to the Washington rumour mill, Mr Bannon - the former Breitbart News executive - has been sidelined after falling out with the president's son-in-law, Mr Kushner. Mr Trump's decision not to label China a ""currency manipulator"" emerged in an interview with the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday. That U-turn follows his talks last week with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Mr Trump repeatedly pledged to label Beijing a ""currency manipulator"" on his first day in office, during an election campaign when he also accused the Asian powerhouse of ""raping"" the US. But experts said a formal declaration to that effect by the Treasury Department could have led to US sanctions, which would have prompted retaliation from Beijing. Mr Trump's last campaign ad depicted Janet Yellen, head of the Federal Reserve, as a member of a shadowy globalist cabal ""who control the levers of power in Washington"". On Wednesday, he told the Wall Street Journal he ""respects"" the US central bank chief. He also indicated he might consider reappointing her next year, saying she would not be ""toast"". Mr Trump was once highly critical of the Fed, saying its low interest rate policy had hurt savers. Now he says he likes ""a low-interest rate policy"". On his first working day in office, Mr Trump signed a presidential memorandum to suspend hiring of non-military federal workers, in a move that delighted small government conservatives. The order mandated that ""no vacant positionsâ¦ may be filled and no new positions may be created"". But that policy was gone on Wednesday. White House budget director Mick Mulvaney said: ""It does not mean that the agencies will be free to hire willy-nilly."" He said they were ""replacing it with a smarter plan, a more strategic plan, a more surgical plan"". In the Wall Street Journal interview, the president praised the Export-Import Bank, which he dismissed in August last year as an ""unnecessary"" agency with ""a lot of excess baggage"". The bank, which provides taxpayer-backed loans for the purchase of US exports, is accused by conservatives of corporate cronyism and welfare. Now he plans to fill two vacancies on its board. ""It turns out that, first of all,"" Mr Trump told the Journal, ""lots of small companies are really helped."" Mr Trump repeatedly questioned the military alliance's purpose during the campaign. But as he hosted Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg at the White House on Wednesday, the US president said the threat of terrorism had underlined the alliance's importance. ""I said it [Nato] was obsolete,"" Mr Trump said. ""It's no longer obsolete."" This video can not be played ""European allies will have to step up to the plate"" and pay their fair share says former Nato Secretary General CNN political pundit David Gregory says the shifts show Trump is willing to be a dealmaking president. ""He's flexible, perhaps unprincipled, with a pragmatic approach to government,"" he said. But he warned that, although tacking back and forth is fine, it is dangerous to be ""all over the map"" because people stop believing what you say.

Parents' anger at baby deaths NHS trust,"Sophiya Hotchkiss was born prematurely An NHS trust at the centre of an investigation into its maternity services has been accused of failing to properly investigate the deaths of at least two babies. Jack Burn and Sophiya Hotchkiss died within six months of each other. Both families say their concerns were dismissed by the Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital Trust. The trust said it investigates all deaths, and takes appropriate action where necessary. But a third family was told that their daughter's death had been unavoidable, even though an inquest later found it could have been prevented. Baby death cluster: Jeremy Hunt orders investigation The families' stories At least seven avoidable deaths occurred at the trust between September 2014 and May 2016, with some families raising concerns about other deaths. BBC News revealed on Wednesday that Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has ordered a review of deaths and other maternity errors at the trust. Stephanie Prowse, and her partner, rushed to the Royal Shrewsbury Hospital in September 2014 because she was feeling unwell. She was 31 weeks pregnant with her third child. But the family said they were left in a side room for 40 minutes before staff checked her. A heart rate monitor showed that the baby, Sophiya, had a weak heart beat, and though she was delivered by emergency caesarean she died after 32 hours. ""If they had checked her heartbeat when I first arrived, I believe she would have had a heartbeat when she was born and so she wouldn't have been born sleeping,"" Stephanie told BBC News. ""If they had got her out, I truly believe it would have been a whole different story. I'd have a three-year-old running around."" The family asked the trust to look into the circumstances surrounding Sophiya's death but say they have never received a response. For its part, the trust told the BBC that an internal examination of the incident had indeed taken place though the family had not been involved. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists recommends that families are always invited to participate in such investigations. Those concerns have been echoed by the family of Jack Burn. He was born in March 2015 but died within hours, of hypoxia and Group B Strep. This video can not be played Hayley Matthews, mother of Jack Burn: ""He would have been OK"" His mother, Hayley Matthews, says that throughout her 36-hour-long labour at the Princess Royal Hospital in Telford, she was refused a caesarean section several times. Instead, she says, she was forced to have a natural birth during which her son's shoulder was trapped. By the time Jack was born, he was blue and limp and died shortly afterwards. ""They just expected me to push,"" said Hayley. ""I asked for a caesarean, they said 'no you'll be fine, you can do it'."" Ms Matthews says the death was never properly examined. In response, the trust told the BBC that it did investigate the death but admitted it had not included the family in its inquiry. After we highlighted her case, the local coroner is now considering opening an inquest into Jack Burn's death. The family of Pippa Griffiths were initially dismissed by the trust too. Their daughter died last April, around 30 hours after being born at home after contracting the Group B Strep infection. Her parents, Colin and Kayleigh, had called the trust in the middle of the night to say their daughter was vomiting brown mucus. Pippa Griffiths died in 2016 No action was taken, no advice was given, and hours later Pippa died. The trust visited the family to say that nothing could have prevented their daughter's death. Her parents refused to believe this and forced the trust to fully and properly investigate the death. Last week, the coroner ruled that Pippa's death was in fact avoidable, and that the trust had failed to provide the family with the information that could have saved her life. ""Why would they not raise that (the death) as a serious incident?"" asks Kayleigh. ""They knew what had happened, and they weren't going to do an investigation. ""That's when I said that's not good enough there will be an investigation and we will be involved,"" Kayleigh adds. Commenting on Pippa's death, the trust said: ""We are truly sorry that we were unable to provide the appropriate care that would have prevented Pippa's death."" ""We have apologised to Pippa's parents. ""We have carried out specific actions to address the issues this tragic case has highlighted to ensure we learn from these devastating events,"" it added.

Is Easter the new Christmas?,"There was a time when Easter meant a Sunday roast, strange homemade bonnets, a visit to Church and lots of chocolate. But with shops now offering trees, wreaths and crackers, is it becoming spring's answer to Christmas? Fresh flowers. White napkins. Fruit tarts. The dinner table for Good Housekeeping's Easter photo shoot was light, bright, and traditional. But look closely, and there's something unusual on the plates: sky blue Easter crackers. Carolyn Bailey is homes and garden editor for the magazine. She said more people were buying decorations for Easter than ever before. ""Easter is becoming like a second Christmas,"" she said. Retailers have hopped on the trend. A number of supermarkets - including Sainsbury's, Tesco and Waitrose - are stocking Easter crackers this year. Poundland have also got in on the action, offering everything from bunny banners to carrot-shaped fairy lights. Meanwhile Tesco, M&S and John Lewis are selling egg-speckled wreaths. Can British Easter eggs conquer the world? Easter getaway: When is busiest by road, rail and air Eggs are no longer just made of chocolate, but are painted and covered in beads, sparkles or pom-poms. And where do you hang these egg-cellent trinkets? On an Easter tree of course. Varying arrays of twigs - often painted white - are laden with colourful eggs and bunnies. There are more than 16,000 posts for#Eastertree,externalon Instagram and thousands more on Pinterest. And if your garden doesn't have much in the way of Instagram-able branches, a number of High Street stores are selling the skeletal trees ready for decorating. Decorated eggs are not a new phenomenon. House of FabergÃ© set the standard back in 1842. Eggs themselves have been associated with the Christian tradition for even longer. They symbolise both new life and the empty tomb. Canon Sarah Rowland Jones is from the Church in Wales. ""In many ways Easter is the more important Christian festival,"" she says. ""People should be given cause to remember what it's all about. ""If making more of Easter makes people look beyond the caricature of Christianity - at what is at the heart of what more than two billion people around the world practise - then it's a good thing."" An Easter wreath Easter continues to be the second-biggest retail event in the UK after Christmas. Market researcher, Mintel, estimated Easter to be worth Â£550 million to UK retailers in 2016. Craft giant, Hobbycraft has seen sales of its Easter range soar almost 44% compared to last year. Included in the range is a faux grass bunny which has completely sold out. Meanwhile, fillable egg characters are up 93% compared to 2016. These green bunnies - for the home or outside - are sold out Anna Protherough, a seasonal buyer for the retailer, said: ""More and more, people are looking for reasons to celebrate and because of this, seasonal events such as Halloween and Easter are becoming bigger and bigger."" Hobbycraft says ""decorating the home for Easter is bigger than ever before"" and that homeowners are inspired by crafters like American businesswoman Martha Stewart. Ms Stewart's online project tutorials currently include ""cosmic painted eggs"" and ""How to fold a napkin into a bunny"".

Should Scotland join Canada? Your responses,"Edinburgh and Ottawa The great Scottish poet Robert Burns once wrote that ""the best laid schemes o' mice an' men gang aft agley."" Or, as they say in Canada, ""The best laid schemes of mice and men go often askew"". Perhaps that explains how, in the midst of Brexit negotiations and as Scotland weighs a second referendum on independence, an obscure Canadian writer was able to capture people's imagination with his unconventional proposal: Scotland could quit the UK and join Canada instead. On the surface, it sounds improbable. But as Ken McGoogan told the BBC, ""in an ideal world, this might work really well"". His proposal has since been picked up by media outlets as far as China, and he says he's ""amazed and gobsmacked"" at the level of interest in an idea he initially described as a ""flight of fancy"". Scotland could leave UK and join Canada, says author Some 1,500 readers wrote to the BBC from across the UK and North America to weigh in on whether Scotland should become Canada's 11th province. Some found it was the best idea since chips-and-gravy. Others thought it would be a total disaster, like when they added the letter ""e"" to whisky. Here's what both Scots and Canadians had to say about the possibility of joining forces. ""We don't want to be part of another country, we *are* a country... My dream is that we gain our independence and keep our sovereignty, no handing it over to the EU."" - Scot Chegg, Ayr, Scotland Scottish independence referendum: what happens now? ""I think leaving the UK is a bad idea to start with, but leaving the UK to join Canada is absurd."" - Kyle Richardson, Scotland No campaign supporters cheer after Scotland voted to stay in the UK - Scotland's leader has proposed a second referendum ""Canada should really be joining with Scotland, as we are the original Canadians and they're basically just a big Scotland anyway."" - Rory Watt, Scotland ""Sorry, he's got this in reverse... Canada was part of Scotland 25 million years ago and its about time we re-united. Being Scottish lets us use all those uniquely Scottish phrases, wear kilts on a regular basis, and enjoy a quality of life not otherwise possible.  We could even switch to driving on the correct side of the road!"" - Martyn Ridley, Canada ""I don't know how we'll be able to squeeze in 40-50 new MPs into our already crowded House of Commons. I do welcome the access to the home of my ancestors, and maybe more choices of whiskys."" - Alex Milton, Winnipeg, Manitoba ""While I can't speak for all Canadians, myself and many, many others would happily welcome Scotland to join Canada as a full province. At the very least, we'd have Olympic curling all sewn up."" - Kevan Dettelbach, Vancouver, British Columbia ""Joining Canada would be fantastic...They already have Nova Scotia, now they'd also have the original Scotia!"" - Colin Groundwater, West Lothian, Scotland ""At last someone has published what I have long thought. I think it makes good sense culturally, emotionally and economically. If they like, the English could ask to become part of the United States."" - Alisdair Dale, Orpington, England Ken McGoogan thinks Scotland should become Canada's 11th province ""If Scotland and Canada were to join, it would be the perfect matrimony... Not only are Canada and Scotland similar in geographical terms (both being cold and beautiful) but also the friendly people of Canada would be welcomed with open arms in Scotland."" - Natalie Rosie, Dunfermline, Scotland ""To hear this idea put forward really makes a Scots descendent day dream about the possibilities! ...I'll gladly open my door and show them our famous Scottish-Canadian hospitality. Free of charge, naturally!"" - Jason MacGregor, Montreal, Canada ""At least someone would then listen to me playing the pipes! Besides, I actually like haggis and the Scottish hills. Some of my fondest memories occurred during visits to Scotland as a child to the farm my grandfather worked on."" - John McCubbin, Toronto, Ontario ""Geographical boundaries don't matter so much these days. What the people of a nation value does, identity does, and Scotland, for a very long time has not had the same values as England. As a province of Canada, Scotland would be treated better than it is now."" - B Whickham, Gloucester, England MPs call for immigration devolution ""Canada and Scotland has so many deep and historic ties. We would be with our people, and peoples of a like mind, we would have the freedoms we require, yet still be part of a greater community, one that would not throw away or ignore our wishes."" - Symon Kielg, Edinburgh, Scotland Some responses were edited for length.

How powerful is 'mother of all bombs'?,"A MOAB test detonation in Florida in 2003 The US military has just dropped its largest conventional (that is non-nuclear) bomb for the first time in combat, on Afghanistan's eastern province of Nangarhar. The GBU-43/B Massive Ordnance Air Blast Bomb (MOAB) - or, in military speak, Mother of All Bombs - was launched on Thursday. The target was said to be a network of tunnels operated by the so-called Islamic State in Achin district. As a non-nuclear weapon, use of the MOAB does not necessarily require approval by the US president. This video can not be played Watch 2003 footage of the GBU-43/B Massive Ordnance Air Blast Bomb (MOAB) being tested It is a huge weapon - a 30ft (9m), 21,600lb (9,800kg), GPS-guided munition that is dropped from the cargo doors of an MC-130 transport plane and detonates shortly before it hits the ground. The MOAB falls from the aircraft on a pallet, which is then tugged aside by a parachute allowing the weapon to glide down, stabilised and directed by four grid-like fins. Its principal effect is a massive blast wave - said to stretch for a mile in every direction - created by 18,000lb of TNT. The bomb's thin aluminium casing was designed specifically to maximise the blast radius. The MOAB is prepared for testing at the Eglin Air Force Base, Florida The bomb is designed to damage underground facilities and tunnels. The weapon was developed for use in the Iraq war - at a reported cost of $16m (Â£13m) each - and was first tested in 2003, but never used in action - until now. And yet, the MOAB is not the US military's heaviest non-nuclear bomb. That distinction belongs to the Massive Ordnance Penetrator, or MOP, a bunker-buster which weighs a colossal 30,000lb. This video can not be played North Korea 'must be well aware' of what else is in the US armoury Russia has developed its own massive conventional bomb, nicknamed the Father Of All Bombs. The FOAB is a kind of fuel-air bomb, technically known as a thermobaric weapon. Thermobaric bombs generally detonate in two stages: a small blast creates a cloud of explosive material which is then ignited, generating a devastating pressure wave. A significant part of the effect of weapons like the MOAB is said to be psychological - to instil terror by the massive force of the blast. Its development followed the use of similar weapons including the BLU-82 Daisy Cutter, a 15,000lb bomb designed in part to flatten a section of forest to carve out a helicopter landing pad. The MOAB was developed by the Alabama-based aeronautics company Dynetics. The 21,600lb (9,800kg) bomb has never been used in combat before 'Bunker Buster' even bigger than MOAB.

Declan McKenna: Bringing back the protest song,"Declan McKenna signed his record deal amid the mud at Glastonbury Seventeen-year-old Declan McKenna has emerged as a fresh and intelligent voice in indie-pop, unafraid to tackle the big topics. His breakthrough singleBrazil,externaladdressed how construction work for the 2014 World Cup destroyed dozens of local communities. Last year'sParacetamol,externalwas inspired by the story ofLeelah Alcorn, a transgender teen in Ohio, who committed suicide after being sent for Christian conversion therapy. ""I just didn't realise that stuff like that was still going on,"" says the singer, who grew up in Hertfordshire. ""Recently, we've hadthe bathroom billand all these sorts of things. I wanted to write something against that."" This video can not be played Declan McKenna performs Paracetamol in session for BBC Music Introducing McKenna got his big break when he won Glastonbury's Emerging Talent Competition in 2015, and signed his record deal at the festival later that year, knee-deep in mud. Since then, he's released a series of singles tackling religion (Bethlehem,external), xenophobia in the media (Isombard,external), and being part of a voiceless generation (The Kids Don't Wanna Come Home,external). Crucially, they're all fizzing alt-pop concoctions that never patronise or preach - they simply get on with the business of being top-notch indie anthems. He's just announced his debut album, What Do You Think About The Car, which will be released on 21 July - and was overseen by producer James Ford (Arctic Monkeys, Florence + The Machine, Foals). Ahead of the release, McKenna sat down to discuss his inspirations, being patronised by the press and his penchant for dungarees. Why is your album called What Do You Think About The Car? It's from a home video when I was four years old. We'd just got a new car and I was stood in front of my grandma's house. On the video, my sister goes, ""Dec! What do you think about the car?"" And I go, ""I think it's really good, and now I'm going to sing my new album!"" That was my first reference to making an album - and we've sampled it on the record. So you've been planning this ever since? Yeah! I mean, at the end of the video, I start singing a Busted song. I don't think I knew what album meant, but it's just a really funny, cute thing about my roots and where it's all come from. It just made sense. What were your early songs like? Not very good! There was about two albums' worth of demos online before I released Brazil - which I took down soon after. I was trying to be Sufjan Stevens but on the most basic music software you can get. I was trying very hard. They're... erm, interesting. This video can not be played Declan McKenna performs Brazil in session for BBC Music Introducing What prompted you to send Brazil in to Glastonbury's Emerging Talent competition? I'd been entering competitions forever. It just so happened that this was the one that got picked up - which was awesome because obviously Glastonbury is an enormous festival. How did you find playing there? I was pretty young, I was 16, so it was just unreal. I played the shows and got signed to Columbia Records there as well. Really? Yeah, the guys at Columbia said, ""Let's sign at Glastonbury,"" because it was more exciting than doing it in an office or whatever. And then we just went out and had a bit of a party. So you have a legally-binding contract that's completely covered in mud... Well, it was raining at the time! I think they kept it in in some foil or something, and then it was taken out for 10 seconds, like, ""Sign this! Sign this!"" And then it was done. A lot of your singles deal with serious topics. What led you down that path? I think, primarily, just not having much to write about! I was in school, I didn't have a girlfriend, I didn't have anything going on, really, except exams. So that's what pushed me to write about stuff that doesn't necessarily impact me directly, but which I think needs to be talked about. This video can not be played Declan McKenna performs Isombard on the BBC Introducing Stage at Radio 1's Big Weekend 2016 I read a lot of articles where the journalist seemed surprised someone your age would write about such serious subjects. That's quite condescending. Yeah, I think so. A lot of the stuff I'm talking about is politically engaged, but I'm not by any means the most articulate or intelligent young person I know. There's nothing exceptional in talking about these things. I just do it and I put it in pop songs. Kids Don't Wanna Come Home is an interesting song. You're both cynical about the state of the world and optimistic for it's future. Yeah, 100%. It's about wanting to be part of a powerful and intelligent young generation - who stand up against these negative things we're shown incessantly on our phones. There's a lot of confusing information out there - but I'd like to be hopeful in a world that's often thought to be in despair. Were you too young to vote in the referendum? I was. What did you think of the result? My friends and I were, to a fair extent, ticked off. I wouldn't have voted in favour of Brexit if I was able to vote. Now I'm 18, I feel just as informed now to make a decision as I was a couple of months ago. Just on a personal level, as a touring musician, it's going to be a pain in the arse. The teenager has been playing guitar since he was nine years old Musically, who's the gold standard? Who would you like to emulate? David Bowie. Yeah? Wow! That's a lofty goal. I mean, you have to try and make the best music you can, and you're not going to do that by emulating something you don't believe is the best. And I think David Bowie's music, in a lot of senses, is the peak of music. Obviously, I don't think I am as good as him but I'd like to be. I'd like to be able to make something as good as Hunky Dory or Young Americans. Which Bowie album are you on the level of right now? Probably none of them. Maybe Earthling if I'm lucky. I don't think it's my favourite Bowie album by a long stretch but it's still there, it still deserves a place in my heart. Finally, I have to ask about the dungarees. You've been rocking them for a while now... I just like a good pair of dungarees. It's comfortable, it's versatile, it looks good with anything. I'm a fan. And there's a handy pocket at the front for snacks. I've got loads of pockets. Pockets galore - that's my nickname on the street.

Reality Check: What are 'ordinary working families'?,"Reality Check says:The government defines ""ordinary working families"" as those that are not eligible for pupil premium but have below average incomes. It believes that accounts for about one third of all pupils in England, but this calculation is a work in progress. Education Secretary Justine Greening on Thursday kicked off a consultation on plans for grammar schools in England, saying that they must do more to help ""ordinary working families"" as the government pushes ahead with plans to allow more selective schools to open. There is no official definition of an ""ordinary working family"" but Ms Greening said on the Today Programme: ""They don't perhaps qualify for free school meals - for pupil premium - but actually they are growing up in families that are below median incomes."" The household earning the median income is the one for which half of families have a higher income and half have lower. The Pupil Premium is a pot of money set aside for children who are in care, eligible for free school meals or have had free school meals at any point in the last six years. Pupils are eligible for free school meals if their family is on one of a range of benefits or has a household income of less than Â£16,190. So, if earning above Â£16,190 puts you at the bottom end of the ""ordinary working families"" definition, how is the government defining the top end of the range? Thepaper published on Wednesday,externalincluded the first attempt by government statisticians to come up with figures that set out how many children from different income brackets go to grammar schools. In the past, the only figures to help with this have been those covering how many children eligible for pupil premium go to particular schools, so expanding these statistics is an ambitious project. What the statisticians have done is to attempt to match individual pupils in schools with their families' income through looking at tax payments and tax credits details. These figures have then been adjusted to take into account things like household size, because if there are two families with identical household incomes, one of which has one child and the other has four children, their standards of living will not be the same. Taking all these adjustments into account, the median household income comes out as Â£20,000. However, some families earning more than Â£20,000 in total will still fall within the definition of an ordinary working family. For example, a single parent's income would be adjusted upwards, so it could be compared directly with the standard of living for a couple. For a two-parent family with two children, the government considers median income to be Â£33,000. The government says 35% of all pupils in England, which is 2.5 million children fall into its definition of coming from ordinary working families, because they fall below the median income but are not eligible for pupil premium. The government is consulting on how to improve the methodology because, for example, the income figures do not currently include households' earnings from self-employment. They also plan to adjust for housing costs in different parts of England. The consultation closes on 30 June. This new analysis has beenwelcomed as providing more detail,external, although there have been warnings from some education groups that the new work on ordinary working families will reduce the focus on the disadvantaged families who are eligible for pupil premium.

The multi-skilled life-saving photographer,"Charlie Chan says both of his careers are about people Why settle for just the day job? Charlie Chan is a breast cancer and melanoma surgeon. He is also a rock star photographer. ""My patients always come first so I work full-time as a surgeon and photography is my night job,"" he says. ""I decided to become a surgeon at the age of 12 and concentrated on that."" But photography had been a passion of his since he was 15, and so he started smuggling his Leica camera into gigs. He got his first press pass from the Cheltenham Jazz Festival and started music photography work 10 years ago. His subjects include musicians Jamie Cullum, Gregory Porter and Wilko Johnson, who was encouraged by Mr Chan to seek a second opinion after he had received a terminal pancreatic cancer diagnosis in 2013. Mr Chan arranged for Johnson to see surgeon Emmanuel Huguet, who later operated to remove the tumour and save his life. Charlie Chan with musician Wilko Johnson (c) and Emmanuel Huguet, the surgeon who performed Johnson's life-saving operation You would think that being a surgeon would be more than enough career-wise for most people, so why pursue another profession? Mr Chan says he uses similar skills in both professions. When shooting in black and white, he sees ""light and composition which helps my day job, when performing a breast reconstruction, as you appreciate light and form in the same way"". For Mr Chan, both careers are about people. He wants his photos to tell a story and for the ""viewer to be there in the moment"", while he says a rewarding and wonderful part about being a surgeon is being able to share good news with his patients who are ""very brave in the face of adversity"". Jamie Cullum and Gregory Porter have been snapped by Mr Chan Mr Chan is not alone in his ""dual career"". While some people take more than one job out of financial necessity, many people are doing so out of choice and for the challenge. Professional networking website LinkedIn has seen a growing trend in the registering of ""multiple"", ""dual"" and ""portfolio"" career descriptions.

The Reverend Rupert Toovey says his secular work is as vocational as his work as a deacon, with each supporting the other. From his late teens, his faith and auctioneering work went hand in hand. ""To serve and listen to people has been a constant thread,"" he says. ""Each role is simultaneously rewarding and vocational."" On visits to people's homes to view antiques, Mr Toovey says: ""The objects reflect the patchwork of their lives and it is a privilege to be invited to share these precious moments with them. ""As with the priestly work, I accompany people in profound moments of change in their lives in a particularly personal and private way.""

The majority of people Mr Toovey attends to, baptises and marries, are people he has met through the network of his business life, including the Lord Mayor of Westminster.

In 2007, New York Times columnist Marci Alboher popularised the term ""slash careers"" - as in surgeon/photographer - citing creative fulfilment and diverse skillsets as benefits for employers and employees.

Easter crackers - spring's answer to Christmas?,"There was a time when Easter meant a Sunday roast, strange homemade bonnets, a visit to Church and lots of chocolate. But with shops now offering trees, wreaths and crackers, is it becoming spring's answer to Christmas? Fresh flowers. White napkins. Fruit tarts. The dinner table for Good Housekeeping's Easter photo shoot was light, bright, and traditional. But look closely, and there's something unusual on the plates: sky blue Easter crackers. Carolyn Bailey is homes and garden editor for the magazine. She said more people were buying decorations for Easter than ever before. ""Easter is becoming like a second Christmas,"" she said. Retailers have hopped on the trend. A number of supermarkets - including Sainsbury's, Tesco and Waitrose - are stocking Easter crackers this year. Poundland have also got in on the action, offering everything from bunny banners to carrot-shaped fairy lights. Meanwhile Tesco, M&S and John Lewis are selling egg-speckled wreaths. Can British Easter eggs conquer the world? Easter getaway: When is busiest by road, rail and air Eggs are no longer just made of chocolate, but are painted and covered in beads, sparkles or pom-poms. And where do you hang these egg-cellent trinkets? On an Easter tree of course. Varying arrays of twigs - often painted white - are laden with colourful eggs and bunnies. There are more than 16,000 posts for#Eastertree,externalon Instagram and thousands more on Pinterest. And if your garden doesn't have much in the way of Instagram-able branches, a number of High Street stores are selling the skeletal trees ready for decorating. Decorated eggs are not a new phenomenon. House of FabergÃ© set the standard back in 1842. Eggs themselves have been associated with the Christian tradition for even longer. They symbolise both new life and the empty tomb. Canon Sarah Rowland Jones is from the Church in Wales. ""In many ways Easter is the more important Christian festival,"" she says. ""People should be given cause to remember what it's all about. ""If making more of Easter makes people look beyond the caricature of Christianity - at what is at the heart of what more than two billion people around the world practise - then it's a good thing."" An Easter wreath Easter continues to be the second-biggest retail event in the UK after Christmas. Market researcher, Mintel, estimated Easter to be worth Â£550 million to UK retailers in 2016. Craft giant, Hobbycraft has seen sales of its Easter range soar almost 44% compared to last year. Included in the range is a faux grass bunny which has completely sold out. Meanwhile, fillable egg characters are up 93% compared to 2016. These green bunnies - for the home or outside - are sold out Anna Protherough, a seasonal buyer for the retailer, said: ""More and more, people are looking for reasons to celebrate and because of this, seasonal events such as Halloween and Easter are becoming bigger and bigger."" Hobbycraft says ""decorating the home for Easter is bigger than ever before"" and that homeowners are inspired by crafters like American businesswoman Martha Stewart.
