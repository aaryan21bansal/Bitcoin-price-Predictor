School cash 'horse-trading' criticised,"Former Education Secretary Justine Greening says it is ""wholly inappropriate"" for school funding decisions to have become part of a legacy wrangle in the final days of Theresa May's premiership. There have been reports that the prime minister is planning a significant increase in spending on schools in England before leaving Downing Street. But Ms Greening says such a last-minute political intervention is ""no way to deal with the question of long-term schools and education funding"". School funding is ""far too important to be horse-traded like this"", said the Conservative MP. There have been long-running protests by school leaders over funding shortages - including a protest march by head teachers through Westminster and letters sent to millions of parents. They have warned of staff cuts and having to reduce what schools can provide in terms of subjects and support. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has said that schools have faced an 8% real-terms cut in per-pupil funding since 2010. Head teachers staged a ""relentlessly reasonable"" protest march in Westminster A response from the government was expected in the next public spending review - but ahead of that, Conservative leadership contender Boris Johnson has promised to boost school spending by about Â£5bn. There are reports in the Financial Times suggesting Mrs May is planning to pre-empt this, with an announcement of extra school spending of up to Â£3bn. The Times suggests that funding of Â£5bn could be made available. There are also reports that the Treasury has resisted major spending commitments, which will stretch beyond the current prime minister's time in office and ahead of decisions about Brexit. But a No 10 source urged caution about such speculation - and said nothing had been finalised. Â£3.8bn needed to reverse school cuts Heads warn of Â£5.7bn school funding gap School spending on pupils cut by 8%, says IFS Schools facing 'financial cliff edge' Ms Greening, education secretary until the Cabinet reshuffle of January 2018, criticised the funding dispute as an ""unedifying spectacle all round"". ""School funding issues should have been recognised by No 10 and No 11 much earlier,"" she said. There was also a question about how a one-off announcement would work for schools - when any rise in per-pupil spending would have to be sustained in subsequent years. Such funding uncertainty would make it ""very hard for teachers and schools to plan ahead"", said Ms Greening. Schools have warned about the pressures of funding shortages Jules White, the West Sussex head teacher who has organised the Worth Less? funding campaign, said he shared Ms Greening's concerns about such ""ad hoc school funding announcements"". He said the government has been in ""abject denial about the state of school budgets"" and had failed to act - and now seemed to be motivated by internal politics. Mr White said schools needed an extra Â£5bn to reverse funding cuts - and not ""sticking plasters"". A government spokesman said funding for schools in England was ""at its highest ever level"". ""But we know schools face budgeting challenges, and the education secretary has said he'll back head teachers with the resources they need.""

Heads warn of Â£5.7bn funding gap,"Heads say that inadequate funding for schools is adding to the pressure on teachers Head teachers say England's schools face a Â£5.7bn funding shortfall. Without an injection of extra cash, head teachers' leaders say many schools will have to make ""deeper cuts"" or ""face insolvency"". The funding warnings were made at the annual conference of the Association of School and College Leaders. Education Secretary Damian Hinds told the conference he heard the message on school funding problems ""loud and clear"". Speaking to the head teachers' conference in Birmingham, Mr Hinds said he realised that schools were under financial pressure and faced ""hard choices"". He promised that he would be ""doggedly determined"" and make the ""strongest possible case"" to the Treasury in the next spending review. Damian Hinds is setting up an advisory group to address stress and improve wellbeing among teachers Mr Hinds, who received polite applause at the end of his speech, said he would ""back heads to have the resources they need"". He said he ""totally recognised the pressure on schools"". The ASCL head teachers' union has calculated how much it believes schools need to solve their funding shortfalls. The heads say there is a Â£5.7bn shortfall in per-pupil funding for 2019-20, which they argue should rise as an allocation to schools of Â£40.2bn. Head teachers campaigning over funding shortages have pointed to the evidence of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, which has said that per-pupil funding has fallen by 8% since 2010. 'Pupil poverty' pressure on school cash Head teachers protest over funding shortages Schools facing a financial cliff edge They say schools have to cut staff, increase class sizes and stop teaching some subjects. There have been warnings of schools closing for a half-day on Friday to save money. The union's president, Richard Sheriff, said the analysis of what schools needed was to make sure the debate on funding was ""informed by evidence"" rather than ""rhetoric"". Last week a grassroots head teachers' campaign over funding had accused Mr Hinds of ""snubbing"" a request for a meeting. But he told the heads at the conference that he met teachers in schools ""week in and week out"" and heard their concerns about funding. The head teachers' union also heard warnings that schools were having to""pick up the pieces"" for families in poverty. Heads warned that schools were having to act as an ""unofficial emergency service"", providing food and clean clothes for pupils from impoverished families. But they say that such extra welfare support is unaffordable when schools are facing cuts. Mr Hinds also addressed concerns over staff shortages - and spoke of the need to reduce the number of teachers leaving their jobs. He said 33% of new teachers left the profession within five years. The education secretary announced plans for an expert advisory group to help teachers with ""the pressures of the job"". The advisory group, including the mental health charity Mind, will look at ways to improve wellbeing among teachers and tackle stress.

School spending 'really cut',"Schools say the research proves budgets have not been protected The amount of per pupil spending in England's schools has fallen by 8% since 2010, says an analysis by the Institute for Fiscal Studies. The study says rising pupil numbers - and cuts to local authorities and sixth form funding - have seen a real-term reduction in school spending. Heads say it disproves government ""rhetoric"" about record funding levels. The Department for Education says funding will be at its ""highest ever level"", reaching Â£43.5bn by 2020. School leaders have been protesting that cash shortages have forced them to cut staff and to ask parents for financial assistance - but the government has argued that school funding has been protected. This research from the IFS definitively concludes that total funding per pupil in England has been reduced, when looked at in the round, taking into account changes in pupil numbers and different routes of funding schools and age groups. Head teachers say it should end the government's ""insistence"" that funding had not been reduced. This video can not be played The head of King's school in Wolverhampton says funding problems have meant lost jobs and unrepaired holes in the roof The study says efforts since 2010 to protect school budgets have focused on pupils up to the age of 16 - at the expense of sixth form funding and support through local authorities. Sixth form funding has been cut by 25% and local authority support is down by 55%. Between 2015 and 2017 the core budget up to the age of 16 fell by 4%, says the IFS analysis. When the sharp rise in pupil numbers is also taken into account, the IFS says there has been a 8% overall reduction in the money spent per pupil between 2009-10 and 2017-18. The studycompares school funding in England and Wales- and says because of the greater population surge in England, per pupil funding has fallen more sharply there, with per pupil funding in Wales down by 5% since 2009-10. ""School spending per pupil has fallen by more in England than in Wales over the last eight years, virtually eliminating the gap in spending per pupil between the two countries,"" said Luke Sibieta, research fellow at the IFS. The school with 300 holes in the roof Heads complain of having to ask parents for school funds Number of secondary schools in deficit has trebled Hinds admits funding pressures on schools This analysis on funding comes as schools are anticipating even further financial pressure - with the teachers' pay round expected soon. Geoff Barton, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union, wrote to the education secretary last week warning that unless there was extra funding for teachers' pay, it would be ""catastrophic"" and effectively leave schools insolvent. An above-inflation pay rise, suggested to be in the region of 3.5%, is expected to help tackle a teacher shortage - which the education secretary has said is a""top priority"". King's school in Wolverhampton is the most improved school in its area, but faces cuts in what it can offer Responding to the IFS report, Mr Barton said ""the facts could not be more plain"". ""Despite the government's repeated insistence that it is spending record levels on education, the reality is that it has significantly cut funding per pupil in real terms. ""The scale of these cuts is a devastating indictment of its commitment to education and has put educational standards in jeopardy."" Mr Barton said schools would have ""no choice"" but to cut back on what they were able to offer pupils - and he accused ministers of failing to respond to a ""crisis which has developed under their watch"". Shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, said: ""This analysis is just the latest evidence of the damage that Tory cuts have done to our schools, denying a generation of children the opportunities they deserve."" The Department for Education says that they have moved extra cash into school budgets A Department for Education spokeswoman said that ""School funding in England is at its highest ever level, rising to Â£43.5n by 2020."" ""In fact, analysis from the Institute of Fiscal Studies itself has shown that real terms per pupil funding for 5-16 year olds in England in 2020 will be more than 50% higher than it was in 2000. ""We have also protected the base rate of funding for 16-19 year olds until 2020, worth Â£4,000 per student for 16-17 year olds.""

Schools 'desperately need' cash injection - MPs,"Schools and colleges in England need a ""multi-billion cash injection"" and a long-term approach to funding, say MPs on the Education Select Committee. Its report on school funding confirms the concerns of head teachers and teachers' unions who have protested about worsening budget shortages. The committee found that schools and colleges ""desperately need"" extra cash. A Department for Education spokeswoman accepted that schools were facing ""budgeting challenges"". ASCL head teachers' union leader Geoff Barton, said the report was a ""damning indictment of the government's dreadful record"" on school funding. Robert Halfon, who chairs the committee, said the report showed the need for a ""comprehensive, bottom-up national assessment"" of what it really cost to have an ""education system fit for the 21st Century"". The cross-party report says that schools have faced increased financial pressures from rising numbers of pupils and growing demands, such as supporting more pupils with mental health problems. School cash 'horse-trading' attacked by Greening Heads warn of Â£5.7bn school funding gap School spending on pupils cut by 8%, says IFS MPs say funding ""has not kept pace"" and the government needs to put in more cash. ""The government needs to cover the 8% funding gap currently faced by schools,"" says Mr Halfon, with the report saying this would require a ""Â£3.8bn uplift"". Further education colleges have faced particular problems, says the report, with per student funding falling by 16% in real terms over the past decade for the post-16 age group. The MPs say funding for this age group, in sixth forms and colleges, needs a Â£1bn boost, and the pupil premium, which gives extra support for disadvantaged youngsters, should be extended to 16- to 19-year-olds. The committee's report also calls for extra support for pupils with special needs and disabilities, to tackle a ""projected Â£1.2bn deficit"". There have been long-running protests by school leaders over funding shortages - including a protest march by head teachers through Westminster and letters sent to millions of parents. Jules White, the West Sussex head teacher who organised the WorthLess? school funding protest, said ""a cross-party group of MPs have validated what we have been saying all along - namely that our schools and colleges have been crippled by cuts and rising costs"". Tory leadership contender Boris Johnson has promised increased investment in schools - and there have also been claims that the Prime Minister, Theresa May, wants to announce a funding boost for schools before stepping down. Former Education Secretary Justine Greeningattacked the ""horse-trading"" over school funding, saying it should not be decided by short-term political pressures. Labour's shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, said spending cuts had ""left schools begging parents for donations just to keep the lights on five days a week and pay for basic supplies like pens and paper"". A spokeswoman for the Department for Education said: ""While it is accurate to say that school funding is at its highest level, we do recognise that there are budgeting challenges. ""We are glad to see that school and further education funding is being highlighted as an important issue ahead of the next spending review, where the education secretary will back the sector to have the resources they need.""

No-fault eviction ban 'will hurt tenants',"A government plan to ban no-fault evictions in England will backfire, landlords say, as lower-income tenants will find it harder to rent homes. Proposals to scrapsection 21 notices,externalwould mean landlords could no longer evict tenants without a reason after their fixed-term tenancy period ended. The plan aims to give tenants security and halt ""revenge evictions"" when tenants are thrown out for complaining. But a landlords' trade group says its members will be more choosy over lets. The Residential Landlords Association (RLA) said its survey of 6,400 landlords suggested that 84% of its members would be more selective, picking tenants on higher incomes and leaving those earning less to fight over fewer properties. Where does rent hit young people the hardest in Britain? 'No water and rodents' among student housing gripes Landlords could even decide to let fewer homes to tenants with pets, as they would be considered as carrying a higher risk of causing damage. Housing charity Shelter dismissed the fears, arguing that there had been no such consequences in Scotland since it banned section 21. There are two options for a landlord to ensure tenants leave a property - section 21 when they must give two months' notice but no specific reason at the end of a tenancy, or section eight when they take cases of rent arrears and anti-social behaviour to court. The RLA said the section eight process was lengthy, costly and needed reform before any decision was taken to scrap section 21. Una Walsh, based in Leeds, has 20 properties and had served three section 21 notices in the last five years. All were for rent arrears, and the notices were served after she received professional and legal advice. She said they were used as a ""desperate last resort"". Una Walsh said she would have to rent only to professionals Her properties are mostly three-bedroom family homes and she said the evictions allowed her to re-let the properties swiftly to families who needed them. ""My ethos was local houses for a local person. If they grow up in the neighbourhood, they are settled here,"" the 57-year-old said. However, she feared that slow evictions, during which tenants failed to pay the rent, would mean she would only be able to let to households with two wage earners after 30 years of operating in a different way. The RLA claimed that vulnerable tenants would be most at risk from the tougher selection criteria that landlords would be forced to adopt. The survey suggested that 45% of RLA members would consider selling some of their properties as a result of any section 21 ban, although a survey of intentions does not always happen in reality. Section 21 notices are already banned in Scotland, but the RLA said the Scottish government put far more preparation in place, whereas the authorities in England were ""twisting in the wind"" on policy. It called for wholesale changes to the eviction system, including the introduction of a dedicated housing court. David Smith, policy director at the RLA, said: ""While no landlords should ever abuse the system, it is only right and fair that they can repossess properties swiftly and with certainty in legitimate circumstances."" Some tenants say the system is actually being abused by landlords who kick out tenants following complaints, so-called revenge evictions. Alicia and her boyfriend complained about water damage in their home Earlier this year, 24-year-old Alicia Powelltold the BBChow she was renting a flat in north London with her boyfriend when she noticed a wet patch on the ceiling. The couple complained to their property manager but nothing was done so they said they were going to report it to their local council. Shortly afterwards, they were served with a section 21 notice. Polly Neate, chief executive of Shelter, said: ""The government's plan to scrap no-fault evictions is vital to tackle the turmoil experienced by people up and down the country, especially children and the elderly who are worst affected by sudden evictions. ""Being turfed out of your home for no reason, with no evidence, and with just eight weeks of warning can have devastating consequences. This practice must be consigned to the history books.""

Boeing takes $5bn hit to cover 737 Max crisis,"Boeing is taking a $4.9bn hit to cover costs related to the global grounding of its 737 Max aircraft. The charge is set to wipe out profits when the world's biggest planemaker posts quarterly results next week. In a statement, Boeing also said its ""best estimate at this time"" is that the aircraft will return to service in the last three months of this year. A 737 Max crash in Indonesia in October, and another in Ethiopia in March, killed 346 people in total. Boeing is facing one of the worst crises in its history after regulatorsbanned its best-selling aircraft from flying after the disasters. Boeing crash: I miss them every minute Boeing loses big order for 737 Max aircraft Crash investigators have concentrated their efforts onthe aircraft's control systemand Boeing has been working with regulators toroll out a software upgrade. The manufacturer, facing intense scrutiny over the regulatory clearance for the aircraft to fly, has cut the monthly production rate from 52 to 42 as airlines hold off purchases. Most of the $4.9bn charge will be used to compensate Boeing's customers for schedule disruptions and delays in aircraft deliveries. On Friday, Boeing's share price jumped 4% at the start of trading, a sign that investors seem comfortable with the charge. Analysts knew that Boeing faced a heavy financial cost following the disasters and had been awaiting clarity. In April, Boeing halted share buybacks, and said that the grounding of the 737 Max fleet had cost it an additional charge of at least $1bn so far. Theo Leggett, BBC international business correspondent $5bn, and very probably counting. The money set aside by Boeing is meant to cover compensation for customers who either haven't received their aircraft, or can't use the ones they already have. Airlines who are waiting for overdue deliveries are having to make alternative arrangements, by cancelling services, leasing aircraft from specialist companies, or by keeping older, less fuel-efficient models in service for longer. All three options come at a cost. And for those who already had Max aircraft in service, there will be financing costs that still have to be paid, even when the planes themselves are not earning their keep. Not to mention the money that needs to be spent on maintaining them while they are on the ground. All of this, ultimately, is likely to come back to Boeing. The $5bn figure assumes that the process of approving the Max to go back into service will begin in the autumn. But we have already seen that regulators seem determined to take a very tough line when it comes to ensuring the safety of the aircraft. The schedule could well slip again, and costs rise further. Let's not forget either that lawsuits filed by relatives of accident victims are mounting up, and this charge does not take them into consideration at all. So the final bill for Boeing may well be a lot higher. Boeing chairman and chief executive Dennis Muilenburg, said: ""This is a defining moment for Boeing. Nothing is more important to us than the safety of the flight crews and passengers who fly on our airplanes. ""The Max grounding presents significant headwinds and the financial impact recognised this quarter reflects the current challenges and helps to address future financial risks."" This video can not be played Paul Njoroge's family died in the crash in Ethiopia in March, and he gave moving testimony in the US Congress Boeing said it continues to work with aviation authorities to get the 737 Max back into the air, which it hopes will be in the fourth quarter of 2019. But the statement added: ""This assumption reflects the company's best estimate at this time, but actual timing of return to service could differ from this estimate."" Boeing also warned that if this timetable slips, and its anticipated resumption of deliveries to customers is delayed, that this ""could result in additional financial impact"". However, in a speech on Thursday, the US transportation secretary appeared less certain that the aircraft would be cleared to fly again this year. Elaine L Chao said the Federal Aviation Administration, ""is following a thorough process, rather than a prescribed timeline... the FAA will lift the aircraft's prohibition order when it is deemed safe to do so."" She was not referring directly to Boeing's statement. On Thursday, Southwest Airlines, the biggest user of the 737 Max, joined its US rivals in cancelling more flights until early November. The move also prompted the low-cost carrier to freeze new pilot hiring.

UK 'will have to face consequences of no deal',"This video can not be played Michel Barnier says Theresa May and her ministers never threatened to leave without a deal during negotiations The UK will have to ""face the consequences"" if it opts to leave without a deal, the EU's chief Brexit negotiator has said. Michel Barnier told BBC Panorama the thrice-rejected agreement negotiated by Theresa May was the ""only way to leave the EU in an orderly manner"". He also insisted Mrs May and her ministers ""never"" told him during Brexit talks she might opt for no deal. Publicly, Mrs May has always insisted no deal is better than a bad deal. Meanwhile, the Office for Budget Responsibilityhas said the UK will fall into recession next yearif there is a no-deal Brexit. The fiscal watchdog said economic growth would fall by 2% by the end of 2020 if it left the bloc without an agreement. In his first UK broadcast interview - conducted in May before the start of the Conservative leadership contest - Mr Barnier was asked what would happen if the UK ""just tore up the membership card"" for the EU. ""The UK will have to face the consequences,"" he replied. Asked whether the UK had ever genuinely threatened to leave in such a way with no deal, Mr Barnier said: ""I think that the UK side, which is well informed and competent and knows the way we work on the EU side, knew from the very beginning that we've never been impressed by such a threat. ""It's not useful to use it."" Panorama: Britain's Brexit Crisis will be broadcast on Thursday at 21:00 BST. Conservative Party leadership contender Jeremy Hunt told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the fact the EU ""never believed that no deal was a credible threat"" was ""one of our mistakes in the last two years"". He said while there will be economic consequences to no deal, ""we are much better prepared for no deal than we were before"". He said the issue of the Northern Ireland border could be solved with ""existing technology"" and the controversial Irish backstop, which aims to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland, ""isn't going to happen"". Former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith, a key figure in Boris Johnson's leadership campaign, accused Mr Barnier of trying to ""threaten"" the UK. He said Mr Barnier's remarks were an indictment of Britain's negotiating strategy and showed ""how useless"" Mrs May's approach had been. Leadership frontrunner Mr Johnson was asked for an interview by Panorama, but he declined. Elsewhere in the programme, Mrs May's de facto deputy David Lidington revealed that a senior EU official made a secret offer to the UK to put Brexit on hold for five years and negotiate a ""new deal for Europe"". Mr Lidington said the offer was passed on in 2018 by Martin Selmayr, a senior aide to EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker. ""Martin sort of said, 'Look, why don't we have a deal whereby we just put all this on ice for five years?' ""Let's see how things go, let's get the UK involved with France and Germany, let's see how the dust settles and let's talk about whether we can come to a new deal for Europe.'"" 10 things that stopped Brexit happening 10 ways no-deal Brexit could affect you Do MPs have the power to stop a no-deal Brexit? No-deal Brexit 'threat to UK research' In his own interview for the programme - also recorded in May - Mr Selmayr said he was ""very certain"" the UK was not ready to leave without a deal before the original Brexit deadline in March this year. ""We have seen what has been prepared on our side of the border for a hard Brexit. We don't see the same level of preparation on the other side of the border,"" he added. This video can not be played Timmermans: ""It's like Lance Corporal Jones: 'Don't panic, don't panic'... running around like idiots"" In another interview for the programme, the EU Commission's First Vice-President, Frans Timmermans, said UK ministers were ""running around like idiots"" when they arrived to negotiate Brexit in 2017. Mr Timmermans said while he expected a ""Harry Potter-like book of tricks"" from ministers, instead they were like a character from from Dad's Army. In an interview in March 2019 with the BBC's Nick Robinson, Mr Timmermans said he found it ""shocking"" how unprepared the UK team was when it began negotiations. ""We thought they are so brilliant,"" he said. ""That in some vault somewhere in Westminster there will be a Harry Potter-like book with all the tricks and all the things in it to do."" But after seeing the then-Brexit Secretary David Davis - who resigned over his disagreements with the deal - speaking in public, his mind changed. ""I saw him not coming, not negotiating, grandstanding elsewhere [and] I thought, 'Oh my God, they haven't got a plan, they haven't got a plan.' ""That was really shocking, frankly, because the damage if you don't have a plan... ""Time's running out and you don't have a plan. It's like Lance Corporal Jones, you know, 'Don't panic, don't panic!' Running around like idiots."" Mr Timmermans - interviewed two months before Mrs May announced her resignation - also criticised Boris Johnson's approach to Brexit negotiations from when they began. ""Perhaps I am being a bit harsh, but it is about time we became a bit harsh. I am not sure he was being genuine,"" he said. ""I have always had the impression he is playing games."" Negotiations between the UK and EU began in 2017 after Prime Minister Theresa May triggered the Article 50 process to leave the bloc. At the end of 2018, a withdrawal agreement was settled between the two sides and EU officials said the matter was closed. But MPs voted against the plan three times, which led to a number of delays to the exit date - now set for 31 October. Is the EU really united over Brexit?

Greening attacks school cash 'horse-trading',"Former Education Secretary Justine Greening says it is ""wholly inappropriate"" for school funding decisions to have become part of a legacy wrangle in the final days of Theresa May's premiership. There have been reports that the prime minister is planning a significant increase in spending on schools in England before leaving Downing Street. But Ms Greening says such a last-minute political intervention is ""no way to deal with the question of long-term schools and education funding"". School funding is ""far too important to be horse-traded like this"", said the Conservative MP. There have been long-running protests by school leaders over funding shortages - including a protest march by head teachers through Westminster and letters sent to millions of parents. They have warned of staff cuts and having to reduce what schools can provide in terms of subjects and support. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has said that schools have faced an 8% real-terms cut in per-pupil funding since 2010. Head teachers staged a ""relentlessly reasonable"" protest march in Westminster A response from the government was expected in the next public spending review - but ahead of that, Conservative leadership contender Boris Johnson has promised to boost school spending by about Â£5bn. There are reports in the Financial Times suggesting Mrs May is planning to pre-empt this, with an announcement of extra school spending of up to Â£3bn. The Times suggests that funding of Â£5bn could be made available. There are also reports that the Treasury has resisted major spending commitments, which will stretch beyond the current prime minister's time in office and ahead of decisions about Brexit. But a No 10 source urged caution about such speculation - and said nothing had been finalised. Â£3.8bn needed to reverse school cuts Heads warn of Â£5.7bn school funding gap School spending on pupils cut by 8%, says IFS Schools facing 'financial cliff edge' Ms Greening, education secretary until the Cabinet reshuffle of January 2018, criticised the funding dispute as an ""unedifying spectacle all round"". ""School funding issues should have been recognised by No 10 and No 11 much earlier,"" she said. There was also a question about how a one-off announcement would work for schools - when any rise in per-pupil spending would have to be sustained in subsequent years. Such funding uncertainty would make it ""very hard for teachers and schools to plan ahead"", said Ms Greening. Schools have warned about the pressures of funding shortages Jules White, the West Sussex head teacher who has organised the Worth Less? funding campaign, said he shared Ms Greening's concerns about such ""ad hoc school funding announcements"". He said the government has been in ""abject denial about the state of school budgets"" and had failed to act - and now seemed to be motivated by internal politics. Mr White said schools needed an extra Â£5bn to reverse funding cuts - and not ""sticking plasters"". A government spokesman said funding for schools in England was ""at its highest ever level"". ""But we know schools face budgeting challenges, and the education secretary has said he'll back head teachers with the resources they need.""

Heads warn of Â£5.7bn school funding gap,"Heads say that inadequate funding for schools is adding to the pressure on teachers Head teachers say England's schools face a Â£5.7bn funding shortfall. Without an injection of extra cash, head teachers' leaders say many schools will have to make ""deeper cuts"" or ""face insolvency"". The funding warnings were made at the annual conference of the Association of School and College Leaders. Education Secretary Damian Hinds told the conference he heard the message on school funding problems ""loud and clear"". Speaking to the head teachers' conference in Birmingham, Mr Hinds said he realised that schools were under financial pressure and faced ""hard choices"". He promised that he would be ""doggedly determined"" and make the ""strongest possible case"" to the Treasury in the next spending review. Damian Hinds is setting up an advisory group to address stress and improve wellbeing among teachers Mr Hinds, who received polite applause at the end of his speech, said he would ""back heads to have the resources they need"". He said he ""totally recognised the pressure on schools"". The ASCL head teachers' union has calculated how much it believes schools need to solve their funding shortfalls. The heads say there is a Â£5.7bn shortfall in per-pupil funding for 2019-20, which they argue should rise as an allocation to schools of Â£40.2bn. Head teachers campaigning over funding shortages have pointed to the evidence of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, which has said that per-pupil funding has fallen by 8% since 2010. 'Pupil poverty' pressure on school cash Head teachers protest over funding shortages Schools facing a financial cliff edge They say schools have to cut staff, increase class sizes and stop teaching some subjects. There have been warnings of schools closing for a half-day on Friday to save money. The union's president, Richard Sheriff, said the analysis of what schools needed was to make sure the debate on funding was ""informed by evidence"" rather than ""rhetoric"". Last week a grassroots head teachers' campaign over funding had accused Mr Hinds of ""snubbing"" a request for a meeting. But he told the heads at the conference that he met teachers in schools ""week in and week out"" and heard their concerns about funding. The head teachers' union also heard warnings that schools were having to""pick up the pieces"" for families in poverty. Heads warned that schools were having to act as an ""unofficial emergency service"", providing food and clean clothes for pupils from impoverished families. But they say that such extra welfare support is unaffordable when schools are facing cuts. Mr Hinds also addressed concerns over staff shortages - and spoke of the need to reduce the number of teachers leaving their jobs. He said 33% of new teachers left the profession within five years. The education secretary announced plans for an expert advisory group to help teachers with ""the pressures of the job"". The advisory group, including the mental health charity Mind, will look at ways to improve wellbeing among teachers and tackle stress.

Trump - I disagree with 'send her back' chant,"This video can not be played Trump on ""Send her back"": ""I disagree with the chant"" President Donald Trump has disavowed the ""send her back"" chants directed at Democratic congresswoman Ilhan Omar by his supporters at a campaign rally. Ms Omar is a US citizen who emigrated from Somalia with her family after fleeing the country's civil war. The chants, which came after Mr Trump criticised Ms Omar and three other congresswomen, were widely condemned, including by some Republicans. ""I was not happy with it. I disagree with it,"" Mr Trump said of the chant. He did not elaborate on what he disagreed with. ""It was quite a chant and I felt a little bit badly about it,"" Mr Trump told reporters on Thursday. ""I started speaking very quickly but it started up rather fast, as you probably noticed."" The controversial chants took place at Mr Trump's campaign rally in North Carolina. Mr Trump was cheered on by the crowd of thousands as he again accused Ms Omar and her fellow congresswomen Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rashia Tlaib, Ayanna Pressley - known as ""the squad"" - of hating America. Ahead of the rally, a bid to impeach Mr Trump was blocked in Congress. Critics say it echoed the ""lock her up"" phrase adopted by his supporters against Hillary Clinton in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election. Do Trump rally taunts mark new strategy? Who are the congresswomen known as the squad? The chant comes as tensions escalate between the president and the four Democratic congresswomen over recent tweets, in which Mr Trump told the then four politicians to ""go back"" to their countries. This video can not be played ""Send her back"" chants at Trump rally Ms Omar told reporters on Thursday:  ""Every single person who is in this country, who's aspiring to become part of the American fabric understands that nothing this president says should be taken to heart."" ""As he's spewing his fascist ideology on stage, telling US citizens to go back because they don't agree with his detrimental policies for our country, we tell people that here in the US dissent is patriotic, here in the US disagreement is welcome."" On Wednesday, Ms Omar tweeted lines from Maya Angelou's poem Still I Rise and later shared a photo of herself in the House of Representatives saying, ""I am where I belong"". Allow Twitter content?

Some conservatives have also censured the use of the phrase.

This video can not be played Democratic congresswoman Rashida Tlaib: ""I'm dealing with the biggest bully I've ever had to deal with"" ""There's no place for that kind of talk,"" Mr Emmer said,according to Politico,external.

North Carolina congressman Mark Walker said that he ""struggled"" with the chant and that the focus should be on ""her history, words & actions"" instead of ""phrasing that's painful to our friends in the minority communities"". His fellow Republican Adam Kinzinger said the chants were ""ugly"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Conservative commentator Ben Shapiro said ""chanting for her deportation based on her exercise of the First Amendment is disgusting"". Senator Lindsay Graham, a vocal Trump supporter, defended the president, though he said he wished Mr Trump would focus on ""policies not the personality"". ""I've said before that if you're a Somali refugee wearing a Maga hat, he doesn't want to send you back. You'd probably have dinner at the White House,"" Mr Graham told reporters. Republican leader Mitch McConnell told the Fox Business Network on Thursday that Mr Trump is ""on to something"" by attacking the four congresswomen as their policies will be important in the upcoming election. ""We're in a big debate now and next year about what we want America to be like. Do we really think socialism applies here at a time of great prosperity, 50-year-low unemployment?"" Three years ago, crowds at Donald Trump rallies called for the imprisonment of a political adversary. On Wednesday, they chanted for a member of the opposition party to be expelled from the country. These are not behaviours emblematic of a healthy, well-functioning democracy. The president's defenders have parsed his incendiary language in an effort to explain why telling people to ""go back"" to the ""totally broken and crime infested places from which they came"" is not simply the latest iteration of age-old racist invective. It was, they insist, just a Trumpian twist on ""love it or leave it"" sloganeering. When the rhetoric filters down to the president's vocal crowds, however, such nuance is lost. Mr Trump is an instinctual politician who senses weakness and opportunity and often acts before a strategy is fully formed. The goal, however, is clear. He is both trying to sow divisions within Democratic ranks and rile up a base whose enthusiastic turnout will be needed in the coming election. Such a course is not without risk, however. His actions could motivate and unify opponents as much as they do his base. It's a recipe for a toxic, divisive campaign that will get ugly - and fast. In an interview withthe Daily Mail,externaljust before the Greenville rally, Mr Trump said he was ""not unhappy"" with the way the row has played out and said he believes he is ""winning the political fight...by a lot"". ""I'm not relishing the fight,"" Mr Trump said. ""I'm enjoying it because I have to get the word out to the American people. And you have to enjoy what you do. I enjoy what I do."" In a series of tweets on Sunday, the president said  the four congresswomen - who he did not identify - ""originally came from countries whose governments are a complete and total catastrophe"" and should ""go back"". The president has denied accusations that the tweets were racist, but the Democrat-controlledHouse passed a symbolic resolutiondenouncing Mr Trump's ""racist comments that have legitimised fear and hatred of New Americans and people of colour"". A July pollby the Pew Research Center,externalfound that while 62% of overall Americans believe openness to people from around the world is ""essential to who we are as a nation"", 57% of Republicans said the US risks ""losing our identity as a nation"" if it is too open. Earlier on Wednesday, a bid to launch impeachment proceedings against Mr Trump was blocked in the US House of Representatives after it failed to win enough support, with only 95 Democrats voting in favour.

Death penalty for Morocco tourist murderers,"Rachid Afatti (L) videoed Younes Ouaziyad (C) and Abdessamad Ejjoud (R) as they carried out the killings Three Islamic State group supporters who murdered two Scandinavian hikers in Morocco have been sentenced to death. The verdicts for ringleader Abdessamad Ejjoud, Younes Ouaziyad and Rachid Afatti follow petitions on social media calling for their execution. Louisa Vesterager Jespersen, 24, from Denmark, and Maren Ueland, 28, from Norway, were found beheaded in the High Atlas mountains in December. If the executions go ahead, they will be the first in Morocco since 1993. That year saw the country introduce a moratorium on capital punishment. During the trial, it emerged that Ejjoud, 25, and Ouaziyad, 27, had beheaded the two women while Afatti, 33, filmed the murders on his mobile phone. Maren Ueland, left, and Louisa Vesterager Jespersen were studying to be tour guides ""The most just thing would be to give these beasts the death penalty they deserve,"" Helle Petersen, Ms Jespersen's mother, said in a letter that was read out in court last week. The verdict follows an 11-week trial in SalÃ© near the capital Rabat. Ejjoud, an underground imam, admitted killing one of the two women in May. ""I beheaded one of them... I regret it,"" the street vendor told the court. French media report that Ejjoud had served a prison sentence in Morocco for trying to join the Islamic State (IS) group in Syria, and was released in 2015. Afatti filmed the attack on his mobile phone. A video appearing to show one of the women being beheaded was shared online by IS supporters. Police in Norway saidthe video was almost certainly real. The suspects arrived in court under heavy guard The three men all said they were IS supporters, although IS has not said it was behind the killings. In court, Ejjoud said: ""We loved Islamic State and prayed to God for it."" Their defence team said there were ""mitigating circumstances on account of their precarious social conditions and psychological disequilibrium"", AFP reported. They said the men had a ""very low"" level of education and came from modest backgrounds. Kevin Zoller Guervos, a Spanish-Swiss convert to Islam, was the only non-Moroccan on trial. He was accused of teaching the main suspects how to use an encrypted messaging service and to use weapons. He was sentenced to 20 years in prison for ""joining a terrorist group"", AFP reported. Read more about the Islamic State group: Iraq court sentences French IS members to death Caliphate defeated but IS remains a threat How many IS foreign fighters are left? Morocco's anti-terror chief, quoted by the AFP news agency, said the group was inspired by IS - but had no contact with IS militants in combat zones. The prosecution labelled the three killers as ""bloodthirsty monsters"" after the autopsy report found 23 injuries on Ms Jespersen's decapitated body and seven on that of Ms Ueland. Ms Jespersen and Ms Ueland were flatmates at Norway's Bo University. Their bodies were found on 17 December in a tent in an isolated area near Mount Toubkal, Morocco's highest peak and a popular destination for hikers. Both had taken full precautions ahead of their trip, Ms Ueland's mother said last year. The victims' bodies were found in an isolated area in Morocco's High Atlas mountains The women were on a Christmas camping trip and were studying to become tour guides. The killers took four days to identify the women as targets, the prosecution said, and chose them because other potential victims were with guides, AFP said. Moroccan authorities were criticised by Ms Vesterager Jespersen's lawyer for failing to monitor the suspects' activities, which could have prevented the women being killed. The Jespersen family requested 10m dirhams ($1m; Â£800,000) compensation from the Moroccan government for its ""moral responsibility"" but this was rejected by the court, AFP reported, but the three men who were convicted were ordered to pay 2m dirhams in compensation.

My son was scarred for life by dangerous dog,"Ryan Booth's ear was torn off in the attack A mother has told how her six-year-old son's ear was torn off by two dogs that were kept off the leash. Claire Booth was out walking with son Ryan near their home in Bishopton, Renfrewshire, when she says two English bull terriers came ""from nowhere"" and ""dragged him around the ground"". Four years on, the mother says her family are still wary of open spaces. It comes as a Scottish Parliament committee claimed that dog control legislation is ""not fit for purpose"". Recalling the attack, Ms Booth told BBC Radio Scotland'sGood Morning Scotland: ""From a distance the owner of the two dogs were shouting 'don't worry they won't hurt you'. ""But as I managed to get Ryan up, his left ear had been bitten off - his earlobe had been detached from his head. There was blood everywhere, his whole face was distorted. ""He had a bite to his elbow, a bite to his hip and teeth marks embedded on his forehead. His whole face was bruised and battered, his whole body was bruised and battered. ""As a result of that Ryan has now got another three surgeries to face to rebuild his ear and he's now terrified of dogs. We are getting over that now but it has taken nearly four years for that to happen."" Ryan's ear has been left disfigured from the 2015 attack Although they did not witness the attack, Ryan's siblings are also scared of dogs having heard about the trauma he went through. Ms Booth said she was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder following the incident in 2015. The dogs' owner was prosecuted and received the maximum community service sentence. One dog was destroyed, but the other was given a control order which was never followed up. Ms Booth said: ""I felt it was farcical because the owner of the dog moved away to another area which means the dog control order was never followed up - the dog wardens didn't know where they were. ""The owner was supposed to take it to behavioural classes, have it on the lead at all times and be muzzled at all times - but nobody knows if that happened or not."" Ms Booth told a Holyrood committee that the attack on her son involved a bull terrier New laws were introduced in Scotland in 2010 but MSPs recently heard evidence there was still an ""unacceptably high prevalence of dog attacks"". Holyrood's post-legislative scrutiny committee said they considered it to be ""nothing less than a national crisis"". MSPs said the impact on victims, particularly on children, could be life-changing. The Control of Dogs Act 2010 was introduced to promote responsible dog ownership but the committee said it was not working. Its report called on the Scottish government to undertake a comprehensive review of all dog control laws immediately. Committee convener Jenny Marra said: ""There are still far too many dog attacks on children and little enforcement or understanding of the current laws that might prevent these attacks."" She called for urgent reform so that dangerous dogs can be dealt with properly. Some attack victims and their families want to see dogs kept on leads in public places The 2010 legislation brought in a new regime of ""dog control notices"" to impose measures on the people who do not keep their dog under control. It gave Scottish ministers the power to establish a national database of dog control notices so information could be shared across the country. The MSPs said the failure of ministers to use its powers was a ""missed opportunity"". They also said there were too few dog control wardens to enforce the current law and a lack of awareness of how it worked. The committee said that police, hospitals and local authorities were not keeping consistent data on dog attacks. Claire Booth told the committee about the attack while she and Ryan collected chestnuts Earlier this year, the Holyrood Committee heard thatthousands of people are treated each yearby hospital emergency departments for dog-related injuries. Ms Booth was among parents who told the committee about the horrific attacks endured when owners acted irresponsibly. The committee also heard from Radio Clyde journalist Natalie Crawford who initiated a campaign to keep dogs on leads in public places. She discovered that Glasgow City Council - Scotland's largest local authority - until recently had just one part-time dog warden and that there had been no dog control notices issued in a three-year period.

Red squirrel sighting is 'city's closest',"Gina Ganzenmueller managed to take a photo of the red squirrel in her garden A red squirrel spotted near an Aberdeen park is thought to be the first to have been seen so close to the city centre in decades. The sighting was in a garden north of Duthie Park, near the River Dee. The area has only known grey squirrels since the intruding population took over in the 1970s. Saving Scotland's Red Squirrels said it was one of the closest sightings to Aberdeen city centre in the project's 10-year history. Gina Ganzenmueller, who managed to take photos of the visitor to her garden, said: ""After years of grey squirrel sightings I've finally seen a red squirrel in my back garden. ""I was so excited, I couldn't believe my eyes. I only have a small garden, but Duthie Park is not far away."" Grey squirrels were first introduced to Aberdeen in the 1970s, rapidly spreading throughout the city and into surrounding Aberdeenshire. The region's native red squirrel populations declined rapidly through competition for food and living space. Years of control work carried out by Saving Scotland's Red Squirrels, a project led by Scottish Wildlife Trust, has already removed grey squirrels from much of Aberdeenshire. Red squirrels have begun to recolonise many areas, including the outskirts of Aberdeen. Dr Gwen Maggs, Saving Scotland's Red Squirrels Conservation Officer for North East Scotland, said: ""The project has been working along the River Dee for 10 years, with help from dedicated volunteers participating in our trap-loan scheme. ""As a result of this targeted grey squirrel control red squirrels have gradually returned to North Deeside, with populations establishing through Peterculter, Milltimber, Bieldside and Cults. In 2017 red squirrels arrived at Robert Gordon University. ""With healthy populations already in Hazlehead and Seaton Park, we hope that they will soon return to Duthie Park for everyone to enjoy.""

'Fuel-smuggling' tanker seized by Iran,"This video can not be played Iran took control of a Panama-registered tanker on 13 July Iran says it seized a ""foreign tanker"" and its 12 crew on Sunday for smuggling fuel in the Gulf. Iran's state media published footage of Iranian speedboats circling around the Panamanian-flagged Riah tanker. In a separate development, US President Donald Trump said the US Navy downed an Iranian drone in the Strait of Hormuz. He said the USS Boxer ""took defensive action"" after the drone had come within about 1,000 yards (914m) of the vessel. Gulf crisis: Are we heading for a new tanker war? Iran-US tensions: What's going on? Iran has so far made no public comments on the drone. Relations between the US and Iran are badly strained, with the US blaming Iran for attacks on oil tankers in the Gulf. Iran denies the allegations. The Revolutionary Guards' Sepah News site said on Thursday that the alleged fuel-smuggling ship was seized on Sunday during naval patrols aimed at ""discovering and confronting organised smuggling"". The ship had a two-million-litre capacity, but was carrying one million litres of fuel when it was seized south of Iran's Larak Island, the website said. Allow Twitter content?

The ship and crew were caught ""trying to hand over smuggled fuel which it had received from Iranian dhows to foreign ships further afield"", it went on. The case is now ""going through judicial procedures"". Why does the Strait of Hormuz matter? State media later published footage of Iranian speedboats circling around the Panamanian-flagged Riah tanker. Iran earlier in the week said it had come to the aid of a broken-down tanker, without naming the Riah. It made no mention of seizing the ship. The UK government said it was seeking further information over the reports and urged the Iranian authorities to ""de-escalate the situation in the region"". Tensions have been high in the Gulf since the US tightened the sanctions that it reimposed on Iran's oil sector after unilaterally withdrawing from a landmark 2015 nuclear deal. The US has blamed Iran for two separate attacks on oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman in May and June - an allegation Tehran has denied. Iran also shot down a US surveillance drone over the Strait of Hormuz in disputed circumstances. UK warships have meanwhile been shadowing British oil tankersin the area since Iran threatened to seize one in response to the impounding of an Iranian tanker off Gibraltar. The UK saidthe tanker was suspected of breaching EU sanctions against Syria. Iran denied it was en route there. US Central Command Chief General Kenneth McKenzie, speaking on a visit to Saudi Arabia on Thursday, said he was working ""aggressively"" to find a solution to free passage for ships through the Gulf region, Reuters news agency reports. The situation of missing or impounded tankers in the congested waters of the southern Gulf is far from clear. Commercial vessels navigating the Gulf, the Strait of Hormuz and the high seas are all normally equipped with a transponder known as AIS (Automatic Identification System). This transmits their location on two dedicated VHF (Very High Frequency) channels. When it is switched off, the ship's signal disappears from the satellite map, making it difficult, as in this case, to work out where a ship has gone to and what it is up to. What is beyond doubt is that illegal smuggling has been going on for decades in the Gulf, including by oil tanker captains hugging the Iranian coastline to stay out of international waters, allegedly bribing local coastguards along the way. For years a fleet of fast Iranian speedboats has plied the short distance between the Omani port of Khasab and Iranian ports close to Bandar Abbas, evading coastguard patrols and smuggling cigarettes and other lucrative contraband. May 2018:US President Donald Trump withdraws from the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and six world powers, and later imposes punishing sanctions against Iran 2 May 2019:Mr Trump steps up pressure on Tehran by ending exemptions from secondary sanctions for countries still buying Iranian oil 5 May:The US sends an aircraft carrier strike group and B-52 bombers to the Gulf because of ""troubling and escalatory indications"" related to Iran 8 May:Iranian President Hassan Rouhani says Iran will scale back its commitments under the nuclear deal in retaliation for the US sanctions 12 May:Four oil tankers are damaged by explosions off the UAE coast in the Gulf of Oman. The UAE says the blasts were caused by limpet mines planted by a ""state actor"". The US blames Iran, but Tehran denies the allegation 13 June:Explosions hit two oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman. The US again accuses Iran, releasing footage purportedly showing Iranian forces removing an unexploded limpet mine from a damaged vessel. Iran says the evidence is fabricated 20 June:Iranian forces shoot down a US military drone over the Strait of Hormuz 1 July:Iran breaches a limit on its stockpile of low-enriched uranium set under the nuclear deal. Enriched uranium is used to make reactor fuel, and potentially nuclear weapons 4 July:Gibraltar, assisted by British Royal Marines, seizes Iranian oil tanker Grace 1 on suspicion of breaking EU sanctions on trade with Syria. Iran says the tanker was not going to Syria 7 July:Iran breaches another commitment under the nuclear deal by resuming enriching uranium to higher levels. It vows to reverse the step if European countries do more to mitigate the effects of the US sanctions 10 July:UK says Iranian naval vessels tried to impede a British tanker as it moved into the Strait of Hormuz, before being forced to back off by a Royal Navy frigate.

He fell from a platform he was helping to install at the Khalifa stadium, after lever hoists failed. At the inquest, coroner Veronica Hamilton-Deeley blamed substandard equipment and chaotic working conditions. The Qatari committee responsible for the 2022 World Cup has now agreed to hold an independent investigation. Former High Court judge Sir Robert Akenhead will look into the decisions that led to Mr Cox's death. Qatar's World Cup committee said the health and safety of its workers remained its utmost priority. Qatar's World Cup committee said the health and safety of its workers remained its utmost priority Mr Cox's sisters-in-law Ella Joseph and Hazel Mayes said the period since his death had been ""extremely difficult"" for his family and friends. In a statement on behalf of the family, they said: ""Following the UK Coroner's inquest into Zac's death... our family called for an independent investigation into the circumstances surrounding his death. ""We wanted to get to the truth about the decisions and circumstances that led to his death and to try and ensure that lessons are learnt that could help prevent other similar incidents from occurring in the future."" They added: ""We welcome Sir Robert Akenhead's appointment and the commencement of the investigation. ""We also welcome the Supreme Committee's commitment to ensure everyone concerned co-operates fully with this independent investigation. ""Both the Supreme Committee and Zac's family share the view that Sir Robert Akenhead must be able to conduct his activity unhindered and with absolute autonomy.""

No-deal Brexit 'could cause Â£30bn economic hit',"Public borrowing could double next year if there is a no-deal Brexit, the country's spending watchdog says. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) said borrowing would be almost Â£60bn if the UK leaves without a deal - up from Â£29.3bn if it does get a deal. The watchdog said this scenario was based on assumptions that a no-deal Brexit would cause a UK recession. The UK is set to leave the European Union on 31 October. Chances of a no-deal outcome appear to have risen recently, after both Tory leadership contenders said they would be willing to leave the EU without a deal. UK 'will have to face consequences of no deal' No-deal Brexit: What you need to know Faisal Islam: Dilemma for new prime minister The OBR was created in 2010 to give independent analysis of the UK's public finances. In its first assessment,externalof the economic impact of a no-deal scenario, the OBR used IMF analysis that shows the UK economy would contract by 2% in 2020 before recovering in 2021. This would come as tariffs of 4% were imposed on goods traded with the EU - up from zero currently - although the IMF does not expect there to be disruption at the border. In this scenario, the OBR said that ""heightened uncertainty and declining confidence"" would deter investment, while higher trade barriers with the EU would ""weigh on exports"". ""Together, these push the economy into recession, with asset prices and the pound falling sharply,"" it said. It said this could raise inflation and squeeze real incomes. It would also hit tax receipts, causing public sector borrowing to rise and leaving debt 12% higher by 2024. The OBR added this was ""not necessarily the most likely outcome"" but also ""by no means the worst case scenario"". It also warned that both Conservative leadership contenders had made ""a series of uncosted proposals for tax cuts and spending increases that would be likely to increase government borrowing by tens of billions of pounds if implemented"". The government's official independent budgetary watchdog has for the first time put a price on the impact to the public finances of leaving the European Union without a deal. The numbers come at a sensitive time politically when both likely future prime ministers suggest that a no-deal Brexit is possible this year. The OBR is legally obliged to consider all threats to the public finances, and today's new numbers come as part of its bi-annual Fiscal Risks report. The fall in tax revenue is forecast to significantly outweigh any benefit from no longer paying the UK's subscription fee as a member of the EU. The numbers show a deep crisis-like impact on the public finances, and are based on the IMF's projections for the economy. But they go further, showing a long-run hit to the economy. Read more from Faisal This video can not be played Philip Hammond: No-deal would cause 'significant hit' to UK economy The forecast used by the OBR is less severe than those of the Bank of England and the Treasury. In November, the Bank said a no-deal outcome could send the pound plunging and trigger a worse recession than the 2008 financial crisis. The economy could shrink by 8% in the immediate aftermath if there was no transition period, the Bank said. The Treasury meanwhile has predicted a Â£90bn hit to the economy by 2035 - although prominent eurosceptics dispute this view. In a comment piece for the Telegraph newspaper earlier this week, Conservative backbencher Jacob Rees-Mogg called the forecast ""silliness"", adding that a no-deal scenario could instead boost the economy by Â£80bn. On Thursday, Mr Hammond said: ""The report that the OBR has published shows that even in the most benign version of a no-deal exit, there would be a very significant hit to the UK economy. ""But that most benign version is not the version that is being talked about by prominent Brexiteers. They are talking about a much harder version that would cause much more disruption."" Both Jeremy Hunt and Boris Johnson say they are prepared to leave the EU without a deal John McDonnell, Labour's shadow chancellor, said: ""We know that a no-deal Brexit would devastate the UK economy and the public finances, and it comes on top of the failed economic approach for the last nine years. ""This warning makes it even more imperative MPs from across Parliament back today's amendments to try and block the next prime minister from shutting down Parliament to force through a no-deal Brexit."" Chuka Umunna, the Liberal Democrat business and treasury spokesman, said: ""It would be unforgiveable to heap further stress and anxiety on families who are already struggling by deliberately pursuing a policy that the government's own independent economic watchdog now says will result in a recession."" The chances of a no-deal appear to have risen in recent weeks after both candidates in the race to replace Theresa May hardened their positions on the controversial Irish backstop - an insurance policy to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland after Brexit. Jeremy Hunt and Boris Johnson both said the backstop was ""dead"", but the EU said it would not support any deal that excludes it. In an interview with the BBC's Panorama programme - conducted in May before the start of the Conservative leadership contest - the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, said the UK would have to ""face the consequences"" if it opted to leave without a deal.

Trump - I disagree with Omar rally chant,"This video can not be played Trump on ""Send her back"": ""I disagree with the chant"" President Donald Trump has disavowed the ""send her back"" chants directed at Democratic congresswoman Ilhan Omar by his supporters at a campaign rally. Ms Omar is a US citizen who emigrated from Somalia with her family after fleeing the country's civil war. The chants, which came after Mr Trump criticised Ms Omar and three other congresswomen, were widely condemned, including by some Republicans. ""I was not happy with it. I disagree with it,"" Mr Trump said of the chant. He did not elaborate on what he disagreed with. ""It was quite a chant and I felt a little bit badly about it,"" Mr Trump told reporters on Thursday. ""I started speaking very quickly but it started up rather fast, as you probably noticed."" The controversial chants took place at Mr Trump's campaign rally in North Carolina. Mr Trump was cheered on by the crowd of thousands as he again accused Ms Omar and her fellow congresswomen Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rashia Tlaib, Ayanna Pressley - known as ""the squad"" - of hating America. Ahead of the rally, a bid to impeach Mr Trump was blocked in Congress. Critics say it echoed the ""lock her up"" phrase adopted by his supporters against Hillary Clinton in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election. Do Trump rally taunts mark new strategy? Who are the congresswomen known as the squad? The chant comes as tensions escalate between the president and the four Democratic congresswomen over recent tweets, in which Mr Trump told the then four politicians to ""go back"" to their countries. This video can not be played ""Send her back"" chants at Trump rally Ms Omar told reporters on Thursday:  ""Every single person who is in this country, who's aspiring to become part of the American fabric understands that nothing this president says should be taken to heart."" ""As he's spewing his fascist ideology on stage, telling US citizens to go back because they don't agree with his detrimental policies for our country, we tell people that here in the US dissent is patriotic, here in the US disagreement is welcome."" On Wednesday, Ms Omar tweeted lines from Maya Angelou's poem Still I Rise and later shared a photo of herself in the House of Representatives saying, ""I am where I belong"". Allow Twitter content?

Some conservatives have also censured the use of the phrase. Chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee Tom Emmer - who, like Ms Omar, represents Minnesota in Congress - told reporters he did not agree with the language. This video can not be played Democratic congresswoman Rashida Tlaib: ""I'm dealing with the biggest bully I've ever had to deal with"" ""There's no place for that kind of talk,"" Mr Emmer said,according to Politico,external. He said the chant was ""not acceptable"". North Carolina congressman Mark Walker said that he ""struggled"" with the chant and that the focus should be on ""her history, words & actions"" instead of ""phrasing that's painful to our friends in the minority communities"". His fellow Republican Adam Kinzinger said the chants were ""ugly"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Conservative commentator Ben Shapiro said ""chanting for her deportation based on her exercise of the First Amendment is disgusting"". Senator Lindsay Graham, a vocal Trump supporter, defended the president, though he said he wished Mr Trump would focus on ""policies not the personality"". ""I've said before that if you're a Somali refugee wearing a Maga hat, he doesn't want to send you back. You'd probably have dinner at the White House,"" Mr Graham told reporters. Republican leader Mitch McConnell told the Fox Business Network on Thursday that Mr Trump is ""on to something"" by attacking the four congresswomen as their policies will be important in the upcoming election. ""We're in a big debate now and next year about what we want America to be like. Do we really think socialism applies here at a time of great prosperity, 50-year-low unemployment?"" Three years ago, crowds at Donald Trump rallies called for the imprisonment of a political adversary. On Wednesday, they chanted for a member of the opposition party to be expelled from the country. These are not behaviours emblematic of a healthy, well-functioning democracy. The president's defenders have parsed his incendiary language in an effort to explain why telling people to ""go back"" to the ""totally broken and crime infested places from which they came"" is not simply the latest iteration of age-old racist invective. It was, they insist, just a Trumpian twist on ""love it or leave it"" sloganeering. When the rhetoric filters down to the president's vocal crowds, however, such nuance is lost. Mr Trump is an instinctual politician who senses weakness and opportunity and often acts before a strategy is fully formed. The goal, however, is clear. He is both trying to sow divisions within Democratic ranks and rile up a base whose enthusiastic turnout will be needed in the coming election. Such a course is not without risk, however. His actions could motivate and unify opponents as much as they do his base. It's a recipe for a toxic, divisive campaign that will get ugly - and fast. In an interview withthe Daily Mail,externaljust before the Greenville rally, Mr Trump said he was ""not unhappy"" with the way the row has played out and said he believes he is ""winning the political fight...by a lot"". ""I'm not relishing the fight,"" Mr Trump said. ""I'm enjoying it because I have to get the word out to the American people. And you have to enjoy what you do. I enjoy what I do."" In a series of tweets on Sunday, the president said  the four congresswomen - who he did not identify - ""originally came from countries whose governments are a complete and total catastrophe"" and should ""go back"". The president has denied accusations that the tweets were racist, but the Democrat-controlledHouse passed a symbolic resolutiondenouncing Mr Trump's ""racist comments that have legitimised fear and hatred of New Americans and people of colour"". A July pollby the Pew Research Center,externalfound that while 62% of overall Americans believe openness to people from around the world is ""essential to who we are as a nation"", 57% of Republicans said the US risks ""losing our identity as a nation"" if it is too open. Earlier on Wednesday, a bid to launch impeachment proceedings against Mr Trump was blocked in the US House of Representatives after it failed to win enough support, with only 95 Democrats voting in favour.

"Death penalty for Morocco tourist murderersThey killed two women from Denmark and Norway, found beheaded in the Atlas mountains in December.Africa","Rachid Afatti (L) videoed Younes Ouaziyad (C) and Abdessamad Ejjoud (R) as they carried out the killings Three Islamic State group supporters who murdered two Scandinavian hikers in Morocco have been sentenced to death. The verdicts for ringleader Abdessamad Ejjoud, Younes Ouaziyad and Rachid Afatti follow petitions on social media calling for their execution. Louisa Vesterager Jespersen, 24, from Denmark, and Maren Ueland, 28, from Norway, were found beheaded in the High Atlas mountains in December. If the executions go ahead, they will be the first in Morocco since 1993. That year saw the country introduce a moratorium on capital punishment. During the trial, it emerged that Ejjoud, 25, and Ouaziyad, 27, had beheaded the two women while Afatti, 33, filmed the murders on his mobile phone. Maren Ueland, left, and Louisa Vesterager Jespersen were studying to be tour guides ""The most just thing would be to give these beasts the death penalty they deserve,"" Helle Petersen, Ms Jespersen's mother, said in a letter that was read out in court last week. The verdict follows an 11-week trial in SalÃ© near the capital Rabat. Ejjoud, an underground imam, admitted killing one of the two women in May. ""I beheaded one of them... I regret it,"" the street vendor told the court. French media report that Ejjoud had served a prison sentence in Morocco for trying to join the Islamic State (IS) group in Syria, and was released in 2015. Afatti filmed the attack on his mobile phone. A video appearing to show one of the women being beheaded was shared online by IS supporters. Police in Norway saidthe video was almost certainly real. The suspects arrived in court under heavy guard The three men all said they were IS supporters, although IS has not said it was behind the killings. In court, Ejjoud said: ""We loved Islamic State and prayed to God for it."" Their defence team said there were ""mitigating circumstances on account of their precarious social conditions and psychological disequilibrium"", AFP reported. They said the men had a ""very low"" level of education and came from modest backgrounds. Kevin Zoller Guervos, a Spanish-Swiss convert to Islam, was the only non-Moroccan on trial. He was accused of teaching the main suspects how to use an encrypted messaging service and to use weapons. He was sentenced to 20 years in prison for ""joining a terrorist group"", AFP reported.

Morocco's anti-terror chief, quoted by the AFP news agency, said the group was inspired by IS - but had no contact with IS militants in combat zones. The prosecution labelled the three killers as ""bloodthirsty monsters"" after the autopsy report found 23 injuries on Ms Jespersen's decapitated body and seven on that of Ms Ueland. Ms Jespersen and Ms Ueland were flatmates at Norway's Bo University. Their bodies were found on 17 December in a tent in an isolated area near Mount Toubkal, Morocco's highest peak and a popular destination for hikers. Both had taken full precautions ahead of their trip, Ms Ueland's mother said last year. The victims' bodies were found in an isolated area in Morocco's High Atlas mountains The women were on a Christmas camping trip and were studying to become tour guides. The killers took four days to identify the women as targets, the prosecution said, and chose them because other potential victims were with guides, AFP said. Moroccan authorities were criticised by Ms Vesterager Jespersen's lawyer for failing to monitor the suspects' activities, which could have prevented the women being killed. The Jespersen family requested 10m dirhams ($1m; Â£800,000) compensation from the Moroccan government for its ""moral responsibility"" but this was rejected by the court, AFP reported, but the three men who were convicted were ordered to pay 2m dirhams in compensation.

No-deal Brexit 'could cause Â£30bn economic hit'The Office for Budget Responsibility says borrowing could surge if the UK leaves the EU without a deal.,"Public borrowing could double next year if there is a no-deal Brexit, the country's spending watchdog says. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) said borrowing would be almost Â£60bn if the UK leaves without a deal - up from Â£29.3bn if it does get a deal. The watchdog said this scenario was based on assumptions that a no-deal Brexit would cause a UK recession. The UK is set to leave the European Union on 31 October. Chances of a no-deal outcome appear to have risen recently, after both Tory leadership contenders said they would be willing to leave the EU without a deal. UK 'will have to face consequences of no deal' No-deal Brexit: What you need to know Faisal Islam: Dilemma for new prime minister The OBR was created in 2010 to give independent analysis of the UK's public finances. In its first assessment,externalof the economic impact of a no-deal scenario, the OBR used IMF analysis that shows the UK economy would contract by 2% in 2020 before recovering in 2021. This would come as tariffs of 4% were imposed on goods traded with the EU - up from zero currently - although the IMF does not expect there to be disruption at the border. In this scenario, the OBR said that ""heightened uncertainty and declining confidence"" would deter investment, while higher trade barriers with the EU would ""weigh on exports"". ""Together, these push the economy into recession, with asset prices and the pound falling sharply,"" it said. It said this could raise inflation and squeeze real incomes. It would also hit tax receipts, causing public sector borrowing to rise and leaving debt 12% higher by 2024. The OBR added this was ""not necessarily the most likely outcome"" but also ""by no means the worst case scenario"". It also warned that both Conservative leadership contenders had made ""a series of uncosted proposals for tax cuts and spending increases that would be likely to increase government borrowing by tens of billions of pounds if implemented"". The government's official independent budgetary watchdog has for the first time put a price on the impact to the public finances of leaving the European Union without a deal. The numbers come at a sensitive time politically when both likely future prime ministers suggest that a no-deal Brexit is possible this year. The OBR is legally obliged to consider all threats to the public finances, and today's new numbers come as part of its bi-annual Fiscal Risks report. The fall in tax revenue is forecast to significantly outweigh any benefit from no longer paying the UK's subscription fee as a member of the EU. The numbers show a deep crisis-like impact on the public finances, and are based on the IMF's projections for the economy. But they go further, showing a long-run hit to the economy. Read more from Faisal This video can not be played Philip Hammond: No-deal would cause 'significant hit' to UK economy The forecast used by the OBR is less severe than those of the Bank of England and the Treasury. In November, the Bank said a no-deal outcome could send the pound plunging and trigger a worse recession than the 2008 financial crisis. The economy could shrink by 8% in the immediate aftermath if there was no transition period, the Bank said. The Treasury meanwhile has predicted a Â£90bn hit to the economy by 2035 - although prominent eurosceptics dispute this view. In a comment piece for the Telegraph newspaper earlier this week, Conservative backbencher Jacob Rees-Mogg called the forecast ""silliness"", adding that a no-deal scenario could instead boost the economy by Â£80bn. On Thursday, Mr Hammond said: ""The report that the OBR has published shows that even in the most benign version of a no-deal exit, there would be a very significant hit to the UK economy. ""But that most benign version is not the version that is being talked about by prominent Brexiteers. They are talking about a much harder version that would cause much more disruption."" Both Jeremy Hunt and Boris Johnson say they are prepared to leave the EU without a deal John McDonnell, Labour's shadow chancellor, said: ""We know that a no-deal Brexit would devastate the UK economy and the public finances, and it comes on top of the failed economic approach for the last nine years.

Arson attack at Japan anime studio kills 33,"This video can not be played Kyoto Animation offices on fire At least 33 people died and dozens were injured after a man set fire to an animation studio in the Japanese city of Kyoto, officials say. Police said the 41-year-old suspect broke into the Kyoto Animation studio on Thursday morning and sprayed petrol before igniting it. The suspect has been detained and was taken to hospital with injuries. Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said the incident was ""too appalling for words"" and offered condolences. It is one of Japan's worst mass casualty incidents since World War Two. Kyoto Animation, known as KyoAni, produces films and graphic novels, and is well regarded by fans for the quality of its productions. The fire broke out at the three-storey building at about 10:30 local time (01:35 GMT) on Thursday. Rescue operations are still ongoing. KyoAni: The beloved studio making distinctive art Police also found knives at the scene, say local media. Public broadcaster NHK said the man had been heard saying ""drop dead"" as he set fire to the building. The suspect's relationship with the company is unclear. It took firefighters five hours to bring the blaze under control, reports said Eyewitnesses described a loud explosion followed by an inferno that rapidly engulfed the building. ""I saw some people with burns, covered with something. They were rushed to the ambulance,"" one neighbour said. Volunteer fire corps members stand guard in front of the Kyoto Animation building The official, Kazuhiro Hayashi, said most of the casualties had been on the stairs to the top floor, where they apparently collapsed trying to escape. Firefighters said they had found 33 bodies, two on the first floor, 11 on the second floor and 20 on the stairs from the third floor to the top floor, he said. Some 36 people are in hospital, some in a critical condition, reports say. About 70 people were in the building when the fire started. Reports say the man is not a former employee - but eyewitnesses say he appeared to be angry with the animation studio. They said he ran away from the building towards a nearby train station after the fire started but fell to the ground. Some reports said he was pursued by employees of Kyoto Animation. Emergency crew wheel a stretcher away from the building in the city of Kyoto ""A person with singed hair was lying down and there were bloody footprints,"" a 59-year-old woman living nearby told news agency Kyodo. ""He seemed to be in pain, irritated and suffering, but also angry as if he was resentful. I heard him saying something like 'You copied it',"" a neighbour said. The Asahi Shimbun newspaper quoted a 61-year-old neighbour as sayingshe clearly heard the man shout,external: ""You ripped me off."" The suspect was injured and was being treated in hospital, so police could not immediately question him, NHK said. Japanese media reports said a man in his 40s had earlier bought 40 litres (nine gallons) of petrol at a nearby petrol station. Two containers used for the fuel were later found at the scene of the fire, Asahi Shimbun newspaper reported. Meanwhile Kyoto Animation Director Hideaki Hatta told the broadcaster that the company had recently received threatening emails. ""They were addressed to our office and sales department and told us to die,"" he said. Mr Hatta told reporters that he was ""heartbroken"" at the attack. ""It is unbearable that the people who helped carry Japan's animation industry were hurt and lost their lives in this way,"" he said. Kyoto Animation, known as KyoAni, was founded in 1981 and has produced popular animation shows including K-On and The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya. The studio also released a standalone feature anime A Silent Voice in 2016. One of KyoAni's series, Violet Evergarden, was picked up by Netflix for a global market. Floral tributes have been left outside the building as people pay their respects to the victims It also publishes many popular graphic novels, mainly about teenage school life. The studio is known for paying its animators a regular salary, breaking with the industry's standard of paying per frame - which is seen as putting extreme pressure on staff. It is also the first successful studio outside Tokyo, Prof Ryusuke Hikawa from Meiji University told NHK. Japanese anime has a huge following not just in Japan but around the world. On social media, many fans have been expressing their shock and posting pictures of their favourite KyoAni shows. A GoFundMe campaign titled ""Help KyoAni Heal"" has also been started, with more than $300,000 (Â£240,000) raised in six hours. Voiceover artist SungWon Cho - who works on anime films - was among those to react. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Iran seizes 'fuel-smuggling' tanker in Gulf,"This video can not be played Iran took control of a Panama-registered tanker on 13 July Iran says it seized a ""foreign tanker"" and its 12 crew on Sunday for smuggling fuel in the Gulf. Iran's state media published footage of Iranian speedboats circling around the Panamanian-flagged Riah tanker. In a separate development, US President Donald Trump said the US Navy downed an Iranian drone in the Strait of Hormuz. He said the USS Boxer ""took defensive action"" after the drone had come within about 1,000 yards (914m) of the vessel. Gulf crisis: Are we heading for a new tanker war? Iran-US tensions: What's going on? Iran has so far made no public comments on the drone. Relations between the US and Iran are badly strained, with the US blaming Iran for attacks on oil tankers in the Gulf. Iran denies the allegations. The Revolutionary Guards' Sepah News site said on Thursday that the alleged fuel-smuggling ship was seized on Sunday during naval patrols aimed at ""discovering and confronting organised smuggling"". The ship had a two-million-litre capacity, but was carrying one million litres of fuel when it was seized south of Iran's Larak Island, the website said. Allow Twitter content?

The ship and crew were caught ""trying to hand over smuggled fuel which it had received from Iranian dhows to foreign ships further afield"", it went on. The case is now ""going through judicial procedures"". Why does the Strait of Hormuz matter? State media later published footage of Iranian speedboats circling around the Panamanian-flagged Riah tanker. Iran earlier in the week said it had come to the aid of a broken-down tanker, without naming the Riah. It made no mention of seizing the ship. The UK government said it was seeking further information over the reports and urged the Iranian authorities to ""de-escalate the situation in the region"". Tensions have been high in the Gulf since the US tightened the sanctions that it reimposed on Iran's oil sector after unilaterally withdrawing from a landmark 2015 nuclear deal. The US has blamed Iran for two separate attacks on oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman in May and June - an allegation Tehran has denied. Iran also shot down a US surveillance drone over the Strait of Hormuz in disputed circumstances. UK warships have meanwhile been shadowing British oil tankersin the area since Iran threatened to seize one in response to the impounding of an Iranian tanker off Gibraltar. The UK saidthe tanker was suspected of breaching EU sanctions against Syria. Iran denied it was en route there. US Central Command Chief General Kenneth McKenzie, speaking on a visit to Saudi Arabia on Thursday, said he was working ""aggressively"" to find a solution to free passage for ships through the Gulf region, Reuters news agency reports. The situation of missing or impounded tankers in the congested waters of the southern Gulf is far from clear. Commercial vessels navigating the Gulf, the Strait of Hormuz and the high seas are all normally equipped with a transponder known as AIS (Automatic Identification System). This transmits their location on two dedicated VHF (Very High Frequency) channels. When it is switched off, the ship's signal disappears from the satellite map, making it difficult, as in this case, to work out where a ship has gone to and what it is up to. What is beyond doubt is that illegal smuggling has been going on for decades in the Gulf, including by oil tanker captains hugging the Iranian coastline to stay out of international waters, allegedly bribing local coastguards along the way. For years a fleet of fast Iranian speedboats has plied the short distance between the Omani port of Khasab and Iranian ports close to Bandar Abbas, evading coastguard patrols and smuggling cigarettes and other lucrative contraband.

No-deal Brexit 'could cause Â£30bn economic hit'The Office for Budget Responsibility says borrowing could surge if the UK leaves the EU without a deal.BusinessComments,"Public borrowing could double next year if there is a no-deal Brexit, the country's spending watchdog says. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) said borrowing would be almost Â£60bn if the UK leaves without a deal - up from Â£29.3bn if it does get a deal. The watchdog said this scenario was based on assumptions that a no-deal Brexit would cause a UK recession. The UK is set to leave the European Union on 31 October. Chances of a no-deal outcome appear to have risen recently, after both Tory leadership contenders said they would be willing to leave the EU without a deal. UK 'will have to face consequences of no deal' No-deal Brexit: What you need to know Faisal Islam: Dilemma for new prime minister The OBR was created in 2010 to give independent analysis of the UK's public finances. In its first assessment,externalof the economic impact of a no-deal scenario, the OBR used IMF analysis that shows the UK economy would contract by 2% in 2020 before recovering in 2021. This would come as tariffs of 4% were imposed on goods traded with the EU - up from zero currently - although the IMF does not expect there to be disruption at the border. In this scenario, the OBR said that ""heightened uncertainty and declining confidence"" would deter investment, while higher trade barriers with the EU would ""weigh on exports"". ""Together, these push the economy into recession, with asset prices and the pound falling sharply,"" it said. It said this could raise inflation and squeeze real incomes. It would also hit tax receipts, causing public sector borrowing to rise and leaving debt 12% higher by 2024. The OBR added this was ""not necessarily the most likely outcome"" but also ""by no means the worst case scenario"". It also warned that both Conservative leadership contenders had made ""a series of uncosted proposals for tax cuts and spending increases that would be likely to increase government borrowing by tens of billions of pounds if implemented"". The government's official independent budgetary watchdog has for the first time put a price on the impact to the public finances of leaving the European Union without a deal. The numbers come at a sensitive time politically when both likely future prime ministers suggest that a no-deal Brexit is possible this year. The OBR is legally obliged to consider all threats to the public finances, and today's new numbers come as part of its bi-annual Fiscal Risks report. The fall in tax revenue is forecast to significantly outweigh any benefit from no longer paying the UK's subscription fee as a member of the EU. The numbers show a deep crisis-like impact on the public finances, and are based on the IMF's projections for the economy. But they go further, showing a long-run hit to the economy. Read more from Faisal This video can not be played Philip Hammond: No-deal would cause 'significant hit' to UK economy The forecast used by the OBR is less severe than those of the Bank of England and the Treasury. In November, the Bank said a no-deal outcome could send the pound plunging and trigger a worse recession than the 2008 financial crisis. The economy could shrink by 8% in the immediate aftermath if there was no transition period, the Bank said. The Treasury meanwhile has predicted a Â£90bn hit to the economy by 2035 - although prominent eurosceptics dispute this view. In a comment piece for the Telegraph newspaper earlier this week, Conservative backbencher Jacob Rees-Mogg called the forecast ""silliness"", adding that a no-deal scenario could instead boost the economy by Â£80bn. On Thursday, Mr Hammond said: ""The report that the OBR has published shows that even in the most benign version of a no-deal exit, there would be a very significant hit to the UK economy. ""But that most benign version is not the version that is being talked about by prominent Brexiteers. They are talking about a much harder version that would cause much more disruption."" Both Jeremy Hunt and Boris Johnson say they are prepared to leave the EU without a deal John McDonnell, Labour's shadow chancellor, said: ""We know that a no-deal Brexit would devastate the UK economy and the public finances, and it comes on top of the failed economic approach for the last nine years. ""This warning makes it even more imperative MPs from across Parliament back today's amendments to try and block the next prime minister from shutting down Parliament to force through a no-deal Brexit."" Chuka Umunna, the Liberal Democrat business and treasury spokesman, said: ""It would be unforgiveable to heap further stress and anxiety on families who are already struggling by deliberately pursuing a policy that the government's own independent economic watchdog now says will result in a recession."" The chances of a no-deal appear to have risen in recent weeks after both candidates in the race to replace Theresa May hardened their positions on the controversial Irish backstop - an insurance policy to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland after Brexit. Jeremy Hunt and Boris Johnson both said the backstop was ""dead"", but the EU said it would not support any deal that excludes it. In an interview with the BBC's Panorama programme - conducted in May before the start of the Conservative leadership contest - the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, said the UK would have to ""face the consequences"" if it opted to leave without a deal. Mr Barnier said the thrice-rejected withdrawal agreement negotiated by Theresa May was the ""only way to leave the EU in an orderly manner"". No-deal Brexit: Who will the new PM believe?

Arson attack at Japan anime studio kills 26,"This video can not be played Kyoto Animation offices on fire At least 33 people died and dozens were injured after a man set fire to an animation studio in the Japanese city of Kyoto, officials say. Police said the 41-year-old suspect broke into the Kyoto Animation studio on Thursday morning and sprayed petrol before igniting it. The suspect has been detained and was taken to hospital with injuries. Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said the incident was ""too appalling for words"" and offered condolences. It is one of Japan's worst mass casualty incidents since World War Two. Kyoto Animation, known as KyoAni, produces films and graphic novels, and is well regarded by fans for the quality of its productions. The fire broke out at the three-storey building at about 10:30 local time (01:35 GMT) on Thursday. Rescue operations are still ongoing. KyoAni: The beloved studio making distinctive art Police also found knives at the scene, say local media. Public broadcaster NHK said the man had been heard saying ""drop dead"" as he set fire to the building. The suspect's relationship with the company is unclear. It took firefighters five hours to bring the blaze under control, reports said Eyewitnesses described a loud explosion followed by an inferno that rapidly engulfed the building. ""I saw some people with burns, covered with something. They were rushed to the ambulance,"" one neighbour said. Volunteer fire corps members stand guard in front of the Kyoto Animation building The official, Kazuhiro Hayashi, said most of the casualties had been on the stairs to the top floor, where they apparently collapsed trying to escape. Firefighters said they had found 33 bodies, two on the first floor, 11 on the second floor and 20 on the stairs from the third floor to the top floor, he said. Some 36 people are in hospital, some in a critical condition, reports say. About 70 people were in the building when the fire started. Reports say the man is not a former employee - but eyewitnesses say he appeared to be angry with the animation studio. They said he ran away from the building towards a nearby train station after the fire started but fell to the ground. Some reports said he was pursued by employees of Kyoto Animation. Emergency crew wheel a stretcher away from the building in the city of Kyoto ""A person with singed hair was lying down and there were bloody footprints,"" a 59-year-old woman living nearby told news agency Kyodo. ""He seemed to be in pain, irritated and suffering, but also angry as if he was resentful. I heard him saying something like 'You copied it',"" a neighbour said. The Asahi Shimbun newspaper quoted a 61-year-old neighbour as sayingshe clearly heard the man shout,external: ""You ripped me off."" The suspect was injured and was being treated in hospital, so police could not immediately question him, NHK said. Japanese media reports said a man in his 40s had earlier bought 40 litres (nine gallons) of petrol at a nearby petrol station. Two containers used for the fuel were later found at the scene of the fire, Asahi Shimbun newspaper reported. Meanwhile Kyoto Animation Director Hideaki Hatta told the broadcaster that the company had recently received threatening emails. ""They were addressed to our office and sales department and told us to die,"" he said. Mr Hatta told reporters that he was ""heartbroken"" at the attack. ""It is unbearable that the people who helped carry Japan's animation industry were hurt and lost their lives in this way,"" he said. Kyoto Animation, known as KyoAni, was founded in 1981 and has produced popular animation shows including K-On and The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya. The studio also released a standalone feature anime A Silent Voice in 2016. One of KyoAni's series, Violet Evergarden, was picked up by Netflix for a global market. Floral tributes have been left outside the building as people pay their respects to the victims It also publishes many popular graphic novels, mainly about teenage school life. The studio is known for paying its animators a regular salary, breaking with the industry's standard of paying per frame - which is seen as putting extreme pressure on staff. It is also the first successful studio outside Tokyo, Prof Ryusuke Hikawa from Meiji University told NHK. Japanese anime has a huge following not just in Japan but around the world. On social media, many fans have been expressing their shock and posting pictures of their favourite KyoAni shows. A GoFundMe campaign titled ""Help KyoAni Heal"" has also been started, with more than $300,000 (Â£240,000) raised in six hours. Voiceover artist SungWon Cho - who works on anime films - was among those to react. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

10 things that stopped Brexit happening,"Prime Minister Theresa May has been forced to quit. Parliament is deadlocked. Both the Conservative and Labour parties are deeply divided and deeply unpopular. What's more, with days to go before there is a new occupant of No 10, no-one has identified a clear route to an agreement that will avoid an outcome pretty much everyone says they want to avoid - a costly and disruptive no-deal Brexit. So, how did the UK end up here? For the past few months, the BBC's Panorama team has spoken to those with first-hand knowledge of the negotiations - in Brussels, Paris and Dublin as well as Westminster. We've interviewed at length, on and off the record, the men and women who tried and failed to make a Brexit deal that both the UK and the EU could agree to. This is an account of 10 crucial mistakes, mishaps and misunderstandings that might explain why we haven't left yet. George Bridges was a new minister in the Brexit department created from scratch in 2016 when Theresa May became prime minister - a job she only got because the UK voted to leave the EU. At least Bridges had an office. Secretary of State David Davis's political advisers had to share a cupboard, while the department's top official had to change his office three times in one day. It was chaos. Lord Bridges, who was a junior minister, assumed that the thinking about Brexit must be taking place somewhere else: ""I was very much under the view that there would be somewhere in No 10 a very small, very secret group, putting together an almighty chart, a big plan of how we were going to negotiate and crucially what our overall objectives were. So, the prime minister - rather like a Bond villain - would be sitting with her white cat on her lap with this big plan behind her. I'd love to say that that room existed. I never found it."" He wasn't the only one. In Brussels, top EU officials were waiting to see what the UK would propose. ""We thought they are so brilliant there will be, in some vault somewhere in Westminster, a Harry Potter type book with all the tricks and all the things in it to do."" Frans Timmermans, first vice president of the European Commission, was shocked by what he saw and heard. Or rather what he didn't: ""I thought, 'Oh my God, they haven't got a planâ¦they haven't got a planâ¦ it's like Lance Corporal Jones'. It was, 'Don't panic, don't panic,' running around like idiots."" David Cameron, 2015 The truth is there was no plan for Brexit when the UK voted to leave. David Cameron had no Plan B when he called the EU referendum. One senior official says he stopped civil servants preparing one as he was fearful it might leak. The main Leave campaign, led by Boris Johnson and Michael Gove, had decided not to produce a Plan A. They knew the choices that would have to be made would split their coalition of support. Theresa May came to office without a plan. Indeed, she barely mentioned Brexit in her speech in Downing Street. Speaking to the BBC, former French President Francois Hollande says he told his fellow EU leaders straight after the referendum that the UK would have to pay a price: ""Brexit might lead to a slippery slope where others, and particularly those under the sway of populists, might decide to follow what the British have just been doing."" EU leaders sensed that populism was on the march. Brexit was followed by the election of Donald Trump. When the new US president called the other President Donald - Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council - he asked a question with a hint of menace: ""Who's next?"" With elections due in France and the Netherlands in 2017, this was no mere taunt. The leader of the French National Front, Marine Le Pen, was campaigning for ""Frexit"". Polls suggested victory was likely for the Dutch far right leader Geert Wilders. Hungary, Austria and Italy were already governed by politicians who were highly critical of the EU. There were tears in the office of Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, when he and his officials heard that the UK had voted to leave. Juncker's right hand man was a formidable German lawyer called Martin Selmayr, thought by many to be the most important man in Brussels. Giving his first British broadcast interview to Panorama, he says: ""I think the most important thing at this moment in time was to preserve the unity of the other 27 member states - to make sure that in the process that followed, all 27 saw eye to eye â¦[and] to use this moment not to further weaken the [European] Union, not the beginning of the end, but the start of a new beginning for the European project,"" says Selmayr. When Selmayr met the British minister he knew best, David Lidington,  who'd been Minister for Europe for many years and who would go on to become Theresa May's de facto deputy - he spelt out what this would mean. Lidington recalls this conversation: ""He said to me, 'Look David, there's not going to be the traditional EU late into the night, into the wee small hours, horse trading on this. It'll be the Commission that your side talks to. We are not going to give your prime minister the chance to try and pick us off."" The UK was no longer to be treated like a member of the club, in which it could seek to build alliances and divide and rule the 27 countries still inside. It would be treated as if it had already left. Negotiations would take place not with representatives of every country but with a team led by one man - a suave silver-haired Frenchman called Michel Barnier. In his first British broadcast interview since the negotiations began, he told Panorama: ""Everybody will have to pay a price - EU and UK - because there is no added value to Brexit. Brexit is a negative negotiation. It is a lose-lose game for everybody."" Philip Hammond didn't like what he was hearing. Theresa May was delivering her first speech as prime minister to the Conservative Party Conference in 2016, and her new chancellor of the Exchequer was sitting in the audience. ""I was trying to keep my face dead straight, conscious that there were cameras on me,"" he says. May began by saying that ""Brexit means Brexit and we're going to make a success of it"". That came as no surprise to Hammond. He'd heard her use the phrase many times before. But then the prime minister continued: ""Our laws will be made not in Brussels but in Westminster. The authority of EU law in Britain will end."" That meant that the UK would have to leave the single market. It could not stay as close as possible to the EU economically - like Norway or Switzerland. Hammond says that he had not been consulted about the speech or the policy: ""I didn't know. I think the prime minister felt that as a former remainer she needed to demonstrate her credentials by presenting quite an extreme version of Brexit. Some of the things that were being said were likely to have quite an impact outside the hall."" Senior EU figures were watching and concluded that the prime minister had outlined a series of undeliverable red lines. The man who'd written the speech was May's powerful chief of staff Nick Timothy. A passionate leaver, he had also dreamed up ""Brexit means Brexit"" - a phrase that was much less empty than it seemed. ""I plead guilty to that phrase. It was one of the most irritating in British politics. ""Funnily enough it actually meant three different things. Firstly, that she understood that having been a remainer when the country voted to leave she would deliver on that mandate. ""It was [also] a warning to others - I think in particular in Parliament who were already showing signs of not really accepting the result - that Brexit must mean Brexit. Then at a third level that Brexit must meaningfully mean Brexit and couldn't be a kind of shadow membership."" Click here to watch Panorama: Britain's Brexit Crisison BBC One, 18 July at 21:00 In the same speech, May announced that she would soon begin the formal process of leaving the EU by triggering Article 50. Hammond believes this was a mistake, given that there had been no real debate in the government, let alone the country, about what Brexit should mean. ""With the benefit of hindsight, I can now see that that was wrong,"" he says. ""The real issue is debating with ourselves what kind of Brexit Britain wants.  And we should have done that before we triggered the process."" The chancellor says there was always going to be a tension between protecting the economy and ""taking back control"" of policies like immigration. It was a tension that was never fully resolved. ""... She hoped to improve her position and make it easier to deliver what people voted for in the referendum but actually the result made that job even more difficult."" Gavin Barwell lost his seat as a Conservative MP when Theresa May called a general election in June 2017. He was hired as her new chief of staff, replacing Nick Timothy - the man blamed by many for her decision to go to the polls. The election  left her with no majority in the House of Commons. ""Those first few weeks were a pretty traumatic experience,"" says Barwell. ""That was apparent from the first day I walked into No 10."" The US President Lyndon B Johnson said: ""The first rule of politics - you have to be able to count."" In other words, leaders need to be sure that they have more people backing their policies than opposing them. May with Arlene Foster, whose DUP party the prime minister turned to for support The votes of Tory MPs alone would not now give May a majority. She turned to Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) for support. What she didn't do - until it was far too late - was to try to woo opposition MPs.  That was what Ted Heath had done before he took Britain into the Common Market in 1973. Incidentally, it was not just May's closest advisers and cabinet ministers who helped convince her to call an election. Allies of Jean-Claude Juncker, a former prime minister himself, admit that while he would never have advised her to call an election, he did tell her that having her own mandate would help her. Juncker warned that a tiny majority in a House of Commons that was less enthusiastic about Brexit than the British public would cause real problems when she eventually needed MPs to ratify a Brexit deal with the EU. ""...The UK chose itself the date for leaving in March 2019. This is why every time I just recall the clock is ticking. Be careful eh?"" Again and again, Michel Barnier reminded British ministers that they would have just two years to reach agreement. It was clearly stated in Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty that set the rules for how a country could leave the EU.  It allowed Brussels to use time against the UK. Senior figures in government have told me that the UK side misunderstood Barnier's real role. He was the public face of the negotiations and the politician who would keep the leaders of the EU's 27 countries on side. Barnier's deputies did the real negotiating, alongside Martin Selmayr - the man whose nickname in Brussels is ""the Monster"" - who really decided what could and could not be agreed by the EU. Selmayr explains the thinking behind the process for the Brexit negotiations, that would give the EU control not just of the timetable but also the agenda and the order [or sequencing] of the talks. Barnier with EU deputy chief negotiator for Brexit Sabine Weyand ahead of a meeting to discuss Article 50 ""Brexit will always be a sad event because it's a divorce. First of all you separate the assetsâ¦ the rights and duties that are stemming from 40 years of a very long and intense and close relationship. Then you see if you remain friends afterwards or if you can remain close friends afterwards."" In 2017, Brexit Secretary David Davis promised a long hot summer when he would fight the idea that the UK would have to agree the Brexit bill it owed - which would run into tens of billions of pounds - before any talks could begin on a future trading relationship with the EU. In the event the fight never occurred. He claims that he was overruled by May: ""She felt pressurised, unconfident, maybe even insecure after the general election outcome. She gave away the fact that we were going to meet everything they wanted - money and citizens' rights and so on - and get nothing back in return."" David Davis never persuaded the rest of the cabinet, let alone the prime minister herself, to make the threat summed up in another of her oft-repeated phrases - ""no deal is better than a bad deal"" - appear credible. ""The Treasury in particular would always argue you can't frighten the horses,"" he says. ""Don't talk about it publicly, don't say what needs to be done, don't do the public preparation."" Davis complains that the chancellor was so nervous of spooking business that he stopped the Brexit department sending out letters to tens of thousands of small businesses telling them to prepare for a no-deal Brexit. Hammond counters that he was trying to reassure business to stay in the country and to keep investing, so the last thing he wanted was anything that would have the appearance of no deal. ""There was a tension at the beginning. We didn't want to send business a message that we're going to crash out of the EU and see businesses perhaps relocating - taking jobs out of the United Kingdom."" The official projections were clear. A no-deal Brexit would lead to 10% tariffs on car exports, and 40% tariffs on the sale of lamb, says Hammond, as well as potential chaos at Dover with the French being able to ""dial up and dial down"" the queues at will to make a political point. Hammond was not alone. One of the top officials handling Brexit told ministers that threatening no deal was like taking the pin out of a grenade and holding it next to your own head. When I asked Michel Barnier if May or her ministers had ever made a no deal threat behind closed doors, he replied emphatically, ""No"", before adding, ""I think that the UK side, which is well informed and competent and knows the way we work on the EU side, knew from the very beginning that we've never been impressed by such a threat. It's not useful to use it."" Selmayr agreed. ""I don't think it's ever a reality for anybody who is in a responsible position. It has consequences. It ruins your relationship for the future and I don't think anybody responsible on the UK side or the EU side has an interest in that,"" he said. In fact, when I asked Selmayr if he thought the UK was prepared for that eventuality, he said he was ""very certain"" it was not. ""We have seen what has been prepared on our side of the border for a hard Brexit,"" he said. ""We don't see the same level of preparation on the other side of the border. ""... That would be in many ways a symbol of the past of tragedy, of emotion, of terrorism, of murder."" It was not just in Brussels that Brexit was seen as a threat. In Dublin, Simon Coveney - who is now Ireland's Tanaiste, or deputy head of government - says he feared that there would be a return to a hard Irish border unless the issue was addressed right at the beginning of the negotiations. Other senior figures in the Irish government have told the BBC that they were concerned that Ireland could be ""dragged out"" of the EU by its bigger, richer neighbour. That is why the backstop - the issue which came to dog Brexit - was born. After Brexit, the border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic would be the only land border between the EU and the UK. If peace was to continue, everyone agreed that there should be no border controls. However, the EU's desire to protect its single market would mean there had to bechecks on certain goodssuch as farm animals and chemicals that crossed the border. The argument went that a post-Brexit Britain might do a trade deal with Donald Trump's US and could agree to allow the import of chlorine-washed chicken or hormone-treated meat. Without a border, those banned goods could move from north to south and into the EU, undercutting European food standards and representing cheap and unfair competition to their farmers. A No Border No Brexit sticker close to the Hands Across the Divide peace statue Controls designed to enforce EU rules could become a target for paramilitaries and encourage smuggling which for years was key to the financing of terrorism. If the UK followed EU rules and regulations, this wouldn't be a problem but Ireland and the EU demanded a guarantee - or a backstop - that whatever trade deal was eventually signed between the two sides there could never be a hard border. Brexiteers saw this as a trap designed to keep the UK bound to EU rules and in a customs union. Talking to the BBC, the former Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab, sums up their fears: ""The idea that you could leave the EU, be successful and demonstrate that the EU perhaps wasn't all it was cut out to be was for them the thing that made [the EU]    the most nervous. And the obvious answer to that was to try and lock the United Kingdom in to as many EU rules as possible without any say over them and without any means to escape from that regime, and that's the conundrum of the backstop."" Raab's predecessor David Davis agrees with this position: ""They needed a lever which put us in the wrong and them in the right, I think that's the way they saw it. [With] the Irish border there's a strong political, moral, sentimental argument... based on fiction really, but nevertheless that's how it's used."" In other words the backstop was as much about trade as it was about peace. It was as much about French determination to protect the single market as it was about Irish worries about a new source of conflict. One of May's closest allies told us it was the ""operationalisation by Brussels of a French idea dressed in a green jersey"". So why did the prime minister sign up to it? Because the clock was ticking and because she'd agreed to the EU's sequencing of the talks. No backstop meant no progress to talking about trade. What's more, Theresa May was desperate to get agreement to the Treasury's top priority, which was the demand from big business for an extra two years to adapt to Brexit - the so-called transition period. Davis blames No 10 for agreeing to the backstop. ""They signed up to the backstop because they were desperate to make progress. They basically had a loss of nerve."" When we put to Martin Selmayr that the deal was ""swallow what you don't much like on Ireland, and get more time"", he replies: ""Absolutely."" ""Let's get the UK involved with France and Germany. Let's see how the dust settles and let's talk about whether we can come to a new deal for Europe."" Britain's de facto deputy prime minister David Lidington reveals to Panorama that he was made that startling offer by Martin Selmayr. It followed a summit of world leaders at which EU heads found themselves on the same side as Theresa May in a series of arguments with President Trump. Selmayr explains why the offer was made: ""All the other European leaders were left behind when he [Trump] took the helicopter and they looked each other in the eyes and also at Theresa May and they thought, 'At least we all agree with each other, we are the last bastion of the rules-based international system.' I think that led to many thinking, 'Well, if she comes back tomorrow and has thought again, we wouldn't mind'."" Donald Tusk once joked in public about the idea that Brexit could be reversed saying, ""Who knows? You may say I'm a dreamer, but I'm not the only one."" However, this is the first time it has been confirmed that an approach and an offer was made by the European Commission to put Brexit on ice. The offer was rejected and some in the EU came to the view it would be better if the UK left - and left quickly. However, the scale of opposition Theresa May faced in Parliament meant others continued to believe and hope that there would be another referendum and Brexit would not happen. This made them less likely to compromise. May and members of her Cabinet meet at her country retreat Chequers ""The two big parties have been trying to outmanoeuvre each other on Brexit, and for a long time Brexit has been used by the opposition party as a way of trying to trigger a general election. For me, as somebody who loves Britain, who's lived there, who's studied there, who has family there, I think it's a tragedy quite frankly, that in the face of this huge decision that the British people have made, that the political system has not been able to unite behind a middle-ground position and unite the country."" Simon Coveney is scathing about the failure of the British Parliament and political system to achieve consensus on Brexit. It's a stark contrast with the unity which has been on show in Dublin. He blames the opposition Labour Party as well as the Tories. The government's Chief Whip, Julian Smith, says that he has lost a lot of sleep as a result of trying - and failing - to get a deal through the House of Commons. ""I think that there was definitely a shift from some Brexiteers who, if you'd asked them three years ago, would they be happy with the prime minister's deal, they'd have bitten your arm off. They then, during the course of the last year, became, I think, increasingly concerned about different elements of it, seeing some form of threat behind many aspects of it, and there was a kind of purification process - they sort of wanted everything on day one."" The Tories were hopelessly divided over what sort of Brexit deal to pursue. When May finally proposed her ""Chequers plan"" she did it without ensuring that she had the support of David Davis, her Brexit secretary . Her allies believe that if Davis had been offered another job, he would have taken it rather than quitting the Cabinet altogether. They believe that Boris Johnson might then have stayed in the government.  As it was he became the figurehead for those wanting to ""chuck Chequers"" and, eventually, to chuck Theresa May as well. The chief whip also blames the Speaker for blocking Brexit.  John Bercow ruled that the government could not bring back its withdrawal agreement to the Commons after it had been defeated twice. By this time, even hardliners like Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg were prepared to vote with the government. No 10 insiders claim that they had the basis of an agreement which could have got DUP support as well but the vote was never held. ""Parliament is and has been deadlocked for one simple reason,"" says Julian Smith. ""Large groups of MPs have been prepared to gamble that they could force the outcome they wanted - a harder Brexit or another referendum or a general election - rather than backing Theresa May's deal."" ""If the only goal of the EU is this market obviously you could think that the German car industry could force the German government to comply with the demands coming out of London, but for Germany the EU is much, much more than a market. It's their destiny, it's not revisiting the horrors of history so even the car industry itself understands that this is fundamentally more important than selling cars to the United Kingdom."" EU leaders such as Frans Timmermans believe that British politicians do not understand the idealism and the history which underlies the European project. He says that ""continental Europeans"" do not see the EU in the same way as the United Kingdom - ""as a market"". Brexiteers like Boris Johnson don't dispute the history but they do doubt that the leaders of any country would willingly harm their own economies. He has said in public that EU countries will want to sell us their cars or cheese or even Prosecco. Did that claim infuriate Timmermans? ""Yes it did, also, perhaps I'm being a bit harsh but it's about time we became a bit harsh also because I'm not sure he [Johnson] was being genuine, I always have the impression he's playing games."" German Chancellor Angela Merkel meets May in Berlin to discuss Brexit, ahead of a summit of European Union leaders in Brussels David Lidington - a lifelong pro-European - agrees that the EU has always seen itself as a political project but says it takes two to create a misunderstanding. He says that EU leaders have too often dismissed British demands as driven purely by short-term political pressures rather than principle: ""They thought Tories were simply pandering to UKIP or the DUP and never understood that Euroscepticism, a desire for sovereignty, support for the Union were real forces that any political leader and party would have to address."" Those misunderstandings have dogged the Brexit negotiations as both sides have miscalculated how the other side will react. What has not been tested yet is whether the credible threat of no deal, a refusal to compromise on the Irish border and a willingness to withhold the Â£39bn divorce bill which Britain has agreed to pay will improve or destroy the chances of getting a deal.

MPs call for halt to use of facial recognition,"The police and other authorities should suspend use of automatic facial recognition technologies, according to an influential group of MPs. The House of Commons Science and Technology committee added there should be no further trials of the tech until relevant regulations were in place. It raised accuracy and bias concerns. And it warned that police forces were failing to edit a database of custody images to remove pictures of unconvicted individuals. ""It is unclear whether police forces are unaware of the requirement to review custody images every six years, or if they are simply 'struggling to comply',""the committee's report said,external. ""What is clear, however, is that they have not been afforded any earmarked resources to assist with the manual review and weeding process."" As a consequence, the MPs warned, innocent people's pictures might illegally be included in facial recognition ""watch lists"" that are used in public spaces by the police to stop and even arrest suspects. The committee noted that it had flagged similar concerns a year ago but had seen little progress from the Home Office since. By contrast, it said, the Scottish Executive had commissioned an independent review into how biometric data should be used and stored. The report comes a weekafter the Home Secretary Sajid Javidsaid he backed police trials of facial recognition systems, while acknowledging that longer-term use would require legislation. Earlier this month,the Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham,externalsaid the police's use of live facial recognition tech raised ""significant privacy and data protection issues"" and might even breach data protection laws. The civil rights group Liberty has also supported a legal challenge to South Wales Police's use of the technology in a case that has yet to be ruled on by a judge at Cardiff High Court. And theSurveillance Camera Commissioner Tony Porter has criticised,externaltrials by London's Metropolitan Police saying: ""We are heading towards a dystopian society where people aren't trusted, where they are logged and their data signatures are tracked"". The Home Office, however, has noted that there is public support for live facial recognition to identify potential terrorists and people wanted for serious violent crimes. ""The government believes that there is a legal framework for the use of live facial recognition technology, although that is being challenged in the courts and we would not want to pre-empt the outcome of this case,"" said a spokesman. ""However, we support an open debate about this, including how we can reduce the privacy impact on the public. It also recently revealed that Kent and West Midlands' forces plan to test facial recognition software to retrospectively analyse CCTV recordings to spot missing and vulnerable people. ""The public would expect the police to consider all new technologies that could make them safer,"" a spokesman for the National Police Chiefs' council told the BBC. ""Any wider roll out of this technology must be based on evidence showing it to be effective with sufficient safeguards and oversight."" As part of its report, the committee highlighted earlier work that had raised concerns of bias. It referred specifically to a government advisory group that had warned in February that facial recognition systems could produce inaccurate results if they had not been trained on a diverse enough range of data. This video can not be played How one man was fined Â£90 after objecting to being filmed by police ""If certain types of faces - for example, black, Asian and ethnic minority faces or female faces - are under-represented in live facial recognition training datasets, then this bias will feed forward into the use of the technology by human operators,""the ethics group had cautioned,external. While police officers were supposed to double-check matches made by the system by other means before taking action, the group also warned that there was a risk that they might ""start to defer to the algorithm's decision"" without doing so. As such, the committee said that ministers needed to set clearer limits on the tech's use. ""We call on the government to issue a moratorium on the current use of facial recognition technology and no further trials should take place until a legislative framework has been introduced and guidance on trial protocols, and an oversight and evaluation system, has been established,"" it concluded. One think tank chief welcomed the recommendation but said the real problems were not ones of bias or accuracy. ""These are a distraction from the wider question of whether we want to have this technology at all,"" Areeq Chowdhury from Future Advocacy told the BBC. ""Before any further deployment of facial recognition by the police, we need to have a public conversation about whether we are happy for our faces to become a tool of national security."" The committee also flagged issues with the way custody images were being stored in the Police National Database. As of February 2018,the PND had 12.5 million images available to facial recognition searches,external. People who have been acquitted or had charges against them dropped can apply to have their images removed. But the MPs noted that despite guidance that images of unconvicted individuals should be removed by hand after six years, this was not being done. ""The government should strengthen the requirement for such a manual process to delete custody images and introduce clearer and stronger guidance on the process,"" the committee's report said. ""In the long-term the government should invest in automatic deletion software as previously promised."" The privacy campaign Big Brother Watch supported the call. ""This practice was ruled unlawful by the High Court in 2012 - it is shameful that the government has failed to act,"" said Griff Ferris, the group's legal and policy officer.

Dangerous dogs law 'not fit for purpose',"Ryan Booth's ear was torn off in the attack A mother has told how her six-year-old son's ear was torn off by two dogs that were kept off the leash. Claire Booth was out walking with son Ryan near their home in Bishopton, Renfrewshire, when she says two English bull terriers came ""from nowhere"" and ""dragged him around the ground"". Four years on, the mother says her family are still wary of open spaces. It comes as a Scottish Parliament committee claimed that dog control legislation is ""not fit for purpose"". Recalling the attack, Ms Booth told BBC Radio Scotland'sGood Morning Scotland: ""From a distance the owner of the two dogs were shouting 'don't worry they won't hurt you'. ""But as I managed to get Ryan up, his left ear had been bitten off - his earlobe had been detached from his head. There was blood everywhere, his whole face was distorted. ""He had a bite to his elbow, a bite to his hip and teeth marks embedded on his forehead. His whole face was bruised and battered, his whole body was bruised and battered. ""As a result of that Ryan has now got another three surgeries to face to rebuild his ear and he's now terrified of dogs. We are getting over that now but it has taken nearly four years for that to happen."" Ryan's ear has been left disfigured from the 2015 attack Although they did not witness the attack, Ryan's siblings are also scared of dogs having heard about the trauma he went through. Ms Booth said she was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder following the incident in 2015. The dogs' owner was prosecuted and received the maximum community service sentence. One dog was destroyed, but the other was given a control order which was never followed up. Ms Booth said: ""I felt it was farcical because the owner of the dog moved away to another area which means the dog control order was never followed up - the dog wardens didn't know where they were. ""The owner was supposed to take it to behavioural classes, have it on the lead at all times and be muzzled at all times - but nobody knows if that happened or not."" Ms Booth told a Holyrood committee that the attack on her son involved a bull terrier New laws were introduced in Scotland in 2010 but MSPs recently heard evidence there was still an ""unacceptably high prevalence of dog attacks"". Holyrood's post-legislative scrutiny committee said they considered it to be ""nothing less than a national crisis"". MSPs said the impact on victims, particularly on children, could be life-changing. The Control of Dogs Act 2010 was introduced to promote responsible dog ownership but the committee said it was not working. Its report called on the Scottish government to undertake a comprehensive review of all dog control laws immediately. Committee convener Jenny Marra said: ""There are still far too many dog attacks on children and little enforcement or understanding of the current laws that might prevent these attacks."" She called for urgent reform so that dangerous dogs can be dealt with properly. Some attack victims and their families want to see dogs kept on leads in public places The 2010 legislation brought in a new regime of ""dog control notices"" to impose measures on the people who do not keep their dog under control. It gave Scottish ministers the power to establish a national database of dog control notices so information could be shared across the country. The MSPs said the failure of ministers to use its powers was a ""missed opportunity"". They also said there were too few dog control wardens to enforce the current law and a lack of awareness of how it worked. The committee said that police, hospitals and local authorities were not keeping consistent data on dog attacks. Claire Booth told the committee about the attack while she and Ryan collected chestnuts Earlier this year, the Holyrood Committee heard thatthousands of people are treated each yearby hospital emergency departments for dog-related injuries. Ms Booth was among parents who told the committee about the horrific attacks endured when owners acted irresponsibly. The committee also heard from Radio Clyde journalist Natalie Crawford who initiated a campaign to keep dogs on leads in public places. She discovered that Glasgow City Council - Scotland's largest local authority - until recently had just one part-time dog warden and that there had been no dog control notices issued in a three-year period.

"Dangerous dogs law 'not fit for purpose'New laws were introduced in 2010 but attacks by dogs are still ""unacceptably high"", MSPs hear.ScotlandComments","Ryan Booth's ear was torn off in the attack A mother has told how her six-year-old son's ear was torn off by two dogs that were kept off the leash. Claire Booth was out walking with son Ryan near their home in Bishopton, Renfrewshire, when she says two English bull terriers came ""from nowhere"" and ""dragged him around the ground"". Four years on, the mother says her family are still wary of open spaces. It comes as a Scottish Parliament committee claimed that dog control legislation is ""not fit for purpose"". Recalling the attack, Ms Booth told BBC Radio Scotland'sGood Morning Scotland: ""From a distance the owner of the two dogs were shouting 'don't worry they won't hurt you'. ""But as I managed to get Ryan up, his left ear had been bitten off - his earlobe had been detached from his head. There was blood everywhere, his whole face was distorted. ""He had a bite to his elbow, a bite to his hip and teeth marks embedded on his forehead. His whole face was bruised and battered, his whole body was bruised and battered. ""As a result of that Ryan has now got another three surgeries to face to rebuild his ear and he's now terrified of dogs. We are getting over that now but it has taken nearly four years for that to happen."" Ryan's ear has been left disfigured from the 2015 attack Although they did not witness the attack, Ryan's siblings are also scared of dogs having heard about the trauma he went through. Ms Booth said she was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder following the incident in 2015. The dogs' owner was prosecuted and received the maximum community service sentence. One dog was destroyed, but the other was given a control order which was never followed up. Ms Booth said: ""I felt it was farcical because the owner of the dog moved away to another area which means the dog control order was never followed up - the dog wardens didn't know where they were. ""The owner was supposed to take it to behavioural classes, have it on the lead at all times and be muzzled at all times - but nobody knows if that happened or not."" Ms Booth told a Holyrood committee that the attack on her son involved a bull terrier New laws were introduced in Scotland in 2010 but MSPs recently heard evidence there was still an ""unacceptably high prevalence of dog attacks"". Holyrood's post-legislative scrutiny committee said they considered it to be ""nothing less than a national crisis"". MSPs said the impact on victims, particularly on children, could be life-changing. The Control of Dogs Act 2010 was introduced to promote responsible dog ownership but the committee said it was not working. Its report called on the Scottish government to undertake a comprehensive review of all dog control laws immediately. Committee convener Jenny Marra said: ""There are still far too many dog attacks on children and little enforcement or understanding of the current laws that might prevent these attacks."" She called for urgent reform so that dangerous dogs can be dealt with properly. Some attack victims and their families want to see dogs kept on leads in public places The 2010 legislation brought in a new regime of ""dog control notices"" to impose measures on the people who do not keep their dog under control. It gave Scottish ministers the power to establish a national database of dog control notices so information could be shared across the country. The MSPs said the failure of ministers to use its powers was a ""missed opportunity"". They also said there were too few dog control wardens to enforce the current law and a lack of awareness of how it worked. The committee said that police, hospitals and local authorities were not keeping consistent data on dog attacks. Claire Booth told the committee about the attack while she and Ryan collected chestnuts Earlier this year, the Holyrood Committee heard thatthousands of people are treated each yearby hospital emergency departments for dog-related injuries. Ms Booth was among parents who told the committee about the horrific attacks endured when owners acted irresponsibly. The committee also heard from Radio Clyde journalist Natalie Crawford who initiated a campaign to keep dogs on leads in public places. She discovered that Glasgow City Council - Scotland's largest local authority - until recently had just one part-time dog warden and that there had been no dog control notices issued in a three-year period.

Asos shares slump as it warns on profits,"Shares in Asos have sunk after the online fashion giant said that this year's profits are likely to be much lower than expectations. The retailer said sales growth in the US and Europe had been held back by problems at its warehouses. These problems meant that the range of clothes available to shoppers in these markets had been limited. As a result, it now expects to report profits of Â£30m-Â£35m this year, well below the Â£55m forecast by analysts. Asos chief executive Nick Beighton said overhauling its US and European warehouses had taken longer than anticipated, affecting its ""stock availability, sales and cost base in these regions"". He added that the company was clear on what was causing the problems and was making progress on resolving them. However, Asos said that while the warehouse problems were ""short-term in nature"", it added it might take ""some time"" to regain customers who had been affected. Total sales across the group rose by 12% in the four months to 30 June, Asos said, and in the UK - where trading ""remained robust"" - sales grew by 16%. However, the ""operational challenges"" at its warehouses in Berlin and Atlanta had caused problems in the US and Europe, where sales were up 12% and 5% respectively. Asos has enjoyed rapid growth in recent years as it has benefited from the shift towards shopping online. However, last December it surprised investors with a shock profit warning, and the company's share price has now more than halved over the past year. Shares in Asos opened down 20% on Thursday following the latest warning, before recovering some ground to stand 12% lower. Analysts at Liberum said the latest warning suggested that serious questions needed answering. ""The operational issues in Europe and the US signal to us a lack of enough senior leaders in the business with the adequate skill-set in the business to undertake the complex capital projects ongoing,"" they said. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said: ""Fashion fans have plenty of places from which to buy clothes and so Asos is at risk of losing out to the competition if it cannot fix its problems fast. ""We live in an impatient world where so many people want something in an instant. If Asos doesn't have the stock ready to ship then consumers will simply go elsewhere."" However, Sofie Willmott, an analyst at research firm GlobalData, was more upbeat, arguing that the ""changes being made to US and EU distribution centres are vital to facilitate long-term growth in these key markets"". She added that the future ""remains bright for Asos"". ""The retailer's agility and willingness to change to remain relevant to its customer base will help it to continue gaining market share, both at home and abroad.''

Crimes solved by police at record low,"The proportion of crimes solved by police in England and Wales has fallen to the lowest level recorded, according toHome Office data.,external In the 12 months to March, 7.8% of offences saw someone charged or summonsed, down from 9.1% a year ago. The data began to be compiled in 2015. It comes afterMetropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick acknowledged too many offences were being left unsolved, in a speech about the future of policing. She said sifting through vast amounts of phone and computer data was partly responsible and called for investment in resources, technology and expertise to drive up clear-up rates. You need a modern browser to view the interactive content in this page. Please enter your postcode or police force name There is missing 2018/19 data for this police force area The Home Office said work to improve crime recording by police forces has ""both increased the volume forces are dealing with and changed the crime mix to include more complex cases, such as sexual offences and domestic abuse, which can be more challenging to resolve"". It added: ""At the same time, while more crimes are now being recorded, in a growing proportion of cases the victim either doesn't support further action or police are unable to contact them."" Crime solving rates 'woefully low' Ten charts on the rise of knife crime Separately, the Office for National Statistics said the Crime Survey for England and Wales - based on people's experience - points to no significant change in overall crime in the year to March, although police recorded offences of robbery rose by 11% and knife crime was up 8%. It said the increase in this ""less frequently occurring but higher-harm types of violence"" was consistent with a rising trend in recent years. TheONS figures,externalshow there were 43,516 offences involving a knife or sharp instrument in the 12 months to March - the highest since comparable records began in 2011. The figures exclude Greater Manchester Police which records its data differently. There were a total of 85,736 offences of robbery, but a 3% fall in burglary. The total number of killings increased to 701 offences from 693 in the previous 12 months, excluding terror attacks. The ONS also estimated there were 3.8m fraud offences in the same period, an increase of 17%, but said computer misuse had fallen by about a fifth, driven by a decrease in viruses affecting systems. Meanwhile, figures show there has been a small increase in the number of police officers in England and Wales over the last year. As of March 2019 there were 123,171 officers up from 122,405 the previous year. However, there are still 20,500 fewer officers than there were in 2010. Policing minister Nick Hurd said the chances of being a victim of crime remain low and the government was increasing funding for forces by more than Â£1bn this year, with the recruitment of more than 3,700 additional officers and staff. He said: ""We are also acting to address the root causes of violence and stop young people being drawn into crime in the first place.""

"No-deal Brexit will cause recession, says watchdog","Public borrowing could double next year if there is a no-deal Brexit, the country's spending watchdog says. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) said borrowing would be almost Â£60bn if the UK leaves without a deal - up from Â£29.3bn if it does get a deal. The watchdog said this scenario was based on assumptions that a no-deal Brexit would cause a UK recession. The UK is set to leave the European Union on 31 October. Chances of a no-deal outcome appear to have risen recently, after both Tory leadership contenders said they would be willing to leave the EU without a deal. UK 'will have to face consequences of no deal' No-deal Brexit: What you need to know Faisal Islam: Dilemma for new prime minister The OBR was created in 2010 to give independent analysis of the UK's public finances. In its first assessment,externalof the economic impact of a no-deal scenario, the OBR used IMF analysis that shows the UK economy would contract by 2% in 2020 before recovering in 2021. This would come as tariffs of 4% were imposed on goods traded with the EU - up from zero currently - although the IMF does not expect there to be disruption at the border. In this scenario, the OBR said that ""heightened uncertainty and declining confidence"" would deter investment, while higher trade barriers with the EU would ""weigh on exports"". ""Together, these push the economy into recession, with asset prices and the pound falling sharply,"" it said. It said this could raise inflation and squeeze real incomes. It would also hit tax receipts, causing public sector borrowing to rise and leaving debt 12% higher by 2024. The OBR added this was ""not necessarily the most likely outcome"" but also ""by no means the worst case scenario"". It also warned that both Conservative leadership contenders had made ""a series of uncosted proposals for tax cuts and spending increases that would be likely to increase government borrowing by tens of billions of pounds if implemented"". The government's official independent budgetary watchdog has for the first time put a price on the impact to the public finances of leaving the European Union without a deal. The numbers come at a sensitive time politically when both likely future prime ministers suggest that a no-deal Brexit is possible this year. The OBR is legally obliged to consider all threats to the public finances, and today's new numbers come as part of its bi-annual Fiscal Risks report. The fall in tax revenue is forecast to significantly outweigh any benefit from no longer paying the UK's subscription fee as a member of the EU. The numbers show a deep crisis-like impact on the public finances, and are based on the IMF's projections for the economy. But they go further, showing a long-run hit to the economy. Read more from Faisal This video can not be played Philip Hammond: No-deal would cause 'significant hit' to UK economy The forecast used by the OBR is less severe than those of the Bank of England and the Treasury. In November, the Bank said a no-deal outcome could send the pound plunging and trigger a worse recession than the 2008 financial crisis. The economy could shrink by 8% in the immediate aftermath if there was no transition period, the Bank said. The Treasury meanwhile has predicted a Â£90bn hit to the economy by 2035 - although prominent eurosceptics dispute this view. In a comment piece for the Telegraph newspaper earlier this week, Conservative backbencher Jacob Rees-Mogg called the forecast ""silliness"", adding that a no-deal scenario could instead boost the economy by Â£80bn. On Thursday, Mr Hammond said: ""The report that the OBR has published shows that even in the most benign version of a no-deal exit, there would be a very significant hit to the UK economy. ""But that most benign version is not the version that is being talked about by prominent Brexiteers. They are talking about a much harder version that would cause much more disruption."" Both Jeremy Hunt and Boris Johnson say they are prepared to leave the EU without a deal John McDonnell, Labour's shadow chancellor, said: ""We know that a no-deal Brexit would devastate the UK economy and the public finances, and it comes on top of the failed economic approach for the last nine years. ""This warning makes it even more imperative MPs from across Parliament back today's amendments to try and block the next prime minister from shutting down Parliament to force through a no-deal Brexit."" Chuka Umunna, the Liberal Democrat business and treasury spokesman, said: ""It would be unforgiveable to heap further stress and anxiety on families who are already struggling by deliberately pursuing a policy that the government's own independent economic watchdog now says will result in a recession."" The chances of a no-deal appear to have risen in recent weeks after both candidates in the race to replace Theresa May hardened their positions on the controversial Irish backstop - an insurance policy to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland after Brexit. Jeremy Hunt and Boris Johnson both said the backstop was ""dead"", but the EU said it would not support any deal that excludes it. In an interview with the BBC's Panorama programme - conducted in May before the start of the Conservative leadership contest - the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, said the UK would have to ""face the consequences"" if it opted to leave without a deal. Mr Barnier said the thrice-rejected withdrawal agreement negotiated by Theresa May was the ""only way to leave the EU in an orderly manner"". No-deal Brexit: Who will the new PM believe?

Water bills set to be cut by Â£50 over five years,"Water bills in England and Wales are set to fall by an average of Â£50 between 2020 and 2025, under plans published by the industry regulator. Ofwat said firms would also have to invest an additional Â£6m each day in improving services for customers. It comes amid widespread dissatisfaction with the performance of many water companies. Ofwat said the measures would mean ""better services, a healthier natural environment and lower bills"". ""[Water companies] will be accountable not just for reporting against their performance but they'll face tough penalties if they don't achieve those targets,"" Ofwat boss Rachel Fletcher told the BBC's Today programme. Most water firms fail to meet challenges Thames Water fined Â£120m over leaks Ofwat said the bill reductions would vary widely - falling by Â£7 at Hafren Dyfrdwy to Â£110 at Northumbrian Water compared with 2017-18 prices. It comes after only three out of 17 water firms in England and Wales passed the last review by Ofwat, published in January. All firms submitted plans to cut bills over the 2020-25 period, while reducing leaks and helping vulnerable customers. But only plans from Severn Trent, United Utilities and South West Water were approved. Ofwat wants water companies to spend more on tackling leaks There have also been continued problems with leaks - particularly after extreme weather events such as last year'sBeast from the Easticy spell. While leaks in England and Wales are much lower than they were in the mid-1990s, progress in tackling them has slowed to a crawl since 2001. Firms will now have to invest more in tackling leaks between 2020 and 2025, saving an amount of water equivalent to the needs of the population of Manchester, Leeds, Leicester and Cardiff. They will also have to: Reduce supply interruptions by almost two-thirds, Cut pollution incidents Reduce the number of customers with low water pressure Help some 1.5 million customers who are struggling to pay. Ofwat said this would add up to Â£12bn of new investment - over and above business-as-usual costs - or Â£6m per day over the period. Water companies will be able to make representations about the proposals and the final deals will be confirmed in December. Tony Smith, chief executive of the Consumer Council for Water, called the plans ""good news"", but added: ""Not everyone will see their bills fall when you add inflation and customers need to be told how much Ofwat's financial rewards for companies could hit them in the pocket. ""Only about half of the three million households who struggle to afford their water bills will receive financial assistance under these plans,"" he added.

The lap dancers who joined a union,"This video can not be played Campaigner Megara Furie (left) and lap dancer Kayleigh Barrington have joined the GMB union ""If your job is under threat, you are going to unionise to fight that. Dancing is no different."" The words of Megara Furie, a former lap dancer who now works as a dominatrix. She is the driving force behind a curious chapter in the history of Scottish workers' rights - the unionisation of lap dancers and others who work in the sex industry. ""Unionisation for dancers means having their voices heard,"" Megara continued. ""Having a seat at the table for future discussionsâ¦ means raising standards across the board in all strip clubs and venues they would work in."" Megara was speaking to BBC News at the Seventh Heaven lap dancing bar in Glasgow.Last month, the club signed a union agreement with its staff- the first time a trade union has had a formal presence in Scotland's sex industry. In April, the Scottish government brought in legislation which allows local authorities to limit the number of sex venues - including setting a zero limit if they wish. A month later Glasgow launcheda public consultation,external, asking dancers and the wider public to give their views - should the council decide to take up its newly-acquired power. The council insists no decision has been made but many of the city's lap dancers see it as a threat to their jobs and have turned to the union for support. The GMB campaign #Askthe700 has seen dancers on the city's streets, gathering names on a petition. The campaign aims to ""save Glasgow's strip clubs"", and is named after the union estimate of the number of lap dancers working in Scotland. Megara Furie is a former dancer who is now a dominatrix. Megara said: ""When the consultation was announced, that is what really kick-started the membership. People need a reason to unionise, a reason to organise. ""It has created a lot of passion. There are people who normally would have hidden what they do, and they are coming right out of the woodwork. ""Had the (Glasgow) consultation not taken place, a lot of this would have still been kept indoors, in the shadows."" Over 50 dancers and other members of staff at lap dancing bars have joined GMB. Other councils that have lap dancing bars in their areas are also discussing how to use the new powers.Edinburgh launched its consultation,externalearlier this month, whileAberdeen, Fife and Highland councils told BBC News they plan on holding one. Dundee says it has made ""no decision"" on the issue yet. The term ""sexual entertainment venue"" is not confined to lap dancing bars. It could be a pub or club that hosts a party night with sexual entertainment more than four times within a year. Nine other local authorities who currently have no lap dancing bars,such as Renfrewshire,external, have told the BBC they have either launched a public consultation already or they are considering it. Megara Furie first started talking to the GMB union about allowing sex workers to join a year ago. It followed conversations with other unions, who, she claims, ""shot it down as being violence against women, exploitation, without actually speaking to any of the workers"". Last year, several groups campaigning for action to combat violence against women calledon the Scottish government to make strip clubs illegal as they ""normaliseâ¦misogynistic attitudes"". The government's own strategy,externalincludes ""lap dancing"" in its definition of violence against women. More than 50 people across Glasgow's lap dancing venues - specifically Seventh Heaven and Diamond Dolls - have joined the union since GMB opened up its doors to them. They include dancers, bar staff and security staff. Kayleigh Barrington says dancers should have a say, as it is ""our bodies"" Kayleigh Barrington is a lap dancer at Seventh Heaven. She recently joined the GMB after working in the industry for five years. ""I joined the union because I want my voice to be heard. ""I used to be quite heavy - 17st 3lbs. I was quite discriminated in other jobs I used to apply for. I went and auditioned (as a lap dancer) and I got the job and I was accepted into the dancing world really quickly and easily. ""We are all like sisters - it is a solidarity that we have got."" For Kayleigh, her work as a lap dancer has helped her to fulfil a healthier lifestyle. ""With the flexibility of my job, it gave me the ability to be able to get up and go to the gym. I wasn't sitting at my desk, eating crisps. It gave me the confidence to put myself out there."" ""I am all for being unionised - it is Ask the 700, ask the dancers. It is workers' rights. It is for us. We should be the ones that get the say. ""It is our bodies, so ask us."" The agreement between the Seventh Heaven venue and the GMB union is the first of its kind in Scotland Part of the VIP room of Seventh Heaven, where customers pay Â£100 for 20 minutes with a dancer. The main stage of Seventh Heaven where the dancers perform. At Seventh Heaven, both the club and the union believe that little has changed since the introduction of the union agreement. The club was seen by its dancers as already having favourable working arrangements, such as its ""Safe Home"" agreement which ensures the performers will be escorted to their cars or taxis by security staff. Andrew Cox, the general manager of Seventh Heaven, told the BBC: ""We had no hesitations when the GMB approached us as we have been actively seeking outside recognition of the care and commitment we have for customers, performers and staff."" He believes unionisation has given performers and staff a voice in the debate over licensing regulations. Scotland's local authorities will be making decisions on the future of venues like Seventh Heaven in the coming months. The GMB plan to submit its response to Glasgow's consultation next month, and will respond to the other public consultations launched by councils across the country. A vocal, and now unionised group of lap dancers are making sure their voices are heard in the debate. Public to have their say on lap dancing bars Ministers face calls to ban strip clubs Lap dancers sign union deal with club bosses Glasgow consultation on sex entertainment venues.

Regulator calls for Â£50 cut to water bills,"Water bills in England and Wales are set to fall by an average of Â£50 between 2020 and 2025, under plans published by the industry regulator. Ofwat said firms would also have to invest an additional Â£6m each day in improving services for customers. It comes amid widespread dissatisfaction with the performance of many water companies. Ofwat said the measures would mean ""better services, a healthier natural environment and lower bills"". ""[Water companies] will be accountable not just for reporting against their performance but they'll face tough penalties if they don't achieve those targets,"" Ofwat boss Rachel Fletcher told the BBC's Today programme. Most water firms fail to meet challenges Thames Water fined Â£120m over leaks Ofwat said the bill reductions would vary widely - falling by Â£7 at Hafren Dyfrdwy to Â£110 at Northumbrian Water compared with 2017-18 prices. It comes after only three out of 17 water firms in England and Wales passed the last review by Ofwat, published in January. All firms submitted plans to cut bills over the 2020-25 period, while reducing leaks and helping vulnerable customers. But only plans from Severn Trent, United Utilities and South West Water were approved. Ofwat wants water companies to spend more on tackling leaks There have also been continued problems with leaks - particularly after extreme weather events such as last year'sBeast from the Easticy spell. While leaks in England and Wales are much lower than they were in the mid-1990s, progress in tackling them has slowed to a crawl since 2001. Firms will now have to invest more in tackling leaks between 2020 and 2025, saving an amount of water equivalent to the needs of the population of Manchester, Leeds, Leicester and Cardiff. They will also have to: Reduce supply interruptions by almost two-thirds, Cut pollution incidents Reduce the number of customers with low water pressure Help some 1.5 million customers who are struggling to pay. Ofwat said this would add up to Â£12bn of new investment - over and above business-as-usual costs - or Â£6m per day over the period. Water companies will be able to make representations about the proposals and the final deals will be confirmed in December. Tony Smith, chief executive of the Consumer Council for Water, called the plans ""good news"", but added: ""Not everyone will see their bills fall when you add inflation and customers need to be told how much Ofwat's financial rewards for companies could hit them in the pocket. ""Only about half of the three million households who struggle to afford their water bills will receive financial assistance under these plans,"" he added.

Ten dead in suspected arson at Japan anime studio,"This video can not be played Kyoto Animation offices on fire At least 33 people died and dozens were injured after a man set fire to an animation studio in the Japanese city of Kyoto, officials say. Police said the 41-year-old suspect broke into the Kyoto Animation studio on Thursday morning and sprayed petrol before igniting it. The suspect has been detained and was taken to hospital with injuries. Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said the incident was ""too appalling for words"" and offered condolences. It is one of Japan's worst mass casualty incidents since World War Two. Kyoto Animation, known as KyoAni, produces films and graphic novels, and is well regarded by fans for the quality of its productions. The fire broke out at the three-storey building at about 10:30 local time (01:35 GMT) on Thursday. Rescue operations are still ongoing. KyoAni: The beloved studio making distinctive art Police also found knives at the scene, say local media. Public broadcaster NHK said the man had been heard saying ""drop dead"" as he set fire to the building. The suspect's relationship with the company is unclear. It took firefighters five hours to bring the blaze under control, reports said Eyewitnesses described a loud explosion followed by an inferno that rapidly engulfed the building. ""I saw some people with burns, covered with something. They were rushed to the ambulance,"" one neighbour said. Volunteer fire corps members stand guard in front of the Kyoto Animation building The official, Kazuhiro Hayashi, said most of the casualties had been on the stairs to the top floor, where they apparently collapsed trying to escape. Firefighters said they had found 33 bodies, two on the first floor, 11 on the second floor and 20 on the stairs from the third floor to the top floor, he said. Some 36 people are in hospital, some in a critical condition, reports say. About 70 people were in the building when the fire started. Reports say the man is not a former employee - but eyewitnesses say he appeared to be angry with the animation studio. They said he ran away from the building towards a nearby train station after the fire started but fell to the ground. Some reports said he was pursued by employees of Kyoto Animation. Emergency crew wheel a stretcher away from the building in the city of Kyoto ""A person with singed hair was lying down and there were bloody footprints,"" a 59-year-old woman living nearby told news agency Kyodo. ""He seemed to be in pain, irritated and suffering, but also angry as if he was resentful. I heard him saying something like 'You copied it',"" a neighbour said. The Asahi Shimbun newspaper quoted a 61-year-old neighbour as sayingshe clearly heard the man shout,external: ""You ripped me off."" The suspect was injured and was being treated in hospital, so police could not immediately question him, NHK said. Japanese media reports said a man in his 40s had earlier bought 40 litres (nine gallons) of petrol at a nearby petrol station. Two containers used for the fuel were later found at the scene of the fire, Asahi Shimbun newspaper reported. Meanwhile Kyoto Animation Director Hideaki Hatta told the broadcaster that the company had recently received threatening emails. ""They were addressed to our office and sales department and told us to die,"" he said. Mr Hatta told reporters that he was ""heartbroken"" at the attack. ""It is unbearable that the people who helped carry Japan's animation industry were hurt and lost their lives in this way,"" he said. Kyoto Animation, known as KyoAni, was founded in 1981 and has produced popular animation shows including K-On and The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya. The studio also released a standalone feature anime A Silent Voice in 2016. One of KyoAni's series, Violet Evergarden, was picked up by Netflix for a global market. Floral tributes have been left outside the building as people pay their respects to the victims It also publishes many popular graphic novels, mainly about teenage school life. The studio is known for paying its animators a regular salary, breaking with the industry's standard of paying per frame - which is seen as putting extreme pressure on staff. It is also the first successful studio outside Tokyo, Prof Ryusuke Hikawa from Meiji University told NHK. Japanese anime has a huge following not just in Japan but around the world. On social media, many fans have been expressing their shock and posting pictures of their favourite KyoAni shows. A GoFundMe campaign titled ""Help KyoAni Heal"" has also been started, with more than $300,000 (Â£240,000) raised in six hours. Voiceover artist SungWon Cho - who works on anime films - was among those to react. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

999 attack crackdown law 'not a deterrent',"This video can not be played A North Yorkshire PCSO says he had to explain to his young children how he was attacked A new law to crack down on assaults on emergency service staff is not proving enough of a deterrent, according to the MP who campaigned for the legislation. The law, brought in last year, meant offenders faced longer jail terms. Figures obtained by the BBC showed police across England and Wales have made more than 6,500 arrests for attacks on emergency service workers. Halifax MP Holly Lynch said government ""needed to get really tough on this"" as the numbers were ""still too high"". A big part of the so-called ""Protect the Protectors"" law was an increase in sentences available to magistrates and judges from six months to 12 months. Ms Lynch said: ""It didn't go quite as far as we would like in terms of being a deterrent. ""What I'm seeing far too often is when sentences are handed out they are suspended sentences or things like community resolutions... which is not enforceable."" A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: ""Attacking our hard-working emergency staff will not be tolerated and the law was brought in so those who commit such violence quite rightly face a stronger punishment, doubling the sentence from six months to 12."" Firefighter David Gillian described how he was temporarily blinded when a firework was thrown at him and his colleagues in Keighley, West Yorkshire, on Bonfire Night in 2016. ""The fire had been set, we believe, to draw us into that corner and the fireworks were coming from behind us. ""I was holding the hose reel at the time and one fell right between my feet so my reaction was to look straight at it and put the water on it. But, before I could, it went off."" Mr Gillian said imposing harsher sentences was ""just masking societal problems"" and the attacks were largely down to disaffected people who had nothing to lose. ""These kind of attacks are highly linked with deprivation,"" he said. ""We need investment in public services and communities to give people opportunities, hope and the thought of doing something better with their lives than attacking emergency services."" Thirty-four out of 43 police forces responded to a BBC Freedom of Information request asking how many arrests there had been under the Assaults on Emergency Workers (Offences) Act 2018. Figures revealed a total of 6,663 arrests between last November and May of this year. Urine bottles thrown at nurses Police called 'every day' to NHS violence Officer's attack 'darkest moment in life' In West Yorkshire, where there were 504 arrests, the police federation said up to 50 officers were being assaulted every week. Chairman Brian Booth said: ""They're getting head-butted, they're getting punched, kicked. ""Some are getting quite serious injuries where they're having a substantial amount of time off work and this impacts on demand because the public aren't getting the service they need from the officers."" Mr Booth said although there was a maximum sentence set, it was ""no good if you're not using it"". MP Holly Lynch started campaigning for a change in the law in 2016 Policeman's daughter Ms Lynch was instrumental in lobbying MPs to support the legislation, which she first introduced as a Ten Minute Rule Bill in 2016. Her campaign was the result of first-hand experience while she was shadowing West Yorkshire Police. A routine vehicle stop escalated and the officer she was with found himself surrounded by an angry mob with the Labour MP having to call 999 for back-up.
