Worst to come for food price rises - Tesco,"John Allan said the cost of living squeeze will hit the ""hardest-up still harder"". The chairman of Britain's biggest supermarket has warned ""the worst is yet to come"" on rising food prices. Tesco's John Allan told the BBC he was aware people were on very tight budgets and having to choose between food and heating ""troubles us"". But he said grocers and suppliers were not immune from rising energy costs. Mr Allan also defended Tesco against claims from food poverty activist Jack Monroe that the costs of basic staples were rising faster than other goods. He estimated supermarket prices could rise as much as 5% by the spring as energy and other costs feed through to the High Street, adding that Tesco's food price inflation in the last three months had been contained to about 1%. ""We are impacted by rising energy prices, our suppliers are impacted by rising energy prices. So the likelihood is that that inflation figure will rise,"" he said. Mr Allan said he recognised the cost of food took up a bigger proportion of household budgets for people on lower incomes. People having to choose between heating their homes and feeding their families ""troubles us, and I'm sure troubles many people... That's clearly not a situation that any of us should tolerate,"" he said. A report earlier this month from the British Retail Consortium said food inflation accelerated to 2.7% in January, up from 2.4% in December. Why are prices rising so quickly? Fury after Bank boss says don't ask for big pay rise Jack Monroe hails inflation-measure shake-up Annual UK inflation is currently 5.4%, a 30-year high, and is predicted to top 7% this year. Meanwhile, the cost of energy is set to soar under new price-cap rules, prompting the chancellor to unveil a support package for households last week. Mr Allan said: ""I think the combination of increasing energy prices, the impact of National Insurance increases [in April] on people's incomes, and to a much much lesser extent increasing food prices, is going to squeeze the hardest-up still harder."" The pressure facing poorer households was highlighted by Jack Monroe this month in analysis she said showed that everyday essentials, such as the cheapest own-brand pasta or rice, were going up in price by more than the official inflation rate. Mr Allan said he could not speak for the rest of the industry, but it was untrue at Tesco. ""Price rises depend on individual products - coffee is going up, but other things like the cheapest tin of baked beans in Tesco is cheaper than it was five years ago,"" he said. ""As far as Tesco is concerned, we have 2,100 products on our lowest price. We're either price matching against Aldi, or it's our own exclusive at Tesco range. That number [of products] has been increasing in recent months rather than decreasing, so it's not true,"" Mr Allan said. Sainsbury's declined to comment on whether it also expects price rises to accelerate. But it told the BBC it was ""investing in value more than ever"" to help customers manage the rising cost of living. The BBC has also contacted Morrisons, M&S and Asda for comment. The head of the retail industry's trade body said that across the sector firms are working hard to cut costs. But there is only so much the industry can do to shield shoppers, said Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium. ""It would be impossible to protect consumers from any future rises. As commodity prices, energy prices and transportation costs continue to rise, it is inevitable that retail prices will continue to follow in the future,"" she said. Meanwhile, Mr Allan also rejected suggestions from the Bank of England's governor that people should not ask for big pay rises because it was feeding into higher inflation. Andrew Bailey's comments to the BBC were branded a ""sick joke"" by the GMB union, while the TUC said the call was ""ill-founded"". Tesco is the UK's largest private sector employer, with about 300,000 staff. Asked if the company would be telling employees to follow Mr Bailey's advice, Mr Allan said ""no, absolutely not. I think that's the wrong direction for people to go in,"" he said. ""We are not telling people not to take a pay rise. We think our colleagues deserve pay rises,"" Mr Allan said. ""We have given 5-6% raises to our distribution colleagues, and we're in the midst of negotiations, which will probably lead to a similar result for our store colleagues.""

Neighbours under threat after Channel 5 drops show,"The long-running Australian soap has launched the careers of pop stars Jason Donavan and Kylie Minogue Neighbours has been dropped by Channel 5, putting the long-running Australian soap opera's future under threat. The UK network announced on Sunday it would stop showing the programme later this year, after airing it for more than a decade. Singer and former Neighbours star Jason Donovan said the soap ""changed the Australian television landscape"". Australian broadcaster Network 10 said it would look for a new partner to work with to keep it on air. The television network denied filming of the show - which began in 1985 - was being paused. The broadcaster added it was committed to keeping the show going if a new broadcasting partner could be found. Set and filmed in Melbourne, Neighbours was first broadcast in Australia in 1985 and launched on BBC One a year later. It became a huge hit in the UK and in Australia, and helped launch the career of numerous stars, including Kylie Minogue, Jason Donovan, Guy Pearce and later Margot Robbie. Channel 5 said it knew the decision to axe the show - which attracts more than one million viewers per day in the UK - would disappoint many, confirming it would no longer air ""beyond this summer"". But it added its ""current focus is on increasing our investment in original UK drama, which has strong appeal for our UK viewers"". Singer Kylie Minogue was one of the first stars to come out of the programme in the 1980s The soap has featured many notable Australian actors, actresses and performers over the years, many of whom have gone on to have glittering careers. Perhaps the most high profile of these stars to make her name on Neighbours is singer Kylie Minogue, who acted in the early years of the soap, playing Charlene between 1986 and 1988. Russell Crowe briefly featured in the soap opera in 1987 Other people to come off the Ramsay Street set include Oscar winner and Gladiator star Russell Crowe, musician Jason Donovan and actor Guy Pearce. More recently, the show featured Suicide Squad star Margot Robbie from 2008 to 2011 and Liam Hemsworth between 2007 and 2008. Margot Robbie starred in the show before launching her Hollywood career Other people to have made their names from appearing on the show over the years include the singers Natalie Imbruglia, Holly Vallance and Delta Goodrem. Actor and singer Donovan, who played Scott Robinson from 1986 to 1989, wrote on Twitter: ""It launched many careers over decades including mine. ""Engaged and entertained audiences for generations. Hoping that it will find a new home with another UK broadcaster and continue to provide opportunity and entertainment."" Former BBC One controller Lord Grade told Radio 4's Today programme that he initially put the soap in ""the wrong slot"" before a conversation with his school-age daughter made him think again. In a statement, Network 10 said: ""As outlined in the email to Neighbours cast and crew, it is our intention to continue our association with Neighbours if another broadcast partner comes forward. ""Network 10 has an ongoing commitment to the show, the cast and crew and is hopeful that Fremantle will find a new production partner. We will provide further updates as they become available."" The soap, which launched in 1985, has been more popular in the UK than in Australia for years - so Channel 5's announcement has thrown its future into doubt. In Australia it has been shown on digital channel 10 Peach since 2011, when it lost a slot following the nightly news on the main Network 10 schedule, leaving it reliant on the UK broadcaster for production costs. This video can not be played The soap aired a special scene in January 2020 about the bushfires that were devastating Australia at the time Fremantle Media, which makes the soap, is yet to comment. However, in an email to staff, Fremantle Media executive producer Jason Herbison said production would stop indefinitely because of the lack of a broadcast partner to provide financial backing. In the message, seen by theSydney Morning Herald,external, staff were asked to attend a meeting on Monday by Mr Herbison, who added filming would go on until 10 June. The email said: ""Our audience remains steady and Channel Ten would love the show to continue if we could find another broadcast partner to replace [Channel 5]. ""These discussions are ongoing, however there is no new broadcaster at the moment and production must end, effectively resting the show. ""We are so proud of the show, you all and everything that you've achieved. But for now, this chapter is closing and we want to work together to give Neighbours the amazing send-off it deserves."" The soap has featured many guest stars from the UK in recent years, including Amanda Holden, Sophie Ellis-Bextor, Ryan Thomas and Janet Street-Porter. In 2016, BBC Newsround had kidsreact to the show's iconic wedding scenebetween Scott and Charlene - played by Donovan and Minogue - from 1988. One boy described their hair styles as ""long, shaggy and uncut"", adding he was unsure if ""they had barbers in those days"".

Hundreds honour murdered doctor at city vigil,"This video can not be played Hundreds gathered outside the National Museum Cardiff to honour Dr Gary Jenkins Hundreds of people have joined a vigil to remember a doctor murdered in a homophobic attack in a Cardiff park. Three people were convicted of killingDr Gary Jenkinsafter they attacked him in Bute Park on 20 July. Following the trial,LGBTQ+ community members spoke outabout the abuse they say remains prevalent today. The organisers of Sunday evening's vigil outside National Museum Cardiff said they hoped it would show a united stand against intolerance. Vigil held for woman killed while out running Homophobic abuse all too common, MP says LGBT tolerance 'going backwards' as hate crimes up Dr Gary Jenkins died 16 days after the attack last July Dr Jenkins, 54, had been married and had two daughters. He separated from his wife and was openly bisexual when he moved back to his home city of Cardiff about six years ago, the trial of his killers at Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court was told. Lee Strickland, 36, Jason Edwards, 25, and Dionne Timms-Williams, 17, all admitted manslaughter, but were convicted of murder. A tribute left on the steps of National Museum Cardiff The vigil included a minute's silence, and gave people a chance to share their memories of Dr Jenkins at the site near the park. A silence was also observed at other venues around the city. Yan White says abuse towards the LGBTQ+ community is still present in today's society ""This evening is a moment for people to come together to pay respects and reflect on Dr Gary Jenkins' life,"" said one of the organisers, Yan White. ""We're hoping that we will get people who knew Gary who feel comfortable enough to come up and share things about him because he sounds like a really larger than life character who sounds really amazing."" Mr White said, as a member of the LGBTQ+ community, he has heard ""stories of physical and verbal abuse week on week"". ""It's not something that has gone away in society and I think a lot of people think that because there's rainbows everywhere in June that maybe it's fine,"" he said. ""But we are far from that and society has really got a long way to go."" Sian Erasmus, from Cardiff, says it is not only women who are unsafe, but men too For Sian Erasmus, the death of Dr Jenkins made her realise how ""men are not safe either"". Women's safety was particularly brought into the spotlight after theabduction and murder of Sarah Everardand thekilling of Ashling Murphy. She said: ""There's been such a big campaign about keeping our women safe but our men are not safe either. ""It's a stone throw from here and a man has lost his life. It's not right."" Will Hallam, who was a colleague of Dr Jenkins, said: ""I worked with him at Llandough Hospital in the psychiatric unit. ""He was a lovely guy, full of life, a spot on guy. I just think it's really important to mark things like this. I got quite emotional really - it's good that people are coming out and paying their respects."" Sarah Jones, vicar of St John's church in the city centre, who spoke at the vigil, said: ""I moved to Cardiff about three years ago and I absolutely adore it, it's a beautiful city. ""But what's become clear is there is a small element of an underbelly. And a lot of the LGBT community do feel a bit fearful at times. ""I think this has brought us together and maybe it's just something that's under the surface a bit. Hopefully people can treat it as a wake-up call."" At the end of the event, the organisers said they had received a message from Dr Jenkins' family to say ""thank you to everyone for coming out and for showing solidarity"".

Whole villages swept away by Madagascar cyclone,"This video can not be played Whole villages swept away in Madagascar At least 10 people have been killed and nearly 50,000 displaced after Cyclone Batsirai brought strong winds and rain to Madagascar on Saturday evening. Batsirai - the second major storm in two weeks - made landfall on the east coast, with gusts of 235km/h (146mph) and high waves hitting coastal areas. Whole villages are reported to be almost completely destroyed. The cyclone has now weakened, according to the national weather service. Madagascar was already reeling from Tropical Storm Ana, which killed 55 people when it hit the Indian Ocean island nation last month. Cyclone Batsirai has compounded the destruction, making landfall near the south-eastern city of Mananjary, 530km from the capital Antananarivo, at around 20:00 (17:00 GMT) on Saturday. Electricity had not been available in Mananjary for two days and the water supply had been disrupted, according to local media. One resident told Reuters that even schools and churches due to be used as evacuation centres had had their roofs torn off. In other places, the destruction was nearly total. ""It's as if we had just been bombed. The city of Nosy Varika is almost 95% destroyed. The solid houses saw their roofs torn off by the wind. The wooden huts have, for the most part, been destroyed,"" Willy Raharijaona, an adviser to the vice president of Madagascar's Senate, told Reuters news agency. Environment Minister Vahinala Raharinirina told the BBC that many villages were nearly completely gone, with some being swept away by the storm. In the east coast city of Mahanoro, the rising sea eroded a sandy hill which was part of a graveyard. Marie Viviane Rasoanandrasana, a 54-year-old widow, sat and watched as the bodies of her husband, father-in-law and daughter were exposed. ""We've already had damages at home because of the cyclone. Now this,"" she told AFP news agency. Around 48,000 people have been displaced, according to the disaster management agency, although the UN World Food Programme (WFP) estimated that as many as 150,000 people could be forced to leave their homes. Some of the displaced were moved to evacuation centres where victims of January's Tropical Storm Ana were also staying. This video can not be played Stav Danaos has the latest as Cyclone Batsirai makes landfall in Madagascar While the cyclone weakened as it moved inland, with the strongest gusts scaling back to around 110km/h, the country's meteorological agency said that the storm would cause ""significant and widespread damage"". Experts fear that Cyclone Batsirai could prove to be even more destructive than Storm Ana, which also hit Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe, and officials have called on the international community to offer assistance. The WFP has prepared food stocks to distribute to those in need, while some people have already been evacuated. The UN has put rescue aircraft on standby. The cyclone is expected to move westwards and emerge at sea in the Mozambique Channel later on Sunday but is then forecast to head south, avoiding mainland Africa. Evacuation shelters are now providing for those displaced by Cyclone Batsirai and Storm Ana The WFP says the recent pattern of destructive storms caused by global warming and climate change has caused failed harvests, high food prices and increased food insecurity in the region. ""The people of Southern Africa have been on the front lines of climate extremes for many years now and each passing storm sets them back, resetting the progress made,"" said senior WFP official Margaret Malu. Experts say that extreme weather events like cyclones will become more frequent because of climate change. Madagascar is also just recovering from the effects of a drought, which was also blamed on global warming. The environment minister told the BBC that the country had submitted a plan to the COP26 climate conference, which showed it needed $1bn (Â£740m) a year to adapt to the effects of climate change.

'Lives could be lost' due to energy prices hike,"This video can not be played Energy Secretary Michael Matheson says lives could be lost in energy crisis The Scottish government's energy secretary has said there is a ""real risk that lives could be lost"" as a result of the hike in energy prices. Michael Matheson told theBBC's The Sunday Showthat the action proposed by the UK government was wholly inadequate to deal with the scale of the financial crisis facing many households. The average energy bill is set to increase by Â£693 a year from April. UK Energy Minister Greg Hands said the UK government was providing support. The Bank of England has issued a warning that rising prices meant the UK was about to endure the biggest fall in living standards since comparable records began three decades ago. It comes as inflation is on course to rise above 7% this year, leaving households facing the biggest income squeeze in decades. Cost-of-living crisis plan to be outlined next week Rishi Sunak: Energy bill help 'worth Â£290m to Scotland' Most homes to get energy bill discount of Â£350 Extra cash for Scottish councils in bid to avoid tax hikes The Scottish government will receive about Â£290m through Barnett consequentials after Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced a council tax cut in England. The UK chancellor announced the measures to help households after regulator Ofgem raised the energy price cap. Nicola Sturgeon has already told MSPs that""every penny"" of the Â£290m will go towards helping ease the cost-of-living crisis. But on The Sunday Show, Mr Matheson said this was ""insufficient"" to deal with the scale and nature of the crisis being faced by those on low incomes and called for further action from the UK government to help struggling families. He said the 54% rise in the average energy bill would be compounded by the increase in National Insurance contributions and the cut in universal credit. ""There is a real crisis building here,"" he said. ""It has been on the cards for some time now and action from the UK government is wholly inadequate to deal with it sufficiently. ""There is the real risk that lives will be lost this year."" Audrey Flanagan, who helps run a foodbank, believes people will die as a result of the increased costs The programme earlier heard from Audrey Flanagan, from Glasgow South East Foodbank, who said she was seriously concerned about those on low incomes. ""Not only will it be heat or eat but actually we will see people die and, believe me, I don't use that term lightly,"" she said. ""I sat in tears watching what was happening because you can just see the rollout of this. I am gobsmacked, absolutely gobsmacked."" Mr Matheson also said aÂ£200 discount the UK government had announced on energy billsfor homes in Scotland, England and Wales should be a grant instead of a loan. The discount will be automatically recovered from people's bills in equal Â£40 instalments over a five-year period from 2023, when it is hoped global wholesale gas prices will have come down. The energy secretary said: ""There is a very serious risk that if fuel prices stay high over the course of the next couple of years, and that could be the case, it could actually end up forcing more homes into poverty because households are not only having to face high fuel prices but they are also having to face paying back the loan."" He also said the warm homes scheme - which offers those in receipt of certain benefits the option to apply for a one-off Â£140 payment - should be expanded. Mr Matheson highlighted the Scottish government's winter funding package - about Â£41m to help families experiencing difficulty during the winter months - and a specific payment within that to help with fuel costs, particularly helping those on pre-payment meters. Last week, the Scottish government also gave local government an extra Â£120m next year in a bid to ward off big increases in council tax bills. Finance Secretary Kate Forbes said she now had some ""additional flexibility"" due to funding from the UK government. Mr Matheson said fuel poverty was estimated to increase by more than 200,000 homes to almost 900,000 and added that some of those homes would be facing extreme fuel poverty. This video can not be played Energy minister Greg Hands says âa lot is being doneâ to tackle rising prices UK government energy minister Greg Hands told the programme the UK government was already bringing in a number of measures to support those on low incomes. He said: ""We totally recognise the difficulties that many households will be facing with a rise in prices,"" he said. ""In terms of gas and energy prices, those are global prices but we are doing a lot to make sure households are in a better position."" He claimed there were some things that benefited Scotland, including its geography. ""Being closer to the sources of power generation make bills, in some cases, cheaper,"" he said. ""The transmission costs of that energy, for example from renewables - offshore wind in Scotland - will be lower for Scottish consumers than they would for consumers in the south of England."" He said the UK government needed to balance support with fiscal responsibility as it had to spend billions of pounds supporting the economy during the pandemic. He said the Â£200 loan, available from October, was designed to assist people into next winter and would be ""clawed back"" over a five-year period. He added that the national living wage had been increased and that there were ""a lot of important, positive changes coming in"".

When did Elizabeth realise she would one day be Queen?,"The young princess Elizabeth, far right, with her little sister Margaret, and her parents when they were Duke and Duchess of York It is often said that Queen Elizabeth II lived out the first decade of her life with little expectation of her royal destiny. She was a carefree child, apparently, who spent her time playing with her horses and dogs, blessedly free from the shadow of what lay ahead. This Sunday marks the 70th anniversary of her becoming Queen. The young Princess Elizabeth has been compared to the modern-day Princess Beatrice - daughter of the second-ranking Duke of York ('Bertie' in 1926, Prince Andrew today), and hence remote from any serious prospect of succeeding to the British Crown, let alone reigning over the 500 million or so inhabitants of what was then known as the British Commonwealth and Empire. December 1936 thus became the dramatic turning point in this scenario when her Uncle David, King Edward VIII, stunned the world and his family by abdicating the throne to marry Wallis Simpson, his divorcÃ©e American mistress - throwing the 10-year-old Elizabeth into the direct line of succession. Her father Prince Albert took the title of King George VI, and his elder daughter now became his immediate heir - the very first in line. Baby Princess Elizabeth with her grandmother Queen Mary in 1926 But was the young princess really so unprepared? ""Papa is to be King,"" Elizabeth informed her six-year-old sister Margaret Rose that December day, explaining the sudden cheering from the crowds that were gathering outside their town house in Piccadilly. ""Does that mean you're going to be Queen?"" asked Margaret. ""Yes,"" replied Elizabeth coolly, ""I suppose it does."" ""Poor you!"" responded her younger sister humorously as she related the incident to Elizabeth Longford in the early 1980s. But Margaret chose to omit the joke when she re-told the tale two decades later to historian Ben Pimlott. She focused rather on how the new heir had seemed disinclined to jest or dwell upon her dramatic elevation. ""She didn't mention it again,"" the princess told Pimlott. So what did the 10-year-old Princess Elizabeth know? And when did she know it? Queen Elizabeth II's first model for what became her destiny was her beloved grandfather, the bluff and bearded King George V (1865-1936). She called him ""Grandpa England"", which showed how astutely the little girl already grasped the essence of the royal business. George V was distinguished ""by no exercise of social gifts, by no personal magnetism, by no intellectual powers,"" admitted his official biographer John Gore. ""He was neither a wit nor a brilliant raconteur."" The old king, in other words, was exactly like most of his subjects. But he had a sharp sense for survival - and also for symbolism. It was George V who shrewdly jettisoned the royal family's Germanic surname of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha in 1917. So it is hardly surprising that, more than a century later, the world should be in such admiration of the skills that Queen has deployed through her uniquely long and distinguished reign. She learned them first-hand from the House of Windsor's founder. Sea-loving George V was the source of his granddaughter's famous family nickname 'Lilibet'. In April 1929, on her third birthday, she made it to the cover of TIME magazine as 'P'incess Lilybet'. Her grandfather's preferred spelling, however, was 'Lilibet' without the 'y', as set out in frequent fond references in his meticulously maintained diary  - one of the delights of the Royal Archives at Windsor. That spring of 1929 the old king insisted that his beloved granddaughter, just three, be brought down to see him at Bognor Regis on the Sussex coast as one of two crucial ingredients to his recovery from a near-fatal lung operation (the second was that ""he might be allowed to smoke a cigarette""). It was in these early months of 1929 that George V first shared his hopes that his granddaughter would one day ascend to the British throne. 'You'll see,' he told Lilibet's father, who was visiting him during his convalescence, ""your brother will never become King."" ""I remember we thought 'how ridiculous'. . ."" the Queen Mother recalled in later years. ""We both looked at each other and thought 'nonsense'."" But the old king was adamant. ""He will abdicate,"" he insisted to one of his associates  - with extraordinary prescience, considering this was seven years before the event. George V was concerned not only that his eldest son David would sabotage his own reign when he inherited, but also that next-in-line Bertie, himself frail and suffering from lung congestion, would not last the course either. The old monarch apparently worried that the stuttering Duke of York could collapse under the strain of royal responsibility, so little Lilibet might be thrust upon the throne as a child. In that event, the logical Regent was likely to be George V's stolid third son Henry, Duke of Gloucester (1900-1974). The possibility of a still-juvenile Elizabeth ascending the throne under the tutelage of her Uncle Henry may simply have reflected the fretting of an ailing king. But staying at Balmoral the previous autumn, Winston Churchill, then Chancellor of the Exchequer (and later the Queen's first prime minister) seemed to endorse the idea that the child might be a future Queen. The young princess, he wrote to his wife Clementine, ""is a character. She has an air of authority and reflectiveness astonishing in an infant"". Artist CE Turner captured this image of the young princess with her grandfather King George in Bognor Regis in 1929 As she built sandcastles with her slowly recuperating grandfather, the child had evidently absorbed some royal gravitas from the King Emperor. Before the reign of George V came to an end in 1936, the extraordinary expansion of unsolicited public gifts to his granddaughter - and even requests for the presence of the child at public functions - had reached such a volume that a lady-in-waiting had to be engaged to take care of the affairs of young Elizabeth of York. At Windsor Castle in the late 1920s, the young Princess Elizabeth (born 21 April 1926) was observed by the Royal Librarian Owen Morshead being wheeled out in her pram to watch the Changing of the Guard, when the officer commanding would march up to salute her smartly. ""Permission to march off, please, Ma'am?"" Sitting up in her pram, the princess would incline her bonneted head, according to Morshead, then wave her hand to give permission. At this tender age the little girl who already grasped the weightiness of her grandfather's national role as ""Grandpa England"", was clearly developing some inkling of her own as well... What effect does it have on a three-year-old mind to discover that you only have to wave your hand and nod your head for the band to strike up and the entire platoon to march off at your behest - especially as further signals of your grandeur multiply? Young Princess Elizabeth on a six cent stamp from Newfoundland in 1932 Soon after her fourth birthday, in the summer of 1930, a waxen effigy of Princess Elizabeth made its debut at Madame Tussauds, seated on a pony. Two years later the princess was featured on a six-cent stamp in Newfoundland - and down near the South Pole the Union Jack was raised over the 350,000 square miles of ""Princess Elizabeth Land"", claimed by Australia (and a full 100,000 square miles larger than the entire United Kingdom). ""Every time she goes out for a drive in the park,' reported the Belfast News Letter in the summer of 1932, people recognised the six-year-old. ""Hats are raised and handkerchiefs raised from all quarters."" For her seventh birthday in April 1933, the princess sent out tea party invitations on her own stationery - blue writing paper embossed with a capital ""E"" below a royal crown. A crown! A portrait of the young princess in 1933 by artist Philip de LÃ¡szlÃ³ Her parents commissioned society artist Philip de LÃ¡szlÃ³ to paint a chocolate-box portrait of their daughter, whom the painter described as ""a most intelligent and beautiful little girl... she is enormously popular and... at present looked upon as the future Queen of Great Britain."" This striking news was echoed by a well-informed US report in May 1934 that the future Edward VIII was known to be ""lukewarm towards the job for which he was born. Close associates of the Prince have whispered that he does not look forward to being a king with any measure of joy"". As a result, the child princess was now receiving ""the strict education of one who is regarded as in direct succession to the crown of England"". The likely source of these North American revelations - which were studiously ignored by Britain's still-deferential press - was the princess's recently recruited young governess Marion Crawford, who was described as ""very pretty"", ""very dour"" and ""very Scotch"". Instantly nicknamed ""Crawfie"" by her young charges, the governess would become notorious for her best-selling revelations about the upbringing of ""The Little Princesses"" - in which she disclosed, for example, how she conspired with Queen Mary to subvert their mother's wish that her daughters should spend less time inside the schoolroom. A story published in the Marysville Journal-Tribune in 1934 - more than two years before the Abdication (the captions got the names of the royal brothers the wrong way round) Governess and grandmother worked together to inject more rigour into the sisters' education. The severe royal matriarch felt that Princess Elizabeth should only read ""the best type of children's books,"" often selecting them herself - while also dreaming up ""instructive amusements"" for the future monarch, like visits to the Tower of London. ""It would have been impossible for anyone so devoted to the monarchy as Queen Mary,"" recalled her friend the Countess of Airlie, ""to lose sight of the future Queen in this favourite grandchild."" Grandpa England, meanwhile, set more simple targets. ""For goodness' sake,"" he boomed at the governess, ""teach Margaret and Lilibet to write a decent hand - that's all I ask you! None of my children could write properly. They all do it exactly the same way. I like a hand with some character in it."" Foreign newspapers noted how the young princess's chances of becoming ""Queen-Regnant"" were now better than had been those of the eight-year-old Queen Victoria a century earlier - the daughter of a fourth son with two uncles ahead of her. Small wonder that these grand expectations should not rub off on the alert and knowing Elizabeth. ""If I am ever Queen,"" she told Crawfie, ""I shall make a law that there must be no riding on Sundays. Horses should have a rest, too."" Queen Mary sensed the danger. Noticing how her granddaughter was wriggling impatiently on one excursion at a concert, the Queen asked if she would not prefer to go home. ""Oh no, Granny,"" came the reply, ""we can't leave before the end. Think of all the people who'll be waiting to see us outside"" - whereupon Granny immediately instructed a lady-in-waiting to escort the child out by the back way and take her home in a taxi. Queen Mary did not want her elder granddaughter getting addicted to adulation. The Queen and her husband understood how modesty, humility and a sense of service constituted the price that royals had to pay for their grandeur in a democratic age. Duty was their watchword, and they both passed this crucial lesson on to their granddaughter - that she was less important than the system. They made sure Lilibet grew up a team player. Prince William is said to have wanted his son Prince George to enjoy a few years of relative normality before being told his future From all the signs and signals, it does seem likely that the future Elizabeth II had acquired a realistic idea of what lay ahead for her by the age of seven - at least three years before the abdication. Interestingly, the age of seven was when Prince William is said to have revealed the same challenging reality to his son George - at the latest moment before the boy was likely to be confronted with the truth in his London school playground. Like Charles, his father, William has voiced mixed feelings at being saddled with knowing his regal destiny from his earliest awareness. He wanted George to enjoy just a few years of relative normality - and maybe that instinct for the normal is what the Queen's early succession-free years granted her. She might have been elevated to the role of captain, but she never forgot she had started as a player in the team. Coming to the throne in 1952, the Queen would preside over a reign of two halves - relatively humdrum and even drab for nearly three decades, before crackling into life-on-the-edge with the troubled 1980s marriage of Charles to Diana, the gift that kept on giving to the voracious late-century media. This was when the childhood lessons the young Elizabeth had absorbed from her grandparents came into play. The Queen needed all the steady humility she could muster to withstand the avalanche of abdication-like tremors: Charles, Diana, Camilla, the Windsor fire, Andrew-with-Fergie, Andrew-without-Fergie - with the unexpected tweak-in-the-tail delivered by the departure to the US of grandson Harry in 2020. It was one crisis after another - and through it all, the monarchy prevailed in her safe hands. A dry sense of humour helped. In 1992 the Queen disarmed the disaster of the Windsor Fire and the breakdown of three of her children's marriages by resorting to some facetious dog Latin - 1992 had been her ""Annus Horribilis"", she explained with a smile. ""Oh dear,"" she enquired when an embarrassed Labour minister Clare Short had to stop her mobile phone from ringing during a Privy Council meeting. ""I hope it wasn't anyone important?"" From an early age the sharp-eyed and sharp-thinking Queen Elizabeth II seems to have grasped the comedy of the royal show in which she would be destined to play a leading role. ""Let us not take ourselves too seriously,"" she declared in her Christmas broadcast for 1991. ""None of us has a monopoly on wisdom."" The young princesses Elizabeth and Margaret with their parents and dogs at Windsor in 1936 In 1933, according to royal legend, Lilibet confidently informed her sister Margaret, born in 1930, ""I'm three and you're four."" Young and confused, but still able to do the sums, Margaret responded: ""No, you're not. I'm three, you're seven!"" It took time to dawn on Margaret that her elder sister was not talking about age. She was referring to the two girls' respective positions in the order of succession after their grandfather - Uncle David, one; Papa, two; and Lilibet, three. The seven-year-old was right up to speed with what the rest of the world was starting to think. After the abdication and having been moved up two rankings to face the challenge of being number one in the line of succession, the 10-year-old princess was described by her grandmother Lady Strathmore as ""ardently praying for a brother"". But there was no baby brother coming to the rescue. The little girl raised among her horses and dogs now had to prepare herself for the challenge of eventually becoming ""Grandma England"" - and ""Grandma"" of Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland too.

"Worst to come for food price rises - TescoBoss John Allan says costs will rise further and the plight of people on low incomes ""troubles us"".Business","John Allan said the cost of living squeeze will hit the ""hardest-up still harder"". The chairman of Britain's biggest supermarket has warned ""the worst is yet to come"" on rising food prices. Tesco's John Allan told the BBC he was aware people were on very tight budgets and having to choose between food and heating ""troubles us"". But he said grocers and suppliers were not immune from rising energy costs. Mr Allan also defended Tesco against claims from food poverty activist Jack Monroe that the costs of basic staples were rising faster than other goods. He estimated supermarket prices could rise as much as 5% by the spring as energy and other costs feed through to the High Street, adding that Tesco's food price inflation in the last three months had been contained to about 1%. ""We are impacted by rising energy prices, our suppliers are impacted by rising energy prices. So the likelihood is that that inflation figure will rise,"" he said. Mr Allan said he recognised the cost of food took up a bigger proportion of household budgets for people on lower incomes. People having to choose between heating their homes and feeding their families ""troubles us, and I'm sure troubles many people... That's clearly not a situation that any of us should tolerate,"" he said. A report earlier this month from the British Retail Consortium said food inflation accelerated to 2.7% in January, up from 2.4% in December. Why are prices rising so quickly? Fury after Bank boss says don't ask for big pay rise Jack Monroe hails inflation-measure shake-up Annual UK inflation is currently 5.4%, a 30-year high, and is predicted to top 7% this year. Meanwhile, the cost of energy is set to soar under new price-cap rules, prompting the chancellor to unveil a support package for households last week. Mr Allan said: ""I think the combination of increasing energy prices, the impact of National Insurance increases [in April] on people's incomes, and to a much much lesser extent increasing food prices, is going to squeeze the hardest-up still harder."" The pressure facing poorer households was highlighted by Jack Monroe this month in analysis she said showed that everyday essentials, such as the cheapest own-brand pasta or rice, were going up in price by more than the official inflation rate. Mr Allan said he could not speak for the rest of the industry, but it was untrue at Tesco. ""Price rises depend on individual products - coffee is going up, but other things like the cheapest tin of baked beans in Tesco is cheaper than it was five years ago,"" he said. ""As far as Tesco is concerned, we have 2,100 products on our lowest price. We're either price matching against Aldi, or it's our own exclusive at Tesco range. That number [of products] has been increasing in recent months rather than decreasing, so it's not true,"" Mr Allan said. Sainsbury's declined to comment on whether it also expects price rises to accelerate. But it told the BBC it was ""investing in value more than ever"" to help customers manage the rising cost of living. The BBC has also contacted Morrisons, M&S and Asda for comment. The head of the retail industry's trade body said that across the sector firms are working hard to cut costs. But there is only so much the industry can do to shield shoppers, said Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium. ""It would be impossible to protect consumers from any future rises. As commodity prices, energy prices and transportation costs continue to rise, it is inevitable that retail prices will continue to follow in the future,"" she said. Meanwhile, Mr Allan also rejected suggestions from the Bank of England's governor that people should not ask for big pay rises because it was feeding into higher inflation. Andrew Bailey's comments to the BBC were branded a ""sick joke"" by the GMB union, while the TUC said the call was ""ill-founded"". Tesco is the UK's largest private sector employer, with about 300,000 staff. Asked if the company would be telling employees to follow Mr Bailey's advice, Mr Allan said ""no, absolutely not. I think that's the wrong direction for people to go in,"" he said. ""We are not telling people not to take a pay rise. We think our colleagues deserve pay rises,"" Mr Allan said. ""We have given 5-6% raises to our distribution colleagues, and we're in the midst of negotiations, which will probably lead to a similar result for our store colleagues.""

Hundreds honour murdered doctor at city vigilOrganisers want the gathering to show unity against intolerance after the homophobic killing.,"This video can not be played Hundreds gathered outside the National Museum Cardiff to honour Dr Gary Jenkins Hundreds of people have joined a vigil to remember a doctor murdered in a homophobic attack in a Cardiff park. Three people were convicted of killingDr Gary Jenkinsafter they attacked him in Bute Park on 20 July. Following the trial,LGBTQ+ community members spoke outabout the abuse they say remains prevalent today. The organisers of Sunday evening's vigil outside National Museum Cardiff said they hoped it would show a united stand against intolerance. Vigil held for woman killed while out running Homophobic abuse all too common, MP says LGBT tolerance 'going backwards' as hate crimes up Dr Gary Jenkins died 16 days after the attack last July Dr Jenkins, 54, had been married and had two daughters. He separated from his wife and was openly bisexual when he moved back to his home city of Cardiff about six years ago, the trial of his killers at Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court was told. Lee Strickland, 36, Jason Edwards, 25, and Dionne Timms-Williams, 17, all admitted manslaughter, but were convicted of murder. A tribute left on the steps of National Museum Cardiff The vigil included a minute's silence, and gave people a chance to share their memories of Dr Jenkins at the site near the park. A silence was also observed at other venues around the city. Yan White says abuse towards the LGBTQ+ community is still present in today's society ""This evening is a moment for people to come together to pay respects and reflect on Dr Gary Jenkins' life,"" said one of the organisers, Yan White. ""We're hoping that we will get people who knew Gary who feel comfortable enough to come up and share things about him because he sounds like a really larger than life character who sounds really amazing."" Mr White said, as a member of the LGBTQ+ community, he has heard ""stories of physical and verbal abuse week on week"". ""It's not something that has gone away in society and I think a lot of people think that because there's rainbows everywhere in June that maybe it's fine,"" he said. ""But we are far from that and society has really got a long way to go."" Sian Erasmus, from Cardiff, says it is not only women who are unsafe, but men too For Sian Erasmus, the death of Dr Jenkins made her realise how ""men are not safe either"". Women's safety was particularly brought into the spotlight after theabduction and murder of Sarah Everardand thekilling of Ashling Murphy. She said: ""There's been such a big campaign about keeping our women safe but our men are not safe either. ""It's a stone throw from here and a man has lost his life. It's not right."" Will Hallam, who was a colleague of Dr Jenkins, said: ""I worked with him at Llandough Hospital in the psychiatric unit. ""He was a lovely guy, full of life, a spot on guy. I just think it's really important to mark things like this. I got quite emotional really - it's good that people are coming out and paying their respects."" Sarah Jones, vicar of St John's church in the city centre, who spoke at the vigil, said: ""I moved to Cardiff about three years ago and I absolutely adore it, it's a beautiful city. ""But what's become clear is there is a small element of an underbelly. And a lot of the LGBT community do feel a bit fearful at times. ""I think this has brought us together and maybe it's just something that's under the surface a bit. Hopefully people can treat it as a wake-up call."" At the end of the event, the organisers said they had received a message from Dr Jenkins' family to say ""thank you to everyone for coming out and for showing solidarity"".

"Whole villages swept away by Madagascar cycloneAt least six people die and 50,000 are displaced as Cyclone Batsirai brings widespread destruction.Africa","This video can not be played Whole villages swept away in Madagascar At least 10 people have been killed and nearly 50,000 displaced after Cyclone Batsirai brought strong winds and rain to Madagascar on Saturday evening. Batsirai - the second major storm in two weeks - made landfall on the east coast, with gusts of 235km/h (146mph) and high waves hitting coastal areas. Whole villages are reported to be almost completely destroyed. The cyclone has now weakened, according to the national weather service. Madagascar was already reeling from Tropical Storm Ana, which killed 55 people when it hit the Indian Ocean island nation last month. Cyclone Batsirai has compounded the destruction, making landfall near the south-eastern city of Mananjary, 530km from the capital Antananarivo, at around 20:00 (17:00 GMT) on Saturday. Electricity had not been available in Mananjary for two days and the water supply had been disrupted, according to local media. One resident told Reuters that even schools and churches due to be used as evacuation centres had had their roofs torn off. In other places, the destruction was nearly total. ""It's as if we had just been bombed. The city of Nosy Varika is almost 95% destroyed. The solid houses saw their roofs torn off by the wind. The wooden huts have, for the most part, been destroyed,"" Willy Raharijaona, an adviser to the vice president of Madagascar's Senate, told Reuters news agency. Environment Minister Vahinala Raharinirina told the BBC that many villages were nearly completely gone, with some being swept away by the storm. In the east coast city of Mahanoro, the rising sea eroded a sandy hill which was part of a graveyard. Marie Viviane Rasoanandrasana, a 54-year-old widow, sat and watched as the bodies of her husband, father-in-law and daughter were exposed. ""We've already had damages at home because of the cyclone. Now this,"" she told AFP news agency. Around 48,000 people have been displaced, according to the disaster management agency, although the UN World Food Programme (WFP) estimated that as many as 150,000 people could be forced to leave their homes. Some of the displaced were moved to evacuation centres where victims of January's Tropical Storm Ana were also staying. This video can not be played Stav Danaos has the latest as Cyclone Batsirai makes landfall in Madagascar While the cyclone weakened as it moved inland, with the strongest gusts scaling back to around 110km/h, the country's meteorological agency said that the storm would cause ""significant and widespread damage"". Experts fear that Cyclone Batsirai could prove to be even more destructive than Storm Ana, which also hit Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe, and officials have called on the international community to offer assistance. The WFP has prepared food stocks to distribute to those in need, while some people have already been evacuated. The UN has put rescue aircraft on standby. The cyclone is expected to move westwards and emerge at sea in the Mozambique Channel later on Sunday but is then forecast to head south, avoiding mainland Africa. Evacuation shelters are now providing for those displaced by Cyclone Batsirai and Storm Ana The WFP says the recent pattern of destructive storms caused by global warming and climate change has caused failed harvests, high food prices and increased food insecurity in the region. ""The people of Southern Africa have been on the front lines of climate extremes for many years now and each passing storm sets them back, resetting the progress made,"" said senior WFP official Margaret Malu. Experts say that extreme weather events like cyclones will become more frequent because of climate change. Madagascar is also just recovering from the effects of a drought, which was also blamed on global warming. The environment minister told the BBC that the country had submitted a plan to the COP26 climate conference, which showed it needed $1bn (Â£740m) a year to adapt to the effects of climate change.

"'I just felt trapped, like I can't even move'","Bethany began isolating at the end of last year at Muckamore Abbey Hospital when some of her family tested positive for Covid-19 ""When I first found out I was a close contact of someone with Covid-19, I knew straight away that isolating would be a struggle."" Bethany Menary is a patient at Muckamore Abbey Hospital in County Antrim, which cares for adults with learning disabilities. Like many during the pandemic, the 20 year old was forced to isolate at the end of last year after some of her family members tested positive for coronavirus. She missed the craic, the company of others and all her daily activities, like swimming and badminton. Her life had been turned upside down, so she turned to blogging, as a way to document the highs and lows. Beginning her quarantine, a fearful Bethany wrote: ""Routine is very important to me. ""If my routine is broken or interrupted, I find it extremely difficult."" Speaking to BBC News NI, Bethany said the break in her routine triggered her anxiety. ""At the start I was literally laying in bed, sitting in my chair and watching YouTube every day,"" she said. ""I had such little to do."" Bethany says the break in her routine was one of the biggest struggles during isolation Sociable by nature, she found it difficult having to keep her distance from staff and other patients. But she was determined to write down her experiences, in the hope it would give people with learning disabilities a voice, particularly those struggling during the pandemic, like her. ""I do think sometimes people think when you have a learning disability that you're not capable of doing something,"" she said. ""Well, I actually can do things and I wanted to show that I can do this [blog]. ""It's important people with learning disabilities have the same equal opportunities as other people because we can do loads of things that other people can."" People with learning disabilities 'living a nightmare' In the first few days of isolation, she really struggled, as she awaited the results of a PCR test. She shares a living space with another patient, so they had to be in separate rooms at all times. ""It was difficult, I had to wait until she got into her living area before I could actually go up the corridor,"" she said. ""I just felt trapped, like I can't even move."" But Bethany said the biggest challenge of all was not being able to see her loved ones. ""I got to speak to my family but it was just over Facetime and WhatsApp or ringing them,"" she said. ""Not being able to go home and see my three brothers, two sisters and my mummy was just so hard. ""I know it was in everyone's best interest but I just wanted to go home."" After a couple of days, things started to look up for Bethany after she received a negative PCR result. She still had to isolate at the hospital and remain socially distanced from other patients, but could start taking part in some ward-based activities. Art classes in their usual form were on hold but the resident artist, Frank, left some paints for Bethany so she could work on her own projects. Bethany decided to give her wheelchair a makeover. Bethany also took part in virtual meetings with Telling It Like It Is (TILI), an advocacy group for people with learning disabilities. In her blog, Bethany said taking part in the Zoom sessions were ""very important"" to her. They allowed her to work on a safeguarding initiative while she was in isolation. ""We speak up for people who may not have the capacity and ability to do it themselves, we make sure their voices are heard,"" Bethany said. ""People with learning disabilities can often find it hard to read and process a lot of information, so we put stuff into an easy read format with pictures. ""That is my favourite thing to do for TILI."" While much of Bethany's blog documents the difficulties she faced during her isolation, she also makes clear how much the staff helped her during this time. She said on top of the ward-based day care, staff took Bethany outside for walks around the hospital grounds and got her favourite food. ""I would ring with my order and then the cafÃ© staff would leave my food outside the eating area; staff would take me across and collect it for me,"" she wrote. ""It is not easy isolating, but all the staff helped me through it. ""It can be quite lonely sometimes and it did affect how I felt about myself and my confidence - it [isolation] knocked me a bit mentally. ""I was frustrated having no routine because I couldn't do things I normally do."" But she said the blog also helped her process her anxiety and feelings of frustration. ""I think writing and typing helps me express how I feel because I'm actually being honest with how I feel,"" Bethany said. ""Sometimes when I'm talking I just say 'yeah I'm fine', when I'm actually not. ""I find typing and writing easier than speaking and I would definitely encourage other people to write about it if they're struggling.""

Dazzling Eubank Jr outclasses Williams,"Chris Eubank has only been defeated twice as a professional Chris Eubank Jr produced a dazzling display as he proved a class above Welshman Liam Williams to move closer to a world title shot in 2022. Eubank had Williams on the canvas three times in the opening four rounds as he backed up his pre-fight confidence with arguably a career-best performance. Williams showed tremendous heart and bravery to battle on but was again sent to the canvas in the 11th round. Eubank took a unanimous decision 116-109, 116-108 and 117-109 on the cards. ""I am happy with the performance, I wanted to teach that man a lesson, he said some quite menacing things to me in the lead-up to this fight,"" Eubank said. ""I wanted to punish him. I didn't want to knock him out in one round, I wanted to punish him. ""Headbutts, headlocks, I am surprised he didn't get disqualified. But I took it like a man and I punished him like I said I would. It was a fun night. ""I think I showed some of my critics a different side to me. There was no danger, if I had stepped on the gas at any point in the fight he would have been gone. ""There are levels to this game. Don't be a big mouth against guys you can get hurt against."" This video can not be played Born To Brawl: Chris Eubank Jr tells his story before fight with Liam Williams This was the biggest indoor arena boxing show in Cardiff in over 20 years with the Motorpoint  full to capacity for the first time since the heyday of one of Wales' greatest ever, Joe Calzaghe, who drew the sold out signs for a WBO super middleweight title defence in 2001 against Mario Veit. The atmosphere was electric in the Welsh capital with a live rendition of Delilah pumping the volume up to 11 in the first major boxing show of the year in the UK. Eubank predictably entered the arena to a chorus of boos but seemed to relish his status as the bad guy in Cardiff as he looked calm and relaxed with Williams prowling and snarling throughout the pre-fight introductions. Eubank Jr beats Williams - round by round as it happened Claressa Shields shines in win over Ema Kozin An extremely cautious first round exploded into life when Eubank tagged Williams with a jab that caused the Welshman to lose his footing and take a standing count and things soon went from bad to worse for Williams. His corner were massaging his left leg after the first round, but Eubank again dropped the Welshman in the second round as he produced a left hook that saw Williams' legs buckle as his left leg appeared to completely give way. To his credit Williams again answered the count and he enjoyed an even share of the third round before being rocked by a Eubank shot after the bell that angered his corner. However, Eubank put Williams down again following a slick combination in the fourth as a weary Williams struggled to convince the referee not to wave things off. Williams responded and improved in the middle rounds, but by then faced a mountain to climb on the scorecards. This was a genuine grudge match after much trash talking ahead of the fight, with two fighters who clearly don't like one another meeting to settle their issues, but the stakes were higher than that with the UK's number one and number two-ranked middleweights meeting for the first time. Both combatants knew the winner was almost certain to move onto bigger and better things in 2022 as two fighters who have fallen short on the biggest stage look to make amends with another world title opportunity. Eubank and Williams both had everything to prove having fallen short in their biggest fights to date, but it is Eubank who can now look forward to a potential world title shot later this year. In total control of the contest thanks to his succession of early knockdowns and slipping away from Williams' biggest shots, Eubank taunted Williams throughout and again floored his opponent in the 11th round as Williams appealed in vain that he had slipped. Eubank drew some boos for showboating in the final session, but there was no doubting he was a clear and decisive victor. On the undercard there was some Welsh success as former British and Commonwealth welterweight champion Chris Jenkins returned to action with a comfortable 78-75 points victory over former world champion Julius Indongo, while stablemate Rhys Edwards was also victorious.

Madagascar battered by second storm in two weeks,"This video can not be played Whole villages swept away in Madagascar At least 10 people have been killed and nearly 50,000 displaced after Cyclone Batsirai brought strong winds and rain to Madagascar on Saturday evening. Batsirai - the second major storm in two weeks - made landfall on the east coast, with gusts of 235km/h (146mph) and high waves hitting coastal areas. Whole villages are reported to be almost completely destroyed. The cyclone has now weakened, according to the national weather service. Madagascar was already reeling from Tropical Storm Ana, which killed 55 people when it hit the Indian Ocean island nation last month. Cyclone Batsirai has compounded the destruction, making landfall near the south-eastern city of Mananjary, 530km from the capital Antananarivo, at around 20:00 (17:00 GMT) on Saturday. Electricity had not been available in Mananjary for two days and the water supply had been disrupted, according to local media. One resident told Reuters that even schools and churches due to be used as evacuation centres had had their roofs torn off. In other places, the destruction was nearly total. ""It's as if we had just been bombed. The city of Nosy Varika is almost 95% destroyed. The solid houses saw their roofs torn off by the wind. The wooden huts have, for the most part, been destroyed,"" Willy Raharijaona, an adviser to the vice president of Madagascar's Senate, told Reuters news agency. Environment Minister Vahinala Raharinirina told the BBC that many villages were nearly completely gone, with some being swept away by the storm. In the east coast city of Mahanoro, the rising sea eroded a sandy hill which was part of a graveyard. Marie Viviane Rasoanandrasana, a 54-year-old widow, sat and watched as the bodies of her husband, father-in-law and daughter were exposed. ""We've already had damages at home because of the cyclone. Now this,"" she told AFP news agency. Around 48,000 people have been displaced, according to the disaster management agency, although the UN World Food Programme (WFP) estimated that as many as 150,000 people could be forced to leave their homes. Some of the displaced were moved to evacuation centres where victims of January's Tropical Storm Ana were also staying. This video can not be played Stav Danaos has the latest as Cyclone Batsirai makes landfall in Madagascar While the cyclone weakened as it moved inland, with the strongest gusts scaling back to around 110km/h, the country's meteorological agency said that the storm would cause ""significant and widespread damage"". Experts fear that Cyclone Batsirai could prove to be even more destructive than Storm Ana, which also hit Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe, and officials have called on the international community to offer assistance. The WFP has prepared food stocks to distribute to those in need, while some people have already been evacuated. The UN has put rescue aircraft on standby. The cyclone is expected to move westwards and emerge at sea in the Mozambique Channel later on Sunday but is then forecast to head south, avoiding mainland Africa. Evacuation shelters are now providing for those displaced by Cyclone Batsirai and Storm Ana The WFP says the recent pattern of destructive storms caused by global warming and climate change has caused failed harvests, high food prices and increased food insecurity in the region. ""The people of Southern Africa have been on the front lines of climate extremes for many years now and each passing storm sets them back, resetting the progress made,"" said senior WFP official Margaret Malu. Experts say that extreme weather events like cyclones will become more frequent because of climate change. Madagascar is also just recovering from the effects of a drought, which was also blamed on global warming. The environment minister told the BBC that the country had submitted a plan to the COP26 climate conference, which showed it needed $1bn (Â£740m) a year to adapt to the effects of climate change.

When did young Elizabeth realise she would one day be Queen?,"The young princess Elizabeth, far right, with her little sister Margaret, and her parents when they were Duke and Duchess of York It is often said that Queen Elizabeth II lived out the first decade of her life with little expectation of her royal destiny. She was a carefree child, apparently, who spent her time playing with her horses and dogs, blessedly free from the shadow of what lay ahead. This Sunday marks the 70th anniversary of her becoming Queen. The young Princess Elizabeth has been compared to the modern-day Princess Beatrice - daughter of the second-ranking Duke of York ('Bertie' in 1926, Prince Andrew today), and hence remote from any serious prospect of succeeding to the British Crown, let alone reigning over the 500 million or so inhabitants of what was then known as the British Commonwealth and Empire. December 1936 thus became the dramatic turning point in this scenario when her Uncle David, King Edward VIII, stunned the world and his family by abdicating the throne to marry Wallis Simpson, his divorcÃ©e American mistress - throwing the 10-year-old Elizabeth into the direct line of succession. Her father Prince Albert took the title of King George VI, and his elder daughter now became his immediate heir - the very first in line. Baby Princess Elizabeth with her grandmother Queen Mary in 1926 But was the young princess really so unprepared? ""Papa is to be King,"" Elizabeth informed her six-year-old sister Margaret Rose that December day, explaining the sudden cheering from the crowds that were gathering outside their town house in Piccadilly. ""Does that mean you're going to be Queen?"" asked Margaret. ""Yes,"" replied Elizabeth coolly, ""I suppose it does."" ""Poor you!"" responded her younger sister humorously as she related the incident to Elizabeth Longford in the early 1980s. But Margaret chose to omit the joke when she re-told the tale two decades later to historian Ben Pimlott. She focused rather on how the new heir had seemed disinclined to jest or dwell upon her dramatic elevation. ""She didn't mention it again,"" the princess told Pimlott. So what did the 10-year-old Princess Elizabeth know? And when did she know it? Queen Elizabeth II's first model for what became her destiny was her beloved grandfather, the bluff and bearded King George V (1865-1936). She called him ""Grandpa England"", which showed how astutely the little girl already grasped the essence of the royal business. George V was distinguished ""by no exercise of social gifts, by no personal magnetism, by no intellectual powers,"" admitted his official biographer John Gore. ""He was neither a wit nor a brilliant raconteur."" The old king, in other words, was exactly like most of his subjects. But he had a sharp sense for survival - and also for symbolism. It was George V who shrewdly jettisoned the royal family's Germanic surname of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha in 1917. So it is hardly surprising that, more than a century later, the world should be in such admiration of the skills that Queen has deployed through her uniquely long and distinguished reign. She learned them first-hand from the House of Windsor's founder. Sea-loving George V was the source of his granddaughter's famous family nickname 'Lilibet'. In April 1929, on her third birthday, she made it to the cover of TIME magazine as 'P'incess Lilybet'. Her grandfather's preferred spelling, however, was 'Lilibet' without the 'y', as set out in frequent fond references in his meticulously maintained diary  - one of the delights of the Royal Archives at Windsor. That spring of 1929 the old king insisted that his beloved granddaughter, just three, be brought down to see him at Bognor Regis on the Sussex coast as one of two crucial ingredients to his recovery from a near-fatal lung operation (the second was that ""he might be allowed to smoke a cigarette""). It was in these early months of 1929 that George V first shared his hopes that his granddaughter would one day ascend to the British throne. 'You'll see,' he told Lilibet's father, who was visiting him during his convalescence, ""your brother will never become King."" ""I remember we thought 'how ridiculous'. . ."" the Queen Mother recalled in later years. ""We both looked at each other and thought 'nonsense'."" But the old king was adamant. ""He will abdicate,"" he insisted to one of his associates  - with extraordinary prescience, considering this was seven years before the event. George V was concerned not only that his eldest son David would sabotage his own reign when he inherited, but also that next-in-line Bertie, himself frail and suffering from lung congestion, would not last the course either. The old monarch apparently worried that the stuttering Duke of York could collapse under the strain of royal responsibility, so little Lilibet might be thrust upon the throne as a child. In that event, the logical Regent was likely to be George V's stolid third son Henry, Duke of Gloucester (1900-1974). The possibility of a still-juvenile Elizabeth ascending the throne under the tutelage of her Uncle Henry may simply have reflected the fretting of an ailing king. But staying at Balmoral the previous autumn, Winston Churchill, then Chancellor of the Exchequer (and later the Queen's first prime minister) seemed to endorse the idea that the child might be a future Queen. The young princess, he wrote to his wife Clementine, ""is a character. She has an air of authority and reflectiveness astonishing in an infant"". Artist CE Turner captured this image of the young princess with her grandfather King George in Bognor Regis in 1929 As she built sandcastles with her slowly recuperating grandfather, the child had evidently absorbed some royal gravitas from the King Emperor. Before the reign of George V came to an end in 1936, the extraordinary expansion of unsolicited public gifts to his granddaughter - and even requests for the presence of the child at public functions - had reached such a volume that a lady-in-waiting had to be engaged to take care of the affairs of young Elizabeth of York. At Windsor Castle in the late 1920s, the young Princess Elizabeth (born 21 April 1926) was observed by the Royal Librarian Owen Morshead being wheeled out in her pram to watch the Changing of the Guard, when the officer commanding would march up to salute her smartly. ""Permission to march off, please, Ma'am?"" Sitting up in her pram, the princess would incline her bonneted head, according to Morshead, then wave her hand to give permission. At this tender age the little girl who already grasped the weightiness of her grandfather's national role as ""Grandpa England"", was clearly developing some inkling of her own as well... What effect does it have on a three-year-old mind to discover that you only have to wave your hand and nod your head for the band to strike up and the entire platoon to march off at your behest - especially as further signals of your grandeur multiply? Young Princess Elizabeth on a six cent stamp from Newfoundland in 1932 Soon after her fourth birthday, in the summer of 1930, a waxen effigy of Princess Elizabeth made its debut at Madame Tussauds, seated on a pony. Two years later the princess was featured on a six-cent stamp in Newfoundland - and down near the South Pole the Union Jack was raised over the 350,000 square miles of ""Princess Elizabeth Land"", claimed by Australia (and a full 100,000 square miles larger than the entire United Kingdom). ""Every time she goes out for a drive in the park,' reported the Belfast News Letter in the summer of 1932, people recognised the six-year-old. ""Hats are raised and handkerchiefs raised from all quarters."" For her seventh birthday in April 1933, the princess sent out tea party invitations on her own stationery - blue writing paper embossed with a capital ""E"" below a royal crown. A crown! A portrait of the young princess in 1933 by artist Philip de LÃ¡szlÃ³ Her parents commissioned society artist Philip de LÃ¡szlÃ³ to paint a chocolate-box portrait of their daughter, whom the painter described as ""a most intelligent and beautiful little girl... she is enormously popular and... at present looked upon as the future Queen of Great Britain."" This striking news was echoed by a well-informed US report in May 1934 that the future Edward VIII was known to be ""lukewarm towards the job for which he was born. Close associates of the Prince have whispered that he does not look forward to being a king with any measure of joy"". As a result, the child princess was now receiving ""the strict education of one who is regarded as in direct succession to the crown of England"". The likely source of these North American revelations - which were studiously ignored by Britain's still-deferential press - was the princess's recently recruited young governess Marion Crawford, who was described as ""very pretty"", ""very dour"" and ""very Scotch"". Instantly nicknamed ""Crawfie"" by her young charges, the governess would become notorious for her best-selling revelations about the upbringing of ""The Little Princesses"" - in which she disclosed, for example, how she conspired with Queen Mary to subvert their mother's wish that her daughters should spend less time inside the schoolroom. A story published in the Marysville Journal-Tribune in 1934 - more than two years before the Abdication (the captions got the names of the royal brothers the wrong way round) Governess and grandmother worked together to inject more rigour into the sisters' education. The severe royal matriarch felt that Princess Elizabeth should only read ""the best type of children's books,"" often selecting them herself - while also dreaming up ""instructive amusements"" for the future monarch, like visits to the Tower of London. ""It would have been impossible for anyone so devoted to the monarchy as Queen Mary,"" recalled her friend the Countess of Airlie, ""to lose sight of the future Queen in this favourite grandchild."" Grandpa England, meanwhile, set more simple targets. ""For goodness' sake,"" he boomed at the governess, ""teach Margaret and Lilibet to write a decent hand - that's all I ask you! None of my children could write properly. They all do it exactly the same way. I like a hand with some character in it."" Foreign newspapers noted how the young princess's chances of becoming ""Queen-Regnant"" were now better than had been those of the eight-year-old Queen Victoria a century earlier - the daughter of a fourth son with two uncles ahead of her. Small wonder that these grand expectations should not rub off on the alert and knowing Elizabeth. ""If I am ever Queen,"" she told Crawfie, ""I shall make a law that there must be no riding on Sundays. Horses should have a rest, too."" Queen Mary sensed the danger. Noticing how her granddaughter was wriggling impatiently on one excursion at a concert, the Queen asked if she would not prefer to go home. ""Oh no, Granny,"" came the reply, ""we can't leave before the end. Think of all the people who'll be waiting to see us outside"" - whereupon Granny immediately instructed a lady-in-waiting to escort the child out by the back way and take her home in a taxi. Queen Mary did not want her elder granddaughter getting addicted to adulation. The Queen and her husband understood how modesty, humility and a sense of service constituted the price that royals had to pay for their grandeur in a democratic age. Duty was their watchword, and they both passed this crucial lesson on to their granddaughter - that she was less important than the system. They made sure Lilibet grew up a team player. Prince William is said to have wanted his son Prince George to enjoy a few years of relative normality before being told his future From all the signs and signals, it does seem likely that the future Elizabeth II had acquired a realistic idea of what lay ahead for her by the age of seven - at least three years before the abdication. Interestingly, the age of seven was when Prince William is said to have revealed the same challenging reality to his son George - at the latest moment before the boy was likely to be confronted with the truth in his London school playground. Like Charles, his father, William has voiced mixed feelings at being saddled with knowing his regal destiny from his earliest awareness. He wanted George to enjoy just a few years of relative normality - and maybe that instinct for the normal is what the Queen's early succession-free years granted her. She might have been elevated to the role of captain, but she never forgot she had started as a player in the team. Coming to the throne in 1952, the Queen would preside over a reign of two halves - relatively humdrum and even drab for nearly three decades, before crackling into life-on-the-edge with the troubled 1980s marriage of Charles to Diana, the gift that kept on giving to the voracious late-century media. This was when the childhood lessons the young Elizabeth had absorbed from her grandparents came into play. The Queen needed all the steady humility she could muster to withstand the avalanche of abdication-like tremors: Charles, Diana, Camilla, the Windsor fire, Andrew-with-Fergie, Andrew-without-Fergie - with the unexpected tweak-in-the-tail delivered by the departure to the US of grandson Harry in 2020. It was one crisis after another - and through it all, the monarchy prevailed in her safe hands. A dry sense of humour helped. In 1992 the Queen disarmed the disaster of the Windsor Fire and the breakdown of three of her children's marriages by resorting to some facetious dog Latin - 1992 had been her ""Annus Horribilis"", she explained with a smile. ""Oh dear,"" she enquired when an embarrassed Labour minister Clare Short had to stop her mobile phone from ringing during a Privy Council meeting. ""I hope it wasn't anyone important?"" From an early age the sharp-eyed and sharp-thinking Queen Elizabeth II seems to have grasped the comedy of the royal show in which she would be destined to play a leading role. ""Let us not take ourselves too seriously,"" she declared in her Christmas broadcast for 1991. ""None of us has a monopoly on wisdom."" The young princesses Elizabeth and Margaret with their parents and dogs at Windsor in 1936 In 1933, according to royal legend, Lilibet confidently informed her sister Margaret, born in 1930, ""I'm three and you're four."" Young and confused, but still able to do the sums, Margaret responded: ""No, you're not. I'm three, you're seven!"" It took time to dawn on Margaret that her elder sister was not talking about age. She was referring to the two girls' respective positions in the order of succession after their grandfather - Uncle David, one; Papa, two; and Lilibet, three. The seven-year-old was right up to speed with what the rest of the world was starting to think. After the abdication and having been moved up two rankings to face the challenge of being number one in the line of succession, the 10-year-old princess was described by her grandmother Lady Strathmore as ""ardently praying for a brother"". But there was no baby brother coming to the rescue. The little girl raised among her horses and dogs now had to prepare herself for the challenge of eventually becoming ""Grandma England"" - and ""Grandma"" of Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland too.

"'Lives could be lost' due to energy prices hikeThe Scottish energy secretary says there is a ""real risk"" that people will die as a result of the increase in costs.Scotland politics","This video can not be played Energy Secretary Michael Matheson says lives could be lost in energy crisis The Scottish government's energy secretary has said there is a ""real risk that lives could be lost"" as a result of the hike in energy prices. Michael Matheson told theBBC's The Sunday Showthat the action proposed by the UK government was wholly inadequate to deal with the scale of the financial crisis facing many households. The average energy bill is set to increase by Â£693 a year from April. UK Energy Minister Greg Hands said the UK government was providing support. The Bank of England has issued a warning that rising prices meant the UK was about to endure the biggest fall in living standards since comparable records began three decades ago. It comes as inflation is on course to rise above 7% this year, leaving households facing the biggest income squeeze in decades. Cost-of-living crisis plan to be outlined next week Rishi Sunak: Energy bill help 'worth Â£290m to Scotland' Most homes to get energy bill discount of Â£350 Extra cash for Scottish councils in bid to avoid tax hikes The Scottish government will receive about Â£290m through Barnett consequentials after Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced a council tax cut in England. The UK chancellor announced the measures to help households after regulator Ofgem raised the energy price cap. Nicola Sturgeon has already told MSPs that""every penny"" of the Â£290m will go towards helping ease the cost-of-living crisis. But on The Sunday Show, Mr Matheson said this was ""insufficient"" to deal with the scale and nature of the crisis being faced by those on low incomes and called for further action from the UK government to help struggling families. He said the 54% rise in the average energy bill would be compounded by the increase in National Insurance contributions and the cut in universal credit. ""There is a real crisis building here,"" he said. ""It has been on the cards for some time now and action from the UK government is wholly inadequate to deal with it sufficiently. ""There is the real risk that lives will be lost this year."" Audrey Flanagan, who helps run a foodbank, believes people will die as a result of the increased costs The programme earlier heard from Audrey Flanagan, from Glasgow South East Foodbank, who said she was seriously concerned about those on low incomes. ""Not only will it be heat or eat but actually we will see people die and, believe me, I don't use that term lightly,"" she said. ""I sat in tears watching what was happening because you can just see the rollout of this. I am gobsmacked, absolutely gobsmacked."" Mr Matheson also said aÂ£200 discount the UK government had announced on energy billsfor homes in Scotland, England and Wales should be a grant instead of a loan. The discount will be automatically recovered from people's bills in equal Â£40 instalments over a five-year period from 2023, when it is hoped global wholesale gas prices will have come down. The energy secretary said: ""There is a very serious risk that if fuel prices stay high over the course of the next couple of years, and that could be the case, it could actually end up forcing more homes into poverty because households are not only having to face high fuel prices but they are also having to face paying back the loan."" He also said the warm homes scheme - which offers those in receipt of certain benefits the option to apply for a one-off Â£140 payment - should be expanded. Mr Matheson highlighted the Scottish government's winter funding package - about Â£41m to help families experiencing difficulty during the winter months - and a specific payment within that to help with fuel costs, particularly helping those on pre-payment meters. Last week, the Scottish government also gave local government an extra Â£120m next year in a bid to ward off big increases in council tax bills. Finance Secretary Kate Forbes said she now had some ""additional flexibility"" due to funding from the UK government. Mr Matheson said fuel poverty was estimated to increase by more than 200,000 homes to almost 900,000 and added that some of those homes would be facing extreme fuel poverty. This video can not be played Energy minister Greg Hands says âa lot is being doneâ to tackle rising prices UK government energy minister Greg Hands told the programme the UK government was already bringing in a number of measures to support those on low incomes. He said: ""We totally recognise the difficulties that many households will be facing with a rise in prices,"" he said. ""In terms of gas and energy prices, those are global prices but we are doing a lot to make sure households are in a better position."" He claimed there were some things that benefited Scotland, including its geography. ""Being closer to the sources of power generation make bills, in some cases, cheaper,"" he said. ""The transmission costs of that energy, for example from renewables - offshore wind in Scotland - will be lower for Scottish consumers than they would for consumers in the south of England."" He said the UK government needed to balance support with fiscal responsibility as it had to spend billions of pounds supporting the economy during the pandemic. He said the Â£200 loan, available from October, was designed to assist people into next winter and would be ""clawed back"" over a five-year period. He added that the national living wage had been increased and that there were ""a lot of important, positive changes coming in"".

Dazzling Eubank Jr outclasses WilliamsChris Eubank Jr produces a dazzling display as he proves a class above Welshman Liam Williams to move closer to a world title shot in 2022.,"Chris Eubank has only been defeated twice as a professional Chris Eubank Jr produced a dazzling display as he proved a class above Welshman Liam Williams to move closer to a world title shot in 2022. Eubank had Williams on the canvas three times in the opening four rounds as he backed up his pre-fight confidence with arguably a career-best performance. Williams showed tremendous heart and bravery to battle on but was again sent to the canvas in the 11th round. Eubank took a unanimous decision 116-109, 116-108 and 117-109 on the cards. ""I am happy with the performance, I wanted to teach that man a lesson, he said some quite menacing things to me in the lead-up to this fight,"" Eubank said. ""I wanted to punish him. I didn't want to knock him out in one round, I wanted to punish him. ""Headbutts, headlocks, I am surprised he didn't get disqualified. But I took it like a man and I punished him like I said I would. It was a fun night. ""I think I showed some of my critics a different side to me. There was no danger, if I had stepped on the gas at any point in the fight he would have been gone. ""There are levels to this game. Don't be a big mouth against guys you can get hurt against."" This video can not be played Born To Brawl: Chris Eubank Jr tells his story before fight with Liam Williams This was the biggest indoor arena boxing show in Cardiff in over 20 years with the Motorpoint  full to capacity for the first time since the heyday of one of Wales' greatest ever, Joe Calzaghe, who drew the sold out signs for a WBO super middleweight title defence in 2001 against Mario Veit. The atmosphere was electric in the Welsh capital with a live rendition of Delilah pumping the volume up to 11 in the first major boxing show of the year in the UK. Eubank predictably entered the arena to a chorus of boos but seemed to relish his status as the bad guy in Cardiff as he looked calm and relaxed with Williams prowling and snarling throughout the pre-fight introductions. Eubank Jr beats Williams - round by round as it happened Claressa Shields shines in win over Ema Kozin An extremely cautious first round exploded into life when Eubank tagged Williams with a jab that caused the Welshman to lose his footing and take a standing count and things soon went from bad to worse for Williams. His corner were massaging his left leg after the first round, but Eubank again dropped the Welshman in the second round as he produced a left hook that saw Williams' legs buckle as his left leg appeared to completely give way. To his credit Williams again answered the count and he enjoyed an even share of the third round before being rocked by a Eubank shot after the bell that angered his corner. However, Eubank put Williams down again following a slick combination in the fourth as a weary Williams struggled to convince the referee not to wave things off. Williams responded and improved in the middle rounds, but by then faced a mountain to climb on the scorecards. This was a genuine grudge match after much trash talking ahead of the fight, with two fighters who clearly don't like one another meeting to settle their issues, but the stakes were higher than that with the UK's number one and number two-ranked middleweights meeting for the first time. Both combatants knew the winner was almost certain to move onto bigger and better things in 2022 as two fighters who have fallen short on the biggest stage look to make amends with another world title opportunity. Eubank and Williams both had everything to prove having fallen short in their biggest fights to date, but it is Eubank who can now look forward to a potential world title shot later this year. In total control of the contest thanks to his succession of early knockdowns and slipping away from Williams' biggest shots, Eubank taunted Williams throughout and again floored his opponent in the 11th round as Williams appealed in vain that he had slipped. Eubank drew some boos for showboating in the final session, but there was no doubting he was a clear and decisive victor. On the undercard there was some Welsh success as former British and Commonwealth welterweight champion Chris Jenkins returned to action with a comfortable 78-75 points victory over former world champion Julius Indongo, while stablemate Rhys Edwards was also victorious.

"Tragic end for boy trapped in Moroccan wellAn anxious wait for news of their five-year-old son, Rayan Oram, ends in grief for the parents.","This video can not be played Cheers turn to tears as news of Rayan's death emerges A five-year-old Moroccan boy who was trapped in a well for four days has died, despite painstaking efforts to rescue him. A royal statement announced his death soon after his removal from the well. The bid to free the boy, Rayan Oram, had gripped the country, with hundreds of people gathered at the well and thousands more following online. The boy plunged 32m (104ft) through the well's narrow opening. The rescue had been hampered by fears of a landslide. Rescuers finally brought the boy out of the well on Saturday evening. No word had been given at the time about his condition, and the apparent rescue was initially met with cheers from the crowds. How Morocco held its breath for Rayan On social media, people using the hashtag #SaveRayan, which had been trending across the country and around the world, expressed their jubilation. But this turned to heartbreak minutes later when the statement came announcing that Rayan had died. Twitter users then began paying tribute and expressing sadness using the same hashtag. ""Rayan's courage will stay in our memories and continue to inspire us,"" AC Milan's Algerian midfielder Ismael Bennacer tweeted. Allow Twitter content?

In a Facebook post, French President Emmanuel Macron wrote: ""Tonight, I want to tell the family of little Rayan and the Moroccan people that we share their pain."" The statement from Morocco's royal palace described Rayan's death as a ""tragic accident"", adding: ""His Majesty King Mohammed VI called the parents of the boy who died after falling down the well."" The king had expressed his deepest condolences and sincere compassion, it added. Rayan's father was repairing the well at the time of the accident on Tuesday. He told local media the following day that his son had fallen down the shaft at ""that one moment I took my eyes off him"", adding: ""I haven't slept a wink."" Rayan's parents leaving the scene after their son's body is taken away by ambulance Led by Morocco's Civil Protection Directorate, rescue operations in the small northern town of Tamorot, around 100km (62 miles) from the city of Chefchaouen, began on Tuesday evening. Footage on Thursday from a camera lowered into the well showed that the boy was alive and conscious, but there had been no update on his condition since then. Rescuers tried to get oxygen, food and water to the boy but it was unclear whether he was able to use them. The mixture of rocky and sandy soils meant rescuers deemed opening the water well's narrow shaft to be too dangerous. Instead, bulldozers were used to cut a huge trench next to the well. Rescuers then started digging horizontally to reach the boy. Some worked round the clock, using powerful floodlights during the night. The operation had to be paused briefly several times to allow crews to check that the hillside was safe from collapsing and that no soil was entering the well. Large pipes were also used to protect rescue teams by providing a secure passage to the shaft. Rescuers dug a huge hole next to the well (front, centre) Hundreds of people gathered to watch the operation, singing religious songs, praying and chanting ""Allahu Akbar (God is greatest)"". Some even camped at the site. One local resident, Hafid El-Azzouz, told AFP news agency that he was there to show ""solidarity with this child, who is dear to Morocco and the whole world"". The incident is reminiscent of a similar tragedy in Spain in 2019, in whicha two-year-old boy died after falling into a borehole near the city of Malaga.

"Tragic end for boy trapped in Moroccan wellAn anxious wait for news of their five-year-old son, Rayan Oram, ends in grief for the parents.Africa","This video can not be played Cheers turn to tears as news of Rayan's death emerges A five-year-old Moroccan boy who was trapped in a well for four days has died, despite painstaking efforts to rescue him. A royal statement announced his death soon after his removal from the well. The bid to free the boy, Rayan Oram, had gripped the country, with hundreds of people gathered at the well and thousands more following online. The boy plunged 32m (104ft) through the well's narrow opening. The rescue had been hampered by fears of a landslide. Rescuers finally brought the boy out of the well on Saturday evening. No word had been given at the time about his condition, and the apparent rescue was initially met with cheers from the crowds. How Morocco held its breath for Rayan On social media, people using the hashtag #SaveRayan, which had been trending across the country and around the world, expressed their jubilation. But this turned to heartbreak minutes later when the statement came announcing that Rayan had died. Twitter users then began paying tribute and expressing sadness using the same hashtag. ""Rayan's courage will stay in our memories and continue to inspire us,"" AC Milan's Algerian midfielder Ismael Bennacer tweeted. Allow Twitter content?

In a Facebook post, French President Emmanuel Macron wrote: ""Tonight, I want to tell the family of little Rayan and the Moroccan people that we share their pain."" The statement from Morocco's royal palace described Rayan's death as a ""tragic accident"", adding: ""His Majesty King Mohammed VI called the parents of the boy who died after falling down the well."" The king had expressed his deepest condolences and sincere compassion, it added. Rayan's father was repairing the well at the time of the accident on Tuesday. He told local media the following day that his son had fallen down the shaft at ""that one moment I took my eyes off him"", adding: ""I haven't slept a wink."" Rayan's parents leaving the scene after their son's body is taken away by ambulance Led by Morocco's Civil Protection Directorate, rescue operations in the small northern town of Tamorot, around 100km (62 miles) from the city of Chefchaouen, began on Tuesday evening. Footage on Thursday from a camera lowered into the well showed that the boy was alive and conscious, but there had been no update on his condition since then. Rescuers tried to get oxygen, food and water to the boy but it was unclear whether he was able to use them. The mixture of rocky and sandy soils meant rescuers deemed opening the water well's narrow shaft to be too dangerous. Instead, bulldozers were used to cut a huge trench next to the well. Rescuers then started digging horizontally to reach the boy. Some worked round the clock, using powerful floodlights during the night. The operation had to be paused briefly several times to allow crews to check that the hillside was safe from collapsing and that no soil was entering the well. Large pipes were also used to protect rescue teams by providing a secure passage to the shaft. Rescuers dug a huge hole next to the well (front, centre) Hundreds of people gathered to watch the operation, singing religious songs, praying and chanting ""Allahu Akbar (God is greatest)"". Some even camped at the site. One local resident, Hafid El-Azzouz, told AFP news agency that he was there to show ""solidarity with this child, who is dear to Morocco and the whole world"". The incident is reminiscent of a similar tragedy in Spain in 2019, in whicha two-year-old boy died after falling into a borehole near the city of Malaga. Morocco gripped by efforts to rescue boy trapped in well.

Charles leads tributes to 'remarkable' Queen,"The Prince of Wales has paid tribute to the Queen on her Platinum Jubilee for the ""remarkable achievement"" of reaching 70 years on the throne. Prince Charles welcomed his mother's wish that Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, be known as Queen Consort when he becomes King. He said he and his wife were ""deeply conscious of the honour"". The Queen is the first British monarch to celebrate a Platinum Jubilee, and is spending the day privately. Queen backs Camilla to be Queen Consort on Jubilee Queen holds reception to mark Platinum Jubilee Platinum Jubilee: Queen's life in pictures When did young Elizabeth realise she would one day be Queen? Ina message marking the 70th anniversary of her reign,external, the Queen said it was her ""sincere wish"" that Camilla would have that title. Prince Charles said in a statement: ""The Queen's devotion to the welfare of all her people inspires still greater admiration with each passing year. ""We are deeply conscious of the honour represented by my mother's wish. As we have sought together to serve and support Her Majesty and the people of our communities, my darling wife has been my own steadfast support throughout."" The Queen's reign began when she was 25 years old, following the death of her father, George VI, on 6 February 1952. The monarch said that, 70 years on, the day is one she remembers ""as much for the death of my father, King George VI, as for the start of my reign"". The 95-year-old said in a written message to the nation: ""I would like to express my thanks to you all for your support. I remain eternally grateful for, and humbled by, the loyalty and affection that you continue to give me."" The Jubilee is the monarch's first without the Duke of Edinburgh, her husband of 73 years, who died last year. She reflected on how much she had gained from support given ""unselfishly"" by Prince Philip and thanked the goodwill shown to her by ""all nationalities, faiths and ages in this country"". The Queensigned off the message,external: ""Your servant Elizabeth R."" Since marrying into the Royal Family 17 years ago, Camilla has grown into her role as a senior royal. The path to public acceptance has been at times rocky, and at first Camilla was a controversial figure who was blamed by some for the end of the prince's first marriage to Princess Diana. In 1994, Charles admitted to adultery with Camilla, but said it came after his marriage to Diana had ""irretrievably broken down"". It was not until 1999 when she and Charles went public with their romance, Since then, Camilla has won over a cautious public. She has been praised for championing her own causes and interests, including supporting literacy charities, animal welfare and organisations helping victims of domestic abuse. Read more here. Many have congratulated the Queen on this historic day, including Boris Johnson, Theresa May and David Cameron - three of the 14 British prime ministers to occupy No 10 during her reign. Mr Johnson posted on Twitter: ""I pay tribute to her many years of service and look forward to coming together as a country to celebrate her historic reign in the summer."" His predecessor, Mrs May, described the monarch as ""an extraordinary woman, who has dedicated her life to the service of her people and our family of nations"". Mr Cameron said: ""There can be no finer example of dignified public duty and service."" Leader of the opposition, Sir Keir Starmer, echoed these sentiments, saying he would like to express his ""deepest thanks"" for 70 years of ""unparalleled public service"". The Labour leader added: ""Her Majesty The Queen has been one vital and valued constant in an ever-changing world, representing security and stability for our country, during the ups and downs of the last seven decades."" A message from the White House said the Queen had, over her 70-year reign, ""strengthened the ties of friendship, shared ideals, and faith in democracy that forever unite our countries"". This video can not be played On Saturday, the Queen made jokes as she cut a cake at a reception for her Platinum Jubilee The Queen used the eve of her Jubilee to directly address the unresolved question of Camilla's future title. There had been suggestions Camilla would be known as Princess Consort. The usual precedent would have been for Camilla to automatically become Queen when Charles was King, but because of uncertainty about public opinion it had been suggested that might not be the case.

Madagascar battered by second storm in two weeksWinds of up to 235km/h and heavy rain are reported as Cyclone Batsirai makes landfall.,"This video can not be played Whole villages swept away in Madagascar At least 10 people have been killed and nearly 50,000 displaced after Cyclone Batsirai brought strong winds and rain to Madagascar on Saturday evening. Batsirai - the second major storm in two weeks - made landfall on the east coast, with gusts of 235km/h (146mph) and high waves hitting coastal areas. Whole villages are reported to be almost completely destroyed. The cyclone has now weakened, according to the national weather service. Madagascar was already reeling from Tropical Storm Ana, which killed 55 people when it hit the Indian Ocean island nation last month. Cyclone Batsirai has compounded the destruction, making landfall near the south-eastern city of Mananjary, 530km from the capital Antananarivo, at around 20:00 (17:00 GMT) on Saturday. Electricity had not been available in Mananjary for two days and the water supply had been disrupted, according to local media. One resident told Reuters that even schools and churches due to be used as evacuation centres had had their roofs torn off. In other places, the destruction was nearly total. ""It's as if we had just been bombed. The city of Nosy Varika is almost 95% destroyed. The solid houses saw their roofs torn off by the wind. The wooden huts have, for the most part, been destroyed,"" Willy Raharijaona, an adviser to the vice president of Madagascar's Senate, told Reuters news agency. Environment Minister Vahinala Raharinirina told the BBC that many villages were nearly completely gone, with some being swept away by the storm. In the east coast city of Mahanoro, the rising sea eroded a sandy hill which was part of a graveyard. Marie Viviane Rasoanandrasana, a 54-year-old widow, sat and watched as the bodies of her husband, father-in-law and daughter were exposed. ""We've already had damages at home because of the cyclone. Now this,"" she told AFP news agency. Around 48,000 people have been displaced, according to the disaster management agency, although the UN World Food Programme (WFP) estimated that as many as 150,000 people could be forced to leave their homes. Some of the displaced were moved to evacuation centres where victims of January's Tropical Storm Ana were also staying. This video can not be played Stav Danaos has the latest as Cyclone Batsirai makes landfall in Madagascar While the cyclone weakened as it moved inland, with the strongest gusts scaling back to around 110km/h, the country's meteorological agency said that the storm would cause ""significant and widespread damage"". Experts fear that Cyclone Batsirai could prove to be even more destructive than Storm Ana, which also hit Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe, and officials have called on the international community to offer assistance. The WFP has prepared food stocks to distribute to those in need, while some people have already been evacuated. The UN has put rescue aircraft on standby. The cyclone is expected to move westwards and emerge at sea in the Mozambique Channel later on Sunday but is then forecast to head south, avoiding mainland Africa. Evacuation shelters are now providing for those displaced by Cyclone Batsirai and Storm Ana The WFP says the recent pattern of destructive storms caused by global warming and climate change has caused failed harvests, high food prices and increased food insecurity in the region. ""The people of Southern Africa have been on the front lines of climate extremes for many years now and each passing storm sets them back, resetting the progress made,"" said senior WFP official Margaret Malu. Experts say that extreme weather events like cyclones will become more frequent because of climate change. Madagascar is also just recovering from the effects of a drought, which was also blamed on global warming. The environment minister told the BBC that the country had submitted a plan to the COP26 climate conference, which showed it needed $1bn (Â£740m) a year to adapt to the effects of climate change.

Tech giants targeted in harmful content crackdownSending genuinely harmful communications will become illegal if the bill becomes law.,"Sending ""genuinely threatening"" or ""knowingly false"" messages are among new criminal offences being added to proposed online safety laws. If passed, the government's online safety bill could see social networks fined 10% of their global turnover if they fail to remove harmful content. The changes mean they will also have to proactively remove harmful content. The bill also covers revenge porn, human trafficking, extremism and promoting suicide online. It already stated that websites, such as Facebook and Twitter, that host user-generated content would have to swiftly remove illegal content once it was reported to them. Now they will also have to put in place proactive measures to stop illegal activity. The issue has become a talking point recently with theracist abuse of footballers, revenge porn andcyberflashing, andCovid disinformationbeing highlighted as key safety concerns for social media companies to address. Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries urged online platforms to start making the changes now before the bill comes into force. Speaking to BBC Breakfast, she said: ""They can start doing what they need to do to remove those harmful algorithms and to remove much of the damage that they do, particularly to young people and to society as a whole."" The minister added the move would ""hold the feet to the fire"" of social media companies that have ""damaged lives"" and hold them to account for the first time. Harmful content could evade new online law - MPs Facebook is 'making hate worse', whistleblower says Twitter says Online Safety Bill needs more clarity I get abuse and threats online - why can't it be stopped? Judy Thomas, whose daughter Frankie took her own life aged 15 in September 2018, said her school tablet and computer had been used to access distressing material in the hours and months before her death. She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""Back in January, February, March [2018] she'd been accessing, at school, horrendous sites."" Ms Thomas called for mandatory age verification to protect children online and said all websites should be included in the scope of the bill, rather than just larger platforms. ""We need to ensure young people simply cannot access online harms, and that if companies do the wrong thing... that there is a real price to pay,"" she said. Ms Thomas added these penalties must not just be financial, as many businesses could ""absorb that easily"", but the heads of these firms must also be ""held to account"". The big technology companies say they welcome the ""clarity"" that the online safety bill brings and that they recognise the need for regulation. They have, in many cases, not waited for governments to step in and they have invested in tech such as machine learning in order to identify harmful content at scale. However, while many say the bill does not go far enough, social media businesses point to free speech issues. They say they want to ensure that new rules don't stifle people's access to information by causing companies to ""over-moderate"" by removing too much content, in order to comply with them. The vast scope of the online safety bill means it will always have its critics. But experts underline that its introduction will be nothing short of a revolution in how the online world is policed, and mean it will be a very different place for the next generation. Asked about age verification, Ms Dorries said the government was looking at the idea, but said there was a ""downside"" to requiring all children to verify their age to access the internet. ""And young people go on to the internet to go shopping, you know, on clothes. Do we need to ensure that they verify their age when they're doing that?"", she added. This video can not be played Fitness influencer Elle Edwards speaks about dealing with explicit messages and cyber-flashing The government confirmed offences to have been added to the list of priority offences, which must be removed by platforms under the changes, include: Revenge porn Hate crimes Fraud The sale of illegal drugs or weapons The promotion or facilitation of suicide People smuggling Sexual exploitation Previously, companies were only forced to take down these posts after they were reported - but will now be required to be proactive in preventing people from seeing them in the first place. The government said naming these offences also enabled Ofcom - the proposed regulator - to take faster action. The changes come after three separate parliamentary committee reports warned the bill required strengthening and more clarity for tech firms. In addition, three new criminal offences have been added to the bill. The first is sending ""genuinely threatening communications"" such as a threat to rape, kill or cause financial harm, or coercive and controlling behaviour and online stalking. Sending ""harmful communications"", such as a domestic abuser sending an ex-partner a photograph of their front door to frighten them, is the second. However, offensive content with no intent to cause serious distress would not be illegal. The final new offence is ""knowingly false communications"", which would cover messages deliberately sent to inflict harm"", such as a hoax bomb threat. The government said the bill would not prohibit ""misinformation"", such as a social media post promoting a fake coronavirus cure, as long as those spreading it were unaware what they were saying was false.

The government said naming these offences also enabled Ofcom - the proposed regulator - to take faster action. The changes come after three separate parliamentary committee reports warned the bill required strengthening and more clarity for tech firms. In addition, three new criminal offences have been added to the bill. The first is sending ""genuinely threatening communications"" such as a threat to rape, kill or cause financial harm, or coercive and controlling behaviour and online stalking. Sending ""harmful communications"", such as a domestic abuser sending an ex-partner a photograph of their front door to frighten them, is the second. However, offensive content with no intent to cause serious distress would not be illegal. The final new offence is ""knowingly false communications"", which would cover messages deliberately sent to inflict harm"", such as a hoax bomb threat. The government said the bill would not prohibit ""misinformation"", such as a social media post promoting a fake coronavirus cure, as long as those spreading it were unaware what they were saying was false.

Dazzling Eubank Jr outclasses WilliamsChris Eubank Jr produces a dazzling display as he proves a class above Welshman Liam Williams to move closer to a world title shot in 2022.BBC Sport,"Chris Eubank has only been defeated twice as a professional Chris Eubank Jr produced a dazzling display as he proved a class above Welshman Liam Williams to move closer to a world title shot in 2022. Eubank had Williams on the canvas three times in the opening four rounds as he backed up his pre-fight confidence with arguably a career-best performance. Williams showed tremendous heart and bravery to battle on but was again sent to the canvas in the 11th round. Eubank took a unanimous decision 116-109, 116-108 and 117-109 on the cards. ""I am happy with the performance, I wanted to teach that man a lesson, he said some quite menacing things to me in the lead-up to this fight,"" Eubank said. ""I wanted to punish him. I didn't want to knock him out in one round, I wanted to punish him. ""Headbutts, headlocks, I am surprised he didn't get disqualified. But I took it like a man and I punished him like I said I would. It was a fun night. ""I think I showed some of my critics a different side to me. There was no danger, if I had stepped on the gas at any point in the fight he would have been gone. ""There are levels to this game. Don't be a big mouth against guys you can get hurt against."" This video can not be played Born To Brawl: Chris Eubank Jr tells his story before fight with Liam Williams This was the biggest indoor arena boxing show in Cardiff in over 20 years with the Motorpoint  full to capacity for the first time since the heyday of one of Wales' greatest ever, Joe Calzaghe, who drew the sold out signs for a WBO super middleweight title defence in 2001 against Mario Veit. The atmosphere was electric in the Welsh capital with a live rendition of Delilah pumping the volume up to 11 in the first major boxing show of the year in the UK. Eubank predictably entered the arena to a chorus of boos but seemed to relish his status as the bad guy in Cardiff as he looked calm and relaxed with Williams prowling and snarling throughout the pre-fight introductions. Eubank Jr beats Williams - round by round as it happened Claressa Shields shines in win over Ema Kozin An extremely cautious first round exploded into life when Eubank tagged Williams with a jab that caused the Welshman to lose his footing and take a standing count and things soon went from bad to worse for Williams. His corner were massaging his left leg after the first round, but Eubank again dropped the Welshman in the second round as he produced a left hook that saw Williams' legs buckle as his left leg appeared to completely give way. To his credit Williams again answered the count and he enjoyed an even share of the third round before being rocked by a Eubank shot after the bell that angered his corner. However, Eubank put Williams down again following a slick combination in the fourth as a weary Williams struggled to convince the referee not to wave things off. Williams responded and improved in the middle rounds, but by then faced a mountain to climb on the scorecards. This was a genuine grudge match after much trash talking ahead of the fight, with two fighters who clearly don't like one another meeting to settle their issues, but the stakes were higher than that with the UK's number one and number two-ranked middleweights meeting for the first time. Both combatants knew the winner was almost certain to move onto bigger and better things in 2022 as two fighters who have fallen short on the biggest stage look to make amends with another world title opportunity. Eubank and Williams both had everything to prove having fallen short in their biggest fights to date, but it is Eubank who can now look forward to a potential world title shot later this year. In total control of the contest thanks to his succession of early knockdowns and slipping away from Williams' biggest shots, Eubank taunted Williams throughout and again floored his opponent in the 11th round as Williams appealed in vain that he had slipped. Eubank drew some boos for showboating in the final session, but there was no doubting he was a clear and decisive victor. On the undercard there was some Welsh success as former British and Commonwealth welterweight champion Chris Jenkins returned to action with a comfortable 78-75 points victory over former world champion Julius Indongo, while stablemate Rhys Edwards was also victorious.
