Woman shoots boyfriend in YouTube stunt,"'It was a prank gone wrong,' said Pedro Ruiz's aunt A Minnesota woman has been charged over the fatal shooting of her boyfriend, in what authorities say was a social media stunt gone wrong. Monalisa Perez, 19, was booked into county jail after shooting at Pedro Ruiz as he held a book to his chest, believing it would stop the bullet. The couple's three-year-old child and nearly 30 onlookers watched as she fired the fatal bullet into his chest. Ruiz's aunt said they did it to increase their social media following. Claudia Ruiz told WDAY-TV that her nephew had told her he wanted to do the stunt ""because we want more viewers, we want to get famous"". ""He had told me about that idea and I said, 'Don't do it. Don't do it. Why are you going to use a gun? Why?'"" Claudia Ruiz told the news channel. ""They were in love, they loved each other,"" she said. ""It was just a prank gone wrong."" What are four of the biggest hazards of social media? Perez is pregnant with the couple's second child Ms Perez, who is pregnant, is facing charges of second degree manslaughter. She faces her first court appearance on Wednesday. County Attorney James Brue described the book as a hardcover encyclopaedia, and said the weapon used was a .50-calibre Desert Eagle handgun. Police have seized two cameras, which are said to have recorded Monday's incident. The single gunshot was fired from about one foot (30cm) away as neighbours gathered to watch outside their Minnesota home. She told deputies that the stunt had been Ruiz's idea, and that he had to convince her to do it. Earlier that day she tweeted about her reservations. ""Everyone was crying. I was standing behind that tree over there. And that was it. I just couldn't take it anymore so I had to go back home,"" neighbour Wayne Cameron told WDAY-TV. The couple had started a YouTube channel in March, aiming to show the ""the real life of a young couple who happen to be teen parents"".

Disabled man forced to crawl on to plane,"Vanilla Air is a budget carrier in Japan Japan's Vanilla Air has apologised after a wheelchair user was forced to crawl up a set of stairs to the plane. Hideto Kijima had boarded with the help of friends on his outbound flight. But on the return leg from the island of Amami, airline employees told him that for safety reasons, he would not be allowed to board if he could not climb the stairs without assistance. In response, Mr Kijima left his wheelchair and pulled himself up the stairs with his arms. Some airlines require disabled passengers to alert them in advance of their accessibility needs. But in his blog Mr Kijima, head of the Japan Accessible Tourist Center, a non-profit organisation which catalogues accessibility issues for tourists to Japan, , said if he had alerted them he believes they would have refused to let him board -- although travel industry insiders question this. Mr Kijima also says that wherever facilities were not available for mobility disabled passengers in the past, he has relied on the help of friends or staff members. He says he has been to more than 200 airports in 158 countries since he was paralysed from the waist down in a school rugby accident in 1990. He also spoke to Japan's Nippon TV, saying he was ""surprised"" by the strict rule. ""I wondered if the airport employees didn't think that was wrong,"" he said. Vanilla Air, a budget airline subsidiary of All Nippon Airways, has apologised for the incident and announced new measures to aid wheelchair users at the airport. The company's website now says that while it cannot provide a boarding bridge at Amami airport, it will now provide a special chair for the purpose. ""We're sorry that we caused him that hardship,"" a company spokesman told AFP news agency. There have been several other incidents this year involving the treatment of passengers by airlines. In April, a Vietnamese-American doctor was dragged from a United Airlines flight in Chicago by law enforcement officials after he refused to give up his seat voluntarily. A video of the incident posted online caused a massive backlash against the airline, forcing it to change its policies andpay a settlement to the injured doctor.

Retired judge to lead Grenfell fire inquiry,"Sir Martin spent more than 20 years as a judge of the Commercial Court and Court of Appeal Retired Court of Appeal judge Sir Martin Moore-Bick has been chosen to lead the public inquiry into the Grenfell Tower fire, the PM has said. Sir Martin said he understood the ""desire of local people for justice"", while Theresa May said ""no stone will be left unturned"" during the inquiry. Grenfell resident Oluwaseun Talabi said victims were unhappy at not being involved in Sir Martin's appointment. Police said80 people are now presumed deadafter the disaster, on 14 June. Adele pays tribute to Grenfell victims 'Stop testing cladding,' says housing boss Guide to what happened No final Grenfell death toll 'this year' Why people invent fake victims However, they warned the final death toll will not be known until at least the end of the year. Oluwaseun Talabi fled the Grenfell Tower fire with his partner and four-year-old daughter In a statement, Sir Martin said the inquiry would seek to discover the truth about what happened at Grenfell Tower, ""so that we can learn lessons for the future"". He said the inquiry must be ""open, transparent and fair"" to all those involved. It should ""establish as quickly as possible the cause of the fire and how it was able to spread so quickly"", he added. Following the announcement, he met local residents and police at Grenfell Tower. Mrs May told MPs she expects Sir Martin will want to produce an interim report ""as early as possible"" to address the immediate lessons from the fire. ""I am determined that there will be justice for all the victims of this terrible tragedy and for their families who have suffered so terribly,"" she added. Joe Delaney, from the Grenfell Action Group, said the fire was ""a criminal matter"" and doubted whether the inquiry could deliver what residents wanted. He said he was willing to give the inquiry the benefit of doubt, but warned residents' patience was ""wafer thin"". But Mr Talabi -who fled the burning building with his partner and four-year-old daughter- added: ""We need a criminal judge. We need serious justice and this man isn't going to give us any justice."" The Metropolitan Police has previously said it will investigate""all criminal offences that may have been committed"". Born in Wales and educated at Christ's College, Cambridge, his career has spanned nearly five decades after being called to the Bar in 1969. As a lawyer, he specialised in commercial law which involved dealing with disputes relating to maritime and land transport of goods. Sir Martin went on to spend more than 20 years as a judge of the Commercial Court and Court of Appeal until his retirement in 2016. However, Grenfell residents have already pointed to a case in November 2014, in which Sir Martin ruled Westminster City Council could rehouse a single mother-of-five more than 50 miles away in Bletchley, near Milton Keynes. The decision was overturned by the Supreme Court in April 2015. Leading barrister Michael Mansfield QC, who has met survivors of the fire, said it was ""unbelievable that lessons are not learned"" from theIndependent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse, which is now on its fourth chairman. He said that inquiry ""did not consult with the families and the survivors"" and ""the same thing seems to have happened all over again"". Some of the victims of the Grenfell Tower fire Eighteen people have been formally identified by the coroner, but not all names have been released. The opening of inquests intoseven of the victims heard six-month-old Leena Belkadi was found deadin her mother's arms. Most of those who died in the fire were said to be in 23 of the North Kensington tower block's 129 flats. Some residents tried to move up the building to escape the flames - and it is thought a number may have ended up in one flat. Police are tracing victims via ""every imaginable source"" of information; from government agencies to fast food firms. This video can not be played Grenfell residents challenge the housing minister live on the Victoria Derbyshire programme Survivors and relatives of those who died have expressed frustration at not getting the help and support they need. They confronted housing minister Alok Sharma MPon the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme on Wednesday, two weeks after the fire. Victims described the problems they had faced in being rehoused; trying to replace burned documents; accessing funding and being unable to return to work. The minister said people would be offered a suitable place to live within three weeks of the fire. All of the cladding samples submitted for fire safety tests have failed Questions were raised about the cladding used on Grenfell in the immediate aftermath of the disaster, which led to a nation-wide operation to test buildings with similar cladding. On Thursday, the prime minister said cladding from 137 high rise buildings has now failed safety tests in 41 local authority areas. This was a 100% failure rate, she told MPs. An expert panel to advise on immediate safety action has been appointed following the safety failures. By Brian Wheeler, BBC News Public inquiries are set up for many reasons. Sometimes they are designed to expose the truth after a controversy, or apportion blame to individuals. More often, they simply produce recommendations, which the government can choose to follow or not. Recent examples include Leveson, into press standards, and Chilcot, into the Iraq War. They differ from police investigations because they are conducted, in part at least, in public. They might even be televised. They can be run by a judge, with witnesses giving evidence under oath, but there is no fixed model. Much depends on the ""terms of reference"". They can also drag on for years and cost millions of pounds - although the government says it wants the Grenfell Tower inquiry to ""move with speed"".

Brexit 'will blow hole in EU budget',"The UK will be taking money from the budget, the EU is warning - at the same time that the bloc will have new outgoings The UK's departure from the EU will leave a budget shortfall of at least â¬10bn (Â£8.8bn; $11.4bn), the budget commissioner has warned. GÃ¼nther Oettinger said the bloc must either spend less or find new money to fill the gap, equivalent to an estimated 16% of the entire budget. Among the options on the table could be less generous payments to farmers or a tax on financial transactions. ""A big country, a net contributor is leaving,"" Mr Oettinger said. ""That must have consequences."" Mr Oettinger said each euro spent must have a positive impact on people's lives, as he presented a discussion paper on the EU's future. Negotiations are under way for the UK to leave the EU by the end of March 2019, following last year's referendum vote. Brexit: All you need to know Article 50: The people who will negotiate Brexit Brexit: What are the options? It is not just Brexit giving the EU a budget headache. ""At the same time we need to finance new tasks such as defence, internal security...,"" Mr Oettinger writes, with regional policy commissioner Corina Cretu,in an EU blog,external. ""The total gap could therefore be up to twice as much."" The BBC's Europe reporter, Adam Fleming, says the disappearance of Britain's annual rebate will make the budget process simpler. The rebate, negotiated under former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, is a complex calculation which sees a sizeable proportion of the UK's net contribution to the EU each year returned. Officials will now consult member states and the European Parliament, our reporter says, They hope the ""Brexit effect"" will be clearer by the end of the year and a draft budget for the years 2020 and beyond will be proposed by the middle of next year.

Cliff fall tour guide named by police,"The lifeboat launched its fast inflatable boat to get to Mr Shannon A tour guide who died when he fell from a cliff in Orkney has been named by police. Jamie Shannon, 23, from the  Stirling area, was fatally injured at Yesnaby on Monday. He was working with an Edinburgh-based company, Haggis Adventures,  guiding a minibus group on a tour of the Highlands and islands. Police said inquiries were continuing but there were no suspicious circumstances. In a statement other staff members at Haggis Adventures said he was ""adored"" as a colleague and a ""best friend"".

It will be absolutely impossible to forget the impact he has had on all of us at Haggis, passengers and staff alike."" they said. ""His smile and laugh were infectious, we will miss his energy, his positivity, his loyalty and most of all his hugs. ""Nobody gives as good a hug as Jamie.

US Ten Commandments monument destroyed,"One of the main backers of the monument said that it ""honoured the historical moral foundation of the law"" A new monument in the US state of Arkansas listing the Ten Commandments has been destroyed less than 24 hours after it was unveiled. The 6ft (1.8m) granite slab was erected in the grounds of the state capitol. A suspect is reported to have driven his car into the structure early on Wednesday while filming on his mobile phone and posting footage on Facebook. Michael Tate Reed is now accused of defacing an object of public interest and criminal trespassing. He is also accused of first-degree criminal mischief. A Facebook Live video by an account under the name of Michael Reed,externalshows what appears to be a driver pointing his headlights towards the monument and shouting ""Freedom!"" as he moves toward it. Michael Tate Reed was arrested in Little Rock, Arkansas Mr Reed was accused of destroying a different Ten Commandments monument in Oklahoma three years ago, media reports say. He was diagnosed with a schizo-affective disorder (a mental health condition) after that incident but was released from hospital in January 2015 as part of an agreement with the Oklahoma County district attorney's office in which he pledged to continue receiving treatment and therapy,Tulsa World reported at the time.,external Former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee tweeted,externalthat ""some idiot in my home state broke all 10 commandments at the same time. He wasn't Moses and it wasn't Mt Sinai"". The initiative to build the statue was led by Arkansas Senator Jason Rapert, who sponsored a 2015 law to display it on state grounds. Mr Rapert said it ""honoured the historical moral foundation of the law"". But opponents including the American Civil Liberties Union said that its appearance amounted to ""an unconstitutional endorsement of religion"" - they threatened to take legal action to have it taken down. The statue was financed by more than $26,000 in private donations, local media reported.

Public sector pay cap 'under review',"This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn tells Theresa May: ""When you cut local authority budgets by 40%, we all pay a price in public safety"" The limit on public sector salary rises could be reviewed, Downing Street has signalled, as a Labour attempt to scrap the 1% cap was defeated in Parliament. Two cabinet ministers have said the five-year cap may be reconsidered while the PM's spokesman suggested the autumn Budget could herald a change of course. Downing Street later sought to dampen down the speculation, insisting current government policy had not changed. And MPs rejected a Labour motion urging immediate change by a majority of 14. The government won the vote on the issue, the first of the new Parliament, by 323 votes to 309. Labour's amendment to the Queen's Speech, which also called for an end to cuts to the police and emergency services, was defeated as the Conservatives and all 10 DUP MPs joined forces to oppose it - for the first time since the two parties announced a parliamentary pact.

The Conservatives went into the election pledging to maintain the cap until 2020, but some MPs are now calling for a rethink after the party lost its majority. This video can not be played Sir Oliver Letwin tells Today a large number of people may pay a little more tax to increase government spending Labour says its motion was a litmus test of MPs' willingness to oppose further austerity measures and the Conservatives had acted as if it was ""business as usual"". ""Although government ministers said they had learned the lessons of the general election and were listening to voters, it is clear that nothing has changed,"" Jeremy Corbyn said. Before the vote, several Conservative MPs called for the cap to be lifted. Speaking during the debate, Conservative MP Andrew Murrison said public sector workers ""give far more back to the service than we give to them in terms of the package"", adding that he was worried the ""well of goodwill"" among medical workers would soon run ""completely dry"". Another Tory MP, former nurse Maria Caulfield, said medical workers ""will vote with their feet"" unless the pay freeze is tackled. Earlier, taking questions at an event in London, Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon said pay rates were ""obviously something we have to consider not just for the army but right across the public sector as a whole"". Laura Kuenssberg, BBC political editor In line with Michael Fallon and Chris Grayling's comments, the government is ready to listen to the case to ""scrap the cap"" - bringing a potential end to the policy that was designed to save Â£5bn for the public purse by 2020. By teatime however, after the Treasury had slightly less enthusiastically said they were ""open to discussion"", that nurse, social worker, teacher or doctor had slightly less cause for feeling optimistic about a bigger pay rise any time soon. Number 10 had perhaps not changed, but certainly tweaked, their tune - saying when asked repeatedly that the policy has not changed, the independent pay review bodies will report in due course and the government will consider their proposals. So far, so confusing. Neither Number 10 nor the Treasury, who it's suggested were not entirely thrilled with the suggestion, are ready by the end of this political day to be able to make such a big change, or to give Labour such a big victory. The problem for them, however, is not just what appears to be a changing mood among some voters, but also very public hints by cabinet members that the cap, becoming painful for some as inflation starts to lift, could disappear along with Theresa May's majority. Read Laura's blog A Number 10 source said public sector pay restraint was ""one of the tough decisions"" the government had had to make but that ministers were going to ""listen to the messages that were sent at the election"" and said, ""we understand that people are weary after years of hard work to re-build the economy"". Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt reiterated this, telling MPs that ministers would wait for the recommendations of the pay review bodies before deciding what action to take. The suggestion of a change of policy was welcomed by campaigners, with TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady saying it would be a ""massive victory for trade union campaigning"". Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, former Conservative minister Sir Oliver Letwin said Labour were  ""playing politics"" but ""carefully judged"" tax increases might be needed to raise money for public services. This video can not be played Theresa May warns councils they should be ""doing the fire safety checks now"" ""It may well be that, in one way or another, a large number of people will have to pay a little more tax if we are going to maintain the trend towards reduced deficits and yet spend a bit more on the crucial public services that do need more spending,"" he added. Meanwhile, the latestBritish Social Attitudes Survey,externalhas found an increase in the number of Britons who think the government should raise taxes and increase spending to its highest level since 2004. Earlier, during PMQs, Mr Corbyn linked the Grenfell Tower disaster to spending cuts. After Mrs May confirmed cladding from 120 high-rise buildings in 37 local authority areas in England had now failed fire safety tests, Mr Corbyn - to an angry reaction from some on the Conservative benches - said this was because cuts to local authority budgets had led to fewer building control and planning inspectors. ""We all pay a price,"" he said, saying there were fewer firefighters in place and that the pay cap had affected recruitment. ""What the Grenfell Tower tragedy has exposed is the disastrous effect of austerity. Labour frontbenchers wore badges highlighting the campaign to end the NHS pay squeeze ""This disregard for working-class communities, the terrible consequences of deregulation and cutting corners - I urge the prime minister to come up with the resources needed to test and remove cladding, retrofit sprinklers, properly fund the fire service and the police so that all our communities can feel safe in their own homes."" Mrs May said the cladding of tower blocks had begun under Tony Blair's Labour government, saying this was an issue that had ""developed over decades"" under successive governments and different councils. Labour has claimed fire and rescue budgets were cut by 30% between 2010 and 2015, and a further 20% cuts are envisaged between 2015 and 2020. But Home Secretary Amber Rudd said the number of fire incidents had halved since 2010 and firefighters' rapid response to the Grenfell tragedy showed the strength of the service.

Italy may stop ships unloading migrants,"This video can not be played This man was dramatically rescued from a boat's rudder by Italy's coastguard Italy has threatened to stop vessels of other countries from bringing migrants to its ports. The warning came as Italy's EU representative, Maurizio Massari, warned in a letter to the bloc the situation had become ""unsustainable"". Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni has accused other European nations of ""looking the other way"". An estimated 10,000 people are believed to have attempted the journey from North Africa in the past four days. More than 73,000 migrants have landed in Italy this year, an increase of 14% on the same period last year. Aboard the Mediterranean's migrant rescue boats Pope Francis: Europe migrant centres are 'concentration camps' Some 2,000 have died or are missing feared drowned, the UN's refugee agency says, the vast majority attempting the crossing from Libya. Libya is a gateway to Europe for migrants from across sub-Saharan Africa and also from the Arabian peninsula, Egypt, Syria and Bangladesh. Many are fleeing war, poverty or persecution. The Italian coastguard takes the lead in co-ordinating rescue operations but many of the vessels run by non-profit groups sail under the flags of other nations including EU countries like Germany and Malta. This video can not be played This video from May shows the coastguard rescuing a migrant clinging to a ship's rudder An Italian government source told Reuters: ""The idea of blocking humanitarian ships flying foreign flags from returning to Italian ports has been discussed. Italy has reached saturation point."" Former Prime Minister Matteo Renzi said the Italian public were ""exasperated"" with the issue and a new long-term strategy was needed. Rules on disembarking are governed by international law and the EU office on migration said any changes to guidelines should give humanitarian groups time to prepare. The International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea dictates that any ship learning of distress at sea must assist regardless of circumstances, and that the country responsible for operations in that area has primary responsibility for taking them from the ship. It also clearly states that the relevant government ""shall arrange for such disembarkation to be effected as soon as reasonably practicable."" For boats departing from western Libya, Italy is likely to be the closest port. The European Commissioner for Immigration, Dimitri Avramopoulos, met Italy's Mr Massari to discuss the crisis. ""Italy is right that the situation is untenable,"" he said, adding that the country's management of the crisis was ""exemplary"". It was time for EU member states to ""step up"", he said, and contribute financial support to Italy if needed, along with aid to African nations like Libya to reduce the numbers of people leaving -a promise made in February. ""Now is the moment to deliver, and we will hold them to this,"" the commissioner said. ""In everything we do, we all have a humanitarian obligation to save lives... we cannot leave a handful of EU countries on their own to deal with this."" Medical charity Medicins Sans Frontieres said it had been calling for more support from the EU for some time, urging that ""all the states should take part"", Ansa news agency reported. Yes. In April,an Italian prosecutor claimed humanitarian charities were ""colluding"" with people smugglers in Libya, alleging that phone calls were made between the two parties. Italy has seen more than 500,000 migrants arrive by boat since 2014. The closure of a land route north through the Balkans has added to the pressure. Libya has been in chaos since long-serving ruler Muammar Gaddafi was ousted in October 2011. On Wednesday, seven UN staff who had been visiting a migrant detention centre in the western town of Surman were seized by gunmen as their convoy headed towards the capital, Tripoli. They were later released unharmed to local security forces. A note on terminology:The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries such as Syria, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants.

Woman 'shot boyfriend in YouTube stunt',"'It was a prank gone wrong,' said Pedro Ruiz's aunt A Minnesota woman has been charged over the fatal shooting of her boyfriend, in what authorities say was a social media stunt gone wrong. Monalisa Perez, 19, was booked into county jail after shooting at Pedro Ruiz as he held a book to his chest, believing it would stop the bullet. The couple's three-year-old child and nearly 30 onlookers watched as she fired the fatal bullet into his chest. Ruiz's aunt said they did it to increase their social media following. Claudia Ruiz told WDAY-TV that her nephew had told her he wanted to do the stunt ""because we want more viewers, we want to get famous"". ""He had told me about that idea and I said, 'Don't do it. Don't do it. Why are you going to use a gun? Why?'"" Claudia Ruiz told the news channel. ""They were in love, they loved each other,"" she said. ""It was just a prank gone wrong."" What are four of the biggest hazards of social media? Perez is pregnant with the couple's second child Ms Perez, who is pregnant, is facing charges of second degree manslaughter. She faces her first court appearance on Wednesday. County Attorney James Brue described the book as a hardcover encyclopaedia, and said the weapon used was a .50-calibre Desert Eagle handgun. Police have seized two cameras, which are said to have recorded Monday's incident. The single gunshot was fired from about one foot (30cm) away as neighbours gathered to watch outside their Minnesota home. She told deputies that the stunt had been Ruiz's idea, and that he had to convince her to do it. Earlier that day she tweeted about her reservations. ""Everyone was crying. I was standing behind that tree over there. And that was it. I just couldn't take it anymore so I had to go back home,"" neighbour Wayne Cameron told WDAY-TV. The couple had started a YouTube channel in March, aiming to show the ""the real life of a young couple who happen to be teen parents"".

'I was trying to keep people alive',"This video can not be played PC Marques fought all three attackers at the same time The police officer who single-handedly tried to stop the London Bridge attackers took them on armed just with his baton. PC Wayne Marques of British Transport Police was temporarily blinded in one eye as the three attackers slashed at him with their knives. The men drove into pedestrians on 3 June then stabbed people, killing eight and injuring 48. ""All I was trying to do was keep people alive,"" the policeman told the BBC. Khuram Shazad Butt, Rachid Redouane and Youssef Zaghba were shot by specialist armed police at Borough Market. What powers do the police have? Who were the attackers? Eyewitnesses believe PC Marques' fearlessness saved lives. He thought he would die in the dramatic confrontation but says he was only doing his job. The 38-year-old, originally from Birmingham, has been a police officer for less than two years, following six years as a community support officer. During his attempt to stop the three attackers, who appeared to be armed with suicide bombs, PC Marques received major injuries to his head above his eye and left leg near the hip. He also suffered wounds to his hands as he tried to defend himself. His sight has returned but he does not know if he will return to work. PC Marques was on a nightshift at London Bridge on 3 June and looking forward to watching the Champions League football final highlights on his break. He then heard screams coming from the direction of the bridge and realised something was wrong. Khuram Butt, Rachid Redouane and Youssef Zaghba: PC Marques fought all three at once ""I don't see who's screaming - but what stood out to me was everyone at that bar was absolutely static - like statues. The bouncers, the people having a cigarette, the people in the queue. All still and staring in one direction."" Thinking there had been a pub or gang fight, he ran down the road and was told there had been a stabbing. ""I had no real idea what was going on - and I hear this woman scream behind me. I look and see a young woman and she is being attacked by the first one. I see another man running towards me and he falls flat. ""When he falls to the floor I see the first attacker with the knife in his hand. And then my brain starts to click into gear. ""This guy on the floor is pleading for his life and the attacker stands over him and continues to attack him. Photographer Gabriele Sciotto's image from the attack appears to show a man with canisters around his waist ""I take my baton with my right hand and I rack [extend] it. I take a deep breath and I charge in. ""I try to take the first one out in one go. I swing as hard as I can - everything behind it - aiming straight through his head. ""I know I managed to get a good hit on him and I am starting to overpower him. He's yelping in pain - he's not completely on the floor, but he is lower down. ""Then I get a massive whack to the side of my head. I felt metal."" The second of the three attackers had rushed in and stabbed PC Marques above his right eye. ""As soon as I get the whack, my right eye goes dark. Just lights out. I got the stun from the whack to my head, I'm stumbling and I manage to look up and I see a knife coming towards me. ""It was instinct more than anything - I just put my hand out and blocked his wrist with my baton."" As the second man advanced, the men ended up brawling as the attackers tried to stab PC Marques into submission. ""We're going at it - I'm not sure who's hitting who - I'm just fighting. And then I see the third one come in."" Over what he believes was around ninety seconds, he continued to try to fight all three of them at once. But as he tried to control all three men, the first attacker who was still on the ground stabbed him in the leg. ""I look down and see there is a knife in the side of my leg. I realised the first one had got back up and started sticking it in my leg to bring me down. ""I've got one voice in my head - 'don't go down, don't go down'. I'm just swinging at them. I didn't realise how badly I was hurt."" The three attackers put some distance between themselves and the officer and turned to face him. ""And that's when I get to size them up,"" he said. ""The short one - he was the one that I heard saying 'Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar'. He said it a few times, eyes bulging. ""It's almost like some surreal cowboy movie, getting ready to draw. I'm just getting ready for them to rush me. ""For some reason they didn't come to rush me, to finish me off. I couldn't tell you why. Your guess is as good as mine."" The attackers rushed off to find other victims and PC Marques' colleagues arrived at the scene. ""I said, 'you've got to go, you've got to go get them'. I was bleeding out all over - I knew I had been damaged and hurt. ""In my left eye, that black shroud starts to close in. I knew time was up. I thought that was it, my time is coming to an end. ""I call the officer who is holding my hand, I've got blood in my mouth and I'm spitting it out. I start to give him my last messages for my family and partner. He's like, 'no, mate'. And I'm saying, 'just do it' and the last light goes. I'm out."" PC Marques woke up in hospital and after a series of operations was discharged on Friday. He is taking 25 pills a day for his injuries. PC Marques and colleagues on London Bridge before the the attack He hopes to regain full use of his legs but says it is too early to say if he will ever return to work as a police officer. ""That decision may be taken out of my hands depending on what state I'm in in the months ahead. When that bridge comes, I will make that decision. The only clear answer I have for you about being a police officer is that it's what I'm good at. I'm good at what I do. ""Am I a hero? I guess in a lot of people's eyes I am, but there are still eight people that lost their lives and many more that got wounded. ""All I was trying to do was keep people alive. That was my job, keep people alive. And that's what I did, that's what I tried to do."" London Bridge attackers' inquests open Who were the attackers?

No final Grenfell death toll 'this year',"This video can not be played Many Grenfell residents told the housing minister they wanted ""actions before words"" The final Grenfell Tower fire toll will not be known until at least the end of the year, with 80 people currently presumed dead, police have said. Most of those who died in the 14 June blaze were said to be in 23 of the North Kensington building's 129 flats. Police are tracing victims via ""every imaginable source"" of information; from government agencies to fast food firms. The opening of inquests into seven of the victims heard a six-month-old baby was found dead in her mother's arms. Survivors and relatives of those who died have expressed frustration at the progress of the investigation. But Det Supt Fiona McCormack said the full death toll would only be known when the search and recovery operation and identification process was over. ""What I can say is that we believe that around 80 people are either dead or sadly missing and I must presume that they are dead,"" the officer said. She added:  ""I don't want there to be any hidden victims. We want to understand the true human cost of this tragedy."" The previously given death toll from the fire was 79. Who are the victims? Guide to what happened Angry residents confront minister The Metropolitan Police announcement came asPrime Minister Theresa May told MPs that claddingfrom 120 high-rise buildings in 37 local authority areas in England has now failed fire safety tests. Mrs May rejected Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn's claim that the fire was the result of fewer building control inspectors and ""the disastrous effect of austerity"", saying the cladding of tower blocks was an issue that had ""developed over decades"" under successive governments and councils. In the update to the investigation, police said: Some residents had tried to move up the building to escape the flames and it is thought a number of people may have ended up in one flat The 23 flats where most victims are believed to have died were located between the 11th and 23rd floors - and the fire service received 26 calls from residents there There was ""utter devastation inside the flats,"" with a few homes still in too unsafe a condition to carry out further investigations More than 60 ""companies and organisations"" played a role in the refurbishment of Grenfell Tower - work that is believed to have helped aid the spread of the fire Police said ""it would have been impossible for anyone to produce a list before that showed exactly who was in Grenfell Tower that night - that includes those people living there but also those visiting"". ""What I can tell you is there are 129 flats inside Grenfell Tower. We, the police, have spoken to at least one occupant of 106 of those 129 flats,"" Det Supt McCormack said. ""These people have been able to tell us not just who lived in those flats, but importantly who was in those flats on the night."" The officer said 18 people connected to those 106 flats are dead or missing presumed dead but ""it is a terrible reality that there are 23 flats where despite huge investigative efforts, we have been unable to trace anyone alive who lived there. ""At this stage, we must presume, that no-one in those 23 flats survived, that includes anyone who lived there or was visiting them."" Six questions for the investigation Why do high-rises keep failing fire tests? Det Supt McCormack said officers were having to prepare some families for the reality that their relatives' remains may never be recovered. Westminster coroner Dr Fiona Wilcox opened and adjourned more inquests into the deaths ofvictims, including baby Leena Belkadi and her sister Malak, aged eight. Leena, who died from inhalation of fire fumes, was found with her mother in a stairwell between the 19th and 20th floor. The inquests into the deaths of the girl's parents - Farah Hamdan and Omar Belkadi - were opened earlier. The other inquests to opened included that of Syrian refugee Mohammed Al Haj Ali, 23, who was the first fatality to be formally identified by police. He had been previously named as Mohammad Alhajali. This video can not be played Oluwaseun Talabi talked about his survival as he revisited the tower, two weeks on Local people have created their own databases on missing people with figures which differ from those officially released. Police say they hoped information would be sent to its investigation if it might help to identify the missing. Meanwhile, a number of Grenfell Tower residents confronted housing minister Alok Sharma MP on why the homeless are not yet rehoused, in tense exchangeson the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme. Many said they had not been able to sleep since the disaster, or were haunted by images of their escape and their friends, family and neighbours who perished. The fire destroyed 151 homes, most in the tower block, but also a number of surrounding properties. Mr Sharma said the government guaranteed people who had had their homes destroyed would be offered suitable temporary accommodation within three weeks. But Mahad Egal, who escaped the fourth floor of Grenfell Tower, told the programme he refused the offer of alternative accommodation in a high rise block for his family. Oluwaseun Talabi, said he had lost everything and was living with his wife and young daughter in a hotel room. ""I am not going to take any house you give me, it has to be suitable,"" he said. ""I was happy in my house. I work hard. I want permanent accommodation."" Are you affected by the issues raised in this story?

Six face Hillsborough disaster charges,"This video can not be played Crown Prosecution Service statement on Hillsborough Former Ch Supt David Duckenfield faces 95 charges of manslaughter and five other senior figures will be prosecuted over the 1989 Hillsborough disaster. Mr Duckenfield was match commander at the FA Cup semi-final when 96 Liverpool fans were fatally injured in a crush. Ex-South Yorkshire Police (SYP) Ch Insp Sir Norman Bettison, two officers, a solicitor and a Sheffield Wednesday club secretary also face charges. Campaigners said the charges ""send a message about accountability"". Last year, new inquests into the disaster at the Liverpool v Nottingham Forest match, held at Sheffield Wednesday's ground, concluded the fans had been unlawfully killed. The inquests found that Liverpool supporters were not responsible for the dangerous situation at the Leppings Lane turnstiles. For legal reasons, Mr Duckenfield cannot be charged over the death of the 96th victim, Tony Bland, as he died four years after the disaster, prosecutors said. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) must apply to the High Court to lift an order imposed after he was prosecuted privately in 1999, which must be removed before he can be charged. An application will be made to the High Court in a matter of weeks and a senior judge will make a ruling in due course. (Left to right, top to bottom) Sir Norman Bettison, Graham Mackrell, Peter Metcalf, Alan Foster and Donald Denton The full list of individuals and charges are: Mr Duckenfield, 72, faces manslaughter by gross negligence of 95 men, women and children Sir Norman, 61, faces four charges of misconduct in a public office relating to alleged lies he told in the aftermath about the culpability of fans Graham Mackrell, former Sheffield Wednesday club secretary, will be accused of breaching Health and Safety and Safety at Sports Ground legislation Peter Metcalf, who was a solicitor acting for SYP, is charged with perverting the course of Justice, relating to changes to witness statements Former Ch Supt Donald Denton and former Det Ch Insp Alan Foster are accused of perverting the course of justice The six men charged over Hillsborough Hillsborough: Criminal charges explained The defendants, other than Mr Duckenfield, will appear at Warrington Magistrates' Court on 9 August. No organisation will face corporate charges and no-one from the ambulance service will be charged, said Sue Hemming, head of special crime and counter-terrorism at the CPS. She explained that Sheffield Wednesday is now a ""different company"" and, as it is not a successor organisation, is not criminally liable for any offences that might have been committed in 1989. The CPS brought charges following referrals from the Operation Resolve investigation into the causes of the disaster and the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) probe. Assistant Commissioner Rob Beckley, from Operation Resolve, said: ""Our inquiry looked at all aspects of the event, including the planning and the preparation for the game, the safety of the stadium and the response by the emergency services."" Twelve individuals and three organisations were referred to the CPS by the Resolve team. The IPCC investigated the conduct of both SYP and West Midlands Police (WMP) in the days and weeks afterwards. Any decision regarding WMP, which was brought in to carry out the original investigation into the conduct of SYP officers, will be made at a later date.

She said: ""Following our careful review of the evidence, in accordance with the code for Crown prosecutors, I have decided that there is sufficient evidence to charge six individuals with criminal offences. ""Criminal proceedings have now commenced and the defendants have a right to a fair trial."" Campaigner Trevor Hicks, whose daughters Victoria, 15, and Sarah, 19, died in the disaster, said: ""There will be six people facing criminal charges who might not have done if we hadn't been resilient and all stuck together and fought this long fight. ""There are no winners in this, it doesn't bring anybody back. ""What it does do is send a message about accountability, as we keep saying, that nobody but nobody is above the law; be it the police or anybody else."" Chairwoman of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, Margaret Aspinall, whose son James, 18, was killed, said: ""This is definitely the start of the end. ""I think everybody needs that, I think we all need peace from Hillsborough but we can never have peace until we've got truth, justice, accountability. ""I think that's the time we'll all have peace."" Barry Devonside leaving Parr Hall in Warrington after the charges were announced Barry Devonside, whose son Christopher, 18, was killed in the disaster, said: ""Everybody applauded when it was announced that the most senior police officer on that particular day will have charges presented to him."" Evelyn McDonnell Mills, whose brother Peter McDonnell, 21, died, said she was ""really happy"", but sad that her brother who campaigned for years and died during the new inquests never got to see their conclusion. Relatives hugged and wiped away tears after the CPS announced its decision to charge six individuals Pete Weatherby QC, who represents 22 of the victims' families, said they had ""always known that accountability is the most difficult objective"". ""They remain keen to see the criminal process properly pursued for those who have been charged... [and] hope that the memories of their loved ones and the integrity of the fans who attended Hillsborough will be respected during the process."" Lawyer Marcia Willis-Stewart, speaking on behalf other families, said: ""The families are sensitive to the issues of fairness and due process and no-one wishes to prejudice or to jeopardise it. ""There are of course various legal options open to the families where decisions have been made not to prosecute, in the form of the victim and judicial review process."" Inquests into the disaster at Sheffield Wednesday's stadium concluded the fans had been unlawfully killed BBC News profiles of all those who died At Prime Minister's Questions, Theresa May said: ""I know from working closely with the families when I was home secretary that this will be a day of mixed emotions for them."" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn offered a ""tribute to all of those that spent a great deal of time trying to ensure there was justice for those that died at Hillsborough"". Sir Norman has said he is ""disappointed to be charged"" and will ""vigorously defend"" his innocence. Mr Duckenfield and Mr Denton's legal representative Ian Lewis, from JMW Solicitors said ""it would be inappropriate for me as their solicitor, or for my clients themselves, to make any comment"". Mr Metcalf declined to comment. Dr Alan Billings, the South Yorkshire police and crime commissioner, said he hoped the start of criminal proceedings would ""lead to a measure of closure for the family members who have experienced a long and traumatic process"".

Michael Bond and the enduring affection for Paddington,"Michael Bond's Paddington Bear has become one of the classic characters in children's literature. A chance encounter with a toy bear in a London shop spawned a long line of books, a BBC TV series, a feature film and a lot of merchandise. A prolific writer, he also created The Herbs, featuring Parsley the Lion, which became a successful TV series and the tale-telling guinea pig, Olga da Polga. And for adults there was Monsieur Pamplemousse, the retired detective turned restaurant critic and his bloodhound, Pommes Frites. Thomas Michael Bond was born on 13 January 1926 in Newbury and raised in nearby Reading. One of his earliest childhood memories was standing by the railway line to watch the Cornish Riviera Express thunder past on its way from Paddington to Penzance. Bond's father was the mild-mannered manager of the local post office and was the basis for the character of Paddington Bear, the unassuming ursine stowaway. ""My father was a very polite man and he always wore a hat,"" Bond said. ""We'd go on holiday to the Isle of Wight and he used to go in the sea with his trousers rolled up and keep his hat on in case he met someone he knew and would have something to raise. He would have been mortified if he hadn't."" His parents instilled in him a love of books and he later remembered never going to sleep without a bedtime story. The Herbs first appeared on the BBC in 1968 Bond's happy childhood was interrupted when his parents sent him to a strict Catholic school where the Brothers kept discipline with heavy rubber straps. Bond often suffered this brutal treatment, so much so that he left school at 14 and got a job as a clerk in a local solicitor's office. A year later he was working for the BBC which, impressed with his hobby of building amplifiers and other electrical gadgets, gave him a junior job at a transmitter facility in Reading. His budding career nearly came to a premature end when four German bombs fell on the building where he was working. Despite the ground floor being blown out he escaped unharmed. In 1943 he volunteered for the RAF, later transferring to the army. It was while he was stationed in Egypt that he submitted a short story to the magazine London Opinion, which paid him seven guineas for it. At that point he decided he quite liked the idea of becoming a writer. Bond returned to the BBC in 1947, working at Caversham Park which monitored foreign broadcasts. Three years later he became a BBC cameraman, working on programmes including Blue Peter, while continuing to write short stories. On his way home from work on Christmas Eve in 1956, Bond spied a lonely teddy bear on the shelf in a shop window, and took it home as a stocking filler for his wife. He called it Paddington because they were living near Paddington Station at the time. While musing over a typewriter and a blank sheet of paper, he wondered idly what it would be like if an unaccompanied bear turned up at a railway station looking for a home. The seeds of the idea had taken root during the war when Bond saw newsreels of children being sent out from British cities to avoid German bombing. ""I had memories of children being evacuated from London with a label around their necks and all their possessions in a suitcase, and this became part of Paddington as well,"" he said. ""Paddington Bear was a refugee with a label - 'Please look after this bear. Thank you', and he had a little suitcase."" The BBC's Paddington series proved a success with both children and parents A Bear Called Paddington appeared in 1958 with illustrations by Peggy Fortnum. Ivor Wood would later take over the drawings and he went on to develop the successful BBC TV series that first aired in 1976. Wood came up with the idea of a three-dimensional puppet which moved, using stop motion techniques, against a two-dimensional drawn background. Bond wrote the scripts and the actor, Michael Hordern, narrated the stories. During the 1960s, Bond turned out an average of one Paddington book a year but didn't feel secure enough to become a full-time writer until 1965, when he quit his job with the BBC. Later that decade came the first of the Parsley books, featuring a lion and his friends including Sage the Owl and Sir Basil and Lady Rosemary. These books too were successfully translated onto TV by Wood and his company, FilmFair, first as The Herbs in 1968 and then The Adventures of Parsley which aired in 1970. While aimed at children, it became cult viewing for adults who appreciated the dry humour which probably escaped the target audience. In 1971 Bond published the first of his Olga da Polga stories for children, featuring a guinea pig with a penchant for telling tall stories in the manner of Baron Munchausen. Bond next turned to writing for adults with his Monsieur Pamplemousse books, the first of which appeared in 1983. The idea of a French detective who quit the police and became a restaurant critic came when Bond - a Francophile - was eating in a French restaurant. Pamplemousse and his faithful bloodhound, Pommes Frites, travel the country, sampling menus and getting into a series of comic mystery adventures. The books are full of the wry humour that was Bond's trademark. Bond described the 2014 feature film as 'charming' But the popularity of his original creation never seemed to wane and Bond continued to write adventures for the little bear. As well as the books, a huge merchandising operation was built up and Paddington toys remained high on the wish list of new generations of children. Designer Shirley Clarkson was one of the first licensees to produce the figure with his now famous hat, wellington boots and duffel coat. She made the very first Paddington Bear as a Christmas present for her young son, Jeremy (future presenter of the BBC's Top Gear). In 2014 StudioCanal released a feature film of Paddington, with the bear voiced by Ben Whishaw. Bond, who had a cameo role, called the film ""absolutely delightful"". Since 1958, more than 150 different Paddington titles have been published, and more than 35 million copies have been sold worldwide in more than 40 languages. Bond was still writing in recent months, with Paddington's Finest Hour published in April of this year. It is a volume of letters from the bear to his Aunt Lucy in Peru - the relative who originally despatched him to London more than half a century previously. Michael Bond was once asked why the popularity of Paddington had endured for children in the age of computers and video games. ""Paddington is eternally optimistic and always comes back for more, no matter how many times his hopes are dashed,"" he said. ""It's simply the joy of a little bear who is an outsider getting into scrapes and mishaps - always with the best of intentions - and coming out on top every time.""

Retro gaming: Returning to the classics,"Whether you enjoyed curling up with Tetris on a Gameboy, rolling around as Sonic on a Sega, or were just trying to ignore the loud beeping sounds coming from the next room... if you were around in the 1980s and 1990s, you will remember the arrival of home gaming. Computers had made it into our living rooms, and although fans had their favourites - the thrust of Street Fighter, the platforms of Super Mario or the simplicity of Pacman - children and adults alike were hooked. The market for consoles has continued to grow over the decades as technology companies across the globe try to get their bite out of the gaming pie. But almost 20 years into the new millennium, passionate players are still looking back in time to find their fix. Mario caps Nintendo's triumphant comeback Hopes of a games arcade revival ""While there's definitely an element of nostalgia, it's important to recognise how well designed many of those classic games are,"" said technology journalist and retro game collector KG Orphanides. ""The developers had so little space to work with - your average Sega Mega Drive or SNES cartridge had a maximum capacity of just 4MB - and limited graphics and sound capabilities."" The average game now weighs in at 40GB. But these limitations did not stop them from making some memorable games. Gemma Wood, from Basingstoke, has never put her Nintendo GameCube in the loft - despite having it for more than 15 years. ""I love it, in fact I was playing Mario Sunshine and Mario Kart Double Dash yesterday,"" she said. ""I really could not get on with the controls on the Wii [a more recent Nintendo console] and, with retro consoles, most of the games are cheap because they are second hand. ""Newer consoles and their games are incredibly expensive. I understand that a lot of hard work has gone into the design etc, but how can anyone justify Â£50 to Â£60 for a game that you might not even enjoy?"" Many fans still have their original games to play For others, it is a chance to show their children the computer games they grew up with. Howard Gardner, from south London, has revived his love of the Amstrad CPC and cannot wait to see the faces of his sons and daughter. ""Five years ago, when clearing out my uncle's house, I found another CPC, restored it to working order and re-acquired some of my old favourite games from eBay - and a laughably outdated 3D modelling package,"" he said. ""I don't get a whole lot of time to use it, but I plan to show the children the games I used to play and film a reaction video!"" Whatever your reason for picking up an old joypad, you are not alone, and it is not just an activity to take part in on your own or with the family at home. There is now a huge community of retro gamers across the country who love to share their passion. The National Videogame Arcade, which opened in Nottingham in 2015,is a centre of all things gaming. It welcomes thousands of visitors every year and runs huge events to make the point that gaming is for everyone. Young and old gamers enjoy playing Nintendo at the NVA ""It's one of the things we talk about a lot at the NVA,"" said its director Iain Simons. ""You don't know where you are unless you know where you've been. It's important that just because technology has moved forward, it doesn't necessarily mean that new games are better than old ones."" But he warned new gamers not to be complacent. ""One of the things we do notice is that a lot of home computer games from the 80s were much harder than the games that kids are playing these days,"" said Iain. ""Kids on school trips get very upset to discover that they can't even beat level one of Donkey Kong!"" The retro aspect has even spread to the way people buy their games. Kevin Cornwall manages retro games shop Playnation Games in Croydon and says the physical store adds to the feel. ""It is what people want,"" he said. ""It is that feeling of nostalgia, being able to look through the games, see and feel the boxes. ""Modern gaming has had its pitfalls so now people are looking to the past to relive some real gaming memories."" If you want to try before you buy, there has also been a resurgence in arcades or gaming cafes. These were something more common in the US or Japan when the games took off, but now the UK is getting in on the action. Konbo Arcade Cafe offers gaming with your coffee and croissants Konbo Arcade Cafe in Edinburgh offers classic arcade machines and believes a good game never goes out of style. Owner Michael Cox said: ""Konbo is influenced by the Japanese arcade scene and, over there, old games weren't removed and brought back in response to a trend - they never went away. ""They were simply accepted as good games - no level of gimmickry or nostalgia involved, no more than we would treat a 20-year-old film or piece of music as a novelty. ""A good game doesn't stop being a good game, and there's no reason a new generation of people can't rediscover and enjoy it all over again."" One of the household names of the gaming revolution, Nintendo, has always been a big draw - so much so, it has revived some of its older consoles in brand new casings, offering a collection of games in one handy machine. Last year's NES Classic was the must-have Christmas gift, but left fans disappointed when demand outstripped supply and the device was discontinued in April. Now, the company isbringing its SNES backin the same format and promising not to make the same error. Atari has also announced it will be bringing out a new console - 40 years after its original Video Computer System. CEO Fred Chesnais told GamesBeat: ""We're back in the hardware business."" Atari is making a comeback after 40 years ""Those games are very approachable,"" added KG. ""You can sit down and play for 10 or 20 minutes and feel that you've had a genuinely rewarding experience."" Retro gaming fans have welcomed the new devices - though it will not stop them collecting the original machines and cartridges. Take Andy Aldred, who has 19 consoles, alongside his PC, eight hand-held devices and over 1,000 games in a dedicated room. ""They are a really decent way of getting a nice collection of classic games for a reasonable price,"" he said. ""Buying the original hardware and all those games would cost a small fortune."" He still takes advantage of the newer technology on offer, but there is something special about the older genre. ""For a lot of people there is an element of nostalgia and being able to own all the games they wanted to play growing up,"" he said. You may reminisce about these games in a fun way - the fighting with your siblings over the next turn or the shouts of ""hadouken"" as you battled. You may recall a general feeling of confusion from the whole hubbub and noisy soundtrack. Or you may be dedicated to your modern Xbox, PlayStations and Switches. But in 2017, there is no denying the old school technology is well and truly back, and far from Game Over.

Deciphering the public sector pay hints,"Nurse, social worker, teacher, doctor - pretty much any public sector worker in England, Wales and Northern Ireland would have been justified in feeling a bit more chipper this morning, had they had time to listen to comments from the defence secretary or the transport secretary, both hinting that the limit on their pay rises might be about to come to an end. They might been further bolstered by comments after Prime Minister's Questions, if they had been watching the news this afternoon, when Number 10's spokesman suggested that although it was important still to balance the books, the government understands people are ""weary"" after years of the limit. Public sector pay cap 'under review' And, in line with Michael Fallon and Chris Grayling's comments, the government is ready to listen to the case to ""scrap the cap"" - bringing a potential end to the policy that was designed to save Â£5bn for the public purse by 2020. By teatime however, after the Treasury had slightly less enthusiastically said they were ""open to discussion"", that nurse, social worker, teacher or doctor had slightly less cause for feeling optimistic about a bigger pay rise any time soon. Number 10 had perhaps not changed, but certainly tweaked, their tune - saying when asked repeatedly that the policy has not changed, the independent pay review bodies will report in due course and the government will consider their proposals. So far, so confusing. Neither Number 10 nor the Treasury, who it's suggested were not entirely thrilled with the suggestion,  are ready by the end of this political day to be able to make such a big change, or to give Labour such a big victory. The problem for them however is not just what appears to be a changing mood among some voters, but also very public hints by cabinet members that the cap, becoming painful for some as inflation starts to lift, could disappear along with Theresa May's majority.

Reality Check: Are England terrible at penalty shootouts?,"Reality Check verdict:Yes, England are terrible at penalty shootouts, and the senior men's team has the worst record in the world. England's under-21s lost their European Championship semi-final against Germany on Tuesday,4-3 on penalties. It brought back memories of previous penalty defeats by England, which may give the impression that the country is not very good at shootouts. That impression is confirmed by a look at the data. England's senior men's team, senior women's team and men's under-21s have a record of won two, lost 12. Penalty shootouts were introduced in the 1976 European Championships and the 1978 World Cup. But England's men did not take part in one until 1990. The senior men were knocked out of the World Cups in 1990, 1998 and 2006 on penalties and the European Championships in 1996, 2004 and 2012. Their only win was against Spain in the quarter-finals of Euro 96, a tournament in which they were beaten on penalties in the semi-finals. No team has lost more penalty shootouts at World Cups and European Championships than England (Italy have lost the same number, but they've won more). Making up the numbers was England's defeat by Belgium on penalties in the King Hassan II International Cup Tournament in Morocco, which as a warm-up before France 98 purists might decide to exclude. Drawn matches were decided by penalties (without extra time) to ensure there would be an eventual winner, although the structure of the tournament was that each of the four teams played only two matches. The senior women have taken part in three shootouts and lost them all. They lost thefinal of the 1984 European Championships to Sweden,external, theplay-off match,externalfor seventh place against China at the complicated Algarve Cup in 2005 and  to France in thequarter-final of the 2011 World Cup. The men's under-21s competed in, and lost, one of the more epic shootouts of all time,13-12 to Holland,externalin the semi-final of the 2007 European Championships - the same stage at which they were knocked out on penalties on Tuesday. But the under-21s do have a penalty shootout win to their names, havingbeaten Sweden 5-4 on penalties,external, also at the semi-final stage, of the European Championships of 2009.

Grenfell residents confront minister,"This video can not be played Many Grenfell residents told the housing minister they wanted ""actions before words"" Residents affected by the Grenfell Tower fire have vented their frustration at what they say is a lack of progress in dealing with problems. They confronted housing minister Alok Sharma MP on why the homeless are not yet rehoused, in tense exchangeson the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme. The minister told them people would be offered a suitable place to live within three weeks of the fire. Later,the Prime Minister confirmed 120 tower blocks had now failed fire tests. Andpolice said 80 people were missing presumed dead, but a true total of those who died may not be known until at least the end of the year. This video can not be played Grenfell resident Oluwaseun Talabi tells minister: 'I want permanent accommodation' During the TV programme, residents and survivors set out their problems in the wake of the 14 June inferno. ""I am not moving my child from here, to here, to here, to here - I want permanent accommodation,"" Oluwaseun Talabi, who escaped the fire with his wife and young daughter, told Mr Sharma. ""I am not going to take any house you give me, it has to be suitable. ""I was happy in my house. I work hard. I want permanent accommodation,"" He and his family have been living in a hotel room after they ""lost everything"". Read the full story here: Grenfell survivor, rebuilding his life See clips from the show, here,external Watch the full programme here Mahad Egal, who escaped the fourth floor of Grenfell Tower duringthe fire in the early hours of 14 June, described how he had been offered alternative accommodation in a high rise block. He has refused it. ""My first priority is to put suitable accommodation over my children and my wife,"" he said. ""These people have the right to get back their dignity. Where is the dignity?""asked survivor Sid-Ali Atmani,external. ""I don't want Theresa (May) to go to the TV, I want her to come (here)."" The group described the practical problems they have faced in being rehoused; trying to replace burned documents; accessing funding; being unable to return to work without a permanent base; and their dealings with the authorities. They also spoke about the psychological impacts. Many said they had not been able to sleep since the disaster, or were haunted by images of their escape and their friends, family and neighbours who perished. Omar Alhajali,whose brother Mohammed died in the blaze, said: ""When I see (his image), I remember everything. Not only now but every night... I can't sleep."" The group were hugely critical of the local council and the government's emergency response. Kensington and Chelsea council provided no spokesperson for the programme's debate and they were empty-chaired. Mr Sharma, the government's housing minister, arrived to answer their questions part-way through the show. Survivors have themselves begun to compile a list of the victims as the current official number of people who died stands at 79, but it is expected to rise. This video can not be played A woman who ran to help residents told the panel: ""Check your moral compass"" They feel it will rise much further and are concerned the number is being downplayed. Other residents have also voiced concerns - nearby blocks of flats and houses still lack hot water. Simone Willis, a nurse who helped victims on the night, addressed a panel of politicians on the programme including the local MP Emma Dent Coad and London Assembly member Tony Devenish, saying: ""When you're coming to these kinds of scenarios asking, 'what is needed?', think! ""You have a family, a mother, daughter, what would you need? ""This is not going to take a few shows, a few meetings, this is years of work."" Mr Sharma said the government guaranteed ""people who have had their homes destroyed will be offered suitable accommodation within three weeks"". That timeframe leaves one week remaining. He initially said that would be ""accommodation"" and later said ""temporary accommodation"". Everybody would have ""good quality accommodation"" he said, inviting them all to tell him their issues. This video can not be played Oluwaseun Talabi talked about his survival as he revisited the tower, two weeks on During the programme, residents raised thequestions about the disasterthey want to see answered by an inquiry. They included: How many people have died? Why did the fire spread so quickly? Will anyone be held to account? Why were people told to stay put? Will residents see the justice they want? Afterwards, Mr Sharma said he wasgoing straight to the Westway emergency relief centre to hold a surgery,externalwith survivors. At Prime Minister's Questions, Theresa May updated MPs on progress in dealing with the aftermath of the disaster. She told MPs cladding on blocks across 37 local authority areas in England had failed tests for combustibility. Given the ""100% failure rate"" she said local authorities had been told to get on with fire checks and any further necessary action. She said 282 good quality temporary accommodation units had been identified, 132 families have had their needs assessed and 65 offers of accommodation had been made so far. She said the lord chief justice would recommend a judge to head the public inquiry soon. As of Wednesday morning, Â£1.25m had been paid to those affected and a further Â£1m would go to local charities and supporting groups, she said.

How do you train to be a tennis umpire?,"On the right lines: Emily McGuinness is following the development course for top umpires of the future A group of people are yelling the word ""out"" as an instructor drops a tennis ball next to a painted white line. Those with the loudest voices and best timing will pass the first stage of the Lawn Tennis Association's (LTA) training course to become an umpire. The courses are held at the National Tennis Centre - a stone's throw, or a mishit forehand, from Richmond Park in south-west London. Anyone can take the test, but only those with some specific qualities pass. Eyesight is obviously important - umpires must have 20/20 vision, corrected or uncorrected. So is knowing the rules of tennis. In the US, the United States Tennis Association has put its rule guide online, with 230 pages of questions such as what to do if a player grunts too loudly or injures their opponent, and where a player should place their towel. Emily McGuinness passed the LTA's line umpire course in 2014 and is now on their development scheme for star umpires of the future. The recruits have set up a WhatsApp group in which they regularly test each other on the rules of the game. Teaching respect: Kris Jaeger-Helton's day job is an engineering professor She says having a loud voice is crucial to being a good umpire. ""It is quite unnatural for most people to shout really loudly, so it takes a while to get into the habit of that."" Umpires need good reaction times because players hate it when an official makes a late call. But they must not be too quick - some aspiring umpires fail the course because they call before the ball lands. Reaction times are particularly useful when tracking a 157 miles per hour serve by the American John Isner, then ducking out of the firing line after making the call. Most umpires have a day job that does not involve being on a tennis court. There are umpires who also work as medical doctors, university professors, priests and a NASA engineer. Father Paul Arinze, a Catholic priest from Wisconsin, US, has umpired matches at Wimbledon, the Australian Open, the US Open, and last year's Olympic Games. He says being used to talking in front of a congregation helps him control his nerves during tennis matches. When players are angrily questioning a call, he can keep his cool. After all, he is a specialist in forgiveness. Fr Arinze, a Catholic priest from Wisconsin, was an umpire at the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro ""I understand how players react in the heat of competition and that they do not mean what they say,"" he says. ""It is important not to make the situation worse - even if you know you are in the right."" Umpires can discipline a player for breaching the rules, and they are given a list of swear words in different languages to listen out for. Players have calmed down since the days when John McEnroe, Jimmy Connors and llie Nastase threw tantrums at an umpire in front of millions of TV viewers. But the job still has its dangers. Earlier this year, Arnaud Gabas ended up in hospital after Canadian player Denis Shapovalovaccidentally struck him with a balland fractured a bone under his left eye. Umpires need total concentration to track the ball over the course of a match. ""I had not realised how much effort it is to focus for that long, it is different to sitting at your desk working on a computer,"" says Ms McGuinness, who also works in marketing for the charity CARE International. Fr Arinze says umpiring has improved his concentration, which helps him to carry out his duties as a priest. Umpires need to keep their concentration and stay calm ""When I counsel someone, they can speak for a long time but I maybe only need to reply to 20% of what they say, and it is important that I do not miss that part,"" he says. If an umpire has a good match, they will barely be noticed by spectators. But there are exceptions. Swedish umpire Mohamed Layani, who is regarded as one of the world's best, has a cult following among tennis fans. His distinctive call of ""fifteen-love"" has even been sampled in a rap song. Global education Historic violin lent by Oxford University to Syrian refugee UN warns 'no progress' in lack of school places Rubbish collector builds library from discarded books Education aid 'stagnates' despite pledges University of Birmingham to open campus in Dubai Apple runs its own school to tackle digital skills gap Get in touch with theGlobal education series. Continuing professional development is an important part of umpiring. Officials are watched every match and given feedback on their performance by more senior umpires. Officials start out as a line judge, and those with the best scores progress to calling the score from the tall umpire's chair. Major tournaments like Wimbledon are hardest to umpire - there are bigger crowds and better players who hit the ball harder and faster. Dr Kris Jaeger-Helton, an engineering professor at Northeastern University in Boston in the United States, rose through the ranks to become a chair umpire alongside her studies. She says she tries to build trust with players and students alike. ""One time, when a player arrived at court and said: 'I'm glad you're doing my match, you always look out for us,' I wanted to bring that tone to the classroom as well,"" she says. Whether in the classroom or officiating a tennis match, ""it is better to conduct the activity rather than to have to be in charge or control it"". She adds that, although training engineers and chairing tennis matches need to be taken seriously, ""sometimes it is okay to lighten up a little"". ""You've got to enjoy what you do and let it show in the balance,"" she says. The Lawn Tennis Association's information aboutbecoming a match official,external.

'Vaccine' created for huge cyber-attack,"Security researchers have discovered a ""vaccine"" for the huge cyber-attack that hit organisations across the world on Tuesday. The creation of a single file can stop the attack from infecting a machine. However, researchers have not been able to find a so-called kill switch that would prevent the crippling ransomware from spreading to other vulnerable computers. Experts are still unsure about the attack's origins or its real purpose. Given that the ransom amount - $300 - was relatively small, some are speculating that the attack may be a front for causing wider disruption or making a political statement. Among the victims of the attack were the Ukrainian central bank, Russian oil giant Rosneft, British advertising firm WPP and the global law firm DLA Piper. Also caught up in the attack was at least one hospital in the US city of Pittsburgh. But for those concerned about the attack there appears to be fix, albeit one with limited effectiveness. By creating a read-only file - named perfc - and placing it within a computer's ""C:\Windows"" folder, the attack will be stopped in its tracks. An explanation of how to do this has beenposted by security news website Bleeping Computer,externaland has been backed up by several other security experts. However, while this method is effective, it only protects the individual computer the perfc file is placed on. Researchers have so far been unable to locate a kill switch that would disable the ransomware attack entirely. Many reports suggest that screens around the world are getting this message showing the ransomware threat ""Even though it will make a machine 'immune',"" explained computer scientist Prof Alan Woodward, ""It is still a 'carrier' (to use the biological analogy). ""It will still act as a platform to spread the ransomware to other machines on the same network."" For the vast majority of users, simply running an up-to-date version of Windows will be sufficient to prevent the attack taking hold, were it to infect your PC. The spread of this new ransomware is likely to be much slower than last month's WannaCry attack, researchers predict, as code analysis showed the new attack did not attempt to spread itself beyond the network it was placed on. Because of this, several experts are predicting that the attack will not spread significantly further than it did on Tuesday, unless it is modified. ""There is low risk of new infections more than one hour after the attack,""suggested the MalwareTech blog,external. So how did it spread? Experts from Cisco's Talos intelligence unit said it believed the attack may have been carried out by exploiting vulnerable accounting software. ""We believe it is possible that some infections may be associated with software update systems for a Ukrainian tax accounting package called MeDoc,"" the companysaid in a blog post,external. MeDoc initially posted an update to its website on Tuesday saying, in Russian, ""Attention! Our server made a virus attack"" - though this was later removed, and the company has since denied its software was exploited. As reported on Tuesday, the method by which victims can pay the ransom fee has been rendered useless. An email address provided by the criminals has been shut down by the hosting provider, while the Bitcoin wallet - where ransoms are deposited - has not been touched. At the time of writing, the wallet contains approximately $8,000-worth of Bitcoin, not a large return for such a significant and widespread attack. These factors contribute to a now-prevailing theory that this was a politically motivated attack on Ukraine, coming as it did just as the country is set to celebrate its Constitution Day. ""This looks like a sophisticated attack aimed at generating chaos, not money,"" said Prof Woodward. ___________ Follow Dave Leeon Twitter @DaveLeeBBC,external You can reach Dave securely through encrypted messaging app Signal on: +1 (628) 400-7370 Global ransomware attack causes turmoil Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser At least two killed and 1,000 structures destroyed as wildfires rage in Los Angeles Watch: Ferocious and explosive fire burns behind CBS reporter Liam Payne cause of death confirmed as UK inquest opens Where is Greenland and why does Trump want it?

Pound jumps on Carney rate rise hint,"The pound jumped nearly 1% after the governor of the Bank of England suggested that interest rates could rise if business investment grows. Sterling rose to $1.2936 against the dollar after Mark Carney said that ""some removal of monetary stimulus is likely to become necessary"". He said a change would depend on whether company investment could offset a slowdown in consumer spending. Mr Carney said it was an issue the Bank ""will debate in the coming months"". Pound Sterling - United States Dollar Last week, at the delayed Mansion House gathering in London, Mr Carney said that ""now is not yet the time to begin"" raising interest rates which remain at a record low of 0.25%. However, shortly afterwards, Bank of England chief economist Andy Haldane said he might vote for a rate rise before the end of the year. The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee was split over raising the interest rate The Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) was split 5-3 to keep rates on hold at its June meeting. The rate of inflation is 2.9% - well above the Bank's target of 2%. In a speech at the ECB central banking forum in Portugal on Wednesday, Mr Carney said: ""Some removal of monetary stimulus is likely to become necessary if the trade-off facing the MPC continues to lessen and the policy decision accordingly becomes more conventional."" He said: ""The extent to which the trade-off moves in that direction will depend on the extent to which weaker consumption growth is offset by other components of demand including business investment, whether wages and unit labour costs begin to firm, and more generally, how the economy reacts to both tighter financial conditions and the reality of Brexit negotiations."" Mr Carney added: ""These are some of the issues that the MPC will debate in the coming months."" Earlier on Wednesday, the Bank's deputy governor,Sir Jon Cunliffe, said it was not the right time to increase borrowing costs. He told BBC Radio 5 live's Wake Up To Money that consumer spending ""is slowing as households' real incomes are squeezed by higher inflation, we expect some of that slowing to be offset by growth in business investment, growth in exports. And I want to see how that plays out"". Sir Jon added: ""We do have to look at what's happening to domestic inflation pressure, and I think that, on the data we have at the moment, gives us a bit of time to see how this evolves.""

French general 'took jet for weekends',"The French air force mainly uses the Alpha Jet for training The French air force is investigating a senior officer said to have used a fighter jet to fly for weekends away. General Richard Reboul flew the Alpha Jet from a training base in Bordeaux in western France to his property in Provence, the Canard EnchaÃ®nÃ© reported. He is also said to have taken a six-seat military transport plane along with a pilot and co-pilot, the satirical newspaper said. Gen Reboul made about 10 trips in total, the newspaper said. The Alpha Jet is a light attack and advanced training aircraft manufactured jointly by Dassault in France and Dornier in Germany. The French air force mostly uses it to train fighter pilots. The distance between Bordeaux and Salon-de-Provence is 470km (290 miles) as the crow flies.

Tax software blamed for cyber-attack,"Microsoft has published some of the ransomware code A global cyber-attack that affected companies around the world may have started via corrupted updates on a piece of accountancy software. Fingers are increasingly pointing to a piece of Ukrainian tax-filing software, MEDoc, as the source of the infection, although the company denies it. Malware generally infiltrates networks via email attachments that users click on in error. Microsoft described the method as ""a recent dangerous trend"". The cyber-attack has caused disruption around the world and infected companies in 64 countries, including banks in Ukraine, Russian oil giant Rosneft, British advertising company WPP and US law firm DLA Piper. Shipping giant Maersk said it was unable to process new orders and was expecting delays to consignments, while one of Europe's largest port operators in Rotterdam said that it had to use manual processes, and Dutch global parcel service TNT said it was operating with restrictions. A Cadbury's factory on the island state of Tasmania ground to a halt when computer systems went down, according to Australian Manufacturing and Workers Union state secretary John Short. Ukraine was hit hardest, suggesting the attack might be politically motivated. According to anti-virus vendor ESET, 80% of all infections were in Ukraine, with Germany second hardest hit with about 9%. This video can not be played Technology explained: what is ransomware? A growing number of security experts, including the British malware expert Marcus Hutchins - credited with ending the WannaCry ransomware outbreak - claim to have logs that reveal MEDoc as the source. In email correspondence with the BBC, Mr Hutchins said: ""It looks like the software's automatic update system was compromised and used to download and run malware rather than updates for the software."" It was not yet clear how it had been compromised, he added. MEDoc has denied the claims, in aFacebook post,external- but in ablog post,externalanalysing how the infection had taken hold on Windows machines, Microsoft also points the finger at the accounting software. ""Active infections of the ransomware initially started from the legitimate MEDoc update process,"" it writes. Alan Woodward, a computer scientist from the University of Surrey, said: The ironic thing about this situation (if it proves to be the case) is that we always advise users to keep their software up to date, ideally using automated updates. ""However, it assumes hackers can't take over the update process and misuse it. ""This process is normally a very tightly controlled process, so this is unusual. ""I can imagine many vendors are now triple-checking to make sure they don't end up being an attack vector."" He said that it showed ""hackers will probe every possible channel"" to find a route into systems. ""As users there isn't a lot we can do as we are in the hands of the software vendors."" 'Vaccine' created for huge cyber-attack Global ransomware attack causes turmoil The malware hall of fame As to how the infection spread beyond Ukraine, he added: ""I wouldn't mind betting that a lot of these multinationals such as Maersk and Merck had this software installed."" Mikko Hypponen, a security expert at F-Secure, has studied the recruitment pages of many of the companies affected and found that some did indeed use the MeDoc software. ""If you do business in Ukraine, the software appears to be de facto,"" he said. There were other anomalies in the attack that pointed to it having been targeted, said Prof Woodward. ""The software was sophisticated, but the attackers only provided one single email address and that was closed down very quickly so it is difficult not to conclude that this wasn't about money but targeted at Ukraine or those doing business with it,"" he said. A Kremlin spokesman said that the malware attack had caused no serious damage in Russia. ""Protection systems have been quite effective both at state and corporate levels,"" said presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov. He added that the origin of the attack remained unclear. Most security experts agree that the virus, thought to be a new variant of the Petya ransomware, was spread using a Windows vulnerability known as Eternal Blue, discovered by the National Security Agency and leaked online. Mr Hypponen told the BBC that it was ""completely clear"" that hackers in both WannaCry and Petya outbreaks had used the NSA exploit. The fact that it had now been leaked and was being used by criminal or political hackers was ""a nightmare scenario"" for the intelligence agency, he said. ""It chose to use the exploit, not tell Microsoft about it and weaponise it, and now it has been leaked, made public and used in an attack,"" he said. The NSA has not publicly acknowledged that its tools have been used in any hacking attacks, but it has not denied it either. Typically ransomware spreads via email, with the aim of fooling recipients into clicking on malware-laden files that cause a PC's data to become scrambled before making a blackmail demand. But other ransomware, including Wannacry, has also spread via ""worms"" - self-replicating programs that spread from computer to computer hunting for vulnerabilities they can exploit. The current attack is thought to have worm-like properties. Several experts believe that one way it breaches companies' cyber-defences is by hijacking an automatic software updating tool used to upgrade an tax accountancy program. Once it has breached an organisation, it uses a variety of means to spread internally to other computers on the same network. One of these is via the so-called EternalBlue hack - an exploit thought to have been developed by US cyberspies, which takes advantage of a weakness in a protocol used to let computers and other equipment talk to each other, known as the Server Message Block (SMB). Another is to steal IT staffs' credentials and then make use of two administrative tools: PsExec, a program that allows software installations and other tasks to be carried out remotely; and WMIC (Windows Management Instrumentation Command-line) a program that allows PCs to be controlled by typing in commands rather than via a graphical-interface. Once a PC is infected, the malware targets a part of its operating system called the Master File Table (MFT). It is essential for the system to know where to find files on the computer. The advantage of doing this rather than trying to encrypt everything on the PC is the task can be achieved much more quickly. Then between 10 to 60 minutes later, the malware forces a reboot of the computer, which then informs the user it is locked and requires a payment for them to get a decryption key.

The show searching for the soul of England's men,"Fatherland has been created using interviews with men about their dads The 2009 children's film Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs was a zany and fun animation. So how did it inspire a theatre project attempting to take stock of masculinity in 21st Century England? Along with his Spray-On Shoes and Hair-Un-Balder, the Monkey Thought Translator was one of madcap inventor Flint Lockwood's greatest creations. As well as letting the film's characters hear what Steve the monkey was thinking, the contraption was put on the head of Flint's emotionally inarticulate dad to allow his son to hear his inner thoughts. ""This invention gets put on this man and he spoke beautifully and honestly about his son,"" recalls theatre director Scott Graham. ""It's a great little film."" The Monkey Thought Translator in action in Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs That scene inspired Graham to embark on his own project asking men to talk honestly about their dads, and dads to talk about their sons, in the hope of getting an insight into the state of fatherhood and masculinity. Graham, who is the artistic director of the Frantic Assembly theatre company, enlisted award-winning playwright Simon Stephens and Underworld musician Karl Hyde. Together, the trio tried to tap into the often-unspoken emotions that lie beneath blokeish bonhomie. The resulting interviews have been turned into a theatre show, Fatherland, for the Manchester International Festival, which opens on Thursday. Left-right: Karl Hyde, Simon Stephens and Scott Graham The three men decided to go back to their home towns to conduct the interviews. Stephens is from Stockport, Greater Manchester, Hyde is from near Kidderminster in Worcestershire and Graham is from Corby, Northamptonshire. They interviewed their own dads, old school friends and strangers - but had to find a way to drill beneath the usual surface small talk. This is how Stephens describes an average conversation: ""I was talking to a really dear friend of mine and there's so much I want to say to him and end up saying nothing, 'All right mate, how's it going? What you up to? Nice one. See you later'. And all those questions sit on this volcano of feeling."" The best way to get men to open up was to make their interviews feel artificial and staged, they decided. Not just everyday chats. So their interviewees wore headphones, plugged into recording equipment. Their own Monkey Thought Translator. Simon Stephens won a Tony Award in 2015 for The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time Stephens has written about father-son relationships in plays like The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night Time, On the Shore of the Wide World and Herons. His own dad died at the age of 59. He says ""the artificiality of the situation"" helped when interviewing his stepdad for Fatherland. ""I was confronting the volcano with my stepdad, talking to my stepdad about his dad's death. My stepdad raised his biological children as a single father and [I was] talking to him about what it was like the moment his wife left him. ""I really love my stepdad but I mainly talk to him about Manchester United. ""So that artificiality was really exposing and really tender as well."" Karl Hyde is also one half of dance duo Underworld Hyde, 60, a dance music pioneer in the 1990s and beyond, took his two collaborators to see his mum and dad. ""It was very strange to be sat there with recording equipment attached to my dad with a pair of headphones on and my two friends sat on my mum's sofa,"" he says. ""And then they ask him, after he's been very chatty, 'What's your earliest memory of your father?' And he replies, 'I don't want to answer that'. ""I'm sat there thinking, 'Woah, what don't I know after all these years? These two guys have just unearthed something that's been lying dormant all my life and I don't know'."" Whatever Hyde's father didn't want to talk about must have been worse than some of the ""real horrors"" from his life that he was willing to discuss, the musician says. Months later, back at his mum and dad's house, another thought struck him. ""Whatever had happened, he'd protected his children from it. He's carrying it with him to this day and he won't let that infect his children. And I think that's amazing. ""Those are the kind of characteristics [we found]. People who are prepared to say, 'This is not good enough for the way we want our children and our friends and families to live, so that's enough of that'."" Manchester International Festival on the BBC After speaking to lots of men about their upbringings, Graham was surprised to find how many were ""genuine survivors of a very difficult situation"". That's not only true of men, of course. ""That there's so much trauma in everybody's everyday life and the way that we challenge it and rise above it is incredibly heroic,"" he says. ""I don't think that's purely a masculine thing. It's constantly surprising, constantly inspiring."" Tachia Newall (left) and Eddie Kay are among the cast of Fatherland Stories from the interviews have been woven into the show, with actors portraying the men the trio met. Snippets of speech are also used in the music, composed by Hyde and Matthew Herbert. But Hyde, Stephens and Graham didn't just interview other people - they also interviewed each other. So they too are played by actors on stage. What did they learn about men and themselves during their interviews? Stephens says: ""In drama, characters don't learn anything new - rather a truth which they've known for a long time is revealed and articulated."" Referring to himself, Stephens adds: ""I think [I learned about] my relationship with my dad's drinking. The extent to which I write out of fear that I might become an alcoholic. ""The extent to which I write out of fear that I might die before I'm 60. The extent to which I am unapologetically a middle class man from a suburb. I could go on."" What started as a journey to the heart of England has become a somewhat unsettling step into their own emotional hinterlands. Stephens later says they did build up a bigger picture of the nation too. He says that through the men they interviewed, they found a country that's ""capable of bravery and kindness and compassion and defiance"", and says that's been proven by the reactions to recent tragic events in London and Manchester. ""Weirdly, it's become a celebration of how good this country can be,"" he says of the show. ""It's been difficult to be English and to talk about how good the English have been until the last two months and then all of a sudden, with the events up the road [Manchester Arena] and London Bridge and Westminster and then Grenfell and Finsbury Park, actually the English are great. ""And I don't mean in a nationalistic way. I mean there is a dignity and a brilliance to the English that is really beautiful. That's what I found when I went on the road with these guys.""

Arrests in UK over Microsoft scam calls,"Many victims of such IT support scams are elderly Four people have been arrested in the UK following an investigation into scams involving calls from fraudsters pretending to be IT support staff. It follows two years of work by City of London Police and Microsoft, who teamed up to tackle the problem. The perpetrators commonly pretend to be phoning on behalf of the US company. The inquiry indicated that many of the calls originated in India but two men and two women in England have been accused of involvement. They include a 29-year-old man and a 31-year-old woman from Woking in Surrey, who were arrested on suspicion of fraud. Both have been bailed. A 37-year-old man and a 35-year-old woman were arrested in South Shields, Tyneside, on suspicion of fraud. Both were released pending further inquiries. There were 34,504 computer software service fraud reports made to the UK's national fraud and cyber-reporting centre, Action Fraud, over the past financial year. This video can not be played Simon Greaves, who lost Â£1,200 to one IT scam, recounts how he was duped The scammers usually declare that they have detected a fault with their target's PC and fool victims into giving them remote access to it. They then often install images that appear to show the computer is infected or install malware themselves. Finally, they demand a fee to fix the issue or otherwise convince the victim to share their bank account details. Sometimes the target is then contacted again at a later date from someone claiming to work for the same service, who says they are due a refund. If they hand over their bank details again, further money is taken from their account. Inside the TalkTalk 'scam call centre' Tech support scams target victims via their ISP PC scams net con artists $1.5bn In addition to Microsoft, criminals have claimed to have worked for BT and TalkTalk among others. Action Fraud says the average age of victims is 62 and they typically pay out Â£600. ""These arrests are just the beginning of our work, making the best use of specialist skills and expertise from Microsoft, local police forces and international partners to tackle a crime that often targets the most vulnerable in our society,"" said Commander Dave Clark from City of London Police. Microsoft has alsopublished advice online,externalfor how to avoid being scammed and what to do if you suspect you have been fooled in the past but may not have realised it until now. ""We'd also like to reassure all users of Microsoft software that we will never cold call you out of the blue or use tech support pop ups on websites,"" added the firm's UK director of legal affairs Hugh Milward. Once scammers gain access to a computer they can install malware or steal information Michael from London, who is 68, was targeted by a scammer in October. ""I got a phone call out of the blue,"" he told the BBC. ""The man said he was officially appointed by Microsoft and wanted to confirm I had been having problems with my laptop. ""I said I had been, and he said he could help to sort it out. ""He seemed to have a lot of information about the fact I had been having problems - he said I had been experiencing issues over the last few months, but he might have been guessing. ""He asked for remote access to my computer and connected in - and then showed me what seemed to be a list of incidents where I had been having computer problems. ""He kept me on the phone for as long as he could - at least an hour. ""At the end of the call, he told me what it would cost. He wanted a few hundred pounds and for me to sign a running service contract - there was no way I was going to pay that. ""I was surprised by how much he seemed to know about the problems I was having, that's why I was taken in by it. ""I think I was naive to give him remote access, although I'm very pleased I didn't pay. ""I did, however, discover that an email stored on the computer contained the password that I had used for all my accounts. ""So, I've changed my passwords and now use a different one for each service."" Man loses Â£1,200 to tech con-artists.

Paolo Nutini cleared of drink-driving,"Nutini claimed he drank whisky after driving home Singer Paolo Nutini has been found not guilty of driving under the influence of alcohol in his home town of Paisley. The 30-year-old had denied driving while more than twice the legal limit on 21 February. The Scottish songwriter had used ""the hip flask defence"", which suggested he had drunk alcohol after he had driven. A Scottish Police Authority forensic toxicologist had told the trial that ""post-incident drinking"" could increase alcohol readings. During a two-day trial at Paisley Sheriff Court, witness Colin May told the court he saw Nutini driving after ordering vodka in DeBeers bar. PC Laura Murray told the first day of the trial she was called to Canal Street towards midnight on 21 February to a report of a car being driven by someone who had allegedly been drinking. The car was no longer there when they arrived but they went to an address where they found a grey Mini and Nutini, who they had been told was the driver of the vehicle. After testing positive for alcohol following a breath test, Nutini was arrested and taken to Govan police station. Asked whether he mentioned drinking after returning home, she said: ""He said he had had a mouthful of wine at home and this later changed to saying he had a mouthful of whisky."" The court heard Nutini had a reading of 48 microgrammes of alcohol in 100ml of breath - more than double the 22mcg legal limit. Giving evidence, forensic toxicologist Karen Kerr had told the court she did a number of calculations on the alcohol level in Nutini's system. She explained the amount Nutini claimed he had drunk after driving would account for 31mcg. She said: ""It's saying, had post-incident drinking not taken place, the result would have been 17[mcg] - it's in terms of the hip flask defence. ""The 17 would've been caused by any other pre-incident drinking - drinking prior to the evidential result."" She said the results of the breath test did not fit with his claims about how much he had to drink on the night in question but she conceded he may have been fit to drive at the time he was driving. ""It is possible he would've been under the limit [22mcg] at the time of driving,"" she said. ""He could be as high as 36[mcg] or as low as 14[mcg]. ""I couldn't get 48[mcg] to lie within the range, based on the stated pattern of drinking."" Sheriff Colin Pettigrew acquitted the musician and Nutini left the court without comment. Nutini's debut album, These Streets, was released in 2006 and peaked at number three on the UK Albums Chart, while the follow-up, 2009's Sunny Side Up, debuted at number one. Both albums were certified quintuple platinum and his third album, 2014-release Caustic Love, was also certified platinum after going to number one.

"The Grenfell survivor rebuilding his life, two weeks on","This video can not be played Olu feared he and his family would be killed in the fire Two weeks ago, Olu was preparing to climb down from the 14th floor of Grenfell Tower on a makeshift rope of tied-together bed sheets, with his daughter on his back. Thankfully, he survived, after firefighters told him to run to safety - but what does his life hold now? ""My life wasn't perfect, but I was happy with it,"" Oluwaseun Talabi tells theBBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme, reflecting on times before the fire. When Grenfell Tower set alight, in the early hours of Wednesday 14 June, Olu was in his flat, where he lived with his partner and four-year-old daughter. He was awoken by screams of ""fire! fire!"" from his neighbours. ""We tried to run out of the house. But the first thing that hit us was this massive thick smoke, so we shut the door straight away,"" he says. Olu began creating another escape route - tying bed sheets together in the hope of climbing down the outside of the building. Desperate to save his four-year-old daughter, he then tied her - using cloths - to his back. His intentions were broken only by the entrance of firefighters. They had earlier moved five other residents into his room. Now, they told Olu to run to safety. ""I grabbed my missus, and I just went for it,"" he says. ""When I got in that smoke, I thought I was going to die. I thought I wouldn't make it down those stairs. ""My daughter is choking, I'm choking, my partner is falling down the stairs - I'm trying to hold her hand,"" he says, recalling his frantic search for the exit. ""I do not know how we made it down there."" The charred remains of where Olu used to call home Olu now feels very fortunate that he - and his family - survived. He says he thinks of those that died every night. Scared of the dark, he sleeps with the television on to light up the room. He says it stops him from seeing those that died. Asked if he has been offered mental health support, he responds: ""I think I need help."" Several days after the fire, Olu - who is staying at a hotel with his family - is surprisingly keen to return to the west London tower block. ""I just want to see what I've come out from,"" he says. As he walks through the streets in the surrounding area, he sees ""missing"" posters for his neighbours - many of whom he knew. ""I know Steve, he lived on the 15th floor - a very nice guy. We were always chatting and bumping into one another,"" he says, looking at one of the images plastered on the brickwork of a pillar of a nearby bridge. Posters and written tributes line a pillar near Grenfell Tower ""Everyone loved him, the whole community loved him,"" he says, speaking of another. But it is a third image that affects him the most, taking him aback. It is a photo of Zainab Deen - one of the residents firefighters placed in his flat - and her two-year-old son Jeremiah. Olu battles to find the words. ""This little kid here,"" he says, pointing to Jeremiah - who has been missing since the fire - ""now he's gone"". Zainab and her son Jeremiah are listed among the missing Of the other three people placed in Olu's flat, Syrian refugee Mohammed Alhajali died after being separated from his brother Omar - who was also in the flat, and survived. Denis Murphy, 56, is still missing. His family say they last heard from him in the early hours of Wednesday sometime between 01:30 and 02:00. Soon after, Olu sees a poster of another resident, a woman named Debbie, who he did not know was missing. ""Wow, I feel funny, man. Wow,"" he says, raw with emotion, as he visibly struggles to digest the news. Watch theVictoria Derbyshire programmeon weekdays between 09:00 and 11:00 on BBC Two and the BBC News channel. After a few minutes, Olu says he is ready to continue the walk to Grenfell Tower. As he turns the corner, he sees what is left of his home for the first time. ""I can smell it. It brings back the memories,"" he says. ""It looks like something out of Syria. I guarantee there's dead bodies in there right now."" For Olu, seeing the building is part of the healing process - to somehow make sense of what happened that night. ""I think it would actually make me happy if I could go in there - but I know it's not possible."" This is the first time Olu has been back to Grenfell Tower since the fire Olu is now keen to start rebuilding his life. He has been left with no possessions, and no home. He is clearly exhausted, on occasion struggling to walk, but is visiting local centres that provide money, clothes, food and drink to survivors - using donations from the public. Olu, however, is understandably keen to regain his independence - and provide for his family. ""I don't want to have to keep coming back here for money,"" he says, outside one of the centres. ""I'm happy that people are willing to help us, but I'm a hardworking guy. ""We don't want to feel like a charity case."" Large numbers of donations were left for the survivors of the Grenfell Tower fire The most important thing for Olu now is to find a suitable new home. He recently turned down an offer to be re-housed, because it was too far from his daughter's school. He is trying to stay upbeat, however, and describes himself as a ""naturally positive guy"". He hopes to go back to university to finish a master's degree in construction management. But perhaps the more pressing concern is to find some time to escape recent events, to digest all that has happened. ""I think I need to get away from all of this. Maybe just a little holiday or something,"" he says. PM calls for tower cladding investigation Cladding firm ends sales for tower blocks Grenfell husband: I can't do that to her.

The strange things people put in luggage,"As people jet off for their summer holidays, the question of what you can and can't carry in your luggage is more pressing than ever - especially for those attempting to carry live creatures or unexploded mementoes of war. It's the age-old problem - you're overseas on a trip, you treat yourself to that large lobster you've always promised yourself, and you need to get it home. What do you do now? For one passenger at Boston's Logan International Airport, the answer was simply to check it in as part of their luggage allowance. The US Transportation Security Administrationhas now tweeted a picture of it.,externalas they were so impressed by its size.But as it was checked in using a suitable container,,externalit was allowed to fly. But not everyone does things by the book - a man returning home to China was found witha live lobster in his hand luggage,externalin March last year. He'd travelled from Australia via Hong Kong, and somehow had managed to get his cargo as far as his returning airport in Ningbo, in the east of the country, before officials stepped in and confiscated it. The month before that, two women werefilmed in Hong Kong,externalstuffing live lobsters into a holdall. The fate of the creatures, and the women's destination, is not known, but it seems likely that they were destined for a journey of some kind - with no suitable container in sight. Unexploded artillery shells still turn up in northern France, and in Eurostar luggage It's not just live things that cause consternation at security checkpoints - the Eurostar has a consistent problem with people trying to bring unexploded shells from both world wars onto its trains. They're found in France and then attempts are made to bring them over to the UK. There have been so many instances of this thatin May 2015 the BBC did a round-upof shell-collectors bringing trains to a halt. And so it goes on, with people still trying to carry old explosives under the Channelevery now and then. London City Airport commissioned a report last year,externalthat found 13% of people in the UK have had to give up an item of hand luggage because it flouted the rules. Its report also said that two pairs of fluffy handcuffs are confiscated by London City Airport staff every month on average. Tourists who treat themselves to a London snow globe can't carry it in their hand luggage Top of the report's confiscated list is snow globes, commonly depicting landmarks from the capital. These break the rule on not transporting more than 100ml of liquid on board a flight in hand luggage. Also on the airport's banned list are potato forks for fondue sets - because they could be used as a weapon. A year ago,Essex Police tweeted photographs,externalof an iPhone case that looked like a gun, which caused a bit of consternation at Stansted Airport. In 2010,Cardiff Airport released a list of itemsthat people had been stopped with. These included a palm tree in a sand bag, a briefcase full of bricks, two unpacked armchairs and a 10lb frozen turkey. When security staff asked the passenger about the turkey, they replied: ""Why are you making a fuss - will it thaw at 30,000ft?"" The man was told it was illegal to take perishable foodstuffs abroad without proper permission. Turkeys are great in an oven, not so good in your suitcase Cardiff Airport says that it ""hasn't had anything too unusual"" of late, but does often prevent ""home comfort foods"" such as butter - which is classed as a liquid. Also tinned foods like peaches have been prevented from going aboard aircraft. Other items that aren't allowed in hold luggagewhen boarding a plane in the UK,externalinclude the following: Lighters (although you can carry one on board) Fireworks Matches E-cigarettes (but allowed in hand luggage) Vehicle batteries Mace or pepper spray Imitation explosive devices (including replica or model guns) At least two killed and 1,000 structures destroyed as wildfires rage in Los Angeles Watch: Ferocious and explosive fire burns behind CBS reporter Liam Payne cause of death confirmed as UK inquest opens Where is Greenland and why does Trump want it?

Birdwatchers flock to see bee-eaters,"This video can not be played About a hundred people have been to the quarry since Sunday Birdwatchers have rushed to a quarry to catch a glimpse of seven ""exotic"" birds that are usually seen in southern Europe. Bee-eaters, which are rare visitors to the UK, have been spotted at the Cemex quarry, in East Leake, Nottinghamshire. The RSPB said the birds, which feast on bees and wasps, have been seen mating and it is likely they will nest at the site. The birds may have headed north due to climate change, the charity added. Live updates from the East Midlands Many more birdwatchers are expected to visit the quarry at the weekend About a hundred birdwatchers have been to the site since Sunday, but that number is expected to increase significantly by the weekend. A viewing area and car park, with a Â£5 charge, has been set up at Lings Farm, near Loughborough, for birders seeking the best views of the bee-eaters. The Nottinghamshire Wildlife Trust, which works in partnership with minerals firm Cemex, said it was the first record of the species in the county since 1970. The birds have to be viewed at distance through binoculars and digiscopes so they are not disturbed It is extremely rare that bee-eater birds attempt to breed in the UK Tim Sexton, from the trust, said bee-eaters prefer to nest in sandy banks and the quarry simulates those conditions. ""It creates quite a nice safe haven for the birds, but certainly over the past 20 years we've seen species you would typically associate with the Mediterranean, the south of France and even North Africa,"" he added. ""Perhaps [in the future] we'll see bee-eaters become a common sight across Nottinghamshire and further north as well."" A car park has been set up and half of the proceeds will go to the RSPB Mark Thomas, from the RSPB, said: ""Bee-eater sightings have been on the increase. Pushed northwards by climate change, these exotic birds will likely become established visitors to our shores."" The last time the birdsnested in the UK was in Cumbria in 2015, and they have also nested on theIsle of Wight in 2014, Herefordshire in 2005 and Country Durham in 2002. The bee-eaters have been taking advantage of the quarry's sandy banks Bee-eaters Bee-eaters are normally found nesting in southern Europe and are a very rare breeding bird in the UK They nest in colonies in sandy banks often near rivers The birds can burrow in 10ft (3m) tunnels and usually lay clutches of four to nine eggs Bee-eaters are a schedule one species, which means that intentional or reckless disturbance of their nests is a criminal offence The birds are expected to increase in numbers in the UK due to climate change, the RSPB said Source:RSPB,external Thousands flock to see bee-eaters Rarely seen birds breeding on island Second 'rare' bird in Sunderland The RSPB Nottinghamshire Wildlife Trust Stars including Ricky Gervais and Dame Judi Dench need help of Worksop residents to speed up ban on trophy hunting imports in Parliament Â£5.4million Nottingham College centre for supported learners now complete Desperate Mansfield drug addict stole Â£8k after accessing employerâs online banking app Sutton drink driver who crashed into parked car was FOUR times over the limit Jail for Worksop hooligan who stamped on fanâs head and hurled man onto tracks at Retford train station Newark: Events mark 400 years since King Charles Iâs accession to throne At least two killed and 1,000 structures destroyed as wildfires rage in Los Angeles Watch: Ferocious and explosive fire burns behind CBS reporter Liam Payne cause of death confirmed as UK inquest opens Where is Greenland and why does Trump want it?

Each DUP MP 'worth more than Ronaldo',"This video can not be played Glasgow MP Alison Thewliss questioned the Â£1bn deal signed between the Tories and the DUP Each Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) MP is now ""worth more"" than Cristiano Ronaldo, a Scottish National Party MP has told the House of Commons. Alison Thewliss made the remark as she questioned the Tory government about the Â£1bn deal they signed with the DUP. But her comparison of the 10 DUP MPs with theworld's third most expensive footballerled to roars of laughter. ""We're now in the slightly odd position where each DUP MP is worth more than Ronaldo,"" Ms Thewliss said. ""I don't know what it says about their footballing skills."" NI secretary warns over talks deadline DUP-Tory deal secures extra NI spending Under the dealannounced on Monday, DUP MPs will support the government in exchange for extra public spending in Northern Ireland. Ms Thewliss wanted to know how the Conservative government could act with impartiality between unionists and Irish nationalists in Northern Ireland, given its dependence on the support of the DUP. Manchester United sold Cristiano Ronaldo to Real Madrid in 2009 for Â£80m The Glasgow Central MP addressed her concerns to Northern Ireland Secretary of State James Brokenshire during the first Northern Ireland Questions session of the new parliament. ""Does the secretary of state agree with Jonathan Powell that is it now impossible for the UK government to be even-handed in Northern Ireland?"" she asked. Mr Powell was intimately involved in the Northern Ireland peace process during his 10-year tenure as chief-of-staff to the former Prime Minister Tony Blair. Mr Brokenshire, who had already answered several questions that raised the same concern about government impartiality, simply replied: ""No I don't."" This week's agreement between the DUP and the Conservative Party was signed in Downing Street after 11 days of negotiations. The extra spending was given a cautious welcome by parties in Northern Ireland. However, the deal was criticised by senior politicians in Scotland, Wales and some English regions who argued that their jurisdictions would suffer as a result of preferential treatment given to Northern Ireland. The Scottish National Party MP was not the first to cry foul with a football analogy. Jim Pickard, chief political correspondent with the Financial Times, tweeted some record-breaking transfer fees on Monday, by way of comparison to the DUP price tag. He pointed out that the almost Â£1bn committed by the government to secure the support of the party's 10 MPs works out at about Â£100m each. Mr Pickard later added: ""Did I mention they played on the right wing?"" Manchester United sold Cristiano Ronaldo to Real Madrid in 2009 for Â£80m, a record which has since been surpassed by transfer fees for Gareth Bale and Paul Pogba.

Has al-Muhajiroun been underestimated?,"One of the London Bridge attackers was a follower of the banned al-Muhajiroun network. But has the UK been guilty of not taking the Islamist group seriously enough? The man in a white robe with the microphone at the front of the hall addressed his audience of al-Muhajiroun supporters. Even with cameras there, he didn't hold back. ""When Tony Blair came out, George Bush came out at the same time and he said: 'Are you with us or you're with the terrorists?' What did we Muslims say?"" He paused for effect. ""We're not with you, we're with theâ¦ terrorists."" The audience finished his sentence for him and cries of Allahu Akbar [God is great] echoed around the room. It was April 2004 and I'd been invited to film at an al-Muhajiroun meeting at a community hall in Bethnal Green in east London. I was following a convert to Islam called Sulayman Keeler - born Simon Keeler - for a film I was making for Newsnight. The next speaker was no less extreme. Abu Uzair, real name Sajid Sharif, took the microphone. The engineering graduate from Manchester launched into one of al-Muhajiroun's favourite topics - the 9/11 attacks on America. Abu Uzair defends the 9/11 attack at an al-Muhajiroun meeting in 2004 ""When the two planes magnificently run through those buildingsâ¦ people say, 'hang on a second, that is barbaric. Why did you have to do that?' You know why? Because of ignorance."" At this point, I put my hand up to interrupt, asking him how it could be justifiable to call the killing of innocent people in the Twin Towers ""magnificent"". Abu Uzair replied: ""For us it's retaliation."" I pressed on: ""But the killing of innocent civilians can't be right."" Jabbing his finger at me, Abu Uzair answered: ""It can't be right according to you. According to Islam it's right. Do you not kill innocent civilians in Afghanistan?"" ""I wouldn't call that magnificent,"" I ventured. Abu Uzair replied: ""Islamically speaking it's magnificent."" And with that exchange, the extreme, aggressive ideology of al-Muhajiroun became clear. It was a message of defiance, of hate. No compromise. For them Islam was at war with the West. They knew our camera was rolling but they were justifying violence. This was a year before the London bombings on 7 July 2005 that claimed 52 lives. The BBC understands that Abu Uzair has never faced legal action in the UK. He gave this lecture 13 years ago. The legal picture has changed now. New laws ban the glorification of terrorism and there've been many more successful prosecutions over the past decade. After the Manchester Arena bomb attack last month, MI5 let it be known that the scale of the threat from militant Islamists is huge. Some 3,000 people in the UK are assessed to have current links to violent Islamist extremism, with another 20,000 assessed to have had recent links. That makes for a longlist of 23,000 people - the population of a small town. Radical preacher Omar Bakri Muhammad, pictured in 1996 The fact that al-Muhajiroun was allowed to recruit in towns across the UK for years, largely unfettered by the state, is part of the picture. The group was the creation of the extremist preacher Omar Bakri Muhammad. Born in Syria, he was expelled in 1977 for his anti-Baath Party views and travelled to Lebanon where he joined Islamist group Hizb ut-Tahrir. Their aim was to create a single Islamic State - a caliphate - across the entire Middle East and, eventually, the world. After a brief stay in Egypt, Bakri Muhammad settled in Mecca in Saudi Arabia. In 1983, he created a new group there called Jamaat al-Muhajiroun. The name means ""the community of the emigrants"". In 1986, Bakri Muhammad's extreme Islamist views and connections to the banned Hizb ut-Tahrir led the Saudis to expel him. He fled to the UK where he was given asylum. He immediately created a UK branch of Hizb ut-Tahrir and began an aggressive recruitment drive among young British Muslims. In the UK, Bakri Muhammad's sermons called for the black flag of Islam to be hoisted over Downing Street and for a global caliphate. The next decade was spent peddling his narrative - that Muslims were the victims of international conspiracies, that Sharia [Islamic law] must come to the UK. But Hizb ut-Tahrir's international leadership grew tired of the man who would become known as the Tottenham Ayatollah, a reference to his office in north London. His focus on the UK was seen as a distraction from the wider goal of establishing a caliphate across the Middle East. He was expelled from the party in 1996. And that prompted him to set up a new group in the UK - al-Muhajiroun. In the late 1990s, Bakri Muhammad toured towns and cities with large Muslim populations in a recruitment drive for his new group. He was largely unchallenged by the British state, which had been preoccupied by the threat posed by Irish republican groups. 2002: A demonstrator at an al-Muhajiroun event in London They dismissed Bakri Muhammad as a fool. In the wider community, few realised how divisive and dangerous his views were. Over the years, I've spent a lot of time in Crawley, investigating terrorism for the BBC. With its well-kept houses and leafy streets, this Sussex new town seems an unlikely recruiting ground for jihad. But some of the UK's most notorious Islamists were born there. Three of those later convicted of planning to detonate a huge fertiliser bomb in 2004 grew up in the town. The leader of the plot, Omar Khyam, had strong links with al-Muhajiroun. Jawad Akbar and Omar Khyam (r) were given life sentences in 2007 for plotting bomb attacks Omar Khyam and another of the fertiliser bomb plotters, Jawad Akbar, both attended Hazelwick secondary school in the town. At one point Bakri Muhammad managed to get himself invited to talk to sixth formers there. The headteacher of Hazelwick school at that time was Gordon Parry. ""At the time our involvement with him was simply to promote religious tolerance and understanding and inclusivity,"" he says. ""I will put my hand up now and say that was an utterly naÃ¯ve thing to do. But at the time I didn't understand what he represented."" Fast-forward to 2017 and the terror attack at London Bridge had a strong link with al-Muhajiroun. The attack leader Khuram Butt was a supporter of the network, even appearing in a Channel 4 documentary last year called The Jihadis Next Door. Police officers on the scene after the London Bridge terror attack on 3 June Butt didn't exactly hide his extremist sympathies, and this raises a huge question for the British state - was the threat posed by radicals linked to al-Muhajiroun underestimated for years? One senior former government adviser on the threat from terrorism certainly thinks it was. Richard Kemp was chairman of the Cobra Intelligence Group at the time of the London bombings in 2005. He was responsible for co-ordinating intelligence from the Security Service MI5 and the Secret Intelligence Service MI6, reporting to the secret Cobra committee that briefs the government on national security at times of crisis. Col. Richard Kemp: ""We've been far too tolerant of al-Muhajiroun"" ""We've been far too tolerant of al-Muhajiroun,"" says Kemp. Their use of abusive language and threats was not tackled, he suggests. ""It was a major failure and we've seen the consequences - we've seen Lee Rigby [murdered] by a follower of al-Muhajiroun, we've seen numerous attacks around the world."" Kemp, also a former commander of British armed forces in Afghanistan, says there was a certain amount of complacency about al-Muhajiroun, both in the intelligence community and in successive governments. ""There was a real failure politically and among the police and intelligence services to understand the way this situation was going to develop."" There was a period of inaction on the part of the authorities before 9/11 - but also after - that was extremely dangerous, Kemp believes. The 9/11 attack on New York's World Trade Center ""The networks and the individuals involved in them saw that we were weak. They saw that we wanted to appease them and we wanted to let them continue and they exploited that - in terms of developing and building a network. ""There was an element of complacency among those people who were monitoring their activities. I certainly heard words used like 'blowhard' and 'windbag' in relation to some casesâ¦ that we're looking at people who talk a big war but don't actually fight it and don't pose a big threat to the UK."" Peter Clarke, the former head of counter-terrorism at the Metropolitan Police, doesn't agree with this analysis. ""It is easy to say with hindsight that more should have been done sooner to focus on the Islamist threat. This is too simplistic. The Good Friday agreement may have been signed in 1998, but the dissident republicans of the Real IRA were attacking targets on the mainland UK, including the BBC, until 2001. At that time Islamist groups were involved in low-level criminality to raise funds to send back to political organisations in their countries of origin."" Mr Clarke says he never heard the term ""blowhard"" being used. Peter Clarke, former head of counter-terrorism at the Metropolitan Police In 2004 it was clear the threat had escalated. An intercepted electronic communication about perfecting the ingredients for a massive fertiliser bomb prompted a huge counter-terrorism investigation by the police and MI5 - Operation Crevice. This was followed a few months later by another big investigation, Operation Rhyme, to foil a second Islamist bomb plot in the UK. There was a race to investigate these plots, Clarke says. ""These were both intercepted as a result of intensive investigation by MI5 and police, and preceded the 7/7 attacks. So it is not right to say that the Islamist threat was ignored. ""Priorities were chosen according to the threat posed by various groups. After 9/11, Irish terrorist groups pulled back on their activities, allowing a shift in focus towards finding out if Islamists did indeed pose a threat."" The fertiliser bomb plotters - and the 7/7 London bombers who murdered 52 people the following year - also had strong links to al-Muhajiroun. Mohammad Sidique Khan, one of the bombers in the 7/7 London attacks in 2005 By 2004, it was clear that the al-Muhajiroun network had been at the very least a gateway to terror. Al-Muhajiroun and its leaders always played a cat and mouse game with the state. Bakri Muhammad wound up the group in 2004 because he thought it was about to be banned. But the network then launched a series of groups which were, in effect, different names for the same thing. Al-Ghurabaa and the Saviour Sect both emerged in 2005 as splinter groups, and were proscribed in 2006. Other groups created by the same network included Muslims Against Crusades, Islam4UK, Shariah4UK, Call to Submission, Islamic Path, the London School of Sharia, and Need4Khilafah. All of them were proscribed by the government after they emerged. All of these groups can be considered as the al-Muhajiroun network. They all wanted to see Sharia law introduced to the UK by force, do not believe in democracy, and have hostile views about Shia Muslims and other minorities that they claim are consistent with the teachings of the Koran. So why was more not done? This was ideological extremism and the leaders of the network, like Anjem Choudary, were always careful to stay, just, on the right side of the law so they could not be arrested. Anjem Choudary, one of the co-founders of al-Muhajiroun, currently jailed for supporting IS ""No-one knew whether the ideological stance of al-Muhajiroun was going to inevitably lead to violence in this country,"" says Mr Clarke. ""Once the threat from dissident republicans receded, the focus on the Islamist threat grew very quickly. It's also probably fair to say that no-one had before encountered a terrorist threat that was rooted in ideology rather than political goals, that knew no boundaries and for whose adherents capture or death was not a risk but an aspiration."" The British state did take action. Bakri Muhammad was stopped from re-entering the UK after the 7/7 bombings in London in 2005, moving back to Lebanon, where he is serving a prison sentence for terrorism offences today. But his network continued under different names. Flowers left near the spot where serviceman Lee Rigby was murdered in 2013 The network's supporters have been linked to terror plots across the world. And a number of adherents in the UK have been imprisoned. In addition to the five fertiliser bomb plotters - Omar Khyam, Jawad Akbar, Waheed Mahmood, Anthony Garcia and Salahuddin Amin - other followers such as Sulayman Keeler and Abu Izzadeen have been convicted of terror-related offences. Figurehead Anjem Choudary was eventually jailed for five years for inviting support for so-called Islamic State. 2003: Suicide bombing attack on Mike's Place bar in Israel 2004: Fertiliser bomb plot and Operation Rhyme in the UK 2005: London bombings 2013: Murder of Lee Rigby 2014: Suicide bombing attack in Iraq by Waheed Majid 2017: London Bridge attacks This latest connection, between the recent London Bridge terrorist attack and al-Muhajiroun, is likely to feature in the ongoing police investigation. We know Khuram Butt, the attack leader, was a long-term supporter of the group. But if you dig a little further some interesting facts emerge about the gym in east London where he used to train - the Ummah Fitness Centre in Ilford. Khuram Butt, one of the London Bridge attackers, had connections to Al-Muhajiroun Newsnight discovered that a man called Sajeel Shahid applied for planning permission to create a gym for Muslims from warehouse space in 2011. To understand the significance of this, we have to look back to the late 1990s when Omar Bakri Muhammad set up a branch of al-Muhajiroun in Pakistan. Sajeel Shahid is alleged to have helped run the office in Lahore. Just after the 9/11 attack, an American jihadist called Mohammed Junaid Babar joined them. Three years later, he turned against his old friends and became a jihadi ""supergrass"", testifying against people in the al-Muhajiroun network who went on to plan a terror attack in the UK. We obtained a confidential transcript of the FBI's interview with Junaid Babar. In it, Junaid Babar tells the FBI that Sajeel Shahid was the leader of al-Muhajiroun in Pakistan. The document alleges that Junaid Babar said that Sajeel Shahid co-ordinated training for jihadi recruits at a camp in Pakistan where they ""most likely received explosives training"". Junaid Babar also said in court, during the 2007 trial of the fertiliser bomb plotters, that in February 2003 he and Sajeel Shahid had found a good location for weapons training in Pakistan's north-west frontier province near the town of Malakand. The future leader of the fertiliser bomb plot, Omar Khyam, and the future leader of the London 7/7 bombers, Mohammad Siddique Khan, trained there. We tried to contact Sajeel Shahid to ask him about this, but a man answering the phone number we had simply said it was the wrong number and hung up. There's absolutely no suggestion that Sajeel Shahid had a hand in the London Bridge attack, and he has never been charged with any terror-related offence. Sajeel Shahid has previously denied being the leader of al-Muhajiroun in Pakistan and said that he had only been a student in the country. Sajeel Shahid being interviewed by the BBC in London in 2007 The named groups connected with al-Muhajiroun have been proscribed, but the networks of supporters persist. After the recent spate of attacks, Prime Minister Theresa May said ""enough is enough"" and declared her intent to do something about it. But based on the last two decades of various governments failing to get on top of the problem of radicalisation, Richard Kemp remains worried.

Faecal bacteria 'in ice at coffee chains',"Ice from three of the UK's biggest coffee chains has been found to contain bacteria from faeces, according to a BBC investigation. Samples of iced drinks from Costa Coffee, Starbucks and Caffe Nero contained varying levels of the bacteria, the BBC's Watchdog found. Expert Tony Lewis said the levels found were ""concerning"". ""These should not be present at any level - never mind the significant numbers found,"" he added. Cleanliness of tables, trays and high chairs at the chains was also tested at 30 branches. Seven out of 10 samples of Costa ice were found to be contaminated with bacteria found in faeces. At both Starbucks and Caffe Nero, three out of 10 samples tested contained the bacteria known as faecal coliforms. You might also like...

Paddington Bear creator Michael Bond dies,"This video can not be played Paddington Bear was partly based on Michael Bond's father Michael Bond, the creator of beloved children's character Paddington Bear, has died at the age of 91. He died at his home on Tuesday following a short illness, a statement from his publisher Harper Collins said. Bond published his first book, A Bear Called Paddington, in 1958. The character, a marmalade-loving bear from ""deepest, darkest Peru"" who comes to live in London, went on to inspire a series of books, an animated TV series and a successful 2014 film. The beloved character has been seen on both TV and film As well as Paddington, he also created characters including Olga da Polga, A Mouse Called Thursday and a French detective named Monsieur Pamplemousse. A sequel to the Paddington film will be released later this year. ""So sorry to hear that Michael Bond has departed,""Stephen Fry wrote on Twitter,external. ""He was as kindly, dignified, charming and lovable as the immortal Paddington Bear he gave us."" Comedian and author David Walliams alsopaid tribute,external, remembering the author as ""a dazzling wit and perfect gentleman"". Obituary: Michael Bond Paddington: Sharing bears for Michael Bond Hugh Bonneville, who will be seen in Paddington 2 reprising his role as Mr Brown, said it was ""particularly poignant"" to learn of Bond's death on the last day of shooting the sequel. ""In Paddington, Michael created a character whose enthusiasm and optimism has given pleasure to millions across the generations,"" he said. ""Michael will be greatly missed by his legions of fans and especially by his wife Sue, his family and of course by his beloved guinea pigs."" StudioCanal, producer of the Paddington Films, said it was ""deeply saddened,external"" by his passing. ""Very sad to hear Michael Bond has died,"" tweeted broadcasterJeremy Clarkson,external. ""I knew him for 45 years and rarely met anyone kinder or more gentle."" It was Clarkson's mother Shirley who made the first Paddington toy figure as a Christmas present for her son. On his way home from work on Christmas Eve in 1956, Bond spied a lonely teddy bear on the shelf in a shop window, and took it home as a stocking filler for his wife. He called it Paddington because they were living near Paddington Station at the time. While musing over a typewriter and a blank sheet of paper, he wondered idly what it would be like if an unaccompanied bear turned up at a railway station looking for a home. Read the full obituary This video can not be played Michael Bond spoke to the BBC in 2014 about the inspiration for Paddington's famous parcel tag. Born in Newbury in 1926, Bond began his career at the BBC and later worked on Blue Peter as a cameraman. He served with the RAF and the army during World War II and began writing in 1945 while stationed in Cairo. More than 35 million Paddington books have been sold worldwide. The most recent, Paddington's Finest Hour, was published in April. Charlie Redmayne, chief executive officer of HarperCollins, said he was ""one of the great children's writers"" who had left ""one of the great literary legacies of our time"". JD Polson the Armadillo (left) was another of Bond's creations Ann-Janine Murtagh, executive publisher at HarperCollins Children's Books, remembered the author as ""a true gentleman, a bon viveur, the most entertaining company and the most enchanting of writers"". ""He will be forever remembered for his creation of the iconic Paddington, with his duffle coat and wellington boots, which touched my own heart as a child and will live on in the hearts of future generations."" Lauren Child,the new Children's Laureate, said Bond was ""a loveable person"" who had been ""lovely to chat to"". ""I was always delighted if he was at a party,"" she told BBC News. ""He was cheeky, with a twinkle in his eye, and was always such fun."" Speaking to the BBC in 2014, Bond revealed he had created Paddington ""to please myself"" and that he would ""carry on writing the books as long as I can"".

Michael Bond: 'Paddington is eternally optimistic',"Michael Bond's Paddington Bear has become one of the classic characters in children's literature. A chance encounter with a toy bear in a London shop spawned a long line of books, a BBC TV series, a feature film and a lot of merchandise. A prolific writer, he also created The Herbs, featuring Parsley the Lion, which became a successful TV series and the tale-telling guinea pig, Olga da Polga. And for adults there was Monsieur Pamplemousse, the retired detective turned restaurant critic and his bloodhound, Pommes Frites. Thomas Michael Bond was born on 13 January 1926 in Newbury and raised in nearby Reading. One of his earliest childhood memories was standing by the railway line to watch the Cornish Riviera Express thunder past on its way from Paddington to Penzance. Bond's father was the mild-mannered manager of the local post office and was the basis for the character of Paddington Bear, the unassuming ursine stowaway. ""My father was a very polite man and he always wore a hat,"" Bond said. ""We'd go on holiday to the Isle of Wight and he used to go in the sea with his trousers rolled up and keep his hat on in case he met someone he knew and would have something to raise. He would have been mortified if he hadn't."" His parents instilled in him a love of books and he later remembered never going to sleep without a bedtime story. The Herbs first appeared on the BBC in 1968 Bond's happy childhood was interrupted when his parents sent him to a strict Catholic school where the Brothers kept discipline with heavy rubber straps. Bond often suffered this brutal treatment, so much so that he left school at 14 and got a job as a clerk in a local solicitor's office. A year later he was working for the BBC which, impressed with his hobby of building amplifiers and other electrical gadgets, gave him a junior job at a transmitter facility in Reading. His budding career nearly came to a premature end when four German bombs fell on the building where he was working. Despite the ground floor being blown out he escaped unharmed. In 1943 he volunteered for the RAF, later transferring to the army. It was while he was stationed in Egypt that he submitted a short story to the magazine London Opinion, which paid him seven guineas for it. At that point he decided he quite liked the idea of becoming a writer. Bond returned to the BBC in 1947, working at Caversham Park which monitored foreign broadcasts. Three years later he became a BBC cameraman, working on programmes including Blue Peter, while continuing to write short stories. On his way home from work on Christmas Eve in 1956, Bond spied a lonely teddy bear on the shelf in a shop window, and took it home as a stocking filler for his wife. He called it Paddington because they were living near Paddington Station at the time. While musing over a typewriter and a blank sheet of paper, he wondered idly what it would be like if an unaccompanied bear turned up at a railway station looking for a home. The seeds of the idea had taken root during the war when Bond saw newsreels of children being sent out from British cities to avoid German bombing. ""I had memories of children being evacuated from London with a label around their necks and all their possessions in a suitcase, and this became part of Paddington as well,"" he said. ""Paddington Bear was a refugee with a label - 'Please look after this bear. Thank you', and he had a little suitcase."" The BBC's Paddington series proved a success with both children and parents A Bear Called Paddington appeared in 1958 with illustrations by Peggy Fortnum. Ivor Wood would later take over the drawings and he went on to develop the successful BBC TV series that first aired in 1976. Wood came up with the idea of a three-dimensional puppet which moved, using stop motion techniques, against a two-dimensional drawn background. Bond wrote the scripts and the actor, Michael Hordern, narrated the stories. During the 1960s, Bond turned out an average of one Paddington book a year but didn't feel secure enough to become a full-time writer until 1965, when he quit his job with the BBC. Later that decade came the first of the Parsley books, featuring a lion and his friends including Sage the Owl and Sir Basil and Lady Rosemary. These books too were successfully translated onto TV by Wood and his company, FilmFair, first as The Herbs in 1968 and then The Adventures of Parsley which aired in 1970. While aimed at children, it became cult viewing for adults who appreciated the dry humour which probably escaped the target audience. In 1971 Bond published the first of his Olga da Polga stories for children, featuring a guinea pig with a penchant for telling tall stories in the manner of Baron Munchausen. Bond next turned to writing for adults with his Monsieur Pamplemousse books, the first of which appeared in 1983. The idea of a French detective who quit the police and became a restaurant critic came when Bond - a Francophile - was eating in a French restaurant. Pamplemousse and his faithful bloodhound, Pommes Frites, travel the country, sampling menus and getting into a series of comic mystery adventures. The books are full of the wry humour that was Bond's trademark. Bond described the 2014 feature film as 'charming' But the popularity of his original creation never seemed to wane and Bond continued to write adventures for the little bear. As well as the books, a huge merchandising operation was built up and Paddington toys remained high on the wish list of new generations of children. Designer Shirley Clarkson was one of the first licensees to produce the figure with his now famous hat, wellington boots and duffel coat. She made the very first Paddington Bear as a Christmas present for her young son, Jeremy (future presenter of the BBC's Top Gear). In 2014 StudioCanal released a feature film of Paddington, with the bear voiced by Ben Whishaw. Bond, who had a cameo role, called the film ""absolutely delightful"". Since 1958, more than 150 different Paddington titles have been published, and more than 35 million copies have been sold worldwide in more than 40 languages. Bond was still writing in recent months, with Paddington's Finest Hour published in April of this year. It is a volume of letters from the bear to his Aunt Lucy in Peru - the relative who originally despatched him to London more than half a century previously. Michael Bond was once asked why the popularity of Paddington had endured for children in the age of computers and video games. ""Paddington is eternally optimistic and always comes back for more, no matter how many times his hopes are dashed,"" he said. ""It's simply the joy of a little bear who is an outsider getting into scrapes and mishaps - always with the best of intentions - and coming out on top every time.""

'The day I policed a school riot',"Bullying was 'rife' at the school, according to the former teacher (stock image) Inspectors pelted with food, sixth formers intimidated by younger pupils and almost a third of children regularly absent. This was just some of the behaviour uncovered by Ofsted inspectors who rated Willenhall E-ACT Academy ""inadequate"" in every category. Here, one former teacher describes what it was like to work at the West Midlands school. In the days leading up to one of the worst examples of behaviour I saw at Willenhall, tensions had been brewing for a few days because the weather hadn't been great. Pupils had been repeatedly trying to sneak into the building during lunch time and were becoming more brazen. Eventually it became more about winding staff up and exulting in defiance than actually entering the building. They were running from entrance to entrance trying to force their way in, while teams of staff manned doorways, physically barricading them - sometimes while the pupils pushed them. Willenhall school pupils threw food at Ofsted inspectors Strike at school where pupils threw food at inspectors There was a near full-scale riot one day when pupils tried to force their way in. This meant staff spending their lunch break attempting to prevent doors being shoved open - and being physically pushed. Windows were smashed and the fire alarm pulled. A colleague was injured on her shoulder in this event. No support was forthcoming from senior staff despite emailing them and ATL [the 'attitude to learning' team ] throughout the fracas. A number of students were given fixed term exclusions but it had little impact. Pupils were routinely disruptive in lessons (stock image) Attempts to intimidate staff were fairly common. I had pupils attempt to push me, threaten to throw chairs at me and threaten that their fathers would come to the school and assault me. Colleagues of mine were hit by doors, had doors pushed into their injured shoulders and were pushed. Most lessons were also disrupted during my time at the school. A considerable portion of pupils would routinely truant and walk around the school building avoiding their lessons. These pupils would bang on windows, shout, get into fights and disrupt lessons continually. When challenged, they would be threatening and verbally abusive. If they attended lessons, they would generally just sit there and do nothing, or disrupt enough to be removed and then entertain themselves running around the school. I can't quite describe the atmosphere of some classes. There was the steady, constantly increasing hum of pupils talking, as well as pupils throwing things around. Others would wander around while a teacher at the front of the classroom vainly attempted to restore order, an engaging, well-planned lesson sitting unloved on the projector. This situation was ubiquitous in Willenhall. But those more able classes were broadly well behaved, and I genuinely loved every minute of teaching the majority of my classes who were made up of those students who had a passion for learning. A number of pupils would routinely truant, according to the teacher However, the disruptive pupils' behaviour would have a big impact on class time and there were lessons in which nothing was done, literally nothing. Bullying was rife. I had a very sobering day when a fantastic, hard-working, bright, polite, ambitious and witty girl was obviously distraught. I spent lunch talking to her about the horrible bullying she was receiving from a group of older girls, and spoke to their form tutor and head of year in an attempt to address the problem. The girl was shocked - genuinely shocked - that anyone had taken the time. But mainly, the more able pupils were scared, and bored, as they saw their lesson time disappear as teachers wasted their time on fire-fighting poor behaviour rather than helping them improve and reach their goals. It sapped the magical combination of confidence and curiosity which makes young people thrive. They deserve so much better. Like most people in my profession, I wanted to go into teaching because it was a graduate job that allowed me to be passionate about every day, whilst simultaneously make a tangible difference to the lives of others. In areas like Willenhall, a good school can be an engine for social mobility. I had worked in ""tough schools"" throughout my training and I have strong behaviour management, so I was not overly concerned before starting. The school was initially extremely tough and challenging, but manageable - it took me around six months to establish myself there in the face of some shocking abuse. But more common than active defiance and abuse were pupils who turned up, sat there and refused to engage whatsoever in lessons. As these were tacitly tolerated by the senior leadership team, this was difficult to challenge - blame was routinely passed to individual teachers for being insufficiently engaging. Behaviour was awful but it was mainly due to low-level disruption - I felt unsupported but I did not feel unsafe. During this year, in the face of incredible workload demands and the day-to-day battle of managing behaviour, I was diagnosed with depression and an anxiety disorder and went on anti-depressants. A sobering moment in my teaching career was discussing this in the staff room only to have six of the seven teachers present explain that they too were on some form of medication for stress, anxiety, depression or related mental illness. Action was taken to improve things, but the turnover in staff hamstrung this. I made the decision to leave, in part, because I was tired of not being valued as a professional, and knew I could do exactly the same job at any other school in Birmingham. I am now going to be taking up a head of department position at another school from next year. With horrible conditions, patronising management and little career prospects, I was only there due to guilt and a sense of obligation towards my GCSE cohort. I once again find teaching a joy and remember that I hold the best job in the world. We fully recognise that there have been challenges at Willenhall E-ACT Academy, however, with the continued support of the trust across all aspects of the academy, we are confident that Willenhall will continue to make rapid progress so that we can offer the best possible education to our students. The Ofsted report,externalitself recognises that E-ACT has already begun to address the aspects of greatest concern, and we are absolutely committed to turning this academy around. The trust will continue to strengthen leadership at Willenhall and ensure that senior staff have greater visible presence around the academy so that students are absolutely clear on expectations about their  behaviour, and we have already invested in additional staff to support student behaviour outside of classrooms. By working closely with academy staff we will ensure that further improvements in the quality of teaching and learning are secured through focussed reviews of the curriculum and classroom practice. We will also continue to work closely with parents and guardians who are being kept updated on every stage of progress. At E-ACT we are proud of the fact that almost two thirds of our academies are rated at least Good by Ofsted, and we expect Willenhall E-ACT Academy to join this group by the time of their next full Ofsted inspection.

Helicopter attacks Venezuelan court,"This video can not be played The helicopter circles buildings before gunshots and a bang are heard A helicopter has attacked Venezuela's Supreme Court in what President NicolÃ¡s Maduro called a ""terrorist"" incident. Four grenades were dropped on the court and 15 shots fired at the interior ministry on Tuesday, officials said. Rogue policeman Oscar PÃ©rez said he had piloted the stolen helicopter to attack what he called a ""criminal government"". His whereabouts are unknown. Venezuela is in the midst of a political and economic crisis that has sparked mass protests. Who piloted Venezuela's helicopter attack? Inside Venezuela's anti-government protests What is behind Venezuela's turmoil? Many of those opposed to Mr Maduro see the Supreme Court as one of his main supporters. A blue police helicopter was seen flying over central Caracas carrying a banner reading ""350 Freedom"" - a reference to a clause in the constitution cited by opponents of Mr Maduro to claim his government is illegitimate. Images on social media showed two occupants, one masked. The government said 15 shots were fired at a social event at the interior ministry. The helicopter then flew to the court and dropped four Israeli-made grenades of ""Colombian origin"". One failed to detonate. No-one was injured. President Maduro appeared on state television to denounce the attack. He said: ""I have activated the entire armed forces to defend the peace. And you can be assured that sooner or later, we are going to capture that helicopter and those that carried out this terror attack against the institutions of the country."" President Maduro is facing regular protests against his government Information Minister Ernesto Villegas said the military had been deployed to apprehend the pilot and recover the German-built Bolkow helicopter. State TV showed images of the pilot in front of the US Capitol building in Washington. Mr Maduro has long claimed the US government is attempting to have him overthrown. The government has urged calm but called for its supporters to rally outside the presidential palace on Wednesday morning. Freddy Guevara, of the opposition MUD alliance, said there was not yet enough information to comment on the attack. But he posted a tweet on Wednesday calling on people to continue to oppose the Maduro government. He said: ""Maduro knows that nobody supports him, so today more than ever we must continue in the street, generating pressure to overcome this dictatorship!"" Some of the president's opponents took to social media to suggest he was responsible for staging the helicopter attack in order to justify a further crackdown on dissent. The police officer identified himself as Oscar PÃ©rez in video statements posted on the social media platform Instagram. Appearing in military fatigues and flanked by armed, masked men in uniform, he appealed to Venezuelans to oppose ""tyranny"". A police officer identifying himself as Oscar PÃ©rez made a statement on Instagram ""We are a coalition of military employees, policemen and civilians who are looking for balance and are against this criminal government,"" he said. ""We don't belong to any political tendency or party. We are nationalists, patriots and institutionalists."" He said the ""fight"" was not against the security forces but ""against the impunity of this government. It is against tyranny"". It is not clear how much support, if any, the officer has. Mr Maduro said the pilot had previously worked for former Interior and Justice Minister Miguel Rodriguez Torres, who the president has accused of links to the CIA. Mr Rodriguez Torres quickly denied any involvement. The sight of an apparently disaffected member of the security forces dropping grenades on the Supreme Court and allegedly firing on government buildings is extreme, even by Venezuela's standards. Whether ""Oscar PÃ©rez"" is indeed part of a coalition of like-minded ""military employees, policemen and civilians"" or just a rogue policeman is hard to say. Certainly President Maduro was quick to dub the incident ""a terrorist attack"" and used it as a reason to ""activate"" the armed forces to keep the peace. However, earlier in the day he, too, had thrown down the gauntlet to his opponents. ""If the Bolivarian Revolution were to be destroyed,"" he said, ""what couldn't be done with votes, we would do with arms."" The opposition in Venezuela took that as an overt threat. The security situation in Venezuela could hardly be worse ahead of a highly controversial election next month over the government's plans for a new constituent assembly. There have been almost daily anti-government protests in Venezuela for over two months as the country's economic and political crisis worsens. The Supreme Court in Caracas was the target of the attack Those opposed to the government say they are determined to keep protests going until fresh elections are called and the government is ousted. More than 70 people have been killed in protest-related violence since 1 April, according to the chief prosecutor's office. Going hungry in Venezuela President Maduro was quick to suggest it was a coup attempt, but it is unclear how much support the police officer has. Earlier on Tuesday, Mr Maduro reiterated his allegations that the US was supporting coup attempts against his government. On Monday, he announced that five people had been arrested, accused of plotting against him and preparing for a US invasion. Hugo ChÃ¡vez is still a popular figure among supporters of Nicolas Maduro However, Venezuela certainly has a history of coup attempts: In 1992, the late Hugo ChÃ¡vez tried to overthrow the government of President Carlos Andres PÃ©rez. The attempt failed and ChÃ¡vez was arrested and imprisoned. He would eventually be elected president in 1998 In 2002, ChÃ¡vez himself survived an attempted coup by rebel military officers Months later, security officials foiled another attempt by leading political and military opposition figures Who piloted attack helicopter?

"Tesco to axe 1,200 head office jobs","Tesco plans to cut 1,200 jobs at its head office as part of a major cost-cutting drive. The UK's biggest supermarket told staff on Wednesday morning about the cull, which amounts to a quarter of its workforce in Welwyn Garden City and Hatfield. Tesco is implementing a turnaround plan that aims to reduce costs by Â£1.5bn. The cuts come after the retailer said last week it wouldclose a call centre in Cardiffat the cost of 1,200 roles. Tesco said it was a ""significant next step"" in the reorganisation of the company. ""This new service model will simplify the way we organise ourselves, reduce duplication and cost but also, very importantly, allow us to invest in serving shoppers better,"" a spokesperson said. Pauline Foulkes, national officer at shop workers' union Usdaw, said: ""Tesco's head office staff are understandably very concerned that the company is proposing further large-scale job losses. ""Our priorities are to keep as many staff as possible in employment and to get the best possible deal for our members."" Shares in Tesco rose 1.6% to close at 171.7p, but have fallen almost 17% since the start of the year. Tesco chief executive Dave Lewis Tesco said earlier this year that 1,000 roles would go as it reduced the number of distribution centres. It also announced a plan to replace 1,700 deputy managers at its Express convenience stores with 3,000 lower-paid ""shift leaders"". Trading at Tesco has been improving under chief executive Dave Lewis and earlier this month it reported a2.3% rise in UK like-for-like salesfor the three months to 27 May. The supermarket is undertaking a Â£3.7bn takeover of wholesaler and convenience store group Booker, which has drawn opposition from some shareholders. Schroders and Artisan Partners have said that Tesco is paying too much for Booker, which owns the Premier, Budgens and Londis store brands. and has written to chairman John Allan about their concerns. The Competition and Markets Authority has opened thefirst phase of its investigationinto the deal, which will end in late July. 1,100 Tesco call centre jobs set to go Tesco recovery gathers pace in the UK At least two killed and 1,000 structures destroyed as wildfires rage in Los Angeles Watch: Ferocious and explosive fire burns behind CBS reporter Liam Payne cause of death confirmed as UK inquest opens Where is Greenland and why does Trump want it?

Corbyn and May clash on austerity,"This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn tells Theresa May: ""When you cut local authority budgets by 40%, we all pay a price in public safety"" The limit on public sector salary rises could be reviewed, Downing Street has signalled, as a Labour attempt to scrap the 1% cap was defeated in Parliament. Two cabinet ministers have said the five-year cap may be reconsidered while the PM's spokesman suggested the autumn Budget could herald a change of course. Downing Street later sought to dampen down the speculation, insisting current government policy had not changed. And MPs rejected a Labour motion urging immediate change by a majority of 14. The government won the vote on the issue, the first of the new Parliament, by 323 votes to 309. Labour's amendment to the Queen's Speech, which also called for an end to cuts to the police and emergency services, was defeated as the Conservatives and all 10 DUP MPs joined forces to oppose it - for the first time since the two parties announced a parliamentary pact. Live: Prime Minister's Questions reaction More high-rises fail safety checks Unions criticise 1% pay rise for public sector workers May and DUP deal: What you need to know More Britons back tax and spend, survey says Pay rises for five million public sector workers are set by independent pay review bodies, but have effectively been capped at 1% since 2013, before which there was a two-year freeze on pay for all but the lowest-paid workers. The Conservatives went into the election pledging to maintain the cap until 2020, but some MPs are now calling for a rethink after the party lost its majority. This video can not be played Sir Oliver Letwin tells Today a large number of people may pay a little more tax to increase government spending Labour says its motion was a litmus test of MPs' willingness to oppose further austerity measures and the Conservatives had acted as if it was ""business as usual"". ""Although government ministers said they had learned the lessons of the general election and were listening to voters, it is clear that nothing has changed,"" Jeremy Corbyn said. Before the vote, several Conservative MPs called for the cap to be lifted. Speaking during the debate, Conservative MP Andrew Murrison said public sector workers ""give far more back to the service than we give to them in terms of the package"", adding that he was worried the ""well of goodwill"" among medical workers would soon run ""completely dry"". Another Tory MP, former nurse Maria Caulfield, said medical workers ""will vote with their feet"" unless the pay freeze is tackled. Earlier, taking questions at an event in London, Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon said pay rates were ""obviously something we have to consider not just for the army but right across the public sector as a whole"". Laura Kuenssberg, BBC political editor In line with Michael Fallon and Chris Grayling's comments, the government is ready to listen to the case to ""scrap the cap"" - bringing a potential end to the policy that was designed to save Â£5bn for the public purse by 2020. By teatime however, after the Treasury had slightly less enthusiastically said they were ""open to discussion"", that nurse, social worker, teacher or doctor had slightly less cause for feeling optimistic about a bigger pay rise any time soon. Number 10 had perhaps not changed, but certainly tweaked, their tune - saying when asked repeatedly that the policy has not changed, the independent pay review bodies will report in due course and the government will consider their proposals. So far, so confusing. Neither Number 10 nor the Treasury, who it's suggested were not entirely thrilled with the suggestion, are ready by the end of this political day to be able to make such a big change, or to give Labour such a big victory. The problem for them, however, is not just what appears to be a changing mood among some voters, but also very public hints by cabinet members that the cap, becoming painful for some as inflation starts to lift, could disappear along with Theresa May's majority. Read Laura's blog A Number 10 source said public sector pay restraint was ""one of the tough decisions"" the government had had to make but that ministers were going to ""listen to the messages that were sent at the election"" and said, ""we understand that people are weary after years of hard work to re-build the economy"". Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt reiterated this, telling MPs that ministers would wait for the recommendations of the pay review bodies before deciding what action to take. The suggestion of a change of policy was welcomed by campaigners, with TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady saying it would be a ""massive victory for trade union campaigning"". Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, former Conservative minister Sir Oliver Letwin said Labour were  ""playing politics"" but ""carefully judged"" tax increases might be needed to raise money for public services. This video can not be played Theresa May warns councils they should be ""doing the fire safety checks now"" ""It may well be that, in one way or another, a large number of people will have to pay a little more tax if we are going to maintain the trend towards reduced deficits and yet spend a bit more on the crucial public services that do need more spending,"" he added. Meanwhile, the latestBritish Social Attitudes Survey,externalhas found an increase in the number of Britons who think the government should raise taxes and increase spending to its highest level since 2004. Earlier, during PMQs, Mr Corbyn linked the Grenfell Tower disaster to spending cuts. After Mrs May confirmed cladding from 120 high-rise buildings in 37 local authority areas in England had now failed fire safety tests, Mr Corbyn - to an angry reaction from some on the Conservative benches - said this was because cuts to local authority budgets had led to fewer building control and planning inspectors. ""We all pay a price,"" he said, saying there were fewer firefighters in place and that the pay cap had affected recruitment. ""What the Grenfell Tower tragedy has exposed is the disastrous effect of austerity. Labour frontbenchers wore badges highlighting the campaign to end the NHS pay squeeze ""This disregard for working-class communities, the terrible consequences of deregulation and cutting corners - I urge the prime minister to come up with the resources needed to test and remove cladding, retrofit sprinklers, properly fund the fire service and the police so that all our communities can feel safe in their own homes."" Mrs May said the cladding of tower blocks had begun under Tony Blair's Labour government, saying this was an issue that had ""developed over decades"" under successive governments and different councils. Labour has claimed fire and rescue budgets were cut by 30% between 2010 and 2015, and a further 20% cuts are envisaged between 2015 and 2020. But Home Secretary Amber Rudd said the number of fire incidents had halved since 2010 and firefighters' rapid response to the Grenfell tragedy showed the strength of the service.

Nicholas WattPolitical editor, BBC Newsnight Former education secretary Nicky Morgan says Theresa May should consider standing down by autumn 2018 to allow a successor to sell the Brexit deal. Mrs Morgan was sacked by the prime minister last year. Shortly after the election, she said Mrs May should not lead the Tories into the next general election. Mrs Morgan now says the Conservative Party ""must not miss the opportunity"" to think about its next leader once the Brexit deal is finalised. Read more. Responding to the vote on the Queen's Speech, which saw MPs reject Labour's amendment calling for the 1% public sector pay cap to be lifted, Jeremy Corbyn said:
 
""Tonight, the Conservatives had an opportunity to put their money where their mouth is, by ending cuts to our police and fire service and lifting the public sector pay cap. ""Although government ministers said they had learned the lessons of the general election and were listening to voters, it is clear that nothing has changed. ""They had the perfect opportunity to walk the walk, but instead they marched through the lobby to show Tory austerity is business as usual. ""While the money is there when the Conservatives need it to keep themselves in office, the rest of the country now face more devastating cuts to our emergency and other vital services."" Queen's Speech debate House of LordsParliament The crossbencher and architect of Article 50, author Lord Kerr of Kinlochard, earlier criticised the government's whole approach to Brexit negotiations. He said the government were ""alienating"" and ""insulting""
other member states, and: ""That is resented across the Channel. I can't remember when this
country was so isolated and impotent in Brussels as it is now."" If the UK were to put forward a positive plan ""that would change the atmosphere
of the negotiation"", Lord Kerr advised. House of LordsParliament A few lines from the Queen's Speech debate in the Lords a little earlier, where Brexit rather than public sector pay dominates. Former Lib Dem leader Lord Campbell of Pittenweem complained that Theresa May ""missed a golden opportunity by not publishing details"" of arrangements for leaving the EU, particularly relating to EU nationals' rights. He noted that Philip Hammond, who he said has ""recently been released from the bondage imposed on him by Theresa May's former chiefs of staff"", said people did not vote to become poorer but ""many of them are already"". He said he cannot work to further a cause which he believes to be ""profoundly against our interests"". But Conservative peer and former minister Lord Jopling said it is important we don't descend into fighting the referendum over and over again, to approving noises from peers behind him. He argued for letting the ""determined band of Brexiteers"" get on with steering the UK through Brexit. BBC News Channel Now on the BBC News channel, Andrew Gwynne says Conservative MPs ""talk the talk"" about ending the public sector pay cap but didn't back it in a Commons vote. The Labour frontbencher says people supported his party in the general election because they saw ""we can have a different approach"". Conservative MP John Penrose says that Labour ""had a surge at the end of the campaign but it didn't win"". Workers, he adds, are also taxpayers and it is important to get the maximum value for money - although he also says the Tories will listen to voters, and all sides of the House want to spend more on public services. Turning to the narrow result in the Commons a short time ago, Mr Penrose says ""a majority of 14 is workable but it's not huge"" and the government needs to work within the constraints of a hung Parliament.

Michael Bond: 'Paddington Bear was a refugee with a label',"Michael Bond's Paddington Bear has become one of the classic characters in children's literature. A chance encounter with a toy bear in a London shop spawned a long line of books, a BBC TV series, a feature film and a lot of merchandise. A prolific writer, he also created The Herbs, featuring Parsley the Lion, which became a successful TV series and the tale-telling guinea pig, Olga da Polga. And for adults there was Monsieur Pamplemousse, the retired detective turned restaurant critic and his bloodhound, Pommes Frites. Thomas Michael Bond was born on 13 January 1926 in Newbury and raised in nearby Reading. One of his earliest childhood memories was standing by the railway line to watch the Cornish Riviera Express thunder past on its way from Paddington to Penzance. Bond's father was the mild-mannered manager of the local post office and was the basis for the character of Paddington Bear, the unassuming ursine stowaway. ""My father was a very polite man and he always wore a hat,"" Bond said. ""We'd go on holiday to the Isle of Wight and he used to go in the sea with his trousers rolled up and keep his hat on in case he met someone he knew and would have something to raise. He would have been mortified if he hadn't."" His parents instilled in him a love of books and he later remembered never going to sleep without a bedtime story. The Herbs first appeared on the BBC in 1968 Bond's happy childhood was interrupted when his parents sent him to a strict Catholic school where the Brothers kept discipline with heavy rubber straps. Bond often suffered this brutal treatment, so much so that he left school at 14 and got a job as a clerk in a local solicitor's office. A year later he was working for the BBC which, impressed with his hobby of building amplifiers and other electrical gadgets, gave him a junior job at a transmitter facility in Reading. His budding career nearly came to a premature end when four German bombs fell on the building where he was working. Despite the ground floor being blown out he escaped unharmed. In 1943 he volunteered for the RAF, later transferring to the army. It was while he was stationed in Egypt that he submitted a short story to the magazine London Opinion, which paid him seven guineas for it. At that point he decided he quite liked the idea of becoming a writer. Bond returned to the BBC in 1947, working at Caversham Park which monitored foreign broadcasts. Three years later he became a BBC cameraman, working on programmes including Blue Peter, while continuing to write short stories. On his way home from work on Christmas Eve in 1956, Bond spied a lonely teddy bear on the shelf in a shop window, and took it home as a stocking filler for his wife. He called it Paddington because they were living near Paddington Station at the time. While musing over a typewriter and a blank sheet of paper, he wondered idly what it would be like if an unaccompanied bear turned up at a railway station looking for a home. The seeds of the idea had taken root during the war when Bond saw newsreels of children being sent out from British cities to avoid German bombing. ""I had memories of children being evacuated from London with a label around their necks and all their possessions in a suitcase, and this became part of Paddington as well,"" he said. ""Paddington Bear was a refugee with a label - 'Please look after this bear. Thank you', and he had a little suitcase."" The BBC's Paddington series proved a success with both children and parents A Bear Called Paddington appeared in 1958 with illustrations by Peggy Fortnum. Ivor Wood would later take over the drawings and he went on to develop the successful BBC TV series that first aired in 1976. Wood came up with the idea of a three-dimensional puppet which moved, using stop motion techniques, against a two-dimensional drawn background. Bond wrote the scripts and the actor, Michael Hordern, narrated the stories. During the 1960s, Bond turned out an average of one Paddington book a year but didn't feel secure enough to become a full-time writer until 1965, when he quit his job with the BBC. Later that decade came the first of the Parsley books, featuring a lion and his friends including Sage the Owl and Sir Basil and Lady Rosemary. These books too were successfully translated onto TV by Wood and his company, FilmFair, first as The Herbs in 1968 and then The Adventures of Parsley which aired in 1970. While aimed at children, it became cult viewing for adults who appreciated the dry humour which probably escaped the target audience. In 1971 Bond published the first of his Olga da Polga stories for children, featuring a guinea pig with a penchant for telling tall stories in the manner of Baron Munchausen. Bond next turned to writing for adults with his Monsieur Pamplemousse books, the first of which appeared in 1983. The idea of a French detective who quit the police and became a restaurant critic came when Bond - a Francophile - was eating in a French restaurant. Pamplemousse and his faithful bloodhound, Pommes Frites, travel the country, sampling menus and getting into a series of comic mystery adventures. The books are full of the wry humour that was Bond's trademark. Bond described the 2014 feature film as 'charming' But the popularity of his original creation never seemed to wane and Bond continued to write adventures for the little bear. As well as the books, a huge merchandising operation was built up and Paddington toys remained high on the wish list of new generations of children. Designer Shirley Clarkson was one of the first licensees to produce the figure with his now famous hat, wellington boots and duffel coat. She made the very first Paddington Bear as a Christmas present for her young son, Jeremy (future presenter of the BBC's Top Gear). In 2014 StudioCanal released a feature film of Paddington, with the bear voiced by Ben Whishaw. Bond, who had a cameo role, called the film ""absolutely delightful"". Since 1958, more than 150 different Paddington titles have been published, and more than 35 million copies have been sold worldwide in more than 40 languages. Bond was still writing in recent months, with Paddington's Finest Hour published in April of this year. It is a volume of letters from the bear to his Aunt Lucy in Peru - the relative who originally despatched him to London more than half a century previously. Michael Bond was once asked why the popularity of Paddington had endured for children in the age of computers and video games. ""Paddington is eternally optimistic and always comes back for more, no matter how many times his hopes are dashed,"" he said. ""It's simply the joy of a little bear who is an outsider getting into scrapes and mishaps - always with the best of intentions - and coming out on top every time.""

NHS - planning for winter already,"It's June, with some of the hottest weather seen in decades - but the NHS is already worrying about the winter. Sounds odd, but hospital leaders in England argue that if decisions aren't made soon, it will be too late to inject money in a way which will make a difference when the temperature falls and emergency admissions start rising. There is a hint of familiar special pleading in a new report from NHS Providers - which represents hospital, mental health, community and ambulance trusts in England. The organisation has called frequently for more money for the NHS, and there is a tendency for its warnings about underfunding to be dismissed in Whitehall as ""same old, same old"". But the NHS Providers' call for more cash for this winter comes in a year with a tight financial settlement, where funding for NHS England is rising by just over 1% - considerably less than the previous year. Once again, budget increases will lag well behind anticipated demand. The organisation argues that there were ""unacceptable levels of patient risk"" last winter, with ""unsafe"" levels of bed occupancy at times. NHS Providers makes the point that the government's commitment of Â£1 billion extra for social care funding in England this year was partly aimed at easing the pressure on the NHS. The idea was that if elderly patients could be moved more swiftly out of hospital, then beds could be freed up for new admissions. But a survey of its members suggests that only 28% of trusts have had a clear commitment that the money will be used to reduce the delayed transfers of elderly patients from hospitals to social care. Little more than a third report that local authorities are giving a high priority to support the NHS in reducing delayed transfers. The Local Government Association has rejected the trusts' concerns, arguing that the survey was carried out before the detailed plans for the extra social care funding were finalised. It also points out that there are other areas in need of higher investment, such as supporting those with disabilities, and the money was not supposed to be solely focused on relieving winter pressures. But, in essence, hospital representatives are saying that if the new social care money does not help free up many beds, there will have to be other sources of support to help the NHS navigate a difficult winter. On the NHS Providers wish list is an extra Â£350 million from the government for the winter months.  This would be spent on extra staff and increasing beds in community facilities. NHS Providers members claim that they need to know by July at the latest whether any extra money will appear. That gives time for the recruitment of temporary staff and investment in more bed capacity.  Winter funding promised in the autumn will be too late. The Department of Health says Â£100 million more has already been invested in reducing pressure on hospitals in England, and the NHS and local councils will be expected to work together to ensure people are not stuck in hospital unnecessarily. Ministers, preoccupied with the Queen's Speech and Brexit, may feel winter is some way off and not an urgent priority. But if NHS Providers are right, the window for winter planning is getting smaller every week.

Six face charges over Hillsborough,"This video can not be played Crown Prosecution Service statement on Hillsborough Former Ch Supt David Duckenfield faces 95 charges of manslaughter and five other senior figures will be prosecuted over the 1989 Hillsborough disaster. Mr Duckenfield was match commander at the FA Cup semi-final when 96 Liverpool fans were fatally injured in a crush. Ex-South Yorkshire Police (SYP) Ch Insp Sir Norman Bettison, two officers, a solicitor and a Sheffield Wednesday club secretary also face charges. Campaigners said the charges ""send a message about accountability"". Last year, new inquests into the disaster at the Liverpool v Nottingham Forest match, held at Sheffield Wednesday's ground, concluded the fans had been unlawfully killed. The inquests found that Liverpool supporters were not responsible for the dangerous situation at the Leppings Lane turnstiles. For legal reasons, Mr Duckenfield cannot be charged over the death of the 96th victim, Tony Bland, as he died four years after the disaster, prosecutors said. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) must apply to the High Court to lift an order imposed after he was prosecuted privately in 1999, which must be removed before he can be charged. An application will be made to the High Court in a matter of weeks and a senior judge will make a ruling in due course. (Left to right, top to bottom) Sir Norman Bettison, Graham Mackrell, Peter Metcalf, Alan Foster and Donald Denton The full list of individuals and charges are: Mr Duckenfield, 72, faces manslaughter by gross negligence of 95 men, women and children Sir Norman, 61, faces four charges of misconduct in a public office relating to alleged lies he told in the aftermath about the culpability of fans Graham Mackrell, former Sheffield Wednesday club secretary, will be accused of breaching Health and Safety and Safety at Sports Ground legislation Peter Metcalf, who was a solicitor acting for SYP, is charged with perverting the course of Justice, relating to changes to witness statements Former Ch Supt Donald Denton and former Det Ch Insp Alan Foster are accused of perverting the course of justice The six men charged over Hillsborough Hillsborough: Criminal charges explained The defendants, other than Mr Duckenfield, will appear at Warrington Magistrates' Court on 9 August. No organisation will face corporate charges and no-one from the ambulance service will be charged, said Sue Hemming, head of special crime and counter-terrorism at the CPS. She explained that Sheffield Wednesday is now a ""different company"" and, as it is not a successor organisation, is not criminally liable for any offences that might have been committed in 1989. The CPS brought charges following referrals from the Operation Resolve investigation into the causes of the disaster and the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) probe. Assistant Commissioner Rob Beckley, from Operation Resolve, said: ""Our inquiry looked at all aspects of the event, including the planning and the preparation for the game, the safety of the stadium and the response by the emergency services."" Twelve individuals and three organisations were referred to the CPS by the Resolve team. The IPCC investigated the conduct of both SYP and West Midlands Police (WMP) in the days and weeks afterwards.

Ex-police chief faces Hillsborough charges,"This video can not be played Crown Prosecution Service statement on Hillsborough Former Ch Supt David Duckenfield faces 95 charges of manslaughter and five other senior figures will be prosecuted over the 1989 Hillsborough disaster. Mr Duckenfield was match commander at the FA Cup semi-final when 96 Liverpool fans were fatally injured in a crush. Ex-South Yorkshire Police (SYP) Ch Insp Sir Norman Bettison, two officers, a solicitor and a Sheffield Wednesday club secretary also face charges. Campaigners said the charges ""send a message about accountability"". Last year, new inquests into the disaster at the Liverpool v Nottingham Forest match, held at Sheffield Wednesday's ground, concluded the fans had been unlawfully killed. The inquests found that Liverpool supporters were not responsible for the dangerous situation at the Leppings Lane turnstiles. For legal reasons, Mr Duckenfield cannot be charged over the death of the 96th victim, Tony Bland, as he died four years after the disaster, prosecutors said. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) must apply to the High Court to lift an order imposed after he was prosecuted privately in 1999, which must be removed before he can be charged. An application will be made to the High Court in a matter of weeks and a senior judge will make a ruling in due course. (Left to right, top to bottom) Sir Norman Bettison, Graham Mackrell, Peter Metcalf, Alan Foster and Donald Denton The full list of individuals and charges are: Mr Duckenfield, 72, faces manslaughter by gross negligence of 95 men, women and children Sir Norman, 61, faces four charges of misconduct in a public office relating to alleged lies he told in the aftermath about the culpability of fans Graham Mackrell, former Sheffield Wednesday club secretary, will be accused of breaching Health and Safety and Safety at Sports Ground legislation Peter Metcalf, who was a solicitor acting for SYP, is charged with perverting the course of Justice, relating to changes to witness statements Former Ch Supt Donald Denton and former Det Ch Insp Alan Foster are accused of perverting the course of justice The six men charged over Hillsborough Hillsborough: Criminal charges explained The defendants, other than Mr Duckenfield, will appear at Warrington Magistrates' Court on 9 August. No organisation will face corporate charges and no-one from the ambulance service will be charged, said Sue Hemming, head of special crime and counter-terrorism at the CPS. She explained that Sheffield Wednesday is now a ""different company"" and, as it is not a successor organisation, is not criminally liable for any offences that might have been committed in 1989. The CPS brought charges following referrals from the Operation Resolve investigation into the causes of the disaster and the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) probe.

More Britons 'back tax and spend',"The poll asked questions around public spending, national security and people's private lives Nearly half of Britons think the government should raise taxes and increase spending, an annual survey of public opinion suggests. At 48%, it is the highest proportion to support such measures since 2004, according to theBritish Social Attitudes survey,external. The survey also found the public were becoming more sceptical of the EU. And social liberalism was rising on issues such as same-sex relationships, pre-marital sex and abortion. There was a more traditional attitude to national security, however, with more than half wanting strong powers on terror. Roger Harding, head of public attitudes at the National Centre for Social Research, which carries out the survey, said: ""People's tolerance for austerity is drying up, even if that means higher taxes. ""This leftwards tilt on tax and spend is matched by a long-running conservatism on national security and law and order. In all, people want a more active state that's firm but fairer."" Here are the key findings of the survey: 48% say they want higher taxes to pay for more spending on health, education and social benefits; 44% say they want it to stay the same and 4% would like to see taxes cut It is the first time since the financial crash of 2007-8 that more people want more tax and spending than want it to stay the same 21% say that most social security claimants do not deserve help, the lowest ever level on the survey. In 2015, 28% believed this For the first time in more than 30 years, pensions are not the public's top priority for extra welfare spending, the survey says, and has been overtaken by support for more spending on benefits for people who are disabled 61% of people think it is wrong for benefit claimants to use legal loopholes to increase their payments, compared with 48% who think it is wrong to use legal loopholes to pay less tax. The view that it was acceptable to use legal loopholes to pay less tax was most strongly felt among people who were better off The survey found that Britain holds ""traditionally conservative views"" on national security, and the public favoured stronger state powers to tackle terrorism, even before the terror attacks in Manchester and London. More than half of those surveyed - 53% - would support detaining people indefinitely at the time of a suspected terrorist attack without putting them on trial. UK law restricts this to 14 days Seven in 10 people believed that authorities should have the right to stop and search people if a terrorist attack is suspected. Currently, a police officer can only stop and search without ""reasonable grounds"" if a senior police officer has authorised it in advance 80% think the government should have the right to keep people under video surveillance in public areas, while 50% think the government should have the right to monitor emails and information exchanged online There has been a decline in the proportion of people who say that it is acceptable not to obey a law, even if that law is wrong, to 24%. The highest percentage was recorded 25 years earlier in 1991, when 37% believed this Four in 10 back more defence spending 75% say sex before marriage is ""not wrong at all"", up from 42% when the question was first asked in 1983 On same-sex relationships, 64% say they are ""not wrong at all"", up from 57% in 2013 - the year before same-sex marriage became legal in England and Wales 70% say an abortion should be allowed if a woman decides on her own she does not want the child or if a couple cannot afford any more children 77% of people feel a person with a painful incurable disease should be able to legally request that a doctor end their life The research - carried out in the months after last year's EU referendum - suggested that views on immigration had become more polarised, with the young and highly educated more likely to believe that immigration was good for the economy, while older people and non-graduates were more likely to say it was bad. 76% of people said the UK should leave the EU or that if it stays the EU's powers should be reduced, up from 65% in 2015 73% of those who were worried about immigration voted Leave, compared with 36% of those who did not say this was a concern 45% of those who trust the government a great deal or tend to trust it voted Leave, compared with 65% of those who distrust it greatly The survey has been carried out every year since 1983, with questions repeated periodically to assess how opinions change over time. A total of 2,942 people in England, Scotland and Wales were questioned between July and November last year by social research organisation NatCen.

GCSE confusion over university entry,"GCSEs in English and maths are going to be graded from 9 to 1 from this year There are warnings of confusion over university admissions from changes to GCSE exams in England which will create two different pass grades. A number of universities have minimum entry grades at GCSE level - such as a C grade pass at maths and English. But GCSEs are switching to numerical grades, from 9 to 1, and there is uncertainty because both 4 and 5 are officially classed as pass grades. Universities are now setting different ""pass"" grade equivalents. University College London says a C grade pass now requires a grade 5, while Manchester University has set the benchmark at grade 4. How will the new GCSE grading system work? Ofqual advice on the new grading system,external Department for Education explains changes to GCSEs,external Deborah Streatfield, founder of careers advice charity My Big Career, said students and parents were ""confused"" and looking for advice. ""It's inconceivable that a simple task of deciding a pass has led to a ridiculous ""standard pass"" and a ""good pass"". ""Universities and employers need to decide whether a 4 or 5 is the benchmark. ""At the moment different standards across universities will lead to a divisive landscape leading to disadvantaged students losing out again."" Pupils taking their English and maths GCSEs this year will be the first to get the new numerical grades this summer - and these results will have an impact on university applications as well as getting on to A-level courses. For pupils who get a grade 4 in English and maths, it means that they will already be below the threshold for some universities - even though it is a pass grade - and before they even begin their A-level courses. The new numerical system will be phased in for other GCSE subjects over the next few years. Universities can require GCSE passes in English and maths for all courses - but what is the pass grade? When the Education Secretary Justine Greening explained the new points system to the education select committee in March she said that grade 4 would be a ""standard pass"" and grade 5 would be a ""strong pass"". She wrote to the committee chairman to clarify that grade 4 was the ""equivalent to a C and above"" - and that employers and universities would be expected to recognise the grade 4. But there are different interpretations from different universities. University College London says it expectsapplicants for all subjects to have a C grade at maths and English GCSE,external- but under the new system that will be a grade 5. King's College London also makes a grade 5 an equivalent of a grade C for its admissions. But Leeds, Manchester and Liverpool put grade 4 as their requirement. London School of Economics, which previously required grade Bs, now requires a 5, although a B grade could also be the equivalent of a 6. Oxford and Cambridge, which run their own tests and interview systems, do not have such across-the-board minimum requirements for GCSEs. A spokesman for the exam regulator Ofqual said that it remained up to universities to set their admissions rules. But the spokesman said that this year's GCSE candidates would not apply this year - and the requirements might be re-set again after the first wave of results. Suzanne O'Farrell of the ASCL head teachers' union said that some schools might be ""future proofing"" their pupils' results by treating grade 5 as a pass rather than a grade 4. But she said it would not be until next year that it would become apparent how universities would interpret the pass grade. A Department for Education spokesman said that the changes were ""part of our drive to continue raising standards"" and a wide range of resources had been produced to explain the new grading system. ""Most recently every school and college have been sent a pack with information for teachers, students, parents, and employers."" A website had also been launched to answer questions people may have, he said.

High-rise fire safety tests 'pointless',"Grenfell Tower was deemed to only have a medium fire risk The system to assess fire safety of high-rise buildings in the UK is ""pointless"", a leading expert claims. Fire risk assessments (FRAs) carried out by councils do not consider factors such as external cladding, inspections of which areunder way. It is feared cladding helped spread a blaze that killed at least 79 people at Grenfell Tower, which was not deemed a high-risk during inspections in 2016. Prof Arnold Dix said the FRA system was simply a ""box-ticking exercise"". Prof Dix, an independent disaster investigator who looked into theLakanal House fire, in Camberwell, which saw six people killed in 2009, said the fact Grenfell Tower burnt so fast despite being deemed only a medium risk showed FRAs did not work. Grenfell survivor makes first return to tower Grenfell girl's name wins Pullman auction Fire brigade warned councils about cladding Councils across the country are carrying out FRAs following the tower block fire. London Fire Commissioner Dany Cotton has written to all housing providers urging them to carry out FRAs. But Prof Dix said this was ""pointless"" as the same checking system had failed twice - in Lakanal and Grenfell. He said FRAs did not look inside individual properties and did not need to see how the building was originally designed to evacuate people, meaning it was ""like having a full health check and only checking the tonsils"". Prof Dix added the assessments did not take into consideration important factors such as: How many people live in/use the building If household appliances are a high fire-risk because they are very old If extra beds have been brought in that are highly flammable If residents have changed the inside of their flat by removing fire doors or altering walls The ability of people to leave their homes quickly ""Fire assessments are a box ticking exercise. Any real expert needs to view the building in entirety and that is not happening,"" he said. ""They are a one-sided assessment by someone who doesn't know the building."" Who are the victims? Guide to what happened? Six questions for the investigation According to the Fire Protection Association, FRA compliance is only a guarantee of ""evacuation before collapse"" in the event of a fire. But, Prof Dix said people in tower blocks with a high risk should not panic as he did not trust the reliability of the reports. Legally, a sufficient FRA is required on all buildings in England, however, there is no fixed period for a review, although they must be updated if materials used in the building are changed. This video can not be played An expert shows what is wrong with Taplow Tower which has now been evacuated over safety concerns Each assessment is also subjective to the experience of the person carrying out the check. FRAs are carried out on all types of buildings such as hospitals and schools, not just tower blocks. Howard Passey, principal consultant at the Fire Protection Association, said it was best practice for FRAs to be carried out every year. Fire escape routes - a staircase should be able to protect against a fire for 60 minutes Emergency lighting, signage Fire doors Alarms Electric cabling/gas pipes Source: Fire Protection Association But, BBC London research shows this has not been happening across council-maintained tower blocks in the city. It shows there are 16 council-run tower blocks with a high-risk rating, which means the building would not be considered able to contain the spread of a fire. Figures obtained by 30 out of 33 councils also show 419 tower blocks received the medium-risk rating. Of the 21 tower blocks managed by Kensington and Chelsea Council, which includes Grenfell Tower, all were rated as having a medium FRA rating. Experts have expressed concerns that lessons were not learned since the Lakanal House fire in 2009 Tower Hamlets has eight tower blocks which have been assessed to have a substantial fire risk. In a statement it said residents had been contacted to say FRAs had been carried out in all its blocks in the past nine months. Since the Grenfell Tower blaze further assessments were carried out. ""Works are scheduled to take place in the next 10 days which were agreed with the London Fire Brigade after joint inspections took place,"" it said. ""We are working to ensure that the works are completed as soon as possible.""

Mayor John Biggs said however, the recommendations for changes it had received ""were not unmanageable"". Hammersmith and Fulham, Westminster, Lambeth and Newham councils were all unable to provide their latest FRAs. Where have cladding fire tests failed?

Ex-police chief faces Hillsborough charge,"This video can not be played Crown Prosecution Service statement on Hillsborough Former Ch Supt David Duckenfield faces 95 charges of manslaughter and five other senior figures will be prosecuted over the 1989 Hillsborough disaster. Mr Duckenfield was match commander at the FA Cup semi-final when 96 Liverpool fans were fatally injured in a crush. Ex-South Yorkshire Police (SYP) Ch Insp Sir Norman Bettison, two officers, a solicitor and a Sheffield Wednesday club secretary also face charges. Campaigners said the charges ""send a message about accountability"". Last year, new inquests into the disaster at the Liverpool v Nottingham Forest match, held at Sheffield Wednesday's ground, concluded the fans had been unlawfully killed. The inquests found that Liverpool supporters were not responsible for the dangerous situation at the Leppings Lane turnstiles. For legal reasons, Mr Duckenfield cannot be charged over the death of the 96th victim, Tony Bland, as he died four years after the disaster, prosecutors said. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) must apply to the High Court to lift an order imposed after he was prosecuted privately in 1999, which must be removed before he can be charged. An application will be made to the High Court in a matter of weeks and a senior judge will make a ruling in due course. (Left to right, top to bottom) Sir Norman Bettison, Graham Mackrell, Peter Metcalf, Alan Foster and Donald Denton The full list of individuals and charges are: Mr Duckenfield, 72, faces manslaughter by gross negligence of 95 men, women and children Sir Norman, 61, faces four charges of misconduct in a public office relating to alleged lies he told in the aftermath about the culpability of fans Graham Mackrell, former Sheffield Wednesday club secretary, will be accused of breaching Health and Safety and Safety at Sports Ground legislation Peter Metcalf, who was a solicitor acting for SYP, is charged with perverting the course of Justice, relating to changes to witness statements Former Ch Supt Donald Denton and former Det Ch Insp Alan Foster are accused of perverting the course of justice The six men charged over Hillsborough Hillsborough: Criminal charges explained The defendants, other than Mr Duckenfield, will appear at Warrington Magistrates' Court on 9 August. No organisation will face corporate charges and no-one from the ambulance service will be charged, said Sue Hemming, head of special crime and counter-terrorism at the CPS. She explained that Sheffield Wednesday is now a ""different company"" and, as it is not a successor organisation, is not criminally liable for any offences that might have been committed in 1989. The CPS brought charges following referrals from the Operation Resolve investigation into the causes of the disaster and the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) probe. Assistant Commissioner Rob Beckley, from Operation Resolve, said: ""Our inquiry looked at all aspects of the event, including the planning and the preparation for the game, the safety of the stadium and the response by the emergency services."" Twelve individuals and three organisations were referred to the CPS by the Resolve team. The IPCC investigated the conduct of both SYP and West Midlands Police (WMP) in the days and weeks afterwards. Any decision regarding WMP, which was brought in to carry out the original investigation into the conduct of SYP officers, will be made at a later date. This video can not be played Trevor Hicks and Margaret Aspinall spoke to reporters after the announcement Ms Hemming made the announcement of the intended prosecutions to victims' families at a private meeting in Warrington earlier. She said: ""Following our careful review of the evidence, in accordance with the code for Crown prosecutors, I have decided that there is sufficient evidence to charge six individuals with criminal offences. ""Criminal proceedings have now commenced and the defendants have a right to a fair trial."" Campaigner Trevor Hicks, whose daughters Victoria, 15, and Sarah, 19, died in the disaster, said: ""There will be six people facing criminal charges who might not have done if we hadn't been resilient and all stuck together and fought this long fight. ""There are no winners in this, it doesn't bring anybody back. ""What it does do is send a message about accountability, as we keep saying, that nobody but nobody is above the law; be it the police or anybody else."" Chairwoman of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, Margaret Aspinall, whose son James, 18, was killed, said: ""This is definitely the start of the end. ""I think everybody needs that, I think we all need peace from Hillsborough but we can never have peace until we've got truth, justice, accountability. ""I think that's the time we'll all have peace."" Barry Devonside leaving Parr Hall in Warrington after the charges were announced Barry Devonside, whose son Christopher, 18, was killed in the disaster, said: ""Everybody applauded when it was announced that the most senior police officer on that particular day will have charges presented to him."" Evelyn McDonnell Mills, whose brother Peter McDonnell, 21, died, said she was ""really happy"", but sad that her brother who campaigned for years and died during the new inquests never got to see their conclusion. Relatives hugged and wiped away tears after the CPS announced its decision to charge six individuals Pete Weatherby QC, who represents 22 of the victims' families, said they had ""always known that accountability is the most difficult objective"". ""They remain keen to see the criminal process properly pursued for those who have been charged... [and] hope that the memories of their loved ones and the integrity of the fans who attended Hillsborough will be respected during the process."" Lawyer Marcia Willis-Stewart, speaking on behalf other families, said: ""The families are sensitive to the issues of fairness and due process and no-one wishes to prejudice or to jeopardise it. ""There are of course various legal options open to the families where decisions have been made not to prosecute, in the form of the victim and judicial review process."" Inquests into the disaster at Sheffield Wednesday's stadium concluded the fans had been unlawfully killed BBC News profiles of all those who died At Prime Minister's Questions, Theresa May said: ""I know from working closely with the families when I was home secretary that this will be a day of mixed emotions for them."" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn offered a ""tribute to all of those that spent a great deal of time trying to ensure there was justice for those that died at Hillsborough"". Sir Norman has said he is ""disappointed to be charged"" and will ""vigorously defend"" his innocence. Mr Duckenfield and Mr Denton's legal representative Ian Lewis, from JMW Solicitors said ""it would be inappropriate for me as their solicitor, or for my clients themselves, to make any comment"". Mr Metcalf declined to comment. Dr Alan Billings, the South Yorkshire police and crime commissioner, said he hoped the start of criminal proceedings would ""lead to a measure of closure for the family members who have experienced a long and traumatic process"".

'May's top team splits over Brexit',"The Times leads with claims which appear in several papers that Theresa May's ""top team"" are split over Brexit. It says the prime minister appears to be struggling to contain differences,externalbetween Brexit Secretary David Davis and Chancellor Philip Hammond. And, it says, Mr Hammond mocked Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson in a speech in Berlin. The Daily Mail talks of top Tories turning on each other,externalin a Brexit row, with Mr Davis accusing Mr Hammond of a lack of consistency and Mr Hammond taking a swing at Mr Johnson. ""Cabinet chaos on Brexit,""is the headline in the i newspaper,external. Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning The Daily Telegraph gives space on its front page to a warning,externalfrom Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon that the UK could respond to future cyber attacks with air strikes. He said such attacks ""could invite a response from any domain - air, land, sea or cyberspace"". TheSun,externalapplauds Sir Michael and says the cyber threat is real. But it has a question: ""Will we be deploying our new Â£3bn aircraft carrier which uses the old, unsupported and eminently hackable Windows XP system?"" That is a reference to HMS Queen Elizabeth, which sailed from the Firth of Forth this week for sea trials. Max Hastings,in the Daily Mail,external, says he is not impressed with the new pride and joy of the Royal Navy, calling it ""a blunder"" which ""reflects delusions of grandeur"". He believes it got the go-ahead only because Gordon Brown became prime minister in 2007 and was ""passionate about Scottish shipyards"" and ""creating jobs in marginal constituencies"". The Times worries about the UK's,externallow troop numbers. Aircraft carriers, it says, project prestige abroad - but Britain looks in danger of valuing prestige over security. However,according to Con Coughlin in the Daily Telegraph,external, the new carrier demonstrates that, far from being a nation in retreat, the UK still takes its global responsibilities seriously. The Times devotes a double page spread,externalto coverage of the record Â£2.1bn fine imposed on Google by the European Commission. It says US tech companies have long complained that the EU unfairly focuses on them about competition issues and tax - and Silicon Valley could lobby President Donald Trump to retaliate. The Daily Mirror says the clampdown,externalis about more than just Google. It is about the dominance of US goliaths, including Apple and Amazon, a battle by Brussels to rein them in and how Washington and Mr Trump will respond. According to the Daily Express,external, government figures reveal that millions of Britons could be sleepwalking towards a poverty-stricken retirement. A study by the Office for National Statistics found that two in three of the UK's adults have given no thought to the number of years they need to fund when they stop working. The paper talks of Britain's ""growing pensions timebomb"". Finally, theDaily Mirror highlights a prediction from a construction giant,externalthat brickies could be a thing of the past by 2050.

Flights affected by airport power cut,"This video can not be played Passengers were queuing outside the terminal after the power cut delayed flights Flights and terminal services at Edinburgh Airport have been disrupted by a power cut. It is understood the electricity failed just before 09:00. The airport said power had been restored and operations were returning to normal, but warned passengers there could be further delays. Long queues which had formed outside the building have now gone, but the main terminal building is still very busy. The power cut affected the terminal and the main hall was plunged into darkness with only emergency lighting available for almost an hour. It was not possible to provide the usual ground services such as check-in or security during the outage. Airport authorities were dealing with a backlog of passengers who were unable to check-in for about 90 minutes. The airport said that back-up power systems also failed inside the terminal, but not on the airfields, which is why runway lights remained on. It is not known what caused the power failure. Some passengers who landed during the power cut were unable to leave planes because immigration facilities were down, and had to be let off gradually. An airport spokesman said: ""We can confirm that power is now returning to the terminal and that flights have resumed. ""We're working to allow passengers to continue their journeys in a safe and ordered manner and we thank passengers for their patience whilst we do this. ""As always, the safety of passengers and staff is our priority. We expect there to be further delays whilst we clear the backlog."" Hundreds of passengers inside the terminal were advised to be patient while engineers worked to restore power. Those planning to fly later are being advised to come to the terminal building as usual. Miranda Hurst, from Edinburgh, who is due to fly to London, told the BBC Scotland news website, said: ""I was on the airport bus when we were told the bus couldn't go any further as there had been a power cut so the barrier could not be lifted. ""So we had to walk. When I arrived at the terminal the lights were off and nobody knew what was happening. ""I'm in a queue at the arrivals exit as we cant go upstairs as there is no security as they can't scan anything. ""The Tannoy has been affected too so they can't communicate anything to us. They have started handing out water to us."" There are big queues at Edinburgh Airport due to the power cut Sandy Sneddon, from the Church of Scotland, said he had come to the airport to pick up a group from Korea. ""The power's back on but I'm still waiting for 23 delegates from the National Council of Churches in Korea. ""They were due arrive at 09:25, but there's still nothing on the screens and no updates as to where they are. He added: ""Everyone is calm, only just a bit annoyed.""

'Boaty McBoatface' returns home,"Boaty undertook three dives with the longest conducted over three days Boaty McBoatface, the UK's favourite yellow submarine, has returned from its first major science expedition. The vehicle was used in the Antarctic to map the movement of deep, cold water as it moves away from the White Continent towards the Atlantic Ocean. Scientists say this flow of water plays an important role in helping to regulate the Earth's climate system. Boaty made a total of three dives, reaching down to 4,000m below the surface. And by all accounts, it acquired a remarkable set of new data. ""We were extremely pleased with Boaty's performance,"" said Prof Alberto Naveira-Garabato from the University of Southampton, the lead scientist for the investigations conducted from the deck of theRoyal Research Ship James Clark Ross,external. ""Boaty's longest dive was over three days, covering 180km. Boaty flew through some very strong currents, very close to the ocean bottom and encountered some really steep terrain. And it did this while running through a very complex sampling pattern."" Robot snake slithers to ocean missions Arctic crossing planned for âBoatyâ sub Ceremony marks polar ship construction Boaty carries the name that a public poll had suggested be given to the UK's futureÂ£200m polar research vessel. The government felt this would be inappropriate and directed the humorous moniker go on a submersible instead (the ship will be called the RSS Sir David Attenborough). Southampton'sNational Oceanography Centre (NOC),external- the home of Boaty - is actually going to use the brand on three robots in its newAutosub Long Range class,external. These subs have proven their capabilities in various sea trials but the Antarctic venture was the first full science expedition, proper. Bottom-water is generated at the margin of the continent and then spills north into the Atlantic Boaty was programmed to swim through a narrow gap in the ocean-floor ridge that extends northeast of the Antarctic Peninsula. Known as the Orkney Passage, this opening is a critical ""valve"" in the so-called ""great ocean conveyor"" - the relentless system of deep circulation that helps redistribute all the heat energy that has built up in the climate system. There is evidence that this flow of bottom-water is warming, perhaps because of a strengthening of the winds over the Southern Ocean. Prof Naveira-Garabato told BBC News: ""When the winds change speed they can lead to an acceleration or deceleration of the currents carrying the bottom-water out of Antarctica. And when these currents change speed they will produce more or less turbulence depending on whether they go faster or slower, and that can change how much heat gets mixed into the currents from above, because the waters above are warmer."" That could have a number of important implications, not least for sea-level rise, because if the bottom-water is warming it will expand and push up the ocean surface. This video can not be played Scientist Eleanor Frajka-Williams describes a Boaty dive through Orkney Passage Boaty took temperature, salinity (saltiness), current, and turbulence measurements on its deep dives. ""On the cruise, we also took lots of measurements from the ship using profiling instruments, giving us very high-resolution in depth, but at a fixed point in time and space,â explained Dr Povl Abrahamsen from the British Antarctic Survey. âAnd we recovered instruments that had been moored in the area over the last two years, giving us good coverage in time, but again at a fixed point and depth. The data from Boaty fills in the gaps between these measurements, yielding data that we canât get in any other way."" The sub's exploits were not all trouble free, however. At the start of one dive, Boaty encountered a swarm of krill so dense that its echo sounders thought it was approaching the seabed even though it was only at 80m depth. The sub returned to the surface as a consequence. ""Boaty is cutting-edge technology, and is still under development. As is always the case when pushing the boundaries, a few minor mishaps did occur,"" said Dr Abrahamsen. ""But we learn from these problems, rectify them, and it makes Boaty more reliable in the future, enabling it to undertake more complex missions, farther away from ship support.""

Helicopter 'attacks' Venezuelan court,"This video can not be played The helicopter circles buildings before gunshots and a bang are heard A helicopter has attacked Venezuela's Supreme Court in what President NicolÃ¡s Maduro called a ""terrorist"" incident. Four grenades were dropped on the court and 15 shots fired at the interior ministry on Tuesday, officials said. Rogue policeman Oscar PÃ©rez said he had piloted the stolen helicopter to attack what he called a ""criminal government"". His whereabouts are unknown. Venezuela is in the midst of a political and economic crisis that has sparked mass protests. Who piloted Venezuela's helicopter attack? Inside Venezuela's anti-government protests What is behind Venezuela's turmoil? Many of those opposed to Mr Maduro see the Supreme Court as one of his main supporters. A blue police helicopter was seen flying over central Caracas carrying a banner reading ""350 Freedom"" - a reference to a clause in the constitution cited by opponents of Mr Maduro to claim his government is illegitimate. Images on social media showed two occupants, one masked. The government said 15 shots were fired at a social event at the interior ministry. The helicopter then flew to the court and dropped four Israeli-made grenades of ""Colombian origin"". One failed to detonate. No-one was injured. President Maduro appeared on state television to denounce the attack. He said: ""I have activated the entire armed forces to defend the peace. And you can be assured that sooner or later, we are going to capture that helicopter and those that carried out this terror attack against the institutions of the country."" President Maduro is facing regular protests against his government Information Minister Ernesto Villegas said the military had been deployed to apprehend the pilot and recover the German-built Bolkow helicopter. State TV showed images of the pilot in front of the US Capitol building in Washington. Mr Maduro has long claimed the US government is attempting to have him overthrown. The government has urged calm but called for its supporters to rally outside the presidential palace on Wednesday morning. Freddy Guevara, of the opposition MUD alliance, said there was not yet enough information to comment on the attack. But he posted a tweet on Wednesday calling on people to continue to oppose the Maduro government. He said: ""Maduro knows that nobody supports him, so today more than ever we must continue in the street, generating pressure to overcome this dictatorship!"" Some of the president's opponents took to social media to suggest he was responsible for staging the helicopter attack in order to justify a further crackdown on dissent. The police officer identified himself as Oscar PÃ©rez in video statements posted on the social media platform Instagram. Appearing in military fatigues and flanked by armed, masked men in uniform, he appealed to Venezuelans to oppose ""tyranny"". A police officer identifying himself as Oscar PÃ©rez made a statement on Instagram ""We are a coalition of military employees, policemen and civilians who are looking for balance and are against this criminal government,"" he said. ""We don't belong to any political tendency or party. We are nationalists, patriots and institutionalists."" He said the ""fight"" was not against the security forces but ""against the impunity of this government. It is against tyranny"". It is not clear how much support, if any, the officer has. Mr Maduro said the pilot had previously worked for former Interior and Justice Minister Miguel Rodriguez Torres, who the president has accused of links to the CIA. Mr Rodriguez Torres quickly denied any involvement. The sight of an apparently disaffected member of the security forces dropping grenades on the Supreme Court and allegedly firing on government buildings is extreme, even by Venezuela's standards. Whether ""Oscar PÃ©rez"" is indeed part of a coalition of like-minded ""military employees, policemen and civilians"" or just a rogue policeman is hard to say. Certainly President Maduro was quick to dub the incident ""a terrorist attack"" and used it as a reason to ""activate"" the armed forces to keep the peace. However, earlier in the day he, too, had thrown down the gauntlet to his opponents. ""If the Bolivarian Revolution were to be destroyed,"" he said, ""what couldn't be done with votes, we would do with arms."" The opposition in Venezuela took that as an overt threat. The security situation in Venezuela could hardly be worse ahead of a highly controversial election next month over the government's plans for a new constituent assembly. There have been almost daily anti-government protests in Venezuela for over two months as the country's economic and political crisis worsens. The Supreme Court in Caracas was the target of the attack Those opposed to the government say they are determined to keep protests going until fresh elections are called and the government is ousted. More than 70 people have been killed in protest-related violence since 1 April, according to the chief prosecutor's office. Going hungry in Venezuela President Maduro was quick to suggest it was a coup attempt, but it is unclear how much support the police officer has. Earlier on Tuesday, Mr Maduro reiterated his allegations that the US was supporting coup attempts against his government. On Monday, he announced that five people had been arrested, accused of plotting against him and preparing for a US invasion. Hugo ChÃ¡vez is still a popular figure among supporters of Nicolas Maduro However, Venezuela certainly has a history of coup attempts: In 1992, the late Hugo ChÃ¡vez tried to overthrow the government of President Carlos Andres PÃ©rez. The attempt failed and ChÃ¡vez was arrested and imprisoned. He would eventually be elected president in 1998 In 2002, ChÃ¡vez himself survived an attempted coup by rebel military officers Months later, security officials foiled another attempt by leading political and military opposition figures Who piloted attack helicopter?

Violence 'on rise' in riot-hit jail,"Riot vans and police officers gathered outside the prison during the 12-hour riot in December Violence is on the rise at a riot-hit jail because of a high volume of illegal drugs inside, inspectors say. Safety at HMP Birmingham is at risk as a result, they said, after the12-hour disturbanceinvolving hundreds of inmates last December. The riot had a ""profound"" effect on staff who were in shock but committed to moving on, inspectors said. G4S, which runs the jail, said the findings were a ""fair assessment"" of challenges it faced. February's inspection was carried out to check on how prisoners were being housed after 500 were moved after the riot and not to look at why it happened, chief inspector of prisons Peter Clarke said. The findings come as wings of the jail that were damaged in the riot have fully re-opened to inmates. The inspection followed an assessment by the Independent Monitoring Board last October that saidan ""urgent"" solution was neededto stop prisoners taking psychoactive drugs. But, inspectors said illegal drugs were still widely available in February, with 52% of inmates saying said it was easy to get them - including psychoactive substances like Spice. This was up from 37% at the last inspection, in 2014, which saidconditions had improvedat the Category B jail. Broken windows and cramped cells were highlighted by inspectors One in seven inmates also said they had developed a drug problem at the prison and nurses treated prisoners under the influence of those substances on 52 occasions in January. The use of mobile phones and drones to arrange and deliver drugs was ""a significant threat"". Violence had increased ""substantially"", much of it linked to the drug use, and some prisoners felt unsafe, inspectors said. @snappersk photographed members of the specialist Tornado unit leaving the prison covered in paint after the riot The disturbance took much of the newer accommodation out of use, leaving more than 900 prisoners in older Victorian accommodation. Despite improvements to some internal communal areas, many of the showers, stairways and sluices were dirty, along with cramped cells, many having broken windows. Conditions in cells were also reported by inspectors However, security processes in the aftermath of the riot were ""broadly proportionate"". Inspectors praised many positive interactions between staff and prisoners and said healthcare was generally good and community rehabilitation projects were working better than in other jails. Prison director, Richard Stedman, said: ""We are resolute in our determination to move on, make progress and not be defined by December's disorder and this week the prison returns to its full operational capacity."" Michael Spurr, HM Prison and Probation Service chief executive, said ""There remains more to do to provide purposeful activity and to tackle violence and illicit drug use, but the staff and the leadership team deserve credit for the commendable way they have responded to the challenges to date. Frances Crook, chief executive of the Howard League for Penal Reform, said the prison was in the headlines for ""all the wrong reasons last year"" and remains a hotbed of violence. Since the last inspection three inmates had taken their own lives. Serious incidents of self-harm were investigated and lessons learned There were 419 incidents of self-harm in the six months prior to the inspection, more than three times the number recorded last time Black and minority ethnic prisoners, who make up 36% of the population, said they felt safer and reported better relationships with staff than white prisoners In a six-month period to November 2016, 130 serious incidents occurred A clear strategy and plan to reduce the level of violence should be introduced The effectiveness of action to reduce violence should also be monitored All prisoners should have access to learning and skills and work activities Source: HM Inspectorate of Prisons The four damaged wings reopen this week, six months after the riot Hundreds of prisoners moved after riot Footage shows riot destruction.

"A&E cuts will hit 23m people, doctors say","Nearly 23 million people in England - more than 40% of the population - could be affected by proposed cuts to A&E departments, doctors are warning. The analysis of NHS plans by the British Medical Association also warned the changes were being rushed through without the evidence they will work. The proposals have been put forward by local managers seeking to make savings under the direction of NHS England. Bosses have argued services in the community will be boosted in return. Under the so-called ""sustainability and transformation programme"" (STP), England has been divided into 44 areas and each asked to come up with its own proposals. After analysing local plans, the BMA found: 18 of them, covering a population of 22.9 million, involved the closing or downgrading of an A&E department 14 of them, responsible for 17.6 million patients, propose closing or merging a hospital 13 of them, covering a population of 14.7 million, have put forward closing hospital beds As the STP areas cover quite wider geographies with several hospitals, a cut may not mean everyone sees their nearest hospital affected. It could, for example, have an impact on the hospital in the next county or town. But the BMA argues everyone will be affected as a closure in one part of the area means a knock-on for other sites in the patch. A separate exercise, involving freedom of information requests which half of STPs answered, found more than 150 new jobs had been created to run them, at a cost of Â£8.5m a year. Another Â£1m was being spent on agency staff and consultants, the BMA said. BMA leader Dr Mark Porter said the money was being ""wasted"" and the changes ""rushed through without appropriate evidence"". But NHS England rejected the criticism. It argues changes will only take place when there is a viable plan to improve care elsewhere whether through centralising care at a nearby hospital or extending community services, such as with longer GP opening. The STP process was launched at the start of 2016 with a view to identifying some of the Â£22bn of savings that are needed by 2020. NHS England has said by doing more in the community or centralising specialist hospital care, such as stroke services, you can make services more efficient. Public consultations on the most major changes are expected to get under way later this year. A spokesman for NHS England said: ""Rather than just commenting from the sidelines, local health and care leaders and clinicians are coming together to actually try and solve some deep-seated problems by identifying practical ways to improve services.""

Hen harrier plunging to extinction in England,"Female hen harriers have brown plumage - possibly for camouflage in the heather The hen harrier, an iconic bird of prey, is heading towards the brink of extinction in England, new figures suggest. There are just four breeding pairs left in England and numbers are declining elsewhere in the UK. Scotland is the traditional stronghold of these raptors, but numbers have fallen 9% since 2010. Numbers of hen harrier pairs in Wales fell by more than a third over the same period. The birds of prey live primarily on heather moorland. The males are easily identified by their black wing tips. The females look completely different, with puffy brown plumage that helps camouflage them and their nests. But this iconic species is under severe threat, according to the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB). Males of the species are strikingly different in appearance Illegal killings, along with destruction of their habitat, are behind the collapse of their population in England. Numbers fell from twelve pairs in 2010 to just four in 2016. Numbers of pairs in Scotland fell from 505 to 460 over the period, while in Wales they declined from 57 to 35 breeding pairs. In Northern Ireland, pairs fell from 59 recorded in 2010 to 46 in 2016. Hen harriers feed on grouse, which has brought conservationists into conflict with managers of estates involved in grouse shooting. Martin Harper, conservation director at the RSPB, said: ""The latest figures back up a continued trend that we have seen for more than a decade - hen harrier numbers are on the decline throughout the UK. ""The illegal killing of this bird of prey is a significant factor behind the diminishing numbers and a large barrier stopping their recovery."" A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said: ""We take the protection of wildlife extremely seriously and have robust measures in place to protect all wild birds, including the hen harrier. ""Anyone who kills or injures a wild bird is committing an offence and could face jail if convicted."" Historically, hen harriers were once much more widespread before being driven to extinction in mainland Britain during the 19th Century. Despite a subsequent comeback, the species has remained rare - and therefore vulnerable - in the UK, with a breeding population under 1,000 pairs. Longer term figures highlight the dramatic decline in the UK hen harrier population over the past 12 years. The national survey in 2004 pointed to an estimated 749 pairs, meaning hen harrier numbers have fallen by 204 pairs (39%) in the succeeding years. Mr Harper added: ""Without purposeful action from all, including governments across the UK and the shooting industry, we may see hen harriers once again lost from more parts of the country.""
