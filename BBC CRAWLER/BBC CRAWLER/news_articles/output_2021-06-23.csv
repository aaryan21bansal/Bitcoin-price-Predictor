Biden backs funding more police to fight crime wave,"This video can not be played Watch Biden talk about the ""blood of patriots"" President Joe Biden has unveiled a plan that includes funding more police to combat a nationwide surge in homicides, which he blamed on lax gun control. He said officials in high crime areas can hire more law-enforcement personnel using coronavirus relief funding. Mr Biden's crime-fighting strategy calls for curtailing rogue gun dealers and firearms trafficking. Republicans are depicting Mr Biden's Democrats as weak on crime, amid calls by left-wingers to defund the police. Announcing his five-point strategy at the White House on Wednesday, the president urged cities and states to use $350bn (Â£250bn) of funding from a Covid-19 relief bill on public safety efforts, including adding more police officers, even beyond pre-pandemic levels. ""It means more police officers, more nurses, more counsellors, more social workers or community violence interrupters to help resolve issues before they escalate into crimes,"" the president said. Some members of Mr Biden's party have amplified calls by Black Lives Matter activists to defund the police, though the president himself has resisted the slogan, which is unpopular with most voters. Mr Biden - who as a senator wrote a 1994 crime bill widely blamed for mass incarceration of black people - said on Wednesday: ""This is not a time to turn our backs on law enforcement or our communities."" Unless tamed, the crime wave is likely to become a major issue ahead of next year's congressional mid-term elections. America's gun culture in charts Is the US seeing a surge in violent crime? Former officers explain killings by police During his remarks at the White House, the president also took aim at armed insurrectionists, saying they would ""need F-15s and maybe some nuclear weapons"" to take on the US government. The Biden administration has proposed gun control as a remedy for violent crime, although Democratic bills in Congress to limit Americans' access to firearms have been blocked by Republicans. The administration's strategy also proposes investing in community violence intervention programmes, employment opportunities and summer activities for teenagers and young adults, and support for formerly incarcerated Americans re-entering their communities. The president recently hosted several big city mayors at the White House for a discussion on crime prevention. In March, the FBI released preliminary 2020 statistics showing a significant jump - 25% - in murders from the year before. So far, the upward trend has continued into 2021. The bureau will release its official numbers in September. If early projections bear out, it will be one of the largest homicide increases ever reported. ""This was a large scale national increase in violence,"" Jeff Asher, co-founder of AH Datalytics and a former analyst for the CIA and Department of Defense, told the BBC. Some analysts have blamed the wave of homicides on the Covid-19 pandemic, althoughresearch indicates,externalthat global crime rates outside the US fell or were stable amid all the lockdowns. Other analysts see the cause as low police morale after the murder of George Floyd last year in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and the ensuing civil unrest that swept US cities. A University of Utah study pinpointed,externalthe spike in US homicides to late May 2020, when Mr Floyd was killed by an officer. But even with this steep rise, the murder rate is still far lower than in the early 1990s, when it was almost double the current figure. And crime overall - including rapes, robbery and other property crime - dropped by about 6% in 2020, among the largest decreases on record. There are a few political issues that, when they reach a boiling point, crowd out just about every other subject in national discussion. The economy is one. Crime is another. And while things seem to be looking fairly good for Joe Biden on the former, an uptick in violent crime could be a serious challenge for Democrats ahead of next year's mid-term elections. Criminal statisticians will point out that the current murder rates are still low compared to previous decades, including the 1990s, when Biden - then a senator - made ""getting tough on crime"" one of his top issues. The general public, however, typically doesn't have such long-term perspective. Republicans have offered an explanation - that the anti-law-enforcement rhetoric and ""defund the police"" efforts from last year's Black Lives Matters demonstrations have led to the current situation. On Wednesday, Biden offered a counter-argument, that lax gun regulations are to blame, creating an environment where even minor arguments can turn deadly. He also promised to boost funding for the police - a move that may anger some on the left. With an eye on 2022, however, the White House may be calculating that inoculating itself from Republican attacks is worth the risk of intra-party unrest. Gun sales increased last year, as did reports of domestic violence. According to Mr Asher, there was also evidence that Americans carried firearms more frequently in 2020. Data on the causes of murders in 2020 is not yet widely available, Mr Asher said, but in 2019, 74% of homicides were gun-related. On the eve of Mr Biden's speech, the Department of Justice announced a new team aimed at tackling gun trafficking in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, Washington DC and San Francisco. In New York City, Democratic politicians vying to become the next mayor have largely focused on the issue of law and order, which was widely condemned as a racial dog whistle when it was the theme of Republican former President Donald Trump's election campaign. Ex-police officer Eric Adams is currently in the lead as results are being tallied. This video can not be played What's at stake in the NYC mayoral election? New Yorkers explain.

Palace admits it 'must do more' on staff diversity,"Buckingham Palace has said it ""must do more"" as it revealed its levels of ethnic minority staff for the first time. The Royal Household's annual financial accounts for 2020-21 show 8.5% of its staff are from an ethnic minority background. Its 2022 target is 10%. This compares with around 13% of the UK population, according to the latest 2011 census. The Palace said it was ""not where it would like to be"" on staff diversity. ""It is not that we have not been progressing diversity and inclusion initiatives during this period, it is that simply the results have not been what we would like,"" a Palace source said. They said the household had published the figures so there could be ""no place to hide"", and so they would be held accountable if no progress was made in the future. The source added: ""Her Majesty and other members of the Royal Family have actively promoted and embraced the diversity of our nation and that of the Commonwealth, and we take our lead from that."" Where does the Queen get her money? In London, where the majority of royal workers are based, just under 40% of the population is from an ethnic minority - but 8.5% of the royal staff are. ""Could do better"" is the Palace's own verdict. ""We recognise we are not where we want to be and we want to improve,"" a senior Palace source said. Next year's target is 10%. But change may be hard to achieve. While public funding has remained steady, the extra money the monarch made from things like paid visits to the palaces fell by half. A Â£10m shortfall was covered by cutting back on some events like garden parties and by a recruitment freeze. Without new faces it is difficult to change the profile of household staff; and the Palace reckons that Covid restrictions will hit its supplementary income for some time to come. Raj Tulsiani, co-founder of Race Equality Matters, said the Palace did not ""deserve a pat on the back"" for saying it hopes to improve. ""Amplifying aspirations for future inclusion, it's nothing. It's just words,"" he said. Pointing out that there was no breakdown of the 8.5% figure, he suggested there could be a ""vastly higher percentage of people in lower paid jobs than there are in positions of power and influence"". Graham Smith, chief executive officer of campaign group Republic, which calls for an elected head of state, welcomed the publication of the data but said staff were ""not protected from race discrimination"". ""There is no justification why anyone should be given an exemption from workplace discrimination laws, particularly our head of state,"" he said. The release of the data comes more than three months after the Duke and Duchess of Sussex made allegations of racism within the Royal Family. Prince Harry and Meghan's interview with Oprah Winfreyin March included claims they had been asked how dark their son's skin would be before his birth. The duchess said there had been ""concerns and conversations about how dark [Archie's] skin might be when he was born"". Both Prince Harry and Meghan refused to say who made the comment - but Harry later clarified to Oprah that it was not the Queen or the Duke of Edinburgh. In response, Buckingham Palacedescribed those issues as particularly ""concerning"", saying they would be ""taken very seriously and will be addressed by the family privately"". The Duke of Cambridge later saidthe royals were ""very much not a racist family""in response to questions about the interview. Buckingham Palace introduced a change to its Diversity Strategy in early 2020, before the interview, to emphasise inclusion. After the Winfrey interview,sources said Buckingham Palace was reviewing diversity policiesacross all royal households. The work is looking at improving diversity at Buckingham Palace, Clarence House - the Prince of Wales's household - and Kensington Palace - Prince William's household. A Clarence House senior spokesperson said its proportion of ethnic minority staff was also 8%, adding: ""It isn't good enough and we are determined to do better."" Kensington Palace has not released its staff diversity figures. Royal sources have previously stressed that the Palace already has policies, procedures and programmes in place - but possible changes being considered include the appointment of a ""diversity chief"". The royal accounts are published annually to detail how the yearly payment the Queen receives from the government, known as the Sovereign Grant, is spent. Last year the grant was Â£85.9m - the equivalent of Â£1.29 per person in the UK. The money pays for official royal duties and property maintenance. The payment is based on the profits of the Crown Estate, an independent property business that includes much of London's West End. Normally the Queen receives 15% of the profits. However, that has been increased to 25% until 2027 to help pay for a Â£369m refurbishment of Buckingham Palace. Â£85.9 million - The total taxpayer-funded Sovereign Grant, made up of Â£51.5 million for the ""core"" funding and an extra Â£34.4 million for the re-servicing of Buckingham Palace 113 - Official engagements carried out by the Queen in the last financial year - 183 less or a decline of 62% compared to the 296 carried out in 2019-2020 Almost 1,470 - Official engagements by the royals in the UK and overseas 508 - Full-time equivalent staff paid for from the Sovereign Grant, with the wage bill coming to Â£24.1 million Â£900,000 - Cost of housekeeping and hospitality for the Royal Household - a fall of Â£1.7 million or 65% Â£3.2 million - Cost of official royal travel, a fall of Â£2.1 million - 40% - from Â£5.3 million the previous year Â£47,965 - Cost of travel for William and Kate's royal train tour to Scotland Royal accounts show potential Â£35m Covid shortfall How much taxpayer money goes to the Royals?

Claim that SA woman gave birth to 10 babies false,"Gosiame Thamara Sithole was pictured in May by Pretoria News A claim that South African woman Gosiame Sithole gave birth to 10 babies earlier this month is not true, an official inquiry has found. No hospitals in Gauteng province have a record of decuplets being born, the provincial government says. Medical tests show that Ms Sithole had not even been pregnant recently, it said. The 37-year-old is now being held under the mental health act for observation and will be provided with support. The statement did not elaborate on the reasons behind the fabrication of the story. BBC Africa Live: Updates from the continent Independent Online (IOL), the media group which owns the Pretoria News that first reported the story,had stood by its reporting,external. It went on to allege that Ms Sithole delivered the children on 7 June at Steve Biko Academic Hospital (SBAH) in the capital, Pretoria, saying staff were ill prepared. It accused the hospital and the provincial health authorities of trying to cover up medical negligence. ""These allegations are false, unsubstantiated and only serve to tarnish the  good reputation of Steve Biko Academic Hospital and the Gauteng Provincial Government,"" the latest statement said. Legal action would be taken against the editor-in-chief of Pretoria News, Piet Rampedi, and IOL, it said. Ms Sithole, who has six-year-old twins, and her partner Teboho Tsotetsi lived in Thembisa, a township with many working-class residents in Gauteng province near Johannesburg. According to IOL, they attended the same church as Rampedi where he was introduced to them in December. In May it is alleged he interviewed the couple who said they were expecting eight babies - a photoshoot shows Ms Sithole looking heavily pregnant. The birth of a surprise 10 babies was announced by Pretoria News on 8 June quoting Mr Tsotetsi as the source. He later said he had received text messages from his partner telling him about it, adding he was not allowed at the hospital because of coronavirus restrictions. Rampedi also relied on WhatsApp messages - and did not get independent confirmation from the hospital of the story. Their local mayor then confirmed the births - which is when other outlets,including the BBC, published the story - but a government spokesman later said the politician only had the family's word and no-one had yet seen the babies. Donations began flooding in for the couple and their reported babies, dubbed the ""Thembisa 10"", including 1m rand ($70,000; Â£50,000) from IOL chairman Iqbal SurvÃ©. But the story drew suspicion after Pretoria News initially failed to disclose the hospital where the babies were born and a series of hospitals in Gauteng came out to deny their involvement. Ten days after the alleged births, IOL made the accusations against SBAH. The couple seemed to fall out in the aftermath with Mr Tsotetsi reporting her missing and asking people to stop donations a week later, while Ms Sithole accused him of wanting to benefit financially from the babies, the Pretoria News reported. Meanwhile social workers managed to track down Ms Sithole and she was admitted to hospital for tests last Friday, the Gauteng provincial authorities say. A leaked memo seen by News24 alleges thatRampedi has recently apologised to IOL,externalfor ""the reputational damage"" the story has caused the group, saying he should have treated it more like an investigative piece rather than a ""feel-good story"".

Kamala Harris to make first trip to Mexico borderThe US vice-president has faced repeated questions about why she has not visited the border.US & Canada,"Ms Harris visited Guatemala and Mexico earlier this month US Vice-President Kamala Harris will on Friday make her first trip to the US southern border since taking office. She has faced questions about why she has not visited the boundary since the White House assigned her in March to address the ""root causes"" of migration. The visit was announced a week after former President Donald Trump said he would go to the border on 30 June. The number of undocumented migrants reaching the US-Mexico border is at the highest level in more than 20 years. A BBC investigation of a detention centre for migrant children in El Paso, Texas, has found reports of sexual abuse, Covid and lice outbreaks, hungry children being served undercooked meat and sandstorms engulfing the desert tent camps where the minors are being held. 'Heartbreaking' conditions at US migrant camp Ms Harris will travel to El Paso with Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, according to White House officials. When asked on Wednesday whether Ms Harris was bowing to political pressure, White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said the vice-president was going because the administration had determined now is the ""appropriate time for her to go to the border"" and help ""get the situation under control"". Mr Trump and other Republicans took credit. In a statement Mr Trump said: ""After months of ignoring the crisis at the Southern Border, it is great that we got Kamala Harris to finally go and see the tremendous destruction and death that they've created - a direct result of Biden ending my very tough but fair Border policies. This video can not be played Watch: Texas migrant camp ""kids feel like they're in prison"" ""Harris and Biden were given the strongest Border in American history. ""And now, it is by far the worst in American history. If [Texas] Governor Abbott and I weren't going there next week, she would have never gone!"" The announcement came on the day US Border Patrol chief Rodney Scott said he was leaving his job after less than two years in the position. He had embraced former President Trump's policies, particularly on building a border wall, a project Mr Biden has halted. Earlier this month, Ms Harris made her first trip abroad as vice-president - travelling to Mexico and Guatemala for talks about the humanitarian crisis. The presidents of both countries have blamed the Biden administration's policies for causing the record surge in undocumented migration. The White House has instead said the uptick in arrivals at the border is due to two hurricanes that struck the region last year and the coronavirus pandemic, along with the poverty, violence and corruption that experts have long cited as a driver of such migration. Ms Harris has rejected criticism over why she has not gone to the border until now by arguing she is more focused on tackling the conditions in Central America that have spurred hundreds of thousands of migrants to make the perilous trek this year. Harris tells Guatemala migrants: 'Do not come' Migrant numbers at US border hit new record high While Republicans have led a chorus of criticism of Ms Harris, some Democrats have also urged her to make the trip. Congressman Henry Cuellar, whose constituency spans part of the southern border, wrote to the vice-president this month inviting her to ""observe the ongoing humanitarian crisis and share the perspective of Americans who live there"". The border situation is proving politically troublesome for the Biden administration. An AP-NORC poll in April found that 40% of Americans disapprove of how the president is handling unaccompanied child migrants at the border. During her recent trip abroad, Ms Harris became testy when asked by various media about not visiting the border, at one point rolling her eyes at a journalist. While in Guatemala, the vice-president told migrants: ""Do not come. The United States will continue to enforce our laws and secure our border."" Critics across the political spectrum said her remarks had contradicted the Biden administration's promise to usher in a more humane approach on migration. US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) said it caught 180,034 migrants in May, the biggest monthly total since 2000, and up slightly from the previous two months. A man detained in Arizona wears a T-shirt saying ""please let us in"" Most of them were expelled under a Trump pandemic policy known as Title 42, which was kept in place by Mr Biden. Since coming into office, Mr Biden has repealed Mr Trump's Remain in Mexico policy, which required US asylum seekers to wait in Mexico while their applications were processed. On Tuesday, the Biden administration said asylum seekers whose cases were rejected in the Trump era could have their claims reconsidered, in a move that could benefit tens of thousands of applicants. The president has also urged Congress to create a path to citizenship for the millions of illegal immigrants already in the US.

Biden unveils strategy to combat US crime wave,"This video can not be played Watch Biden talk about the ""blood of patriots"" President Joe Biden has unveiled a plan that includes funding more police to combat a nationwide surge in homicides, which he blamed on lax gun control. He said officials in high crime areas can hire more law-enforcement personnel using coronavirus relief funding. Mr Biden's crime-fighting strategy calls for curtailing rogue gun dealers and firearms trafficking. Republicans are depicting Mr Biden's Democrats as weak on crime, amid calls by left-wingers to defund the police. Announcing his five-point strategy at the White House on Wednesday, the president urged cities and states to use $350bn (Â£250bn) of funding from a Covid-19 relief bill on public safety efforts, including adding more police officers, even beyond pre-pandemic levels. ""It means more police officers, more nurses, more counsellors, more social workers or community violence interrupters to help resolve issues before they escalate into crimes,"" the president said. Some members of Mr Biden's party have amplified calls by Black Lives Matter activists to defund the police, though the president himself has resisted the slogan, which is unpopular with most voters. Mr Biden - who as a senator wrote a 1994 crime bill widely blamed for mass incarceration of black people - said on Wednesday: ""This is not a time to turn our backs on law enforcement or our communities."" Unless tamed, the crime wave is likely to become a major issue ahead of next year's congressional mid-term elections. America's gun culture in charts Is the US seeing a surge in violent crime? Former officers explain killings by police During his remarks at the White House, the president also took aim at armed insurrectionists, saying they would ""need F-15s and maybe some nuclear weapons"" to take on the US government.

The administration's strategy also proposes investing in community violence intervention programmes, employment opportunities and summer activities for teenagers and young adults, and support for formerly incarcerated Americans re-entering their communities. The president recently hosted several big city mayors at the White House for a discussion on crime prevention. In March, the FBI released preliminary 2020 statistics showing a significant jump - 25% - in murders from the year before. So far, the upward trend has continued into 2021. The bureau will release its official numbers in September. If early projections bear out, it will be one of the largest homicide increases ever reported. ""This was a large scale national increase in violence,"" Jeff Asher, co-founder of AH Datalytics and a former analyst for the CIA and Department of Defense, told the BBC. Some analysts have blamed the wave of homicides on the Covid-19 pandemic, althoughresearch indicates,externalthat global crime rates outside the US fell or were stable amid all the lockdowns. Other analysts see the cause as low police morale after the murder of George Floyd last year in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and the ensuing civil unrest that swept US cities. A University of Utah study pinpointed,externalthe spike in US homicides to late May 2020, when Mr Floyd was killed by an officer. But even with this steep rise, the murder rate is still far lower than in the early 1990s, when it was almost double the current figure. And crime overall - including rapes, robbery and other property crime - dropped by about 6% in 2020, among the largest decreases on record. There are a few political issues that, when they reach a boiling point, crowd out just about every other subject in national discussion. The economy is one. Crime is another. And while things seem to be looking fairly good for Joe Biden on the former, an uptick in violent crime could be a serious challenge for Democrats ahead of next year's mid-term elections. Criminal statisticians will point out that the current murder rates are still low compared to previous decades, including the 1990s, when Biden - then a senator - made ""getting tough on crime"" one of his top issues. The general public, however, typically doesn't have such long-term perspective. Republicans have offered an explanation - that the anti-law-enforcement rhetoric and ""defund the police"" efforts from last year's Black Lives Matters demonstrations have led to the current situation. On Wednesday, Biden offered a counter-argument, that lax gun regulations are to blame, creating an environment where even minor arguments can turn deadly. He also promised to boost funding for the police - a move that may anger some on the left. With an eye on 2022, however, the White House may be calculating that inoculating itself from Republican attacks is worth the risk of intra-party unrest. Gun sales increased last year, as did reports of domestic violence. According to Mr Asher, there was also evidence that Americans carried firearms more frequently in 2020. Data on the causes of murders in 2020 is not yet widely available, Mr Asher said, but in 2019, 74% of homicides were gun-related. On the eve of Mr Biden's speech, the Department of Justice announced a new team aimed at tackling gun trafficking in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, Washington DC and San Francisco. In New York City, Democratic politicians vying to become the next mayor have largely focused on the issue of law and order, which was widely condemned as a racial dog whistle when it was the theme of Republican former President Donald Trump's election campaign. Ex-police officer Eric Adams is currently in the lead as results are being tallied. This video can not be played What's at stake in the NYC mayoral election? New Yorkers explain.

Kamala Harris to make first trip to Mexico border,"Ms Harris visited Guatemala and Mexico earlier this month US Vice-President Kamala Harris will on Friday make her first trip to the US southern border since taking office. She has faced questions about why she has not visited the boundary since the White House assigned her in March to address the ""root causes"" of migration. The visit was announced a week after former President Donald Trump said he would go to the border on 30 June. The number of undocumented migrants reaching the US-Mexico border is at the highest level in more than 20 years. A BBC investigation of a detention centre for migrant children in El Paso, Texas, has found reports of sexual abuse, Covid and lice outbreaks, hungry children being served undercooked meat and sandstorms engulfing the desert tent camps where the minors are being held. 'Heartbreaking' conditions at US migrant camp Ms Harris will travel to El Paso with Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, according to White House officials. When asked on Wednesday whether Ms Harris was bowing to political pressure, White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said the vice-president was going because the administration had determined now is the ""appropriate time for her to go to the border"" and help ""get the situation under control"". Mr Trump and other Republicans took credit. In a statement Mr Trump said: ""After months of ignoring the crisis at the Southern Border, it is great that we got Kamala Harris to finally go and see the tremendous destruction and death that they've created - a direct result of Biden ending my very tough but fair Border policies. This video can not be played Watch: Texas migrant camp ""kids feel like they're in prison"" ""Harris and Biden were given the strongest Border in American history. ""And now, it is by far the worst in American history. If [Texas] Governor Abbott and I weren't going there next week, she would have never gone!"" The announcement came on the day US Border Patrol chief Rodney Scott said he was leaving his job after less than two years in the position. He had embraced former President Trump's policies, particularly on building a border wall, a project Mr Biden has halted. Earlier this month, Ms Harris made her first trip abroad as vice-president - travelling to Mexico and Guatemala for talks about the humanitarian crisis. The presidents of both countries have blamed the Biden administration's policies for causing the record surge in undocumented migration. The White House has instead said the uptick in arrivals at the border is due to two hurricanes that struck the region last year and the coronavirus pandemic, along with the poverty, violence and corruption that experts have long cited as a driver of such migration. Ms Harris has rejected criticism over why she has not gone to the border until now by arguing she is more focused on tackling the conditions in Central America that have spurred hundreds of thousands of migrants to make the perilous trek this year. Harris tells Guatemala migrants: 'Do not come' Migrant numbers at US border hit new record high While Republicans have led a chorus of criticism of Ms Harris, some Democrats have also urged her to make the trip. Congressman Henry Cuellar, whose constituency spans part of the southern border, wrote to the vice-president this month inviting her to ""observe the ongoing humanitarian crisis and share the perspective of Americans who live there"". The border situation is proving politically troublesome for the Biden administration. An AP-NORC poll in April found that 40% of Americans disapprove of how the president is handling unaccompanied child migrants at the border. During her recent trip abroad, Ms Harris became testy when asked by various media about not visiting the border, at one point rolling her eyes at a journalist. While in Guatemala, the vice-president told migrants: ""Do not come. The United States will continue to enforce our laws and secure our border."" Critics across the political spectrum said her remarks had contradicted the Biden administration's promise to usher in a more humane approach on migration. US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) said it caught 180,034 migrants in May, the biggest monthly total since 2000, and up slightly from the previous two months. A man detained in Arizona wears a T-shirt saying ""please let us in"" Most of them were expelled under a Trump pandemic policy known as Title 42, which was kept in place by Mr Biden. Since coming into office, Mr Biden has repealed Mr Trump's Remain in Mexico policy, which required US asylum seekers to wait in Mexico while their applications were processed. On Tuesday, the Biden administration said asylum seekers whose cases were rejected in the Trump era could have their claims reconsidered, in a move that could benefit tens of thousands of applicants. The president has also urged Congress to create a path to citizenship for the millions of illegal immigrants already in the US.

PM criticised for 'jabber' jibe in rape exchanges,"This video can not be played Keir Starmer says rape convictions and prosecutions are at a ârecord lowâ Labour is demanding an apology from Boris Johnson over a ""disgraceful"" remark in a clash with Sir Keir Starmer about a big fall in rape prosecutions. Questioned about the government's record, in his final answer at PMQs, Mr Johnson said: ""They jabber, we jab."" Labour's Jess Phillips said the remark showed he did not take tackling sexual violence against women seriously. No 10 insisted the PM was making a broader attack on Labour's tendency to talk about issues but not take action. At Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Johnson denied claims by Sir Keir Starmer that budget cuts were to blame for the fact that rape prosecutions in England and Wales have more than halved since 2016. Rape prosecutions debate fact-checked Ministers 'deeply ashamed' of rape conviction rates Sort rape convictions or go, Labour tells Buckland Why are rape prosecutions falling? He said it was down to ""evidential difficulties"" and a lack of ""joined-up"" working in the criminal justice system, rather than a lack of cash. This would appear to contradict his own justice secretary Robert Buckland, whotold the BBC last week cuts were ""self-evidently"" a factor, as he announced plans to fix the system. Sir Keir - who is the former head of the Crown Prosecution Service - said: ""On the prime minister's watch, rape prosecution and convictions are at a record low, court backlogs are at a record high, victims are waiting longer for justice and criminals are getting away with it. ""This wasn't inevitable, it's the cost of a decade of Conservative cuts and even now the government isn't showing the urgency and ambition that's needed."" He said that 98.6% of reported rapes did not end in charges or a sentence, which he called an ""appalling"" record. Mr Johnson apologised to rape survivors and victims ""for the trauma they have been through"" and the ""frustrations"" they feel at the ""inadequacies"" of the criminal justice system. He said the government was putting money into clearing court backlogs and a plan to improve rape conviction rates. And he accused Labour of not supporting tougher sentences for serious sexual and violent offenders. He ended the exchanges with an attack on Labour and praise for the government's coronavirus vaccination programme, saying: ""We are getting on with the job, they jabber, we jab."" This prompted an angry response from Labour's shadow minister for domestic violence and safeguarding, Jess Phillips. ""For the prime minister to describe questions about rape convictions as 'jabber' is disgraceful,"" said Ms Phillips. She called on the PM to apologise for his words, claiming he ""simply doesn't care about tackling sexual violence"". She later appeared in the Commons to make a point of order calling for the PM to apologise and ""correct the record"" over his claims about Labour's voting record. Labour's shadow justice secretary David Lammy said the PM's ""idiotic jibe"" was a ""total disgrace"", and showed how little he cared about the issue. Earlier, Victims' Commissioner for England and Wales, Dame Vera Baird, told the Home Affairs Committee the government'slong-awaited rape reviewwas ""underwhelming"" but also a ""watershed moment"". She said there was a ""very large amount of kicking the can down the road"" but the apology made by ministers for falling prosecution rates was ""powerful"" and campaigners were seeing that as a ""signal of intent"". She said as long as the ""strength"" of that apology survived then she was hopeful ""we can really bring a change...and drive the government further"". But the treatment of victims was ""appalling"", she added, with police forces focusing on whether the victim was credible and not the defendant. Last week, Home Secretary Priti Patel said ministers were ""deeply ashamed"" of falling conviction rates and joined Mr Buckland in apologising for the situation and promising to ""do much better"". Asked in a BBC interview whether government cuts to the legal system were a factor, Mr Buckland said: ""Like all parts of public service big choices were made in the last decade, because of the position that we all faced economically and that's, I think, self-evidently the case."" He said the government was now ""seeking to make the necessary investment"" but also insisted ""it's about more than just money, it's about culture."" He argued that ""for too long"" rape allegations have focused on the credibility of the victim rather than the evidence.

Britney Spears speaks out against conservatorship,"The singer said she felt ""forced"" to perform and was punished when she spoke out US pop star Britney Spears has launched a blistering attack on the ""abusive"" conservatorship that has controlled her life for 13 years. She said she was traumatised and cried every day, telling a judge in Los Angeles: ""I just want my life back"". Spears, 39, also said she had been denied the right to have more children and was put on the psychiatric drug lithium against her wishes. Her father was granted control over her affairs by court order in 2008. The order was granted after the star was put in hospital amid concerns over her mental health, and it has been extended for more than a decade since. Britney Spears: Everything she said in court Timberlake leads outpouring of support for Britney The conservatorship case explained The special hearing on Wednesday was the first time Spears has spoken in open court about her case. Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Brenda Penny thanked Spears for her ""courageous"" words during the proceedings. It followed much speculation about the pop star's situation, with fans eagerly combing her social media output for clues. A fan-led movement, known as #FreeBritney, has campaigned for her legal freedom for years. But along legal process is likely before any decision is made on ending the conservatorship,external, the Associated Press reports. Spears delivered an impassioned address which lasted for more than 20 minutes. After launching into her speech, she was asked by the judge to slow down and later said she wished she could stay on the phone ""forever"" to avoid returning to her life where she was surrounded by people who said no to her. Spears told the court she wanted the conservatorship to end and described the arrangement as ""embarrassing and humiliating"". This video can not be played Britney Spears: Fans speak out against conservatorship Referring to past Instagram posts, the singer said: ""I've lied and told the whole world I'm okay and I'm happy. ""I've been in denial. I've been in shock. I am traumatised,"" she said. ""I'm not happy. I can't sleep. I'm so angry it's insane. And I'm depressed. I cry every day."" Spears, a mother of two, said she wanted to marry her boyfriend and have another baby, but the conservatorship would not allow her to. She accused her conservator of stopping her from having a contraceptive intrauterine device (IUD) removed so she could get pregnant. ""I feel ganged up on and I feel bullied and I feel left out and alone,"" she told the court. ""I deserve to have the same rights as anybody does, by having a child, a family, any of those things."" Spears said she felt ""forced"" to tour by her management. She said she spoke out against going straight onto a Las Vegas residency, and her therapist was falsely told she was not co-operating or taking her medication. She alleged she was then put on the drug lithium -a common medicine for bipolar disorder,external- against her wishes and it had made her feel drunk and unable to converse. Spears said it was her belief that the conservatorship was doing her ""way more harm than good"" and said she ""honestly didn't know"" she could petition for the arrangement to end. The full extent of why the court order was extended has never been made public. But Spears has maintained a public career, including a Las Vegas residency and a stint as an X-Factor judge, leading many to question the validity of the arrangement. #FreeBritney campaigners gathered on Wednesday in support of Ms Spears A lawyer for her father, Jamie Spears, said he had been troubled by the singer's allegations in court. ""He is sorry to see his daughter suffering and in so much pain,"" the lawyer said in a statement read out in court. ""Mr Spears loves his daughter, and he misses her very much."" A conservatorship is granted by a court for individuals who are unable to make their own decisions, such as those with dementia or other mental illnesses. Spears' conservatorship is split into two parts - one is for her estate and financial affairs, the other is for her as a person. Under the agreement, the pop star has not controlled her finances since 2008. That is around the time she began to behave erratically amid her divorce from Kevin Federline and a custody battle over their children. The star made headlines in a series of public incidents, including shaving her head, and she was twice admitted to hospital. 1998 Britney Spears, 16, catapults to the top of global pop charts with her debut single ...Baby One More Time. More than 20 years later, her debut album of the same name remains the best-selling album by a teenage solo artist. February 2007 Spears is hounded by the press amid a tumultuous custody dispute with ex-husband Kevin Federline, allegations that she is an unfit mother and questions about her mental health. Amid the tabloid frenzy, she is captured on camera shaving her head. A few days later, she smashes a paparazzoâs SUV repeatedly with an umbrella. 2008 After stints in hospital and rehab, Spearsâ father Jamie petitions a Los Angeles court to place his daughter under a temporary conservatorship. He is charged with making decisions about her career, as well as her estate and financial affairs. The conservatorship is extended indefinitely later that year. 2013 Despite being unable to handle her own affairs, Spears continues to work. After rehabilitating her image with a successful seventh studio album and several appearances on television, she begins a four-year concert residency in Las Vegas. 2019-2020 Spears says she is taking a break from work because of her fatherâs health issues. Later in the year, Jamie Spears steps away as her conservator temporarily, citing his poor health. Britney Spears indicates through her lawyers that she no longer wants her father to be involved in handling her career. A lawyer says Spears is “afraid of her father” and will not return to the stage as long as he retains control. February 2021 A New York Times documentary about the pop starâs rise and fall, as well as about her treatment by the media, generates mass public interest in her conservatorship. June-July 2021 In explosive court testimony, Britney Spears alleges she was drugged, forced to perform against her will and prevented from having more children under the conservatorship. She says she will not perform again while her father retains control over her career, and officially requests for him to be replaced as her conservator. August 2021 Jamie Spears says he is ready to step down as his daughter's conservator “when the time is right"" and pledges to participate in an ""orderly transition”. He later asks the court if the conservatorship itself should continue, saying his daughter should be given the chance to manage her own affairs. September 2021 At a court in Los Angeles, a judge suspends Jamie Spears from the legal arrangement that gave him control over his daughterâs life. Jamie Spears stepped down temporarily as his daughter's personal conservator in 2019 due to health reasons. She sought to permanently install Jodi Montgomery, a care professional, into the role instead of reinstating her father - but on Wednesday she said Ms Montgomery was ""even starting to take it too far"". Her father remains co-conservator of her estate, along with the financial firm the Bessemer Trust. Mr Spears's legal team has insisted he has done a good job of managing his daughter's finances. But a court-appointed lawyer for the pop star said she is afraid of him and will not return to the stage as long as he remains in control of her career. Spears said Wednesday that she believed her father ""he loved the control to hurt his own daughter 100,000%"". Dozens of fans gathered outside court on Wednesday, holding signs that read ""Free Britney now!"" and ""Get out of Britney's life!"" ""Everything she said was absolutely heartbreaking and it was actually even worse than I really thought it was,"" Megan Radford, one of the movement's founders, told the BBC. David Willis, BBC News, Los Angeles Britney Spears unleashed on a stunned courtroom the equivalent of 13 years of pent-up frustration - a torrent of accusation, anger and regret, all delivered in such a breathless monologue that at times the judge had to ask her to slow down. She came across as isolated, lost and lonely; a superstar that has been relentlessly manipulated. We knew that she had asked to put her case directly to the judge, but few could have predicted such a tirade. It amounted to a withering critique of the conservatorship process and the motives of many - members of her family chief among them - who were supposed to have been caring for her. Both the #FreeBritney movement and the recent release of a New York Times documentary about the singer have renewed public interest in the case. The pop star has never commented directly on her conservatorship battle, with her online persona remaining upbeat. A lawyer for the singer's mother, Lynne, has asked for her daughter's wishes to be heard Court records from 2019, the last time she spoke in court, have never been made public.But earlier this week the New York Times said it had obtained confidential court documents,externalthat showed the singer had opposed the restrictions since 2014. The newspaper also reported that the singer felt she was forced to stay at a mental health facility in 2019 on exaggerated grounds which she viewed as punishment for standing up for herself. In April, the pop star asked to address the court through her court-appointed attorney. A number of celebrities have posted messages of support. Pop star Justin Timberlake, her boyfriend in the 1990s, posted a thread of tweets,externalcalling for people to stand by her: ""We should all be supporting Britney at this time. Regardless of our past, good and bad, and no matter how long ago it wasâ¦ what's happening to her is just not right."" Timberlake made a public apology to Spearsearlier this year after the New York Times documentary suggested he had treated her disrespectfully by discussing their sex life on the radio. Spears's current boyfriend, the personal trainer and actor Sam Asghari, posted a picture on Instagram of himself in Free Britney T-Shirt. Singer Mariah Carey tweeted: ""We love you Britney!!! Stay strong."" Rose McGowan, the actor and MeToo activist, said Spears had every right to be angry, adding: ""How would you feel if your life was stolen, dissected, mocked? STOP CONTROLLING WOMEN.""

Biden unveils strategy to combat US crime waveMr Biden's plan comes as gun sales and homicides have spiked around the country this year.US & Canada,"This video can not be played Watch Biden talk about the ""blood of patriots"" President Joe Biden has unveiled a plan that includes funding more police to combat a nationwide surge in homicides, which he blamed on lax gun control. He said officials in high crime areas can hire more law-enforcement personnel using coronavirus relief funding. Mr Biden's crime-fighting strategy calls for curtailing rogue gun dealers and firearms trafficking. Republicans are depicting Mr Biden's Democrats as weak on crime, amid calls by left-wingers to defund the police. Announcing his five-point strategy at the White House on Wednesday, the president urged cities and states to use $350bn (Â£250bn) of funding from a Covid-19 relief bill on public safety efforts, including adding more police officers, even beyond pre-pandemic levels. ""It means more police officers, more nurses, more counsellors, more social workers or community violence interrupters to help resolve issues before they escalate into crimes,"" the president said. Some members of Mr Biden's party have amplified calls by Black Lives Matter activists to defund the police, though the president himself has resisted the slogan, which is unpopular with most voters. Mr Biden - who as a senator wrote a 1994 crime bill widely blamed for mass incarceration of black people - said on Wednesday: ""This is not a time to turn our backs on law enforcement or our communities."" Unless tamed, the crime wave is likely to become a major issue ahead of next year's congressional mid-term elections. America's gun culture in charts Is the US seeing a surge in violent crime? Former officers explain killings by police During his remarks at the White House, the president also took aim at armed insurrectionists, saying they would ""need F-15s and maybe some nuclear weapons"" to take on the US government. The Biden administration has proposed gun control as a remedy for violent crime, although Democratic bills in Congress to limit Americans' access to firearms have been blocked by Republicans. The administration's strategy also proposes investing in community violence intervention programmes, employment opportunities and summer activities for teenagers and young adults, and support for formerly incarcerated Americans re-entering their communities. The president recently hosted several big city mayors at the White House for a discussion on crime prevention. In March, the FBI released preliminary 2020 statistics showing a significant jump - 25% - in murders from the year before. So far, the upward trend has continued into 2021. The bureau will release its official numbers in September. If early projections bear out, it will be one of the largest homicide increases ever reported. ""This was a large scale national increase in violence,"" Jeff Asher, co-founder of AH Datalytics and a former analyst for the CIA and Department of Defense, told the BBC. Some analysts have blamed the wave of homicides on the Covid-19 pandemic, althoughresearch indicates,externalthat global crime rates outside the US fell or were stable amid all the lockdowns. Other analysts see the cause as low police morale after the murder of George Floyd last year in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and the ensuing civil unrest that swept US cities. A University of Utah study pinpointed,externalthe spike in US homicides to late May 2020, when Mr Floyd was killed by an officer. But even with this steep rise, the murder rate is still far lower than in the early 1990s, when it was almost double the current figure. And crime overall - including rapes, robbery and other property crime - dropped by about 6% in 2020, among the largest decreases on record. There are a few political issues that, when they reach a boiling point, crowd out just about every other subject in national discussion. The economy is one. Crime is another. And while things seem to be looking fairly good for Joe Biden on the former, an uptick in violent crime could be a serious challenge for Democrats ahead of next year's mid-term elections. Criminal statisticians will point out that the current murder rates are still low compared to previous decades, including the 1990s, when Biden - then a senator - made ""getting tough on crime"" one of his top issues. The general public, however, typically doesn't have such long-term perspective. Republicans have offered an explanation - that the anti-law-enforcement rhetoric and ""defund the police"" efforts from last year's Black Lives Matters demonstrations have led to the current situation. On Wednesday, Biden offered a counter-argument, that lax gun regulations are to blame, creating an environment where even minor arguments can turn deadly. He also promised to boost funding for the police - a move that may anger some on the left. With an eye on 2022, however, the White House may be calculating that inoculating itself from Republican attacks is worth the risk of intra-party unrest. Gun sales increased last year, as did reports of domestic violence. According to Mr Asher, there was also evidence that Americans carried firearms more frequently in 2020. Data on the causes of murders in 2020 is not yet widely available, Mr Asher said, but in 2019, 74% of homicides were gun-related. On the eve of Mr Biden's speech, the Department of Justice announced a new team aimed at tackling gun trafficking in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, Washington DC and San Francisco. In New York City, Democratic politicians vying to become the next mayor have largely focused on the issue of law and order, which was widely condemned as a racial dog whistle when it was the theme of Republican former President Donald Trump's election campaign.

Exams altered next year after pandemic disruption,"Exams have been cancelled because of the pandemic for two years in a row Next year's A-levels and GCSEs in England are likely to face ""adjustments"" to be fairer to pupils disrupted by the pandemic, the education secretary has told MPs. Gavin Williamson said exams in 2022 would need to be altered so that pupils would not be at a disadvantage. This summer's exams have been cancelled - but he said the expectation was for modified exams to run next year. ""We very much hope and intend exams will go ahead in 2022,"" he said. Facing questions from MPs on the Education Select Committee, Mr Williamson said changes were being considered to next year's exams to ""ensure that there's fairness and there's the right level of support"". ""I very much expect there to be adjustments and mitigations to be put in place. ""Those youngsters who are currently in Year 10 and Year 12 will have suffered disruption as a result of the pandemic,"" he said. As such, Mr Williamson said it was not possible to ""immediately switch back to the situation as it was back in 2019"", in the exams taken before the pandemic. Exam grading could become 'wild west' warn MPs Teachers' grades for cancelled exams The big U-turn over last summer's exams The education secretary suggested that some of the ideas which would have been used for this year's exams, before they were cancelled, could be applied. Those included slimming down some of the subject areas to be tested, pushing back the dates of exams to increase lesson time, and looking at ways of reflecting that students would have covered different amounts of their courses. ""We'll look at a similar set of measures that can be brought forward in order to support pupils as they take assessments,"" he told MPs. Gavin Williamson, speaking to MPs online, said exam changes would be likely for another year Head teachers' leader Geoff Barton said it was right to ""prevent these young people from being disadvantaged by this turbulence"". ""There is also a big question over what happens in September if educational disruption continues next academic year, because this too will need to be taken into account in terms of next summer's exams,"" he said. Committee member Caroline Johnson asked about grade inflation this year - and whether pupils would get a fair outcome if many high grades were awarded. The MP said parents had also told her there were more replacement assessments being taken than if exams had gone ahead. Mr Williamson said that exams had been cancelled with ""incredible reluctance"" but that replacement measures were in place to ensure consistency and fairness. ""Looking across all the different routes that we could take, we felt that teacher-assessed grades, putting our trust in teachers, was the absolute best approach,"" he said. Teachers' grades have been submitted to exam boards - but Mr Williamson said he had no early sight of how grades were looking, and there was no data yet to show whether grades were going to be higher. MPs also pressed on the question of catch-up funding - after the catch-up tsar, Sir Kevan Collins, resigned over a lack of financial support for his plans. Ian Mearns warned of a ""half-hearted"" commitment to schools, when proposals for a Â£15bn catch-up initiative only delivered Â£3bn, including new and previously announced funding. Mr Williamson suggested there would be further support for schools, but that would depend on the next spending review. The education secretary also told MPs that plans for a register of home-educated children would be announced imminently. A consultation on such a register was launched more than two years ago.

Man Utd increase Sancho offer to Â£72.6mManchester United increase their offer for Jadon Sancho to 85m Euros (Â£72.6m) but it is still short of Borussia Dortmund's valuation of the England winger.,"Sancho (right) and England team-mate Jude Bellingham helped Borussia Dortmund win the German Cup final in May Manchester United have increased their offer for Borussia Dortmund's Jadon Sancho to 85m euros (Â£72.6m). United have already hadone bid for the 21-year-old England winger turned downand their latest is still 10m euros short of the German club's valuation. However, while the latest bid is unlikely to be accepted, it is now viewed as virtually certain the transfer will eventually be concluded. Sancho is currently part of England's squad at Euro 2020. Dortmund have a gentleman's agreement with him that he will be allowed to leave this summer if a club meets his valuation. Although Sancho has been restricted to a single short substitute appearance at Euro 2020, his performances at Dortmund have been massively impressive and sources at United see no reason why that cannot be replicated in the Premier League. Sancho has scored 50 goals in 137 games for Dortmund, plus three goals in 20 caps for England. In the past three seasons, he has been involved in 109 goals with Dortmund and scored twice whenthey beat RB Leipzig to win the German Cup finalin May. Manchester United missed out on signing Sancho 12 months ago, when they were quoted a fee by Dortmund for Sancho, then tried to reduce it believing the Bundesliga side would eventually sell for a lower price. In the end, the German club refused to budge and Sancho remained where he was. Sancho joined Borussia Dortmund from Manchester City for Â£10m in August 2017. City negotiated a 15% sell-on clause as part of the deal and will receive it for the total fee rather than just the profit.

Travel industry protests against Covid restrictions,"Travel industry employees are holding a series of protests around the country against coronavirus restrictions. Airlines and travel companies say current limits on travel have had a devastating impact on the sector. Ministers are due to update the traffic light system for international travel on Thursday amid calls for more countries to join the green list. The government said it continued to explore how it could open international travel safely. Most holiday destinations, including Spain, Greece and Italy, are on the government's amber list, meaning travellers have to quarantine when they return to the the UK. As a result, the travel industry has dramatically scaled back its operations. If I've had both jabs, will I be able to travel freely? How can I prove I've had both my Covid jabs? Scramble to return as Portugal joins amber list On Wednesday cabin crew, pilots, travel agents, airport staff and industry heads held what they described as a day of action. Airport staff stood with placards on empty runways while others protested outside Westminster, Holyrood and Stormont. They called on the government to offer the industry more financial support and increase the number of countries on the UK's green list, allowing passengers to travel without having to quarantine on their return. One of the backers of the day of action was industry trade body Abta. The organisation's chief executive Mark Tanzer told the BBC: ""The industry is going to need support to get through these critical months, particularly the summer season which is where most of the cash would normally come in. ""So extending the furlough arrangements for the travel sector, business rates relief and also looking at a really targeted  financial support, a revenue replacement system."" The travel industry is nervous. The Westminster government is expected to announce updates to the green list on Thursday and no industry heads are feeling very optimistic. Conversations do happen regularly between travel bosses and the government, but the industry still feels it is anyone's guess which way the meeting about international travel will swing, and whether any countries will be changed to green. Summer, particularly school holidays, is the time when the industry makes most of its money. That key time is getting closer which is why the industry is getting even louder. But the government has always said that its international travel policy is guided by protecting public health. As long as ministers feel reopening is too much of a risk the green list will remain short. The government said its international travel policy was guided by ""one overwhelming priority - protecting public health"". ""We keep all measures under review and continue to engage with industry and international partners to explore how we can open international travel safely. ""Both tailored and wider economic support is still available to the sector, including the furlough scheme."" Airport bosses want fully vaccinated passengers from amber-list countries to be exempted from quarantine. ""That would be a major step forward and I think it would create the confidence that people need to go ahead and book travel and travel over the summer,"" said Manchester Airports Group chief of staff, Tim Hawkins. ""Other countries are doing that, Germany, France, and at the moment that doesn't apply in the UK but it could and it would open up potential for travel for lots of people over the summer. ""So I think it's really important, but it needs to happen quickly."" One of the demonstrators at Westminster on Wednesday was Lynn Sutherby who works for Virgin Atlantic as one of the cabin crew. Over the last 15 months since start of the Covid pandemic she has been flying on and off and she has also retrained for the ambulance service and as a vaccinator. ""We have aircraft that are flying around empty. Although we're bringing in vital supplies and shipping that around to and from the country we need our customers - we need customers to be able to survive. ""So many jobs are at risk - thousands and thousands of  jobs. We have lots of colleagues who are in holding pools waiting to come back. ""The government need to act and they need to do something to open up travel."" The Transport Secretary has said that he will listen to scientific advice on whether having two vaccinations should enable people to travel internationally. He said the Government will review the data on this shortly. Grant Shapps told the BBC: ""If you've been double vaccinated then of course we need to look at what the science says... We've said that Monday is the point to review that data, so we are coming up to having a look at it."" He said, ""We're looking at it in the next few days and I'll have more to say."" Asked about the travel industry, Mr Shapps said he was ""massively concerned... which is why we've provided Â£7bn of support just for the aviation sector alone"". How are travel rules being relaxed?

"PM criticised for 'jabber' jibe in rape exchangesNo 10 insists Boris Johnson was accusing Labour of talking rather than taking action, at PMQs.","This video can not be played Keir Starmer says rape convictions and prosecutions are at a ârecord lowâ Labour is demanding an apology from Boris Johnson over a ""disgraceful"" remark in a clash with Sir Keir Starmer about a big fall in rape prosecutions. Questioned about the government's record, in his final answer at PMQs, Mr Johnson said: ""They jabber, we jab."" Labour's Jess Phillips said the remark showed he did not take tackling sexual violence against women seriously. No 10 insisted the PM was making a broader attack on Labour's tendency to talk about issues but not take action. At Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Johnson denied claims by Sir Keir Starmer that budget cuts were to blame for the fact that rape prosecutions in England and Wales have more than halved since 2016. Rape prosecutions debate fact-checked Ministers 'deeply ashamed' of rape conviction rates Sort rape convictions or go, Labour tells Buckland Why are rape prosecutions falling? He said it was down to ""evidential difficulties"" and a lack of ""joined-up"" working in the criminal justice system, rather than a lack of cash. This would appear to contradict his own justice secretary Robert Buckland, whotold the BBC last week cuts were ""self-evidently"" a factor, as he announced plans to fix the system. Sir Keir - who is the former head of the Crown Prosecution Service - said: ""On the prime minister's watch, rape prosecution and convictions are at a record low, court backlogs are at a record high, victims are waiting longer for justice and criminals are getting away with it. ""This wasn't inevitable, it's the cost of a decade of Conservative cuts and even now the government isn't showing the urgency and ambition that's needed."" He said that 98.6% of reported rapes did not end in charges or a sentence, which he called an ""appalling"" record. Mr Johnson apologised to rape survivors and victims ""for the trauma they have been through"" and the ""frustrations"" they feel at the ""inadequacies"" of the criminal justice system. He said the government was putting money into clearing court backlogs and a plan to improve rape conviction rates. And he accused Labour of not supporting tougher sentences for serious sexual and violent offenders. He ended the exchanges with an attack on Labour and praise for the government's coronavirus vaccination programme, saying: ""We are getting on with the job, they jabber, we jab."" This prompted an angry response from Labour's shadow minister for domestic violence and safeguarding, Jess Phillips. ""For the prime minister to describe questions about rape convictions as 'jabber' is disgraceful,"" said Ms Phillips. She called on the PM to apologise for his words, claiming he ""simply doesn't care about tackling sexual violence"". She later appeared in the Commons to make a point of order calling for the PM to apologise and ""correct the record"" over his claims about Labour's voting record. Labour's shadow justice secretary David Lammy said the PM's ""idiotic jibe"" was a ""total disgrace"", and showed how little he cared about the issue. Earlier, Victims' Commissioner for England and Wales, Dame Vera Baird, told the Home Affairs Committee the government'slong-awaited rape reviewwas ""underwhelming"" but also a ""watershed moment"". She said there was a ""very large amount of kicking the can down the road"" but the apology made by ministers for falling prosecution rates was ""powerful"" and campaigners were seeing that as a ""signal of intent"". She said as long as the ""strength"" of that apology survived then she was hopeful ""we can really bring a change...and drive the government further"". But the treatment of victims was ""appalling"", she added, with police forces focusing on whether the victim was credible and not the defendant. Last week, Home Secretary Priti Patel said ministers were ""deeply ashamed"" of falling conviction rates and joined Mr Buckland in apologising for the situation and promising to ""do much better"". Asked in a BBC interview whether government cuts to the legal system were a factor, Mr Buckland said: ""Like all parts of public service big choices were made in the last decade, because of the position that we all faced economically and that's, I think, self-evidently the case."" He said the government was now ""seeking to make the necessary investment"" but also insisted ""it's about more than just money, it's about culture."" He argued that ""for too long"" rape allegations have focused on the credibility of the victim rather than the evidence.

"Heavy casualties reported in Ethiopia air strikeEyewitnesses tell the BBC the Ethiopian air force struck a market, which it denies.Africa","More than 40 people were reportedly injured in the air strike Dozens of people have reportedly been killed or injured after Ethiopia's air force bombed a market in the northern region of Tigray. Eyewitnesses told the BBC the Ethiopian air force struck the town of Togoga on Tuesday, 25km (15 miles) from the region's capital, Mekelle. The Ethiopian military denied targeting civilians, saying it carried out the strikes to neutralise ""terrorists"". Tigrayan rebel forces are said to have made advances in recent days. However, this has been denied by the Ethiopian government. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said it helped evacuate the wounded.

Scottish nursing union 'in dispute' over pay,"The RCN said the Scottish government has relied on the good will of nursing staff for too long A nursing union has lodged a formal trade dispute with the Scottish government for the first time in a row over pay. The Royal College of Nursing in Scotland said staff were exhausted, with worrying numbers considering leaving the profession. In May, the Scottish government confirmed an NHS pay deal that will see most workers receive a 4% rise. The RCN union said the single-year deal was imposed despite its rejection. It said the deal fell ""far short"" of the RCN's call for a significant pay rise that applies equally across all bands. Most NHS Scotland staff to receive 4% pay rise Nursing union urges members to reject 4% pay offer The RCN has been calling for a 12.5% pay increase in recognition of the need to fill posts and the complexity and responsibility of the job. In a letter to Health Secretary Humza Yousaf, the RCN's Julie Lamberth wrote that members had ""serious concerns"" about recruitment and retention of the nursing workforce in Scotland. Ms Lamberth said: ""The Scottish government has relied on the good will of nursing staff for too long."" She added: ""Every patient needs and deserves the best quality of care, this can only be safely achieved with the right number of nursing staff with the right skills and expertise."" The trade dispute is a formal expression of nurses' frustration, she said. Health Secretary Humza Yousaf said the notification from the RCN was ""disappointing"" but he looked forward to continuing to engage with them. He said that a clear majority of unions, representing most NHS staff, had accepted the pay deal. ""This 4% increase stands in stark contrast to the paltry 1% on the table from the UK government for nurses in England,"" Mr Yousaf said. The health secretary said he was happy to ""get back round the table"" with the RCN Scottish Labour spokeswoman Jackie Baillie said the pay deal was an opportunity to give nurses the recognition they deserved after decades of under-appreciation. ""Instead their voices have been ignored to the extent that RCN Scotland has had to enter into a trade dispute for the first time in their history,"" she said. ""That they have been forced to this point after the events of the last year and a half is disgraceful."" Scottish Greens health spokeswoman Gillian Mackay said: ""There are over 4,400 nursing vacancies in Scotland. ""It's clear we must urgently improve recruitment and retention of nurses if the NHS is to continue to deliver safe and excellent care and giving nurses the pay rise they deserve will be key to achieving this."" Meanwhile, health workers in other parts of the UK are pressing the prime minister to end their long wait for a pay rise amid continuing anger over the government recommending a 1% increase. Unison is staging a protest at Westminster on Wednesday, saying thousands of health workers across England, Wales and Northern Ireland will be looking to Boris Johnson to announce his decision in the coming days. NHS staff were due a pay rise in April, but ministers said they would await the recommendations of the pay review body, which is expected to deliver its report within days.

Schools encouraged to host 'One Britain' events,"The UK government has encouraged schools to hold a celebratory day this Friday aiming to instil pride in Britishness. One Britain One Nation (OBON) Day, at which children are encouraged to sing a patriotic song, is being promoted by retired police officer Kash Singh. His campaign says it wants to foster a ""spirit of inclusion with a collective purpose"". But Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon called the idea ""ludicrous"". The Department for Education  - which has responsibility for schools in England - said it supported the ""broad aims"" of the day but it was not endorsing any specific materials produced by the campaign. However, it is unclear how many schools will take part in the event on 25 June, which comes as many Scottish schools are due to close for the summer. Ms Sturgeon said the timing of the endorsement showed the UK government's ""disinterest"" in Scotland. Call for school patriotism debate,external Why don't your holidays start at the same time? Mr Singh said he set up the OBON campaign in Bradford, West Yorkshire, in 2013 after retiring from the local police force in 2012. It is asking schools to hold a one-minute clap to recognise ""all those people who helped"" during the Covid pandemic, and get children to sing an ""anthem"". The song, written by primary school pupils in Bradford, features the lyrics: ""We are Britain and we have one dream - to unite all people in one great team"". Another line says Britain is ""united forever, never apart"". The song closes with the refrain: ""Strong Britain, Great Nation"". A brochure for the event also suggests schools could ask pupils to dress in red, white and blue - or hold parades to create a ""shared sense of belonging"". OBON has previously promoted campaigns to celebrate the Queen's 90th birthday in 2016, and the birth of Prince George in 2013. OBON suggests schools could decorate their classrooms in red, white and blue for the day Mr Singh told the BBC Radio 4's PM programme, ""I came to this country at the age of six from Punjab in India - couldn't speak a word of English. ""This is a fantastic country - it has welcomed people from all parts of the world who have made it their home. ""When I left the police force I wanted to put something back into the country that had given me so much - I came up with this concept with no other intention other than to do good for the country."" Responding to criticism, he said the words of the song were written by children aged seven to nine and suggested that politicians should be ""a little more sensitive"". On Monday, the DfE said it wanted schools ""across the UK"" to take part in Mr Singh's event. In a post on Twitter,external, the department added it would help children ""learn about our shared values of tolerance, kindness, pride and respect"". In reply, former Labour MP and universities minister John Denham accused the DfE of ""trying to claim it is [the] UK education department"". And Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she first assumed the UK government's endorsement of the idea was a ""spoof"" when she saw it. Nicola Sturgeon has dismissed the idea of a 'One Britain' day Speaking on Wednesday, she said: ""I'm trying to imagine the outrage there would be if the Scottish government was insisting or even encouraging Scottish school kids to sing some song about how great Scotland is. ""People would be - and rightly so - up in arms about it,"" she added. ""It's ludicrous and it perhaps says everything about the disinterest the UK government has in Scotland that they're asking this to happen on the day Scottish schools go off on their holiday."" A spokesperson for the Labour-run Welsh government, responsible for schools in Wales, said: ""Education is a devolved matter and the Welsh government has not been engaged in this project."" Labour's shadow education secretary Kate Green said: ""Getting a proper plan in place for children's recovery and ensuring every school is being supported to manage the impacts of Covid on their pupils, is Labour's priority and should be the education secretary's priority as well."" A spokesperson for the DfE said it supported OBON's ""broad aims to help children learn about equality, kindness and pride"". ""It is for schools to decide how they teach these important values,"" they added. ""The department has not asked people to sing songs or endorsed any specific materials for One Britain One Nation day.""

Man Utd increase Sancho offer to Â£72.6m,"Sancho (right) and England team-mate Jude Bellingham helped Borussia Dortmund win the German Cup final in May Manchester United have increased their offer for Borussia Dortmund's Jadon Sancho to 85m euros (Â£72.6m). United have already hadone bid for the 21-year-old England winger turned downand their latest is still 10m euros short of the German club's valuation. However, while the latest bid is unlikely to be accepted, it is now viewed as virtually certain the transfer will eventually be concluded. Sancho is currently part of England's squad at Euro 2020. Dortmund have a gentleman's agreement with him that he will be allowed to leave this summer if a club meets his valuation. Although Sancho has been restricted to a single short substitute appearance at Euro 2020, his performances at Dortmund have been massively impressive and sources at United see no reason why that cannot be replicated in the Premier League. Sancho has scored 50 goals in 137 games for Dortmund, plus three goals in 20 caps for England. In the past three seasons, he has been involved in 109 goals with Dortmund and scored twice whenthey beat RB Leipzig to win the German Cup finalin May. Manchester United missed out on signing Sancho 12 months ago, when they were quoted a fee by Dortmund for Sancho, then tried to reduce it believing the Bundesliga side would eventually sell for a lower price. In the end, the German club refused to budge and Sancho remained where he was. Sancho joined Borussia Dortmund from Manchester City for Â£10m in August 2017. City negotiated a 15% sell-on clause as part of the deal and will receive it for the total fee rather than just the profit.

"PM criticised for 'jabber' jibe in rape exchangesNo 10 insists Boris Johnson was accusing Labour of talking rather than taking action, at PMQs.UK Politics","This video can not be played Keir Starmer says rape convictions and prosecutions are at a ârecord lowâ Labour is demanding an apology from Boris Johnson over a ""disgraceful"" remark in a clash with Sir Keir Starmer about a big fall in rape prosecutions. Questioned about the government's record, in his final answer at PMQs, Mr Johnson said: ""They jabber, we jab."" Labour's Jess Phillips said the remark showed he did not take tackling sexual violence against women seriously. No 10 insisted the PM was making a broader attack on Labour's tendency to talk about issues but not take action. At Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Johnson denied claims by Sir Keir Starmer that budget cuts were to blame for the fact that rape prosecutions in England and Wales have more than halved since 2016. Rape prosecutions debate fact-checked Ministers 'deeply ashamed' of rape conviction rates Sort rape convictions or go, Labour tells Buckland Why are rape prosecutions falling? He said it was down to ""evidential difficulties"" and a lack of ""joined-up"" working in the criminal justice system, rather than a lack of cash. This would appear to contradict his own justice secretary Robert Buckland, whotold the BBC last week cuts were ""self-evidently"" a factor, as he announced plans to fix the system. Sir Keir - who is the former head of the Crown Prosecution Service - said: ""On the prime minister's watch, rape prosecution and convictions are at a record low, court backlogs are at a record high, victims are waiting longer for justice and criminals are getting away with it. ""This wasn't inevitable, it's the cost of a decade of Conservative cuts and even now the government isn't showing the urgency and ambition that's needed."" He said that 98.6% of reported rapes did not end in charges or a sentence, which he called an ""appalling"" record. Mr Johnson apologised to rape survivors and victims ""for the trauma they have been through"" and the ""frustrations"" they feel at the ""inadequacies"" of the criminal justice system. He said the government was putting money into clearing court backlogs and a plan to improve rape conviction rates. And he accused Labour of not supporting tougher sentences for serious sexual and violent offenders. He ended the exchanges with an attack on Labour and praise for the government's coronavirus vaccination programme, saying: ""We are getting on with the job, they jabber, we jab."" This prompted an angry response from Labour's shadow minister for domestic violence and safeguarding, Jess Phillips. ""For the prime minister to describe questions about rape convictions as 'jabber' is disgraceful,"" said Ms Phillips. She called on the PM to apologise for his words, claiming he ""simply doesn't care about tackling sexual violence"". She later appeared in the Commons to make a point of order calling for the PM to apologise and ""correct the record"" over his claims about Labour's voting record. Labour's shadow justice secretary David Lammy said the PM's ""idiotic jibe"" was a ""total disgrace"", and showed how little he cared about the issue. Earlier, Victims' Commissioner for England and Wales, Dame Vera Baird, told the Home Affairs Committee the government'slong-awaited rape reviewwas ""underwhelming"" but also a ""watershed moment"". She said there was a ""very large amount of kicking the can down the road"" but the apology made by ministers for falling prosecution rates was ""powerful"" and campaigners were seeing that as a ""signal of intent"". She said as long as the ""strength"" of that apology survived then she was hopeful ""we can really bring a change...and drive the government further"". But the treatment of victims was ""appalling"", she added, with police forces focusing on whether the victim was credible and not the defendant. Last week, Home Secretary Priti Patel said ministers were ""deeply ashamed"" of falling conviction rates and joined Mr Buckland in apologising for the situation and promising to ""do much better"". Asked in a BBC interview whether government cuts to the legal system were a factor, Mr Buckland said: ""Like all parts of public service big choices were made in the last decade, because of the position that we all faced economically and that's, I think, self-evidently the case."" He said the government was now ""seeking to make the necessary investment"" but also insisted ""it's about more than just money, it's about culture."" He argued that ""for too long"" rape allegations have focused on the credibility of the victim rather than the evidence.

Michael B Jordan to rename 'offensive' rum brandThe actor's J'Ouvert liquor sparked criticism from Nicki Minaj over its ties to Caribbean history.Entertainment & Arts,"Nicki Minaj asked Michael B Jordan to reconsider the use of J'Ouvert as a brand name due to its historic connotations Actor Michael B Jordan is to rename his rum drink brand amid allegations of Caribbean cultural appropriation. The Creed star's J'Ouvert liquor shares its name with a carnival which, while celebrating Caribbean culture, has ties to 19th Century slavery. In anInstagram post explaining the history,external, Trinidadian-born rapper Nicki Minaj urged Jordan to rethink its use. Jordan posted an apology and confirmed plans to change the name after ""a lot of listening"" to the community. ""I just wanna say on behalf of myself & my partners, our intention was never to offend or hurt a culture (we love & respect) and hoped to celebrate & shine a positive light on,"" he wrote in a statement on his Instagram story. What is cultural appropriation and why is it a problem? BBC Four - Lights Up, J'Ouvert ""We hear you. I hear you & want to be clear that we are in the process of renaming,"" he added of the drink, which launched earlier this month. The actor, who was born in California and played villain Erik Killmonger in Black Panther, has no links to the Caribbean. Lupita Nyong'o, Michael B Jordan, and the late Chadwick Boseman starred in Black Panther In her post addressing the controversy, Minaj clarified that she did not believe Jordan would ""intentionally do anything he thought Caribbean people would find offensive"".

The Creed star's J'Ouvert liquor shares its name with a carnival which, while celebrating Caribbean culture, has ties to 19th Century slavery. In anInstagram post explaining the history,external, Trinidadian-born rapper Nicki Minaj urged Jordan to rethink its use. Jordan posted an apology and confirmed plans to change the name after ""a lot of listening"" to the community.

LiveLiveVaccines minister to lead No 10 Covid briefing7 minutes ago,"Vaccine hesitancy has significantly dropped in the UK's Black and Asian communities, Vaccines Minister Nadhim Zahawi says He tells a Downing St briefing 82% of all adults in the UK have had a first vaccine dose and three in five have had both jabs Only a week after the programme opened to all adults on Friday, one third of 18-24-year-olds have had their first doses, he adds In January, the vast majority of hospital admissions were aged over 65 but now just a third are, Zahawi says This really does show the importance of getting the jab and, critically, getting the second dose, he says UK travel bosses call on the government to expand the green list and reopen international travel They say it is ""now or never"" to save what is left of the summer season - not just for holidaymakers but to protect jobs Meanwhile, scientists are trialling whether a drug called Ivermectin could help treat Covid symptoms Questions are being asked over whether Wembley should host the Euro 2020 final, amid concerns over Delta variant cases in the UK Edited by James Clarke, Rob Corp and Claire Heald Thanks for following our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic today. Updates were brought to you by Marie Jackson, Jennifer Meierhans, Victoria Lindrea, Alex Therrien, Richard Morris, Paul Kirby, James Clarke, Robert Corp and Claire Heald. Do join us again tomorrow when we will bring you the latest from the government's foreign travel review. The Queen referred to Health Secretary Matt Hancock as a ""poor man"" at a meeting with Boris Johnson. ""I've just been talking to your Secretary of State for Health, poor man. He came for Privy Council,"" she told the prime minister. ""He's full of..."", she added. ""Full of beans?"", offered Mr Johnson. Their weekly meetings are usually private but cameras were invited in to record the start of the first one to take place since lockdown began. Read more here. We are going to be wrapping up our live coverage of coronavirus soon so here's a recap on the day's news:  This video can not be played Covid vaccine: 'Your vaccine is an evergreen offer' Dr Nikki Kanani has encouraged everyone to come forward for their vaccine. Speaking at a Downing Street briefing she said:
""Your vaccine has a name on it, it is for you, and it is an evergreen offer"". Sir Elton wants to spend more time with his husband David Furnish and their two sons, Zachary and Elijah Sir Elton John's Farewell Yellow Brick Road tour has announced a further five stadium concerts in the UK in 2022. The 74-year-old star will perform in Norwich, Liverpool, Sunderland and Bristol, concluding in Swansea on 29 June 2022. The singer was forced to postpone a string of dates last year because of the pandemic. Tour dates announced for 2022 will also include a number of European cities, with performances scheduled in Paris, Frankfurt and Milan - before winding up the year with back-to-back performances at the Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles on 19 and 20 November. In January 2023, Sir Elton will travel to New Zealand for two shows, continuing on to Australia where the four-year tour will formally come to an end. ""The shows that I announce today will be my final tour dates ever in North America and Europe,"" says Sir Elton. ""I'm going to go out in the biggest possible way - performing at my very best, with the most spectacular production I've ever had, playing in places that have meant so much to me throughout my career."" UK Vaccines Minister Nadhim Zahawi has just finished giving a coronavirus briefing. Here's what we learned: Barnie Choudhury, from Eastern Eye newspaper, says by his calculations one in six people in Pakistani and Bangladeshi communities still haven't been vaccinated or got their second jab. He asks: ""Why is the government failing to meet these communities six months after the start of the programme?"" He says the panel had talked about visiting restaurants and mosques but asks: ""What else are you doing to reach those hard to reach communities - those vaccine deniers - to get a second jab?"" Nadzim Zahawi says the government has set up a ""connect and exchange hub"" to share best practice of what really works and work out how how to scale it. He says there was a vaccine pop-up in a Brent mosque and an event with Diane Abbot and the Haredi Hasidic Jewish community, which saw 364 members of the community coming forward to be vaccinated. ""It's incumbent on all of us to take what works and really scale it between now and 19 July"", he says. Helen CattPolitical correspondent As expected, the message from the vaccines minister was 'get the jab', particularly if it's your second dose. He delivered his message with a lot of numbers:  It's the sort of data that ministers will be pleased to see, particularly an increased take-up among some communities - which had been more hesitant about having the vaccine. But it suggests there is still some way to go before 19 July and the potential final lifting of restrictions on social contact. So there was another push to Asian communities and to the over-40s to get their second doses faster. Asad Ali from UK24 says many people in the Pakistani and Bangladeshi community are receiving false messages from unknown numbers on WhatsApp saying you could die from having the vaccination, or that the vaccine causes infertility. He asks what the government is doing to stop misleading information? Nadhim Zahawi says the vaccines are ""incredibly safe"" and are rated as such by the independent medicines regulatory body, which is not influenced by government. That sort of disinformation is incredibly harmful to the UK and globally, he states. He says the UK government has partnered with academic institutions to get the positive messaging of vaccination around the world. The next question comes from Channel 4. How worried is the minister and health chiefs about the Delta-plus variant? And there's a second part to the question about Covid travel passports. Nadhim Zahawi says viruses continue to mutate - but the good news is the vaccines are incredibly effective against the Delta variant. On Covid travel passports, he thinks a combination of proof of double-vaccination alongside testing is the way forward. On the subject ofthe new Delta-plus variant, Public Health England's Head of Immunisation Mary Ramsay says the UK has the "" best system in the world"" for picking up these cases, and reminds us they have only seen 41 cases of this variant in this country. ""We're on top of the situation,"" she says. Adina Campbell from BBC says people are less likely to have had a vaccine if they are black - is it time to take a new approach? She says the symptoms of the Delta variant are now recognised to include headache, runny nose and sore throat - she asks if the website should be updated to reflect this? Zahawi says since 1 April to date the additional uptake in white community is 3% but in Black and Black Afro-Caribbean communities it is 7% and in the Pakistani and Bangladeshi communities it has grown by 10%. He says this is due to the uptake strategy launched in February which includes community champions and extra resources for GP surgeries. On the Delta variant he says ""it's important we always update our information"" and urged people to get their jabs. This video can not be played Vaccines minister: 'Vaccine hesitancy has halved amongst black and black British people' Vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi says the UK's vaccination programme has passed another key milestone - with more than 60% of the adult population now fully vaccinated. Speaking at a Downing Street briefing he says: ""The vaccination programme has been delivered in the community, by the community and for the community"". Emily Morgan from ITV News says the government has been trying to persuade certain people from certain backgrounds to get the vaccine ""for months"". She asks at what point the government will accept that not everyone can be reached or accept the vaccine? Nadhim Zahawi says the government is straining every sinew to make sure that everyone has access to the vaccine. He says it is also about sharing data to ensure local health teams can see who has and hasn't been vaccinated. ""We've got to keep going, it's incumbent on all of us"" to keep getting people vaccinated, Zahawi says. He says he doesn't think he will ever stop encouraging people to get the vaccine. Alongside him, NHS England's vaccines boss Mary Ramsay says the government has to just keep going with encouragement. Andrew in Chichester asks why so many Covid vaccination centres are being closed when people still need to be vaccinated. Vaccines Minister Nadhim Zahawi says the deployment infrastructure can deliver many more vaccines and the record is 24 jabs a second. He says local systems are able to decide how we deploy and how we deliver vaccines, potentially focusing more on walk-in centres and mobile vaccination centres where needed. He says this means some vaccination sites are stood down so other areas with greater need can get vaccinations. Dr Nikki Kanani says vaccine centres are not closing, it is just that staff are busy working vaccinating people in other areas. We go to questions from the publicand Anna says that figures show most people going into hospital with Covid now have not been vaccinated. She asks if these are people who have chosen not to have jab or are they of an age where the rollout hasn't reached them yet? She also asks if they will hold back the freedoms of others already vaccinated? The vaccines minister says 60% of hospitalisations from the Delta variant are unvaccinated, but people are still coming forward for their jabs. Nadhim Zahawi says: ""We keep going at pace to make sure we protect the whole country because the virus will attempt to survive by finding people that are unprotected and then infecting them - particularly communities that are close knit."" He says he is ""confident"" that we will have 66% of the adult population with the protection of two jabs by 19 July. Dr Nikki Kanani, the medical director of Primary Care for NHS England is up next. She starts on a positive note, reiterating the figures of vaccine uptake which show the success of the vaccination programme - and thanks those working behind the scenes to deliver the programme, as well as those getting a vaccine. She says the vaccination programme continues in full swing, adding that while it is ""overwhelmingly positive"", ""we know some people are still anxious about coming forward for their vaccine"". Tackling vaccine hesitancy has been at the heart of our programme, she says. We continue to close the gap with more people from ethnic minorities coming forward and uptake is increasing faster in Black-African and Pakistani communities than in white backgrounds now, she adds. Between mid-March and mid-June uptake in Black and Asian communities rose - from 75% to 86% in Asian communities and 55% to 68% in Black communities. In his statement, the vaccines minister says the rollout has been delivered in places of worship across the whole of the UK. He says there have been open two-way conversations about the vaccines and how safe they are. He says this ""concerted community effort"" has really paid off. Vaccine hesitancy has halved among Black and Black British people since February. And it's halved in Asian and Asian British people in the same period, he says. But there is ""much more to do"" before we can take the final step on the road to recovery, he says. Mary Ramsay goes on to say that the number of people testing positive for Covid is increasing, but is not growing at the rate that happened during the second wave of the pandemic in England. She says hospitalisations and severe illnesses are being prevented by people being double vaccinated against Covid. Mary Ramsay, Head of Immunisation for NHS England, thanks those working across the NHS and Public Health England so that ""we can really inform ourselves"" on how best the UK can deal with the Delta variant. She says two doses of the vaccine has ""over 90%"" effectiveness against hospitalisation from the Delta variant of Covid-19. She reminds the public of the importance of other vaccines, not just the ones against Covid - for babies, school pupils and leavers and those aged over 70. Nadhim Zahawi says: ""Our mission is now to get as many people protected as we can and to protect them as quickly as we can."" The government made the ""difficult but essential decision"" to pause step four of the roadmap for four weeks with a review at two weeks, he says. (The move that meant a relaxation of England's coronavirus restrictions did not happen on Monday.) The time will be used to get jabs into the arms of those most vulnerable to Covid before restrictions are eased, he says. Two weeks ago, there were more than two million people in England over the age of 50 who had had a first dose but not a second. Now that number is 900,000, he says. Â© 2025 BBC.

"PM criticised for 'jabber' jibe in rape exchangesNo 10 insists Boris Johnson was accusing Labour of talking rather than taking action, at PMQs.UK PoliticsDanish fans expecting extra Euro 2020 ticketsThe Danish FA expects extra tickets for its match against Wales as Welsh fans are unable to attend.Wales","This video can not be played Keir Starmer says rape convictions and prosecutions are at a ârecord lowâ Labour is demanding an apology from Boris Johnson over a ""disgraceful"" remark in a clash with Sir Keir Starmer about a big fall in rape prosecutions. Questioned about the government's record, in his final answer at PMQs, Mr Johnson said: ""They jabber, we jab."" Labour's Jess Phillips said the remark showed he did not take tackling sexual violence against women seriously. No 10 insisted the PM was making a broader attack on Labour's tendency to talk about issues but not take action. At Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Johnson denied claims by Sir Keir Starmer that budget cuts were to blame for the fact that rape prosecutions in England and Wales have more than halved since 2016. Rape prosecutions debate fact-checked Ministers 'deeply ashamed' of rape conviction rates Sort rape convictions or go, Labour tells Buckland Why are rape prosecutions falling? He said it was down to ""evidential difficulties"" and a lack of ""joined-up"" working in the criminal justice system, rather than a lack of cash. This would appear to contradict his own justice secretary Robert Buckland, whotold the BBC last week cuts were ""self-evidently"" a factor, as he announced plans to fix the system. Sir Keir - who is the former head of the Crown Prosecution Service - said: ""On the prime minister's watch, rape prosecution and convictions are at a record low, court backlogs are at a record high, victims are waiting longer for justice and criminals are getting away with it. ""This wasn't inevitable, it's the cost of a decade of Conservative cuts and even now the government isn't showing the urgency and ambition that's needed."" He said that 98.6% of reported rapes did not end in charges or a sentence, which he called an ""appalling"" record. Mr Johnson apologised to rape survivors and victims ""for the trauma they have been through"" and the ""frustrations"" they feel at the ""inadequacies"" of the criminal justice system. He said the government was putting money into clearing court backlogs and a plan to improve rape conviction rates. And he accused Labour of not supporting tougher sentences for serious sexual and violent offenders. He ended the exchanges with an attack on Labour and praise for the government's coronavirus vaccination programme, saying: ""We are getting on with the job, they jabber, we jab."" This prompted an angry response from Labour's shadow minister for domestic violence and safeguarding, Jess Phillips. ""For the prime minister to describe questions about rape convictions as 'jabber' is disgraceful,"" said Ms Phillips. She called on the PM to apologise for his words, claiming he ""simply doesn't care about tackling sexual violence"". She later appeared in the Commons to make a point of order calling for the PM to apologise and ""correct the record"" over his claims about Labour's voting record. Labour's shadow justice secretary David Lammy said the PM's ""idiotic jibe"" was a ""total disgrace"", and showed how little he cared about the issue. Earlier, Victims' Commissioner for England and Wales, Dame Vera Baird, told the Home Affairs Committee the government'slong-awaited rape reviewwas ""underwhelming"" but also a ""watershed moment"". She said there was a ""very large amount of kicking the can down the road"" but the apology made by ministers for falling prosecution rates was ""powerful"" and campaigners were seeing that as a ""signal of intent"". She said as long as the ""strength"" of that apology survived then she was hopeful ""we can really bring a change...and drive the government further"". But the treatment of victims was ""appalling"", she added, with police forces focusing on whether the victim was credible and not the defendant. Last week, Home Secretary Priti Patel said ministers were ""deeply ashamed"" of falling conviction rates and joined Mr Buckland in apologising for the situation and promising to ""do much better"". Asked in a BBC interview whether government cuts to the legal system were a factor, Mr Buckland said: ""Like all parts of public service big choices were made in the last decade, because of the position that we all faced economically and that's, I think, self-evidently the case."" He said the government was now ""seeking to make the necessary investment"" but also insisted ""it's about more than just money, it's about culture."" He argued that ""for too long"" rape allegations have focused on the credibility of the victim rather than the evidence.

Leasehold campaigners welcome new changes,"Two big players in the leasehold sector have agreed to change the way they operate, following an investigation by the competition watchdog. Housebuilder Persimmon will allow its leaseholders to buy the freehold of their property at a discount. Insurance company Aviva, which buys leaseholds from house builders, will repay homeowners who saw their ground rents double. Campaigners for leaseholders said the commitments were a ""massive milestone"". The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) launched its investigation into leaseholds in 2019 because it was worried that leaseholders were facing huge and unexpected increases in the cost of buying a freehold or massive increases in ground rents. It said the said the commitments by Persimmon and Aviva were a ""real win"". CMA chief executive Andrea Coscelli said the watchdog now expected other housing developers and investors to take similar action. ""This is a real win for thousands of leaseholders - for too long people have found themselves trapped in homes they can struggle to sell or been faced with unexpectedly high prices to buy their freehold. ""But our work isn't done. We now expect other housing developers and investors to follow the lead of Aviva and Persimmon. If not, they can expect to face legal action."" With a leasehold, the person owns a lease which gives them the right to use the property. But they still have to get their landlord's permission for any work or changes to their homes. When a leasehold flat or house is first sold, a lease is granted for a fixed period of time, typically between 99 and 125 years, but sometimes up to 999 years - although people may extend their lease or buy the freehold. But leasehold house owners are often charged expensive ground rent as well as fees if they want to make changes to their homes. A leasehold house can also be difficult to sell. Under the new commitments Aviva will remove ground rent terms the CMA considers unfair and repay homeowners who saw rents doubled. In a statement Aviva said it had voluntarily agreed to amend a ""small proportion"" of leases it had acquired with terms which cause rents to double every 10 or 15 years. The agreement affected about 1,000 leases or just over 2% of those held by the fund. The CMA's George Lusty told the BBC: ""If Aviva is now the freeholder for your property and your lease contains a term that doubles the ground rent every ten or 15 years, that doubling won't apply, so you'll just pay the initial ground rent that you signed up to at the beginning and if you've already started to pay an increased fee, they'll refund that."" Jo Darbyshire, a co-founder of the National Leasehold Campaign, originally had a ground rent that doubled with developer Taylor Wimpey. She bought the house near Bolton in 2010 for Â£400,000 - and two years after that Taylor Wimpey sold the leasehold to Adriatic Land, now held by a division called Longharbour. ""The price to buy [the freehold] absolutely rocketed from Â£5,000 to Â£50,000 and it has since come down to Â£30,000."" Jo says she used Taylor Wimpey's ground rent assistance scheme which was Â£750 towards expenses and she didn't have to pay to have the lease converted from the one which had doubled to one that converts to rises linked to RPI inflation. She is now planning to speak to her solicitor to work out whether her best option is to try and buy the freehold at the original price or lower. ""It's good that Aviva has set this precedent, but whether or not [the firm that holds my] freehold will join them is another question,"" she adds. Taylor Wimpey said: ""We will continue to engage with the CMA and, as previously announced, we will work with them to find a satisfactory resolution."" Claire Stevens, from Lancaster, bought a Â£190,000 Persimmon property in 2017 and bought the freehold in 2019 for Â£3,750 - which 25 times the ground rent. She said she rang the helpline today to ask if she could expect a refund of Â£1,750 but they didn't know. ""We bought the freehold for house as soon as we could,"" she says. ""I hope that this is a genuine offer, not just a ploy to stop them being investigated further,"" Claire adds. Persimmon Homes has extended its existing Right to Buy scheme to cap the purchase price of a freehold at Â£2,000. It said the extended scheme applied to any leases sold on or after 1 January 2000 and would run until 31 December 2026. It said customers who had already acquired their freeholds from Persimmon under the existing Right to Buy scheme, and who still own the freehold, could apply to be reimbursed for the difference between the price paid and Â£2,000. Persimmon group chief executive Dean Finch said the agreement showed the company's ""determination to operate with integrity"". ""Building on our existing Right to Buy scheme, this agreement provides a fair deal for all leaseholders of Persimmon built houses, extending the opportunity to purchase their freehold at a price well below market value.""

Mr Lusty said both companies were required to keep the CMA informed about the changes they were making. ""We'll absolutely make sure that they stick to that and of course we're prepared to intervene again through court action in necessary to make sure they stick to what they've committed to do."" The National Leasehold Campaign, many of many of whose members gave evidence to the CMA, tweeted that the watchdog had secured ""landmark commitments for leaseholders. Another massive milestone. Persimmon & Aviva have eventually done the right thing at last, now other developers & freeholders MUST FOLLOW."" The CMA launched enforcement action against four housing developers in September 2020. In addition to Persimmon, these were Countryside Properties, Taylor Wimpey and Barrett. It has also been investigating investment firms Aviva, Abacus Land, Adriatic Land and Brigante Properties which bought leasehold contracts from Countryside and or Taylor Wimpey. Investigations are continuing into all of them except Persimmon and Aviva. The watchdog is taking a drip-drip approach in this long-running investigation. They are hoping that getting a few companies to agree to change their ways will pressure others to do the same without the need for costly court cases. It's not an easy task because there are now a lot of players in this market. The big developers began the trick of sneaking high ground rents into contracts, often without flagging it to buyers. But over time some of these lucrative contracts have been sold on to investment companies looking to profit from them. The pension firm Aviva owns just under 10% of those problematic contracts, with charges that double within 15 years. Their change of heart will certainly have a big impact on the 1,000 homeowners who have been paying the exorbitant bills, but it doesn't fix the problem for the other 12,000 households struggling to pay increasing ground rent on top of their mortgages. The government says it planning to ban ground rent from future contracts, but that won't help those who have an existing problem, unless the watchdog does more to force other builders and investment firms to change their contracts too. Mr Lusty said: ""We hope today's announcement will send a clear signal to other housing developers and investors that they need to sort out this really difficult issue for leasehold home owners."" The government, which asked the CMA to carry out the investigation, welcomed the agreement. Housing secretary Robert Jenrick said the settlement with Aviva and Persimmon was a ""hugely important step and demonstrates our commitment to support existing leaseholders who may have been mis-sold properties"". ""We have also introduced new legislation that will protect future homeowners by restricting ground rents in new leases to zero and I would strongly urge other developers to follow suit in amending their historic practices."" Mike Amesbury MP, Labour's shadow housing minister, said the change was welcome but ""further highlights the injustice faced by homeowners already trapped in our feudal leasehold system"". He said: ""The government has long promised reform, but their upcoming bill is a missed opportunity to help existing leaseholders...

Leasehold campaigners welcome new changesPersimmon and Aviva commit to change in light of competition watchdog inquiry into sector.Business,"Two big players in the leasehold sector have agreed to change the way they operate, following an investigation by the competition watchdog. Housebuilder Persimmon will allow its leaseholders to buy the freehold of their property at a discount. Insurance company Aviva, which buys leaseholds from house builders, will repay homeowners who saw their ground rents double. Campaigners for leaseholders said the commitments were a ""massive milestone"". The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) launched its investigation into leaseholds in 2019 because it was worried that leaseholders were facing huge and unexpected increases in the cost of buying a freehold or massive increases in ground rents. It said the said the commitments by Persimmon and Aviva were a ""real win"". CMA chief executive Andrea Coscelli said the watchdog now expected other housing developers and investors to take similar action. ""This is a real win for thousands of leaseholders - for too long people have found themselves trapped in homes they can struggle to sell or been faced with unexpectedly high prices to buy their freehold. ""But our work isn't done. We now expect other housing developers and investors to follow the lead of Aviva and Persimmon. If not, they can expect to face legal action."" With a leasehold, the person owns a lease which gives them the right to use the property. But they still have to get their landlord's permission for any work or changes to their homes. When a leasehold flat or house is first sold, a lease is granted for a fixed period of time, typically between 99 and 125 years, but sometimes up to 999 years - although people may extend their lease or buy the freehold. But leasehold house owners are often charged expensive ground rent as well as fees if they want to make changes to their homes. A leasehold house can also be difficult to sell. Under the new commitments Aviva will remove ground rent terms the CMA considers unfair and repay homeowners who saw rents doubled. In a statement Aviva said it had voluntarily agreed to amend a ""small proportion"" of leases it had acquired with terms which cause rents to double every 10 or 15 years. The agreement affected about 1,000 leases or just over 2% of those held by the fund. The CMA's George Lusty told the BBC: ""If Aviva is now the freeholder for your property and your lease contains a term that doubles the ground rent every ten or 15 years, that doubling won't apply, so you'll just pay the initial ground rent that you signed up to at the beginning and if you've already started to pay an increased fee, they'll refund that."" Jo Darbyshire, a co-founder of the National Leasehold Campaign, originally had a ground rent that doubled with developer Taylor Wimpey. She bought the house near Bolton in 2010 for Â£400,000 - and two years after that Taylor Wimpey sold the leasehold to Adriatic Land, now held by a division called Longharbour. ""The price to buy [the freehold] absolutely rocketed from Â£5,000 to Â£50,000 and it has since come down to Â£30,000."" Jo says she used Taylor Wimpey's ground rent assistance scheme which was Â£750 towards expenses and she didn't have to pay to have the lease converted from the one which had doubled to one that converts to rises linked to RPI inflation. She is now planning to speak to her solicitor to work out whether her best option is to try and buy the freehold at the original price or lower. ""It's good that Aviva has set this precedent, but whether or not [the firm that holds my] freehold will join them is another question,"" she adds. Taylor Wimpey said: ""We will continue to engage with the CMA and, as previously announced, we will work with them to find a satisfactory resolution."" Claire Stevens, from Lancaster, bought a Â£190,000 Persimmon property in 2017 and bought the freehold in 2019 for Â£3,750 - which 25 times the ground rent. She said she rang the helpline today to ask if she could expect a refund of Â£1,750 but they didn't know. ""We bought the freehold for house as soon as we could,"" she says. ""I hope that this is a genuine offer, not just a ploy to stop them being investigated further,"" Claire adds. Persimmon Homes has extended its existing Right to Buy scheme to cap the purchase price of a freehold at Â£2,000. It said the extended scheme applied to any leases sold on or after 1 January 2000 and would run until 31 December 2026. It said customers who had already acquired their freeholds from Persimmon under the existing Right to Buy scheme, and who still own the freehold, could apply to be reimbursed for the difference between the price paid and Â£2,000. Persimmon group chief executive Dean Finch said the agreement showed the company's ""determination to operate with integrity"". ""Building on our existing Right to Buy scheme, this agreement provides a fair deal for all leaseholders of Persimmon built houses, extending the opportunity to purchase their freehold at a price well below market value.""

Mr Lusty said both companies were required to keep the CMA informed about the changes they were making. ""We'll absolutely make sure that they stick to that and of course we're prepared to intervene again through court action in necessary to make sure they stick to what they've committed to do."" The National Leasehold Campaign, many of many of whose members gave evidence to the CMA, tweeted that the watchdog had secured ""landmark commitments for leaseholders. Another massive milestone. Persimmon & Aviva have eventually done the right thing at last, now other developers & freeholders MUST FOLLOW."" The CMA launched enforcement action against four housing developers in September 2020. In addition to Persimmon, these were Countryside Properties, Taylor Wimpey and Barrett. It has also been investigating investment firms Aviva, Abacus Land, Adriatic Land and Brigante Properties which bought leasehold contracts from Countryside and or Taylor Wimpey. Investigations are continuing into all of them except Persimmon and Aviva. The watchdog is taking a drip-drip approach in this long-running investigation. They are hoping that getting a few companies to agree to change their ways will pressure others to do the same without the need for costly court cases. It's not an easy task because there are now a lot of players in this market. The big developers began the trick of sneaking high ground rents into contracts, often without flagging it to buyers. But over time some of these lucrative contracts have been sold on to investment companies looking to profit from them. The pension firm Aviva owns just under 10% of those problematic contracts, with charges that double within 15 years. Their change of heart will certainly have a big impact on the 1,000 homeowners who have been paying the exorbitant bills, but it doesn't fix the problem for the other 12,000 households struggling to pay increasing ground rent on top of their mortgages. The government says it planning to ban ground rent from future contracts, but that won't help those who have an existing problem, unless the watchdog does more to force other builders and investment firms to change their contracts too. Mr Lusty said: ""We hope today's announcement will send a clear signal to other housing developers and investors that they need to sort out this really difficult issue for leasehold home owners."" The government, which asked the CMA to carry out the investigation, welcomed the agreement. Housing secretary Robert Jenrick said the settlement with Aviva and Persimmon was a ""hugely important step and demonstrates our commitment to support existing leaseholders who may have been mis-sold properties"". ""We have also introduced new legislation that will protect future homeowners by restricting ground rents in new leases to zero and I would strongly urge other developers to follow suit in amending their historic practices."" Mike Amesbury MP, Labour's shadow housing minister, said the change was welcome but ""further highlights the injustice faced by homeowners already trapped in our feudal leasehold system"". He said: ""The government has long promised reform, but their upcoming bill is a missed opportunity to help existing leaseholders... The Government must go further and faster to help existing leaseholders.""

EU citizens given 28-day deadline to apply to stay,"Immigration enforcement officials will begin giving EU citizens who live in the UK a 28-day warning to apply to remain, the government says. But the Home Office will allow people indefinite time to complete an application for settled status if they have a reasonable excuse for delay. There is a week to go until the deadline for applications. Some 5.6 millionEuropean Economic Area,external(EEA) citizens and their dependents have applied for settled status. But there are around 400,000 cases outstanding, and the government's helpline is receiving thousands of calls a day. How many more EU nationals are in UK than was thought? Digital border will allow arrivals to be measured Letter sent to Home Office over immigration policy After the 2016 Brexit referendum, which took place precisely five years ago, settled status was introduced for citizens of the EU and EEA living in the UK. It allows them to retain the same rights of residence, travel, employment and access to healthcare and benefits. The countries whose nationals have made the highest numbers of applications are Poland (975,000) and Romania (918,000). Immigration minister Kevin Foster said anyone whose application was not concluded by next week's deadline would not lose out, as their rights were protected in law. He added that immigration enforcement officials would begin issuing 28-day notices to people, advising them to apply for settled status. Migrants' groups had voiced concern that children would be among those who had not applied. But Mr Foster said there would be an indefinite period where people who had not applied would be allowed to do so, if they had reasonable grounds. He gave the example of students who might discover when applying to university for the first time that they do not have settled status. Asked whether the new immigration system had made it difficult to attract EU workers, he said that ""in the first instance"" employers should be looking to recruit from the UK market. ""We're giving people access on a global basis to skills that take time to train, but for jobs that take less time to train for, we do believe it's right we encourage employers to look in the first instance to offer rewarding and good packages to domestic workers,"" he told the BBC. EU nationals living in the UK have until 30 June to apply to stay in the UK. They can apply for: Settled status - on offer to anyone who can prove that they had been in the UK continuously for five years or more before 31 December 2020. As of 31 May, it has been granted to 2.75 million people. Pre-settled status - on offer to anyone who had been in the UK for less than five years by the end of 2020. As of 31 May, it has been granted to 2.28 million. They can apply for settled status in future, but there is no guarantee they will get it. Maike Bohn, co-founder of the EU citizens' campaign group the3million, said: ""It's good that people can apply late, but the crux is they're unlawful as they haven't put an application in. ""Those eligible and not applying on time become unlawful and risk losing work, housing, access to free health care and so much more."" Mr Foster said existing benefit claimants would not have their payments stopped immediately if they had not been granted settled status. But he said no-one could begin a benefit claim, job, or tenancy in England without settled status. He also said the Home Office had ""changed guidance"" to border officials after reports that some EU citizens had been detained for long periods at the border last month. Speaking to the House of Lords European Affairs Committee on Tuesday, he said: ""I want to get as many people through the door before the 30th [of June] as possible."" The EEA is made up of the 27 EU states plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. No-one knows how many EU citizens living in the UK have yet to apply for settled status, allowing them to remain here legally after next week's deadline. The European Union suspects there could be tens of thousands of people, many of them vulnerable, who will not have submitted their application in time. Older people and children in care are of particular concern, and the EU is urging the Home Office to guarantee the rights of late applicants. The UK government says it will take a ""compassionate and flexible"" approach, giving people who have 'reasonable grounds' for missing the deadline, 28 days to apply. No action will be taken against them once an application has been submitted. The EU, however, says Britain's compliant or hostile environment towards migrants gives them cause for concern.

Lloyds to close another 44 bank branches,"Lloyds Banking Group is to close another 44 branches, blaming a lack of customers at the sites as people move to digital banking. The move comes in addition to previous announcements and means a total of 100 branches will close this year. Lloyds and Halifax branded branches in England and Wales are included in the latest closure programme. The Unite union condemned the move, saying the bank was ""walking away from local communities"". ""The decision to further erode its presence within our communities is baffling,"" said Unite national officer Caren Evans. ""The closure of 44 more bank branches will deny our communities of essential services such as access to cash and experienced highly trained staff. A local ATM is not a suitable alternative to a staffed bank branch."" New Lloyds boss may land Â£5.5m pay day John Lewis and Lloyds Bank in new job cuts The bank said a third of the branches which were closing were located in large towns and cities, with another branch nearby. Its retail director, Vim Maru, said there had been considerably fewer transactions at these branches in the last five years. ""Like many businesses on the high street, we must change for a future where branches will be used in a different way, and visited less often,"" he said. The branches will close between September and November, with 29 Lloyds Bank and 15 Halifax branches to go. The locations of the Lloyds branches are: Bournemouth Westbourne, Cardiff Rumney, Leeds Horsforth, Northwood, Stony Stratford, Church Village, Morley, London Regent Street, Oakham, Brixham, Quinton, Mildenhall, Berkeley Square, Faversham, Brighton Preston Circus, Gants Hill, Halstead, Holsworthy, Henley-on-Thames, Hendon, Kempston, Towcester, Kentish Town, Tadley, Bromborough, Cheltenham Bath Road, Haslemere, Newport Maindee, and Sedgley Dudley. The Halifax branches to shut are: Manchester Cross Street, Plaistow West Ham, Chesham, Chertsey, Fleet, Harpenden, Potters Bar, Kenilworth, Hinckley, Market Harborough, Upminster, Rugeley, Cheshunt, Pinner, and Chesterfield Central Pavement. Following the closures, the group will have 779 Lloyds Bank branches, 560 Halifax branches, and 184 Bank of Scotland branches. New bank hubs, like this one in Essex, are being trialled where branches have disappeared Hundreds of branches across the UK's banking network have been closing. The trend may be accelerated by Covid, as some people were forced to bank digitally for the first time during lockdown. This has added to the debate about the future of bank branches and cash. A series of trials are taking place, designed to find ways of ensuring consumers and businesses have access to cash, and speedy deposit options, when branches are closing. They have includedshared bank hubs, run by the Post Office, which also have staff from each of the major High Street banks visiting once a week. Martin McTague, from the Federation of Small Businesses, said the latest bank closure announcements had created ""a wave of disappointment"" across communities. ""Bank branches are not only critical to those who still depend on cash - often society's most vulnerable, they also serve as a draw for shoppers, meaning footfall for surrounding small businesses,"" he said. He called on the government, Bank of England, High Street lenders, independent ATM providers, regulators and the Post Office to ensure the infrastructure was in place to allow businesses to climb out of the Covid-created economic slowdown.

Lego plans to make bricks from recycled bottles,"The next stage is to add colours to the bricks and then do some market-testing with children. Toy giant Lego is aiming to put bricks made from recycled drinks bottles on shelves within two years. Lego makes about 3,500 different bricks and shapes, but faces the challenge of coming up with a sustainable product that can last years - decades, even. The goal is to find a product good enough that people don't notice the difference, said Lego's Tim Brooks. He did not specify how many of its bricks will contain recycled material, adding: ""It's too soon to say."" But he added that Lego wants to start using the bottle-made ones ""as soon as possible"". Mr Brooks, Lego's vice president of sustainability, said the two types of blocks should fit together and be interchangeable like any Lego product. Lego is investing heavily to build the brand in China The next stage will be to add colours to the prototype bricks, and test them with children and adult fans,. Lego said it would initially get soft drinks bottles from the US to make its new plastic toy parts. It said plastic recovered from the oceans would not be suitable as it is typically too degraded. Libby Peake, head of resource policy at the thinktank, Green Alliance said the recycled plastic plan is ""certainly preferable to using virgin plastic"" but she ""hopes the supply of single use plastic bottles falls in future as people embrace reuse"". A number of firms are making products from recycled plastic as sustainability becomes more important to customers. Lego said that many customers, both children and adult, were asking for more sustainability when buying products in general, and had contacted the firm to say so. But Friends of the Earth plastics campaigner Camilla Zerr said that ""it's really important that recycling isn't hailed as the default solution to the plastics crisis."" ""Manufacturers must ensure toys are made to endure many years of use, so they can be handed down and reused from generation to generation,"" she adds. Lego to ditch plastic bags after children call for change In 2018, Lego set a goal to make all of its core products from sustainable materials by 2030. As part of these efforts, Mr Brooks said the company had developed prototype bricks made from polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles, with some other chemicals added. At present, the company makes many of its bricks using acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), a virgin plastic made from crude oil. Using PET will also allow the firm to make different shaped Lego pieces. Typically, Lego is durable enough to last for two to three generations of humans playing with it, and that is what the firm is aiming for with its PET blocks, Mr Brooks said. In trying to make its products more sustainable, Lego decided to carry on making them durable, rather than biodegradable, and is banking on people saving the blocks and not throwing them away, he said. The biggest challenge with the new blocks is getting the ""clutch"" right, he said. That is, children being able to stick them together and pull them apart with their fingers, regardless of the ambient temperature. Some materials they tested couldn't even be prised apart with pliers, he said. The firm has a temperature test, a butter test, and a test to mimic children putting them in their mouths. ""Cleaning it up and getting it to turn into Hogwarts Castle is a challenge,"" he said, referring to Harry Potter merchandise. ""A super-fun challenge."" Lego makes between 110 and 120 billion plastic pieces per year, and about 80% are currently made from ABS. About 5% are made from a polymer that comes from sugar cane from which Lego makes its plastic plants. The firm emits about 1.2 million tonnes of carbon per year, and about a third of that is from making its materials. Using recycled plastic will help to cut those emissions, and the firm also wants to use more renewable energy in its processes, Mr Brooks said.

Young elephant dies in zoo attack,"M'Changa ""will be missed dearly by all staff as well as our members and visitors"", the zoo's managing director said Keepers are ""distraught"" after a young elephant died in an attack involving another bull elephant, a zoo has said. The 12-year-old African elephant, M'Changa, was fatally injured at Noah's Ark Zoo Farm, in Wraxall, near Bristol, where he lived in an enclosure with two other bull elephants. One of the elephants attacked M'Changa where he had been sleeping in the early hours on Friday, the zoo said. A full investigation and a review into what happened is under way. The other two bull elephants, named Shaka and Janu, were part of the same ""male bachelor group"" that had ""successfully lived together for over three years"", and were unharmed, the zoo said. In a statement, the zoo added: ""Bull elephants are large and powerful animals. Their behaviour in the wild and in zoos can often typically be active, boisterous and can at times be aggressive. ""M'Changa, Shaka and Janu enjoyed special bonds as part of the group, often displaying brotherly relationships. ""Our dedicated team of Elephant keepers are understandably distraught over this recent event, and we are doing all that we can to support them during this difficult time."" Larry Bush, the zoo's managing director, said: ""M'Changa's loss will be felt very deeply,"" adding: "" We will continue to help promote and contribute to the conservation of elephants into the future."" African Elephants are classed as endangered in the wild, where they are threatened by poaching for their ivory, as well as habitat loss and human population expansion. After planning permission was granted for the 20-acre (8-hectare) ""Elephant Eden"" at the zoo in 2010, a number of animal welfare groups, including the RSPCA and Born Free Foundation, expressed concerns about the elephants being kept in the zoo's captivity. At the time,the zoo responded to the claims and saidthe enclosure was designed ""to offer welfare improvements to elephants already living in captivity"". The zoo's statement following the death of M'Changa, who arrived in 2014 from Sweden, added: ""The facility, Elephant Eden, has been previously commended on its best practice with specialist elephant keepers, 20 acres of space to roam and extensive efforts made for enrichment and sustaining healthy, active elephants. ""They are typically social animals, so having the option of being together is an important part of elephant welfare."" The Zoo said it would look at its future plans to establish the best way forward for its elephant programme. A spokesman at the British and Irish Association of Zoos and Aquariums (BIAZA) said it was saddened to hear of M'Changa's death. ""The bachelor elephant group at Noah's Ark plays a key supporting role serving wider African Elephant conservation efforts, as an important part of the European Endangered Species Programme,"" he said.

Royal Academy apologises to artist Jess de Wahls,"Jess de Wahls creates hand-sewn portraits from recycled clothes The Royal Academy of Arts has apologised to artist Jess de Wahls after removing her work from its gift shop following complaints that she had expressed transphobic views. Her embroidery was removed after a backlash over comments she made in 2019 saying ""humans can not change sex"". De Wahls, who denies transphobia, said she ""appreciates"" the apology. ""We had no right to judge her views,"" the prestigious London institution said ina statement,externalon Wednesday. ""There has been a great deal of debate around the RA's recent communication about no longer stocking the work of Jess de Wahls in the Royal Academy shop,"" it said. ""We have thought long and hard since then about this and the wider issues it raises. ""One thing is clear to us now - we should have handled this better. We have apologised to Jess de Wahls for the way we have treated her and do so again publicly now. We had no right to judge her views on our social media. This betrayed our most important core value - the protection of free speech."" The Royal Academy re-opened last month after some Covid-19 restrictions were lifted The Royal Academy blamed ""a failure of communications internally"" for de Wahls first hearing via social media that her work was being dropped, and promised to ""now reopen discussions with her"" about restocking it. De Wahls said the apology was ""common sense and I am glad we are getting back to that"", adding: ""I hope this makes other institutions wake up and take note."" Jess de Wahls asks for apology from Royal Academy What does transgender mean and what does the law say? The German-born textiles artist wrote in a blog in 2019 that ""a woman is an adult human female. (Not an identity or feeling.)"" She told BBC Radio 4 on Monday she had received lots of support in the light of the Royal Academy's original decision to remove her work. ""The feedback I'm getting from the general public is quite the opposite [from the Royal Academy's stance]. This isn't going to go away. This is a conversation that needs to happen in public.""

Cuts not to blame for rape failures - Johnson,"This video can not be played Keir Starmer says rape convictions and prosecutions are at a ârecord lowâ Labour is demanding an apology from Boris Johnson over a ""disgraceful"" remark in a clash with Sir Keir Starmer about a big fall in rape prosecutions. Questioned about the government's record, in his final answer at PMQs, Mr Johnson said: ""They jabber, we jab."" Labour's Jess Phillips said the remark showed he did not take tackling sexual violence against women seriously. No 10 insisted the PM was making a broader attack on Labour's tendency to talk about issues but not take action. At Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Johnson denied claims by Sir Keir Starmer that budget cuts were to blame for the fact that rape prosecutions in England and Wales have more than halved since 2016. Rape prosecutions debate fact-checked Ministers 'deeply ashamed' of rape conviction rates Sort rape convictions or go, Labour tells Buckland Why are rape prosecutions falling? He said it was down to ""evidential difficulties"" and a lack of ""joined-up"" working in the criminal justice system, rather than a lack of cash. This would appear to contradict his own justice secretary Robert Buckland, whotold the BBC last week cuts were ""self-evidently"" a factor, as he announced plans to fix the system. Sir Keir - who is the former head of the Crown Prosecution Service - said: ""On the prime minister's watch, rape prosecution and convictions are at a record low, court backlogs are at a record high, victims are waiting longer for justice and criminals are getting away with it. ""This wasn't inevitable, it's the cost of a decade of Conservative cuts and even now the government isn't showing the urgency and ambition that's needed."" He said that 98.6% of reported rapes did not end in charges or a sentence, which he called an ""appalling"" record. Mr Johnson apologised to rape survivors and victims ""for the trauma they have been through"" and the ""frustrations"" they feel at the ""inadequacies"" of the criminal justice system. He said the government was putting money into clearing court backlogs and a plan to improve rape conviction rates. And he accused Labour of not supporting tougher sentences for serious sexual and violent offenders. He ended the exchanges with an attack on Labour and praise for the government's coronavirus vaccination programme, saying: ""We are getting on with the job, they jabber, we jab."" This prompted an angry response from Labour's shadow minister for domestic violence and safeguarding, Jess Phillips. ""For the prime minister to describe questions about rape convictions as 'jabber' is disgraceful,"" said Ms Phillips. She called on the PM to apologise for his words, claiming he ""simply doesn't care about tackling sexual violence"". She later appeared in the Commons to make a point of order calling for the PM to apologise and ""correct the record"" over his claims about Labour's voting record. Labour's shadow justice secretary David Lammy said the PM's ""idiotic jibe"" was a ""total disgrace"", and showed how little he cared about the issue. Earlier, Victims' Commissioner for England and Wales, Dame Vera Baird, told the Home Affairs Committee the government'slong-awaited rape reviewwas ""underwhelming"" but also a ""watershed moment"". She said there was a ""very large amount of kicking the can down the road"" but the apology made by ministers for falling prosecution rates was ""powerful"" and campaigners were seeing that as a ""signal of intent"". She said as long as the ""strength"" of that apology survived then she was hopeful ""we can really bring a change...and drive the government further"". But the treatment of victims was ""appalling"", she added, with police forces focusing on whether the victim was credible and not the defendant. Last week, Home Secretary Priti Patel said ministers were ""deeply ashamed"" of falling conviction rates and joined Mr Buckland in apologising for the situation and promising to ""do much better"". Asked in a BBC interview whether government cuts to the legal system were a factor, Mr Buckland said: ""Like all parts of public service big choices were made in the last decade, because of the position that we all faced economically and that's, I think, self-evidently the case."" He said the government was now ""seeking to make the necessary investment"" but also insisted ""it's about more than just money, it's about culture."" He argued that ""for too long"" rape allegations have focused on the credibility of the victim rather than the evidence.

Questions, Boris Johnson said the government had invested âanother Â£85mâ in the
Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) to help improve the record on rape
prosecutions. Thatâs true, but it comes off the back of budget cuts of 25% to
the Ministry of Justice, including the CPS, since 2010-11. CPS staff numbers fell by
2,374 between 2010-11 and 2019-20. In the year to the end of
March 2020, 58,856 cases of rape were recorded by police forces in England and
Wales. In the same year (although
this will not necessarily be the same cases due to the time it takes for them
to move through the criminal justice system) there were just 2,102
prosecutions, compared with 4,536 in 2014-15 â more than halving. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Here's a quick round up of what was said at today's question time: Reality Check Boris Johnson has been talking about the EU Settlement
Scheme that allows EU nationals living in the UK to maintain their rights after
Brexit. âIt has produced 5.6 million applications already and I seem
to remember that we were told there were only 3.2 million or 3 million to begin
with,â he said. He switched between referring to 5.6 million applications
and 5.6 million people. Itâs not the same thing as there are some duplicates. But there have been five million successful applications, which is considerably
more than the estimate for the number of EU nationals living in the UK. The Office for National Statistics is working on new methods
to come up with bettermigration statistics,external. You can read more about ithere. Conservative Theresa Villiers also raises the issue of planning and asks if the PM will reassure residents that they will have a say over what is built in their neighbourhood. The PM says ""yes indeed"". He says he won't have the new Planning Bill ""misrepresented by anybody""  because ministers want to give people the chance of home ownership. He says he wants to ""relieve pressure on the over-heating south east"" and ""build back better across the whole of the UK"". Also by video link, Labour MP Bell Ribeiro-Addy says that scientists have warned that variants of coronavirus could reduce the effectiveness of vaccines. She says that intellectual property laws are slowing down the roll-out of the vaccine globally. Boris Johnson says the G7 have agreed to another billion vaccines on top of the billion already promised. He says vaccines are effective against all variants that ""we can currently see"". Conservative Esther McVey asks the prime minister if the HS2 project will soon no longer become ""value for money"" or whether he will see it through despite the high cost. She says it is a ""white elephant"" and the money would be better spent on delivering high-speed broadband. Boris Johnson says broadband coverage is important, but says he does not agree with her on HS2. Labour MP Janet Daby says yesterday was Windrush Day, ""yet this year it's a reminder of the appalling failure"" of the Windrush Compensation Scheme. She says at least 21 people have died while awaiting payments, and only 687 people have received any compensation at all. Boris Johnson says he accepts ""the injustice that was done to the Windrush Generation"" and he wants to make sure that payments from the scheme are ""accelerated"". He says in the future he wants Windrush to be associated a positive message, of those who came to the UK to work and help the country. Conservative Andrew Mitchell asks about the announcement from the foreign office that Britain is to cut its support for tackling neglected tropical diseases by 95%. He says this means tablets and vaccines will be destroyed as a result so has the PM had a chance to review the decision he asks and will he have a vote in the Commons on cuts to aid spending? Boris Johnson says there will be a debate on overseas aid but he does not accept this view of the country's contribution to the fight of disease around the world. The UK is contributing Â£10bn this year the PM says, in spite of the ""colossal spending"" the government has been forced to make to look after families and support jobs in this country during the pandemic. The SNP's Owen Thompson accuses the government of wanting to ""neuter"" the Electoral Commission, the watchdog that oversees political financing in the UK. It comes after ministers last week announced plans to specify in law that the watchdog should not be able to bring prosecutions - a power it has previously asked for. But Boris Johnson doesn't engage, adding: ""I can say absolutely nothing"". SNP MP Philippa Whitford says that during the Brexit referendum the PM promised there'd be no rights changes for EU citizens in the UK. She says those without settled status in one week won't be able to rent property or access healthcare. She says the UK asked repeatedly for grace periods during Brexit transitions, so she asks why this can't be extended to EU citizens. Boris Johnson says the settled status scheme has been a ""great success"" and has received 5.6m applications so far. He urges any otherEU citizens who want to remain in the UKto fill out the relevant forms in the next week. Joining by video link Labour's Julie Elliott calls on the PM to condemn internet giant Amazon for ""throwing brand new tech into landfill"" - following reports it has destroyed unsold computers. She says this is ""appalling"" and is denying internet to poor children to learn remotely during the pandemic. Boris Johnson says he was ""shocked"" to hear computers were being thrown away, calling it ""bizarre and unacceptable"". He says he is sure the company ""will wish to rectify it as fast as possible"". Conservative Steve Double raises the issue of planning for new homes. He says there is a housing crisis in Cornwall with local people being priced out of the market by inflated prices due to the huge demand for  second homes. Will the  PM ensure planning reforms are not about helping the wealthy but rather to enable locals to get the homes they need, he asks. Johnson says the point has been raised repeatedly with him and he is ""determined"" to address the issue. He says the focus will be on building ""local homes for local people"". Off the back his party'sshock by-election win. Lib Dem Leader Sir Ed Davey says that people in Chesham and Amersham told him how they were worried about holding down a job and caring for family members as a family carer. He says there are ""thousands of people"" like this in every constituency in ""Conservative heartlands"". He asks what the PM will do ""to make these people's lives a little easier"" for those caring for others, unpaid. Boris Johnson says he ""salutes"" family carers. He says the government has looked after these families ""to the best of this country's ability"" and is putting ""unprecedented funds"" into adult social care. SNP Westminster leader, Ian Blackford is up. He asks if the government used an emergency Covid contract, as reported in the Herald newspaper,  to conduct constitutional  campaigning on the union. Mr Johnson says he is not aware of this. But Blackford says during the height of the pandemic emergency contracts were used to conduct political research and will the PM commit to an inquiry? Johnson says he can't think of a better use of public funds than making sure all of the UK fights the pandemic together. For his final question, Keir Starmer says ""criminals are ""getting away with it"" because of ""record low"" rape conviction rates, and ""record high"" backlogs in the court system. Blaming it on a ""decade of Conservative cuts,"" he asks the PM to take ""some responsibility"" and apologise to rape victims. In reply, Boris Johnson says ""of course I say sorry for the trauma they have been through"" due to the ""inadequacies"" of the justice system, which he vows ministers will improve. He says the government is focusing on recovering from the pandemic - goading Labour with the charge that ""they jabber, we jab"". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer says he spent ""five years as Director of Public Prosecutions"" and so he knows the ""impact of cuts"". He says the government can't make cuts to the Crown Prosecution Service and close ""half of courts in England and Wales"" and think that a modest increase in funding will fix problems. He says the government's so-called rape review is ""unambitious"" and does nothing to address the ""epidemic of violence against women and girls"". Boris Johnson says the government has brought in the ""landmark"" violence against women and girls legislation. He says Labour voted against increasing sentences for serious sexual offences. Starmer says the PM's response is ""appalling"". We have ""terrible"" rates of conviction and prosecution for rape he says and victims are being failed so does the PM accept that cuts to the criminal justice system have contributed to this? The PM says ""no"" that is not the case. He says funding has increased and rather it is a lack of joined up thinking in the system that is to blame. He says police numbers are up and more investment is going in. Keir Starmer says Labour declined to support the government's sentencing bill because it did ""more to protect statues than women"". He asks what section of the bill ""will do anything"" to increase the number of reported rapes that result in a charge being brought. He says this is currently not the case in 98.4% of reported rapes. The prime minister points to a section of the bill to get rid of the early release people who have already been convicted of rape at the halfway point in their sentence. He says the government is also investing to ensure there are advisers so that rape victims and survivors ""have people in whom they can confide and trust"". Â© 2025 BBC.

Lego aims to make bricks from recycled bottlesFirm says challenge is to make more environmentally friendly bricks strong enough to build Hogwarts.Business,"The next stage is to add colours to the bricks and then do some market-testing with children. Toy giant Lego is aiming to put bricks made from recycled drinks bottles on shelves within two years. Lego makes about 3,500 different bricks and shapes, but faces the challenge of coming up with a sustainable product that can last years - decades, even. The goal is to find a product good enough that people don't notice the difference, said Lego's Tim Brooks. He did not specify how many of its bricks will contain recycled material, adding: ""It's too soon to say."" But he added that Lego wants to start using the bottle-made ones ""as soon as possible"". Mr Brooks, Lego's vice president of sustainability, said the two types of blocks should fit together and be interchangeable like any Lego product. Lego is investing heavily to build the brand in China The next stage will be to add colours to the prototype bricks, and test them with children and adult fans,. Lego said it would initially get soft drinks bottles from the US to make its new plastic toy parts. It said plastic recovered from the oceans would not be suitable as it is typically too degraded. Libby Peake, head of resource policy at the thinktank, Green Alliance said the recycled plastic plan is ""certainly preferable to using virgin plastic"" but she ""hopes the supply of single use plastic bottles falls in future as people embrace reuse"". A number of firms are making products from recycled plastic as sustainability becomes more important to customers. Lego said that many customers, both children and adult, were asking for more sustainability when buying products in general, and had contacted the firm to say so. But Friends of the Earth plastics campaigner Camilla Zerr said that ""it's really important that recycling isn't hailed as the default solution to the plastics crisis."" ""Manufacturers must ensure toys are made to endure many years of use, so they can be handed down and reused from generation to generation,"" she adds. Lego to ditch plastic bags after children call for change In 2018, Lego set a goal to make all of its core products from sustainable materials by 2030. As part of these efforts, Mr Brooks said the company had developed prototype bricks made from polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles, with some other chemicals added. At present, the company makes many of its bricks using acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), a virgin plastic made from crude oil. Using PET will also allow the firm to make different shaped Lego pieces. Typically, Lego is durable enough to last for two to three generations of humans playing with it, and that is what the firm is aiming for with its PET blocks, Mr Brooks said. In trying to make its products more sustainable, Lego decided to carry on making them durable, rather than biodegradable, and is banking on people saving the blocks and not throwing them away, he said. The biggest challenge with the new blocks is getting the ""clutch"" right, he said. That is, children being able to stick them together and pull them apart with their fingers, regardless of the ambient temperature. Some materials they tested couldn't even be prised apart with pliers, he said. The firm has a temperature test, a butter test, and a test to mimic children putting them in their mouths. ""Cleaning it up and getting it to turn into Hogwarts Castle is a challenge,"" he said, referring to Harry Potter merchandise. ""A super-fun challenge."" Lego makes between 110 and 120 billion plastic pieces per year, and about 80% are currently made from ABS. About 5% are made from a polymer that comes from sugar cane from which Lego makes its plastic plants. The firm emits about 1.2 million tonnes of carbon per year, and about a third of that is from making its materials. Using recycled plastic will help to cut those emissions, and the firm also wants to use more renewable energy in its processes, Mr Brooks said.

Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer says he spent ""five years as Director of Public Prosecutions"" and so he knows the ""impact of cuts"". He says the government can't make cuts to the Crown Prosecution Service and close ""half of courts in England and Wales"" and think that a modest increase in funding will fix problems. He says the government's so-called rape review is ""unambitious"" and does nothing to address the ""epidemic of violence against women and girls"". Boris Johnson says the government has brought in the ""landmark"" violence against women and girls legislation. He says Labour voted against increasing sentences for serious sexual offences. Starmer says the PM's response is ""appalling"". We have ""terrible"" rates of conviction and prosecution for rape he says and victims are being failed so does the PM accept that cuts to the criminal justice system have contributed to this? The PM says ""no"" that is not the case. He says funding has increased and rather it is a lack of joined up thinking in the system that is to blame. He says police numbers are up and more investment is going in. Keir Starmer says Labour declined to support the government's sentencing bill because it did ""more to protect statues than women"". He asks what section of the bill ""will do anything"" to increase the number of reported rapes that result in a charge being brought. He says this is currently not the case in 98.4% of reported rapes. The prime minister points to a section of the bill to get rid of the early release people who have already been convicted of rape at the halfway point in their sentence. He says the government is also investing to ensure there are advisers so that rape victims and survivors ""have people in whom they can confide and trust"". Â© 2025 BBC.

LiveLiveBoris Johnson faces prime minister's questionsLess than a minute ago,"Boris Johnson and Keir Starmer clashed over conviction rates for rape and sexual assault The Labour leader asked the PM why conviction rate for rape are falling Boris Johnson says ""too often"" cases are not fit for prosecution and blamed a lack of joined-up thinking in the system UK travel bosses are calling on the government to reopen international travel and expand the number of countries on green list Ministers are expected to update the so-called traffic light list for travel on Thursday The health secretary has said ministers are working on plans to remove quarantine rules for fully vaccinated people arriving from amber countries Five years on from the Brexit referendum, the prime minister has said the historic vote to leave the EU can act as a spur to jobs and renewal across the UK The former Conservative industry secretary, Lord Heseltine,Â has described the government's approach to engaging with businesses as 'chaotic' Emails obtained by the BBC suggest the PM's former aide Dominic Cummings tried to bypass Whitehall practise, to fast track a Â£530,000 grant to an external data team Edited by Johanna Howitt BBC Politics We'll close our coverage now of this week's PMQs. The team on board today were Paul Seddon, Richard Morris and  Sinead Wilson. As we mentioned earlier, the vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi will be hosting a press briefing in Downing Street at 17:00 BST.  Our colleagues on theBBC Coronavirus live pagewill bring you full coverage there. Thanks for following along with us here today. Reality Check At Prime Ministerâs
Questions, Boris Johnson said the government had invested âanother Â£85mâ in the
Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) to help improve the record on rape
prosecutions. Thatâs true, but it comes off the back of budget cuts of 25% to
the Ministry of Justice, including the CPS, since 2010-11. CPS staff numbers fell by
2,374 between 2010-11 and 2019-20. In the year to the end of
March 2020, 58,856 cases of rape were recorded by police forces in England and
Wales. In the same year (although
this will not necessarily be the same cases due to the time it takes for them
to move through the criminal justice system) there were just 2,102
prosecutions, compared with 4,536 in 2014-15 â more than halving. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Here's a quick round up of what was said at today's question time: Reality Check Boris Johnson has been talking about the EU Settlement
Scheme that allows EU nationals living in the UK to maintain their rights after
Brexit. âIt has produced 5.6 million applications already and I seem
to remember that we were told there were only 3.2 million or 3 million to begin
with,â he said. He switched between referring to 5.6 million applications
and 5.6 million people. Itâs not the same thing as there are some duplicates. But there have been five million successful applications, which is considerably
more than the estimate for the number of EU nationals living in the UK. The Office for National Statistics is working on new methods
to come up with bettermigration statistics,external. You can read more about ithere. Conservative Theresa Villiers also raises the issue of planning and asks if the PM will reassure residents that they will have a say over what is built in their neighbourhood. The PM says ""yes indeed"". He says he won't have the new Planning Bill ""misrepresented by anybody""  because ministers want to give people the chance of home ownership. He says he wants to ""relieve pressure on the over-heating south east"" and ""build back better across the whole of the UK"". Also by video link, Labour MP Bell Ribeiro-Addy says that scientists have warned that variants of coronavirus could reduce the effectiveness of vaccines. She says that intellectual property laws are slowing down the roll-out of the vaccine globally. Boris Johnson says the G7 have agreed to another billion vaccines on top of the billion already promised. He says vaccines are effective against all variants that ""we can currently see"". Conservative Esther McVey asks the prime minister if the HS2 project will soon no longer become ""value for money"" or whether he will see it through despite the high cost. She says it is a ""white elephant"" and the money would be better spent on delivering high-speed broadband. Boris Johnson says broadband coverage is important, but says he does not agree with her on HS2. Labour MP Janet Daby says yesterday was Windrush Day, ""yet this year it's a reminder of the appalling failure"" of the Windrush Compensation Scheme. She says at least 21 people have died while awaiting payments, and only 687 people have received any compensation at all. Boris Johnson says he accepts ""the injustice that was done to the Windrush Generation"" and he wants to make sure that payments from the scheme are ""accelerated"". He says in the future he wants Windrush to be associated a positive message, of those who came to the UK to work and help the country. Conservative Andrew Mitchell asks about the announcement from the foreign office that Britain is to cut its support for tackling neglected tropical diseases by 95%. He says this means tablets and vaccines will be destroyed as a result so has the PM had a chance to review the decision he asks and will he have a vote in the Commons on cuts to aid spending? Boris Johnson says there will be a debate on overseas aid but he does not accept this view of the country's contribution to the fight of disease around the world. The UK is contributing Â£10bn this year the PM says, in spite of the ""colossal spending"" the government has been forced to make to look after families and support jobs in this country during the pandemic. The SNP's Owen Thompson accuses the government of wanting to ""neuter"" the Electoral Commission, the watchdog that oversees political financing in the UK. It comes after ministers last week announced plans to specify in law that the watchdog should not be able to bring prosecutions - a power it has previously asked for. But Boris Johnson doesn't engage, adding: ""I can say absolutely nothing"". SNP MP Philippa Whitford says that during the Brexit referendum the PM promised there'd be no rights changes for EU citizens in the UK. She says those without settled status in one week won't be able to rent property or access healthcare. She says the UK asked repeatedly for grace periods during Brexit transitions, so she asks why this can't be extended to EU citizens. Boris Johnson says the settled status scheme has been a ""great success"" and has received 5.6m applications so far. He urges any otherEU citizens who want to remain in the UKto fill out the relevant forms in the next week. Joining by video link Labour's Julie Elliott calls on the PM to condemn internet giant Amazon for ""throwing brand new tech into landfill"" - following reports it has destroyed unsold computers. She says this is ""appalling"" and is denying internet to poor children to learn remotely during the pandemic. Boris Johnson says he was ""shocked"" to hear computers were being thrown away, calling it ""bizarre and unacceptable"". He says he is sure the company ""will wish to rectify it as fast as possible"". Conservative Steve Double raises the issue of planning for new homes. He says there is a housing crisis in Cornwall with local people being priced out of the market by inflated prices due to the huge demand for  second homes. Will the  PM ensure planning reforms are not about helping the wealthy but rather to enable locals to get the homes they need, he asks. Johnson says the point has been raised repeatedly with him and he is ""determined"" to address the issue. He says the focus will be on building ""local homes for local people"". Off the back his party'sshock by-election win. Lib Dem Leader Sir Ed Davey says that people in Chesham and Amersham told him how they were worried about holding down a job and caring for family members as a family carer. He says there are ""thousands of people"" like this in every constituency in ""Conservative heartlands"". He asks what the PM will do ""to make these people's lives a little easier"" for those caring for others, unpaid. Boris Johnson says he ""salutes"" family carers. He says the government has looked after these families ""to the best of this country's ability"" and is putting ""unprecedented funds"" into adult social care. SNP Westminster leader, Ian Blackford is up. He asks if the government used an emergency Covid contract, as reported in the Herald newspaper,  to conduct constitutional  campaigning on the union. Mr Johnson says he is not aware of this. But Blackford says during the height of the pandemic emergency contracts were used to conduct political research and will the PM commit to an inquiry? Johnson says he can't think of a better use of public funds than making sure all of the UK fights the pandemic together. For his final question, Keir Starmer says ""criminals are ""getting away with it"" because of ""record low"" rape conviction rates, and ""record high"" backlogs in the court system. Blaming it on a ""decade of Conservative cuts,"" he asks the PM to take ""some responsibility"" and apologise to rape victims. In reply, Boris Johnson says ""of course I say sorry for the trauma they have been through"" due to the ""inadequacies"" of the justice system, which he vows ministers will improve. He says the government is focusing on recovering from the pandemic - goading Labour with the charge that ""they jabber, we jab"". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer says he spent ""five years as Director of Public Prosecutions"" and so he knows the ""impact of cuts"". He says the government can't make cuts to the Crown Prosecution Service and close ""half of courts in England and Wales"" and think that a modest increase in funding will fix problems.

LiveLiveTravel industry demands easing of UK Covid rules14 minutes ago,"Vaccine hesitancy has significantly dropped in the UK's Black and Asian communities, Vaccines Minister Nadhim Zahawi says He tells a Downing St briefing 82% of all adults in the UK have had a first vaccine dose and three in five have had both jabs Only a week after the programme opened to all adults on Friday, one third of 18-24-year-olds have had their first doses, he adds In January, the vast majority of hospital admissions were aged over 65 but now just a third are, Zahawi says This really does show the importance of getting the jab and, critically, getting the second dose, he says UK travel bosses call on the government to expand the green list and reopen international travel They say it is ""now or never"" to save what is left of the summer season - not just for holidaymakers but to protect jobs Meanwhile, scientists are trialling whether a drug called Ivermectin could help treat Covid symptoms Questions are being asked over whether Wembley should host the Euro 2020 final, amid concerns over Delta variant cases in the UK Edited by James Clarke, Rob Corp and Claire Heald Thanks for following our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic today.

We are going to be wrapping up our live coverage of coronavirus soon so here's a recap on the day's news:  This video can not be played Covid vaccine: 'Your vaccine is an evergreen offer' Dr Nikki Kanani has encouraged everyone to come forward for their vaccine. Speaking at a Downing Street briefing she said:
""Your vaccine has a name on it, it is for you, and it is an evergreen offer"". Sir Elton wants to spend more time with his husband David Furnish and their two sons, Zachary and Elijah Sir Elton John's Farewell Yellow Brick Road tour has announced a further five stadium concerts in the UK in 2022. The 74-year-old star will perform in Norwich, Liverpool, Sunderland and Bristol, concluding in Swansea on 29 June 2022. The singer was forced to postpone a string of dates last year because of the pandemic. Tour dates announced for 2022 will also include a number of European cities, with performances scheduled in Paris, Frankfurt and Milan - before winding up the year with back-to-back performances at the Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles on 19 and 20 November. In January 2023, Sir Elton will travel to New Zealand for two shows, continuing on to Australia where the four-year tour will formally come to an end. ""The shows that I announce today will be my final tour dates ever in North America and Europe,"" says Sir Elton. ""I'm going to go out in the biggest possible way - performing at my very best, with the most spectacular production I've ever had, playing in places that have meant so much to me throughout my career."" UK Vaccines Minister Nadhim Zahawi has just finished giving a coronavirus briefing. Here's what we learned: Barnie Choudhury, from Eastern Eye newspaper, says by his calculations one in six people in Pakistani and Bangladeshi communities still haven't been vaccinated or got their second jab. He asks: ""Why is the government failing to meet these communities six months after the start of the programme?"" He says the panel had talked about visiting restaurants and mosques but asks: ""What else are you doing to reach those hard to reach communities - those vaccine deniers - to get a second jab?"" Nadzim Zahawi says the government has set up a ""connect and exchange hub"" to share best practice of what really works and work out how how to scale it. He says there was a vaccine pop-up in a Brent mosque and an event with Diane Abbot and the Haredi Hasidic Jewish community, which saw 364 members of the community coming forward to be vaccinated. ""It's incumbent on all of us to take what works and really scale it between now and 19 July"", he says. Helen CattPolitical correspondent As expected, the message from the vaccines minister was 'get the jab', particularly if it's your second dose. He delivered his message with a lot of numbers:  It's the sort of data that ministers will be pleased to see, particularly an increased take-up among some communities - which had been more hesitant about having the vaccine. But it suggests there is still some way to go before 19 July and the potential final lifting of restrictions on social contact. So there was another push to Asian communities and to the over-40s to get their second doses faster. Asad Ali from UK24 says many people in the Pakistani and Bangladeshi community are receiving false messages from unknown numbers on WhatsApp saying you could die from having the vaccination, or that the vaccine causes infertility. He asks what the government is doing to stop misleading information? Nadhim Zahawi says the vaccines are ""incredibly safe"" and are rated as such by the independent medicines regulatory body, which is not influenced by government. That sort of disinformation is incredibly harmful to the UK and globally, he states. He says the UK government has partnered with academic institutions to get the positive messaging of vaccination around the world. The next question comes from Channel 4. How worried is the minister and health chiefs about the Delta-plus variant? And there's a second part to the question about Covid travel passports. Nadhim Zahawi says viruses continue to mutate - but the good news is the vaccines are incredibly effective against the Delta variant. On Covid travel passports, he thinks a combination of proof of double-vaccination alongside testing is the way forward. On the subject ofthe new Delta-plus variant, Public Health England's Head of Immunisation Mary Ramsay says the UK has the "" best system in the world"" for picking up these cases, and reminds us they have only seen 41 cases of this variant in this country. ""We're on top of the situation,"" she says. Adina Campbell from BBC says people are less likely to have had a vaccine if they are black - is it time to take a new approach? She says the symptoms of the Delta variant are now recognised to include headache, runny nose and sore throat - she asks if the website should be updated to reflect this? Zahawi says since 1 April to date the additional uptake in white community is 3% but in Black and Black Afro-Caribbean communities it is 7% and in the Pakistani and Bangladeshi communities it has grown by 10%. He says this is due to the uptake strategy launched in February which includes community champions and extra resources for GP surgeries. On the Delta variant he says ""it's important we always update our information"" and urged people to get their jabs. This video can not be played Vaccines minister: 'Vaccine hesitancy has halved amongst black and black British people' Vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi says the UK's vaccination programme has passed another key milestone - with more than 60% of the adult population now fully vaccinated. Speaking at a Downing Street briefing he says: ""The vaccination programme has been delivered in the community, by the community and for the community"". Emily Morgan from ITV News says the government has been trying to persuade certain people from certain backgrounds to get the vaccine ""for months"". She asks at what point the government will accept that not everyone can be reached or accept the vaccine? Nadhim Zahawi says the government is straining every sinew to make sure that everyone has access to the vaccine. He says it is also about sharing data to ensure local health teams can see who has and hasn't been vaccinated. ""We've got to keep going, it's incumbent on all of us"" to keep getting people vaccinated, Zahawi says. He says he doesn't think he will ever stop encouraging people to get the vaccine. Alongside him, NHS England's vaccines boss Mary Ramsay says the government has to just keep going with encouragement. Andrew in Chichester asks why so many Covid vaccination centres are being closed when people still need to be vaccinated. Vaccines Minister Nadhim Zahawi says the deployment infrastructure can deliver many more vaccines and the record is 24 jabs a second. He says local systems are able to decide how we deploy and how we deliver vaccines, potentially focusing more on walk-in centres and mobile vaccination centres where needed. He says this means some vaccination sites are stood down so other areas with greater need can get vaccinations. Dr Nikki Kanani says vaccine centres are not closing, it is just that staff are busy working vaccinating people in other areas. We go to questions from the publicand Anna says that figures show most people going into hospital with Covid now have not been vaccinated. She asks if these are people who have chosen not to have jab or are they of an age where the rollout hasn't reached them yet? She also asks if they will hold back the freedoms of others already vaccinated? The vaccines minister says 60% of hospitalisations from the Delta variant are unvaccinated, but people are still coming forward for their jabs. Nadhim Zahawi says: ""We keep going at pace to make sure we protect the whole country because the virus will attempt to survive by finding people that are unprotected and then infecting them - particularly communities that are close knit."" He says he is ""confident"" that we will have 66% of the adult population with the protection of two jabs by 19 July. Dr Nikki Kanani, the medical director of Primary Care for NHS England is up next. She starts on a positive note, reiterating the figures of vaccine uptake which show the success of the vaccination programme - and thanks those working behind the scenes to deliver the programme, as well as those getting a vaccine. She says the vaccination programme continues in full swing, adding that while it is ""overwhelmingly positive"", ""we know some people are still anxious about coming forward for their vaccine"". Tackling vaccine hesitancy has been at the heart of our programme, she says. We continue to close the gap with more people from ethnic minorities coming forward and uptake is increasing faster in Black-African and Pakistani communities than in white backgrounds now, she adds. Between mid-March and mid-June uptake in Black and Asian communities rose - from 75% to 86% in Asian communities and 55% to 68% in Black communities. In his statement, the vaccines minister says the rollout has been delivered in places of worship across the whole of the UK. He says there have been open two-way conversations about the vaccines and how safe they are. He says this ""concerted community effort"" has really paid off. Vaccine hesitancy has halved among Black and Black British people since February. And it's halved in Asian and Asian British people in the same period, he says. But there is ""much more to do"" before we can take the final step on the road to recovery, he says. Mary Ramsay goes on to say that the number of people testing positive for Covid is increasing, but is not growing at the rate that happened during the second wave of the pandemic in England. She says hospitalisations and severe illnesses are being prevented by people being double vaccinated against Covid. Mary Ramsay, Head of Immunisation for NHS England, thanks those working across the NHS and Public Health England so that ""we can really inform ourselves"" on how best the UK can deal with the Delta variant. She says two doses of the vaccine has ""over 90%"" effectiveness against hospitalisation from the Delta variant of Covid-19. She reminds the public of the importance of other vaccines, not just the ones against Covid - for babies, school pupils and leavers and those aged over 70. Nadhim Zahawi says: ""Our mission is now to get as many people protected as we can and to protect them as quickly as we can."" The government made the ""difficult but essential decision"" to pause step four of the roadmap for four weeks with a review at two weeks, he says. (The move that meant a relaxation of England's coronavirus restrictions did not happen on Monday.) The time will be used to get jabs into the arms of those most vulnerable to Covid before restrictions are eased, he says. Two weeks ago, there were more than two million people in England over the age of 50 who had had a first dose but not a second. Now that number is 900,000, he says. Â© 2025 BBC.

He says this means some vaccination sites are stood down so other areas with greater need can get vaccinations. Dr Nikki Kanani says vaccine centres are not closing, it is just that staff are busy working vaccinating people in other areas. We go to questions from the publicand Anna says that figures show most people going into hospital with Covid now have not been vaccinated. She asks if these are people who have chosen not to have jab or are they of an age where the rollout hasn't reached them yet? She also asks if they will hold back the freedoms of others already vaccinated? The vaccines minister says 60% of hospitalisations from the Delta variant are unvaccinated, but people are still coming forward for their jabs. Nadhim Zahawi says: ""We keep going at pace to make sure we protect the whole country because the virus will attempt to survive by finding people that are unprotected and then infecting them - particularly communities that are close knit."" He says he is ""confident"" that we will have 66% of the adult population with the protection of two jabs by 19 July. Dr Nikki Kanani, the medical director of Primary Care for NHS England is up next. She starts on a positive note, reiterating the figures of vaccine uptake which show the success of the vaccination programme - and thanks those working behind the scenes to deliver the programme, as well as those getting a vaccine. She says the vaccination programme continues in full swing, adding that while it is ""overwhelmingly positive"", ""we know some people are still anxious about coming forward for their vaccine"". Tackling vaccine hesitancy has been at the heart of our programme, she says. We continue to close the gap with more people from ethnic minorities coming forward and uptake is increasing faster in Black-African and Pakistani communities than in white backgrounds now, she adds. Between mid-March and mid-June uptake in Black and Asian communities rose - from 75% to 86% in Asian communities and 55% to 68% in Black communities. In his statement, the vaccines minister says the rollout has been delivered in places of worship across the whole of the UK. He says there have been open two-way conversations about the vaccines and how safe they are. He says this ""concerted community effort"" has really paid off. Vaccine hesitancy has halved among Black and Black British people since February. And it's halved in Asian and Asian British people in the same period, he says. But there is ""much more to do"" before we can take the final step on the road to recovery, he says. Mary Ramsay goes on to say that the number of people testing positive for Covid is increasing, but is not growing at the rate that happened during the second wave of the pandemic in England. She says hospitalisations and severe illnesses are being prevented by people being double vaccinated against Covid. Mary Ramsay, Head of Immunisation for NHS England, thanks those working across the NHS and Public Health England so that ""we can really inform ourselves"" on how best the UK can deal with the Delta variant. She says two doses of the vaccine has ""over 90%"" effectiveness against hospitalisation from the Delta variant of Covid-19. She reminds the public of the importance of other vaccines, not just the ones against Covid - for babies, school pupils and leavers and those aged over 70. Nadhim Zahawi says: ""Our mission is now to get as many people protected as we can and to protect them as quickly as we can."" The government made the ""difficult but essential decision"" to pause step four of the roadmap for four weeks with a review at two weeks, he says. (The move that meant a relaxation of England's coronavirus restrictions did not happen on Monday.) The time will be used to get jabs into the arms of those most vulnerable to Covid before restrictions are eased, he says. Two weeks ago, there were more than two million people in England over the age of 50 who had had a first dose but not a second. Now that number is 900,000, he says. Â© 2025 BBC.

""Your vaccine has a name on it, it is for you, and it is an evergreen offer"". Sir Elton wants to spend more time with his husband David Furnish and their two sons, Zachary and Elijah Sir Elton John's Farewell Yellow Brick Road tour has announced a further five stadium concerts in the UK in 2022. The 74-year-old star will perform in Norwich, Liverpool, Sunderland and Bristol, concluding in Swansea on 29 June 2022. The singer was forced to postpone a string of dates last year because of the pandemic. Tour dates announced for 2022 will also include a number of European cities, with performances scheduled in Paris, Frankfurt and Milan - before winding up the year with back-to-back performances at the Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles on 19 and 20 November. In January 2023, Sir Elton will travel to New Zealand for two shows, continuing on to Australia where the four-year tour will formally come to an end. ""The shows that I announce today will be my final tour dates ever in North America and Europe,"" says Sir Elton. ""I'm going to go out in the biggest possible way - performing at my very best, with the most spectacular production I've ever had, playing in places that have meant so much to me throughout my career."" UK Vaccines Minister Nadhim Zahawi has just finished giving a coronavirus briefing. Here's what we learned: Barnie Choudhury, from Eastern Eye newspaper, says by his calculations one in six people in Pakistani and Bangladeshi communities still haven't been vaccinated or got their second jab. He asks: ""Why is the government failing to meet these communities six months after the start of the programme?"" He says the panel had talked about visiting restaurants and mosques but asks: ""What else are you doing to reach those hard to reach communities - those vaccine deniers - to get a second jab?"" Nadzim Zahawi says the government has set up a ""connect and exchange hub"" to share best practice of what really works and work out how how to scale it. He says there was a vaccine pop-up in a Brent mosque and an event with Diane Abbot and the Haredi Hasidic Jewish community, which saw 364 members of the community coming forward to be vaccinated. ""It's incumbent on all of us to take what works and really scale it between now and 19 July"", he says. Helen CattPolitical correspondent As expected, the message from the vaccines minister was 'get the jab', particularly if it's your second dose. He delivered his message with a lot of numbers:  It's the sort of data that ministers will be pleased to see, particularly an increased take-up among some communities - which had been more hesitant about having the vaccine. But it suggests there is still some way to go before 19 July and the potential final lifting of restrictions on social contact. So there was another push to Asian communities and to the over-40s to get their second doses faster. Asad Ali from UK24 says many people in the Pakistani and Bangladeshi community are receiving false messages from unknown numbers on WhatsApp saying you could die from having the vaccination, or that the vaccine causes infertility. He asks what the government is doing to stop misleading information? Nadhim Zahawi says the vaccines are ""incredibly safe"" and are rated as such by the independent medicines regulatory body, which is not influenced by government. That sort of disinformation is incredibly harmful to the UK and globally, he states. He says the UK government has partnered with academic institutions to get the positive messaging of vaccination around the world. The next question comes from Channel 4. How worried is the minister and health chiefs about the Delta-plus variant? And there's a second part to the question about Covid travel passports. Nadhim Zahawi says viruses continue to mutate - but the good news is the vaccines are incredibly effective against the Delta variant. On Covid travel passports, he thinks a combination of proof of double-vaccination alongside testing is the way forward. On the subject ofthe new Delta-plus variant, Public Health England's Head of Immunisation Mary Ramsay says the UK has the "" best system in the world"" for picking up these cases, and reminds us they have only seen 41 cases of this variant in this country. ""We're on top of the situation,"" she says. Adina Campbell from BBC says people are less likely to have had a vaccine if they are black - is it time to take a new approach? She says the symptoms of the Delta variant are now recognised to include headache, runny nose and sore throat - she asks if the website should be updated to reflect this? Zahawi says since 1 April to date the additional uptake in white community is 3% but in Black and Black Afro-Caribbean communities it is 7% and in the Pakistani and Bangladeshi communities it has grown by 10%. He says this is due to the uptake strategy launched in February which includes community champions and extra resources for GP surgeries. On the Delta variant he says ""it's important we always update our information"" and urged people to get their jabs. This video can not be played Vaccines minister: 'Vaccine hesitancy has halved amongst black and black British people' Vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi says the UK's vaccination programme has passed another key milestone - with more than 60% of the adult population now fully vaccinated. Speaking at a Downing Street briefing he says: ""The vaccination programme has been delivered in the community, by the community and for the community"". Emily Morgan from ITV News says the government has been trying to persuade certain people from certain backgrounds to get the vaccine ""for months"". She asks at what point the government will accept that not everyone can be reached or accept the vaccine? Nadhim Zahawi says the government is straining every sinew to make sure that everyone has access to the vaccine. He says it is also about sharing data to ensure local health teams can see who has and hasn't been vaccinated. ""We've got to keep going, it's incumbent on all of us"" to keep getting people vaccinated, Zahawi says. He says he doesn't think he will ever stop encouraging people to get the vaccine. Alongside him, NHS England's vaccines boss Mary Ramsay says the government has to just keep going with encouragement. Andrew in Chichester asks why so many Covid vaccination centres are being closed when people still need to be vaccinated.

Trust in news has 'grown in UK during pandemic',"Leading politicians and scientific advisors have regularly faced questions from the media throughout the coronavirus pandemic Trust in news coverage has grown in the UK with the public appetite for reliable reporting increasing during the pandemic, research suggests. The Reuters Institute Digital News Report, conducted in January this year, found 44% of people in the UK ""trust most news most of the time"". That figure is up on the previous year 2020, before the pandemic began. But it is still 14 percentage points down on where it was prior to the Brexit vote in 2016. The report found strictly regulated impartial broadcasters such as BBC, ITV, Sky News, and Channel 4 remained the most trusted, followed by national broadsheet newspapers. It also showed trust in particular brands often split along both political and/or generational lines. ""We also find that political partisans from both sides feel that UK media coverage has been unfair to them,"" the report said. The UK was just one of 46 media markets around the world that were surveyed on the topic of trustworthiness. About 92,000 people were involved, including more than 2,000 in the UK. Many young people - especially young women - it suggested, felt that media coverage was less fair to them than it is to other groups. In the US, three-quarters of those who self-identified as being on the right, politically-speaking, felt that media coverage of their views was unfair, compared with just a third of those on the left. Donald Trump supporters protesting outside the White House in January grabbed the headlines Black and Hispanic Americans are also more likely to say media coverage is unfair. Finland remained the country with the highest levels of overall trust (65%) in news content, whereas the USA had the lowest levels (29%), the survey found. Trust in news across all countries grew by an average of six percentage points in the wake of the pandemic, with 44% saying they trust most news most of the time. The growth of social media over the past decade, the report suggested, has encouraged the growth of news sites and channels with overtly partisan lines. However, people on the whole still strongly support the ideals of impartial and objective news. Lead author of the report, Nic Newman, said: ""The focus on factual reporting during the Covid-19 crisis may have made the news seem more straightforward, while the story has also had the effect of squeezing out more partisan political news. ""This may be a temporary effect, but in almost all countries we see audiences placing a greater premium on accurate and reliable news sources."" Print publications have been badly affected by Covid-19 Print publications, the study showed, have been badly affected by Covid-19, due to restrictions on movement affecting sales. Subscriptions or one-off payments to digital news publications were up by two points in the last year - with countries like the USA, Finland and Australia relying more on online news. However, in the UK it remains a minority activity, with just 8% of people saying they currently pay for any online news. Although many people appear to have engaged with news over the past 12 months, researchers also found signs that some are avoiding news altogether. For instance, the study found interest in news had fallen in the United States following the election of President Joe Biden - especially with right-leaning groups. Worries about misinformation remained high, with 58% of those asked expressing concern about what is true or false on the internet when it comes to news. More respondents said they had seen greater misinformation about coronavirus than any other subject, including politics. TikTok has become an increasingly popular source of news for young people A quarter of people overall said they preferred to start their news journeys via a website or app. Those aged 18-24 (known as Generation Z) were found to have weak links with traditional news sites and were almost twice as likely to prefer accessing news via social media, aggregators, or mobile alerts. Platforms like WhatsApp, Instagram, Telegram and TikTok have continued to attract more young people, with many sharing stories about coronavirus and Black Lives Matter on the latter over the past year. That particular network has also been central to a wave of protests by younger people across the world, in countries like Indonesia, Peru and Thailand. Influencers, the report established, play a much bigger role in news on TikTok, Snapchat and Instagram than they do in more ""traditional"" networks like Facebook and Twitter. Co-author of the report, Simge Andi, said: ""The lack of strong journalistic presence could make those relying on these networks particularly vulnerable to misinformation. ""On the other hand, news is largely incidental in these spaces and the expectations of snappy, visual, and entertaining content do not always come naturally to newsrooms staffed by senior journalists with a focus on traditional formats.""

NHS trust appeals against puberty blockers rulingThe appeal centres around whether under-16s can consent to using puberty blockers.,"Keira Bell said the gender identity clinic should have challenged her more The Court of Appeal is considering whether under-16s can give informed consent to medical treatment that delays the onset of puberty. The appeal is brought by the Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust. It says puberty blockers give children distressed by their birth sex time to consider ""options"". But a representative for Keira Bell, who brought the original case, says children cannot understand all of the treatment's implications. Judgement is reserved for a later date. The two-day appeal also includes submissions from LGBT and other interested groups. In December 2020, the High Court ruled that under-16s wereunlikely to be able to give informed consent to what it described as ""experimental"" treatment, which is sometimes used to pause puberty in children experiencing gender dysphoria. Keira Bell, one of the claimants in the case, started taking puberty blockers at the age of 16 after being referred to the Tavistock and Portman Trust, which runs the UK's only Gender Identity Development Service (Gids). Now in her mid-20s, saysshe regrets her decision to transition to a male, and says the clinic should have challenged her more. Speaking outside the Appeal Court on Wednesday morning, she said: ""I'm always hopeful, but the result could go any way."" The Tavistock has argued throughout that it provides safe treatment and puts the best interests of young people and their families first. What are puberty blockers? On Wednesday, Fenella Moss QC, representing the Trust, argued that the High Court's original judgement was wrong to find the use of puberty blockers for gender dysphoria was ""experimental"". Ms Morris said that puberty blockers are deemed fully reversible in international guidelines, and that ""not providing treatment means that the child remains in a position of distress and difficulties in making choices about what to do next"". She argued that it is not inevitable that a young person would continue on to taking cross-sex hormones  -which the NHS advises cause some irreversible changes,external- after puberty blockers. Children and young people are told about effects on their fertility that may be caused by later stages of transition, she added. ""There is no suggestion anywhere that this is one pathway... there is no shying away from explaining to children and young people what the possibilities are."" The trust that runs the gender identity clinic is appealing the decision Jeremy Hyam QC, representing Ms Bell and Mrs A, the other claimant, argued that the appeal should fail as it did not find any ""material errors"" in the original ruling. In written arguments, he said: ""The need for a child to understand, retain and weigh up the salient facts is all the more important because, unlike life-saving cancer treatment, there is much uncertainty as to what the benefits of puberty blockers actually are."" In court on Wednesday, he added: ""Right at the heart of what the court was concerned about was how can it be said that children of 10, 11, 12 have any proper conception of what sexual function is?"" Nine organisations or individuals - including human rights group Liberty and The Endocrine Society - have given evidence in the appeal. In a separate case in March,external, the Family Division of the High Court ruled that parents could give consent for under-16s to access puberty blockers. But it said it may be that ""additional safeguards"" should be put in place, such as the requirement for an independent second opinion. Puberty blockers are drugs that suppress the release of hormones produced in much bigger quantities during puberty. They are sometimes used to treat gender dysphoria, which the NHS describes as ""a sense of unease that a person may have because of a mismatch between their biological sex and their gender identity"". Gids says puberty blockers allow a young person ""time to consider their options and to continue to explore their developing gender identity before making decisions about irreversible forms of treatment"". It advises that while the effects are physically reversible if treatment is stopped, the full psychological effects - or whether it alters the course of adolescent brain development - aren't known. The NHS says ""little is known"" about the long term side effects,externalin young people with gender dysphoria, including whether the treatment affects the development of the teenage brain or children's bones. Puberty blockers are also used to treat conditions which cause premature puberty in much younger children. This is the most contentious of areas. Partly because opinions will vary hugely on the age at which a child can understand the impact of a decision made in their early teens on the life they will lead as an adult. And partly because at its heart lie the futures of young people struggling with their gender identity, who may already feel marginalised, misunderstood and harmed by delays in treatment. The Court of Appeal hearing has so far revolved around two key areas. Firstly, whether under-16's can truly consent to puberty blockers when their feelings about, for instance, their fertility may change substantially in the next decade. Secondly, whether that treatment is experimental. The High Court concluded it was. The Tavistock disagrees, throughout it has pointed to prescription of the drugs by doctors going back more than twenty years. It will be for the Appeal Court to settle these arguments, but the case has already underlined the importance of more research in this complex area. Puberty blockers review group to be set up by NHS What does transgender mean and what does the law say? In the December ruling,external, Dame Victoria Sharp, sitting with Lord Justice Lewis and Mrs Justice Lieven, said: ""It is doubtful that a child aged 14 or 15 could understand and weigh the long-term risks and consequences of the administration of puberty blockers."" The judges added it was ""highly unlikely"" that children aged 13 and under would have the capacity to give consent. Mermaids, which provides services for young people and their families who struggle with their gender identity, says that decision, ""put a further strain on the already marginalised transgender and non-binary community and their families"". ""We believe strongly that trans and non-binary children should have the same rights over their healthcare decisions as anyone else, in line with their evolving understanding,"" the charity said in a statement. Transgender Trend, an organisation made up of parents, professionals and academics who are ""concerned about the current trend to diagnose children as transgender,"" has submitted evidence to the hearing. Founder Stephanie Davies-Arai said: ""Children do not have the maturity or life experience to give informed consent to medical interventions with such devastating long-term consequences and we hope and expect that the Appeal Court will uphold the High Court's judgement"".

Questions, Boris Johnson said the government had invested âanother Â£85mâ in the
Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) to help improve the record on rape
prosecutions. Thatâs true, but it comes off the back of budget cuts of 25% to
the Ministry of Justice, including the CPS, since 2010-11. CPS staff numbers fell by
2,374 between 2010-11 and 2019-20. In the year to the end of
March 2020, 58,856 cases of rape were recorded by police forces in England and
Wales. In the same year (although
this will not necessarily be the same cases due to the time it takes for them
to move through the criminal justice system) there were just 2,102
prosecutions, compared with 4,536 in 2014-15 â more than halving. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Here's a quick round up of what was said at today's question time: Reality Check Boris Johnson has been talking about the EU Settlement
Scheme that allows EU nationals living in the UK to maintain their rights after
Brexit. âIt has produced 5.6 million applications already and I seem
to remember that we were told there were only 3.2 million or 3 million to begin
with,â he said. He switched between referring to 5.6 million applications
and 5.6 million people. Itâs not the same thing as there are some duplicates. But there have been five million successful applications, which is considerably
more than the estimate for the number of EU nationals living in the UK. The Office for National Statistics is working on new methods
to come up with bettermigration statistics,external. You can read more about ithere. Conservative Theresa Villiers also raises the issue of planning and asks if the PM will reassure residents that they will have a say over what is built in their neighbourhood. The PM says ""yes indeed"". He says he won't have the new Planning Bill ""misrepresented by anybody""  because ministers want to give people the chance of home ownership. He says he wants to ""relieve pressure on the over-heating south east"" and ""build back better across the whole of the UK"". Also by video link, Labour MP Bell Ribeiro-Addy says that scientists have warned that variants of coronavirus could reduce the effectiveness of vaccines. She says that intellectual property laws are slowing down the roll-out of the vaccine globally. Boris Johnson says the G7 have agreed to another billion vaccines on top of the billion already promised. He says vaccines are effective against all variants that ""we can currently see"". Conservative Esther McVey asks the prime minister if the HS2 project will soon no longer become ""value for money"" or whether he will see it through despite the high cost. She says it is a ""white elephant"" and the money would be better spent on delivering high-speed broadband. Boris Johnson says broadband coverage is important, but says he does not agree with her on HS2. Labour MP Janet Daby says yesterday was Windrush Day, ""yet this year it's a reminder of the appalling failure"" of the Windrush Compensation Scheme. She says at least 21 people have died while awaiting payments, and only 687 people have received any compensation at all. Boris Johnson says he accepts ""the injustice that was done to the Windrush Generation"" and he wants to make sure that payments from the scheme are ""accelerated"". He says in the future he wants Windrush to be associated a positive message, of those who came to the UK to work and help the country. Conservative Andrew Mitchell asks about the announcement from the foreign office that Britain is to cut its support for tackling neglected tropical diseases by 95%. He says this means tablets and vaccines will be destroyed as a result so has the PM had a chance to review the decision he asks and will he have a vote in the Commons on cuts to aid spending? Boris Johnson says there will be a debate on overseas aid but he does not accept this view of the country's contribution to the fight of disease around the world. The UK is contributing Â£10bn this year the PM says, in spite of the ""colossal spending"" the government has been forced to make to look after families and support jobs in this country during the pandemic. The SNP's Owen Thompson accuses the government of wanting to ""neuter"" the Electoral Commission, the watchdog that oversees political financing in the UK. It comes after ministers last week announced plans to specify in law that the watchdog should not be able to bring prosecutions - a power it has previously asked for. But Boris Johnson doesn't engage, adding: ""I can say absolutely nothing"". SNP MP Philippa Whitford says that during the Brexit referendum the PM promised there'd be no rights changes for EU citizens in the UK. She says those without settled status in one week won't be able to rent property or access healthcare. She says the UK asked repeatedly for grace periods during Brexit transitions, so she asks why this can't be extended to EU citizens. Boris Johnson says the settled status scheme has been a ""great success"" and has received 5.6m applications so far. He urges any otherEU citizens who want to remain in the UKto fill out the relevant forms in the next week. Joining by video link Labour's Julie Elliott calls on the PM to condemn internet giant Amazon for ""throwing brand new tech into landfill"" - following reports it has destroyed unsold computers. She says this is ""appalling"" and is denying internet to poor children to learn remotely during the pandemic. Boris Johnson says he was ""shocked"" to hear computers were being thrown away, calling it ""bizarre and unacceptable"". He says he is sure the company ""will wish to rectify it as fast as possible"". Conservative Steve Double raises the issue of planning for new homes. He says there is a housing crisis in Cornwall with local people being priced out of the market by inflated prices due to the huge demand for  second homes. Will the  PM ensure planning reforms are not about helping the wealthy but rather to enable locals to get the homes they need, he asks. Johnson says the point has been raised repeatedly with him and he is ""determined"" to address the issue. He says the focus will be on building ""local homes for local people"". Off the back his party'sshock by-election win. Lib Dem Leader Sir Ed Davey says that people in Chesham and Amersham told him how they were worried about holding down a job and caring for family members as a family carer. He says there are ""thousands of people"" like this in every constituency in ""Conservative heartlands"". He asks what the PM will do ""to make these people's lives a little easier"" for those caring for others, unpaid. Boris Johnson says he ""salutes"" family carers. He says the government has looked after these families ""to the best of this country's ability"" and is putting ""unprecedented funds"" into adult social care. SNP Westminster leader, Ian Blackford is up. He asks if the government used an emergency Covid contract, as reported in the Herald newspaper,  to conduct constitutional  campaigning on the union. Mr Johnson says he is not aware of this. But Blackford says during the height of the pandemic emergency contracts were used to conduct political research and will the PM commit to an inquiry? Johnson says he can't think of a better use of public funds than making sure all of the UK fights the pandemic together. For his final question, Keir Starmer says ""criminals are ""getting away with it"" because of ""record low"" rape conviction rates, and ""record high"" backlogs in the court system. Blaming it on a ""decade of Conservative cuts,"" he asks the PM to take ""some responsibility"" and apologise to rape victims. In reply, Boris Johnson says ""of course I say sorry for the trauma they have been through"" due to the ""inadequacies"" of the justice system, which he vows ministers will improve. He says the government is focusing on recovering from the pandemic - goading Labour with the charge that ""they jabber, we jab"". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer says he spent ""five years as Director of Public Prosecutions"" and so he knows the ""impact of cuts"". He says the government can't make cuts to the Crown Prosecution Service and close ""half of courts in England and Wales"" and think that a modest increase in funding will fix problems. He says the government's so-called rape review is ""unambitious"" and does nothing to address the ""epidemic of violence against women and girls"". Boris Johnson says the government has brought in the ""landmark"" violence against women and girls legislation. He says Labour voted against increasing sentences for serious sexual offences. Starmer says the PM's response is ""appalling"". We have ""terrible"" rates of conviction and prosecution for rape he says and victims are being failed so does the PM accept that cuts to the criminal justice system have contributed to this? The PM says ""no"" that is not the case. He says funding has increased and rather it is a lack of joined up thinking in the system that is to blame. He says police numbers are up and more investment is going in. Keir Starmer says Labour declined to support the government's sentencing bill because it did ""more to protect statues than women"". He asks what section of the bill ""will do anything"" to increase the number of reported rapes that result in a charge being brought. He says this is currently not the case in 98.4% of reported rapes. The prime minister points to a section of the bill to get rid of the early release people who have already been convicted of rape at the halfway point in their sentence. He says the government is also investing to ensure there are advisers so that rape victims and survivors ""have people in whom they can confide and trust"". Â© 2025 BBC.

"Royal Academy apologises to artist Jess de WahlsThe arts institution says it ""had no right to judge her views"" after removing her work from its shop.","Jess de Wahls creates hand-sewn portraits from recycled clothes The Royal Academy of Arts has apologised to artist Jess de Wahls after removing her work from its gift shop following complaints that she had expressed transphobic views. Her embroidery was removed after a backlash over comments she made in 2019 saying ""humans can not change sex"". De Wahls, who denies transphobia, said she ""appreciates"" the apology. ""We had no right to judge her views,"" the prestigious London institution said ina statement,externalon Wednesday. ""There has been a great deal of debate around the RA's recent communication about no longer stocking the work of Jess de Wahls in the Royal Academy shop,"" it said. ""We have thought long and hard since then about this and the wider issues it raises. ""One thing is clear to us now - we should have handled this better. We have apologised to Jess de Wahls for the way we have treated her and do so again publicly now. We had no right to judge her views on our social media. This betrayed our most important core value - the protection of free speech.""

""The feedback I'm getting from the general public is quite the opposite [from the Royal Academy's stance]. This isn't going to go away. This is a conversation that needs to happen in public.""

In reply, Boris Johnson says ""of course I say sorry for the trauma they have been through"" due to the ""inadequacies"" of the justice system, which he vows ministers will improve. He says the government is focusing on recovering from the pandemic - goading Labour with the charge that ""they jabber, we jab"". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer says he spent ""five years as Director of Public Prosecutions"" and so he knows the ""impact of cuts"". He says the government can't make cuts to the Crown Prosecution Service and close ""half of courts in England and Wales"" and think that a modest increase in funding will fix problems. He says the government's so-called rape review is ""unambitious"" and does nothing to address the ""epidemic of violence against women and girls"". Boris Johnson says the government has brought in the ""landmark"" violence against women and girls legislation. He says Labour voted against increasing sentences for serious sexual offences. Starmer says the PM's response is ""appalling"". We have ""terrible"" rates of conviction and prosecution for rape he says and victims are being failed so does the PM accept that cuts to the criminal justice system have contributed to this? The PM says ""no"" that is not the case. He says funding has increased and rather it is a lack of joined up thinking in the system that is to blame. He says police numbers are up and more investment is going in. Keir Starmer says Labour declined to support the government's sentencing bill because it did ""more to protect statues than women"". He asks what section of the bill ""will do anything"" to increase the number of reported rapes that result in a charge being brought. He says this is currently not the case in 98.4% of reported rapes. The prime minister points to a section of the bill to get rid of the early release people who have already been convicted of rape at the halfway point in their sentence. He says the government is also investing to ensure there are advisers so that rape victims and survivors ""have people in whom they can confide and trust"". Â© 2025 BBC.

Leasehold campaigners welcome new changesPersimmon and Aviva commit to change in light of competition watchdog inquiry into sector.,"Two big players in the leasehold sector have agreed to change the way they operate, following an investigation by the competition watchdog. Housebuilder Persimmon will allow its leaseholders to buy the freehold of their property at a discount. Insurance company Aviva, which buys leaseholds from house builders, will repay homeowners who saw their ground rents double. Campaigners for leaseholders said the commitments were a ""massive milestone"". The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) launched its investigation into leaseholds in 2019 because it was worried that leaseholders were facing huge and unexpected increases in the cost of buying a freehold or massive increases in ground rents. It said the said the commitments by Persimmon and Aviva were a ""real win"". CMA chief executive Andrea Coscelli said the watchdog now expected other housing developers and investors to take similar action. ""This is a real win for thousands of leaseholders - for too long people have found themselves trapped in homes they can struggle to sell or been faced with unexpectedly high prices to buy their freehold. ""But our work isn't done. We now expect other housing developers and investors to follow the lead of Aviva and Persimmon. If not, they can expect to face legal action."" With a leasehold, the person owns a lease which gives them the right to use the property. But they still have to get their landlord's permission for any work or changes to their homes. When a leasehold flat or house is first sold, a lease is granted for a fixed period of time, typically between 99 and 125 years, but sometimes up to 999 years - although people may extend their lease or buy the freehold. But leasehold house owners are often charged expensive ground rent as well as fees if they want to make changes to their homes. A leasehold house can also be difficult to sell. Under the new commitments Aviva will remove ground rent terms the CMA considers unfair and repay homeowners who saw rents doubled. In a statement Aviva said it had voluntarily agreed to amend a ""small proportion"" of leases it had acquired with terms which cause rents to double every 10 or 15 years. The agreement affected about 1,000 leases or just over 2% of those held by the fund. The CMA's George Lusty told the BBC: ""If Aviva is now the freeholder for your property and your lease contains a term that doubles the ground rent every ten or 15 years, that doubling won't apply, so you'll just pay the initial ground rent that you signed up to at the beginning and if you've already started to pay an increased fee, they'll refund that."" Jo Darbyshire, a co-founder of the National Leasehold Campaign, originally had a ground rent that doubled with developer Taylor Wimpey. She bought the house near Bolton in 2010 for Â£400,000 - and two years after that Taylor Wimpey sold the leasehold to Adriatic Land, now held by a division called Longharbour. ""The price to buy [the freehold] absolutely rocketed from Â£5,000 to Â£50,000 and it has since come down to Â£30,000."" Jo says she used Taylor Wimpey's ground rent assistance scheme which was Â£750 towards expenses and she didn't have to pay to have the lease converted from the one which had doubled to one that converts to rises linked to RPI inflation. She is now planning to speak to her solicitor to work out whether her best option is to try and buy the freehold at the original price or lower. ""It's good that Aviva has set this precedent, but whether or not [the firm that holds my] freehold will join them is another question,"" she adds. Taylor Wimpey said: ""We will continue to engage with the CMA and, as previously announced, we will work with them to find a satisfactory resolution."" Claire Stevens, from Lancaster, bought a Â£190,000 Persimmon property in 2017 and bought the freehold in 2019 for Â£3,750 - which 25 times the ground rent. She said she rang the helpline today to ask if she could expect a refund of Â£1,750 but they didn't know. ""We bought the freehold for house as soon as we could,"" she says. ""I hope that this is a genuine offer, not just a ploy to stop them being investigated further,"" Claire adds. Persimmon Homes has extended its existing Right to Buy scheme to cap the purchase price of a freehold at Â£2,000. It said the extended scheme applied to any leases sold on or after 1 January 2000 and would run until 31 December 2026. It said customers who had already acquired their freeholds from Persimmon under the existing Right to Buy scheme, and who still own the freehold, could apply to be reimbursed for the difference between the price paid and Â£2,000. Persimmon group chief executive Dean Finch said the agreement showed the company's ""determination to operate with integrity"". ""Building on our existing Right to Buy scheme, this agreement provides a fair deal for all leaseholders of Persimmon built houses, extending the opportunity to purchase their freehold at a price well below market value.""

Mr Lusty said both companies were required to keep the CMA informed about the changes they were making. ""We'll absolutely make sure that they stick to that and of course we're prepared to intervene again through court action in necessary to make sure they stick to what they've committed to do."" The National Leasehold Campaign, many of many of whose members gave evidence to the CMA, tweeted that the watchdog had secured ""landmark commitments for leaseholders. Another massive milestone. Persimmon & Aviva have eventually done the right thing at last, now other developers & freeholders MUST FOLLOW."" The CMA launched enforcement action against four housing developers in September 2020. In addition to Persimmon, these were Countryside Properties, Taylor Wimpey and Barrett. It has also been investigating investment firms Aviva, Abacus Land, Adriatic Land and Brigante Properties which bought leasehold contracts from Countryside and or Taylor Wimpey. Investigations are continuing into all of them except Persimmon and Aviva. The watchdog is taking a drip-drip approach in this long-running investigation. They are hoping that getting a few companies to agree to change their ways will pressure others to do the same without the need for costly court cases. It's not an easy task because there are now a lot of players in this market. The big developers began the trick of sneaking high ground rents into contracts, often without flagging it to buyers. But over time some of these lucrative contracts have been sold on to investment companies looking to profit from them. The pension firm Aviva owns just under 10% of those problematic contracts, with charges that double within 15 years. Their change of heart will certainly have a big impact on the 1,000 homeowners who have been paying the exorbitant bills, but it doesn't fix the problem for the other 12,000 households struggling to pay increasing ground rent on top of their mortgages. The government says it planning to ban ground rent from future contracts, but that won't help those who have an existing problem, unless the watchdog does more to force other builders and investment firms to change their contracts too. Mr Lusty said: ""We hope today's announcement will send a clear signal to other housing developers and investors that they need to sort out this really difficult issue for leasehold home owners."" The government, which asked the CMA to carry out the investigation, welcomed the agreement. Housing secretary Robert Jenrick said the settlement with Aviva and Persimmon was a ""hugely important step and demonstrates our commitment to support existing leaseholders who may have been mis-sold properties"". ""We have also introduced new legislation that will protect future homeowners by restricting ground rents in new leases to zero and I would strongly urge other developers to follow suit in amending their historic practices."" Mike Amesbury MP, Labour's shadow housing minister, said the change was welcome but ""further highlights the injustice faced by homeowners already trapped in our feudal leasehold system"". He said: ""The government has long promised reform, but their upcoming bill is a missed opportunity to help existing leaseholders... The Government must go further and faster to help existing leaseholders.""

LiveLiveBoris Johnson faces prime minister's questions2 minutes ago,"Boris Johnson and Keir Starmer clashed over conviction rates for rape and sexual assault The Labour leader asked the PM why conviction rate for rape are falling Boris Johnson says ""too often"" cases are not fit for prosecution and blamed a lack of joined-up thinking in the system UK travel bosses are calling on the government to reopen international travel and expand the number of countries on green list Ministers are expected to update the so-called traffic light list for travel on Thursday The health secretary has said ministers are working on plans to remove quarantine rules for fully vaccinated people arriving from amber countries Five years on from the Brexit referendum, the prime minister has said the historic vote to leave the EU can act as a spur to jobs and renewal across the UK The former Conservative industry secretary, Lord Heseltine,Â has described the government's approach to engaging with businesses as 'chaotic' Emails obtained by the BBC suggest the PM's former aide Dominic Cummings tried to bypass Whitehall practise, to fast track a Â£530,000 grant to an external data team Edited by Johanna Howitt BBC Politics We'll close our coverage now of this week's PMQs.

Our colleagues on theBBC Coronavirus live pagewill bring you full coverage there. Thanks for following along with us here today. Reality Check At Prime Ministerâs
Questions, Boris Johnson said the government had invested âanother Â£85mâ in the
Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) to help improve the record on rape
prosecutions. Thatâs true, but it comes off the back of budget cuts of 25% to
the Ministry of Justice, including the CPS, since 2010-11. CPS staff numbers fell by
2,374 between 2010-11 and 2019-20. In the year to the end of
March 2020, 58,856 cases of rape were recorded by police forces in England and
Wales. In the same year (although
this will not necessarily be the same cases due to the time it takes for them
to move through the criminal justice system) there were just 2,102
prosecutions, compared with 4,536 in 2014-15 â more than halving. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Here's a quick round up of what was said at today's question time: Reality Check Boris Johnson has been talking about the EU Settlement
Scheme that allows EU nationals living in the UK to maintain their rights after
Brexit. âIt has produced 5.6 million applications already and I seem
to remember that we were told there were only 3.2 million or 3 million to begin
with,â he said. He switched between referring to 5.6 million applications
and 5.6 million people. Itâs not the same thing as there are some duplicates. But there have been five million successful applications, which is considerably
more than the estimate for the number of EU nationals living in the UK. The Office for National Statistics is working on new methods
to come up with bettermigration statistics,external. You can read more about ithere. Conservative Theresa Villiers also raises the issue of planning and asks if the PM will reassure residents that they will have a say over what is built in their neighbourhood. The PM says ""yes indeed"". He says he won't have the new Planning Bill ""misrepresented by anybody""  because ministers want to give people the chance of home ownership. He says he wants to ""relieve pressure on the over-heating south east"" and ""build back better across the whole of the UK"". Also by video link, Labour MP Bell Ribeiro-Addy says that scientists have warned that variants of coronavirus could reduce the effectiveness of vaccines. She says that intellectual property laws are slowing down the roll-out of the vaccine globally. Boris Johnson says the G7 have agreed to another billion vaccines on top of the billion already promised. He says vaccines are effective against all variants that ""we can currently see"". Conservative Esther McVey asks the prime minister if the HS2 project will soon no longer become ""value for money"" or whether he will see it through despite the high cost. She says it is a ""white elephant"" and the money would be better spent on delivering high-speed broadband. Boris Johnson says broadband coverage is important, but says he does not agree with her on HS2. Labour MP Janet Daby says yesterday was Windrush Day, ""yet this year it's a reminder of the appalling failure"" of the Windrush Compensation Scheme. She says at least 21 people have died while awaiting payments, and only 687 people have received any compensation at all. Boris Johnson says he accepts ""the injustice that was done to the Windrush Generation"" and he wants to make sure that payments from the scheme are ""accelerated"". He says in the future he wants Windrush to be associated a positive message, of those who came to the UK to work and help the country. Conservative Andrew Mitchell asks about the announcement from the foreign office that Britain is to cut its support for tackling neglected tropical diseases by 95%. He says this means tablets and vaccines will be destroyed as a result so has the PM had a chance to review the decision he asks and will he have a vote in the Commons on cuts to aid spending? Boris Johnson says there will be a debate on overseas aid but he does not accept this view of the country's contribution to the fight of disease around the world. The UK is contributing Â£10bn this year the PM says, in spite of the ""colossal spending"" the government has been forced to make to look after families and support jobs in this country during the pandemic. The SNP's Owen Thompson accuses the government of wanting to ""neuter"" the Electoral Commission, the watchdog that oversees political financing in the UK. It comes after ministers last week announced plans to specify in law that the watchdog should not be able to bring prosecutions - a power it has previously asked for. But Boris Johnson doesn't engage, adding: ""I can say absolutely nothing"". SNP MP Philippa Whitford says that during the Brexit referendum the PM promised there'd be no rights changes for EU citizens in the UK. She says those without settled status in one week won't be able to rent property or access healthcare. She says the UK asked repeatedly for grace periods during Brexit transitions, so she asks why this can't be extended to EU citizens. Boris Johnson says the settled status scheme has been a ""great success"" and has received 5.6m applications so far. He urges any otherEU citizens who want to remain in the UKto fill out the relevant forms in the next week. Joining by video link Labour's Julie Elliott calls on the PM to condemn internet giant Amazon for ""throwing brand new tech into landfill"" - following reports it has destroyed unsold computers. She says this is ""appalling"" and is denying internet to poor children to learn remotely during the pandemic. Boris Johnson says he was ""shocked"" to hear computers were being thrown away, calling it ""bizarre and unacceptable"". He says he is sure the company ""will wish to rectify it as fast as possible"". Conservative Steve Double raises the issue of planning for new homes. He says there is a housing crisis in Cornwall with local people being priced out of the market by inflated prices due to the huge demand for  second homes. Will the  PM ensure planning reforms are not about helping the wealthy but rather to enable locals to get the homes they need, he asks. Johnson says the point has been raised repeatedly with him and he is ""determined"" to address the issue. He says the focus will be on building ""local homes for local people"". Off the back his party'sshock by-election win. Lib Dem Leader Sir Ed Davey says that people in Chesham and Amersham told him how they were worried about holding down a job and caring for family members as a family carer. He says there are ""thousands of people"" like this in every constituency in ""Conservative heartlands"". He asks what the PM will do ""to make these people's lives a little easier"" for those caring for others, unpaid. Boris Johnson says he ""salutes"" family carers. He says the government has looked after these families ""to the best of this country's ability"" and is putting ""unprecedented funds"" into adult social care. SNP Westminster leader, Ian Blackford is up. He asks if the government used an emergency Covid contract, as reported in the Herald newspaper,  to conduct constitutional  campaigning on the union. Mr Johnson says he is not aware of this. But Blackford says during the height of the pandemic emergency contracts were used to conduct political research and will the PM commit to an inquiry? Johnson says he can't think of a better use of public funds than making sure all of the UK fights the pandemic together. For his final question, Keir Starmer says ""criminals are ""getting away with it"" because of ""record low"" rape conviction rates, and ""record high"" backlogs in the court system. Blaming it on a ""decade of Conservative cuts,"" he asks the PM to take ""some responsibility"" and apologise to rape victims. In reply, Boris Johnson says ""of course I say sorry for the trauma they have been through"" due to the ""inadequacies"" of the justice system, which he vows ministers will improve. He says the government is focusing on recovering from the pandemic - goading Labour with the charge that ""they jabber, we jab"". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer says he spent ""five years as Director of Public Prosecutions"" and so he knows the ""impact of cuts"". He says the government can't make cuts to the Crown Prosecution Service and close ""half of courts in England and Wales"" and think that a modest increase in funding will fix problems. He says the government's so-called rape review is ""unambitious"" and does nothing to address the ""epidemic of violence against women and girls"". Boris Johnson says the government has brought in the ""landmark"" violence against women and girls legislation. He says Labour voted against increasing sentences for serious sexual offences. Starmer says the PM's response is ""appalling"". We have ""terrible"" rates of conviction and prosecution for rape he says and victims are being failed so does the PM accept that cuts to the criminal justice system have contributed to this? The PM says ""no"" that is not the case. He says funding has increased and rather it is a lack of joined up thinking in the system that is to blame. He says police numbers are up and more investment is going in. Keir Starmer says Labour declined to support the government's sentencing bill because it did ""more to protect statues than women"". He asks what section of the bill ""will do anything"" to increase the number of reported rapes that result in a charge being brought. He says this is currently not the case in 98.4% of reported rapes. The prime minister points to a section of the bill to get rid of the early release people who have already been convicted of rape at the halfway point in their sentence. He says the government is also investing to ensure there are advisers so that rape victims and survivors ""have people in whom they can confide and trust"". Â© 2025 BBC.

EU citizens given 28-day deadline to apply to stayThe Home Office says people with a reasonable excuse for a delay can complete their forms later.,"Immigration enforcement officials will begin giving EU citizens who live in the UK a 28-day warning to apply to remain, the government says. But the Home Office will allow people indefinite time to complete an application for settled status if they have a reasonable excuse for delay. There is a week to go until the deadline for applications. Some 5.6 millionEuropean Economic Area,external(EEA) citizens and their dependents have applied for settled status. But there are around 400,000 cases outstanding, and the government's helpline is receiving thousands of calls a day. How many more EU nationals are in UK than was thought? Digital border will allow arrivals to be measured Letter sent to Home Office over immigration policy After the 2016 Brexit referendum, which took place precisely five years ago, settled status was introduced for citizens of the EU and EEA living in the UK. It allows them to retain the same rights of residence, travel, employment and access to healthcare and benefits. The countries whose nationals have made the highest numbers of applications are Poland (975,000) and Romania (918,000). Immigration minister Kevin Foster said anyone whose application was not concluded by next week's deadline would not lose out, as their rights were protected in law. He added that immigration enforcement officials would begin issuing 28-day notices to people, advising them to apply for settled status. Migrants' groups had voiced concern that children would be among those who had not applied. But Mr Foster said there would be an indefinite period where people who had not applied would be allowed to do so, if they had reasonable grounds. He gave the example of students who might discover when applying to university for the first time that they do not have settled status. Asked whether the new immigration system had made it difficult to attract EU workers, he said that ""in the first instance"" employers should be looking to recruit from the UK market. ""We're giving people access on a global basis to skills that take time to train, but for jobs that take less time to train for, we do believe it's right we encourage employers to look in the first instance to offer rewarding and good packages to domestic workers,"" he told the BBC. EU nationals living in the UK have until 30 June to apply to stay in the UK. They can apply for: Settled status - on offer to anyone who can prove that they had been in the UK continuously for five years or more before 31 December 2020. As of 31 May, it has been granted to 2.75 million people. Pre-settled status - on offer to anyone who had been in the UK for less than five years by the end of 2020. As of 31 May, it has been granted to 2.28 million. They can apply for settled status in future, but there is no guarantee they will get it. Maike Bohn, co-founder of the EU citizens' campaign group the3million, said: ""It's good that people can apply late, but the crux is they're unlawful as they haven't put an application in. ""Those eligible and not applying on time become unlawful and risk losing work, housing, access to free health care and so much more."" Mr Foster said existing benefit claimants would not have their payments stopped immediately if they had not been granted settled status. But he said no-one could begin a benefit claim, job, or tenancy in England without settled status. He also said the Home Office had ""changed guidance"" to border officials after reports that some EU citizens had been detained for long periods at the border last month. Speaking to the House of Lords European Affairs Committee on Tuesday, he said: ""I want to get as many people through the door before the 30th [of June] as possible."" The EEA is made up of the 27 EU states plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. No-one knows how many EU citizens living in the UK have yet to apply for settled status, allowing them to remain here legally after next week's deadline. The European Union suspects there could be tens of thousands of people, many of them vulnerable, who will not have submitted their application in time. Older people and children in care are of particular concern, and the EU is urging the Home Office to guarantee the rights of late applicants. The UK government says it will take a ""compassionate and flexible"" approach, giving people who have 'reasonable grounds' for missing the deadline, 28 days to apply. No action will be taken against them once an application has been submitted. The EU, however, says Britain's compliant or hostile environment towards migrants gives them cause for concern.

Firms reassured over post-Covid debts,"Kwasi Kwarteng is keen to reassure businesses The government has told business leaders it will take a ""cautious approach"" to firms that owe it money in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. The message came in a letter from Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng to the Institute of Directors and R3, which represents insolvency firms. In the letter,first reported by the Financial Times,external, he said enforcing insolvency would remain a last resort. The government has spent billions protecting the economy from Covid. As part of these efforts, measures preventing firms from being wound up if they fall into insolvency have been extended until the end of September. However, it is feared some companies could struggle to survive when emergency support measures begin to be removed. Government help available to businesses includesloans, tax relief and cash grants,external. However, many firms will have deferred taxes, including VAT, that will start to fall due as the country emerges from the pandemic. Easing delay to have 'critical impact' on business We're in serious trouble, says hospitality sector When company insolvencies involve unpaid VAT and income tax, HMRC has the status of ""preferential creditor"", which means it gets paid first. But business leaders want the government to ensure this is used to help companies restructure, rather than to shut them down. In the letter, seen by BBC News, the business secretary writes that he ""recognises the path back to full trading and coming off government support will be difficult for many companies"". In response to concerns about firms becoming insolvent because of money owed to the Treasury through loans and support schemes, Mr Kwarteng says HMRC will take a ""cautious approach to enforcement of debt owed to government"" which has been accrued during the pandemic, ""including from the number of loans and support schemes given"". ""It is right that where government has stepped up, through the general taxpayer, to support the economy during this national emergency, that business should do all it can to pay its fair share of taxes and repay back loans where it can,"" he says. He adds that it will be flexible with companies who engage with it in order to manage their debt. There is pressure on the government to recoup some of the vast amounts spent supporting the economy during the pandemic - and Mr Kwarteng writes that a return to normal insolvency processes will be vital for a healthy economy.

Giant panda gives birth to twins at Japanese zoo,"This video can not be played Watch the moment giant panda, Shin Shin, gives birth to the twins at Tokyo's Ueno Zoo A giant panda has given birth to twin cubs at a Japanese zoo. Shin Shin gave birth to the cubs on Wednesday, Tokyo's Ueno Zoo announced. It is the first panda birth there in four years. The sex of the cubs has not yet been revealed. Giant pandas are notoriously difficult to breed in both the wild and in captivity. Only a few thousand of them remain, with conservationists classifying them as vulnerable. Ueno Zoo director Yutaka Fukuda said it was the first time panda twins had been born there. ""When I heard the news that the second baby was born, I couldn't help but whoop,"" he told reporters. Pandas leave Canada for the bamboo plants of China Endangered red panda cub born as zoo reopened Giant pandas rarely take care of two cubs at the same time, so the zoo has decided to put one of the animals into an incubator. ""We will be making sure the mother panda will breastfeed one while we keep the other in the incubator,"" a spokesperson for the zoo, Naoya Ohashi, said.

'He should've got 10 years for every life he took',"Three people died in the crash - mother and son Mary and Kevin Faxton, and 24-year-old Bryan Magill Leap Year Day 2020 - in the early hours of the morning a fatal crash occurs near Junction 20 of the N1, the border stretch of the main Belfast to Dublin road. Three people died in the two-vehicle crash - mother and son Mary, 82, and 58-year-old Kevin Faxton, from Bessbrook in County Armagh, and 25-year-old Bryan Magill, from Newry. The man responsible was 20-year-old Keith Lennon from Dromintee in County Armagh. A short time before the crash he had recorded and shared a social media video of himself driving at 140mph (225km/h). The car he was driving had no MoT, no insurance and had three defective tyres. After driving into the back of the Faxtons' car, Lennon fled the scene on foot leaving Bryan Magill, who he had met for the first time that evening, dying in the back seat of his car. In 2020 more than 200 people lost their lives on roads in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Each death a passing news story, sympathies offered to the families and the world moves on. Keith Lennon is appealing his nine-year jail sentence and 20-year driving ban But for many of those families, there is no moving on. Yvonne Campbell's mother and brother died in the crash. ""Around about half-six in the morning my brother Malcolm rang and said Daddy was very distressed,"" she said. ""Mummy and Kevin went out for a spin and hadn't come home. So of course we all arrived over at Daddy's - he only lives a minute away. ""We knew there was something wrong. We rang their mobiles. Yvonne Campbell says her father ""couldn't live without"" his wife and son ""At around eight, my brother-in-law rang to say there had been a bad accident up by the Carrickdale and we just sort of knew then. ""Daddy's health just deteriorated. He just couldn't live without them. It just broke his heart every day. He cried every day. ""It's just sad that in the last year of his lifeâ¦ he's only dead six or seven weeks now. He just wanted to be with them."" This video can not be played ""He should have got 10 years for every life"" Francis Harte, the partner of Bryan Magill's mother Yvonne Magee, also recalls the horror of the morning of the crash. ""I made a phone call to Drogheda hospital and got speaking to a garda (Irish police officer). ""I had the phone on speaker. The whole house was full of the family. The brothers, sisters, mum and dad. ""Basically we got a live commentary of Bryan in the morgue and him getting identified. Francis Harte says the family did not know what to do when they were told about Bryan's death ""The garda started describing Bryan's features - his clothes, his hair. ""Every sentence that he uttered we knew and then he said they found a bank card in his pocket and after that it was bedlam. Nobody knew what to do."" Lennon handed himself into police in Dundalk the following day. In December 2020 he pleaded guilty to three counts of manslaughter and in February 2021 he was sentenced to nine years in prison with another 12 months suspended. He also received a 20-year driving ban. Sentencing for serious crime remains a difficult process, both for the courts and for victims. In handing down her sentence, the judge said this was one of the worst cases she had ever heard. Despite that, the families were disappointed with the sentence handed down. The crash happened on the N1 at Carrickcarnan in the early hours of 29 February 2020 ""There is no sentence ever going to bring them back,"" said Yvonne Campbell. ""But I honestly believe that he should have got 10 years for every life that he took."" Francis Harte feels the same. ""She did hand down a 20-year driving ban but people like that should not be able to get on the road again ever,"" he said. The Republic of Ireland's court service has confirmed Lennon is appealing his sentence. No date has been set for that hearing.

Millions become millionaires during Covid pandemic,"Rises in house prices were a big factor in people's wealth increases More than five million people became millionaires across the world in 2020 despite economic damage from the Covid-19 pandemic. While many poor people became poorer, the number of millionaires increased by 5.2 million to 56.1 million globally, Credit Suisse research found. In 2020, more than 1% of adults worldwide were millionaires for the first time. Recovering stock markets and soaring house prices helped boost their wealth. Wealth creation appeared to be ""completely detached"" from the economic woes of the pandemic, the researchers said. Lower interest rates and government support programmes had led to ""a huge transfer"" of wealth from the public sector to the household sector, they added. This had prompted a surge in household saving, which had ""inflated household financial assets and caused household debts to be lower than they would be otherwise"". The number of ultra-high net worth individuals, usually defined as those having investable assets of more than $30m, grew by 24% worldwide in 2020, the fastest rate of increase since 2003. Credit Suisse said its total of the number of millionaires might be higher than other organisations' estimates because it included both investable and non-investable assets, such as owner-occupied homes. Anthony Shorrocks, economist and author of theGlobal Wealth Report,external, said the pandemic had an ""acute short-term impact on global markets"", but added this was ""largely reversed by the end of June 2020"". ""Global wealth not only held steady in the face of such turmoil, but in fact rapidly increased in the second half of the year,"" he said. Billionaires see fortunes rise by 27% during the pandemic 'Wealth increase of 10 men during pandemic could buy vaccines for all' However, wealth differences between adults widened in 2020, and Mr Shorrocks said if asset price increases, such as house price rises, were removed from the analysis, ""then global household wealth may well have fallen"". ""In the lower wealth bands where financial assets are less prevalent, wealth has tended to stand still, or, in many cases, regressed,"" he said. ""Some of the underlying factors may self correct over time. For example, interest rates will begin to rise again at some point, and this will dampen asset prices."" Total global wealth grew by 7.4%, the report said. Since the start of the 21st Century, the number of people with wealth between $10,000 and $100,000 had more than tripled in size from 507 million in 2000 to 1.7 billion in mid-2020. They said the increase reflected the ""growing prosperity of emerging economies, especially China, and the expansion of the middle class in the developing world"". Nannette Hechler-Fayd'herbe, chief investment officer at Credit Suisse, said: ""There is no denying actions taken by governments and central banks to organise massive income transfer programmes to support the individuals and businesses most adversely affected by the pandemic, and by lowering interest rates, have successfully averted a full scale global crisis."" She added: ""The lowering of interest rates by central banks has probably had the greatest impact. ""It is a major reason why share prices and house prices have flourished, and these translate directly into our valuations of household wealth."" But she added that these interventions ""have come at a great cost"". ""Public debt relative to GDP has risen throughout the world by 20 percentage points or more in many countries. ""Generous payments from the public sector to households have meant that disposable household income has been relatively stable and has even risen in some countries."" Ms Hechler-Fayd'herbe said a ""major reason"" why share prices and house prices had ""flourished"" was due to the lowering of interest rates by banks, which, she added, translated ""directly into our valuations of household wealth"".

Leasehold firms agree changes after investigation,"Two big players in the leasehold sector have agreed to change the way they operate, following an investigation by the competition watchdog. Housebuilder Persimmon will allow its leaseholders to buy the freehold of their property at a discount. Insurance company Aviva, which buys leaseholds from house builders, will repay homeowners who saw their ground rents double. Campaigners for leaseholders said the commitments were a ""massive milestone"". The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) launched its investigation into leaseholds in 2019 because it was worried that leaseholders were facing huge and unexpected increases in the cost of buying a freehold or massive increases in ground rents. It said the said the commitments by Persimmon and Aviva were a ""real win"". CMA chief executive Andrea Coscelli said the watchdog now expected other housing developers and investors to take similar action. ""This is a real win for thousands of leaseholders - for too long people have found themselves trapped in homes they can struggle to sell or been faced with unexpectedly high prices to buy their freehold. ""But our work isn't done. We now expect other housing developers and investors to follow the lead of Aviva and Persimmon. If not, they can expect to face legal action."" With a leasehold, the person owns a lease which gives them the right to use the property. But they still have to get their landlord's permission for any work or changes to their homes. When a leasehold flat or house is first sold, a lease is granted for a fixed period of time, typically between 99 and 125 years, but sometimes up to 999 years - although people may extend their lease or buy the freehold. But leasehold house owners are often charged expensive ground rent as well as fees if they want to make changes to their homes. A leasehold house can also be difficult to sell. Under the new commitments Aviva will remove ground rent terms the CMA considers unfair and repay homeowners who saw rents doubled. In a statement Aviva said it had voluntarily agreed to amend a ""small proportion"" of leases it had acquired with terms which cause rents to double every 10 or 15 years. The agreement affected about 1,000 leases or just over 2% of those held by the fund. The CMA's George Lusty told the BBC: ""If Aviva is now the freeholder for your property and your lease contains a term that doubles the ground rent every ten or 15 years, that doubling won't apply, so you'll just pay the initial ground rent that you signed up to at the beginning and if you've already started to pay an increased fee, they'll refund that."" Jo Darbyshire, a co-founder of the National Leasehold Campaign, originally had a ground rent that doubled with developer Taylor Wimpey. She bought the house near Bolton in 2010 for Â£400,000 - and two years after that Taylor Wimpey sold the leasehold to Adriatic Land, now held by a division called Longharbour. ""The price to buy [the freehold] absolutely rocketed from Â£5,000 to Â£50,000 and it has since come down to Â£30,000."" Jo says she used Taylor Wimpey's ground rent assistance scheme which was Â£750 towards expenses and she didn't have to pay to have the lease converted from the one which had doubled to one that converts to rises linked to RPI inflation. She is now planning to speak to her solicitor to work out whether her best option is to try and buy the freehold at the original price or lower. ""It's good that Aviva has set this precedent, but whether or not [the firm that holds my] freehold will join them is another question,"" she adds. Taylor Wimpey said: ""We will continue to engage with the CMA and, as previously announced, we will work with them to find a satisfactory resolution."" Claire Stevens, from Lancaster, bought a Â£190,000 Persimmon property in 2017 and bought the freehold in 2019 for Â£3,750 - which 25 times the ground rent. She said she rang the helpline today to ask if she could expect a refund of Â£1,750 but they didn't know. ""We bought the freehold for house as soon as we could,"" she says. ""I hope that this is a genuine offer, not just a ploy to stop them being investigated further,"" Claire adds. Persimmon Homes has extended its existing Right to Buy scheme to cap the purchase price of a freehold at Â£2,000. It said the extended scheme applied to any leases sold on or after 1 January 2000 and would run until 31 December 2026. It said customers who had already acquired their freeholds from Persimmon under the existing Right to Buy scheme, and who still own the freehold, could apply to be reimbursed for the difference between the price paid and Â£2,000. Persimmon group chief executive Dean Finch said the agreement showed the company's ""determination to operate with integrity"". ""Building on our existing Right to Buy scheme, this agreement provides a fair deal for all leaseholders of Persimmon built houses, extending the opportunity to purchase their freehold at a price well below market value.""

Mr Lusty said both companies were required to keep the CMA informed about the changes they were making. ""We'll absolutely make sure that they stick to that and of course we're prepared to intervene again through court action in necessary to make sure they stick to what they've committed to do."" The National Leasehold Campaign, many of many of whose members gave evidence to the CMA, tweeted that the watchdog had secured ""landmark commitments for leaseholders. Another massive milestone. Persimmon & Aviva have eventually done the right thing at last, now other developers & freeholders MUST FOLLOW."" The CMA launched enforcement action against four housing developers in September 2020. In addition to Persimmon, these were Countryside Properties, Taylor Wimpey and Barrett. It has also been investigating investment firms Aviva, Abacus Land, Adriatic Land and Brigante Properties which bought leasehold contracts from Countryside and or Taylor Wimpey. Investigations are continuing into all of them except Persimmon and Aviva. The watchdog is taking a drip-drip approach in this long-running investigation. They are hoping that getting a few companies to agree to change their ways will pressure others to do the same without the need for costly court cases. It's not an easy task because there are now a lot of players in this market. The big developers began the trick of sneaking high ground rents into contracts, often without flagging it to buyers. But over time some of these lucrative contracts have been sold on to investment companies looking to profit from them. The pension firm Aviva owns just under 10% of those problematic contracts, with charges that double within 15 years. Their change of heart will certainly have a big impact on the 1,000 homeowners who have been paying the exorbitant bills, but it doesn't fix the problem for the other 12,000 households struggling to pay increasing ground rent on top of their mortgages. The government says it planning to ban ground rent from future contracts, but that won't help those who have an existing problem, unless the watchdog does more to force other builders and investment firms to change their contracts too. Mr Lusty said: ""We hope today's announcement will send a clear signal to other housing developers and investors that they need to sort out this really difficult issue for leasehold home owners."" The government, which asked the CMA to carry out the investigation, welcomed the agreement. Housing secretary Robert Jenrick said the settlement with Aviva and Persimmon was a ""hugely important step and demonstrates our commitment to support existing leaseholders who may have been mis-sold properties"". ""We have also introduced new legislation that will protect future homeowners by restricting ground rents in new leases to zero and I would strongly urge other developers to follow suit in amending their historic practices."" Mike Amesbury MP, Labour's shadow housing minister, said the change was welcome but ""further highlights the injustice faced by homeowners already trapped in our feudal leasehold system"". He said: ""The government has long promised reform, but their upcoming bill is a missed opportunity to help existing leaseholders... The Government must go further and faster to help existing leaseholders.""

New Alan Turing Â£50 note enters circulation,"The new design has a series of security features The Bank of England's newly-designed Â£50 note featuring the portrait of Alan Turing has entered circulation. The release date coincides with what would have been the computer pioneer and wartime codebreaker's birthday. It means the Bank's entire collection of currently-printed banknotes is made of plastic for the first time. Paper Â£50 and Â£20 notes will no longer be accepted in shops from October next year, although post offices will still accept them. The Bank of England's own counter can alsoswap any old notes,externalfor their face value. This video can not be played Alan Turing Â£50 banknote being printed The BBC was given rare access to the De La Rue banknote printing plant in Essex, where the new Bank of England note is being produced. As many as five million new banknotes can be produced in a day, with 1.3 billion rolling off the machines in a year. Various currencies are produced at the site and the notes are sent to countries around the world. Despite cash use falling for purchases,particularly during the pandemic, there is still a growing demand for banknotes. Population growth and hoarding are among the reasons for the rising requirement. Bank of England chief cashier Sarah John's signature is on the note The Â£50 note is the least frequently used of the Bank's collection. Its future has been called into question in the past, with one review describing it as the ""currency of corrupt elites, of crime of all sorts and of tax evasion"". However, there have still been 357 million of them in circulation this year - the equivalent of one in 13 banknotes. ""They are used more often than people realise,"" said the Bank of England's chief cashier, Sarah John, whose signature is on the note. ""A lot of tourist spending is dependent on Â£50 banknotes. They are also used as a store of value."" The old, paper Â£50 banknotes - first issued in 2011 - are no longer being produced, and will be withdrawn by the end of September next year. They feature steam engine pioneers James Watt and Matthew Boulton. Paper Â£20 notes, featuring the portrait of economist Adam Smith, will also be withdrawn at the same time. The replacement polymer version, which shows artist JMW Turner, went into circulation in February last year. The polymer versions should last two-and-a-half times longer than their predecessors, are harder to forge, and should also survive a spin in the wash. Ruth Euling, managing director of De La Rue Currency, says cash is evolving There have been some concerns raised about plastic banknotes, from thetraces of animal productsused in their production, to anecdotal worries about the notes sticking in wallets and purses. Ruth Euling. managing director of De La Rue Currency, said it was ""more challenging"" to produce polymer notes, but it made financial sense. ""Making cash more efficient is also an important part of keeping cash alive,"" she said. Although very few ATMs issue Â£50 notes, various High Street banks are issuing the new banknote from their counters from Wednesday. 1912 â 1954 1912Alan Mathison Turing was born in West London 1936Produced âOn Computable Numbersâ, aged 24 1952Convicted of gross indecency for his relationship with a man 2013Received royal pardon for the conviction The note features and celebrates the work of Alan Turing, educated in Sherborne, Dorset, who helped accelerate Allied efforts to read German Naval messages enciphered with the Enigma machine, and so shortening World War Two and saving lives. He was also pivotal in the development of early computers, first at the National Physical Laboratory and later at the University of Manchester. What Turing Â£50 notes mean to the LGBT community Is Turing the father of computing? The choice to place him on the note is also designed to promote diversity. The Bank is flying the Progress Pride flag above its building in London's Threadneedle Street on Wednesday to recognise improvements since his appalling treatment by the state for being gay. In 2013, he was given a posthumous royal pardon for his 1952 conviction for gross indecency. New Alan Turing artwork in the centre of GCHQ headquarters He had been arrested after having an affair with a 19-year-old Manchester man, and was forced to take female hormones as an alternative to prison. He died at the age of 41. An inquest recorded his death as suicide. In keeping with his work, the new note includes security features, similar to other notes, such as holograms, see-through windows - based partly on images of the wartime codebreaking centre at Bletchley Park - and foil patches. The UK's intelligence agency GCHQ has also unveiled an artwork of Alan Turing's portrait inside the wheels of the codebreaking British Bombe machine, placed in the middle of its headquarters to celebrate his legacy, Jeremy Fleming, GCHQ director, said: ""Alan Turing was a genius who helped to shorten the war and influence the technology that still shapes our lives today.""

Trust in news has grown in UK during pandemic,"Leading politicians and scientific advisors have regularly faced questions from the media throughout the coronavirus pandemic Trust in news coverage has grown in the UK with the public appetite for reliable reporting increasing during the pandemic, research suggests. The Reuters Institute Digital News Report, conducted in January this year, found 44% of people in the UK ""trust most news most of the time"". That figure is up on the previous year 2020, before the pandemic began. But it is still 14 percentage points down on where it was prior to the Brexit vote in 2016. The report found strictly regulated impartial broadcasters such as BBC, ITV, Sky News, and Channel 4 remained the most trusted, followed by national broadsheet newspapers. It also showed trust in particular brands often split along both political and/or generational lines. ""We also find that political partisans from both sides feel that UK media coverage has been unfair to them,"" the report said. The UK was just one of 46 media markets around the world that were surveyed on the topic of trustworthiness. About 92,000 people were involved, including more than 2,000 in the UK. Many young people - especially young women - it suggested, felt that media coverage was less fair to them than it is to other groups. In the US, three-quarters of those who self-identified as being on the right, politically-speaking, felt that media coverage of their views was unfair, compared with just a third of those on the left. Donald Trump supporters protesting outside the White House in January grabbed the headlines Black and Hispanic Americans are also more likely to say media coverage is unfair. Finland remained the country with the highest levels of overall trust (65%) in news content, whereas the USA had the lowest levels (29%), the survey found. Trust in news across all countries grew by an average of six percentage points in the wake of the pandemic, with 44% saying they trust most news most of the time. The growth of social media over the past decade, the report suggested, has encouraged the growth of news sites and channels with overtly partisan lines. However, people on the whole still strongly support the ideals of impartial and objective news. Lead author of the report, Nic Newman, said: ""The focus on factual reporting during the Covid-19 crisis may have made the news seem more straightforward, while the story has also had the effect of squeezing out more partisan political news. ""This may be a temporary effect, but in almost all countries we see audiences placing a greater premium on accurate and reliable news sources."" Print publications have been badly affected by Covid-19 Print publications, the study showed, have been badly affected by Covid-19, due to restrictions on movement affecting sales. Subscriptions or one-off payments to digital news publications were up by two points in the last year - with countries like the USA, Finland and Australia relying more on online news. However, in the UK it remains a minority activity, with just 8% of people saying they currently pay for any online news. Although many people appear to have engaged with news over the past 12 months, researchers also found signs that some are avoiding news altogether. For instance, the study found interest in news had fallen in the United States following the election of President Joe Biden - especially with right-leaning groups. Worries about misinformation remained high, with 58% of those asked expressing concern about what is true or false on the internet when it comes to news. More respondents said they had seen greater misinformation about coronavirus than any other subject, including politics. TikTok has become an increasingly popular source of news for young people A quarter of people overall said they preferred to start their news journeys via a website or app. Those aged 18-24 (known as Generation Z) were found to have weak links with traditional news sites and were almost twice as likely to prefer accessing news via social media, aggregators, or mobile alerts. Platforms like WhatsApp, Instagram, Telegram and TikTok have continued to attract more young people, with many sharing stories about coronavirus and Black Lives Matter on the latter over the past year. That particular network has also been central to a wave of protests by younger people across the world, in countries like Indonesia, Peru and Thailand. Influencers, the report established, play a much bigger role in news on TikTok, Snapchat and Instagram than they do in more ""traditional"" networks like Facebook and Twitter. Co-author of the report, Simge Andi, said: ""The lack of strong journalistic presence could make those relying on these networks particularly vulnerable to misinformation.

"Festivals are facing devastation, MPs warn","Download Festival was run as a limited-capacity pilot event last weekend Festivals and freelancers in the cultural sector face ""devastating consequences"" unless the government offers more support, MPs have warned. The Public Accounts Committee praised a government scheme to bail out cultural institutions, but said festivals faced a ""survival threat"" unless ministers set up a cancellation insurance scheme. It noted the government had not yet modelled how such a scheme could work. The government said more help was coming via its culture recovery fund. The development came asOxford's Truck festival became the latest event to cancel for 2021. ""Without the necessary assurances and guidance from the government, it's become too risky for us to put the event on,"" organisers said in a statement. Festivals 2021: Which ones are still going ahead? Festivals face 'lost summer' without safety net In its report published on Wednesday, the Public Accounts Committee also raised concerns over the lack of support for crew and technicians. It said freelancers who were crucial to running live events had missed out on government funds, despite their income streams drying up as a result of Covid-related cancellations. Speaking in Parliament on Tuesday, the under-secretary of state for culture, Nigel Huddleston MP, said the government was ""aware of wider concerns about the industry, including insurance"". ""We are considering options, and we are taking those issues very seriously,"" he added. This video can not be played Mosh pits and no masks at Download Festival pilot The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) established its culture recovery fund last July, which has allocated Â£1.57bn to help arts organisations recover from the pandemic. Thousands of organisations have been awarded grants and loans under the scheme, including Shakespeare's Globe, the Royal Albert Hall, the Cavern Club, Glastonbury and Canterbury Cathedral. Festivals received more than Â£34m of the total. However, by February 2021, only Â£830m of the funds had been allocated, with Â£495m paid out to recipients. The Public Accounts Committee's report on the fund, highlighted that some organisations found it difficult to apply for funds, while many unsuccessful applicants received no feedback, ""leaving them in perilous financial situations"". Even when awards were granted, it said, the money was not distributed as quickly as the DCMS had intended. Last week, Toni Coe-Brooker, who runs the Green Door Store nightclub in Brighton, told the BBC she was ""still waiting"" for her final payment from the first round of grants, which was due at the start of 2021. Matthew Otridge from the Music Venues Trust said the situation was not unique. The Royal Albert Hall said emergency funding, while welcome, had come with some disadvantages ""Venues who were successful with funding are, in many cases, still waiting for that money to come - including money that was meant for the April to June period,"" he said. With lockdown extended for another four weeks, many owners will have ""serious concerns with cash flow"", he added. UK Music, the industry body which gave written evidence to the committee, said fewer than 10% of festival organisers applied to the fund. It told MPs: ""Certain types of businesses also seem to have struggled to apply for support. We are looking to work with stakeholders to understand why more did not apply."" Even venues who secured funding on time faced problems. The Royal Albert Hall, which received a Â£20.74m repayable loan, said it had subsequently struggled to raise money from other sources, ""because many potential supporters assumed... we had seen a large portion of the Â£1.57bn from government"". In written evidence to the Public Accounts Committee, the venue added that taking on such a large loan ""has long term implications for our ability to invest in our Grade I listed building, and our artistic activities"". The Public Accounts Committee acknowledged the DCMS's ""efforts to help cultural bodies survive"" and recognised its ""achievement"" in establishing the scheme so quickly, while making recommendations for the future of the fund. It asked minsters to explain how Arts Council England, which oversees the fund, would manage the repayment of Â£252m in loans over the next 20 years. It also asked how they would help freelancers and festivals who, it said, ""were under-represented in terms of the funding they received"". Peter Gabriel (inset) said next month's Womad festival was under threat In particular, it said ""Britain's treasured summer festivals"" could be wiped out ""without a government-backed insurance indemnity package against the risk of cancellation"". Festivals including Nozstock and Boomtown have blamed the lack of insurance for their inability to go ahead this summer, while Peter Gabriel has warned the situationcould jeopardise next month's Womad festival. MPs on the DCMS Select Committeecalled on the government to establish such a schemein May. ""The pandemic has exposed just how poorly departments across government understand the sectors that they oversee,"" said Meg Hillier MP, Chair of the Public Accounts Committee. ""DCMS was clear that it 'would not save every organisation' but we are concerned about the impact of Covid-19 on those organisations vital to the culture sector - sound engineers, lighting and technical support. ""The government must urgently consider support other than cash, such as insurance indemnity, or parts of the sector risk a second summer of forced inactivity with all the devastating consequences to their survival,"" the Labour MP added. ""This is a sector famed for making the show go on, no matter what, but it has been hammered by Covid-19. If the pandemic is allowed to steal a significant part of our creative and cultural sector it will have impoverished us indeed."" A spokeswoman for the DCMS said officials were working ""flat out"" to help live events restart. It said the culture recovery fund has ""already ensured the survival of more than 5,000 organisations... protected tens of thousands of jobs and helped create work for almost a hundred thousand freelancers"". ""We're pleased this report recognises DCMS' achievement in delivering this record investment quickly and accurately,"" she added. ""More help is on the way following a Â£300m boost to the culture recovery fund at the Budget and we continue to explore what further support, including issues around securing insurance, may be required when the culture sector is able to reopen.""

Wall Street giant to bar unvaccinated staff,"JP Morgan will instruct US staff to register their vaccine status on an internal web portal this week. Employees who have had both vaccine doses will be allowed to discard face masks at work. Staff may be allowed to tick a box saying they would rather not disclose their status - although the bank hopes only a small number will do so. The move is intended to reassure workers that returning to the office is safe. Jamie Dimon, the boss of America's biggest bank, recently said he wanted US staff back in the office from July. It will also help the bank plan what sort of social distancing regime will be required as all workers will be asked to return for at least some of the week after the 4 July holiday. The letter will not be going to employees in the UK and Europe as the company says data privacy laws here effectively prevent most employers asking questions about medical status. JP Morgan's London offices are currently operating at around 25% occupancy but that is expected to increase after 19 July. Chief executive of JP Morgan, Jamie Dimon, recently said he wants US staff back in the office from July The move by JP Morgan follows that of rival Morgan Stanley who went further by barring staff and clients from entering its New York offices if they are not fully vaccinated. The policy comes into effect next month, in a move aimed at allowing the lifting of other Covid-related rules. An internal memo,first reported by the Financial Times,external, said: ""Starting July 12 all employees, contingent workforce, clients and visitors will be required to attest to being fully vaccinated to access Morgan Stanley buildings in New York City and Westchester."" Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs bankers were instructed to report their vaccine status ahead of returning to their desks earlier this month. While a Goldman Sachs memo seen by the BBC strongly encouraged staff to get vaccinated, it stopped short of telling them they must have the jab: ""We understand that the choice to get vaccinated is a personal one."" 'If you can eat out, you can go to the office' Goldman bankers ordered to disclose vaccine status Working from home - can I keep doing it? Last week, the UK government also announced that Covid vaccinations are to become compulsory for staff at care homes in England. Health Secretary Mr Hancock said it was a ""sensible and reasonable step"" and he would consult on extending it to the NHS. Employment lawyers at Pinsent Masons told the BBC that making vaccination mandatory could be regarded as a ""reasonable instruction"" in a social care setting because refusal could put vulnerable people at risk. ""Employers in other sectors arguably do not have the same strong rationale for instructing staff to take the vaccine - for example, professional services, where it has been shown that work can be done effectively from home,"" they said. But they also concede that treating people differently based on their vaccine status could potentially lead to charges of discrimination. Employment law looks set to be tested in the weeks and months ahead. The BBC has also learnt that the chief executive of JP Morgan, Jamie Dimon, will not be visiting London on an upcoming trip to Europe because of UK quarantine restrictions. He will be attending an event for international business leaders called ""Choose France"" hosted by President Emmanuel Macron at the Palace of Versailles. France has no quarantine requirements for US travellers who are fully-vaccinated.

"New Alan Turing Â£50 note enters circulationThe old Â£50 and Â£20 banknotes will be withdrawn by October next year, the Bank of England says.Business","The new design has a series of security features The Bank of England's newly-designed Â£50 note featuring the portrait of Alan Turing has entered circulation. The release date coincides with what would have been the computer pioneer and wartime codebreaker's birthday. It means the Bank's entire collection of currently-printed banknotes is made of plastic for the first time. Paper Â£50 and Â£20 notes will no longer be accepted in shops from October next year, although post offices will still accept them. The Bank of England's own counter can alsoswap any old notes,externalfor their face value. This video can not be played Alan Turing Â£50 banknote being printed The BBC was given rare access to the De La Rue banknote printing plant in Essex, where the new Bank of England note is being produced. As many as five million new banknotes can be produced in a day, with 1.3 billion rolling off the machines in a year. Various currencies are produced at the site and the notes are sent to countries around the world. Despite cash use falling for purchases,particularly during the pandemic, there is still a growing demand for banknotes. Population growth and hoarding are among the reasons for the rising requirement. Bank of England chief cashier Sarah John's signature is on the note The Â£50 note is the least frequently used of the Bank's collection. Its future has been called into question in the past, with one review describing it as the ""currency of corrupt elites, of crime of all sorts and of tax evasion"". However, there have still been 357 million of them in circulation this year - the equivalent of one in 13 banknotes. ""They are used more often than people realise,"" said the Bank of England's chief cashier, Sarah John, whose signature is on the note. ""A lot of tourist spending is dependent on Â£50 banknotes. They are also used as a store of value."" The old, paper Â£50 banknotes - first issued in 2011 - are no longer being produced, and will be withdrawn by the end of September next year. They feature steam engine pioneers James Watt and Matthew Boulton. Paper Â£20 notes, featuring the portrait of economist Adam Smith, will also be withdrawn at the same time. The replacement polymer version, which shows artist JMW Turner, went into circulation in February last year. The polymer versions should last two-and-a-half times longer than their predecessors, are harder to forge, and should also survive a spin in the wash. Ruth Euling, managing director of De La Rue Currency, says cash is evolving There have been some concerns raised about plastic banknotes, from thetraces of animal productsused in their production, to anecdotal worries about the notes sticking in wallets and purses. Ruth Euling. managing director of De La Rue Currency, said it was ""more challenging"" to produce polymer notes, but it made financial sense. ""Making cash more efficient is also an important part of keeping cash alive,"" she said. Although very few ATMs issue Â£50 notes, various High Street banks are issuing the new banknote from their counters from Wednesday. 1912 â 1954 1912Alan Mathison Turing was born in West London 1936Produced âOn Computable Numbersâ, aged 24 1952Convicted of gross indecency for his relationship with a man 2013Received royal pardon for the conviction The note features and celebrates the work of Alan Turing, educated in Sherborne, Dorset, who helped accelerate Allied efforts to read German Naval messages enciphered with the Enigma machine, and so shortening World War Two and saving lives. He was also pivotal in the development of early computers, first at the National Physical Laboratory and later at the University of Manchester. What Turing Â£50 notes mean to the LGBT community Is Turing the father of computing? The choice to place him on the note is also designed to promote diversity. The Bank is flying the Progress Pride flag above its building in London's Threadneedle Street on Wednesday to recognise improvements since his appalling treatment by the state for being gay. In 2013, he was given a posthumous royal pardon for his 1952 conviction for gross indecency. New Alan Turing artwork in the centre of GCHQ headquarters He had been arrested after having an affair with a 19-year-old Manchester man, and was forced to take female hormones as an alternative to prison. He died at the age of 41. An inquest recorded his death as suicide. In keeping with his work, the new note includes security features, similar to other notes, such as holograms, see-through windows - based partly on images of the wartime codebreaking centre at Bletchley Park - and foil patches. The UK's intelligence agency GCHQ has also unveiled an artwork of Alan Turing's portrait inside the wheels of the codebreaking British Bombe machine, placed in the middle of its headquarters to celebrate his legacy, Jeremy Fleming, GCHQ director, said: ""Alan Turing was a genius who helped to shorten the war and influence the technology that still shapes our lives today.""

People left 'isolated' without bus services,"People in many areas are feeling the consequences of route closures For many people in Wales, living without a bus service means being marooned in their homes, unable to carry out even essential tasks. Marion Hobbs, who lives in Blaencaerau near Maesteg, has to spend Â£8 on taxis each time she goes food shopping, sees the doctor or simply visits friends. Her nearby bus service stopped due to the Covid pandemic and has not resumed. Now politicians want a timescale from the Welsh government on its promise to improve services. Members across all parties in the Senedd pressed for more detail in a debate on Wednesday afternoon. That cannot come soon enough for those living on the Blaencaerau estate, like Marion and her friend Keith Simon, who said they have been left ""stuck"" in their homes and feeling isolated without a bus service. ""I was on it [the service] six days a week"" said Keith. ""It was always half to three-quarters full. It was like a social gathering. ""We'd see different people... you were like a family on the bus,"" agreed Marion. Keith Simon and Marion Hobbs say many people are ""stuck"" at home without a bus service Councillor Paul Davies said he received complaints every day over the absence of the service. ""Older residents with mobility issues have got to walk up from the square with shopping, it's impossible,"" he said. ""It's one of the most deprived wards in Wales and now the last bus they had - the last thing they had - has been taken away."" Why did we shun electric buses 50 years ago? All new road building projects to be frozen Pandemic causes 'marginal' delay to Â£750m Metro The operator, First Cymru, said the service had been ""problematic"" before the pandemic due to low passenger numbers and vehicles being damaged because of ""inconsiderate parking"". However, it said it was working with the council to find a solution. The area's Member of the Senedd (MS), Huw Irranca-Davies, said bus travel was the only public transport option for most people in Ogmore, ""three-quarters"" of which has no rail line. He has triggered a Senedd debate calling on the Welsh government to ""turbo boost"" its proposals to change the regulation of bus services across Wales. The Welsh government has promised legislation to unpick reforms introduced in the 1980s which privatised bus provision outside of London and removed the ability of local authorities to run their own services. Since then, many of the less profitable routes have lost their services. ""I want to see a fast timescale to get on with this and give control back to people over their bus services,"" said Mr Irranca-Davies. Opening his debate in the Senedd chamber, he said new powers the Welsh Parliament now has should be used to put a ""modern Welsh form of re-regulation of buses and public transport in place"". ""Buses and public transport have a fundamental social and public purpose,"" he said. Huw Irranca-Davies is pressing the Welsh government to speed up its Bus Plan Improving access to public transport is a key part of the Welsh government's plan to tackle climate change and aims to produce a plan to look at all aspects for bus service provision by the end of the year. Conservative Senedd transport spokeswoman Natasha Asghar told the Senedd more investment in services was needed, together with ""cleaner, greener buses"" and a programme of bus priority measures. These included ""effective and efficient bus lanes, priority traffic lights and improved bus shelters to encourage people out of their cars and back on buses"", she said. Plaid Cymru South Wales Central MS Heledd Fychan said the message from her constituents on buses was that they felt ""forgotten about and devalued, and don't feel listened to - they are anxious, and isolated"". ""This governments can change this, this government should change this,"" she said. ""We need action, not just words, and those actions are needed now."" Wales 'needs to do twice as much' on climate change Wales must prepare for 'hotter, wetter future' 'Spend Â£800m on public transport' to cut M4 queues Deputy Climate Change Minister Lee Waters warned there were ""tough choices"" ahead to make the bus a genuine alternative to travelling by car. ""This is a social justice argument. Eighty per cent of bus passengers don't have an alternative, but equally fifty per cent of people never travel on the bus,""  he told the Senedd. ""So there's a real social divide that we need to confront. Buses have to be for everyone and attractive for everybody and have to work for everybody. ""That's going to require investment, but it's also going to require tough political choices."" The Confederation of Passenger Transport Cymru, which represents bus operators, said members were ready to work with ministers to tackle the ""major challenges facing Wales"" in the wake of the pandemic. ""A frequent, reliable and cost-effective bus network, built in partnership, can address all of these challenges,"" said director Joshua Miles. ""The Welsh government needs to make bus priority measures a common sight across Wales, help kick start a transition to low emission buses and ensure transport funding helps operators deliver better services for passengers.""

Lift-off for European Union's new space programme,"Thierry Breton (Centre) and Josef Aschbacher (second from right) have a new partnership agreement The new EU space programme has been officially launched. It'll cover the period to 2027 and will see the bloc's 27 member statesdeepen investments,externalin satellite-navigation, Earth observation, space situational awareness and secure communications, among other activities. It also establishes a new body called theEU Agency for the Space Programme,external. Euspa will have oversight of everything the European Union does as a bloc in orbit. Another key advance in the new programme is the nature of the EU's relationship with the European Space Agency (Esa). EU must 'move at speed' on space broadband network EU orders next-gen Galileo satellites New Sentinels to check the pulse of Earth The pair are separate entities with national memberships that don't completely overlap - for example, the UK is in Esa but not in the EU, and therefore not in Euspa. But the EU uses Esa as its technical adviser and industrial procurement agent. The legalistic underpinning of this ""marriage"" has now been put on a formal footing in the guise of a Financial Framework Partnership Agreement (FFPA). The FFPA defines responsibilities and details the amount of money that will pass directly from the EU to ESA up to 2027 - some â¬9bn (Â£8bn; $11bn) out of a total EU space budget of â¬14.88bn. (The EU now funds a quarter of all Esa activities.) The EU and Esa are separate legal entities whose memberships are not identical EU funding during the coming period will help develop a next generation of Europe's satellite-navigation system, Galileo, and extend the scope and capabilities of its Copernicus-Sentinel spacecraft, which monitor the state of the planet. But in launching the new programme, Thierry Breton, commissioner for the internal market, stressed the need for Europe to become more agile. ""Space is going through massive transformation and rapid industrialisation, all around the world,"" he said. ""For Europe to maintain its leadership, we must rethink the way we do space in Europe. We must adapt to fast developments and anticipate new ones. ""We must set an ambitious - and disruptive - space agenda for the future: Be more dynamic, more innovative, more risk-taking!"" The worry is that Europe is falling behind more fleet-of-foot entrepreneurs in the US, as well as the financial muscle that China is able to put behind its space programme. China can launch its own astronauts to its own space station - Europe cannot Josef Aschbacher, the director general of Esa, said: ""We all know that in the US, the public spending is about five, six, seven times as large as in Europe; and the private spending is enormous. In 2019, the private sector (in the US) put $5bn into space. In Europe, in start-ups and SMEs, it was $188m. So a fraction of [what it was in the US]. ""China, as we all see in the news, is investing enormously. We've just witnessed three [astronauts] going to their own space station on their own rocket. And it makes me reflect - what does Europe want to achieve?"" Dr Aschbacher has proposed, along with Mr Breton, that a special summit be convened next year to try to establish the true level of ambition in Europe. What does it want to do and is it prepared to pay what it costs? UK industry bids farewell to EU's Galileo system European satellites to map global CO2 emissions The FFPA between the European Commission and Esa was negotiated over recent months. Tuesday's signature became possible only after all the agency's member states had approved the agreement's contents. These nations included those, such as the UK, who are not in the EU. The UK is no longer in the EU's Galileo sat-nav project, but it would like to continue in Copernicus Britain voted through the document at Esa's council last week, but only after two red lines were respected. The first concerned job discrimination within Esa. UK nationals cannot be prevented from working on EU-funded projects at the agency, except where the work relates to the most sensitive security aspects of those projects. And the second red line touched on intellectual property developed through R&D at Esa. If the EU wants primacy over that IP, it must state its interest right at the outset of a project. The UK does not want to fund innovations which it is then prevented from exploiting. There's a danger that security exclusions, and how tightly they are drawn, could become an area of increasing friction between the UK and the EU. If already sour relations deteriorate further, it's not impossible that we could see future British directors at Esa being asked to ""step out of the room"" when sensitive security matters of interest to the EU are being discussed. Much will depend on the protocols now being developed by the EU and the UK as part of their beyond-Brexit relationship. Britain wishes to continue participation in some EU programmes, including Copernicus and the science research framework known as HorizonEU, which includes a number of space-related activities. The size of the UK's ""subscription"" to these programmes has been set, but the fine detail of governance has not. It is, however, vital to both sides that talks reach a satisfactory outcome. Taking Copernicus as an example. The EU needs the UK's expected subscription of about â¬800m up to 2027 in order to fully implement plans for six new Earth observation satellite systems. And the UK, which does not possess a sovereign, multi-sensor satellite fleet of its own, can ill afford to be locked out of a capability it helped develop and fund in the years that it was an EU member.

Government approach to business chaotic - Heseltine,"Former Conservative industry secretary Lord Heseltine has described the government's approach to engaging with business as chaotic and incoherent. Lord Heseltine famously once said he would intervene in business and markets ""before breakfast, lunch and dinner"" if necessary, but takes a dim view of government strategy now. ""Under the present government it's all got chaotic,"" he said. ""One minute you have got an industrial strategy, the next minute you haven't."" ""New committees are set up then disbanded,"" he added. ""I think they are throwing money indiscriminately at a whole range of projects with very little attempt to co-ordinate the results, and very little attempt to mobilise local strengths, and very little attempt to analyse the competitive challenges we face."" A spokesman for the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy (Beis) responded that its ""Plan for Growth"" recognises that a ""strong and active government within a dynamic enterprise economy is central to our success"". ""Through major public investment in infrastructure, skills and innovation, we're going even further to support the creation of new industries and good-quality jobs, levelling-up every part of the UK,"" the spokesman said. But what is the appropriate relationship between government and business? Airbus has a site near Bristol I recently went to meet the Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng at Airbus's Filton site near Bristol. Airbus is a good example of government involvement in business. A pan-European government-driven and part-funded mission to take on American aviation giants. The UK's arms-length stake was sold off long ago, and recently Airbus was a fierce critic of Brexit, but it was all smiles as Mr Kwarteng officially launched a new Â£40m wing-technology centre, to which the government contributed Â£20m. ""It's a very close partnership,"" said Mr Kwarteng. ""During Brexit Airbus had one view, the government had another view, but today what's striking is that we are completely united. ""Airbus is a first rate company and they are very keen to engage with government collaboratively."" In the past the Conservative Party orthodoxy seemed to be to set taxes as low as possible, regulation as light as sensible, and let the so-called ""wealth creators"" get on with it. So what has happened to the DNA of the Conservative government? ""I think we are always a free market party,"" Mr Kwarteng said. ""But in 2021 we realise there are a whole range of industries that have a strategic relevance to the UK and we are very, very happy to work with the private sector to drive innovation."" But shadow business secretary Ed Miliband is not convinced the Conservative Party truly believes in a muscular role for the government in business. ""I think the problem with this government is that, first of all, we know that they have recently torn up the idea of having an industrial strategy, a white paper, and abolished the industrial strategy council,"" he said. ""Now that tells you something about them, which is basically they believe, more or less, that the market is going to serve us well, mainly on its own. So they pay lip service to the idea of the public sector playing a muscular role alongside the private sector. ""But it's not happening in practice. And that is deeply regrettable, because we face such massive challenges as a country, whether it's the climate crisis, or the inequality crisis, or recovering from Covid. ""The only way we succeed is with public working with private to create the wealth and tackle those challenges."" The problem for left and right is that governments are famously hopeless at investing, right? ""Not necessarily"" said Marianna Mazzucato, a professor at UCL, and author of ""Mission Economy - A Moonshot Guide to Changing Capitalism"". She said many of America's world-beating companies owe the US government their start in life. ""Tesla is doing quite well and everyone thinks that is just simply due to Elon Musk's genius, but Elon Musk, across his three different companies, has actually received $5bn from the US government,"" she says. ""Remember, the background is the US government is the financier basically of everything that makes our iPhones smart and not stupid - internet, GPS, touchscreen, Siri,"" Ms Mazzucato added. ""Actually government in many parts of the world has a really good track record, sometimes, so the point is not to just to say 'The DNA of government means they can't pick particular types of investments'. ""The way we should be doing it is not picking winners but picking the willing. ""So basically, once you choose the direction - towards a clean growth strategy for example - what does it mean to actually be able to support those kinds of companies in sectors that are willing to transform themselves to move into that direction?"" Former Labour Business Secretary Lord Mandelson said you have to be clear what industrial strategy is not. ""Industrial strategy isn't ministers replacing markets, it's not civil servants taking the place of chief executives,"" he said. ""It isn't government going around picking individual business winners, and instead finding out that the losers are instead picking the government, but what it is, in my view, is government acting as catalyst as a longer term planner and coordinator as investor. ""A big investor, when necessary, when financial markets shy away from risk, and also a supportive regulator for innovation. ""I mean, that's where I see industrial strategy, underpinning the partnership between business and government."" While both left and right may struggle to define what a successful industrial strategy should look like, both sides know it when they see it. Lord Mandelson said the vaccine rollout was an exemplar of industrial strategy working. ""I mean, look at what we achieved in the case of the vaccine,"" he said. ""The government staffed-up and invested in a portfolio of very high-risk technology ventures through a taskforce led by a venture capitalist, which was in turn based on very substantial public funding of the original research, the invention by Oxford University. ""Nimble accelerated regulation by the government helped expedite and accelerate the process. ""And then you had manufacturing by the private sector, and finally, distribution by the National Health Service. ""Now, one thing this wasn't, was a model of pure capitalism. And to me, it demonstrated the power of public procurement and coordination across the board, inside government and across the public and private sectors."" Lord Heseltine had one more brickbat to throw at the government. He also said there was nothing new about the idea of ""levelling up"" and said that Margaret Thatcher had personally backed his own version of it through investment in Liverpool after the Toxteth riots, but that the current Conservative government's approach was disorganised. ""Levelling up becomes part of the political imperative but there's no coherence or strategic plan behind it,"" he said. ""Margaret is interesting because she is seen by some people as the arch non-interventionist but of course that's absolute nonsense. ""She gave me the go-ahead to create the Development Corporations, which have been responsible for most of the really exciting urban regeneration schemes over the last 30 or 40 years."" Mr Kwarteng said the recent successes in the mayoral election in Teeside and by-election in Hartlepool was evidence the government approach to investing in former Labour strongholds was paying political dividends. ""It's no accident that voters are swinging towards the government in a way unprecedented since the war,"" he said. ""It shows the message of investment in skills and levelling up is really resonating."" Lord Heseltine revealed that a Conservative colleague said to him in the 1980s: ""Michael, what are you doing in Liverpool? There are no votes in it."" ""I was bowled over by this,"" Lord Heseltine said. ""I was doing it because it was right, not to win votes. If you gain the respect of the electorate then they will vote for you."" There are voices on the hard right, who think that government is always the problem and any project with government backing is doomed, and there are those on the left who think that government is always the answer to ensuring fair outcomes and banishing greedy economic rent seekers. One thing I can report is that the business community want the government to have an industrial strategy and quietly lament the retirement of that label in favour of the new ""Plan for Growth"". Labels aside, what is striking - remarkable even - is the general level of consensus between left and right that the challenges of the two greatest crises facing the global economy - Covid and climate - mean that government and business have never needed each other more than they do right now.

Scotland aiming to lift all Covid rules by 9 AugustThe current rules will remain in place until 19 July - with the aim of lifting remaining restrictions in August.ScotlandComments,"Scotland is aiming to remove all of its major legal Covid restrictions in early August, the country's first minister has announced. Nicola Sturgeon was speaking as she confirmed lockdown easing would be paused for three weeks to allow more time for people to be vaccinated. It means mainland areas will not move to the lowest level zero restrictions until 19 July. The hope is that the remaining rules will be lifted on 9 August. Ms Sturgeon said this would allow life in Scotland to return to ""almost complete normality"". But the government will not advise an immediate return to full office working on that date - and people will still be required to wear face masks in some settings. Live: Latest from Nicola Sturgeon's Holyrood statement What happens after Scotland's Covid 'pause'? What Covid rules are changing, and when? Scotland recorded 2,167 new cases on Monday - the highest daily total since the peak of the second wave in January - with the country said to have had the highest rate in Europe last week The percentage of Covid-19 tests coming back positive rose to 9.1%, up from 7.2% the previous day, and the deaths of a further four people who had tested positive for the virus have been recorded. The UK as a whole recorded 11,625 new cases and 27 deaths in the past 24 hours. The new daily case rate in Scotland is seven times higher than it was in early May and 40% higher than last week, with Ms Sturgeon saying the faster-transmitting Delta variant is ""now dominant"". But the first minister said the vaccination programme was breaking the link between the number of positive cases and the number of people being hospitalised and dying. The government's original ""route map"" out of lockdown would have seen the whole of Scotland move to level zero - the lowest point in the five-tier system of restrictions - from next Monday. This has now been pushed back to 19 July - the same date as measures are planned to be lifted in England. Island communities such as Orkney, Shetland and the Western Isles are already in level zero, with all mainland areas in level one or level two of the country's five-tier system of restrictions. Some ""minor"" changes will be phased in sooner - removing staff and suppliers of wedding services from the cap on numbers at services from Monday and allowing live entertainment at receptions, and allowing people from more than one household to help carry a coffin at a funeral. The move to level zero will increase the number of people who are allowed to meet up indoors, cut the requirement for physical distancing indoors from 2m (6.5ft) to 1m (3.2ft), and increase the number of people allowed to attend wedding and funerals to 200. Ms Sturgeon said this would be a ""significant step back to normality"", but said she wanted to move beyond level zero ""as quickly as it is prudent to do so"". She said the ""major remaining legal restrictions"" could be lifted from 9 August, signalling a ""return to almost complete normality in our day to day lives"". Ms Sturgeon added: ""We will consider and make a final assessment nearer the time of whether - as we hope - this could include the lifting of the legal requirement to physically distance indoors as well as outdoors."" However she warned that some measures, including the use of face coverings in shops and on public transport and ""rigorous and regular hand-washing"" would be needed ""at least for a period"". And the first minister said there should be ""appropriate phasing"" of the return of workers to offices after 9 August, saying the government would ""encourage continued support for home working where it is possible"". The first minister has always said that Covid restrictions would be driven by the data, not by dates. But Nicola Sturgeon has announced that Scotland can expect to be in level zero from 19 July,  and that all major legal restrictions could be lifted from 9 August. Looking at the raw data, this might seem surprising.  There are 154 new coronavirus cases a day in Scotland per 100,000 people. That's almost twenty more than the daily rate on Boxing Day, when the country went into another lockdown. The difference is the vaccine, which has dramatically reduced the consequences of catching coronavirus. Fewer people are now dying from Covid, down from an average of 31 a day in December to less than 2 a day now. That's why the Scottish government can look forward to a date when it can relax restrictions instead of imposing them. The changes are dependent on case levels being suppressed and targets being hit in the vaccination programme. All adults in Scotland will have had at least one dose of a vaccine by 18 July, with everyone in the 40-49 age group due to have had both doses by a week later. By 20 August, all 30 to 39-year-olds will have had a second dose, with everyone over the age of 18 due to have had two doses by 12 September. More than 2.6 million people in Scotland have had both doses of a vaccine Ms Sturgeon faced questions on her statement from opposition leaders at Holyrood - where MSPs are due to debate an extension of emergency powers into 2022. Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross welcomed progress with the vaccination programme and that ""we have more of an indication of when we will be free from restrictions"". He pressed Ms Sturgeon for more detail about what measures would continue after 9 August, including whether masks would still be required in offices and schools. Ms Sturgeon said the legal requirement for physical distancing could be removed at that point, but that in some settings - such as schools - masks may need to be worn for a bit longer. Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said ""we must make sure the last lockdown really was the last lockdown"", calling for clearer messaging and protocols around financial support.

Merkel gets Moderna jab after AstraZenecaExperts believe mixed dosing of Covid vaccines could be a good idea but it's too early to say for sure.Europe,"Mrs Merkel first received a dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine in April and then a dose of Moderna a few days ago German Chancellor Angela Merkel has received a dose of Moderna as her second shot of coronavirus vaccine having had Oxford-AstraZeneca as her first, a government spokesman said. The 66-year-old leader was vaccinated a few days ago after getting a dose of AstraZeneca in April. Experts believe mixed dosing of Covid vaccines could be a good idea but it is too early to say for sure. Mrs Merkel will be stepping down as leaderthis year after 16 years. In March,Germany, along with other European countries, halted the rollout of the AstraZeneca vaccineafter a number of blood clots cases were reported. Spike in Australians rejecting AstraZeneca vaccine Covid vaccines and rare clots - what do we know? Germany had previously restricted the use of the jab to over-60s,but is now set to offer it to all adults,external, German broadcaster Deutsche Welle reports. After a slow start, Germany's vaccination rollout accelerated in recent weeks. More than half of the country's population has now received their first dose of a vaccine. In April, Mrs Merkel's spokesman tweeted a photo of her vaccination certificate to show she had received the injection. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

There have been some studies conducted on the mixing of different vaccines. One study in the UK found that adults were more likely to report mild and moderate side effectsafter mixing doses of the AstraZeneca and Pfizer Covid vaccines. Some countries have been looking at mixing vaccines,externalin the face of supply shortages and to improve protection, Reuters news agency reports. This video can not be played WATCH: Pfizer v Oxford v Moderna â three Covid-19 vaccines compared The Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec have both said they plan to mix vaccines in the near future, amid uncertainty over shipments of the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab and concerns about rare blood clots. Experts believe mixed dosing of Covid vaccines could be a very good idea. It might give broader, longer-lasting immunity against the pandemic virus and new variants of it, and offer more flexibility to vaccine rollout. Studies are under way, but some countries are already allowing it within their national immunisation programs. Germany initially restricted the use of the AstraZeneca (AZ) vaccine to people under 60 because there wasn't much trial data available on efficacy in older people. It reversed that decision in April, offering it to all adults. Weeks later Mrs Merkel received her first dose. More recently, following reports of rare blood clots in a small number of younger people who had the AZ vaccine, Germany recommended that under-60s who had already received a first dose of should have a different coronavirus vaccine for their booster second jab for safety reasons, as a precaution. Merkel doesn't fit this age bracket, but, nonetheless, she's had Moderna rather than AZ for her second dose. It may prove to be a decision that gives her better protection, but until we have the evidence from large trials, it is really too early to say for sure.
