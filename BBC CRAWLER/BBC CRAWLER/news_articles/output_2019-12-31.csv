Two more people have been confirmed dead in NSW, bringing the fire-linked death toll to 12. Authorities say four people are missing in Victoria and another in NSW.

In his New Year message, Mr Morrison hailed the ""amazing spirit of Australians"" but warned that the weeks and months ahead would ""continue to be difficult"". The bodies of the latest victims - a 63-year-old man and his 29-year-old son - were found near the town of Corbargo in NSW. Police said the men, named as Robert Salway and his son Patrick by Australian media,had stayed behind to protect their family home, where their bodies were found on Tuesday,external. In Mallacoota, the local fire service said a change in wind direction had taken the worst of the fires away from the town. ""I understand there was a public cheer down at the jetty when that was announced,"" said chief officer Steve Warrington. Locals were left sheltering on the beach at Mallacoota on Tuesday morning About a dozen ""emergency-level"" blazes stretch across NSW and Victoria. Several holiday spots along the coast have been cut off and the main road in the region - the Princes Highway - has been closed. At midnight on Tuesday, Sydney's A$6m (Â£3.1m; $4.2m) fireworks display, renowned worldwide, went ahead despite calls for it to be cancelled given the scale of the bushfire crisis. Temperatures exceeded 40C (104F)in every state and territory at the start of the week, with strong winds and lightning strikes bolstering the flames. Meteorologists say a climate system in the Indian Ocean, known as the dipole, is the main driver behind the extreme heat in Australia. Residents fled to the beach or took up shelter in fortified homes when they heard the warning siren go off at 08:00 local time on Tuesday. One woman shared this picture of her young son wearing a mask and life jacket as the family fled on to a boat to escape the blaze at Mallacoota ""It should have been daylight but it was black like midnight and we could hear the fire roaring,"" said David Jeffrey, a local business owner. ""We were all terrified for our lives."" The fire was kept back from the shore, where firefighters had gathered for a last line of defence, by the change in wind. The beach town where fires turned day to night Victoria's state emergency commissioner Andrew Crisp told reporters there were ""4,000 people on the beach"". Many of those trapped on the beach could be forced to spend the night there. Why extreme wildfires are so dangerous How do you fight extreme wildfires? Fire chief Warrington said there had been ""significant property losses"" across the entire East Gippsland region in the past days. Authorities said bushfire had destroyed 43 properties in Gippsland, where more than 400,000 hectares have been burned.

Is climate change to blame for Australia's fires? Lucy Martin, BBC News, Merimbula For many Australians, the final days of 2019 have been a tense and worrying time. The smoke hanging in the sky day after day is a constant reminder of communities on fire. Some are staying inside to avoid the thick, acrid smoke, while others are cancelling holidays or taking long detours to avoid roadblocks. Here in Merimbula, on the New South Wales coast, the sun has been blotted out, casting a deep orange haze in the sky. People on the street are describing it as apocalyptic. The smoke is now so thick it's almost impossible to drive. The ground is blanketed in ash and supermarkets are packed with people stocking up with supplies.

William and Kate offer prize to 'repair the Earth',"The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge visited a melting glacier in Pakistan in October The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have announced a global prize to tackle climate issues, pledging ""a decade of action to repair the Earth"". Five winners will receive the Earthshot Prize every year between 2021 and 2030. The cash prize will be for individuals or organisations who come up with solutions to environmental problems. Prince William said the world faces a ""stark choice"" to continue ""irreparably"" damaging the planet or ""lead, innovate and problem-solve"". The announcement was made in a video narrated by Sir David Attenborough posted on social media. The veteran broadcaster and naturalist said the prize would go to ""visionaries rewarded over the next decade for responding to the great challenges of our time"". The prize is set to launch officially later in 2020 - a year that will also see the Convention on Biodiversity in China in February and the COP26 Climate Change Conference in Glasgow in November. A series of challenges will be announced, aimed at finding at least 50 solutions to the ""world's greatest problems"" including climate change and air pollution. Allow Instagram content?

More than 60 organisations and experts were consulted in the development the prize. It will initially be run by The Royal Foundation of The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, but could become an independent organisation. Kensington Palace said it would be supported by philanthropists and organisations. There is more than a little buzz around this project; the Palace is confident that it's got the right kind of people involved and it's not shy of ambition. ""A massive level of ambition"" to be precise - ""the biggest commitment the duke has ever made"". There are a lot of international prizes and networking-prizegiving events. Making this special, and keeping it special will be a challenge. The duke brings the strange lustre of royalty. But the global network of supporters will be critical to the prize's international profile. It represents another level of exposure for Prince William. It also makes him, rather formally, part of a group of figures who believe in the need for urgent international cooperation over climate change - a conviction that is not shared by everyone. The challenges will be rolled out in 2020 and will then renew each year, for a decade  - to stimulate the spirit of the race to the moon, but this time in service of the earth. The prize's name is inspired by former US President John F Kennedy's ""Moonshot"" - when he set a goal in 1961 to land American astronauts on the Moon before the end of the decade. The duke said: ""The earth is at a tipping point and we face a stark choice: either we continue as we are and irreparably damage our planet or we remember our unique power as human beings and our continual ability to lead, innovate and problem-solve."" Royals urge climate change action on glacier visit We could wreck world, Attenborough warns Prince Harry and private jets: What's the carbon footprint? Prince Harry 'troubled' by climate change deniers The royal couple hadtrailed the announcement with a cryptic tweet on Monday,external, which read: ""Stay tuned for our first announcement of 2020 very shortly..."" It is the latest in a string of public statements that the duke has made on environmental problems this year. In October,he called for more education and political actionto tackle climate change, as he and the duchess visited a melting glacier in Pakistan.

"Brexit will mark 'new chapter' for UK, says PM","The UK is on the verge of a ""new chapter"" in its history, Boris Johnson has said, as he promised to ""finish the job"" by delivering Brexit within weeks. In his new year message, the prime minister said he hoped the country would ""move forward united"" after it leaves the EU on 31 January. He vowed to govern ""for everyone"", not just those who backed him at the polls. And he said he wanted more prosperity and fairer opportunity to be the hallmarks of a ""remarkable"" new decade. Boosting resources for the NHS, improving the UK's infrastructure, tackling violent crime and protecting the environment were among his government's other main priorities for the year ahead, he said. Mr Johnson, who is currently on holiday in the Caribbean, said the ""first item on his agenda"" when he returned was delivering on the mandate of the people and taking the UK out of the EU. He said: ""We can start a new chapter in the history of our country, in which we come together and move forward united, unleashing the enormous potential of the British people."" MPs back Johnson's plan to leave EU on 31 January Government to shut Brexit department on 31 January Johnson hails 'radical' Queen's Speech The Conservatives' resounding election victory on 12 December had ""driven an electoral bulldozer"" through the deadlock in Parliament, he said, and offered a way out of the ""division, rancour and uncertainty"" surrounding the Brexit debate since the 2016 referendum vote. Legislation to ratify the withdrawal agreement with the EU easily cleared its first hurdle before Christmas, when MPs backed it by a majority of 124. With an 80-seat Conservative majority in the Commons, the remaining stages of the bill are expected to be completed quickly in January in time, the PM said, to ""get Brexit done before the end of this month"". ""That oven-ready deal I talked about so much during the election campaign has already had its plastic covering pierced and been placed in the microwave,"" he said. Mr Johnson said giving the NHS the resources it needed was his ""top priority"" While the UK is set to leave the EU's institutions at 23.00 GMT on 31 January, negotiations over its future economic relationship with the 27-member bloc have yet to begin, with experts saying they will be far tougher than those over the terms of the UK's exit. Mr Johnson has set himself a deadline of completing an ambitious trade deal by the end of 2020, when the 11-month transition period agreed by the two sides ends. Many leading EU figures have cast doubt upon the tight timetable and questioned the PM's ruling out of any extension. Mr Johnson has pledged to put public services at the heart of a One Nation agenda, promising billions of extra investment for the NHS in the next four years and levelling up schools funding across England. Ahead of what is traditionally the most difficult time of the year for the health service, Mr Johnson insisted it was his ""top priority"" and his ambition was to provide ""state of the art"" healthcare which remained free at the point of use. ""The loudest message I heard during the election campaign is that people expect us - expect me - to protect and improve the NHS."" He said he aimed to deliver a ""people's government"". ""I am acutely aware that there are millions of people who did not vote for me and were disappointed by the result,"" he said. ""If you are one of them, I want to reassure you that I will be a prime minister for everyone, not just those who voted for me. I know that you love this country no less, simply because you voted for another party or wanted to Remain."" Mr Johnson, who a year ago was languishing on the backbenches after quitting Theresa May's government, is said to be planning a major cabinet reshuffle and departmental reorganisation after the UK leaves the EU. He has also signalled that infrastructure and science will be at the heart of a Budget in March, with the aim of making the UK ""an engine for the ideas of the future"". He said he wanted to ""make the 2020s a decade of prosperity and opportunity"" with a ""fantastically exciting agenda"". In his new year message,Jeremy Corbyn has insisted Labour will remain the ""resistance""to Boris Johnson's government despite their heavy defeat while the SNP's Nicola Sturgeon saidleaving the EU was a source of ""deep regret""for many Scots and her government would do all it could to ""mitigate the worst impacts"". Elsewhere, Nigel Farage has said he is in no rush to make any decision about the Brexit Party's future. He told supporters that the party had ""changed politics for good"", despite failing to elect any MPs after it decided not to field candidates in more than 300 Conservative-held seats. ""Don't let anyone tell you that we have not succeeded in our main goals,"" he wrote in an email. ""We are now assessing thoughts and ideas as to what our next steps might be.""

MPs back Johnson's plan to leave EU,"This video can not be played MPs approve Brexit deal MPs have backed Prime Minister Boris Johnson's plan for the UK to leave the EU on 31 January. They voted 358 to 234 - a majority of 124 - in favour of the EU (Withdrawal Agreement) Bill, which now goes on to further scrutiny in Parliament. The bill would also ban an extension of the transition period - during which the UK is out of the EU but follows many of its rules - past 2020. The PM said the country was now ""one step closer to getting Brexit done"". Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn told his MPs to vote against the bill, saying there was ""a better and fairer way"" to leave the EU - but six of them backed the government. Mr Johnson insists a trade deal with the EU can be in place by the end of the transition period, but critics say this timescale is unrealistic. Pienaar: Are we witnessing the birth of Johnsonism? As it happened: Reaction to Brexit vote What is the Withdrawal Agreement Bill? What could Brexit look like by 2021? Brexit bill to give new powers to British judges Government to shut Brexit department on 31 January The bill had been expected to pass easily after the Conservatives won an 80-seat majority at last week's general election. MPs also backed the timetable for further debate on the bill over three days when they return after the Christmas recess - on 7, 8 and 9 January. Please upgrade your browser to view this interactive  Those MPs described as ""Did not vote"" may not have done so for a number of reasons. It could be they wished to abstain, or that they had constituency or ministerial business.  The Speaker and his deputies cannot vote and Sinn Fein members traditionally do not vote. The government says it will get the bill into law in time for the 31 January Brexit deadline. The legislation, which would implement theBrexit agreement the prime minister reached with the EUin October, was introduced in Thursday's Queen's Speech, setting out the government's priorities for the next year. By John Pienaar, deputy political editor ""Getting Brexit done"" turned out to be a useful slogan, and no doubt it helped Boris Johnson win the election. But almost nothing in politics is truly simple - least of all Brexit. Today he passed an historic milestone - but the destination is still some way off. Ruling out any extension to the Brexit transition period might mean Britain leaves with no deal - equally some in government believe it's possible we could see a kind of phased trade deal with the EU, thrashed out over the months and maybe years ahead. Read the article in full There are changes to the previous bill, which was backed by the Commons in October, but withdrawn by the government after MPs rejected a three-day deadline for getting it through Parliament. The changes include: Legally prohibiting the government from extending the transition period - during which a trade deal between the UK and EU will be discussed - beyond 31 December 2020 Allowing more UK courts to reconsider European Court of Justice rulings that have been retained in UK law after Brexit Requiring ministers to report annually to Parliament on disputes with the EU under the prime minister's withdrawal agreement Repealing spent legislation that ""now serves no purpose"" The bill also loses a previous clause on strengthening workers' rights. The government now says it will deal with this issue in a separate piece of legislation, but the TUC has warned that the change will help ""drive down"" working conditions.  June 2016:UK votes to leave European Union in referendum Mar 2017:Government triggers Article 50 to start withdrawal process Nov 2018:EU leaders and Theresa May agree withdrawal deal Jan-Mar 2019:UK Parliament rejects deal three times Oct 2019:New PM Boris Johnson agrees deal with EU Dec 2019:MPs back Johnsonâs Brexit bill by majority 124 votes Beginning the debate in the Commons, the prime minister said his bill ""learns the emphatic lesson of the last Parliament"" and ""rejects any further delay"". ""It ensures we depart on 31 January. At that point Brexit will be done. It will be over,"" he told MPs. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: ""We still believe this is a terrible deal"" Labour leader Mr Corbyn said the government's ""mishandling of Brexit"" had ""paralysed the political system,"" divided communities and was a ""national embarrassment"". He said MPs ""have to respect the decision"" of the EU referendum in 2016 ""and move on"". ""However, that doesn't mean that we as a party should abandon our basic principles,"" he said. ""Labour will not support this bill, as we remain certain there is a better and fairer way for this country to leave the EU."" The SNP's Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, said: ""Scotland still totally and utterly rejects Brexit, yet the prime minister is blindly hurtling towards the cliff edge with these Brexit plans that will leave us poorer, leave us worse off."" On the change in the bill that would legally prohibit the government from extending the transition period beyond 31 December 2020, Mr Blackford said: ""By placing that deadline, that risk of a no-deal Brexit, that we all fear is very much, is on the table again."" And the Democratic Unionist Party's Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said there was a ""major contradiction"" in the prime minister's deal ""that causes us great concern"". He said, while it mentioned ""unfettered access"" for Northern Ireland when it comes to trade in the UK, it also had customs arrangements ""that inhibit our ability to have that unfettered access"". In the 2016 referendum, the UK voted by 52% to 48% to leave the EU. But the subsequent difficulties in getting Brexit through Parliament have caused gridlock at Westminster.

Johnson hails 'radical' Queen's Speech,"This video can not be played Queen's Speech: Brexit, the NHS and what happened next Boris Johnson has claimed his programme for government is the ""most radical Queen's Speech in a generation"". The prime minister said planned new laws to toughen up criminal justice and increase NHS spending would deliver on the ""people's priorities"". But his main priority is the UK's exit from the EU on 31 January. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said many of the PM's promises mimicked the ""language of Labour policy but without the substance"". ""They say imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, even when it's a very pale imitation, but I fear those swayed by the prime minister's promises will be sorely disappointed,"" added the Labour leader. And SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford accused the PM of ""denying [Scotland] the right to choose our own future"" referring to the SNP's desire for another referendum on Scottish independence. ""Why did democracy stop in the prime minister's world with the independence referendum in 2014?"" he asked. But Boris Johnson said he felt a ""colossal sense of obligation"" to the voters. He told MPs that ""a new golden age for this United Kingdom is now within reach"" adding that the government would ""work flat out to deliver it"". LIVE: Reaction to State Opening of Parliament What does the Queen's Speech mean for you? What is the Queen's Speech and why is it important? Addressing Parliament for the second time in less than three months, the Queen said the priority for her government was to deliver Brexit on 31 January, but ministers also had an ""ambitious programme of domestic reform that delivers on the people's priorities"". Of the more than 30 bills announced in the Queen's Speech, seven were on Brexit. This video can not be played Queen's speech outlines plans for Brexit and NHS It comes as the government says it will close its Department for Exiting the European Union on 31 January. The seven bills announced that were devoted to Brexit cover legislation on trade, agriculture, fisheries, immigration, financial services and private international law. The first to be put to Parliament will be the Withdrawal Agreement Bill - the legislation that enables the UK to leave the EU - on Friday before the Christmas recess. Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn walked to the House of Lords together in silence Following last week's general election, the prime minister has a Commons majority of 80 - the largest enjoyed by a Conservative leader since Margaret Thatcher in 1987. Five big things on Boris Johnson's to-do list What is in Boris Johnson's Brexit deal? The prime minister's increased parliamentary authority and command of his party means it is likely to pass without major changes in the New Year in time to meet the 31 January deadline. In another move welcomed by Tory MPs, the bill willalso enable more British judgesto depart from previous rulings of the EU's top court. On the NHS, the government says it will enshrine in law a commitment on the health service's funding, with an extra Â£33.9bn per year provided by 2023/24. The PM's commitment on the NHS amounts to a 3.4% year-on-year increase in expenditure, a significant increase on what the NHS received during the five year Tory-Lib Dem coalition government as well as under his predecessors David Cameron and Theresa May. But it is significantly lower than the 6% average annual increases seen under Labour leaders Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. And when adjusted for inflation, and factoring in the increased cost of equipment, medicines and staff pay, it could actually be worth Â£20.5bn by 2023-4. The Tories' environmental plans analysed Do the Tories' broadband plans add up? Why do prisoners only serve half their sentence? Labour's health spokesman Jonathan Ashworth said: ""If the Conservatives' plans to put funding increases into law is to be anything other than an empty gimmick, we would urge them to pledge the extra Â£6bn a year which experts say is needed to start to make up the cuts they've imposed for a decade."" There was also a commitment announced for ministers to seek cross-party consensus for long-term reform of the social care system and the government will continue work to reform the Mental Health Act. This government wants to try to give the appearance that they are completely new, completely different, even though the Conservatives have been in power for nearly a full decade. That is quite a political stunt to try to pull off. But it's clear also that Boris Johnson came to the Commons today to present a vision that he hopes can straddle left and right, or what has traditionally been seen as Labour's place in politics and the Conservatives' place in politics. That is what the results of the general election gave him as an opportunity. And the challenge for Boris Johnson is not just to hold onto that for five years, but show to people who voted Tory for the first time that the party was worth the risk - that their vote was the right decision. The test will be enormous - whether or not all that rhetoric actually matches up to the reality of the actions and decisions that this government will make. Mr Johnson has had a reputation for years of being hungry with ambition to get to this place. We're going to find out in the next months and years whether he's hungry to take the decisions that actually will cement his place in history. Plans for longer sentences for violent criminals, were also unveiled, as well as the establishment of a Royal Commission to improve the ""efficiency and effectiveness"" of the criminal justice process and there are bills that will ensure the most serious violent offenders serve longer prison terms. And those charged with knife possession will face ""swift justice"". Other announcements in the Queen's Speech included: A ""points-based immigration system"", allowing the UK to welcome skilled workers On housing, landlords will get more rights to gain possession of their property and a new ""lifetime deposit"" scheme has been proposed which will mean tenants do not have to find a new deposit every time they move A pledge to cut business rates for thousands of retailers, pubs and restaurants across England and Wales. With the aim of helping struggling high streets, the government promised to increase the retail discount on rates by a third to 50%, costing Â£320m A new visa to ""ensure qualified doctors, nurses and health professionals have fast-track entry to the United Kingdom"" The removal of hospital car parking charges ""for those in greatest need"" New laws to ""accelerate the delivery of gigabit capable broadband"" The government will continue to take steps to meet net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 Work will be taken forward to repeal the Fixed-term Parliaments Act - which would enable the prime minister to call an election without the consent of MPs Thursday's State Opening of Parliament was the 66th time the Queen has opened Parliament - and has come only weeks after the last one on 14 October. There was less pageantry than usual, as was the case the last time a snap election was held in 2017. The Queen travelled by car from Buckingham Palace to Parliament, rather than by horse-drawn carriage, and she did not wear ceremonial dress.

Lawyer 'dumbfounded' after Ghosn skips Japan bail,"It remains unclear how Mr Ghosn managed to leave Japan, where he was awaiting trial A lawyer for former Nissan chief Carlos Ghosn says he is ""dumbfounded"" by the news that his client has fled to Lebanon after jumping bail in Japan. ""We were completely caught by surprise,"" defence team head Junichiro Hironaka told reporters, adding that he had not spoken with Mr Ghosn. On Tuesday, Nissan's ex-CEO, who was awaiting trial on financial misconduct charges, confirmed he had left Japan. He said he had not fled justice but escaped ""political persecution"". The 65-year-old was one of the most powerful figures in the global car industry until his arrest in November 2018. Carlos Ghosn: The driven 'cost killer' Carlos Ghosn and Japan's 'hostage justice' system Five charts on the scandal He was born in Brazil to parents of Lebanese descent and was raised in Beirut, before travelling to France for further education. The French and Lebanese foreign ministries say they have no knowledge of the circumstances of Mr Ghosn's departure from Japan and subsequent arrival in Lebanon. Lebanese media has said he flew in on a private jet in via Turkey. ""I am dumbfounded,"" Mr Hironaka told reporters later on Tuesday. ""I don't even know if we can contact him. I don't know how we will proceed beyond that."" He added that his legal team was still in possession of his passports. This house in Beirut belongs to Mr Ghosn. His wife, Carole, was born in the city Mr Ghosn was released on $9m bail in April under strict conditions that barred him from travelling abroad. How he could have left Japan remains unclear. It is not known whether he was holding duplicate passports - as some businesspeople are sometimes allowed to do. There was video surveillance of his home, and he had restricted phone and computer usage. Mr Ghosn released a statement after news agencies on Monday reported he had travelled to Lebanon. Confirming he had gone to the Middle Eastern country, Mr Ghosn said he would ""no longer be held hostage by a rigged Japanese justice system where guilt is presumed, discrimination is rampant, and basic human rights are denied. ""I have not fled justice - I have escaped injustice and political persecution."" This video can not be played Mr Ghosn's wife Carole told the BBC in June that Japanese officials were trying to humiliate her husband Mr Ghosn has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. Analysis by Quentin Sommerville, BBC News, Beirut The former Nissan boss will have no trouble finding somewhere safe and luxurious to stay in Lebanon. Of Lebanese heritage, Mr Ghosn spent his early years here with family members. He's much celebrated and even appears on one of the country's postage stamps. He is also the co-founder of the IXSIR vineyard here, which boasts wines that are rich and ""of remarkable elegance"". Escaping Japan would have been difficult given that his three passports were taken from him, but Lebanon has less than stringent border controls. Mr Ghosn is said to have arrived by private jet on Sunday evening and someone of his stature would have been able to breeze through immigration. When in town, he is often escorted by the security services. He's been held in Japan for more than a year and in that time Lebanon has changed dramatically. Months of protests against corruption and the political elite have ousted the prime minister, and there's a full-blown economic crisis. Japan gives millions in aid to Lebanon and will want Mr Ghosn returned. He may have successfully fled Japan, but he hasn't escaped his troubles. Once considered a hero in Japan for turning around Nissan - even becoming the subject of a Japanese comic book -Mr Ghosn spent 108 days in custodyafter his arrest in Tokyo in November 2018. Nissansacked him three days after his arrest. Prosecutors allege that he underreported his salary and diverted money from the carmaker to cover potential personal trading losses. He is also accused of transferring Nissan funds to a dealership in Oman, and skimming off $5m for his personal use. Mr Ghosn denies all the charges.

Oxford don forced to quit wins ageism claim,"Prof Paul Ewart said he was delighted ""especially for colleagues about to be made to retire in the middle of important work"" An Oxford professor forced to retire at 69 was unfairly dismissed by the university, an employment tribunal has ruled. Physicist Paul Ewart was discriminated against on the grounds of age when his contract was not renewed in September 2017, the hearing found. Current Oxford University policy means staff in senior grades must retire the September before they turn 69. A spokesperson said it was considering its options, including an appeal. Prof Ewart, who is originally from Northern Ireland, said he was delighted ""especially for colleagues about to be made to retire in the middle of important work"". He told the BBC he hoped he would be re-employed by the university and work with bosses to avoid further age-related disputes. He said: ""It has never been a matter of money, it's a matter of allowing people the dignity of continuing employment and providing worthwhile work in their life."" Senior academics at Oxford must currently retire by the September prior to their 69th birthday The university introduced the Employer Justified Retirement Age policy (EJRA) in 2011 in a bid to bring younger and more diverse staff into posts. In 2017 it changed the age from 67 to 68. In its judgement, the tribunal in Reading said the EJRA was highly discriminatory and it was ""hard to think of a more severe discriminatory impact"". ""There can hardly be a greater discriminatory effect in the employment field than being dismissed simply because you hold a particular protected characteristic,"" it said. Prof Ewart gave the tribunal statistical evidence showing the policy could only help create a small number of vacancies. The tribunal also said the university had failed to justify its policy. Discriminating against anyone at work because of protected characteristics, such as age, is illegal under the Equality Act 2010. In May, another Oxford don, Prof John Pitcher,lost a similar claim,externalagainst the university after he was made to retire at 67.

ScotRail racks up Â£10m loss amid contract woes,"The company that runs Scotland's rail services has reported losses of Â£10m over a 15-month period. Abellio ScotRail lost Â£7.9m before tax on turnover of nearly Â£990m between 1 January 2018 and 31 March 2019. Earlier this month, it was stripped of the contract to run rail services by the Scottish government amid criticism of performance levels. The rail operator said its results had been ""impacted by operational performance issues"". Abellio ScotRail contract to end three years early ScotRail admits it 'didn't do well enough' after delays Thousands of ScotRail services axed due to staff shortages ScotRail operates about 2,400 train services a day, and covers all services in Scotland except those run by other operators which cross the border. The Scottish government contract to provide rail services, worth more than Â£7bn over 10 years, was due to last until 2025. However, the government said a so-called ""break clause"" would be used to end the franchise three years early, in 2022. The company also revealed that it had not paid out any dividends to shareholders over the period, in accounts lodged at Companies House. Dominic Booth, managing director of Abellio UK, described the decision to end the contract early as ""the wrong choice for Scotland's railway and its customers"". He said the company had invested more than Â£475m in new and upgraded trains and created more than 500 extra jobs in Scotland. In its latest accounts, Abellio said it had set ""ambitious objectives"" at the start of its franchise in April 2015, with the ""biggest investment in new trains, track and stations since the Victorian era"". It went on to state: ""During this period of unprecedented investment and change, results for the period have been impacted by operational performance issues following major infrastructure upgrades of track and stations and the late delivery of new trains to support significant timetable improvements."" It added that since it took over the franchise, it had increased the number of seats available each weekday by 23% and increased overall rail services by 9% as a result of timetable improvements and bringing in more carriages in new and refurbished trains. Running ScotRail doesn't seem very easy or very profitable, if these accounts are anything to go by. Abellio ScotRail has - yet again - been unable to make a profit or pay back the multi-million pound loan it got from its parent company. Even shareholders go empty-handed. That could present a problem for the future. If Abellio - an arm of the Dutch state railway - can't run ScotRail to the standards expected by the Scottish government, who can? Since Abellio took charge, they've made a huge investment in electric trains, and increased the number of seats for passengers by 23%. But that wasn't enough. They lost the contract - officially, at least - because the Scottish government didn't accept their plans for the future. The fresh subsidy sought by Abellio was deemed too much. Scottish ministers now have two years to find a company to run the railway better than Abellio managed - and more cheaply than Abellio promised. Anyone bidding will wonder how they can do that, and still make a profit. By 2022, the UK government may have changed the rail franchise system. Perhaps a new ""concession"" system will be in place, which means the operator wouldn't own ScotRail trains or sell ScotRail tickets. That may open the door for a public sector bid - ""Calmac ScotRail"", anyone? But the clock is ticking. A new operator has to be in place by April 2022.

'Last embryo' boy born after 15 rounds of IVF,"Matheson Calon Tallett Vaughan Jones was born on 10 December A couple has brought home a healthy baby boy who was the ""very last embryo"" they implanted after deciding to call time on their attempts at IVF. Lewis and Hannah Vaughan Jones spent Â£80,000 on 15 rounds of IVF after being told they would not conceive naturally. They had decided that if the latest round of IVF did not work, they would give up on the treatment - but then Mrs Vaughan Jones became pregnant. The couple, who are both TV presenters, said baby Sonny was ""beautiful"". After about six years of an ""all-consuming"" emotional and financial struggle - and following medical advice - the couple decided to make a final attempt at IVF. ""We had zero hope... emotionally, we had already moved on,"" Mr Vaughan Jones said. ""We'd tried so many times and statistically it was so unlikely to work. And that's why we absolutely couldn't believe it when the very last embryo was the one that worked."" When Mrs Vaughan Jones, 38, became pregnant, her husband said he was ""terrified"" of another miscarriage. He could not bring himself to buy baby clothes or redecorate their home in Twickenham, south-west London until more than six months into the pregnancy. But Matheson ""Sonny"" Calon Tallett Vaughan Jones was born by Caesarean section on 10 December. ""It's been just as wonderful and crazy as you'd expect,"" Mr Vaughan Jones, who is also 38, said. Hannah and Lewis attempted more rounds of IVF than many UK couples can afford. The NHS limits how many cycles it offers to those who are eligible because of the price. Costs vary, but one cycle of treatment may cost up to Â£5,000 or more. Guidelines for the NHS recommend three cycles, but some NHS trusts offer less than this. There is no set cut off if you go private and have enough viable eggs and time to keep trying, although doctors would and should advise you to stop at some point - when they think the odds of success are too low to merit continuing. In general, the chances of IVF working decrease with age if the couple are using their own eggs and sperm rather than donor ones. If you are having trouble getting pregnant, you should speak to your GP, who can refer you to a fertility specialist. Mr Vaughan Jones, a presenter for the BBC News channel, said he and his wife ""knew how lucky we were that we've both got good jobs"" and could afford repeated rounds of IVF after one unsuccessful attempt paid for by the NHS. But he added that the couple had felt ""cheated"" and ""emotionally vulnerable"" every time they handed over more money. Mrs Vaughan Jones, a news anchor for CNN, first spoke openly about the ""hell"" of IVF inan article for the Times in 2017,external. She described the article as being a ""sort of 'coming out'"" because ""there was so much shame or stigma attached to infertility"". Mrs Vaughan Jones said friends told her writing the article was ""a brave thing to do"", but that to her it felt ""purely self-indulgent"" as it was like ""free therapy"". Allow Twitter content?

After Mrs Vaughan Jones's article, the couple documented their IVF journey in various ways, including uploading video diaries to YouTube to show others what the treatment involved. Mr Vaughan Jones said that while he was normally quite a private person and had felt ""nervous"" about his wife's article, he also recognised the importance of speaking out. ""We didn't see anyone talking about just how low, bad and difficult [IVF] is,"" he said. Mrs Vaughan Jones said she hoped by opening up about her family's journey, she could persuade others to do the same. ""I encourage people, even if they're naturally quite shy, to talk to someone, even if it's a stranger or the wonderful online communityâ¦ to just understand that you're not alone and there is support out there."" In IVF treatment, an egg is removed from the woman's ovaries and fertilised with sperm in a laboratory. The fertilised egg is then returned to the woman's womb to develop. IVF worked for the first time on 10 November 1977. On 25 July 1978,the world's first IVF baby, Louise Brown, was born. On average, IVF fails 70% of the time. The highest success rates are for women under 35, where a third of treatment cycles are successful. On average, it takes almost four-and-a-half years to conceive with IVF. Source: Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority/Fertility Network UK Fertilisation expert Dr Carol Lynn Curchoe said there had always been ""a general idea"" in her field of research that increasing rounds of IVF give infertile couples a greater chance of success - and thather own recent research,externalfound this was the case for some types of treatment. Dr Curchoe added: ""Having success after 15 rounds of IVF is an extraordinary accomplishment and shines a bright light on the miracles that can and do happen when doctors and patients don't give up.""

William and Kate offer prize to 'repair the Earth'The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge unveil a global prize to tackle climate issues in the next decade.UK,"The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge visited a melting glacier in Pakistan in October The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have announced a global prize to tackle climate issues, pledging ""a decade of action to repair the Earth"". Five winners will receive the Earthshot Prize every year between 2021 and 2030. The cash prize will be for individuals or organisations who come up with solutions to environmental problems. Prince William said the world faces a ""stark choice"" to continue ""irreparably"" damaging the planet or ""lead, innovate and problem-solve"". The announcement was made in a video narrated by Sir David Attenborough posted on social media. The veteran broadcaster and naturalist said the prize would go to ""visionaries rewarded over the next decade for responding to the great challenges of our time"". The prize is set to launch officially later in 2020 - a year that will also see the Convention on Biodiversity in China in February and the COP26 Climate Change Conference in Glasgow in November. A series of challenges will be announced, aimed at finding at least 50 solutions to the ""world's greatest problems"" including climate change and air pollution. Allow Instagram content?

More than 60 organisations and experts were consulted in the development the prize. It will initially be run by The Royal Foundation of The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, but could become an independent organisation. Kensington Palace said it would be supported by philanthropists and organisations. There is more than a little buzz around this project; the Palace is confident that it's got the right kind of people involved and it's not shy of ambition. ""A massive level of ambition"" to be precise - ""the biggest commitment the duke has ever made"". There are a lot of international prizes and networking-prizegiving events. Making this special, and keeping it special will be a challenge. The duke brings the strange lustre of royalty. But the global network of supporters will be critical to the prize's international profile. It represents another level of exposure for Prince William. It also makes him, rather formally, part of a group of figures who believe in the need for urgent international cooperation over climate change - a conviction that is not shared by everyone. The challenges will be rolled out in 2020 and will then renew each year, for a decade  - to stimulate the spirit of the race to the moon, but this time in service of the earth. The prize's name is inspired by former US President John F Kennedy's ""Moonshot"" - when he set a goal in 1961 to land American astronauts on the Moon before the end of the decade. The duke said: ""The earth is at a tipping point and we face a stark choice: either we continue as we are and irreparably damage our planet or we remember our unique power as human beings and our continual ability to lead, innovate and problem-solve."" Royals urge climate change action on glacier visit We could wreck world, Attenborough warns Prince Harry and private jets: What's the carbon footprint? Prince Harry 'troubled' by climate change deniers The royal couple hadtrailed the announcement with a cryptic tweet on Monday,external, which read: ""Stay tuned for our first announcement of 2020 very shortly...""

'Unique moment' for first mixed-sex civil partners,"Rebecca Steinfeld and Charles Keidan took their fight for civil partnerships to the Supreme Court One of the first mixed-sex couples to become civil partners hailed it as a ""unique, special and personal moment"". Rebecca Steinfeld and Charles Keidan, who won a legal battle for the right to heterosexual civil partnerships, celebrated at Kensington and Chelsea Register Office in west London. Previously, the law only allowed same-sex couples to be civil partners. About 84,000 mixed-sex couples could form civil partnerships next year, the government says. Introduced for same-sex couples in 2005, civil partnerships offer almost identical rights as marriage, including property, inheritance and tax entitlements. Where are heterosexual civil partnerships legal? How we are celebrating 'getting civilled' 'Time is running out for us' After Ms Steinfeld and Mr Keidan won their legal bid at the Supreme Court in 2018 for the right to have a civil partnership instead of a marriage, the rules were changed to make them available to everyone in England and Wales. The Civil Partnership (Scotland) Bill is currently making its way through the Scottish Parliament to make mixed-sex partnerships legal north of the border. And in Northern Ireland, a law whichrequires the government to legalise same-sex marriage next monthalso requires it to extend civil partnerships to opposite-sex couples. Speaking on the steps of the register office, Ms Steinfeld said their ""personal wish"" to form a civil partnership came from a ""desire to formalise our relationship in a more modern way, with a focus on equality, and mutual respect"". She said: ""So today is a unique, special and personal moment for us, a moment that we've been able to affirm our love and commitment to one another in the company of our beautiful children, Eden and Ariel, and close friends."" Ms Steinfeld said it creates ""new, modern possibilities"" for thousands of people to express their love and commitment and ends ""the unrivalled position of marriage"". She called for ""deeper discussions"" on giving legal recognition to other kinds of caring relationships, including those between friends, siblings and co-parents. Mr Keidan said they succeeded in their legal battle ""against all odds"" but added that their mental health has suffered under the strain. Five years after being refused permission to give notice of a heterosexual civil partnership, Rebecca Steinfeld and Charles Keidan will finally become civil partners today. Their conscientious objection to marriage and what they saw as its patriarchal associations led to a lengthy legal battle culminating in a unanimous Supreme Court ruling last year that the law was discriminatory and breached their right to a family and private life. The government changed the law, opening such a union to the majority of the UK's 3.3 million co-habiting heterosexual couples. Many believe they are already protected by so-called ""common law marriages"", but these do not exist. As a result, they do not enjoy the same property, inheritance and tax entitlements as married couples and civil partners. The government estimates as many as 84,000 mixed sex couples could become civil partners this year, giving them greater rights and protections within their relationships, without having to get married. Cathy Brown and John Grisswell, from Wirksworth, Derbyshire, are another mixed-sex couple to go through the civil partnership ceremony on the day it became possible. They had been married to other people before and wanted an alternative option. Ms Brown said she and Mr Grisswell felt ""strongly"" that ""repeating those vows and promises, knowing they hadn't worked the first time, wasn't the route we wanted to go down"". Mary Ann Lund and Gareth Wood, from Market Harborough, Leicestershire, also went through a civil partnership ceremony on Tuesday. ""It's more about the equality of a partnership rather than a marriage,"" Dr Lund said. ""That's something important to us, that we feel there is a kind of historical, patriarchal baggage in marriage and it's not particularly something that's for us."" Julie Thorpe and Keith Lomax are among thousands of opposite sex couples that are set to enter into a civil partnership Another couple, Julie Thorpe, 61, and Keith Lomax, 70, said they were looking forward to being among the first mixed-sex people to officially enter a civil partnership - but it would not change their relationship ""one jot"". The couple from near Hebden Bridge, West Yorkshire, have been living together for most of their 37-year relationship and have three children. They will have a civil partnership ceremony at a register office in Halifax. Ms Thorpe said: ""It won't change our relationship one jot. It will not make any difference to how we behave towards each other when we get up the next day. ""We have had a very successful relationship for 37 years and a bit of paper is not going to make any difference to that whatsoever. It does give us some legal protection within that relationship."" Mr Lomax, a human rights lawyer, added: ""It is a mutual celebration of all of those and also of the people who actually brought the case to court and changed the law in the first place, because that was a very brave and bold thing to do at considerable financial risk.""

London Eye: The wheel that changed a skyline,"The London Eye changed the view across the Thames On the last day of 1999, thousands of revellers gathered on the banks of the River Thames in London to wait for the spectacular firework display heralding the new millennium. But the end of a century was only the beginning for what is now an integral part of the capital's skyline - the Millennium Wheel. After wishing peace and prosperity upon the nation, the prime minister Tony Blair fired a laser beam across the Thames to mark the wheel's official opening. The landmark now known as the London Eye performed a rotation, although without any passengers. A technical issue meant it was not until March 2000 the public could go aboard. In the 20 years since that New Year's Eve night, the Eye has become an integral part of London's skyline, despite the fact the structure was only supposed to be in place temporarily. The Eye's 32 capsules, built in France by ski-lift company Poma, can each carry 25 people Standing 135m (443ft) tall, the cantilevered observation wheel is a feat of both vision and engineering. It was the brainchild of husband-and-wife team David Marks and Julia Barfield, of Marks Barfield Architects, who in 1993 entered their design into a competition held by the Architecture Foundation and The Times newspaper to find the best idea for a landmark to welcome in the new century. Mr Marks, who died two years ago, liked the idea of a big wheel because he wanted something that people could participate in and enjoy while up high, according to Ms Barfield. Julia Barfield and David Marks on the London Eye ""David felt the wheel has always been used as a symbol of time and symbolically it fitted,"" Ms Barfield said. ""It's actually one where the journey is as important as the arrival - the view unfolds as you go round."" The judges were not impressed with their idea or indeed any of the entries, all of which were rejected. But having invested time and effort in the application, the couple decided they would forge ahead and set up the Millennium Wheel Company. They lacked financial backing at this point - their industry was in recession - but both were convinced of the project's merits. In its first six months, about two million people visited the wheel Ms Barfield decided the observation wheel should be positioned close to the River Thames, on the South Bank near County Hall. But there was a major complication - they did not own the land. It belonged to the Arts Council (AC), which had leased it to the South Bank Centre (SBC). After lengthy negotiations with both the AC and SBC, the architects were given consent to use the land and this led to Lambeth Borough Council granting initial planning permission. However, this was just the first hurdle. A far bigger one was finding a way to raise the money for the multimillion-pound project. According to Ms Barfield, they had a stroke of luck when a journalist at London's Evening Standard newspaper came across their planning application and brought it to the attention of the paper's editor. The Standard decided to support them and launched a ""Back the Wheel"" campaign. The Eye can be lit up in different colours to mark special occasions This kick-started discussions with various potential backers, including the chief executive of British Airways, Sir Bob Ayling. The airline decided to fund the venture in exchange for 50% of the Millennium Wheel Company. The architects were now able to secure further funding and submit a full planning proposal. Ms Barfield said she and her husband had conversations with at least 25 groups and societies representing London, as well as its 32 boroughs. Marks Barfield was using computer-aided design, or CAD, which by the mid-90s was capable of generating images that were much more impressive than what had gone before. Ms Barfield said this really helped sell the project, and the plans were finally approved in 1996. A capsule on the London Eye is turned into a snowglobe for Christmas festivities However, according to Ms Barfield, the project was still in danger of foundering. There were fears the secretary of state for the environment, John Gummer, might call for a review of the application, causing a delay the project could not afford. ""If he had, it wouldn't have happened. We didn't have funds for a delay,"" Ms Barfield said. There was a vocal opponent in the shape of the chairman of the Royal Fine Art Commission and former Tory minister Lord St John of Fawsley, who said the wheel would be a ""white elephant"". ""We felt that he took against it instantly,"" said Ms Barfield, although the chairman of English Heritage, Jocelyn Stevens, was more supportive. He was quoted as saying ""we should embrace and celebrate heritage of the future, as well as the past"". The ""temporary"" London Eye landmark celebrates its 20th birthday on New Year's Eve Hollywood star Jessica Alba claims the record number of rotations by an overseas celebrity, at 31 There have been over 5,000 marriage proposals on the Eye All oils used on the Eye are biodegradable; the grease is edible and causes no harm to wildlife The capsules represent the 32 London boroughs but are numbered up to 33 as there is no capsule 13 The Eye was granted permanent status in 2002 More than 3.5 million people visited the Eye in 2018 Source: Coca-Cola London Eye Building work on the Eye began in 1998. It was made in sections and transported along the Thames by barge before being assembled on site. About 1,700 tonnes of British steel were used in its construction. To stay upright, the wheel depends on a massive central hub and spindle, which is 23m long and weighs 330 tonnes. Originally the wheel was to have 60 pods, representing each minute of the clock, but after tests at a ski-resort it was decided there would be 32. As well as being more cost-effective, this number of capsules allowed better views for riders. The Eye is the focus of London's New Year's Eve fireworks displays For Ms Barfield, a significant moment came early one morning when she watched from a bench on the opposite side of the river as the wheel was being moved from its horizontal position to the vertical. It was then it dawned on her the beauty of their creation. ""The sun was rising behind it and it was hovering over the river at a 35-degree angle - that was pretty special,"" she said. This video can not be played The London Eye was designed by husband and wife architects Julia Barfield and David Marks The first passengers to test the wheel, in December 1999 - mostly people who had backed the project or been involved in building it - almost did not include the architects. They received a call at the last minute saying it was ready and could they get there quickly. ""For me the most wonderful culmination was the amazing pre-eminence of St Paul's Cathedral, a perspective that had not been seen before,"" said Ms Barfield. Although Marks Barfield has been behind many feats of engineering since, including Brighton's i360 tower and Kew Gardens' treetop walkway, Ms Barfield remains extremely proud of the Eye. ""The observation wheel gives Londoners and visitors another way to appreciate the capital and being by the river really enhances this experience,"" she said. ""We couldn't have predicted its success and longevity. It's very heartening.""

Scotland 'centre of world's attention' in 2020,"The Scottish political leaders have all issued their new year messages Nicola Sturgeon has said Scotland will be at the ""centre of international attention"" in 2020 in her New Year message. The first minister led Scotland's party leaders in issuing her hopes for 2020. Jackson Carlaw, interim leader for the Scottish Conservatives, was optimistic about Britain leaving the EU. Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said Brexit and Donald Trump were some of the biggest challenges facing the UK over the next year. Scottish Secretary Alister Jack looked ahead to delivering a Brexit for Scottish farmers, fishermen and businesses, while Scottish Labour's Richard Leonard spoke of the climate emergency and tackling poverty. Nicola Sturgeon sees Scotland as being the centre of international attention in 2020 Ms Sturgeon's message highlightedthe UN climate change summit in Glasgow in Novemberas a key date for the year ahead, which she said would give Scotland the chance to show it is leading by example. Addressing the UK's scheduled exit from the EU in January, the SNP leader sought to reassure EU citizens and said the Scottish government would work towards giving people the opportunity to ""determine Scotland's future"". ""As we celebrate the start of 2020 and a new decade, we look forward to a year in which Scotland will be at the centre of international attention,"" she said. ""In November, the United Nations climate change summit in Glasgow will attract more than 30,000 people from around the world. ""Hopefully that summit will lead to progress in tackling the most important issue that the world faces. ""And it will give Scotland a chance to show that we are leading by example - not just byreducing our greenhouse gas emissionsbut by doing so in a way that helps to build a fairer, healthier and happier society."" The first minister added: ""The Glasgow summit comes near the end of what will be a historic year. ""Against the wishes of most people in Scotland, we will leave the European Union at the end of January. That will, I know, be a source of deep regret for many of us. ""In the year ahead, the Scottish government will do everything we can to mitigate the worst impacts of Brexit. ""We will provide support and reassurance for the EU citizens who have done us the honour of choosing to make Scotland their home. ""And we will work to ensure that people in Scotland have the chance to determine our own future -by deciding whether we wish to become an independent country. ""In all of this we will continue to ensure that Scotland remains an open, outward-looking and welcoming society."" Jackson Carlaw hopes tensions created by the EU referendum result can dissipate In his own New Year message, interim Scottish Conservative leader Jackson Carlaw spoke of his optimism that the UK can move on from a ""decade of division"". ""In the next few weeks, we willfinally be leaving the European Unionand delivering on the referendum we held in 2016,"" he said. ""The first thing to say is to speak directly to European citizens living in Scotland and the UK. ""We may be leaving the institutions of the European Union at the end of the month but the UK and Europe remain united by our shared continent. ""This is your home and we want you to stay."" He added: ""The fallout from the referendum result has created huge tensions across the country. ""I hope that, once we have left Brussels at the end of this month, those tensions will dissipate and we can come back together. ""It is time to move on from the decade of division."" Willie Rennie focussed on ""dark currents"" which have have buffeted liberal democracy Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said Brexit and Donald Trump were among the challenges facing the UK over the next year. ""Around the globe, dark currents have buffeted liberal democracy,"" he said in his message. ""Boris Johnson's Brexit threatens to cut us off from our European neighbours, whileDonald Trump's trade warsandTwitter tiradesthreaten to undo America's status as a global leader. ""These are the challenges we must face up to over the next 12 months."" He added: ""Closer to home there are huge challenges, too. ""From long waits for mental health treatment to the bungled roll-out of the new childcare entitlement, Liberal Democrats will highlight, debate and scrutinise the government so that everyone can rely on great public services that help them to build a brighter future."" A society ""free from poverty and inequality"" is what Richard Leonard called for in his message Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said: ""New Year is a time for reflection and it's also a time for resolve. ""So we should resolve, this New Year, and in this coming decade to build a better society, one which is free from poverty and inequality. Where we don't walk by on the other side. ""A society wherewe recognise there is a climate emergencyand take action. ""And a society where we are not putting borders and national boundaries up - but we are bringing them down. ""Let's resolve to work together to build that better society. Happy New Year."" Lorna Slater says Scotland needs to be ""bold and progressive"" Scottish Greens co-leader Lorna Slater said the country had come to the end of a very difficult year and faced an uncertain future. ""The new UK government should make us fear the worst for vulnerable people in our society, for intolerance and for the rights of our EU citizens,"" she said. ""With the new year we need to find new hope. While we can hope for a separate path for Scotland we can also begin to build a new Scotland now."" She said that by being ""bold and progressive"", Scotland could be ""even more distinct"" and lead the way in the UK. ""We can all play a part in this. Looking out for each other and showing solidarity can be an act of rebellion,"" she said. She said the world climate summit COP26, which is coming to Glasgow in 202 ""should be profoundly shameful to both the UK government and the Scottish government, as neither has taken any realistic or practical action to avert the climate catastrophe that is bearing down upon all of us"". She added: ""An emergency requires immediate radical action, which they haven't taken. Here, too, we must build the resistance; we know that our children deserve a future. ""Taking to the streets with our young people to hold those governments to account is one of the things I look forward to most this year. We can avert catastrophe and build a better future together. ""Happy New Year from the Scottish Greens. We look forward to rebelling with you."" Scottish Secretary Alister Jack's message was about delivering a Brexit that works for Scottish farmers, fishermen and businesses In his message, Scottish Secretary Alister Jack looked ahead to Brexit. He said: ""In one month's time, at 23:00 on Friday 31 January 2020, Scotland and the rest of the UK will be out of the EU, marking a whole new chapter in our country's history. ""I am proud to be Secretary of State for Scotland as we finally achieve this. ""After years of wasteful debate and delay, the UK government's strong majority in the Commons means, finally, we can get Brexit done. ""We will honour the result of the 2016 referendum and deliver a Brexit that works for Scottish farmers, fishermen and businesses."" He added: ""We are stronger and more prosperous as a union of nations. Let's put the rancour and division behind us and look forward to a better future together. ""I believe 2020 will be a year of growth and opportunity, as we work to boost the prosperity of every part of the UK.

William and Kate prize to 'repair the Earth',"The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge visited a melting glacier in Pakistan in October The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have announced a global prize to tackle climate issues, pledging ""a decade of action to repair the Earth"". Five winners will receive the Earthshot Prize every year between 2021 and 2030. The cash prize will be for individuals or organisations who come up with solutions to environmental problems. Prince William said the world faces a ""stark choice"" to continue ""irreparably"" damaging the planet or ""lead, innovate and problem-solve"". The announcement was made in a video narrated by Sir David Attenborough posted on social media. The veteran broadcaster and naturalist said the prize would go to ""visionaries rewarded over the next decade for responding to the great challenges of our time"". The prize is set to launch officially later in 2020 - a year that will also see the Convention on Biodiversity in China in February and the COP26 Climate Change Conference in Glasgow in November. A series of challenges will be announced, aimed at finding at least 50 solutions to the ""world's greatest problems"" including climate change and air pollution. Allow Instagram content?

More than 60 organisations and experts were consulted in the development the prize. It will initially be run by The Royal Foundation of The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, but could become an independent organisation. Kensington Palace said it would be supported by philanthropists and organisations. There is more than a little buzz around this project; the Palace is confident that it's got the right kind of people involved and it's not shy of ambition. ""A massive level of ambition"" to be precise - ""the biggest commitment the duke has ever made"". There are a lot of international prizes and networking-prizegiving events. Making this special, and keeping it special will be a challenge. The duke brings the strange lustre of royalty. But the global network of supporters will be critical to the prize's international profile. It represents another level of exposure for Prince William. It also makes him, rather formally, part of a group of figures who believe in the need for urgent international cooperation over climate change - a conviction that is not shared by everyone. The challenges will be rolled out in 2020 and will then renew each year, for a decade  - to stimulate the spirit of the race to the moon, but this time in service of the earth. The prize's name is inspired by former US President John F Kennedy's ""Moonshot"" - when he set a goal in 1961 to land American astronauts on the Moon before the end of the decade. The duke said: ""The earth is at a tipping point and we face a stark choice: either we continue as we are and irreparably damage our planet or we remember our unique power as human beings and our continual ability to lead, innovate and problem-solve.""

Nissan's ex-head Ghosn flees Japan to Lebanon,"It remains unclear how Mr Ghosn managed to leave Japan, where he was awaiting trial Former Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn has travelled to Lebanon after fleeing Japan, where he faces a trial over allegations of financial misconduct. In a statement, Mr Ghosn said he had not fled justice but ""escaped injustice and political persecution"". His lawyer said he was ""dumbfounded"" by the news and that he had not recently spoken with his client. It is unclear how the former chief executive officer managed to leave, as he was barred from travelling abroad. Mr Ghosn, who has an estimated net worth of $120m (Â£91m), was one of the most powerful figures in the global car industry until his arrest in November 2018. He denies any wrongdoing. His case has attracted global attention and his months-long detention led to increased scrutiny of Japan's justice system. Carlos Ghosn: The driven 'cost killer' Carlos Ghosn and Japan's 'hostage justice' system Five charts on the scandal The 65-year-old was born in Brazil to parents of Lebanese descent and was raised in Beirut, before travelling to France for further education. He holds French, Brazilian and Lebanese passports. But his lawyer, Junichiro Hironaka, told reporters in Tokyo on Tuesday that Mr Ghosn's legal team was still in possession of his passports. ""I don't even know if we can contact him. I don't know how we will proceed beyond that,"" he said. Lebanon has no extradition agreement with Japan. This house in Beirut belongs to Mr Ghosn. His wife, Carole, was born in the city Mr Ghosn was released on $9m bail in April under strict conditions that barred him from travelling abroad. Mr Ghosn released a short statement after multiple news agencies reported he had travelled to Lebanon. Confirming he had gone to the Middle Eastern country, Mr Ghosn said he would ""no longer be held hostage by a rigged Japanese justice system where guilt is presumed, discrimination is rampant, and basic human rights are denied. ""I have not fled justice - I have escaped injustice and political persecution. I can now finally communicate freely with the media, and look forward to starting next week."" Mr Ghosn has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing since he was first detained.His lawyers have accused the Japanese government of conspiring against him, calling the prosecution's case ""politically motivated"". Mr Ghosn's wife,Carole, told the BBC in Junethat authorities had sought to ""intimidate and humiliate"" the couple. This video can not be played Carole Ghosn called for President Trump's support over her husband's legal battle How he could have left Japan remains unclear. There was video surveillance of his home and he had restricted phone and computer usage. He had to surrender his passports to his lawyer, and had to ask for court permission to travel away from home for more than two nights. According to Japan's Kyodo News agency,the terms of his bail remain unchanged,external. Immigration authorities hold no record of him leaving the country, public broadcaster NHK reports. Analysis by Quentin Sommerville, BBC News, Beirut There's no sign of Carlos Ghosn at his $14m dusty pink mansion in one of Beirut's most expensive neighbourhoods. The building, which is subject to a legal dispute, is empty. But the former Nissan boss will have no trouble finding somewhere safe and luxurious to stay in Lebanon. Of Lebanese heritage, Mr Ghosn spent his early years here with family members. He's much celebrated and even appears on one of the country's postage stamps. He is also the co-founder of the IXSIR vineyard here, which boasts wines that are rich and ""of remarkable elegance"". Escaping Japan would have been difficult given that his three passports were taken from him, but Lebanon has less than stringent border controls. Mr Ghosn is said to have arrived by private jet on Sunday evening and someone of his stature would have been able to breeze through immigration. When in town, he is often escorted by the security services. He's been held in Japan for more than a year and in that time Lebanon has changed dramatically. Months of protests against corruption and the political elite have ousted the prime minister, and there's a full-blown economic crisis. Japan gives millions in aid to Lebanon and will want Mr Ghosn returned. He may have successfully fled Japan, but he hasn't escaped his troubles. Once considered a hero in Japan for turning around Nissan - even becoming the subject of a Japanese comic book -Mr Ghosn spent 108 days in custodyafter his arrest in Tokyo in November 2018. Nissansacked him three days after his arrest. Prosecutors allege that he made a multi-million-dollar payment to a Nissan distributor in Oman. Nissan, meanwhile, has filed its own criminal complaint against Mr Ghosn, accusing him of diverting money from the company for his own personal enrichment. He is also accused of underreporting his own salary. Mr Ghosn denies all the charges. Greg Kelly, a former Nissan executive who was arrested along with Mr Ghosn, is awaiting trial in Japan on financial misconduct charges. He denies conspiring with Mr Ghosn to falsify the former CEO's pay.

Retired Oxford don wins age discrimination claim,"Prof Paul Ewart said he was delighted ""especially for colleagues about to be made to retire in the middle of important work"" An Oxford professor forced to retire at 69 was unfairly dismissed by the university, an employment tribunal has ruled. Physicist Paul Ewart was discriminated against on the grounds of age when his contract was not renewed in September 2017, the hearing found. Current Oxford University policy means staff in senior grades must retire the September before they turn 69. A spokesperson said it was considering its options, including an appeal. Prof Ewart, who is originally from Northern Ireland, said he was delighted ""especially for colleagues about to be made to retire in the middle of important work"". He told the BBC he hoped he would be re-employed by the university and work with bosses to avoid further age-related disputes. He said: ""It has never been a matter of money, it's a matter of allowing people the dignity of continuing employment and providing worthwhile work in their life."" Senior academics at Oxford must currently retire by the September prior to their 69th birthday The university introduced the Employer Justified Retirement Age policy (EJRA) in 2011 in a bid to bring younger and more diverse staff into posts. In 2017 it changed the age from 67 to 68. In its judgement, the tribunal in Reading said the EJRA was highly discriminatory and it was ""hard to think of a more severe discriminatory impact"". ""There can hardly be a greater discriminatory effect in the employment field than being dismissed simply because you hold a particular protected characteristic,"" it said. Prof Ewart gave the tribunal statistical evidence showing the policy could only help create a small number of vacancies. The tribunal also said the university had failed to justify its policy. Discriminating against anyone at work because of protected characteristics, such as age, is illegal under the Equality Act 2010. In May, another Oxford don, Prof John Pitcher,lost a similar claim,externalagainst the university after he was made to retire at 67.

National living wage to rise by 6.2% in April,"The national living wage is to rise by 6.2% in what the government says is ""the biggest cash increase ever"". The rise is more than four times the rate of inflation and takes hourly pay for people over 25 to Â£8.72 from April. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: ""For too long, people haven't seen the pay rises they deserve."" But businesses warned that a sharp increase in wages would put pressure on companies and urged the government to reduce costs elsewhere for firms. The national living wage is the government-mandated minimum wage for over 25-year-olds. The minimum wage for under-25s will also rise. Is the minimum wage enough to live on? 'My boss lets me set my own salary' Hannah Essex, co-executive director of the British Chambers of Commerce, said that many companies ""have struggled with increased costs in a time of great economic uncertainty"". ""Raising wage floors so far abovethe rate of inflation,externalwill pile further pressure on cash flow and eat into training and investment budgets,"" she said. ""For this policy to be sustainable, government must offset these costs by reducing others."" From April 2020, the new rates are: The National Living Wage for ages 25 and above - up 6.2% to Â£8.72 The National Minimum Wage for 21 to 24-year-olds - up 6.5% to Â£8.20 For 18 to 20-year-olds - up 4.9% to Â£6.45 For under-18s - up 4.6% to Â£4.55 For apprentices - up 6.4% to Â£4.15 An independent report,externalpublished this year said there has been little or no evidence of job losses as a result of rising minimum wage levels, which are currently set at Â£8.21 for people aged 25 and over and Â£7.70 for 21 to 24-year-olds. Professor Arindrajit Dube, an academic in the US and an expert on the subject, said there was ""room for exploring a more ambitious national living wage"" in the UK in the coming years. He stressed, however, that because there is relatively little evidence available, the independent Low Pay Commission should be able to review the effect on jobs as pay increased. But the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) said ""an increase of this magnitude"" means firms may recruit fewer people, cancel investment plans or consider redundancies. ""There's always a danger of being self-defeating in this space,"" said Craig Beaumont, FSB director of external affairs and advocacy. ""Wage increases aren't much good to workers if prices rise, jobs are lost and there's no impact on productivity because employers are forced to cut back on investing in tech, training and equipment."" He said that small firms will need support, especially as there will be a 1.7% increase in business rates in April next year. The government also said it will press ahead with recommendations by the Low Pay Commission to allow workers over 21 to receive the national living wage by 2024 when it is set to reach Â£10.50 an hour. Since the National Minimum Wage was introduced by a Labour government 20 years ago, it's boosted the wages of the lowest-paid - defying predictions it would lead to higher unemployment. After 2016, a rebranded National Living Wage boosted incomes further for low-paid workers over 25. And in September the government accepted a recommendation from the Low Pay Commission that the new, higher minimum should gradually be phased in for younger workers over 21. The policy has helped to cut the number of people officially defined as being on low pay - those who earn less than 60% of the average - reducing income inequality. Those on the minimum wage now earn 13% more, in real terms, than they did in 2008. But this hasn't prevented rises in the number of working households in poverty. And in 2019 the average worker's pay still bought less, after taking account of inflation, than it had 11 years previously. Labour has called for a Â£10-an-hour minimum wage and said the government had not gone far enough to help those on the lowest pay. ""This announcement falls short on what is needed to help workers and comes against a backdrop of an economy created by Conservative governments over the past decade that has left millions of people trapped in low paid, insecure work and underpayment of the minimum wage on the rise,"" said shadow work and pensions secretary Margaret Greenwood. Frances O'Grady, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, said workers needed a national living wage of more than Â£10 ""now, not in four years' time"". ""This is a long-planned raise, but it's also long overdue. Workers are still not getting a fair share of the wealth they create. And in-work poverty is soaring as millions of families struggle to make ends meet,"" she said. The Resolution Foundation, a think tank which focuses on the living standards of low and middle-income people, welcomed the plan but its economic analyst, Nye Cominetti, said it was ""not risk-free"" in terms of inflation. He said: ""It should be matched by a renewed commitment to swiftly evaluating evidence of the impact of such large and sustained minimum wage rises and acting on that evidence if problems emerge."" The Living Wage Foundation calculates a separate, non-binding wage level which it describes as a fair level of pay, reflecting the cost of living. Around 6,000 UK employers pay this voluntary ""real living wage"" of Â£9.30, or Â£10.75 for those in London.

First mixed-sex couples enter civil partnerships,"Rebecca Steinfeld and Charles Keidan took their fight for civil partnerships to the Supreme Court One of the first mixed-sex couples to become civil partners hailed it as a ""unique, special and personal moment"". Rebecca Steinfeld and Charles Keidan, who won a legal battle for the right to heterosexual civil partnerships, celebrated at Kensington and Chelsea Register Office in west London. Previously, the law only allowed same-sex couples to be civil partners. About 84,000 mixed-sex couples could form civil partnerships next year, the government says. Introduced for same-sex couples in 2005, civil partnerships offer almost identical rights as marriage, including property, inheritance and tax entitlements. Where are heterosexual civil partnerships legal? How we are celebrating 'getting civilled' 'Time is running out for us' After Ms Steinfeld and Mr Keidan won their legal bid at the Supreme Court in 2018 for the right to have a civil partnership instead of a marriage, the rules were changed to make them available to everyone in England and Wales. The Civil Partnership (Scotland) Bill is currently making its way through the Scottish Parliament to make mixed-sex partnerships legal north of the border. And in Northern Ireland, a law whichrequires the government to legalise same-sex marriage next monthalso requires it to extend civil partnerships to opposite-sex couples. Speaking on the steps of the register office, Ms Steinfeld said their ""personal wish"" to form a civil partnership came from a ""desire to formalise our relationship in a more modern way, with a focus on equality, and mutual respect"". She said: ""So today is a unique, special and personal moment for us, a moment that we've been able to affirm our love and commitment to one another in the company of our beautiful children, Eden and Ariel, and close friends."" Ms Steinfeld said it creates ""new, modern possibilities"" for thousands of people to express their love and commitment and ends ""the unrivalled position of marriage"". She called for ""deeper discussions"" on giving legal recognition to other kinds of caring relationships, including those between friends, siblings and co-parents. Mr Keidan said they succeeded in their legal battle ""against all odds"" but added that their mental health has suffered under the strain. Five years after being refused permission to give notice of a heterosexual civil partnership, Rebecca Steinfeld and Charles Keidan will finally become civil partners today. Their conscientious objection to marriage and what they saw as its patriarchal associations led to a lengthy legal battle culminating in a unanimous Supreme Court ruling last year that the law was discriminatory and breached their right to a family and private life. The government changed the law, opening such a union to the majority of the UK's 3.3 million co-habiting heterosexual couples. Many believe they are already protected by so-called ""common law marriages"", but these do not exist. As a result, they do not enjoy the same property, inheritance and tax entitlements as married couples and civil partners. The government estimates as many as 84,000 mixed sex couples could become civil partners this year, giving them greater rights and protections within their relationships, without having to get married. Cathy Brown and John Grisswell, from Wirksworth, Derbyshire, are another mixed-sex couple to go through the civil partnership ceremony on the day it became possible. They had been married to other people before and wanted an alternative option. Ms Brown said she and Mr Grisswell felt ""strongly"" that ""repeating those vows and promises, knowing they hadn't worked the first time, wasn't the route we wanted to go down"". Mary Ann Lund and Gareth Wood, from Market Harborough, Leicestershire, also went through a civil partnership ceremony on Tuesday. ""It's more about the equality of a partnership rather than a marriage,"" Dr Lund said. ""That's something important to us, that we feel there is a kind of historical, patriarchal baggage in marriage and it's not particularly something that's for us."" Julie Thorpe and Keith Lomax are among thousands of opposite sex couples that are set to enter into a civil partnership Another couple, Julie Thorpe, 61, and Keith Lomax, 70, said they were looking forward to being among the first mixed-sex people to officially enter a civil partnership - but it would not change their relationship ""one jot"". The couple from near Hebden Bridge, West Yorkshire, have been living together for most of their 37-year relationship and have three children. They will have a civil partnership ceremony at a register office in Halifax. Ms Thorpe said: ""It won't change our relationship one jot. It will not make any difference to how we behave towards each other when we get up the next day. ""We have had a very successful relationship for 37 years and a bit of paper is not going to make any difference to that whatsoever. It does give us some legal protection within that relationship."" Mr Lomax, a human rights lawyer, added: ""It is a mutual celebration of all of those and also of the people who actually brought the case to court and changed the law in the first place, because that was a very brave and bold thing to do at considerable financial risk.""

Several holiday spots along the coast have been cut off and the main road in the region - the Princes Highway - has been closed. Victoria's state premier, Daniel Andrews, said navy ships might be called upon to provide food, water and power to the cut-off townships. In Mallacoota, residents fled to the beach or took up shelter in fortified homes when they heard the warning siren go off at 08:00 local time on Tuesday. One woman shared this picture of her young son wearing a mask and life jacket as the family fled on to a boat at Mallacoota ""It should have been daylight but it was black like midnight and we could hear the fire roaring,"" said David Jeffrey, a local business owner. ""We were all terrified for our lives."" ""There's a rock wall that they've built to keep back the sea, and that was where we were going to jump into the water if the radiant heat had hit,"" he added. The fire swept through the town destroying numerous buildings, but was kept back from the shore by the change in wind. Firefighters had gathered at the shore as a last line of defence. Victoria's state emergency commissioner Andrew Crisp told reporters there were ""4,000 people on the beach"".

Temperatures exceeded 40C (104F)in every state and territory at the start of the week, with strong winds and lightning strikes bolstering the flames. Meteorologists say a climate system in the Indian Ocean, known as the dipole, is the main driver behind the extreme heat in Australia. But much of Australia is also suffering from a record drought and scientists say climate change has worsened the conditions, making it easier for fires to grow. Lucy Martin, BBC News, Merimbula For many Australians, the final days of 2019 have been a tense and worrying time.

Some are staying inside to avoid the thick, acrid smoke, while others are cancelling holidays or taking long detours to avoid roadblocks. Here in Merimbula, on the NSW coast, the sun has been blotted out, casting a deep orange haze in the sky. People on the street are describing it as apocalyptic. The smoke is now so thick it's almost impossible to drive. The ground is blanketed in ash and supermarkets are packed with people stocking up with supplies.

The smoke is now so thick it's almost impossible to drive. The ground is blanketed in ash and supermarkets are packed with people stocking up with supplies. Holidaymakers should be swimming and hiking today, but they're checking into evacuation centres or planning escape routes. Have you been told to evacuate? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.

Two arrested over takeaway kebab 'poison pills',"Three women found pills in their kebab after visiting the takeaway at about 02:00 GMT Two men have been arrested after three women found pills in their takeaway kebabs. The women, all in their 20s, found the tablets after buying food at Istanbul Grill in Bognor Regis High Street on Sunday, Sussex Police said. Two local men, aged 30 and 42, were arrested on suspicion of administering poison with intent to endanger life, or inflict grievous bodily harm. Officers said they were investigating why the pills were in the food. Ch Insp Jon Carter said: ""The investigation is at an early stage, and exactly what happened, and the motivations of those involved are not yet fully understood. ""However, there is nothing to suggest that any other food outlets are involved.""

MPs floated 'farcical' idea of Russia joining Nato,"Sir John and cabinet ministers discussed cementing the improved links with Russia in the 1990s UK officials suggested inviting Russia to join Nato to ""integrate"" it into the West after the end of the Cold War, newly released secret documents show. The Ministry of Defence floated the idea of Russia becoming an ""associate member"" of the alliance in 1995, with the right to attend meetings but with no guarantees when it came to security. The proposal was dismissed at a top-level meeting at Chequers that January. According to minutes of the meeting, the plan was seen as ""farcical"". Nato - the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation - was established in 1949 to safeguard freedom, democracy and mutual security in Western Europe in the face of Soviet expansionism after World War Two. Members agree that an armed attack against one shall be considered an attack against them all, and that they will come to the aid of one another. What is defence alliance Nato? Nato explained in pictures But following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the idea of involving Moscow in the trans-Atlantic alliance was given serious consideration as a way of changing relations. A memo from the MoD, part of a set of newly declassified government documents from the National Archives, said ""integrating Russia into the European and Western family of nations in a realistic and sensitive way"" was ""the most difficult problem"" facing the UK and its allies. It acknowledged that making Russia - which at the time was led by Boris Yeltsin - a full member of Nato would ""always be impossible"" as it would require, under Article V of the founding treaty, the UK and other existing members to commit to coming to Russia's defence if its territory was attacked. But the official note suggested one possible solution was to ""create a new category of associate member"", giving Russia a recognised status within Nato, able to attend meetings and engage in discussions regarding security issues on the continent. Aides at the MoD agreed to keep the suggestion confidential ahead of the Chequers summit, which the then prime minister Sir John Major had called to discuss future foreign policy challenges and opportunities. During the meeting, then Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind stressed the need to make Russia ""a more normal member of our western family"", or risk it reverting to authoritarianism. The prime minister said the main threat from Russia was ""as a source of trouble"" through arms deals with poorer countries. Sir John Major and Boris Yeltsin in 1992 But the idea of involving Russia in any way with Nato was met with resistance, with the then Chancellor Ken Clarke expressing ""caution"" about expanding the alliance. A minute from the meeting concluded: ""At the extreme, some were even contemplating including Russia in Nato. That was farcical and should not be on our agenda."" Nato has grown hugely in the past 25 years, admitting a number of countries which share borders with Russia, such as Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, as well as several former Warsaw Pact countries, including Romania, Bulgaria and Albania. Critics claim the opportunity was missed to permanently reshape relations with Russia during the Yeltsin era and in the early years of Vladimir Putin's rule, before he pursued a more antagonistic relationship with the West. Major snubbed idea of Scottish time zone Major missed GB's Olympic gold for cricket The newly published documents also reveal how the prime minister used a literary flourish to sum up the UK's position in the world as he saw it at the time, describing the country as ""too much of a team player."" Referring to the PM's comments, the minutes add: ""We did not pursue our self-interest with the ruthless determination of the US and France. We had tended to play Sancho Panza to the US Don Quixote."" The reference was to the Spanish novel by Miguel de Cervantes, where Sancho Panza is a simple peasant who loyally follows land noble Don Quixote.

'Not enough NHS staff for cancer care' - charity,"There are not enough NHS staff to meet the needs of growing numbers of people with cancer, a charity is warning. Macmillan Cancer Support says patients are calling its helpline ""at breaking point"", feeling they cannot ask questions of the overstretched doctors and nurses caring for them. Key targets for cancer care are being missedas pressure on the NHS rises. The NHS said patient satisfaction levels and survival rates were both at record highs. Health ministers in England said they would make sure the NHS had 50,000 more nurses by 2025. The cancer charity's helpline received more than 240,000 calls this year, with most people needing emotional support, as a result of anxiety or fear over the disease. This was followed by issues with accessing hospital or community care, including difficulties contacting medical staff or getting hold of specialist medical equipment for use at home. Callers needing this kind of help have been rising for the past few years, outnumbering those calling about pain and side-effects of treatment, Macmillan says. Mandy Mahoney, 48, an outreach support worker from London, was initially diagnosed with breast cancer in 2011. She said: ""In recent times with the pressures on the NHS, I've become less likely to contact the hospital for fear of being a nuisance, but this has an impact on my mental health."" Ellen Lang, a service manager on Macmillan's Support Line, said: ""When you only have 10 minutes with your doctor, and your nurse is visibly rushed off their feet, it's inevitable that you'll leave without all the answers you need."" Is the NHS facing unprecedented demand? Hospital waiting times at worst-ever level Staff shortages fears over cancer plan Lynda Thomas, chief executive at Macmillan Cancer Support, said it was ""heart-rending that so many people call at breaking point having struggled to find the support they need from their healthcare team. ""NHS staff do an extraordinary job faced with huge pressures, but as increased demand for our services shows, there simply aren't enough of them to meet the needs of the growing number of people living with cancer."" The NHS target is for 85% of patients given an urgent referral by their GP to start cancer treatment within 62 days. However this target was last met in December 2015. Last month, NHS England figures showed that 76.9% of cancer patients started treatment within two months. Cancer targets in Scotland and Wales are also being missed. Rising numbers of people with cancer are being referred for treatment, NHS England said. In a separate report by Macmillan, 44% of specialist cancer nurses said their workload was having a negative impact on the care they gave to patients. And nearly one in five people recently diagnosed with or treated for cancer, said the doctors and nurses who cared for them seemed to have unmanageable workloads. An NHS spokeswoman said: ""Most importantly cancer survival is at a record high, and so too is patients' satisfaction with their care, with nine out of ten patients happy with the support they've received, all of which is testament to the hard work and compassion of NHS staff"". The NHS aims to give every person diagnosed with cancer ""access to personalised care plans including a needs assessment and health and wellbeing support"" by 2021, they added. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said there were plans to roll our ""hundreds of new diagnostic machines across the country"" and boost nurse numbers by 50,000. ""There are already tens of thousands more doctors and nurses on our wards since 2010 and we're investing an extra Â£33.9 billion a year in our NHS within the next five years,"" he added.

Huawei feels 'bite of winter' after Trump ban,"At Huawei, workers are either ""tree-growers"" or ""pit-diggers"" and the ""heady scent of plums"" comes only after the ""bone-deep bite of winter"". So says a poetic New Year's message from the Chinese telecoms giant which sets out its ""vision"" for 2020. But beneath the flowery language, Huawei admits life will be ""difficult"" after the Trump administration banned the firm from doing business in the US. ""Survival will be our first priority,"" it said. All you need to know about Huawei's problems Huawei launches new legal challenge against US ban Will 2020 break the curse of the folding phone? Huawei, which is one of the world's largest suppliers of 5G equipment, said sales growth for 2019 would be lower than it initially thought, rising by 18% to 850bn yuan (Â£92.7bn). That compares to revenue growth of 19.5% in the previous year. It forecasts that sales will stay under pressure in 2020 during which it expects to remain on the US Entity List. The US has classified Huawei as a national security threat amid claims the company has ""close ties to the Chinese government and military apparatus"". Huawei said the decision was based on ""innuendo and mistaken assumptions"". In its New Year's statement, the company's rotating chairman, Eric Xu, said: ""The US government's campaign against Huawei is strategic and long-term."" The UK government is expected to decide in January if Huawei will roll-out 5G mobile networks The US has also put pressure on other countries not to allow Huawei technology to be used in 5G networks, citing concerns over national security, which the Chinese company rejects. In January, the UK is expected to make a decision on whether to allow Huawei to provide equipment for the rollout of the next generation 5G telecoms networks across the country. Earlier this month, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: ""On Huawei and 5G, I don't want this country to be unnecessarily hostile to investment from overseas. ""On the other hand, we cannot prejudice our vital national security."" In its New Year's statement, Mr Xu said: ""It's going to be a difficult year for us."" But he urged Huawei's employees to look beyond adversity: ""If not for the bone-deep bite of winter, where would we get the heady scent of plums?"" In Huawei's plans for the year, he warned that managers who do not perform will face the axe. ""We will remove mediocre managers more quickly,"" he said. ""Those who prioritise short-term gains and pass problems on to their successors. The pit-diggers among us."" On the other hand, he said Huawei will promote people ""who help our customers succeed"". Huawei has told employees to prepare for a difficult year ""[Those] who put long-term success ahead of short-term gains by continuously contributing value to the company. The tree-growers among us."" Mr Xu used the message to thank Huawei workers, especially ""employees in the front lines who have been working day and night to patch up the holes in this embattled aircraft of ours and to their families who have stood by their side"". While he admitted the situation in the US presented a major challenge for the company, Mr Xu said Huawei should use it ""to motivate ourselves and build up some muscle"". And in a final rallying cry, he told Huawei employees to remember: ""We are the bamboo stalk that stands tall and proud against wind from all directions, whether north or south, east or west.""

A visual summary of bushfires,"Record-breaking temperatures and months of severe drought have fuelled a series of massive bushfires across Australia. Although recent cooler conditions and rain have brought some respite, more than 50 fires are still burning in the states of New South Wales and Victoria. Hot and windy conditions are forecast to return to many parts of New South Wales this weekend and authorities in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) have declared a state of emergency as massive bushfires rage south of Canberra. At least 33 people have been killed - including four firefighters - and more than 11 million hectares (110,000 sq km or 27.2 million acres) of bush, forest and parks across Australia has burned. Sorry, your browser cannot display this map If you can't see the map click here.,external In the worst-hit state, New South Wales (NSW), fire has affected more than five million hectares, destroying more than 2,000 houses and forcing thousands to seek shelter elsewhere. More than 1,600 firefighters are currently working to slow the spread of fires and shore up containment lines, the NSW Rural Fire Service says. What's Australia doing to fight the bushfires? Fires have raged near the Australian capital Canberra for weeks - at one stage shutting the city's airport as flames approached the perimeter. On Friday, the worst blaze was just south of the district of Tuggeranong, a 20-minute drive south of Parliament House. Fears are growing that the rising temperatures and strong winds could make the fire uncontrollable. But the NSW Rural Fire Service says it expects most of the flames to spread south east. The State of Emergency declared in Canberra gives extra power and resources to fire authorities, allowing them to force evacuations if necessary. Victoria, where fires have burned 1.2 million hectares, extended a ""state of disaster"" for the worst-hit areas from 2 to 11 January. Some blazes are still burning in the state and there are emergency warnings are in place. The military has sent troops, ships and aircraft to the region to help relocation and firefighting efforts. Three people - including one firefighter - have died as a result of the fires. What's Australia doing to fight the bushfires? Two people and an estimated 25,000 koalas were killed when flames devastated Kangaroo Island in the state of South Australia on 9 January. The island is renowned for its unique mix of animal species - and there are fears it may never recover. Experts have expressed concerns over the survival of endangered species on the island,externalwhich include the dunnart - a mouse-like marsupial - and the black glossy cockatoo. Tens of thousands of farm animals, mainly sheep, were also killed in the fire on the island. Saving Kangaroo Island's animal casualties Bushfires bring 'apocalypse' to Kangaroo Island Videos posted on social media showed efforts to rescue koalas which survived the blazes.

Elsewhere in South Australia, the Cudlee Creek fire is reported to have destroyed more than 80 homes in the Adelaide Hills region in late December. Fires are also thought to have destroyed up to a third of the vines that provide grapes for the Adelaide Hills wine industry. Canberra has seen some of the worst smoke pollution, with air quality rated the third worst of all major global cities on 3 January, according to Swiss-based group AirVisual. Satellite images from 4 January showed the spread of smoke from fires in Victoria and NSW, which has affected air quality as far away as New Zealand. Although Australia has always had bushfires, this season has been worse than usual. The amount of land affected across the country - more than 10 million hectares - is now comparable to England's land area of 13 million hectares. In pictures: Latest from the Australian bushfires Humans are sometimes to blame for starting the fires, but they are also often sparked by natural causes, such as lightning striking dry vegetation. Once fires have started, other areas are at risk, with embers blown by the wind causing blazes to spread to new areas. Bush fires themselves can also drive thunderstorms, increasing the risk of lightning strikes and further fires. The number of people killed as a result of the fires since September 2019 is higher than in recent years. Australia's deadliest bushfire disaster was ""Black Saturday"" in February 2009, when some 180 people died in Victoria. Clarification 10th May 2021: Australia's biggest fire occurred Dec 1974-Jan 1975 in western New South Wales and across the states and Northern Territory, when 15% of the country was burned. As we were unable to establish a confirmed death toll for these fires, they were not included in this graphic. If there is a serious risk of fire reaching homes or properties, authorities urge people to leave in good time as fire can travel fast - faster than most people can run. Many Australians are asking that very question - but the science is complicated. Scientists have long warned that a hotter, drier climate will contribute to fires becoming more frequent and more intense. Many parts of Australia have been in drought conditions, some for years, which has made it easier for the fires to spread and grow. Data shows that Australia has warmed overall by slightly more than one degree Celsius since 1910, with most of the heating occurring since 1950, the Bureau of Meteorology says. Australia broke its all-time temperature record twice in December. An average maximum of 40.9C was recorded on 17 December, broken a day later by 41.9C, both beating 2013's record of 40.3C. By the end of the month every state had measured temperatures above 40C - including Tasmania, which is usually much cooler than the mainland. The main climate driver behind the heat has been a positiveIndian Ocean Dipole (IOD)- an event where sea surface temperatures are warmer in the western half of the ocean, cooler in the east. The difference between the two temperatures is currently the strongest in 60 years. As a result, there has been higher-than-average rainfall and floods in eastern Africa and droughts in south-east Asia and Australia. Andrew Watkins, head of long-range forecasts at the bureau, said the dipole was crucial to understanding the heatwave. ""The key culprit of our current and expected conditions is one of the strongest positive Indian Ocean dipole events on record,"" he says. ""A positive IOD means we have cooler than average water pooling off Indonesia, and this means we see less rain-bearing weather systems, and warmer than average temperatures for large parts of the country."" And meteorologists warn that, for the moment, the intense weather and elevated fire risk in Australia is set to continue. Â© 2025 BBC.

First mixed-sex civil partnerships to take place,"Rebecca Steinfeld and Charles Keidan took their fight for civil partnerships to the Supreme Court One of the first mixed-sex couples to become civil partners hailed it as a ""unique, special and personal moment"". Rebecca Steinfeld and Charles Keidan, who won a legal battle for the right to heterosexual civil partnerships, celebrated at Kensington and Chelsea Register Office in west London. Previously, the law only allowed same-sex couples to be civil partners. About 84,000 mixed-sex couples could form civil partnerships next year, the government says. Introduced for same-sex couples in 2005, civil partnerships offer almost identical rights as marriage, including property, inheritance and tax entitlements. Where are heterosexual civil partnerships legal? How we are celebrating 'getting civilled' 'Time is running out for us' After Ms Steinfeld and Mr Keidan won their legal bid at the Supreme Court in 2018 for the right to have a civil partnership instead of a marriage, the rules were changed to make them available to everyone in England and Wales. The Civil Partnership (Scotland) Bill is currently making its way through the Scottish Parliament to make mixed-sex partnerships legal north of the border. And in Northern Ireland, a law whichrequires the government to legalise same-sex marriage next monthalso requires it to extend civil partnerships to opposite-sex couples. Speaking on the steps of the register office, Ms Steinfeld said their ""personal wish"" to form a civil partnership came from a ""desire to formalise our relationship in a more modern way, with a focus on equality, and mutual respect"". She said: ""So today is a unique, special and personal moment for us, a moment that we've been able to affirm our love and commitment to one another in the company of our beautiful children, Eden and Ariel, and close friends."" Ms Steinfeld said it creates ""new, modern possibilities"" for thousands of people to express their love and commitment and ends ""the unrivalled position of marriage"". She called for ""deeper discussions"" on giving legal recognition to other kinds of caring relationships, including those between friends, siblings and co-parents. Mr Keidan said they succeeded in their legal battle ""against all odds"" but added that their mental health has suffered under the strain. Five years after being refused permission to give notice of a heterosexual civil partnership, Rebecca Steinfeld and Charles Keidan will finally become civil partners today. Their conscientious objection to marriage and what they saw as its patriarchal associations led to a lengthy legal battle culminating in a unanimous Supreme Court ruling last year that the law was discriminatory and breached their right to a family and private life. The government changed the law, opening such a union to the majority of the UK's 3.3 million co-habiting heterosexual couples. Many believe they are already protected by so-called ""common law marriages"", but these do not exist. As a result, they do not enjoy the same property, inheritance and tax entitlements as married couples and civil partners. The government estimates as many as 84,000 mixed sex couples could become civil partners this year, giving them greater rights and protections within their relationships, without having to get married. Cathy Brown and John Grisswell, from Wirksworth, Derbyshire, are another mixed-sex couple to go through the civil partnership ceremony on the day it became possible. They had been married to other people before and wanted an alternative option. Ms Brown said she and Mr Grisswell felt ""strongly"" that ""repeating those vows and promises, knowing they hadn't worked the first time, wasn't the route we wanted to go down"". Mary Ann Lund and Gareth Wood, from Market Harborough, Leicestershire, also went through a civil partnership ceremony on Tuesday. ""It's more about the equality of a partnership rather than a marriage,"" Dr Lund said. ""That's something important to us, that we feel there is a kind of historical, patriarchal baggage in marriage and it's not particularly something that's for us."" Julie Thorpe and Keith Lomax are among thousands of opposite sex couples that are set to enter into a civil partnership Another couple, Julie Thorpe, 61, and Keith Lomax, 70, said they were looking forward to being among the first mixed-sex people to officially enter a civil partnership - but it would not change their relationship ""one jot"". The couple from near Hebden Bridge, West Yorkshire, have been living together for most of their 37-year relationship and have three children. They will have a civil partnership ceremony at a register office in Halifax. Ms Thorpe said: ""It won't change our relationship one jot. It will not make any difference to how we behave towards each other when we get up the next day. ""We have had a very successful relationship for 37 years and a bit of paper is not going to make any difference to that whatsoever. It does give us some legal protection within that relationship."" Mr Lomax, a human rights lawyer, added: ""It is a mutual celebration of all of those and also of the people who actually brought the case to court and changed the law in the first place, because that was a very brave and bold thing to do at considerable financial risk.""

Local shops urge action to save cash machines,"Tens of thousands of people now have no local cash machines and the problem is getting worse, says the Association of Convenience Stores. Because of fewer bank branches and the decline in free-to-use ATMs, many people rely on their local shop to withdraw cash, the ACS says. But with the Link network cutting the fees it pays to cash machine operators, more of them are disappearing, it says. Link must act to preserve access to cash in local communities, it adds. If Link does not respond by reversing the cuts in fees, the government should intervene to ensure that access to cash is protected, the ACS says. ""For millions of people, their local shop is now the only place where access to cash is available, especially as more than a third of bank branches have retreated from High Streets, towns and villages in the last five years,"" it added. One shopkeeper, Sunder Sandher, who runs a One Stop convenience store in Leamington Spa, said he had agreed to pay his cash machine provider Â£200 a month to keep it free-to-use after the firm tried to impose a charge, but he saw it as a service to customers. ""I serve the local community,"" he told the BBC. ""I had to keep it free-to-use because I was losing sales."" 'Request an ATM' service launched Free cash machines 'vanishing at an alarming rate' Battle to save remote cash machines Since the start of 2018, Link has reduced the interchange rate - the amount it pays per withdrawal to the operators of cash machines. As a result, the ACS said, the number of free-to-use ATMs had gone down by 13% between January 2018 and September 2019. ""Overall, one in 10 cash machines have been lost or moved to a pay-to-use model, denying people free access to their cash,"" the ACS said. In October, Link set up a scheme allowing communities to request a free-to-use ATM for their area if they are finding it hard to access cash. Link said it had received more than 2,700 requests for cash machines so far and that 20 new ATMs were in the process of being commissioned. Link chief executive John Howells said the network was ""delighted"" with the response. ""New ATMs are beginning to open and we have many more planned for the New Year,"" However, he added that many of the requests had been made in locations where a cash machine might not be viable, soLink was publishing details of areas,externalwhere there were no ATMs or Post Offices, ""to encourage innovation in cash access"". In response to the ACS, a Link spokesperson said: ""Cash use is falling and Link data shows ATM use also declining at over 10% year-on-year. ""Link believes that every community should have free access to cash and so has increased interchange where necessary to maintain a free ATM.  Where an ATM isn't possible, Link supports the free withdrawal service available at every Post Office."" Research by Which? indicates that 130 postcode districts with a total population of more than 115,000 people have no cash machines at all. The largest, PE32 in Peterborough, is home to nearly 15,300 people. A report published in September by banking trade body UK Finance said that there were 52,358 free-to-use machines operating in the UK at the end of 2018. Another 11,002 pay-to-use machines were also in place. A total of 2.4 billion withdrawals were made from these machines last year, with Â£193bn of cash being taken out. The number of withdrawals from ATMs dwarf the alternative ways that consumers can access cash, such as debit card cashback (150 million withdrawals in 2018) and over-the-counter withdrawals (55 million in 2018).

Australia's climate change action,"Prime Minister Scott Morrison has been criticised for the government's approach to climate change The Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison has defended his government's stand on climate change as the country deals with devastating fires and a historic heatwave. Mr Morrison said his policies on reducing emissions would ensure what he called a ""vibrant and viable economy, as well as a vibrant and sustainable environment."" Australia is one of the world's biggest per capita greenhouse gas emitters, and there's been a long-running debate about the country's approach to climate change. So what is it doing to reduce emissions? Under the Paris Climate Agreement to tackle rising global temperatures, Australia set a target for 2030 of making a 26-28% reduction in its emissions compared with 2005 levels. These goals have been criticised for being too low, and last year the United Nations (UN) reported that Australia was not on track. The UN found that:,external""There has been no improvement in Australia's climate policy since 2017 and emission levels for 2030 are projected to be well above the target."" About half of the G20 countries (those with the biggest economies), including Australia, are falling short. What is climate change? Climate change: Where we are and what you can do The Climate Change Performance Index ranked Australia last out of 57 countries,externalresponsible for more than 90% of greenhouse gas emissions on climate policy. It highlighted the country's no-show at a UN climate summit in September and its withdrawal from an international fund to tackle climate change. The opposition Labor Party in Australia has said the government is ""refusing to act"" on climate change. However, the Australian government maintains it is on course to meet its 2030 commitments. ""Our climate policy settings are to meet and beat the emissions reduction targets,"" according to Australian PM Scott Morrison. Bushfires have killed at least nine people and razed hundreds of homes Australian emissions will be only 16% lower than 2005 levels in 2030, according to projections published in December. How climate change has contributed to bushfires Why Australia's PM is facing climate anger amid bushfires Australia's long and dangerous summer ahead But it says it will meet the 2030 targets by counting the quantities of carbon already reduced under the previous international climate agreement, the Kyoto Protocol. More important than specific targets - Australia as a fossil fuel producer has so far failed to acknowledge the need to plan for a world of net zero emissions, says Myles Allen, a climate change expert at the University of Oxford. Net zero means balancing carbon emissions with carbon removal. Australia is among the world's largest exporters of iron ore, uranium, coal and natural gas. It was the fourth largest producer of coal in 2017, according to the International Energy Agency. Phasing out coal is considered crucial to limiting global warming to within 1.5C, but the Australian government is continuing to back the industryfor the role it plays in the economy. Facing criticism over his handling of the bushfires and response to climate change, Australian prime minister Scott Morrison said he will not make""reckless"" cuts to the coal industry. The government recently approved the construction of acontroversial new coal mine- which could be the biggest in the world and would export coal to India. A central climate plan is the Emissions Reduction Fund (ERF). The government put forward an additional A$2bn (Â£1bn) spread over 15 years to help businesses and farmers reduce emissions, bringing up total investment to $4.5bn. The government says it will deliver 100 million tonnes of emissions reductions. Though aspects of the ERF have been praised, ""Australia has adopted a piecemeal approach to emission reduction,"" said the OECD (an economic body which monitors richer, industrialised nations) in a 2019 report. The government needs to show how existing instruments, such as the ERF, can be scaled up to reach Paris Agreement goals, added the report. Scientists round the world are looking aghast at the politics of climate change in Australia. It's one of the most vulnerable countries on the planet to rising temperatures, yet there is still denial about the impacts of rising CO2 levels on events like the current wildfires. There is no serious doubt among scientific institutions that rising global temperatures are leading to record heat. The heatwaves are driven by a natural phenomenon but they are adding to an already over-heated planet. In the election, the victorious Liberal (conservative) Party categorised climate change as a metropolitan fad for urban professionals, and gained support for the world's biggest coal mine. Coal is the dirtiest fuel and scientists say we shouldn't be building more coal-fired power stations if we want to stabilise the climate. This piece was originally published on 24 December 2019.

Huawei: 'Survival will be our priority' in 2020,"At Huawei, workers are either ""tree-growers"" or ""pit-diggers"" and the ""heady scent of plums"" comes only after the ""bone-deep bite of winter"". So says a poetic New Year's message from the Chinese telecoms giant which sets out its ""vision"" for 2020. But beneath the flowery language, Huawei admits life will be ""difficult"" after the Trump administration banned the firm from doing business in the US. ""Survival will be our first priority,"" it said. All you need to know about Huawei's problems Huawei launches new legal challenge against US ban Will 2020 break the curse of the folding phone? Huawei, which is one of the world's largest suppliers of 5G equipment, said sales growth for 2019 would be lower than it initially thought, rising by 18% to 850bn yuan (Â£92.7bn). That compares to revenue growth of 19.5% in the previous year. It forecasts that sales will stay under pressure in 2020 during which it expects to remain on the US Entity List. The US has classified Huawei as a national security threat amid claims the company has ""close ties to the Chinese government and military apparatus"". Huawei said the decision was based on ""innuendo and mistaken assumptions"". In its New Year's statement, the company's rotating chairman, Eric Xu, said: ""The US government's campaign against Huawei is strategic and long-term."" The UK government is expected to decide in January if Huawei will roll-out 5G mobile networks The US has also put pressure on other countries not to allow Huawei technology to be used in 5G networks, citing concerns over national security, which the Chinese company rejects. In January, the UK is expected to make a decision on whether to allow Huawei to provide equipment for the rollout of the next generation 5G telecoms networks across the country. Earlier this month, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: ""On Huawei and 5G, I don't want this country to be unnecessarily hostile to investment from overseas. ""On the other hand, we cannot prejudice our vital national security."" In its New Year's statement, Mr Xu said: ""It's going to be a difficult year for us."" But he urged Huawei's employees to look beyond adversity: ""If not for the bone-deep bite of winter, where would we get the heady scent of plums?"" In Huawei's plans for the year, he warned that managers who do not perform will face the axe. ""We will remove mediocre managers more quickly,"" he said. ""Those who prioritise short-term gains and pass problems on to their successors. The pit-diggers among us."" On the other hand, he said Huawei will promote people ""who help our customers succeed"". Huawei has told employees to prepare for a difficult year ""[Those] who put long-term success ahead of short-term gains by continuously contributing value to the company. The tree-growers among us."" Mr Xu used the message to thank Huawei workers, especially ""employees in the front lines who have been working day and night to patch up the holes in this embattled aircraft of ours and to their families who have stood by their side"". While he admitted the situation in the US presented a major challenge for the company, Mr Xu said Huawei should use it ""to motivate ourselves and build up some muscle"". And in a final rallying cry, he told Huawei employees to remember: ""We are the bamboo stalk that stands tall and proud against wind from all directions, whether north or south, east or west.""

"4,000 people flee to beach as bushfire hits town","This video can not be played Residents have taken shelter on beaches to escape the flames Thousands of people have fled to a beach in Victoria, Australia, to escape bushfires racing towards the coast. Locals in Mallacoota described a ""terrifying experience"" of camping on wharves and boarding boats under blood-red skies. Military aircraft and vessels are to be sent to help rescue efforts. Officials confirmed another two people had been killed by fires in New South Wales (NSW), bringing the fire-linked death toll to 12. Authorities say four people are missing in Victoria and another in NSW. The beach town where fires turned day to night The bodies of the latest victims - believed to be a father and son - were found in the NSW town of Corbargo, which was hit by a massive blaze on Tuesday.

""[They were] obviously trying to do their best with the fire as it came through in the early hours of the morning."" Sydney NYE fireworks to go ahead despite protests A visual guide to Australia's bushfire crisis In Mallacoota, the local fire service said a change in wind direction had taken the worst of the fires away from the town. ""I understand there was a public cheer down at the jetty when that was announced,"" said chief officer Steve Warrington. This video can not be played Mallacoota resident David Jeffrey says people were ""terrified for their lives"" More than a dozen ""emergency-level"" blazes span a 500km (310 miles) stretch across two Australian states - from Batemans Bay in New South Wales to Bairnsdale in Victoria. Several holiday spots along the coast have been cut off and the main road in the region - the Princes Highway - has been closed. Victoria's state premier, Daniel Andrews, said navy ships might be called upon to provide food, water and power to the cut-off townships. In Mallacoota, residents fled to the beach or took up shelter in fortified homes when they heard the warning siren go off at 08:00 local time on Tuesday. One woman shared this picture of her young son wearing a mask and life jacket as the family fled on to a boat at Mallacoota ""It should have been daylight but it was black like midnight and we could hear the fire roaring,"" said David Jeffrey, a local business owner. ""We were all terrified for our lives."" ""There's a rock wall that they've built to keep back the sea, and that was where we were going to jump into the water if the radiant heat had hit,"" he added. The fire swept through the town destroying numerous buildings, but was kept back from the shore by the change in wind. Firefighters had gathered at the shore as a last line of defence. Victoria's state emergency commissioner Andrew Crisp told reporters there were ""4,000 people on the beach"". Steve Warrington from the fire service said: ""It is pitch black, it is quite scary... the community right now is under threat but we will hold our line and they will be saved and protected.""

Let us know by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external Authorities had urged people in the region - many of them tourists - to stay put because by Monday it was too late and dangerous to evacuate. Residents in the NSW holiday towns of Bermagui and Batemans Bay also fled on Tuesday morning to the waterfront or makeshift evacuation sites near the shore. Residents of Batemans Bay in NSW also headed to the water for safety Locals told the BBC they had ""bunkered in"" as the front approached, raining ash on the beaches. ""It was bloody scary. The sky went red, and ash was flying everywhere,"" said Zoe Simmons in Batemans Bay. Hundreds of massive blazes have destroyed millions of hectares in the eastern states of Australia since September. A ""freakish weather event"" killed a volunteer firefighter on Sunday, according to the NSW Rural Fire Service (RFS). He is the third volunteer firefighter to have died. Samuel McPaul, 28, a newlywed, was expecting his first child. Powerful winds near the NSW-Victoria border - generated by the fires - lifted his 10-tonne truck off the ground and flipped it over, the service said. Two other firefighters were also injured and suffered burns. The sacrifices of Australia's firefighters Is climate change to blame for Australia's fires? Temperatures exceeded 40C (104F)in every state and territory at the start of the week, with strong winds and lightning strikes bolstering the flames. Meteorologists say a climate system in the Indian Ocean, known as the dipole, is the main driver behind the extreme heat in Australia. But much of Australia is also suffering from a record drought and scientists say climate change has worsened the conditions, making it easier for fires to grow. Lucy Martin, BBC News, Merimbula For many Australians, the final days of 2019 have been a tense and worrying time. The smoke hanging in the sky day after day is a constant reminder of communities on fire. Some are staying inside to avoid the thick, acrid smoke, while others are cancelling holidays or taking long detours to avoid roadblocks. Here in Merimbula, on the NSW coast, the sun has been blotted out, casting a deep orange haze in the sky. People on the street are describing it as apocalyptic. The smoke is now so thick it's almost impossible to drive. The ground is blanketed in ash and supermarkets are packed with people stocking up with supplies.

Here in Merimbula, on the NSW coast, the sun has been blotted out, casting a deep orange haze in the sky. People on the street are describing it as apocalyptic. The smoke is now so thick it's almost impossible to drive. The ground is blanketed in ash and supermarkets are packed with people stocking up with supplies. Holidaymakers should be swimming and hiking today, but they're checking into evacuation centres or planning escape routes. Have you been told to evacuate?
