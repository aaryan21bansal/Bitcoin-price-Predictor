Iranian official threatens to seize British tanker,"This video can not be played The oil tanker is suspected of carrying crude oil to Syria An Iranian official has said a British oil tanker should be seized, if a detained Iranian ship is not released. British Royal Marines helped officials in Gibraltar to seize the super-tanker Grace 1 on Thursday, after it was suspected of carrying oil from Iran to Syria, in breach of EU sanctions. A court in Gibraltar has ruled the ship can be detained for a further 14 days. Iran latersummoned the British ambassador in Tehranto complain about what it said was a ""form of piracy"". Mohsen Rezaei said Iran would respond to bullies ""without hesitation"". Mr Rezaei - a member of a council that advises the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Khamenei -  said, in a tweet: ""If Britain does not release the Iranian oil tanker, it is the authorities' duty to seize a British oil tanker."" The BBC has been told a team of about 30 marines, from 42 Commando, were flown from the UK to Gibraltar to help detain Grace 1 and its cargo. Gibraltar said there was reason to believe the ship was carrying Iranian crude oil to the Baniyas Refinery in the Syrian Mediterranean port town of Tartous. The territory was initially able to detain the ship for 72-hours, but Gibraltar's Supreme Court granted a 14-day extension on Friday. Iran's Foreign Ministry condemned the initial seizure of the vessel as illegal and accused the UK of acting at the behest of the United States. The UK Foreign Office dismissed claims of piracy as ""nonsense"". Royal Marines disembarking Grace 1 on Thursday Spain's Acting Foreign Minister Josep Borrell said, on Thursday, Spain - which disputes British ownership of Gibraltar - was studying the circumstances of the action, but said it followed ""a demand from the US to the UK"". BBC defence correspondent Jonathan Beale said, while Britain has been keen to suggest it was an operation led by the Gibraltar government, it appears the intelligence came from the US. US to hit Iran with 'major' sanctions How renewed US sanctions have hit Iran hard By Kasra Naji, BBC Persian special correspondent Iran's threat to retaliate against the impounding of its super-tanker is an indication of how hurt Tehran is by the UK's action. In the eight years of war in Syria this appears to be the first time Iran's supply of oil to its ally has been interrupted, even though EU sanctions have existed for almost the whole duration. The episode also reflects worsening relations between Iran and the UK over a range of issues - particularly the continued imprisonment of British-Iranian motherNazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe. The tanker and its cargo are probably worth more than $200m (Â£160m). Iran is looking for ways to respond to what it sees as illegal and an act of piracy. It has the capability to take over a British ship in the Gulf and would see such a move as proportionate. On Friday, a senior Iranian lawmaker said the seizure of tanker was proof the UK ""lacks honour"" and takes orders from the US. Mostafa Kavakebian, who leads the Iran-UK parliamentary friendship group, tweeted that the seizure was ""a form of piracy and illegal hostility towards Iran"". Tensions between the UK and Iran have been exacerbated by the detention of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe White House national security advisor John Bolton said the seizure was ""excellent news"". He added that the US and its allies would continue to prevent regimes in Tehran and Damascus from ""profiting off this illicit trade"". Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the swift action would deny valuable resources to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's ""murderous regime"". The Baniyas Refinery, where the Iranian tanker was believed to be taking the oil, is a subsidiary of the General Corporation for Refining and Distribution of Petroleum Products - a section of the Syrian ministry of petroleum. The EU says,externalthe facility therefore provides financial support to the Syrian government, which is subject tosanctions,externalbecause of its repression of civilians since the start of the uprising against President Assad in 2011. The refinery has been subject toEU sanctions since 2014.,external Gulf crisis: Are we heading for a new tanker war? US-Iran relations: A brief history This latest row comes at a time of escalating tensions between the US and Iran. The Trump administration - which has pulled out of an international agreement on Tehran's nuclear programme - has reinforcedpunishing sanctions against Iran. Its European allies, including the UK, have not followed suit. Nonetheless, there have been growing tensions between the UK and Iran too, after Britain said the Iranian regime was""almost certainly"" responsible for the attacks on two oil tankersin June. The UK has also been pressing Iran to release British-Iranian motherNazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffewho was jailed for five years in 2016 after being convicted for spying, which she denies.

"Freeman 'overruled' opening of sick kids hospitalHealth Secretary Jeane Freeman says she decided the risk of opening the hospital was too great.Edinburgh, Fife & East Scotland","The Royal Hospital for Sick Children was due to open on Tuesday Health Secretary Jeane Freeman said she overruled NHS Lothian's plans to open the new children's hospital in Edinburgh next week. The Â£150m building in Little France was due to open on Tuesday but is now subject to indefinite delays. The decision not to open the landmark hospital came after last-minute inspections found safety concerns over its ventilation system. It is understood the health board had been considering a partial opening. Ms Freeman has ordered an investigation into the problems with the new building and said patient safety had to come first. Jeane Freeman said she was only notified of the problem on Tuesday She toldBBC radio's Good Morning Scotland: ""NHS Lothian were looking at options, they had not made a decision about what they wanted to do. ""I took the decision that it was not safe to open the hospital next week in any respect until I'd been assured for patient safety that every other area of that hospital met national standards."" Asked if she had overruled the health board, Ms Freeman said: ""Yes, I have."" The new hospital had been due to open in autumn 2017 The health secretary said she was informed on Tuesday that the ""final validation check"" of the ventilation system in Critical Care at the new Royal Hospital for Children and Young People was not meeting national standards. She said: ""Because this was picked up so late I want to be sure that all other safety checks in the rest of the hospital are also conducted again. ""The decision I took was that it was too great a risk."" The corridors of the new hospital will remain empty for some time The new 233-bed hospital will form part of the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh campus, providing care for children and young people to about 16 years of age. It will also have 10 theatres and a children's emergency department. The site, which also includes Clinical Neurosciences and Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services, had been due to open in 2017but a series of problems pushed that back. The building shares the same main contractor and design as the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow, which has also had problems with ventilation systems. Glasgow hospitals infection review team wants to hear from public Ms Freeman was asked in parliament last month if NHS Lothian had been assured the same problems did not exist at the new site. The health secretary said NHS Lothian told her it would not take ownership of the building until it was ""absolutely assured"" those steps had been taken. She said she now needed to find out why the health board was so confident the hospital was meeting standards ""when self-evidently in Critical Care it certainly wasn't"". Ms Freeman said she had asked for an audit of the safety checking process so she could identify where the mistake had been made. The main contractor building the hospital, Multiplex, issued a statement saying its work was signed off as complete by the Independent Certifier on 22 February, when it handed over the building to NHS Lothian. The health secretary said: ""There's no indication at this point that any fault lies with the contractors themselves."" Ms Freeman said she did not know how long it would be before the new hospital was opened but the old Sick Kids hospital would remain in use. She said there was ahelpline available for people who had appointments planned at the new hospital,external. Staff were ready to leave the old Sick Kids hospital Ms Freeman said she should have the results of the additional safety checks ""very soon"". If everything was ok with the rest of the site, there could be a ""phased move"" of other units such as outpatient services and neurosciences. She said work was under way to identify what upgrade was needed to the ventilation system in Critical Care. It was ""likely to take months rather than weeks"" before Critical Care and the Emergency department could open, she said. Ms Freeman admitted that there could be difficulties with any move if it was delayed until the winter months. ""At this point I can't say when Critical Care and the Emergency department will move into the new site,"" she said. Unison Scotland, which represents many NHS staff, said union members were feeling ""exasperated, shocked and concerned"". A dedicated helpline has been set up on 0800 028 2816. This will be operational from 12pm on Friday and will run until 10pm. After that the line will be operational from 8am until 10pm during the week and from 9am to 5pm on Saturdays and Sundays.

Unborn twins died after attack on pregnant mother,"Sentence was deferred at the High Court in Edinburgh A heavily-pregnant woman lost the twins she was carrying after being viciously attacked by the father of the unborn children, a court has heard. Stephen Ramsay, 36, repeatedly punched Lisa Donaldson, 35, throttled her and stabbed her in the neck in Glenrothes. The attack resulted in the deaths of both of Ms Donaldson's unborn children. She was 32-weeks pregnant at the time. Ramsay has admitted attempting to murder her. Sentence was deferred at the High Court in Edinburgh. The court was told that Ramsay had falsely accused Ms Donaldson of stealing money he had made while pretending to be homeless on the streets of Edinburgh. He attacked her in the home they shared in February of this year. Police officers kicked in the door of the Delgatie Court property and found Ramsay straddling Ms Donaldson with his hands around her neck. Ms Donaldson was unconscious and the floor around her was saturated with blood. Her throat had been cut and she was almost unrecognisable because of bruising and swelling to her face. She was taken to Victoria Hospital in Kirkcaldy where an emergency section was carried out to deliver the baby boy and girl, but both were dead. The court was told that Ms Donaldson named her twins Edith and Ajay. The medical opinion was that both had died as a result of the attack on their mother, who was initially put into a medically-induced coma. She suffered a spinal cord injury because of the stab wound to her neck and respiratory arrest, along with extensive bruising and at least 22 separate injuries on her torso alone. She also suffered brain damage and was left with balance problems in the wake of the attack. When he was told the babies were dead, Ramsay told police officers: ""I've murdered my kids. I don't deserve to be treated. I deserve to die, just kill me now."" He has extensive previous convictions including for assault, theft and fraud, and was under the influence of drink, prescription medication and illegal drugs at the time of the attack. Ramsay admitted attempting to murder Ms Donaldson while knowing that was 32 weeks pregnant with twins. The charge stated that he compressed her throat and restricted her breathing, repeatedly punching her and striking her on the neck with a knife causing severe injury, permanent disfigurement and danger to her life and causing serious injuries and significant blood loss which caused the death of the unborn babies. Judge Lord Kinclaven deferred sentence until 27 September and he was remanded in custody.

Racing pundit McCririck dies aged 79,"McCririck was an award-winning journalist and broadcaster Legendary racing pundit John McCririck, who for many years was the face of British horse racing, has died at a London hospital on Friday aged 79. McCririck made his career as the face of Channel 4's racing coverage, famous for his loud, eccentric style and his signature deerstalker hat. He also appeared on reality TV shows such as Celebrity Big Brother, Celebrity Wife Swap and Celebrity Coach Trip. He is survived by his wife Jenny. His family said he had been ill in recent months but continued to make several TV and radio appearances. Who was John McCririck? Tributes are being paid to John by figures from the worlds of racing and entertainment. ""Very sad to hear the news of John McCririck's passing - one of the most recognisable faces from the world of horse racing and a great at promoting our sport,""tweeted,external20-time champion jockey AP McCoy. Three-time champion jockey Frankie Dettori, 48, said he first met McCririck as a 16-year-old apprentice and the broadcaster was ""a big part of my racing life."" ""He was very flamboyant and controversial but I always got on really well with him,"" said Dettori. ""He did put on a bit of a show but underneath it all he worked very hard and he was very knowledgeable about racing."" The British Horseracing Authority also paid tribute, saying: ""Throughout a lengthy & colourful career one thing was always clear - his enduring passion & love for the sport of horseracing. He was a recognisable figure and resonated with the wider public."" Ascot Racecourse tweeted: ""He was an unmistakable presence in racing, and one of the most impactful broadcasters of his generation."" Broadcaster Nick Luck, a former Channel 4 colleague, added: ""Life without John McCririck will be far less interesting - he was a magnificent journalist first and a great showman. So often very kind to me and many, many others."" McCririck worked for BBC Sport early in his career as a sub-editor on Grandstand when the programme was presented by the likes of Frank Bough and Des Lynam. He went on to write for The Sporting Life where he won British Press Awards 'Specialist Writer of the Year' and 'Campaigning Journalist of the Year'. McCririck's profile grew when he energised racing broadcasts with lively updates from the betting ring, where he was not afraid to berate punters playing the fool in the background. When he was axed by Channel 4 in 2012, he launched a claim for age discrimination. ""I have put my own personal future on the line,"" he said. ""But I think it's so important for people in their 30s up to their 70s who fear anonymous suits and skirts coming along and getting rid of them."" He lost the case, and with it a significant amount of money, although he became a regular on reality TV shows. McCririck would make disparaging remarks about his wife Jenny, nicknaming her 'The Booby', but in truth they were a strong and happy couple. ""It's all a pantomime. Do I look like someone who is downtrodden?"" said Jenny. McCririck was still a regular sight - often smoking a fat cigar - at big race meetings in recent years although ill health meant he missed the Epsom and Royal Ascot fixtures last month. Viewers were shocked when he appeared frail and gaunt during one broadcast, although he retained his humour and ability to generate debate throughout. Cornelius Lysaght, BBC horse racing correspondent With a trademark deerstalker hat, his side whiskers and his waving arms plus a booming voice, McCririck became one of the most familiar faces on British television. A former bookmaker and award-wining journalist, his career took off as the betting specialist on Channel 4 Racing from the mid-1980s. He brought to wider audiences the secret 'tic-tac' communication system of the racecourse betting ring, with its unique terms including 'Burlington Bertie 100 to 30' and 'Double Carpet 33 to 1'. With his controversial views - particularly what was seen as a sexist attitude towards women including his wife Jenny - McCririck was dropped by Channel 4 in 2012. Latterly, he made only occasional TV and media appearances but lost none of his flamboyance. I have lost count of how many times people have come up to me and said 'do you know that mad guy with the whiskers who waves his arms around and shouts on the TV at the races - what's he really like?' The answer was that he was a complex character: a colourful pundit and showman who brought horse racing to a wider audience, but also courted controversy of course. He was a campaigning punters' champion and a generous and supportive colleague. He was practically the definition of the expression 'one-off'.

"Iranian official threatens to seize British tankerAn adviser to the supreme leader says Iran should retaliate, after the UK detained an Iranian oil tanker.UKTry the future of television","This video can not be played The oil tanker is suspected of carrying crude oil to Syria An Iranian official has said a British oil tanker should be seized, if a detained Iranian ship is not released. British Royal Marines helped officials in Gibraltar to seize the super-tanker Grace 1 on Thursday, after it was suspected of carrying oil from Iran to Syria, in breach of EU sanctions. A court in Gibraltar has ruled the ship can be detained for a further 14 days. Iran latersummoned the British ambassador in Tehranto complain about what it said was a ""form of piracy"". Mohsen Rezaei said Iran would respond to bullies ""without hesitation"". Mr Rezaei - a member of a council that advises the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Khamenei -  said, in a tweet: ""If Britain does not release the Iranian oil tanker, it is the authorities' duty to seize a British oil tanker."" The BBC has been told a team of about 30 marines, from 42 Commando, were flown from the UK to Gibraltar to help detain Grace 1 and its cargo. Gibraltar said there was reason to believe the ship was carrying Iranian crude oil to the Baniyas Refinery in the Syrian Mediterranean port town of Tartous. The territory was initially able to detain the ship for 72-hours, but Gibraltar's Supreme Court granted a 14-day extension on Friday. Iran's Foreign Ministry condemned the initial seizure of the vessel as illegal and accused the UK of acting at the behest of the United States. The UK Foreign Office dismissed claims of piracy as ""nonsense"". Royal Marines disembarking Grace 1 on Thursday Spain's Acting Foreign Minister Josep Borrell said, on Thursday, Spain - which disputes British ownership of Gibraltar - was studying the circumstances of the action, but said it followed ""a demand from the US to the UK"". BBC defence correspondent Jonathan Beale said, while Britain has been keen to suggest it was an operation led by the Gibraltar government, it appears the intelligence came from the US. US to hit Iran with 'major' sanctions How renewed US sanctions have hit Iran hard By Kasra Naji, BBC Persian special correspondent Iran's threat to retaliate against the impounding of its super-tanker is an indication of how hurt Tehran is by the UK's action. In the eight years of war in Syria this appears to be the first time Iran's supply of oil to its ally has been interrupted, even though EU sanctions have existed for almost the whole duration. The episode also reflects worsening relations between Iran and the UK over a range of issues - particularly the continued imprisonment of British-Iranian motherNazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe. The tanker and its cargo are probably worth more than $200m (Â£160m). Iran is looking for ways to respond to what it sees as illegal and an act of piracy. It has the capability to take over a British ship in the Gulf and would see such a move as proportionate. On Friday, a senior Iranian lawmaker said the seizure of tanker was proof the UK ""lacks honour"" and takes orders from the US. Mostafa Kavakebian, who leads the Iran-UK parliamentary friendship group, tweeted that the seizure was ""a form of piracy and illegal hostility towards Iran"". Tensions between the UK and Iran have been exacerbated by the detention of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe White House national security advisor John Bolton said the seizure was ""excellent news"". He added that the US and its allies would continue to prevent regimes in Tehran and Damascus from ""profiting off this illicit trade"".

Russia mini-sub fire: Putin issues heroism awards,"The Russian Defence Ministry published these photos of the officers who died and named them The Russian president Vladimir Putin has bestowed top state awards on four of the 14 submarine crew who died during a secret mission on 1 July. The four officers, all captains, received Hero of Russia medals. Two other officers on board already had those medals for earlier missions. The Kremlin said the crew heroically contained a fire, preventing it reaching the nuclear power unit. They inhaled toxic smoke produced by the fire, the Kremlin said. The other 10 who died in the disaster in the Barents Sea, also officers, received Russia's Order of Courage. The surviving crew managed to get the deep-sea research vessel back to its Arctic base, Severomorsk, near Murmansk. The bodies of the 14 dead were brought to St Petersburg for burial at the city's Serafim cemetery. Their naval unit is based in the city's Peterhof district. Fresh flowers were laid at a Murmansk memorial erected after the 2000 Kursk disaster The Russian government said it is confident that the secret submersible, which it refused to name, can be put back into service soon. The vessel had been exploring the Arctic seabed. The government did not reveal details of the mission that turned into a disaster, citing official secrecy. The submersible was widely reported to be an AS-12 or AS-31 type nicknamed ""Losharik"". Russia's Tass news agency reported that the officers were linked to the Russian military's top-secret Chief Directorate for Deep Water Research, known as GUGI. One of the officers, Denis Dolonsky, was made a Hero of Russia in 2012. In that year he took part in the Arktika-2012 mission, Tass said, which involved collecting rock samples from the Arctic seabed - part of a Russian Arctic territorial claim. The International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) reported,externalthat a Losharik vessel guided two Russian icebreakers, which drilled boreholes and collected seabed rock on the Mendeleev Ridge, intended to prove that the Russian continental shelf extends far under the Arctic Ocean. A UN commission is assessing rival continental shelf claims in the Arctic, based on data submitted by Russia, Canada, the US, Norway and Denmark.

Denmark lays claim to North Pole Russian media reports said that one of the submersible's sailors heroically rescued a civilian specialist from the burning battery compartment, then sealed the hatch. ButPavel Felgenhauer, a military analyst at the independent Russian daily Novaya Gazeta,,externalsaid it was a mystery why 14 sailors died from smoke inhalation when they would have all carried oxygen masks at all times and had access to emergency on-board oxygen supplies. It is also a mystery, he wrote, why so many senior officers were on one mission. He speculated that they might have been testing new secret equipment or examining US seabed devices placed to track Russian submarines. Mr Felgenhauer also asked why Russia would use a secret submersible capable of diving down to 6,000m (19,685ft), when the Barents Sea is on average only 220m deep. Russia is in an international race to stake territorial claims in the Arctic, because the pristine region is believed to be rich in oil and gas and other minerals. Global warming is also opening up new Arctic sea routes, potentially valuable for trade. On Thursday, Russia's Defence Minister, Sergei Shoigu, said the craft's nuclear power unit had ""been fully isolated and nobody [was] in that section"". ""The crew took all the necessary measures to protect the unit and it is in full working condition,"" he said. ""This gives us hope that in quite a short time the vessel can be put back into service."" GUGI's main tasks are reported to include monitoring foreign underwater communication lines, recovering military equipment from the seabed and protecting Russia's own seabed communications cables. Accidents involving underwater vessels are rare. Here are some of the most serious: The Argentine navy'sARA San Juansubmarine with 44 crew disappeared during a routine patrol in the South Atlantic in 2017. The wreckage was found a year later All 70 crew aboard China'sGreat WallMing-class submarine suffocated in 2003 when a diesel engine malfunctioned, consuming the vessel's oxygen supply Russia'sKursksubmarine sank in the Barents Sea in 2000 aftera torpedo exploded during an exercise, killing all 118 on board, including 23 who survived the blast but died due to a lack of oxygen TheUSS Scorpionsank in the Atlantic in 1968, possibly because a torpedo exploded, killing the 99 crew TheUSS Threshersank during diving tests in 1963, killing all 129 on board - the biggest submarine death toll in history Russians search for answers after new sea tragedy Battery caused deadly fire on Russian secret sub 'Like Armageddon': Five fires rage in Los Angeles, with whole communities destroyed What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

Toxic caterpillar plague spreads across Europe,"The caterpillars form big clumps and nests on oak trees Germany and the Netherlands are battling many infestations of oak processionary caterpillars, whose tiny toxic hairs can trigger allergic reactions and skin irritation. The mild winter and warm spring this year boosted caterpillar numbers. In Louvain, Belgium, firefighters had to destroy nests of the invasive species before a rock concert. The caterpillars turn into pupae, then moths in late July, and the threat diminishes. Germany's western Ruhr region is densely populated and among the worst affected by the caterpillars. Some schools and parks have been closed to allow specialists to attack the nests in oak trees. The caterpillars - measuring 2-3cm (about one inch) - march in long processions to the treetops at night, and can wreak havoc in oak trees, as they feast on the young leaves. One mature caterpillar has up to 700,000 hairs, which can be spread by the wind. The oak processionary moth pest is known as OPM for short. This video can not be played England, 2018: Experts warn oak processionary moths will keep spreading The Fredenbaumpark in Dortmund was closed for three weeks, as nearly 500 trees were found to be infested there, broadcaster Deutschlandfunk reported. ""The oak processionary infestation this year is very intensive - much more than last year,"" said the park's manager Frank Dartsch. Special teams there and elsewhere have donned protective gear and used firefighters' lifts to reach the treetops, where they have attacked OPM nests with blowtorches or big vacuum cleaners. In the Netherlands, OPM infestations have also increased compared with 2018, with the oak-rich provinces of Noord-Brabant, Drenthe and Overijssel especially affected. A video of an elderly woman attacking the caterpillars with a heat gun in the city of Enschede has gone viral, thenltimes.nl website reports,external. Vasthi Alonso-Chavez, a specialist at Rothamsted Research in the UK, told the BBC that two factors were probably responsible forOPM's spread northwards,external: the trade in oak plants and a warming climate. Broadcaster RTL says the caterpillars have spread all over Luxembourg, a heavily forested country. The Luxembourg City authorities have issued a health warning, as the caterpillars are in the city too. The caterpillars are also infesting the densely wooded French island of Corsica. They were a problem in parts of England last year. Ms Alonso-Chavez says there are established OPM populations mainly in London and surrounding areas. OPM was first identified in London in 2006, she says, and probably arrived as eggs on imported oak plants. Residents warned over toxic caterpillars Invasion of caterpillars closes part of town The BBC's Matt McGrath on Corsican caterpillars: Every time we'd open the shutters in our cosy Corsican forest retreat, we'd find them. Fat and very full of juice from months of gorging on oak leaves, these processionary caterpillars seemed determined to share the house with us. Every day we'd come back and they'd be converging around the doors, eager to get in. Aware of the potential health impacts, we spent a good deal of our time shovelling them up and chucking them back into the trees. But despite their sluggish appearance, the creatures can really shift - turn your back for two minutes and more would appear. Sometimes the first thing you'd know about an encounter was the soft squish underfoot as you stepped on one in the dark.  Relaxing it was not. The owners of the house were not too fussed. It was the second year of a three-year cycle, they explained, and last year was way worse. Reports from Spain say the oak processionary caterpillars are a problem this year in the northern Asturias region. Meanwhile, in and around the city of Valladolid, between Asturias and Madrid, pine processionary caterpillars are a bigger problem. They are a similar species, but their habitat is Mediterranean pines, rather than oaks. The tiny hairs are carried in the wind and contain a toxin, which can cause rashes, eye irritation, coughing or even an allergic reaction. The caterpillar nests are too dangerous to touch. The toxin is thaumetopoein, a protein, and hard to counteract as the hairs have hooks that grip the skin. The anti-inflammatory cortisone can provide relief. Dogs are also vulnerable, as they like to sniff around trees in parks. The caterpillars have some natural predators, including parasites and Calosoma beetles. Few birds, apart from cuckoos and orioles, will touch them. In some parts of Germany eco-friendly pesticides have been sprayed on oak trees. Municipal websites in Germany and elsewhere have some advice: Clothes and personal effects contaminated with hairs should be thoroughly washed Wash yourself thoroughly, including your hair, if you suspect contamination Get medical help if you have skin or respiratory irritation Visible hairs can be removed with strips of adhesive tape Londoners warned over toxic caterpillars Residents warned over toxic caterpillars Invasion of caterpillars closes part of town 'Like Armageddon': Five fires rage in Los Angeles, with whole communities destroyed What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

"Racing pundit McCririck dies aged 79John McCririck, who also appeared on Celebrity Big Brother, was famous for his loud, eccentric style.","McCririck was an award-winning journalist and broadcaster Legendary racing pundit John McCririck, who for many years was the face of British horse racing, has died at a London hospital on Friday aged 79. McCririck made his career as the face of Channel 4's racing coverage, famous for his loud, eccentric style and his signature deerstalker hat. He also appeared on reality TV shows such as Celebrity Big Brother, Celebrity Wife Swap and Celebrity Coach Trip. He is survived by his wife Jenny. His family said he had been ill in recent months but continued to make several TV and radio appearances. Who was John McCririck? Tributes are being paid to John by figures from the worlds of racing and entertainment. ""Very sad to hear the news of John McCririck's passing - one of the most recognisable faces from the world of horse racing and a great at promoting our sport,""tweeted,external20-time champion jockey AP McCoy. Three-time champion jockey Frankie Dettori, 48, said he first met McCririck as a 16-year-old apprentice and the broadcaster was ""a big part of my racing life."" ""He was very flamboyant and controversial but I always got on really well with him,"" said Dettori. ""He did put on a bit of a show but underneath it all he worked very hard and he was very knowledgeable about racing."" The British Horseracing Authority also paid tribute, saying: ""Throughout a lengthy & colourful career one thing was always clear - his enduring passion & love for the sport of horseracing. He was a recognisable figure and resonated with the wider public."" Ascot Racecourse tweeted: ""He was an unmistakable presence in racing, and one of the most impactful broadcasters of his generation."" Broadcaster Nick Luck, a former Channel 4 colleague, added: ""Life without John McCririck will be far less interesting - he was a magnificent journalist first and a great showman. So often very kind to me and many, many others."" McCririck worked for BBC Sport early in his career as a sub-editor on Grandstand when the programme was presented by the likes of Frank Bough and Des Lynam. He went on to write for The Sporting Life where he won British Press Awards 'Specialist Writer of the Year' and 'Campaigning Journalist of the Year'. McCririck's profile grew when he energised racing broadcasts with lively updates from the betting ring, where he was not afraid to berate punters playing the fool in the background. When he was axed by Channel 4 in 2012, he launched a claim for age discrimination. ""I have put my own personal future on the line,"" he said. ""But I think it's so important for people in their 30s up to their 70s who fear anonymous suits and skirts coming along and getting rid of them."" He lost the case, and with it a significant amount of money, although he became a regular on reality TV shows. McCririck would make disparaging remarks about his wife Jenny, nicknaming her 'The Booby', but in truth they were a strong and happy couple. ""It's all a pantomime. Do I look like someone who is downtrodden?"" said Jenny. McCririck was still a regular sight - often smoking a fat cigar - at big race meetings in recent years although ill health meant he missed the Epsom and Royal Ascot fixtures last month. Viewers were shocked when he appeared frail and gaunt during one broadcast, although he retained his humour and ability to generate debate throughout. Cornelius Lysaght, BBC horse racing correspondent With a trademark deerstalker hat, his side whiskers and his waving arms plus a booming voice, McCririck became one of the most familiar faces on British television. A former bookmaker and award-wining journalist, his career took off as the betting specialist on Channel 4 Racing from the mid-1980s. He brought to wider audiences the secret 'tic-tac' communication system of the racecourse betting ring, with its unique terms including 'Burlington Bertie 100 to 30' and 'Double Carpet 33 to 1'. With his controversial views - particularly what was seen as a sexist attitude towards women including his wife Jenny - McCririck was dropped by Channel 4 in 2012. Latterly, he made only occasional TV and media appearances but lost none of his flamboyance. I have lost count of how many times people have come up to me and said 'do you know that mad guy with the whiskers who waves his arms around and shouts on the TV at the races - what's he really like?' The answer was that he was a complex character: a colourful pundit and showman who brought horse racing to a wider audience, but also courted controversy of course. He was a campaigning punters' champion and a generous and supportive colleague. He was practically the definition of the expression 'one-off'.

Government-owned bank 'forging signatures',"Brenda and John Wright believe there is a discrepancy in the signatures on the statements of truth used to evict them Representatives of a government-owned bank are suspected of forging signatures on court documents in repossession cases, the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme has been told. In the US, such practices - on a very large scale - led to billion-dollar fines and millions in compensation. The allegations relate to UK Asset Resolution and loans from Northern Rock, Bradford & Bingley, Mortgage Express, also Lloyds Banking Group. The companies strongly deny the claims. The signatures, of bank officials and legal representatives, are found on documents such as statements of truth and witness statements submitted to the courts as part of repossession proceedings. Adam Brand, a handwriting expert witness in forgery cases, says he has seen dozens of examples provided by online action group the Bank Signature Forgery Campaign. In those cases, he considers it highly likely that different people have been signing under the same name. Conservative MP Charlie Elphicke, who sits on the Treasury Select Committee, said it must investigate. And if proven, it could constitute contempt of court. ""You can be jailed for it,"" he said. ""We need to know how widespread this is."" He said there was ""enough evidence now to suggest this may be not a one-off but a systemic practice"". ""Both Mortgage Express and Lloyds need to cooperate, fully - and hand over the evidence,"" he said. In 2014, Brenda and John Wright - now both in their 70s - were evicted from their rented flat in Southport, Merseyside. There had been a dispute between the bank and the flat's owner over some mortgage arrears and they were served a notice of repossession. Ms Wright said they ""could have had it all paid off within 10 months"" but their offer to pay more rent to help clear the arrears had been declined. Following their eviction, the couple said they saw a ""discrepancy"" in the signatures on documents from legal representatives for Mortgage Express, which appeared to suggest different people had signed over the same name on statements of truth used to evict them. Each of these signatures was attributed to the same person on court documents BBC News has shown them to handwriting expert Adam Brand. He said the ""whole movement and the fluency"" of the signatures looked different. UK Asset Resolution [UKAR] said in a statement that it ""completely rejects the allegation that it has had any involvement in the practice of systemic signature forgery"". A cross-party group of MPs from the All Party Parliamentary Group on Fair Business Banking has now backed the Bank Signature Forgery Campaign. Its founder, Julian Watts - who believes he is also a victim of forged signatures - is looking for evidence he believes will show the practice has occurred routinely in the UK, which banks strongly deny. In the US, banks were fined $25bn (Â£19bn) in 2012 and had to compensate millions of people for being repossessed illegally. Thousands of documents were found to have been signed under one name, Linda Green. Julian Watts claims the practice has happened routinely in the UK, which banks strongly deny Mr Watts said the signature used in actions by Mortgage Express to evict John and Brenda Wright had also been used, under a different name, to evict another tenant, in Gloucester, at about the same time. And, he said, he had now been sent evidence the same signature had been used over different names in 2018 - five years later. ""The likelihood that these different people have such a similar signature is tiny,"" he said. Similar signatures in appearance were used under two different names, Ms D and Ms G UKAR, which rejects the allegations, said that ""treating customers fairly is a priority"". It said it repeatedly asked the BBC to show evidence of the practice, but it had refused to do so. We did not share names of the signatories due to concerns over privacy. A spokesman for Lloyds said: ""We recognise the impact that repossessing a home can have on our customers and are fully committed to doing everything reasonably possible to support mortgage customers in financial difficulty."" It said it did not have enough details to respond to wider allegations of the use of forged signatures, but strongly denied one case in which the BBC provided details.

The signatures, of bank officials and legal representatives, are found on documents such as statements of truth and witness statements submitted to the courts as part of repossession proceedings. Adam Brand, a handwriting expert witness in forgery cases, says he has seen dozens of examples provided by online action group the Bank Signature Forgery Campaign. In those cases, he considers it highly likely that different people have been signing under the same name. Conservative MP Charlie Elphicke, who sits on the Treasury Select Committee, said it must investigate. And if proven, it could constitute contempt of court. ""You can be jailed for it,"" he said. ""We need to know how widespread this is."" He said there was ""enough evidence now to suggest this may be not a one-off but a systemic practice"". ""Both Mortgage Express and Lloyds need to cooperate, fully - and hand over the evidence,"" he said. In 2014, Brenda and John Wright - now both in their 70s - were evicted from their rented flat in Southport, Merseyside. There had been a dispute between the bank and the flat's owner over some mortgage arrears and they were served a notice of repossession. Ms Wright said they ""could have had it all paid off within 10 months"" but their offer to pay more rent to help clear the arrears had been declined. Following their eviction, the couple said they saw a ""discrepancy"" in the signatures on documents from legal representatives for Mortgage Express, which appeared to suggest different people had signed over the same name on statements of truth used to evict them. Each of these signatures was attributed to the same person on court documents BBC News has shown them to handwriting expert Adam Brand. He said the ""whole movement and the fluency"" of the signatures looked different. UK Asset Resolution [UKAR] said in a statement that it ""completely rejects the allegation that it has had any involvement in the practice of systemic signature forgery"". A cross-party group of MPs from the All Party Parliamentary Group on Fair Business Banking has now backed the Bank Signature Forgery Campaign. Its founder, Julian Watts - who believes he is also a victim of forged signatures - is looking for evidence he believes will show the practice has occurred routinely in the UK, which banks strongly deny. In the US, banks were fined $25bn (Â£19bn) in 2012 and had to compensate millions of people for being repossessed illegally. Thousands of documents were found to have been signed under one name, Linda Green. Julian Watts claims the practice has happened routinely in the UK, which banks strongly deny Mr Watts said the signature used in actions by Mortgage Express to evict John and Brenda Wright had also been used, under a different name, to evict another tenant, in Gloucester, at about the same time. And, he said, he had now been sent evidence the same signature had been used over different names in 2018 - five years later. ""The likelihood that these different people have such a similar signature is tiny,"" he said. Similar signatures in appearance were used under two different names, Ms D and Ms G UKAR, which rejects the allegations, said that ""treating customers fairly is a priority"". It said it repeatedly asked the BBC to show evidence of the practice, but it had refused to do so. We did not share names of the signatories due to concerns over privacy. A spokesman for Lloyds said: ""We recognise the impact that repossessing a home can have on our customers and are fully committed to doing everything reasonably possible to support mortgage customers in financial difficulty."" It said it did not have enough details to respond to wider allegations of the use of forged signatures, but strongly denied one case in which the BBC provided details.

Man jailed for grooming 146 children online,"Many of Owain Thomas's victims were aged under 13 An aspiring barrister who used online gaming accounts to befriend children and incite them to commit sexual acts on camera has been jailed. Owain Thomas, 29, of Pontypridd, used nine Facebook profiles and three gaming accounts, persuading some of his 146 victims with gaming credits. He was arrested after he asked a group of young boys aged between seven and 14 to expose themselves at a playground. He was jailed for 10 years at Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court on Friday. Judge Richard Twomlow said he will serve an extra five years on extended licence and described him as ""persistent"" and ""a significant risk to the public"". He pleaded guilty to what police described as an ""unprecedented"" 158 child sex charges atan earlier hearing. The charges included causing or inciting children to engage in sexual activity, and watching sexual activity, possessing indecent photographs and distributing indecent photographs. How sex offender was caught thanks to two boys The court previously heard the Aberystwyth University law graduate used software to adopt the persona of children and pretended to be girls or boys as young as eight in order to incite others into sexual activity. He created fake profiles on popular online games such as Roblox, an online multiplayer game, which has 90 million users worldwide and is marketed at children. Thomas would then share footage he had recorded with other paedophiles. Owain Thomasâ silver Fiat Tipo was captured on CCTV approaching the boys in a Rhondda town He was finally caught after the young boys he targeted at a playground in a small town in Rhondda Cynon Taff told their parents, who then informed police. After tracing him on CCTV, South Wales Police seized Thomas's laptops and devices from his home, and he told an officer: ""That's the one I didn't want you to find"". Officers discovered 110 hours worth of abuse footage. His victims - many of them aged under 13 and some as young as nine - were found to be from south Wales, west Yorkshire, south Yorkshire, Northern Ireland, Lancashire and the USA. Sentencing Thomas, Judge Twomlow told him: ""This may have been through a screen but this was a very real experience for your victims. ""You went as far as you could persuade these children to go. You had multiple identities including pretending to be a nine-year-old girl. ""An occurring theme in this case is your persistence. If you couldn't convince them, you would return and try again. ""Because of the sheer volume and scale of your offences I have no doubt that you are a significant risk to the public and pose a real risk. You are a dangerous offender."" Det Insp Lianne Rees said some parents felt they had ""failed as a parent"" Roblox was launched in 2006 and is a platform which allows users to create their own online games using a design tool. According to the company's website, its most popular games have hundreds of thousands of players a day. It claims that its popularity among users aged eight and upwards has ""exploded"", and that it is ""now one of the top online entertainment platforms for kids and teens"". Players can comment on the games while playing them, and also chat with others. Roblox said it ""doesn't support video or voice chat, and it has extensive chat filters"". Det Insp Lianne Rees said many of the parents ""had no idea"" their children were even accessing some of the social media or gaming sites. ""A lot of the parents expressed quite a lot of guilt. Some even said they felt they failed as a parent to safeguard their child,"" she added. NSPCC Cymru said the ""appalling"" case shows ""once again the grave and increasing dangers that children face online and highlights the need for urgent action"".

Toxic caterpillar plague spreads across EuropeThe wind-blown hairs of oak caterpillars are a health risk in Germany and Benelux countries.Europe,"The caterpillars form big clumps and nests on oak trees Germany and the Netherlands are battling many infestations of oak processionary caterpillars, whose tiny toxic hairs can trigger allergic reactions and skin irritation. The mild winter and warm spring this year boosted caterpillar numbers. In Louvain, Belgium, firefighters had to destroy nests of the invasive species before a rock concert. The caterpillars turn into pupae, then moths in late July, and the threat diminishes. Germany's western Ruhr region is densely populated and among the worst affected by the caterpillars. Some schools and parks have been closed to allow specialists to attack the nests in oak trees. The caterpillars - measuring 2-3cm (about one inch) - march in long processions to the treetops at night, and can wreak havoc in oak trees, as they feast on the young leaves. One mature caterpillar has up to 700,000 hairs, which can be spread by the wind. The oak processionary moth pest is known as OPM for short. This video can not be played England, 2018: Experts warn oak processionary moths will keep spreading The Fredenbaumpark in Dortmund was closed for three weeks, as nearly 500 trees were found to be infested there, broadcaster Deutschlandfunk reported. ""The oak processionary infestation this year is very intensive - much more than last year,"" said the park's manager Frank Dartsch. Special teams there and elsewhere have donned protective gear and used firefighters' lifts to reach the treetops, where they have attacked OPM nests with blowtorches or big vacuum cleaners. In the Netherlands, OPM infestations have also increased compared with 2018, with the oak-rich provinces of Noord-Brabant, Drenthe and Overijssel especially affected. A video of an elderly woman attacking the caterpillars with a heat gun in the city of Enschede has gone viral, thenltimes.nl website reports,external. Vasthi Alonso-Chavez, a specialist at Rothamsted Research in the UK, told the BBC that two factors were probably responsible forOPM's spread northwards,external: the trade in oak plants and a warming climate. Broadcaster RTL says the caterpillars have spread all over Luxembourg, a heavily forested country. The Luxembourg City authorities have issued a health warning, as the caterpillars are in the city too. The caterpillars are also infesting the densely wooded French island of Corsica. They were a problem in parts of England last year. Ms Alonso-Chavez says there are established OPM populations mainly in London and surrounding areas. OPM was first identified in London in 2006, she says, and probably arrived as eggs on imported oak plants. Residents warned over toxic caterpillars Invasion of caterpillars closes part of town The BBC's Matt McGrath on Corsican caterpillars: Every time we'd open the shutters in our cosy Corsican forest retreat, we'd find them. Fat and very full of juice from months of gorging on oak leaves, these processionary caterpillars seemed determined to share the house with us. Every day we'd come back and they'd be converging around the doors, eager to get in. Aware of the potential health impacts, we spent a good deal of our time shovelling them up and chucking them back into the trees. But despite their sluggish appearance, the creatures can really shift - turn your back for two minutes and more would appear. Sometimes the first thing you'd know about an encounter was the soft squish underfoot as you stepped on one in the dark.  Relaxing it was not. The owners of the house were not too fussed. It was the second year of a three-year cycle, they explained, and last year was way worse. Reports from Spain say the oak processionary caterpillars are a problem this year in the northern Asturias region. Meanwhile, in and around the city of Valladolid, between Asturias and Madrid, pine processionary caterpillars are a bigger problem. They are a similar species, but their habitat is Mediterranean pines, rather than oaks. The tiny hairs are carried in the wind and contain a toxin, which can cause rashes, eye irritation, coughing or even an allergic reaction. The caterpillar nests are too dangerous to touch. The toxin is thaumetopoein, a protein, and hard to counteract as the hairs have hooks that grip the skin. The anti-inflammatory cortisone can provide relief. Dogs are also vulnerable, as they like to sniff around trees in parks. The caterpillars have some natural predators, including parasites and Calosoma beetles. Few birds, apart from cuckoos and orioles, will touch them. In some parts of Germany eco-friendly pesticides have been sprayed on oak trees. Municipal websites in Germany and elsewhere have some advice: Clothes and personal effects contaminated with hairs should be thoroughly washed Wash yourself thoroughly, including your hair, if you suspect contamination Get medical help if you have skin or respiratory irritation Visible hairs can be removed with strips of adhesive tape Londoners warned over toxic caterpillars Residents warned over toxic caterpillars Invasion of caterpillars closes part of town 'Like Armageddon': Five fires rage in Los Angeles, with whole communities destroyed What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

"Taxing gifts to loved ones 'should be simplified'Fewer people should pay tax on gifts given before death, under proposals for an inheritance tax overhaul.","Fewer people should have to pay tax on gifts given just before death, under proposals for a major overhaul of the inheritance tax system. At present, when someone dies within seven years of passing on money, property or possessions to loved ones, tax of up to 40% must be paid. The Office of Tax Simplification (OTS) has suggested that this deadline should change to five years. The OTS also said the tax should be made much easier to understand. If the changes are approved by the Treasury, it could affect the finances of those who are financially planning in older age, and their younger relatives - many of whom aresaid to be relying on inheritance. Inheritance Tax,externalis a tax on the estate - the property, money and possessions - of someone who has died. However, no tax is paid if the estate is valued at less than Â£325,000 or if anything above this threshold is left to a husband or wife, civil partner, charity, or a community amateur sports club. Fewer than 25,000 estates are liable for the tax each year. That equates to less than 5% of all deaths. However, 10 times as many estates need to complete and submit forms to check whether they are liable for the tax. Inheritance tax explained The tax is a major political battleground, partly owing to the fact many people are concerned about the tax and find it difficult to understand. In January last year, Chancellor Philip Hammond asked the OTS to carry out a review. Kathryn Cearns, who chairs the OTS, said: ""Although only a small number of people pay inheritance tax each year, a far greater number worry about it. The OTS's packages of recommendations would go some way to achieving the goal of making the tax easier to understand and simpler to comply with."" At present the rules are complicated. Anyone can give away Â£3,000 worth of gifts each tax year without them being added to the value of the estate. If unused, this allowance can be carried over to the following year, up to a maximum of Â£6,000. They can also give up to Â£250 to anyone else. There is yet another allowance for gifting money towards wedding costs. A gift is also generally discarded for tax purposes if it is funded out of income, as opposed to savings. It also proposes that the range of allowances is scrapped and replaced with a single, higher, annual gift allowance. Usually it is the estate which is liable for inheritance tax. However, a recipient of a gift, if the giver has died within seven years, and has already given away more than Â£325,000, could be liable to pay inheritance tax. To add to the complication, the level of tax is determined by the length of time between the gift and death. If the individual does not pay the tax within 12 months, generally because they have already spent it, then the estate of the giver becomes liable. Bill Dodwell, OTS Tax Director, said: ""The taxation of lifetime gifts is widely misunderstood and administratively burdensome."" The rules have not changed since the 1980s, but now the OTS has suggested that the seven-year rule is cut to five years, owing to the difficulty of finding paperwork that goes so far back. Some suggest that scrapping the existing taper system would mean some gift recipients face a larger tax bill. Laura Suter, from investment firm AJ Bell said: ""The suggestion of reducing the seven years down to five and scrapping taper relief entirely looks like a bald tax grab and revenue-raising move. ""Instead the taper could be simplified into a two-step process, for example, or if it is scrapped entirely then the period should be shorter than five years."" The Treasury, which commissioned the report, said it would ""consider the OTS recommendations carefully and will respond in due course"". Some of the other recommendationsin the report,externalcover the link between inheritance tax and capital gains tax. Currently, there is no capital gains tax paid on death and the report suggests that this puts people off passing on assets to the next generation during their lifetime. It said that capital gains tax rules should be changed as a result. Some suggest this could make the system more complicated again. However, it makes no recommendations surrounding one of the most complex areas of inheritance tax - the rules allowing people to leave their family home to their descendants.

Jaguar announces electric car investment in UK,"This video can not be played JLR's boss calls for more charging points Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) is investing hundreds of millions of pounds to build a range of electric vehicles at its Castle Bromwich plant in Birmingham. Initially the plant will produce an electric version of the Jaguar XJ. JLR says the move will help secure the jobs of 2,700 workers at the plant. The news follows January's announcement, when the firm said it would cut 4,500 jobs, with the majority coming from the UK. That followed 1,500 jobs lost in 2018. JLR has not announced when it will launch the battery version of the XJ, but it will replace the petrol and diesel versions which have been made since 1968. The company's chief executive, Professor Ralph Speth, called on the government to put more effort into providing charging points for electric cars. ""The current charging infrastructure is not really sufficient to cover the country, nor the hotspots of the cities,"" he said in an interview with the BBC. ""The government has to govern the process,"" he added. Electric cars 'will not solve transport problem' 'Grave concern' as sales of low emission cars fall Why most people won't buy an electric car JLR's announcement comes a day after a report showed that in June sales of low emission cars had fallen for the first time in more than two years. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said efforts to sell such cars were being undermined by confusing policies and ""premature"" removal of subsidies. In response, the government said its focus on zero emission models had been a success, with registrations of battery electric vehicles up over 60% this year compared with the same period in 2018. According to another report, even if the nation switches to electric vehicles, car use will still need to be curbed. The Centre for Research into Energy Demand Solutions (CREDS) warned that electrifying cars will not address traffic jams, urban sprawl and wasted space for parking. This video can not be played Should I buy an electric car? The investment decision by JLR appears to contradict previous warnings by the firm that investment in the UK would be threatened by Brexit, and in particular a no-deal scenario. However, industry experts say that JLR could not wait to see the outcome of the Brexit, as it needed to update its range of vehicles. ""Given where it is in its product lifecycle it [JLR] has to make this decision. The capacity is at Castle Bromwich and there's research and development nearby as well, so they've basically run out of time on this decision,"" David Bailey, a professor of business economics at Birmingham Business School, told the BBC's Today programme. Car investment slumps on Brexit 'red alert' Jaguar Land Rover confirms 4,500 job cuts He added that without the new investment the Castle Bromwich plant would ""effectively be dead"". The plant also produces the Jaguar XF, XE and F-Type. Business Secretary Greg Clark said: ""Today's announcement is a vote of confidence in the UK automotive industry - protecting thousands of skilled jobs. ""It reflects our determination for the UK to be at the forefront of the development and manufacturing of the next generation of electric vehicles."" JLR is investing to produce an electric version of the XJ model Investment in the UK car industryfell 47% last year from 2017and the country is attracting a tiny fraction of the global investment in electric cars. VW alone is investing Â£70bn in Europe, the US and China. A no-deal Brexit would see new tariffs imposed on components and parts moving between the EU and the UK. Vauxhall's parent company said that without a deal it would not make the next generation Astra at Ellesmere Port.

California hit by biggest earthquake in 20 years,"This video can not be played Southern California earthquake wrecks homes and businesses Southern California was hit by its strongest earthquake in two decades on Thursday. The epicentre of the 6.4 magnitude tremor was near the city of Ridgecrest, which is about 150 miles (240 km) north-east of Los Angeles. Tremors continued to be felt on Friday, as emergency crews fought fires and provided medical assistance to people. The quake was felt from Las Vegas in Nevada to Los Angeles on California's Pacific coast. It hit at 10:33 local time (18:33GMT) on the US Fourth of July Independence Day holiday. On Friday morning at 04:15, a tremor measuring 5.4 struck. Los Angeles fire officials said there were no immediate reports of additional damage. There was significant damage in Ridgecrest, which lies south-west of the epicentre, local geophysicist Professor John Rundle told the BBC. The epicentre of the earthquake was near the city of Ridgecrest He added that it was fortunate the quake had happened far away from major population centres. Roads were cracked and broken and power lines fell to the ground after the earthquake, which also shattered glass and cracked the walls of some homes in the region. Fire burned some homes in the city of Ridgecrest The Ridgecrest Regional Hospital was evacuated, the Kern County Fire Department said. The service has responded to nearly two dozen incidents ranging from medical assistance for minor injuries to fires. The quake also struck near China Lake - the bomb testing facility of the US Navy, where weapons and aircraft are put to through their paces. One official from the facility told AFP news agency there was ""substantial damage"" â including fires, water leaks, and hazardous materials spills. Brad Alexander, a spokesman for California Governor's Office of Emergency Services, said on Thursday that fire engines and search and rescue teams were going to assist in the Ridgecrest area, where he believed there were a number of buildings on fire. ""This may not be over. There could be more earthquakes happening in the area and anyone listening that's in that region should be prepared to drop, cover and hold on,"" he warned. A man cleans up a supermarket that was damaged by the earthquake Governor of California Gavin Newsom declared an emergency for the areas affected, as concern for potential aftershocks ramped up. In interviews, he called on California residents to have a plan in place in case more earthquakes strike. Mayor of Ridgecrest Peggy Breeden said that some people had been struck by objects falling from buildings and gas lines had been broken. ""We are used to earthquakes but we're not used to this significance,"" she said. Los Angeles' early warning system did not send an advance alert to many residents in the region,the LA Times reports - because the forecast did not meet the threshold of severity for Los Angeles County,external. In the end, the shaking was worse than expected for some people. Stephen Sykes, who lives in Ridgecrest, was in the shower when his house started to shake. ""The whole house shook violently and we both ran out into the street. This went on for about 10 to 15 seconds, we were really scared,"" he told the BBC. ""Currently we are getting ready in case there's another one. We are moving items onto the floor and have turned off the gas supply. We will probably sleep outside tonight,"" he added.

Taxing gifts to loved ones 'should be simplified',"Fewer people should have to pay tax on gifts given just before death, under proposals for a major overhaul of the inheritance tax system. At present, when someone dies within seven years of passing on money, property or possessions to loved ones, tax of up to 40% must be paid. The Office of Tax Simplification (OTS) has suggested that this deadline should change to five years. The OTS also said the tax should be made much easier to understand. If the changes are approved by the Treasury, it could affect the finances of those who are financially planning in older age, and their younger relatives - many of whom aresaid to be relying on inheritance. Inheritance Tax,externalis a tax on the estate - the property, money and possessions - of someone who has died. However, no tax is paid if the estate is valued at less than Â£325,000 or if anything above this threshold is left to a husband or wife, civil partner, charity, or a community amateur sports club. Fewer than 25,000 estates are liable for the tax each year. That equates to less than 5% of all deaths. However, 10 times as many estates need to complete and submit forms to check whether they are liable for the tax. Inheritance tax explained The tax is a major political battleground, partly owing to the fact many people are concerned about the tax and find it difficult to understand. In January last year, Chancellor Philip Hammond asked the OTS to carry out a review. Kathryn Cearns, who chairs the OTS, said: ""Although only a small number of people pay inheritance tax each year, a far greater number worry about it. The OTS's packages of recommendations would go some way to achieving the goal of making the tax easier to understand and simpler to comply with."" At present the rules are complicated. Anyone can give away Â£3,000 worth of gifts each tax year without them being added to the value of the estate. If unused, this allowance can be carried over to the following year, up to a maximum of Â£6,000. They can also give up to Â£250 to anyone else. There is yet another allowance for gifting money towards wedding costs. A gift is also generally discarded for tax purposes if it is funded out of income, as opposed to savings. It also proposes that the range of allowances is scrapped and replaced with a single, higher, annual gift allowance. Usually it is the estate which is liable for inheritance tax. However, a recipient of a gift, if the giver has died within seven years, and has already given away more than Â£325,000, could be liable to pay inheritance tax. To add to the complication, the level of tax is determined by the length of time between the gift and death. If the individual does not pay the tax within 12 months, generally because they have already spent it, then the estate of the giver becomes liable. Bill Dodwell, OTS Tax Director, said: ""The taxation of lifetime gifts is widely misunderstood and administratively burdensome."" The rules have not changed since the 1980s, but now the OTS has suggested that the seven-year rule is cut to five years, owing to the difficulty of finding paperwork that goes so far back. Some suggest that scrapping the existing taper system would mean some gift recipients face a larger tax bill. Laura Suter, from investment firm AJ Bell said: ""The suggestion of reducing the seven years down to five and scrapping taper relief entirely looks like a bald tax grab and revenue-raising move. ""Instead the taper could be simplified into a two-step process, for example, or if it is scrapped entirely then the period should be shorter than five years."" The Treasury, which commissioned the report, said it would ""consider the OTS recommendations carefully and will respond in due course"". Some of the other recommendationsin the report,externalcover the link between inheritance tax and capital gains tax. Currently, there is no capital gains tax paid on death and the report suggests that this puts people off passing on assets to the next generation during their lifetime. It said that capital gains tax rules should be changed as a result. Some suggest this could make the system more complicated again. However, it makes no recommendations surrounding one of the most complex areas of inheritance tax - the rules allowing people to leave their family home to their descendants. The rule for scrapping inheritance tax on homes up to Â£1m wasa major policyof the David Cameron Conservative government. How are the inheritance tax rules changing?

How I became a victim of a modern slavery gang,"Mariusz Rycaczewksi was trafficked to the UK from Poland Eight human traffickers have been jailed following the UK's biggest ever modern slavery prosecution. The five men and three women, who were members of a Polish organised crime group, enslaved hundreds of desperate and vulnerable people. They promised their victims a better life before robbing them - embroiling high street banks, employment agencies and some of Britain's biggest companies in a vast web of criminal exploitation. BBC Panorama has been following the investigation for two years. ""Worst thing I ever did [was] leaving the Foreign Legion,"" says Mariusz Rykaczewski. ""Two more years and I'd have got a pension."" The former soldier does not look like a victim. But desperate for a way out of Poland, he fell for the false promises of a slave gang. ""I was in trouble with the police,"" he told Panorama, ""I wanted to get away to another country. But I didn't have the money to travel."" He was approached by two men who offered him free travel, housing and work in the UK: ""I think, 'it's a joke',"" he says. ""Then they called me the next day and I thought, 'why not?''' Marek Brzezinski, Julianna Chodakowicz and Marek Chowaniec (from left to right) were sentenced after the first trial But once in the UK he was enslaved, robbed, beaten, starved and humiliated. The gang who exploited him are the largest to have been successfully prosecuted in Europe. Mariusz waived his legal right to anonymity so he can tell his story. He doesn't want others to suffer as he did. ""I want them to pay for what they did,"" says Mariusz. ""I am not frightened. Not any more."" It took the police and Crown Prosecution Service nearly four years to bring the case to trial. Mariusz was one of 66 witnesses to provide evidence to Birmingham Crown Court. Jurors had to consider evidence distilled from 250,000 pages in two cases lasting around six months. Lead prosecutor Caroline Haughey QC described the investigation as ""the largest human trafficking case ever"". ""It is taking down a very large organised crime group and gouging out its heart,"" she says. Natalia Zmuda and Justyna Parczewska (from left to right) were also convicted in the first trial The gang are mainly Roma, from Poland. They came to the UK specifically to traffic their fellow countrymen. Five members were convicted in February, it can now be reported. Julianna Chodakowicz, 24, Marek Brzezinski, 50, Marek Chowaniec, 30, Justyna Parczewska, 48, and Natalia Zmuda, 29, were sentenced to a total of 35 years - a record for a human trafficking case. They were jailed for between four-and-a-half and 11 years. A further three men: Ignacy Brzezinski, 53, Jan Sadowski, 28, and Wojciech Nowakowski, 42, have now been sentenced following a second trial. Brzezinski and Nowakowski were both found guilty of modern slavery offences and were sentenced to 11 years and six-and-a-half years in prison respectively. Sadowski admitted his part on the first day of trial and was sentenced to three years. As well as exploiting the slaves for labour, the gang used their identities to commit both benefit and bank fraud. ""The multiplicity of criminality is extraordinary,"" says Ms Haughey. ""The victims are there to be exploited in any way they can be."" ""The predominance of our complainants are homeless, financially impecunious, desperate for security. Many have mental health problems. Many are alcoholics or drug addicts."" Wojciech Nowakowski, Jan Sadowski and Ignacy Brzezinski (from left to right) were convicted following the second trial The traffickers enticed victims to the UK with bus tickets and the promise of well-paid work. Once here they were taken to squalid terraced houses in West Bromwich and Birmingham. They were held, jobless, under guard for weeks while the debts piled up. Every cigarette, every bit of stale food they were given was added to the tally. Slowly, steadily, they were ensnared. ""That is the isolation phase,"" says Detective Chief Inspector Nick Dale. ""Later, there are threats. The feeling that the traffickers are all-seeing: 'If they leave the house we will find you; you'll go to the woods, and we'll dig a hole'."" Police evidence photos showed mattresses that looked as if they have been dragged in off the street for slaves to sleep on. Their rooms were cramped and filthy. ""One man described washing with canal water,"" says Ms Haughey. ""Others described eating out of skips because the food was so bad. It's heart-breaking."" Mariusz says the traffickers also supplied the slaves with drink, plunging them further into debt and making the victims more compliant. ""It was always noisy in the house, crazy,"" he recalls. ""There was no place you could go. And they were always watching you."" Lead prosecutor Caroline Haughey QC described the investigation as 'the largest ever human trafficking case' Jurors heard how traffickers placed moles inside employment agencies so they could get their slaves into work. Julianna Chodakowicz was employed by E-Response in Worcestershire. It supplied 23 workers to a fencing company that supplies major DIY retailers. Chodakowicz had been in a relationship with another member - Marek Chowaniec - who brought slaves into the country. The well-ordered hierarchy Chowaniec worked to included family head Ignacy Brzezinski and Justyna Parczewska - the gang's matriarch. When a slave died of natural causes, she ordered a gang enforcer to empty his pockets before calling the authorities. The rest of those convicted were minders and so-called ""foot soldiers"" who controlled slaves in the houses. ""Every day we travelled 90 minutes to work. I was picking vegetables in the rain,"" says Mariusz. ""No toilet facilities, no shower in the house. On Friday, the trafficker comes round and pays me - sometimes Â£40, sometimes Â£25. The most I got was Â£75. ""The traffickers opened bank accounts in everybody's name - with an address they control."" 'I was kidnapped in London and trafficked for sex' Latvian gang admits human trafficking in Derby Modern slavery: What has Theresa May done to tackle it? Many of the slaves were forced to open multiple accounts. Detectives identified a total of 81. These were regularly emptied by the traffickers. CCTV obtained by the police shows gang leaders making multiple withdrawals using a stack of bank cards. When Mariusz complained to his captors, the response was violent. ""They beat me,"" he says. ""Punched and kicked me. Broke my ribs. Gave me black eyes. I slept with a knife under my pillow in case they came again."" Desperate to escape, Mariusz got a number for the Salvation Army slavery helpline. It hums around the clock, taking calls from the victims of modern slavery. Staff are trained to help people break free. ""The woman, she told me what to do,"" says Mariusz. ""One night I just left the house and ran to the nearest police station."" Mariusz was interviewed and taken to a Salvation Army safe house. The charity has a government contract to help slaves and rehabilitate them. Last year it cared for 3,354 people. The numbers it deals with have risen every year for the past seven years. The Salvation Army and anti-slavery charity, Hope for Justice, work closely with the police. One of its workers noticed that many men were turning up at its soup kitchen in West Bromwich with the same story as Mariusz. ""We started rescuing them one by one,"" says Kevin, a former detective working with the charity. ""We arranged rendezvous points close to where they were living and picked them up. They were all terrified."" Police video interviews with the escaped slaves capture their terror. One after another they describe beatings, exploitation and humiliation. The only woman known to have been enslaved by the gang sits in a red parka, her arms clamped between her legs, as she relates a trafficker's threat to her: ""He said, 'I will break your bones',"" she tells detectives. He also threatened to sell her into prostitution if she refused to comply. The striking thing about all of the accounts is how similar they are. ""The stories sit on top of one another in layers,"" says Ms Haughey. ""There are thousands upon thousands of documents in this case, but they tell a single story."" In spite of the successful prosecutions, DCI Dale warns that it would be wrong to imagine that the conviction of this gang brings the problem to an end. ""We cannot police it out of existence,"" he says. ""We need the public, employers and banks to act if they see something suspicious. Not to turn a blind eye. ' Mariusz's evidence was crucial to these prosecutions. But things have not ended well for the former Foreign Legionary. The crime that drove him into the traffickers' arms has finally caught up with him. Hearing he was in the UK, Polish prosecutors issued a European Arrest Warrant for him. He has now been deported to Poland to serve a year-long sentence. ""It's okay. I have been through worse,"" he told the programme, on the day of his extradition. ""I will be fine.""

"China separating Muslim children from familiesThousands of ethnic minority Muslim children undergo ""cultural re-engineering"" in giant boarding schools.China","This video can not be played The BBC's John Sudworth meets Uighur parents in Turkey who say their children are missing in China China is deliberately separating Muslim children from their families, faith and language in its far western region of Xinjiang, according to new research. At the same time as hundreds of thousands of adults are being detained in giant camps, a rapid, large-scale campaign to build boarding schools is under way. Based on publicly available documents, and backed up by dozens of interviews with family members overseas, the BBC has gathered some of the most comprehensive evidence to date about what is happening to children in the region. Records show that in one township alone more than 400 children have lost not just one but both parents to some form of internment, either in the camps or in prison. Formal assessments are carried out to determine whether the children are in need of ""centralised care"". Alongside the efforts to transform the identity of Xinjiang's adults, the evidence points to a parallel campaign to systematically remove children from their roots. The Hotan Kindness Kindergarten, like many others, is a high security facility China's tight surveillance and control in Xinjiang, where foreign journalists are followed 24 hours a day, make it impossible to gather testimony there. But it can be found in Turkey. In a large hall in Istanbul, dozens of people queue to tell their stories, many of them clutching photographs of children, all now missing back home in Xinjiang. ""I don't know who is looking after them,"" one mother says, pointing to a picture of her three young daughters, ""there is no contact at all."" Another mother, holding a photo of three sons and a daughter, wipes away her tears. ""I heard that they've been taken to an orphanage,"" she says. In 60 separate interviews, in wave after wave of anxious, grief-ridden testimony, parents and other relatives give details of the disappearance in Xinjiang of more than 100 children. They are all Uighurs - members of Xinjiang's largest, predominantly Muslim ethnic group that has long had ties of language and faith to Turkey. Thousands have come to study or to do business, to visit family, or to escape China's birth control limits and the increasing religious repression. But over the past three years, they have found themselves trapped after China began detaining hundreds of thousands of Uighurs and other minorities in giant camps. China's hidden camps: The vanished Uighurs of Xinjiang 'I spent seven days of hell in Chinese camps' China's Muslim 'crackdown' explained The Chinese authorities say the Uighurs are being educated in ""vocational training centres"" in order to combat violent religious extremism. But evidence shows that many are being detained for simply expressing their faith - praying or wearing a veil - or for having overseas connections to places like Turkey. For these Uighurs, going back means almost certain detention. Phone contact has been severed - even speaking to relatives overseas is now too dangerous for those in Xinjiang. With his wife detained back home, one father tells me he fears some of his eight children may now be in the care of the Chinese state. ""I think they've been taken to child education camps,"" he says. New research commissioned by the BBC sheds light on what is really happening to these children and many thousands of others. Dr Adrian Zenz is a German researcher widely credited with exposing the full extent of China's mass detentions of adult Muslims in Xinjiang. Based on publicly available official documents, hisreport paints a picture of an unprecedented school expansion drive,externalin Xinjiang. Campuses have been enlarged, new dormitories built and capacity increased on a massive scale. Significantly, the state has been growing its ability to care full-time for large numbers of children at precisely the same time as it has been building the detention camps. And it appears to be targeted at precisely the same ethnic groups. In just one year, 2017, the total number of children enrolled in kindergartens in Xinjiang increased by more than half a million. And Uighur and other Muslim minority children, government figures show, made up more than 90% of that increase. As a result, Xinjiang's pre-school enrolment level has gone from below the national average to the highest in China by far. In the south of Xinjiang alone, an area with the highest concentration of Uighur populations, the authorities have spent an eye watering $1.2bn on the building and upgrading of kindergartens. Mr Zenz's analysis suggests that this construction boom has included the addition of large amounts of dormitory space. Xinhe County Youyi Kindergarten has space for 700 children, 80% of whom are from Xinjiang's minority groups Xinjiang's education expansion is driven, it appears, by the same ethos as underlies the mass incarceration of adults. And it is clearly affecting almost all Uighur and other minority children, whether their parents are in the camps or not. In 2018 work began on a site for two new boarding schools in Xinjiang's southern city of Yecheng (known as Kargilik in Uighur). Yecheng County Middle Schools 10 and 11 Dragging the slider reveals the pace of construction - the two middle schools, separated by a shared sports field, are each three times larger than the national average and were built in little more than a year. In April last year, the county authorities relocated 2,000 children from the surrounding villages into yet another giant boarding middle school, Yecheng County Number 4. Government propaganda extols the virtues of boarding schools as helping to ""maintain social stability and peace"" with the ""school taking the place of the parents."" And Mr Zenz suggests there is a deeper purpose. ""Boarding schools provide the ideal context for a sustained cultural re-engineering of minority societies,"" he argues. Just as with the camps, his research shows that there is now a concerted drive to all but eliminate the use of Uighur and other local languages from school premises. Individual school regulations outline strict, points-based punishments for both students and teachers if they speak anything other than Chinese while in school. And this aligns with other official statements claiming that Xinjiang has already achieved full Chinese language teaching in all of its schools. This video can not be played The BBC visits the camps where Chinaâs Muslims have their ""thoughts transformed"" Speaking to the BBC, Xu Guixiang, a senior official with Xinjiang's Propaganda Department, denies that the state is having to care for large numbers of children left parentless as a result. ""If all family members have been sent to vocational training then that family must have a severe problem,"" he says, laughing. ""I've never seen such a case."" But perhaps the most significant part of Mr Zenz's work is his evidence that shows that the children of detainees are indeed being channelled into the boarding school system in large numbers. Searching for truth in China's 're-education' camps Why is there tension between China and the Uighurs? China's Muslim camp spending 'revealed' There are the detailed forms used by local authorities to log the situations of children with parents in vocational training or in prison, and to determine whether they need centralised care. Mr Zenz found one government document that details various subsidies available to ""needy groups"", including those families where ""both a husband and a wife are in vocational training"". And a directive issued to education bureaus by the city of Kashgar that mandates them to look after the needs of students with parents in the camps as a matter of urgency. Schools should ""strengthen psychological counselling"", the directive says, and ""strengthen students' thought education"" - a phrase that finds echoes in the camps holding their parents. It is clear that the effect of the mass internments on children is now viewed as a significant societal issue, and that some effort is going into dealing with it, although it is not something the authorities are keen to publicise. This video can not be played The BBC has found new evidence of the increasing control and suppression of Islam in China Some of the relevant government documents appear to have been deliberately hidden from search engines by using obscure symbols in place of the term ""vocational training"". That said, in some instances the adult detention camps have kindergartens built close by, and, when visiting, Chinese state media reporters have extolled their virtues. These boarding schools, they say, allow minority children to learn ""better life habits"" and better personal hygiene than they would at home. Some children have begun referring to their teachers as ""mummy"". We telephoned a number of local Education Bureaus in Xinjiang to try to find out about the official policy in such cases. Most refused to speak to us, but some gave brief insights into the system. We asked one official what happens to the children of those parents who have been taken to the camps. ""They're in boarding schools,"" she replied. ""We provide accommodation, food and clothesâ¦ and we've been told by the senior level that we must look after them well."" Hotan Sunshine Kindergarten, seen through a wire fence In the hall in Istanbul, as the stories of broken families come tumbling out, there is raw despair and deep resentment too. ""Thousands of innocent children are being separated from their parents and we are giving our testimonies constantly,"" one mother tells me. ""Why does the world keep silent when knowing these facts?"" Back in Xinjiang, the research shows that all children now find themselves in schools that are secured with ""hard isolation closed management measures."" Many of the schools bristle with full-coverage surveillance systems, perimeter alarms and 10,000 Volt electric fences, with some school security spending surpassing that of the camps. The policy was issued in early 2017, at a time when the detentions began to be dramatically stepped up. Was the state, Mr Zenz wonders, seeking to pre-empt any possibility on the part of Uighur parents to forcibly recover their children? ""I think the evidence for systematically keeping parents and children apart is a clear indication that Xinjiang's government is attempting to raise a new generation cut off from original roots, religious beliefs and their own language,"" he tells me. ""I believe the evidence points to what we must call cultural genocide."" Searching for truth in China's 're-education' camps China's vanishing beards and mosques.

Government-owned bank 'forging signatures'A government-owned bank is accused of forging signatures on court documents in repossession proceedings.Business,"Brenda and John Wright believe there is a discrepancy in the signatures on the statements of truth used to evict them Representatives of a government-owned bank are suspected of forging signatures on court documents in repossession cases, the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme has been told. In the US, such practices - on a very large scale - led to billion-dollar fines and millions in compensation. The allegations relate to UK Asset Resolution and loans from Northern Rock, Bradford & Bingley, Mortgage Express, also Lloyds Banking Group. The companies strongly deny the claims. The signatures, of bank officials and legal representatives, are found on documents such as statements of truth and witness statements submitted to the courts as part of repossession proceedings. Adam Brand, a handwriting expert witness in forgery cases, says he has seen dozens of examples provided by online action group the Bank Signature Forgery Campaign. In those cases, he considers it highly likely that different people have been signing under the same name. Conservative MP Charlie Elphicke, who sits on the Treasury Select Committee, said it must investigate. And if proven, it could constitute contempt of court. ""You can be jailed for it,"" he said. ""We need to know how widespread this is."" He said there was ""enough evidence now to suggest this may be not a one-off but a systemic practice"". ""Both Mortgage Express and Lloyds need to cooperate, fully - and hand over the evidence,"" he said. In 2014, Brenda and John Wright - now both in their 70s - were evicted from their rented flat in Southport, Merseyside. There had been a dispute between the bank and the flat's owner over some mortgage arrears and they were served a notice of repossession. Ms Wright said they ""could have had it all paid off within 10 months"" but their offer to pay more rent to help clear the arrears had been declined. Following their eviction, the couple said they saw a ""discrepancy"" in the signatures on documents from legal representatives for Mortgage Express, which appeared to suggest different people had signed over the same name on statements of truth used to evict them. Each of these signatures was attributed to the same person on court documents BBC News has shown them to handwriting expert Adam Brand. He said the ""whole movement and the fluency"" of the signatures looked different. UK Asset Resolution [UKAR] said in a statement that it ""completely rejects the allegation that it has had any involvement in the practice of systemic signature forgery"". A cross-party group of MPs from the All Party Parliamentary Group on Fair Business Banking has now backed the Bank Signature Forgery Campaign. Its founder, Julian Watts - who believes he is also a victim of forged signatures - is looking for evidence he believes will show the practice has occurred routinely in the UK, which banks strongly deny. In the US, banks were fined $25bn (Â£19bn) in 2012 and had to compensate millions of people for being repossessed illegally. Thousands of documents were found to have been signed under one name, Linda Green. Julian Watts claims the practice has happened routinely in the UK, which banks strongly deny Mr Watts said the signature used in actions by Mortgage Express to evict John and Brenda Wright had also been used, under a different name, to evict another tenant, in Gloucester, at about the same time. And, he said, he had now been sent evidence the same signature had been used over different names in 2018 - five years later. ""The likelihood that these different people have such a similar signature is tiny,"" he said. Similar signatures in appearance were used under two different names, Ms D and Ms G UKAR, which rejects the allegations, said that ""treating customers fairly is a priority"". It said it repeatedly asked the BBC to show evidence of the practice, but it had refused to do so. We did not share names of the signatories due to concerns over privacy. A spokesman for Lloyds said: ""We recognise the impact that repossessing a home can have on our customers and are fully committed to doing everything reasonably possible to support mortgage customers in financial difficulty."" It said it did not have enough details to respond to wider allegations of the use of forged signatures, but strongly denied one case in which the BBC provided details.

"Electric cars 'will not solve transport problem'Car use will still need to be curbed, even when all vehicles use clean electricity, a report warns.","Car use will still need to be curbed even when all vehicles are powered by clean electricity, a report has said. It warns that electrifying cars will not address traffic jams, urban sprawl and wasted space for parking. The Centre for Research into Energy Demand Solutions (CREDS) report calls on the government to devise a strategy allowing people to have a good standard of living without needing a car. The government said it was spending Â£2bn to promote walking and cycling. It also says it plans to spend Â£50bn on improving roads. However, critics accuse the government of not having a serious plan to deal with the social problems associated with mass car ownership. CREDS is an academic consortium of more than 80 academics across the UK. ""Car use is a massive blind spot on government policy,"" Prof Jillian Anable, one of the authors of the report, said. She added: âFor many years ministers have adopted the principle of trying to meet demand by increasing road space. ""They need to reduce demand instead.â What's your diet's carbon footprint? What is a climate emergency? How can I help? The authors say there will always be people who depend on cars, especially in the countryside or suburbs. But, they point out that many young people in cities are choosing not to buy cars. Instead they are using public transport, walking, cycling, taking minicabs and hiring cars when they are needed. This video can not be played Should I buy an electric car? This more active lifestyle means less obesity, pollution and road danger â and greater sociability as people meet their neighbours on their way to work. It also allows parking spaces to be liberated for more housing or gardens. The government, the authors say, should be encouraging other people to follow the lead set by the young. âIt is a happy accident that car ownership is static in every age group except the over-60s,"" Prof Anable says. ""The government should build on that.â She maintains car ownership is wasteful because cars are parked for 98% of their lifetime, with a third of cars not going out every day. âOnce you own a car,â she says, âthere is a compelling temptation to use it even for simple journeys. âBut it is a really expensive investment. If people do not have cars they can spend the money on other things. âOften once people start to live without a car they wonder why they wanted one in the first place â a car is so much hassle.â She says ministers should prioritise walking, cycling, public transport and vehicle-sharing wherever possible. They should also incentivise local councils to build housing developments that are easy to access without a car. That would also benefit the 25% of households that do not have cars. The report supports government efforts tophase out petrol and diesel cars in the move towards Net Zero emissions. But it says the timetable is too slow, and may not be achieved anyway. Sales of low emission cars fell in the UK for the first time in two years, the industry has said There is a huge challenge in charging vehicles â especially in urban areas with no off-street parking. What is more, drivers tend to be choosing hybrid vehicles rather than pure electric cars â and that will lock in fossil fuel usage into the future. People are also buying status-symbol SUVs which clog up narrow city streets - the report says banning them from some areas might be a solution. The other great technological change under way on the roads is driverless cars. The report warns this dream could also turn sour as car owners may choose to live many miles from their workplace, using their car as a mobile office while sitting in traffic jams they have helped to create. The AAâs president Edmund King agrees electric driverless cars could make congestion worse. He told us: âOne vision of hell is that the driverless car turns up in the city centre where there is no parking. ""The occupant gets out to do their business, whilst the car just continues driving around for hours on end until beckoned back by the user.â He suggests perhaps switching vehicle taxation away from petrol and diesel and on to Road Miles â a charge for the miles you drive, imposed electronically. A spokesperson for the Department for Transport said: ""We are committed to future-proofing our towns and cities for journeys which reduce traffic, encourage healthy exercise, tackle carbon emissions and improve air quality. âThis year, we launched the biggest regulatory review in a generation to ensure we are ready to take advantage of new technologies which can help achieve this. ""We are also helping more people choose cleaner, greener forms of transport by investing around Â£2bn in active travel over the course of this Parliament."" Labour MP Lilian Greenwood called on the government to set targets for 'getting people out of cars' But, Labour's Lilian Greenwood, chair of the Commons Transport Committee, believes ministers must do more. She said: âThe move to electric vehicles is most definitely not a panacea and fails to address wider concerns about public health and the kind of places where we want to live. ""Congestion is a costly blight in many urban areas and there is a real risk that we will end up swapping dirty, polluting traffic jams for clean, green ones. ""Inactivity and obesity are increasingly serious public health problems. Getting people out of their cars is essential, yet the government has no targets for such a shift - my committee has called for that to change.""

Boris Johnson: A history of undiplomacy,"Boris isn't quite this affectionate with Trump: he has accused him of ""stupefying ignorance"" In case you have just emerged from a desert island or a long sleep: the UK has a new prime minister, Theresa May, who in turn has appointed a new foreign secretary. The man who will be representing Britain's interests abroad is Boris Johnson. Yes, that Boris Johnson, the tousle-haired, barrel-bellied engineer of the UK's exit from the EU. It's an appointment that's been treatedwith some shock around the world- not least because he has been less than diplomatic about other countries and their leaders before. Some of his positions, often outlined in his newspaper columns, also risk clashing with his own government's official stance. Meet Britain's new representative on the world stage On Tony Blair visiting Africa,in 2002,external: ""What a relief it must be for Blair to get out of England. It is said that the Queen has come to love the Commonwealth, partly because it supplies her with regular cheering crowds of flag-waving piccaninnies... ""They say he is shortly off to the Congo. No doubt the AK47s will fall silent, and the pangas will stop their hacking of human flesh, and the tribal warriors will all break out in watermelon smiles to see the big white chief touch down in his big white British taxpayer-funded bird."" Mr Johnson apologised for the comments in 2008, during his successful campaign to be mayor of London. But it'snot the only time,externalhe has used the term ""piccaninnies"", a derogatory word for black children. On the effects of colonialism in Uganda(in 2002),external: ""If left to their own devices, the natives would rely on nothing but the instant carbohydrate gratification of the plantain."" On Barack Obama's decision to remove a bust of Winston Churchill from the Oval Office(in March this year) ""No one was sure whether the President had himself been involved in the decision. Some said it was a snub to Britain. Some said it was a symbol of the part-Kenyan President's ancestral dislike of the British empire - of which Churchill had been such a fervent defender."" Mr Obama thenspoke outover Mr Johnson's comments. Mr Johnson's poem refers to a goat, that's all we're saying Earlier this year, Turkey pushed for the prosecution of a German comedianwho composed an obscene poemabout President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. In response, the British magazine The Spectator ran a competition asking readers to submit an offensive poem about Mr Erdogan - a competition won by Mr Johnson. While we can't print the poem in full, you canread it here,external- suffice to say, it includes a creative rhyme for ""Ankara"". Mr Johnson has Turkish ancestry - but that is something he's been advised against exploiting. Pro-government newspaper commentator Selim Atala tweeted: ""Dear @BorisJohnson I understand you need well-versed apologies in Turkish. I can help you with that. PS: Turkish roots-card won't work."" After Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's troops, bolstered by Russian forces, reclaimed the ancient city of Palmyra from the self-styled Islamic State group, Mr Johnsonwas fulsome in his praise,external. He wrote that ""any sane person should feel a sense of satisfaction at what Assad's troops have accomplished"", but maintained that Assad was ""a monster, a dictator"". Dobby the House Elf, presented without comment In a column last December, Mr Johnsoncompared Vladimir Putin to Dobby the House Elf,external, the Harry Potter character. While criticising Mr Putin, he has also praised his role in Russia and called for more co-operation with Moscow. (Mr Johnson's predecessor as foreign secretary, Philip Hammond, had criticised Russia for targeting civilians by bombing hospitals and schools in Syria.) In May, Mr Johnson also called into question the EU's role in the conflict in eastern Ukraine, where Russia is widely accused of backing the rebels who control much of the region. ""If you want an example of EU foreign policymaking on the hoof and the EU's pretensions to running a defence policy that have caused real trouble, then look at what has happened in Ukraine,"" he told reporters. On Thursday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said he hoped Mr Johnson's appointment would signal a new start for UK-Russia ties. Reminded of Mr Johnson's comments, Mr Peskov said: ""The weight of his current position will certainly, probably, provoke a different kind of rhetoric of a more diplomatic character."" Travelling to a country on a trade visit and responding byviolently flattening a 10-year-old boyis perhaps not diplomacy at its greatest. This video can not be played Boris Johnson apologised to the boy afterwards His new role will inevitably take him to meet officials in the country of his birth, and to deal with its next president. Only one problem there (depending on who wins the election in November)... Boris on Hillary Clinton ""She's got dyed blonde hair and pouty lips, and a steely blue stare, like a sadistic nurse in a mental hospital."" -in 2007,external Boris on Donald Trump ""I am genuinely worried that he could become president,""Mr Johnson said in March,external. ""I was in New York and some photographers were trying to take a picture of me and a girl walked down the pavement towards me and she stopped and she said, 'Gee, is that Trump?' ""It was one of the worst moments."" He's also accused Mr Trump of being ""out of his mind"" and of possessing ""stupefying ignorance"". Ina 2006 column,external, he said he supported Iran having the nuclear bomb, saying it was ""the the only sure-fire means of protecting my country, and my poor huddled constituents...from the possibility of an attack by America."" While he acknowledges this was at a time the US was fighting two wars, it's fair to say Mr Johnson's opinion here is... unconventional. Some things never change: in 2006, the Labour party was (again) in the middle of another leadership crisis. And Boris was (again) apologising for more offensive comments - this time in relation to Labour's troubles. He wrote: ""For 10 years we in the Tory Party have become used to Papua New Guinea-style orgies of cannibalism and chief-killing, and so it is with a happy amazement that we watch as the madness engulfs the Labour Party."" Papua New Guinea's High Commissioner in Londonwas not happy,external. Staff at the Foreign Office may have their hands full, if one report is anything to go by. ""Foreign Office staff had to pick up a hotel bar tab, stop Mr Johnson from driving a sports car out of a showroom and arrange last-minute tours when the mayor of London travelled to Erbil, in the semi-autonomous region of Iraqi Kurdistan, in January 2015,""the FT reported,external. While his visit did lead to more deals struck in Kurdistan, it reportedly proved a diplomatic headache. At one point, the FT said, Mr Johnson insisted on visiting the front line in the fight against IS.

California hit by biggest earthquake in 20 yearsA state of emergency has been declared in the city of Ridgecrest as firefighters battle flames.,"This video can not be played Southern California earthquake wrecks homes and businesses Southern California was hit by its strongest earthquake in two decades on Thursday. The epicentre of the 6.4 magnitude tremor was near the city of Ridgecrest, which is about 150 miles (240 km) north-east of Los Angeles. Tremors continued to be felt on Friday, as emergency crews fought fires and provided medical assistance to people. The quake was felt from Las Vegas in Nevada to Los Angeles on California's Pacific coast. It hit at 10:33 local time (18:33GMT) on the US Fourth of July Independence Day holiday. On Friday morning at 04:15, a tremor measuring 5.4 struck. Los Angeles fire officials said there were no immediate reports of additional damage. There was significant damage in Ridgecrest, which lies south-west of the epicentre, local geophysicist Professor John Rundle told the BBC. The epicentre of the earthquake was near the city of Ridgecrest He added that it was fortunate the quake had happened far away from major population centres. Roads were cracked and broken and power lines fell to the ground after the earthquake, which also shattered glass and cracked the walls of some homes in the region. Fire burned some homes in the city of Ridgecrest The Ridgecrest Regional Hospital was evacuated, the Kern County Fire Department said. The service has responded to nearly two dozen incidents ranging from medical assistance for minor injuries to fires. The quake also struck near China Lake - the bomb testing facility of the US Navy, where weapons and aircraft are put to through their paces. One official from the facility told AFP news agency there was ""substantial damage"" â including fires, water leaks, and hazardous materials spills. Brad Alexander, a spokesman for California Governor's Office of Emergency Services, said on Thursday that fire engines and search and rescue teams were going to assist in the Ridgecrest area, where he believed there were a number of buildings on fire. ""This may not be over. There could be more earthquakes happening in the area and anyone listening that's in that region should be prepared to drop, cover and hold on,"" he warned. A man cleans up a supermarket that was damaged by the earthquake Governor of California Gavin Newsom declared an emergency for the areas affected, as concern for potential aftershocks ramped up. In interviews, he called on California residents to have a plan in place in case more earthquakes strike. Mayor of Ridgecrest Peggy Breeden said that some people had been struck by objects falling from buildings and gas lines had been broken. ""We are used to earthquakes but we're not used to this significance,"" she said. Los Angeles' early warning system did not send an advance alert to many residents in the region,the LA Times reports - because the forecast did not meet the threshold of severity for Los Angeles County,external. In the end, the shaking was worse than expected for some people. Stephen Sykes, who lives in Ridgecrest, was in the shower when his house started to shake. ""The whole house shook violently and we both ran out into the street. This went on for about 10 to 15 seconds, we were really scared,"" he told the BBC. ""Currently we are getting ready in case there's another one. We are moving items onto the floor and have turned off the gas supply. We will probably sleep outside tonight,"" he added. President Donald Trump tweeted that the situation was under control. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Reaction to Johnson's foreign secretary appointment,"Mr Johnson raised eyebrows by flattening a Japanese schoolboy in a game of rugby last year Newspapers and politicians around the world have been reacting to Boris Johnson's appointment as UK foreign secretary. Many were surprised, citing his history of faux pas includinginsulting the president of Turkey,externalandcommenting on the US president'sancestry. French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said in a radio interview Mr Johnson was a liar with ""his back against the wall"". One EU source told the BBC: ""Everyone in the European Parliament thinks it's a bad joke and that the Brits have lost it."" Boris Johnson: How Britain's new foreign secretary has insulted the world New UK government: Who's in and who's out? Here we take a look at the response in countries where Mr Johnson will now represent the UK. The Washington Post publishes around-up of ""undiplomatic"" things,externalMr Johnson has said during his time in public life. ""To be sure, Johnson is an unusual candidate for the job. The former journalist is known for his deliberately provocative manner, ruffled appearance and penchant for sometimes-insulting commentary,"" it says. It reminds its readers that just two months ago, ""a poem he concocted about Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan having sexual congress with a goat won the first-place prize in a contest sponsored by Spectator magazine."" Washington Post writer Ishaan Tharoor also writes that Mr Johnson ""has controversially bucked the Western trend and praised Syrian President Bashar al-Assad for battling the Islamic State, no matter its parallel campaign of violence on Syria's civilian population"". ""A Short History of Boris Johnson Insulting Foreign Leaders"" is how the website of American culture and politics magazine, The Atlantic,reports the story,externalof Mr Johnson's comeback. ""The brash and flamboyant politician, the UK's new foreign secretary, is one of the more cosmopolitan figures on the world stage - but he's also one of the least diplomatic,"" it says. This video can not be played Mark Toner, US state department spokesman: ""We look forward to engaging with Boris Johnson"" Apparently stifling a laugh on hearing the news of Mr Johnson's new job, state department spokesman Mark Toner said the US would always work with the UK because of the ""special relationship"" between the two countries. ""This is a relationship that goes beyond personalities and it is an absolutely critical moment in England's history but also in the US-UK relationship,"" he says. In comments to Europe 1 radio, Mr Ayrault said: ""I am not at all worried about Boris Johnson, but... during the [referendum] campaign he lied a lot to the British people and now it is he who has his back against the wall."" Newspaper Le Figaro says Mr Johnson ""gives the impression of being guided by opportunism"". The newspaper says the UK's new foreign secretary's political career has seen him change his mind on gay marriage and on Turkey joining the EU. Pierre Jovawrites in the paper,external: ""Although, he has a 'clown' image which delighted the tabloids with his antics and punchy statements, he was a comrade of David Cameron at Eton and Oxford and is a pure product of the British conservative aristocracy raised to govern."" Ralf Stegner, deputy leader of the SPD party, said: ""[Prime Minister Theresa] May seems to be weaker through making such an appointment."" He said Mr Johnson had hardly demonstrated that he was an outstanding diplomat. ""Now he is negotiating Brexit. Have a nice trip."" Green Party leader Simone Peter said it was ""not a good signal"" if Mr Johnson ""inflicted his capricious and monstrous approach"" on Europe. Der Spiegel took an editorial line against Brexit and published a ""Please don't go"" issue aimed at the UK in the run-up to its EU referendum. The news magazine(in German) calls Mr Johnson a ""controversial politician"",externaland notes that his decision to support a Leave vote was a deciding factor in the referendum campaign, which Leave won with 52% of the vote. One of its columnists, Jakob Augstein, commented: ""Haha! Boris Johnson as foreign minister. I can't stop laughing. The Brits are crazy."" The German journalist Laura Schneider points to a certain amount of mirth on television as presenters announce Mr Johnson's new role. Under the headline: ""Why the disloyal jack of all trades is not the absurd choice"",Die Welt thinks it knows,externalwhy Mrs May appointed him. ""He described Hillary Clinton as a ""sadistic nurse"", compared the EU with Hitler. And now Boris Johnson is the British foreign secretary. But the new prime minister is pursuing a planâ¦ she [Mrs May] incapacitated her anti-EU critics by making them accountable. Now Brexit advocates must ensure that the exit succeeds,"" it says. The deputy editor of Germany's biggest tabloid, Bild, Nikolaus Blome,tweeted,external: ""There's justice after all. As foreign minister, Boris Johnson, now has to lie in the bed he made himself."" The head of the Russian State Duma's foreign affairs committee, Aleksey Pushkov, tweets that Mr Johnson's predecessor, Philip Hammond, has ""painful anti-Russian complexes"" that he hopes Mr Johnson does not share. Mr Hammond said last yearthat Russia had the potential to be ""the single greatest threat"" to UK security and that President Vladimir Putin was ""bent not on joining the international rules-based system which keeps the peace between nations, but on subverting it"". The Russian news website ria.ru calls Mr Johnson ""one of the most eccentric politicians in the UK"" and says he ""knows how to surprise"". A Turkish official suggested Ankara would draw a line under Mr Johnson's previous remarks. ""His negative comments on Erdogan and Turkey are unacceptable... However we're sure of one thing, that British-Turkish relations are more important than that and can't be hostage to these statements,"" he said. This video can not be played Binali Yildirim: 'May God help' Boris Johnson Speaking before Mr Johnson's appointment, Prime Minister Binali Yildirim said the former London mayor had made an ""unfortunate statement"" when he used Turkey's accession to the EU negatively in the referendum. Asked what he would like to say to Mr Johnson, he said: ""May God help him and reform him."" The pro-governmentDaily Sabah,externaldescribed the new foreign secretary (who has Turkish ancestry) as being ""anti-Turkey"" and said he had ""sympathy for the PKK"". Pro-government newspaper commentator Selim Atalaysent a tweet to Johnson saying,external: ""Dear @BorisJohnson I understand you need well-versed apologies in Turkish. I can help you with that. PS: Turkish roots-card won't work. Cheers."" Sydney Morning Herald foreign editor Maher Mughrabiwrites,externalthat Boris Johnson has been ""removed from Conservative Party plotting at Westminster and allowed to get on with being a travelling circus"". The rest of the world, he says, can rely on Mr Johnson to ""confidently lecture people of many nations on their own histories and cultures"". Former prime minister Tony Abbott takes a more benign view: The former prime minister of Sweden, Carl Bildt, tweets that he wishes the appointment were a joke. MEPFredrick Federley tweeted,external: ""Trump, Brexit, Pokemon Go, Boris Johnson. Oh lord, what horrors will you bring us tomorrow?"" Czech MEPPavel Telicka tweeted,external: ""People say PM May does not have a sense of humour. By appointing B Johnson she proved the opposite."" Financial news websitekurzy.cz describes the appointment,externalof Mr Johnson as ""at the very least questionable and very surprising.

"Police cuts 'contribute to feeling of lawlessness'Five former Scotland Yard commissioners say resources are now ""dangerously low"".","British policing resources have been ""drained to dangerously low levels"", five ex-Met Police chiefs have warned. The former commissioners, who ran London's police force from 1993 to 2017, said cuts had ""contributed to the feeling of lawlessness"" generated by knife crime and county lines drugs. They called for a royal commission on policing and the possible ending of the ""fragmented"" system of 45 area forces. The Home Office said it is increasing funds and working on a smarter system. Public safety 'at risk without policing reforms' Are there more police now? Crime solving rates 'woefully low' Ina letter to The Times,externalnewspaper, the former Scotland Yard chiefs - and three other former senior officers - said there had been an ""emasculation of British policing"" in recent years. They said the loss of more than 30,000 officers and support staff in recent years had left the public with ""perilously low expectations"". The cuts, along with the ""virtual destruction"" of neighbourhood policing and the ""undermining"" of powers - such as stop and search, had taken their toll, they said. The retired officers said the next prime minister will ""inherit the urgent task of restoring confidence"". But they did not believe it could be restored by what they describe as a ""fragmented"" system of territorial forces. Labour MP Yvette Cooper, who chairs of the home affairs select committee, said the ""damning"" letter revealed a ""desperate need for more police"". In their letter, the retired officers call for a royal commission - essentially a government-appointed advisory committee - to investigate the state of British policing. Sir Mark Rowley, who signed the letter and was assistant commissioner in Metropolitan Police between 2011-18, said: ""We're saying it needs a fresh look at a national level in terms of how to organise policing to deal with the threats of today."" The letter criticised police and crime commissioners, saying they did not have the skills or resources to address the problems. Sir Mark told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""Having one person overseeing a massive organisation, there's no base in governance for that. You don't have boards of companies which is just one person on their own."" He said such commissioners had ""fairly unchecked powers"" in how they seek to direct the police. Metropolitan Police commissioners Lord Condon (1993-2000) Lord Stevens of Kirkwhelpington (2000-05) Lord Blair of Boughton (2005-08) Sir Paul Stephenson (2009-11) Lord Hogan-Howe (2011-17) Other senior officers Sir Keith Povey, HM chief inspector of constabulary (2002-05) Sir Hugh Orde, president, Association of Chief Police Officers (2009-16) Sir Mark Rowley, assistant commissioner specialist operations, Metropolitan Police (2011-18) The rebuke comes after the chief inspector of constabularywarned public safety could be at riskunless urgent reforms are made. In his annual assessment of policing in England and Wales, Sir Thomas Winsor said there had been a 19% drop in police funding since 2010-11. ""There are indications that some forces are straining under significant pressure as they try to meet growing complex and high-risk demand with weakened resources,"" he said. Ten charts on the rise of knife crime County lines' drug runners 'as young as 11' Sir Thomas called on politicians, police and crime commissioners and chief constables to ""make bold, long-term decisions"". His proposals to improve policing included ""considerable investment in technology to keep up with and get ahead of emerging online offending"". Prime Minister Theresa May was home secretary from 2010 to 2016 and in charge of managing police service budgets. Between September 2009 and September 2017, police forces in England and Wales lost more than 20,000 officers - a drop of 15%. Numbers of officers consistently fell during that period. Last week, the current Met Police Commissioner, Cressida Dick, saidtoo many crimes are being left unsolved. During a speech about the future of policing in England and Wales, she admitted that national detection rates for some offences were ""woefully low"". She added: ""The courts are emptying, not filling. It is not good and I am not proud of it."" This video can not be played Jeremy Hunt: 'The reduction in police numbers went too far' On Thursday, Boris Johnsonpromised to recruit 20,000 more police officersover three years in order to help with ""rounding up the leaders of the county lines drugs gangs"" and help with ""proper stop and search"". Last month, his rival, Jeremy Hunt, said he thought the reduction in police numbers ""went too far"" andcommitted to increasing police numbersif he becomes prime minister. He did not give precise figures, saying ""work needs to be done."" Public safety 'at risk without policing reforms' Crime solving rates 'woefully low' Have police numbers dropped?

Electric cars 'will not solve transport problem',"Car use will still need to be curbed even when all vehicles are powered by clean electricity, a report has said. It warns that electrifying cars will not address traffic jams, urban sprawl and wasted space for parking. The Centre for Research into Energy Demand Solutions (CREDS) report calls on the government to devise a strategy allowing people to have a good standard of living without needing a car. The government said it was spending Â£2bn to promote walking and cycling. It also says it plans to spend Â£50bn on improving roads. However, critics accuse the government of not having a serious plan to deal with the social problems associated with mass car ownership. CREDS is an academic consortium of more than 80 academics across the UK. ""Car use is a massive blind spot on government policy,"" Prof Jillian Anable, one of the authors of the report, said. She added: âFor many years ministers have adopted the principle of trying to meet demand by increasing road space. ""They need to reduce demand instead.â What's your diet's carbon footprint? What is a climate emergency? How can I help? The authors say there will always be people who depend on cars, especially in the countryside or suburbs. But, they point out that many young people in cities are choosing not to buy cars. Instead they are using public transport, walking, cycling, taking minicabs and hiring cars when they are needed. This video can not be played Should I buy an electric car? This more active lifestyle means less obesity, pollution and road danger â and greater sociability as people meet their neighbours on their way to work. It also allows parking spaces to be liberated for more housing or gardens. The government, the authors say, should be encouraging other people to follow the lead set by the young. âIt is a happy accident that car ownership is static in every age group except the over-60s,"" Prof Anable says. ""The government should build on that.â She maintains car ownership is wasteful because cars are parked for 98% of their lifetime, with a third of cars not going out every day. âOnce you own a car,â she says, âthere is a compelling temptation to use it even for simple journeys. âBut it is a really expensive investment. If people do not have cars they can spend the money on other things. âOften once people start to live without a car they wonder why they wanted one in the first place â a car is so much hassle.â She says ministers should prioritise walking, cycling, public transport and vehicle-sharing wherever possible. They should also incentivise local councils to build housing developments that are easy to access without a car. That would also benefit the 25% of households that do not have cars. The report supports government efforts tophase out petrol and diesel cars in the move towards Net Zero emissions. But it says the timetable is too slow, and may not be achieved anyway. Sales of low emission cars fell in the UK for the first time in two years, the industry has said There is a huge challenge in charging vehicles â especially in urban areas with no off-street parking. What is more, drivers tend to be choosing hybrid vehicles rather than pure electric cars â and that will lock in fossil fuel usage into the future. People are also buying status-symbol SUVs which clog up narrow city streets - the report says banning them from some areas might be a solution. The other great technological change under way on the roads is driverless cars. The report warns this dream could also turn sour as car owners may choose to live many miles from their workplace, using their car as a mobile office while sitting in traffic jams they have helped to create. The AAâs president Edmund King agrees electric driverless cars could make congestion worse. He told us: âOne vision of hell is that the driverless car turns up in the city centre where there is no parking. ""The occupant gets out to do their business, whilst the car just continues driving around for hours on end until beckoned back by the user.â He suggests perhaps switching vehicle taxation away from petrol and diesel and on to Road Miles â a charge for the miles you drive, imposed electronically. A spokesperson for the Department for Transport said: ""We are committed to future-proofing our towns and cities for journeys which reduce traffic, encourage healthy exercise, tackle carbon emissions and improve air quality. âThis year, we launched the biggest regulatory review in a generation to ensure we are ready to take advantage of new technologies which can help achieve this. ""We are also helping more people choose cleaner, greener forms of transport by investing around Â£2bn in active travel over the course of this Parliament."" Labour MP Lilian Greenwood called on the government to set targets for 'getting people out of cars' But, Labour's Lilian Greenwood, chair of the Commons Transport Committee, believes ministers must do more. She said: âThe move to electric vehicles is most definitely not a panacea and fails to address wider concerns about public health and the kind of places where we want to live. ""Congestion is a costly blight in many urban areas and there is a real risk that we will end up swapping dirty, polluting traffic jams for clean, green ones.

"Jaguar announces electric car investment in UKThe investment will fund an electric version of the XJ model, helping to secure 2,700 jobs.BusinessComments","This video can not be played JLR's boss calls for more charging points Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) is investing hundreds of millions of pounds to build a range of electric vehicles at its Castle Bromwich plant in Birmingham. Initially the plant will produce an electric version of the Jaguar XJ. JLR says the move will help secure the jobs of 2,700 workers at the plant. The news follows January's announcement, when the firm said it would cut 4,500 jobs, with the majority coming from the UK. That followed 1,500 jobs lost in 2018. JLR has not announced when it will launch the battery version of the XJ, but it will replace the petrol and diesel versions which have been made since 1968. The company's chief executive, Professor Ralph Speth, called on the government to put more effort into providing charging points for electric cars. ""The current charging infrastructure is not really sufficient to cover the country, nor the hotspots of the cities,"" he said in an interview with the BBC. ""The government has to govern the process,"" he added. Electric cars 'will not solve transport problem' 'Grave concern' as sales of low emission cars fall Why most people won't buy an electric car JLR's announcement comes a day after a report showed that in June sales of low emission cars had fallen for the first time in more than two years. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said efforts to sell such cars were being undermined by confusing policies and ""premature"" removal of subsidies. In response, the government said its focus on zero emission models had been a success, with registrations of battery electric vehicles up over 60% this year compared with the same period in 2018. According to another report, even if the nation switches to electric vehicles, car use will still need to be curbed. The Centre for Research into Energy Demand Solutions (CREDS) warned that electrifying cars will not address traffic jams, urban sprawl and wasted space for parking. This video can not be played Should I buy an electric car? The investment decision by JLR appears to contradict previous warnings by the firm that investment in the UK would be threatened by Brexit, and in particular a no-deal scenario. However, industry experts say that JLR could not wait to see the outcome of the Brexit, as it needed to update its range of vehicles. ""Given where it is in its product lifecycle it [JLR] has to make this decision. The capacity is at Castle Bromwich and there's research and development nearby as well, so they've basically run out of time on this decision,"" David Bailey, a professor of business economics at Birmingham Business School, told the BBC's Today programme. Car investment slumps on Brexit 'red alert' Jaguar Land Rover confirms 4,500 job cuts He added that without the new investment the Castle Bromwich plant would ""effectively be dead"". The plant also produces the Jaguar XF, XE and F-Type. Business Secretary Greg Clark said: ""Today's announcement is a vote of confidence in the UK automotive industry - protecting thousands of skilled jobs. ""It reflects our determination for the UK to be at the forefront of the development and manufacturing of the next generation of electric vehicles."" JLR is investing to produce an electric version of the XJ model Investment in the UK car industryfell 47% last year from 2017and the country is attracting a tiny fraction of the global investment in electric cars. VW alone is investing Â£70bn in Europe, the US and China. A no-deal Brexit would see new tariffs imposed on components and parts moving between the EU and the UK. Vauxhall's parent company said that without a deal it would not make the next generation Astra at Ellesmere Port.

"MPs will stop no-deal Brexit, says Hammond","Chancellor Philip Hammond has told the BBC he and other MPs will ""find a way"" of blocking a no-deal Brexit. He told Radio 4's Political Thinking Podcast he would personally oppose leaving the EU without a legal agreement on 31 October. He warned Theresa May's successor as prime minister not to ""sideline"" MPs, saying this would be ""shocking"". Meanwhile, Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson has urged party members to sign a declaration to remain in the EU. Mr Watson is leading the push within the party for another Brexit referendum, and for the party to campaign to stay in the EU. Hunt: Leadership contest is 'all to play for' Tory leadership: Compare the candidates What do Tory party members want? No-deal Brexit: What you need to know Mr Hammond is expected to be replaced as chancellor whoever wins the Conservative leadership election later this month. He has been increasingly vociferous in his opposition to a no-deal Brexit, which both Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt have said they would be willing to pursue on 31 October if there is no prospect of a negotiated deal. On Tuesday, Mr Hammond told MPs a no-deal exit, which would see the UK leave the EU's single market and customs union overnight without any kind of transition arrangement, could cause a Â£90bn hole in the public finances. Speaking onNick Robinson's Political Thinking podcast,he made clear that he would vote against a no-deal exit if it came to it in the Commons. ""The Commons has been clear already that it does not support a no-deal exit. That is my position, and as a backbencher I will continue to argue against a no-deal exit,"" he said. Pressed on how MPs could stop Brexit if the government was unwilling to pass legislation amending the 31 October deadline, he said it would be ""shocking"" if the next prime minister tried to sideline the House of Commons. ""Well, let me quote the Speaker of the House of Commons, who has said that if the House of Commons is determined to do something, he is quite sure that it will find a way.

"MPs will stop no-deal Brexit, says HammondThe chancellor says it would be ""shocking"" if the next prime minister tried to ""sideline"" Parliament.","Chancellor Philip Hammond has told the BBC he and other MPs will ""find a way"" of blocking a no-deal Brexit.

Freeman 'overruled' opening children's hospital,"The Royal Hospital for Sick Children was due to open on Tuesday Health Secretary Jeane Freeman said she overruled NHS Lothian's plans to open the new children's hospital in Edinburgh next week. The Â£150m building in Little France was due to open on Tuesday but is now subject to indefinite delays. The decision not to open the landmark hospital came after last-minute inspections found safety concerns over its ventilation system. It is understood the health board had been considering a partial opening. Ms Freeman has ordered an investigation into the problems with the new building and said patient safety had to come first. Jeane Freeman said she was only notified of the problem on Tuesday She toldBBC radio's Good Morning Scotland: ""NHS Lothian were looking at options, they had not made a decision about what they wanted to do. ""I took the decision that it was not safe to open the hospital next week in any respect until I'd been assured for patient safety that every other area of that hospital met national standards."" Asked if she had overruled the health board, Ms Freeman said: ""Yes, I have."" The new hospital had been due to open in autumn 2017 The health secretary said she was informed on Tuesday that the ""final validation check"" of the ventilation system in Critical Care at the new Royal Hospital for Children and Young People was not meeting national standards. She said: ""Because this was picked up so late I want to be sure that all other safety checks in the rest of the hospital are also conducted again. ""The decision I took was that it was too great a risk."" The corridors of the new hospital will remain empty for some time The new 233-bed hospital will form part of the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh campus, providing care for children and young people to about 16 years of age. It will also have 10 theatres and a children's emergency department. The site, which also includes Clinical Neurosciences and Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services, had been due to open in 2017but a series of problems pushed that back. The building shares the same main contractor and design as the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow, which has also had problems with ventilation systems. Glasgow hospitals infection review team wants to hear from public Ms Freeman was asked in parliament last month if NHS Lothian had been assured the same problems did not exist at the new site. The health secretary said NHS Lothian told her it would not take ownership of the building until it was ""absolutely assured"" those steps had been taken. She said she now needed to find out why the health board was so confident the hospital was meeting standards ""when self-evidently in Critical Care it certainly wasn't"". Ms Freeman said she had asked for an audit of the safety checking process so she could identify where the mistake had been made. The main contractor building the hospital, Multiplex, issued a statement saying its work was signed off as complete by the Independent Certifier on 22 February, when it handed over the building to NHS Lothian. The health secretary said: ""There's no indication at this point that any fault lies with the contractors themselves."" Ms Freeman said she did not know how long it would be before the new hospital was opened but the old Sick Kids hospital would remain in use. She said there was ahelpline available for people who had appointments planned at the new hospital,external. Staff were ready to leave the old Sick Kids hospital Ms Freeman said she should have the results of the additional safety checks ""very soon"". If everything was ok with the rest of the site, there could be a ""phased move"" of other units such as outpatient services and neurosciences. She said work was under way to identify what upgrade was needed to the ventilation system in Critical Care. It was ""likely to take months rather than weeks"" before Critical Care and the Emergency department could open, she said. Ms Freeman admitted that there could be difficulties with any move if it was delayed until the winter months. ""At this point I can't say when Critical Care and the Emergency department will move into the new site,"" she said. Unison Scotland, which represents many NHS staff, said union members were feeling ""exasperated, shocked and concerned"". A dedicated helpline has been set up on 0800 028 2816. This will be operational from 12pm on Friday and will run until 10pm. After that the line will be operational from 8am until 10pm during the week and from 9am to 5pm on Saturdays and Sundays.

Jaguar to announce electric car investment in UK,"This video can not be played JLR's boss calls for more charging points Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) is investing hundreds of millions of pounds to build a range of electric vehicles at its Castle Bromwich plant in Birmingham. Initially the plant will produce an electric version of the Jaguar XJ. JLR says the move will help secure the jobs of 2,700 workers at the plant. The news follows January's announcement, when the firm said it would cut 4,500 jobs, with the majority coming from the UK. That followed 1,500 jobs lost in 2018. JLR has not announced when it will launch the battery version of the XJ, but it will replace the petrol and diesel versions which have been made since 1968. The company's chief executive, Professor Ralph Speth, called on the government to put more effort into providing charging points for electric cars. ""The current charging infrastructure is not really sufficient to cover the country, nor the hotspots of the cities,"" he said in an interview with the BBC. ""The government has to govern the process,"" he added. Electric cars 'will not solve transport problem' 'Grave concern' as sales of low emission cars fall Why most people won't buy an electric car JLR's announcement comes a day after a report showed that in June sales of low emission cars had fallen for the first time in more than two years. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said efforts to sell such cars were being undermined by confusing policies and ""premature"" removal of subsidies. In response, the government said its focus on zero emission models had been a success, with registrations of battery electric vehicles up over 60% this year compared with the same period in 2018. According to another report, even if the nation switches to electric vehicles, car use will still need to be curbed. The Centre for Research into Energy Demand Solutions (CREDS) warned that electrifying cars will not address traffic jams, urban sprawl and wasted space for parking. This video can not be played Should I buy an electric car? The investment decision by JLR appears to contradict previous warnings by the firm that investment in the UK would be threatened by Brexit, and in particular a no-deal scenario. However, industry experts say that JLR could not wait to see the outcome of the Brexit, as it needed to update its range of vehicles. ""Given where it is in its product lifecycle it [JLR] has to make this decision. The capacity is at Castle Bromwich and there's research and development nearby as well, so they've basically run out of time on this decision,"" David Bailey, a professor of business economics at Birmingham Business School, told the BBC's Today programme. Car investment slumps on Brexit 'red alert' Jaguar Land Rover confirms 4,500 job cuts He added that without the new investment the Castle Bromwich plant would ""effectively be dead"". The plant also produces the Jaguar XF, XE and F-Type. Business Secretary Greg Clark said: ""Today's announcement is a vote of confidence in the UK automotive industry - protecting thousands of skilled jobs. ""It reflects our determination for the UK to be at the forefront of the development and manufacturing of the next generation of electric vehicles."" JLR is investing to produce an electric version of the XJ model Investment in the UK car industryfell 47% last year from 2017and the country is attracting a tiny fraction of the global investment in electric cars. VW alone is investing Â£70bn in Europe, the US and China. A no-deal Brexit would see new tariffs imposed on components and parts moving between the EU and the UK. Vauxhall's parent company said that without a deal it would not make the next generation Astra at Ellesmere Port.

"Resources dangerously low, ex-police chiefs warn","British policing resources have been ""drained to dangerously low levels"", five ex-Met Police chiefs have warned. The former commissioners, who ran London's police force from 1993 to 2017, said cuts had ""contributed to the feeling of lawlessness"" generated by knife crime and county lines drugs. They called for a royal commission on policing and the possible ending of the ""fragmented"" system of 45 area forces. The Home Office said it is increasing funds and working on a smarter system. Public safety 'at risk without policing reforms' Are there more police now? Crime solving rates 'woefully low' Ina letter to The Times,externalnewspaper, the former Scotland Yard chiefs - and three other former senior officers - said there had been an ""emasculation of British policing"" in recent years. They said the loss of more than 30,000 officers and support staff in recent years had left the public with ""perilously low expectations"". The cuts, along with the ""virtual destruction"" of neighbourhood policing and the ""undermining"" of powers - such as stop and search, had taken their toll, they said. The retired officers said the next prime minister will ""inherit the urgent task of restoring confidence"". But they did not believe it could be restored by what they describe as a ""fragmented"" system of territorial forces. Labour MP Yvette Cooper, who chairs of the home affairs select committee, said the ""damning"" letter revealed a ""desperate need for more police"". In their letter, the retired officers call for a royal commission - essentially a government-appointed advisory committee - to investigate the state of British policing. Sir Mark Rowley, who signed the letter and was assistant commissioner in Metropolitan Police between 2011-18, said: ""We're saying it needs a fresh look at a national level in terms of how to organise policing to deal with the threats of today."" The letter criticised police and crime commissioners, saying they did not have the skills or resources to address the problems. Sir Mark told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""Having one person overseeing a massive organisation, there's no base in governance for that. You don't have boards of companies which is just one person on their own."" He said such commissioners had ""fairly unchecked powers"" in how they seek to direct the police. Metropolitan Police commissioners Lord Condon (1993-2000) Lord Stevens of Kirkwhelpington (2000-05) Lord Blair of Boughton (2005-08) Sir Paul Stephenson (2009-11) Lord Hogan-Howe (2011-17) Other senior officers Sir Keith Povey, HM chief inspector of constabulary (2002-05) Sir Hugh Orde, president, Association of Chief Police Officers (2009-16) Sir Mark Rowley, assistant commissioner specialist operations, Metropolitan Police (2011-18) The rebuke comes after the chief inspector of constabularywarned public safety could be at riskunless urgent reforms are made. In his annual assessment of policing in England and Wales, Sir Thomas Winsor said there had been a 19% drop in police funding since 2010-11. ""There are indications that some forces are straining under significant pressure as they try to meet growing complex and high-risk demand with weakened resources,"" he said. Ten charts on the rise of knife crime County lines' drug runners 'as young as 11' Sir Thomas called on politicians, police and crime commissioners and chief constables to ""make bold, long-term decisions"". His proposals to improve policing included ""considerable investment in technology to keep up with and get ahead of emerging online offending"". Prime Minister Theresa May was home secretary from 2010 to 2016 and in charge of managing police service budgets. Between September 2009 and September 2017, police forces in England and Wales lost more than 20,000 officers - a drop of 15%. Numbers of officers consistently fell during that period. Last week, the current Met Police Commissioner, Cressida Dick, saidtoo many crimes are being left unsolved. During a speech about the future of policing in England and Wales, she admitted that national detection rates for some offences were ""woefully low"". She added: ""The courts are emptying, not filling. It is not good and I am not proud of it.""

Do Hunt and Johnson's sums add up?Jeremy Hunt: What's his track record?Boris Johnson: What's his track record?,"In the race to succeed Theresa May as leader of the Conservative party and prime minister, Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt are setting out how they want to run the UK. They have both announced taxation and spending plans. So, what are the details and do their sums add up? People would only start to pay the higher rate of income tax when they earn at least Â£80,000, under Boris Johnson's plans The plan:Raise the higher income tax rate from Â£50,000 to Â£80,000. What it means:At the moment,individuals have to pay 40% income tax on any earnings above Â£50,000,external. So, a person earning Â£55,000 a year, pays 40% on Â£5,000. Under Mr Johnson's plan, the point at which the 40% higher rate kicks in would be raised to Â£80,000. This would not affect Scottish workers because the Scottish government sets its own income tax rates and bands. Mr Johnson also wants to raise the point at which people start paying National Insurance, absorbing some of the cost by also raising the ceiling for NI. National Insurance is a separate tax. It's paid for by workers and companies and it is meant to fund state benefits, such as the NHS. Under this new tax regime, someone earning Â£60,000 a year could benefit by Â£1,000 a year, while someone on Â£80,000 or more would gain a maximum of Â£3,000 (because some of the benefits would be lost due to national insurance increases). Is there a Brexit war chest? Hammond calls for honesty on spending pledges Brexit: Where do Conservative leadership candidates stand? But it's wealthy pensioners who stand to benefit the most - up to Â£6,000 each, according to analysis from the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS). That's because pensioners don't pay national insurance to begin with. So if someone already receives a generous work pension, not only will they be subject to less income tax (up to the new threshold), they also won't be affected by the national insurance rise. The cost:Changing the tax system in this way would cost around Â£10bn a year, according to Mr Johnson. He says the bill could be funded from the Â£26.6bn of ""fiscal headroom"". This ""headroom"" refers to government borrowing, which came in lower than originally expected and had been ear-marked by the chancellor for no-deal Brexit planning. However, if Mr Johnson chooses to fund his tax changes with this Â£26.6bn, it would not amount to a permanent solution. That's because the money can only be spent once. So, to pay for the policy in the long term, Mr Johnson will need to raise taxes elsewhere, announce spending cuts or continue to fund it from government borrowing. The plan:Raise public sector pay and increase school funding What it means:A leading supporter of Mr Johnson, Health Secretary Matt Hancock, told the Times that the days of public sector pay freezes under Theresa May and David Cameron would be over if Mr Johnson was elected. Public sector pay was frozen for two years in 2010, except for those earning less than Â£21,000 a year, and rises were capped at 1% in 2013. The government announced an end to the pay cap in 2017, and some public sector workers have negotiated increases above 1% since then. The candidate himself has declined to specify by how much he would increase pay, saying only that remuneration should be ""decent"". He has also pledged to fund increased investment in special needs education, as part of a Â£4.6bn boost to overall school funding. The cost:We don't know by how much Mr Johnson wants to increase public sector pay, butthe IFS says,externalthat each 1% increase in pay for the public sector workforce costs the government about Â£1.8bn a year. The plan:Hire an extra 20,000 police officers by 2022 What it means:There are 122,000 police officers in England and Wales, down from 143,000 in 2010 when Theresa May became home secretary. Mr Johnson plans to reverse almost all of those cuts on the basis that ""more people on our streets means more people are kept safe"". There has been some dispute about the link between police numbers and levels of violent crime, with Theresa May saying there was not a direct link. But Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick has said there is ""some link"" between the two. The cost:Mr Johnson gave a figure of Â£1.1bn. For police officers outside London,the lowest pay,externalwas around Â£25,400 in 2016 (although this differs from force to force). That comes to Â£500m a year, but these costs will increase once they complete training, which takes around two years. Typically, after four years, the pay would increase to Â£33,700 (again outside London) - so almost Â£700m, but this doesn't account for training costs. The Nottinghamshire police force,externalestimated recruitment and training to be around Â£13,000 per officer in 2012 (not including salary received during training). This would come in at about Â£258m for 20,000 new officers, but again, this will differ from force to force. Kit Malthouse, who supports Mr Johnson, says that they would recruit special constables, who are trained as police officers but work part time, to help alleviate training costs. The plan:Cut corporation tax to 12.5% What it means:From April 2020, instead of paying 17% tax on their profits, companies would pay 12.5%. The foreign secretary is in favour of cutting the rate of corporation tax - the tax that companies pay on their profits - to 12.5%, which is the same rate as in the Republic of Ireland. The government is already planning a series of cuts to corporation tax, which was cut from 20% to 19% on 1 April 2017, and is scheduled to fall to 17% next year. The idea of cutting it by another 4.5 percentage pointscame in a report,externalby another Conservative MP at the end of May. The cost:The government estimates the policy would cost about Â£14bn a year. That cost would be reduced if future tax takes were to be boosted by companies being attracted to move to the UK to take advantage of the lower tax rate, or if companies use the money saved to pay higher wages or invest it in improving their productivity. How much that would reduce the cost is very hard to predict. The plan:Take 90% of businesses out of business rates What it means:Business rates are a local tax paid on the use of buildings for non-domestic purposes. The cost:We haven't seen any formal costings of this policy, but in the2018 Budget, Philip Hammonddecided to give a one-third discount on business rates to high street retail businesses with a rateable value below Â£51,000 in 2019-20 and 2020-21. The Treasury said that would benefit 90% of high street retail businesses. The Office for Budget Responsibility said,externalthe discount would cost Â£490m this year and Â£450m next year. It means we can estimate that a 100% cut for those businesses would cost an extra Â£900m next year and about Â£1.35bn a year after that. Business rates are currently collected by local authorities, which retain half of the money. Central government is reimbursing them for the one-third cut and would presumably also reimburse them for the 100% cut. The plan:Increase annual investment allowance to Â£5m What it means:If you are running a business and you buy equipment such as computers or machinery, you can deduct the amount you spend on it from your profits to reduce the amount of tax you have to pay. There is a limit,externalto the amount you can deduct, which is called the annual investment allowance. At the start of this year it was raised from Â£200,000 to Â£1m for two years. The cost:We do not have a costing for this measure either, but to get an idea of the amounts of money involved,the OBR said,externalthe temporary increase to Â£1m would cost Â£600m this year. The plan:Money for fishing, farming and defence What it means:Jeremy Hunt would increase spending on defence from its current level of 2% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP - the sum of everything the UK produces each year) to 2.5% of GDP by 2023-4. He has also said he would have a ""relief programme"" for the fishing and farming sectors to help them deal with the effects of a possible no-deal Brexit. The cost:The boost to defence spending would cost Â£15bn a year by 2023-4. The relief for fishing and farming would cost Â£6bn. Mr Hunt says his overall plans would ""kick-start the economy and create extra growth"", which would mean the government had extra money to spend. But the disruption involved in leaving the EU with no deal is widely expected to reduce growth - at least initially - which would mean that increased taxes or borrowing or reduced spending in other areas would be required to fund the extra spending.

Jeremy Hunt: What's his track record?Boris Johnson: What's his track record?,"Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt will face Boris Johnson in the run-off to become Conservative leader and prime minister. Mr Hunt oversaw the London Olympics as culture secretary and was the UK's longest-serving health secretary. Before entering Parliament, Jeremy Hunt had a career as an English teacher in Japan and as an entrepreneur. He became the MP for South West Surrey at the 2005 general election, taking over from Virginia Bottomley. From 2005 to 2007, Mr Hunt was shadow minister for disabled people. It was a reward for supporting David Cameron, who attended Oxford University at the same time as him, in the Conservative leadership election.  2018-presentForeign secretary 2012-2018Health secretary 2010-2012Culture secretary 2007-2010Shadow culture secretary 2005-2007Shadow minister for disabled people A reshuffle in 2007 saw Mr Hunt promoted to shadow culture secretary. In 2009, he was found to havebreached expenses rules and ordered to repay more than Â£9,500,external. He had allowed his agent to stay rent-free in his constituency property, which was designated as his second home. Mr Hunt had claimed Â£19,117 in public money towards the property, but it was decided he hadn't benefited financially from the situation. When the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government was formed in 2010, Jeremy Hunt joined the cabinet as secretary of state for culture, Olympics, media and sport. Olympics It was a key role in the run-up to London's 2012 Olympics and he worked closely with then London Mayor, Boris Johnson. Mr Hunt campaigned on the importance of tourism during the Olympics. And he took the decision to double the budget for the Olympic and Paralympic ceremonies from Â£40m to Â£81m. The Olympic opening ceremony was widely seen as a big success. This video can not be played Jeremy Hunt's bell-ringing clanger Mr Hunt also put emphasis on creating a lasting legacy for the games. The government gave Sport England Â£1bn to invest in grassroots sports, and Mr Hunt said there was an ""extraordinary chance"" to ""reinvigorate this country's sporting habits for both the young and the old"". But in the years that followed there wasonly a small increase in the number of young people taking up sport. In 2005-06 the proportion of over-16s in England who played sport for at least 30 minutes each week was 34.6%. By 2015-16, it was 36.1%. BSkyB takeover Earlier in 2012, his career was hanging in the balance. During the Leveson Inquiry into the culture and practices of the press, his contact with the Murdoch family came under scrutiny. Mr Hunt was responsible for overseeing the proposed takeover of BSkyB by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. He was criticised for failing to supervise his adviser's contact with News Corp, and for messages he exchanged with James Murdoch on the bid. His special adviser, Adam Smith, was forced to quit. The inquiry released texts sent from Mr Hunt to News Corp lobbyist Fred Michel when it was bidding for BSkyB. The culture secretary addressed him as ""Daddy"" and ""mon ami"" - their wives had given birth in the same hospital in May 2010. Separately, in December 2010, he told Mr Michel there was ""nothing u won't like"" in a forthcoming speech. Mr Hunt insisted he acted with ""total integrity"" during the bid process. Local television As culture secretary, Mr Hunt also led a government plan to launch local television stations across the UK. More than 30 had been set up beforeOfcom later scrapped,externalthe roll-out of any further channels, because of limited interest from viewers and financial difficulties. City TV, the holder of the local TV licence for Birmingham, was forced to appoint administrators to find a buyer before it was even launched, for example. Boris Johnson: What's his track record? Tory leadership candidates compared: Johnson v Hunt Reality Check: What is 'no-deal Brexit'? BBC Mr Hunt also announced a deal with the BBC to freeze the licence fee for six years at Â£145.50 from 2010. He said high executive salaries and an advantage over commercial broadcasters were a cause for concern. That was equivalent to a 16% budget cut in real terms and led to the BBC having to make savings, including 2,000 job losses. Under the agreement, the BBC also took on responsibility for funding the World Service, the Welsh language channel S4C, and the roll-out of broadband to rural areas. Was mayor of London for eight years, overseeing the London 2012 Olympics Resigned as foreign secretary over Theresa May's Brexit strategy Wants to renegotiate the Brexit deal What's Boris Johnson's track record? Jeremy Hunt was appointed health secretary in September 2012, with Maria Miller taking on his previous role. He would eventually become the longest-serving health secretary in NHS history, surpassing its founder, Labour's Aneurin Bevan. NHS funding But Mr Hunt held office during the slowest period of investment in the NHS since its foundation - which created big problems. Since the NHS was established, health spending has risen by about 4% above inflation each year on average. Post-2010, as the coalition budget tried to reduce the deficit, this fell to about 1% a year. This came as demands on the health service were growing. Between 2005 and 2015, A&E visits went up by almost 30%. And during Mr Hunt's tenure as health secretary, the number of people in the population aged 85 and over went up by about a third. The independent Office for Budget Responsibility said funding for the NHS needed to rise by 4.3% a year just to keep up with rising demand, without actively improving standards. Financial difficulties led to more hospitals going into the red, as well as targets being missed in three main areas: cancer care, hospital appointments and A&E waiting times. NHS England has not met any of these targets since 2015. Just 85.3% of patients were seen at A&E departments within the waiting time target of four hours in January 2018. At least 95% of patients attending A&E are supposed to be either admitted, transferred or discharged within four hours. Unions, like the GMB, demanded his resignation. Junior doctors battle As well as a series of austerity measures - which included extending a cap on pay increases for NHS staff - he was also criticised for his handling of the junior doctor contract row. Mr Hunt said that changes to contracts were essential to deliver a seven-day NHS in England by 2020 - a pledge in the Conservatives' 2010 election manifesto. To achieve this, the proposed contracts would mean evenings and Saturdays would be considered ""normal"" rather than ""unsocial"" hours and would no longer attract overtime pay. The NHS's pay review body had said the cost of paying a premium on these ""unsocial hours"" put delivering a seven-day NHS out of reach. Reality Check: How much has social care been cut? Junior doctors responded by tweeting pictures of themselves working weekend and late shifts, with the hashtag #ImInWorkJeremy. Contract negotiations with junior doctors stopped and started and the British Medical Association eventually decided on industrial action. Junior doctors took part in a series of walkouts in 2016. On two strike days, between 08:00 and 17:00 even emergency care wasn't covered - the first time that had ever happened in the history of the NHS. Public support for the strike was high, and even after doctors withdrew emergency care, the majority of the public (57%) still supported the strike and believed the government was more at fault (54%). A newcontract for junior doctors was later imposed, after BMA members rejected a deal agreed by the government and union negotiators. Despite heavy criticism, Mr Hunt did go on to secure a funding increase for the NHS, totalling Â£20.5bn in real terms by 2023. He also oversaw the introduction of an Ofsted-style system for rating hospitals and GP surgeries in England, ranking them on things like cancer, mental health and diabetes services. Patient safety Mr Hunt repeatedly referred in speeches to cases where individuals had received bad treatment in the NHS. He said he was horrified at the report into theStafford Hospital scandal. He went on to overhaul the inspection regime, introduce a new duty of candour on staff and fresh rules about whistle-blowers. Social care Social care was added to his brief in 2018. He spoke of the need to integrate social care, funded by local councils, with services delivered by the NHS. He had already overseen a transfer of money from the NHS to council budgets from 2014. This shared budget was designed to tackle the problem of elderly people having to stay in hospital beds unnecessarily, because of a lack of care for them at home. After this, the number of these cases fell. He also oversaw the introduction of the first national waiting-time target for mental health treatment. From April 2016, the NHS said at least 50% of people experiencing a first episode of psychosis should begin treatment within two weeks of referral. Mr Hunt became foreign secretary in July 2018, after his predecessor and now leadership rival, Boris Johnson, quit over Theresa May's Brexit strategy. In March, he becamethe first Western foreign minister to visit Yemen since conflict there began,external. He has faced criticism for allowing the UK to sell arms to the Saudi regime, which is involved in a controversial military campaign in Yemen. But he has previously defended UK-Saudi ties, saying Saudi Arabia is a ""very, very important military ally to the UK"". His time as foreign secretary has not been gaffe-free. During a meeting on an official visit to China, he called his wife Lucia Guo ""Japanese"" - although she was born in Xian in central China. This video can not be played The foreign secretary tells Today he would include the DUP and ERG in Brexit talks A Remain campaigner in the 2016 EU referendum, Mr Hunt has since said he would vote Leave in a second vote. He said this was because of the ""arrogance of the European Commission"" in Brexit negotiations. He also likened the Brexit negotiating tactics of the EU to the Soviet Union. The comparison provoked criticism from EU ambassadors and politicians and there were calls for an apology. Mr Hunt says he want to negotiate a ""credible"" Brexit plan by securing changes tothe controversial Irish backstop. However, he does not rule out leaving the EU without a deal if such an outcome becomes ""the only way to deliver Brexit"". But unlike his leadership rival, Boris Johnson, he says the current departure date of 31 October is not a hard deadline.

Proroguing Parliament would be shocking - Hammond,"Chancellor Philip Hammond has told the BBC he and other MPs will ""find a way"" of blocking a no-deal Brexit. He told Radio 4's Political Thinking Podcast he would personally oppose leaving the EU without a legal agreement on 31 October. He warned Theresa May's successor as prime minister not to ""sideline"" MPs, saying this would be ""shocking"". Meanwhile, Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson has urged party members to sign a declaration to remain in the EU. Mr Watson is leading the push within the party for another Brexit referendum, and for the party to campaign to stay in the EU. Hunt: Leadership contest is 'all to play for' Tory leadership: Compare the candidates What do Tory party members want? No-deal Brexit: What you need to know Mr Hammond is expected to be replaced as chancellor whoever wins the Conservative leadership election later this month. He has been increasingly vociferous in his opposition to a no-deal Brexit, which both Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt have said they would be willing to pursue on 31 October if there is no prospect of a negotiated deal. On Tuesday, Mr Hammond told MPs a no-deal exit, which would see the UK leave the EU's single market and customs union overnight without any kind of transition arrangement, could cause a Â£90bn hole in the public finances. Speaking onNick Robinson's Political Thinking podcast,he made clear that he would vote against a no-deal exit if it came to it in the Commons. ""The Commons has been clear already that it does not support a no-deal exit. That is my position, and as a backbencher I will continue to argue against a no-deal exit,"" he said. Pressed on how MPs could stop Brexit if the government was unwilling to pass legislation amending the 31 October deadline, he said it would be ""shocking"" if the next prime minister tried to sideline the House of Commons. ""Well, let me quote the Speaker of the House of Commons, who has said that if the House of Commons is determined to do something, he is quite sure that it will find a way. ""And I am quite confident that the House of Commons will find a way, and indeed should be able to find a way. ""Because this is a parliamentary democracy and it would be frankly rather shocking if the House of Commons - the elected representatives of the people - could be simply sidelined by a government that was doing something that was the exact opposite of what the House of Commons clearly wanted done."" His comments were echoed by Justice Secretary David Gauke,who told the House magazine,external, a ""way will be found"" to block a no-deal Brexit. Meanwhile, Cabinet Office Minister - and Mrs May's de facto deputy - David Lidington said he would not want to serve in a government committed to a no-deal Brexit. He told the BBC: ""I am very clear in my mind that I would not want to serve in a government that made a deliberate commitment to a no-deal departure from the European Union. ""I think that would be a profoundly damaging outcome."" Mr Johnson has said he could not ""envisage the circumstances"" in which proroguing - suspending - Parliament would be needed, although he said MPs need to ""take responsibility"" for the situation the country was in. His rival Jeremy Hunt has ruled it out. On the two candidates' spending pledges - and their references to using the Â£26.6bn ""fiscal headroom"" to fund some of those promises - Mr Hammond said there was some additional spending power available. But he said provided there was an ""orderly exit of course, it will be possible to do some of the those spending promises - but not all of them"". ""No deal means we will have to spend the money, but not in a discretionary way,"" he said. ""We will be forced to spend it on protecting businesses and industry and households from what is likely to be a surge in inflation.""

Police resources dangerously low - ex Met chiefs,"British policing resources have been ""drained to dangerously low levels"", five ex-Met Police chiefs have warned. The former commissioners, who ran London's police force from 1993 to 2017, said cuts had ""contributed to the feeling of lawlessness"" generated by knife crime and county lines drugs. They called for a royal commission on policing and the possible ending of the ""fragmented"" system of 45 area forces. The Home Office said it is increasing funds and working on a smarter system. Public safety 'at risk without policing reforms' Are there more police now? Crime solving rates 'woefully low' Ina letter to The Times,externalnewspaper, the former Scotland Yard chiefs - and three other former senior officers - said there had been an ""emasculation of British policing"" in recent years. They said the loss of more than 30,000 officers and support staff in recent years had left the public with ""perilously low expectations"". The cuts, along with the ""virtual destruction"" of neighbourhood policing and the ""undermining"" of powers - such as stop and search, had taken their toll, they said. The retired officers said the next prime minister will ""inherit the urgent task of restoring confidence"". But they did not believe it could be restored by what they describe as a ""fragmented"" system of territorial forces. Labour MP Yvette Cooper, who chairs of the home affairs select committee, said the ""damning"" letter revealed a ""desperate need for more police"". In their letter, the retired officers call for a royal commission - essentially a government-appointed advisory committee - to investigate the state of British policing. Sir Mark Rowley, who signed the letter and was assistant commissioner in Metropolitan Police between 2011-18, said: ""We're saying it needs a fresh look at a national level in terms of how to organise policing to deal with the threats of today."" The letter criticised police and crime commissioners, saying they did not have the skills or resources to address the problems. Sir Mark told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""Having one person overseeing a massive organisation, there's no base in governance for that. You don't have boards of companies which is just one person on their own."" He said such commissioners had ""fairly unchecked powers"" in how they seek to direct the police. Metropolitan Police commissioners Lord Condon (1993-2000) Lord Stevens of Kirkwhelpington (2000-05) Lord Blair of Boughton (2005-08) Sir Paul Stephenson (2009-11) Lord Hogan-Howe (2011-17) Other senior officers Sir Keith Povey, HM chief inspector of constabulary (2002-05) Sir Hugh Orde, president, Association of Chief Police Officers (2009-16) Sir Mark Rowley, assistant commissioner specialist operations, Metropolitan Police (2011-18) The rebuke comes after the chief inspector of constabularywarned public safety could be at riskunless urgent reforms are made. In his annual assessment of policing in England and Wales, Sir Thomas Winsor said there had been a 19% drop in police funding since 2010-11. ""There are indications that some forces are straining under significant pressure as they try to meet growing complex and high-risk demand with weakened resources,"" he said. Ten charts on the rise of knife crime County lines' drug runners 'as young as 11' Sir Thomas called on politicians, police and crime commissioners and chief constables to ""make bold, long-term decisions"". His proposals to improve policing included ""considerable investment in technology to keep up with and get ahead of emerging online offending"". Prime Minister Theresa May was home secretary from 2010 to 2016 and in charge of managing police service budgets. Between September 2009 and September 2017, police forces in England and Wales lost more than 20,000 officers - a drop of 15%. Numbers of officers consistently fell during that period.

"China separating Muslim children from familiesThousands of ethnic minority Muslim children undergo ""cultural re-engineering"" in giant boarding schools.","This video can not be played The BBC's John Sudworth meets Uighur parents in Turkey who say their children are missing in China China is deliberately separating Muslim children from their families, faith and language in its far western region of Xinjiang, according to new research. At the same time as hundreds of thousands of adults are being detained in giant camps, a rapid, large-scale campaign to build boarding schools is under way. Based on publicly available documents, and backed up by dozens of interviews with family members overseas, the BBC has gathered some of the most comprehensive evidence to date about what is happening to children in the region. Records show that in one township alone more than 400 children have lost not just one but both parents to some form of internment, either in the camps or in prison. Formal assessments are carried out to determine whether the children are in need of ""centralised care"". Alongside the efforts to transform the identity of Xinjiang's adults, the evidence points to a parallel campaign to systematically remove children from their roots. The Hotan Kindness Kindergarten, like many others, is a high security facility China's tight surveillance and control in Xinjiang, where foreign journalists are followed 24 hours a day, make it impossible to gather testimony there. But it can be found in Turkey. In a large hall in Istanbul, dozens of people queue to tell their stories, many of them clutching photographs of children, all now missing back home in Xinjiang. ""I don't know who is looking after them,"" one mother says, pointing to a picture of her three young daughters, ""there is no contact at all."" Another mother, holding a photo of three sons and a daughter, wipes away her tears. ""I heard that they've been taken to an orphanage,"" she says. In 60 separate interviews, in wave after wave of anxious, grief-ridden testimony, parents and other relatives give details of the disappearance in Xinjiang of more than 100 children. They are all Uighurs - members of Xinjiang's largest, predominantly Muslim ethnic group that has long had ties of language and faith to Turkey. Thousands have come to study or to do business, to visit family, or to escape China's birth control limits and the increasing religious repression. But over the past three years, they have found themselves trapped after China began detaining hundreds of thousands of Uighurs and other minorities in giant camps. China's hidden camps: The vanished Uighurs of Xinjiang 'I spent seven days of hell in Chinese camps' China's Muslim 'crackdown' explained The Chinese authorities say the Uighurs are being educated in ""vocational training centres"" in order to combat violent religious extremism. But evidence shows that many are being detained for simply expressing their faith - praying or wearing a veil - or for having overseas connections to places like Turkey. For these Uighurs, going back means almost certain detention. Phone contact has been severed - even speaking to relatives overseas is now too dangerous for those in Xinjiang. With his wife detained back home, one father tells me he fears some of his eight children may now be in the care of the Chinese state. ""I think they've been taken to child education camps,"" he says. New research commissioned by the BBC sheds light on what is really happening to these children and many thousands of others. Dr Adrian Zenz is a German researcher widely credited with exposing the full extent of China's mass detentions of adult Muslims in Xinjiang. Based on publicly available official documents, hisreport paints a picture of an unprecedented school expansion drive,externalin Xinjiang. Campuses have been enlarged, new dormitories built and capacity increased on a massive scale. Significantly, the state has been growing its ability to care full-time for large numbers of children at precisely the same time as it has been building the detention camps. And it appears to be targeted at precisely the same ethnic groups. In just one year, 2017, the total number of children enrolled in kindergartens in Xinjiang increased by more than half a million. And Uighur and other Muslim minority children, government figures show, made up more than 90% of that increase. As a result, Xinjiang's pre-school enrolment level has gone from below the national average to the highest in China by far. In the south of Xinjiang alone, an area with the highest concentration of Uighur populations, the authorities have spent an eye watering $1.2bn on the building and upgrading of kindergartens. Mr Zenz's analysis suggests that this construction boom has included the addition of large amounts of dormitory space. Xinhe County Youyi Kindergarten has space for 700 children, 80% of whom are from Xinjiang's minority groups Xinjiang's education expansion is driven, it appears, by the same ethos as underlies the mass incarceration of adults. And it is clearly affecting almost all Uighur and other minority children, whether their parents are in the camps or not. In 2018 work began on a site for two new boarding schools in Xinjiang's southern city of Yecheng (known as Kargilik in Uighur). Yecheng County Middle Schools 10 and 11 Dragging the slider reveals the pace of construction - the two middle schools, separated by a shared sports field, are each three times larger than the national average and were built in little more than a year. In April last year, the county authorities relocated 2,000 children from the surrounding villages into yet another giant boarding middle school, Yecheng County Number 4. Government propaganda extols the virtues of boarding schools as helping to ""maintain social stability and peace"" with the ""school taking the place of the parents."" And Mr Zenz suggests there is a deeper purpose. ""Boarding schools provide the ideal context for a sustained cultural re-engineering of minority societies,"" he argues. Just as with the camps, his research shows that there is now a concerted drive to all but eliminate the use of Uighur and other local languages from school premises. Individual school regulations outline strict, points-based punishments for both students and teachers if they speak anything other than Chinese while in school. And this aligns with other official statements claiming that Xinjiang has already achieved full Chinese language teaching in all of its schools. This video can not be played The BBC visits the camps where Chinaâs Muslims have their ""thoughts transformed"" Speaking to the BBC, Xu Guixiang, a senior official with Xinjiang's Propaganda Department, denies that the state is having to care for large numbers of children left parentless as a result. ""If all family members have been sent to vocational training then that family must have a severe problem,"" he says, laughing. ""I've never seen such a case."" But perhaps the most significant part of Mr Zenz's work is his evidence that shows that the children of detainees are indeed being channelled into the boarding school system in large numbers. Searching for truth in China's 're-education' camps Why is there tension between China and the Uighurs? China's Muslim camp spending 'revealed' There are the detailed forms used by local authorities to log the situations of children with parents in vocational training or in prison, and to determine whether they need centralised care. Mr Zenz found one government document that details various subsidies available to ""needy groups"", including those families where ""both a husband and a wife are in vocational training"". And a directive issued to education bureaus by the city of Kashgar that mandates them to look after the needs of students with parents in the camps as a matter of urgency. Schools should ""strengthen psychological counselling"", the directive says, and ""strengthen students' thought education"" - a phrase that finds echoes in the camps holding their parents. It is clear that the effect of the mass internments on children is now viewed as a significant societal issue, and that some effort is going into dealing with it, although it is not something the authorities are keen to publicise. This video can not be played The BBC has found new evidence of the increasing control and suppression of Islam in China Some of the relevant government documents appear to have been deliberately hidden from search engines by using obscure symbols in place of the term ""vocational training"". That said, in some instances the adult detention camps have kindergartens built close by, and, when visiting, Chinese state media reporters have extolled their virtues. These boarding schools, they say, allow minority children to learn ""better life habits"" and better personal hygiene than they would at home. Some children have begun referring to their teachers as ""mummy"". We telephoned a number of local Education Bureaus in Xinjiang to try to find out about the official policy in such cases. Most refused to speak to us, but some gave brief insights into the system. We asked one official what happens to the children of those parents who have been taken to the camps. ""They're in boarding schools,"" she replied. ""We provide accommodation, food and clothesâ¦ and we've been told by the senior level that we must look after them well."" Hotan Sunshine Kindergarten, seen through a wire fence In the hall in Istanbul, as the stories of broken families come tumbling out, there is raw despair and deep resentment too. ""Thousands of innocent children are being separated from their parents and we are giving our testimonies constantly,"" one mother tells me. ""Why does the world keep silent when knowing these facts?"" Back in Xinjiang, the research shows that all children now find themselves in schools that are secured with ""hard isolation closed management measures."" Many of the schools bristle with full-coverage surveillance systems, perimeter alarms and 10,000 Volt electric fences, with some school security spending surpassing that of the camps. The policy was issued in early 2017, at a time when the detentions began to be dramatically stepped up. Was the state, Mr Zenz wonders, seeking to pre-empt any possibility on the part of Uighur parents to forcibly recover their children? ""I think the evidence for systematically keeping parents and children apart is a clear indication that Xinjiang's government is attempting to raise a new generation cut off from original roots, religious beliefs and their own language,"" he tells me. ""I believe the evidence points to what we must call cultural genocide."" Searching for truth in China's 're-education' camps China's vanishing beards and mosques.

Trees 'most effective solution' for climate changeA controversial study suggests extreme climate change can be averted by planting a billion hectares of trees.,"Researchers say an area the size of the US is available for planting trees around the world, and this could have a dramatic impact on climate change. Thestudy shows,externalthat the space available for trees is far greater than previously thought, and would reduce CO2 in the atmosphere by 25%. The authors say that this is the most effective climate change solution available to the world right now. But other researchers say the new study is ""too good to be true"". 'Football pitch' of Amazon forest lost every minute Tropical tree loss persists at high levels Climate change made heat five times more likely The ability of trees to soak up carbon dioxide has long made them a valuable weapon in the fight against rising temperatures. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) said that if the world wanted to limit the rise to 1.5C by 2050, an extra 1bn hectares (2.4bn acres) of trees would be needed. The problem has been that accurate estimates of just how many trees the world can support have been hard to come by. This new report aims to show not just how many trees can be grown, but where they could be planted and how much of an impact they would have on carbon emissions. A map showing only the potential for restoring forests and excluding desert, agricultural and urban areas The scientists from ETH-Zurich in Switzerland used a method called photo-interpretation to examine a global dataset of observations covering 78,000 forests. Using the mapping software of the Google Earth engine they were able to develop a predictive model to map the global potential for tree cover. They found that excluding existing trees, farmland and urban areas, the world could support an extra 0.9bn hectares (2.22bn acres) of tree cover. Once these trees matured they could pull down around 200 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide, some two-thirds of extra carbon from human activities put into the atmosphere since the industrial revolution. This is a quarter of the overall amount of CO2 in the air. ""Our study shows clearly that forest restoration is the best climate change solution available today and it provides hard evidence to justify investment,"" said Prof Tom Crowther, the senior author on the study. ""If we act now, this could cut carbon dioxide in the atmosphere by up to 25%, to levels last seen almost a century ago."" The researchers identify six countries where the bulk of the forest restoration could occur: Russia (151m hectares), US (103m), Canada (78m), Australia (58m), Brazil (50m) and China (40m). But they say speed is of the essence because as the world continues to warm then the potential area for planting trees in the tropics would be reduced. ""It will take decades for new forests to mature and achieve this potential,"" said Prof Crowther. ""It is vitally important that we protect the forests that exist today, pursue other climate solutions, and continue to phase out fossil fuels from our economies."" The new study has been welcomed by Christiana Figueres, former UN climate chief, who was instrumental in delivering the Paris climate agreement in 2015. ""Finally an authoritative assessment of how much land we can and should cover with trees without impinging on food production or living areas,"" she said in a statement. ""A hugely important blueprint for governments and private sector."" However not everyone was as effusive about the new study. Several researchers expressed reservations, taking issue with the idea that planting trees was the best climate solution available to the world right now. ""Restoration of trees may be 'among the most effective strategies', but it is very far indeed from 'the best climate change solution available,' and a long way behind reducing fossil fuel emissions to net zero,"" said Prof Myles Allen from the University of Oxford. Planting trees is important say some scientists but cutting emissions is paramount Others are critical of the estimates of carbon that could be stored if these trees were planted. ""The estimate that 900 million hectares restoration can store an addition 205 billion tonnes of carbon is too high and not supported by either previous studies or climate models,"" said Prof Simon Lewis from University College London. ""Planting trees to soak up two-thirds of the entire anthropogenic carbon burden to date sounds too good to be true.  Probably because it is,"" said Prof Martin Lukac from the University of Reading. ""This far, humans have enhanced forest cover on a large scale only by shrinking their population size (Russia), increasing productivity of industrial agriculture (the West) or by direct order of an autocratic government (China).  None of these activities look remotely feasible or sustainable at global scale."" The study has been published in the journal Science.

"Electric cars 'will not solve transport problem'Car use will still need to be curbed, even when all vehicles use clean electricity, a report warns.UK","Car use will still need to be curbed even when all vehicles are powered by clean electricity, a report has said. It warns that electrifying cars will not address traffic jams, urban sprawl and wasted space for parking. The Centre for Research into Energy Demand Solutions (CREDS) report calls on the government to devise a strategy allowing people to have a good standard of living without needing a car. The government said it was spending Â£2bn to promote walking and cycling. It also says it plans to spend Â£50bn on improving roads. However, critics accuse the government of not having a serious plan to deal with the social problems associated with mass car ownership. CREDS is an academic consortium of more than 80 academics across the UK. ""Car use is a massive blind spot on government policy,"" Prof Jillian Anable, one of the authors of the report, said. She added: âFor many years ministers have adopted the principle of trying to meet demand by increasing road space. ""They need to reduce demand instead.â What's your diet's carbon footprint? What is a climate emergency? How can I help? The authors say there will always be people who depend on cars, especially in the countryside or suburbs. But, they point out that many young people in cities are choosing not to buy cars. Instead they are using public transport, walking, cycling, taking minicabs and hiring cars when they are needed. This video can not be played Should I buy an electric car? This more active lifestyle means less obesity, pollution and road danger â and greater sociability as people meet their neighbours on their way to work. It also allows parking spaces to be liberated for more housing or gardens. The government, the authors say, should be encouraging other people to follow the lead set by the young. âIt is a happy accident that car ownership is static in every age group except the over-60s,"" Prof Anable says. ""The government should build on that.â She maintains car ownership is wasteful because cars are parked for 98% of their lifetime, with a third of cars not going out every day. âOnce you own a car,â she says, âthere is a compelling temptation to use it even for simple journeys. âBut it is a really expensive investment. If people do not have cars they can spend the money on other things. âOften once people start to live without a car they wonder why they wanted one in the first place â a car is so much hassle.â She says ministers should prioritise walking, cycling, public transport and vehicle-sharing wherever possible. They should also incentivise local councils to build housing developments that are easy to access without a car. That would also benefit the 25% of households that do not have cars. The report supports government efforts tophase out petrol and diesel cars in the move towards Net Zero emissions. But it says the timetable is too slow, and may not be achieved anyway. Sales of low emission cars fell in the UK for the first time in two years, the industry has said There is a huge challenge in charging vehicles â especially in urban areas with no off-street parking. What is more, drivers tend to be choosing hybrid vehicles rather than pure electric cars â and that will lock in fossil fuel usage into the future. People are also buying status-symbol SUVs which clog up narrow city streets - the report says banning them from some areas might be a solution. The other great technological change under way on the roads is driverless cars. The report warns this dream could also turn sour as car owners may choose to live many miles from their workplace, using their car as a mobile office while sitting in traffic jams they have helped to create. The AAâs president Edmund King agrees electric driverless cars could make congestion worse. He told us: âOne vision of hell is that the driverless car turns up in the city centre where there is no parking. ""The occupant gets out to do their business, whilst the car just continues driving around for hours on end until beckoned back by the user.â He suggests perhaps switching vehicle taxation away from petrol and diesel and on to Road Miles â a charge for the miles you drive, imposed electronically. A spokesperson for the Department for Transport said: ""We are committed to future-proofing our towns and cities for journeys which reduce traffic, encourage healthy exercise, tackle carbon emissions and improve air quality. âThis year, we launched the biggest regulatory review in a generation to ensure we are ready to take advantage of new technologies which can help achieve this. ""We are also helping more people choose cleaner, greener forms of transport by investing around Â£2bn in active travel over the course of this Parliament."" Labour MP Lilian Greenwood called on the government to set targets for 'getting people out of cars' But, Labour's Lilian Greenwood, chair of the Commons Transport Committee, believes ministers must do more. She said: âThe move to electric vehicles is most definitely not a panacea and fails to address wider concerns about public health and the kind of places where we want to live. ""Congestion is a costly blight in many urban areas and there is a real risk that we will end up swapping dirty, polluting traffic jams for clean, green ones. ""Inactivity and obesity are increasingly serious public health problems. Getting people out of their cars is essential, yet the government has no targets for such a shift - my committee has called for that to change.""

Policing resources dangerously low - ex Met chiefs,"British policing resources have been ""drained to dangerously low levels"", five ex-Met Police chiefs have warned. The former commissioners, who ran London's police force from 1993 to 2017, said cuts had ""contributed to the feeling of lawlessness"" generated by knife crime and county lines drugs. They called for a royal commission on policing and the possible ending of the ""fragmented"" system of 45 area forces. The Home Office said it is increasing funds and working on a smarter system. Public safety 'at risk without policing reforms' Are there more police now? Crime solving rates 'woefully low' Ina letter to The Times,externalnewspaper, the former Scotland Yard chiefs - and three other former senior officers - said there had been an ""emasculation of British policing"" in recent years. They said the loss of more than 30,000 officers and support staff in recent years had left the public with ""perilously low expectations"". The cuts, along with the ""virtual destruction"" of neighbourhood policing and the ""undermining"" of powers - such as stop and search, had taken their toll, they said. The retired officers said the next prime minister will ""inherit the urgent task of restoring confidence"". But they did not believe it could be restored by what they describe as a ""fragmented"" system of territorial forces. Labour MP Yvette Cooper, who chairs of the home affairs select committee, said the ""damning"" letter revealed a ""desperate need for more police"". In their letter, the retired officers call for a royal commission - essentially a government-appointed advisory committee - to investigate the state of British policing. Sir Mark Rowley, who signed the letter and was assistant commissioner in Metropolitan Police between 2011-18, said: ""We're saying it needs a fresh look at a national level in terms of how to organise policing to deal with the threats of today."" The letter criticised police and crime commissioners, saying they did not have the skills or resources to address the problems. Sir Mark told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""Having one person overseeing a massive organisation, there's no base in governance for that. You don't have boards of companies which is just one person on their own."" He said such commissioners had ""fairly unchecked powers"" in how they seek to direct the police. Metropolitan Police commissioners Lord Condon (1993-2000) Lord Stevens of Kirkwhelpington (2000-05) Lord Blair of Boughton (2005-08) Sir Paul Stephenson (2009-11) Lord Hogan-Howe (2011-17) Other senior officers Sir Keith Povey, HM chief inspector of constabulary (2002-05) Sir Hugh Orde, president, Association of Chief Police Officers (2009-16) Sir Mark Rowley, assistant commissioner specialist operations, Metropolitan Police (2011-18) The rebuke comes after the chief inspector of constabularywarned public safety could be at riskunless urgent reforms are made. In his annual assessment of policing in England and Wales, Sir Thomas Winsor said there had been a 19% drop in police funding since 2010-11. ""There are indications that some forces are straining under significant pressure as they try to meet growing complex and high-risk demand with weakened resources,"" he said. Ten charts on the rise of knife crime County lines' drug runners 'as young as 11' Sir Thomas called on politicians, police and crime commissioners and chief constables to ""make bold, long-term decisions"". His proposals to improve policing included ""considerable investment in technology to keep up with and get ahead of emerging online offending"". Prime Minister Theresa May was home secretary from 2010 to 2016 and in charge of managing police service budgets. Between September 2009 and September 2017, police forces in England and Wales lost more than 20,000 officers - a drop of 15%. Numbers of officers consistently fell during that period. Last week, the current Met Police Commissioner, Cressida Dick, saidtoo many crimes are being left unsolved.

Labour MP Yvette Cooper, who chairs of the home affairs select committee, said the ""damning"" letter revealed a ""desperate need for more police"". In their letter, the retired officers call for a royal commission - essentially a government-appointed advisory committee - to investigate the state of British policing. Sir Mark Rowley, who signed the letter and was assistant commissioner in Metropolitan Police between 2011-18, said: ""We're saying it needs a fresh look at a national level in terms of how to organise policing to deal with the threats of today."" The letter criticised police and crime commissioners, saying they did not have the skills or resources to address the problems. Sir Mark told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""Having one person overseeing a massive organisation, there's no base in governance for that. You don't have boards of companies which is just one person on their own."" He said such commissioners had ""fairly unchecked powers"" in how they seek to direct the police. Metropolitan Police commissioners Lord Condon (1993-2000) Lord Stevens of Kirkwhelpington (2000-05) Lord Blair of Boughton (2005-08) Sir Paul Stephenson (2009-11) Lord Hogan-Howe (2011-17) Other senior officers Sir Keith Povey, HM chief inspector of constabulary (2002-05) Sir Hugh Orde, president, Association of Chief Police Officers (2009-16) Sir Mark Rowley, assistant commissioner specialist operations, Metropolitan Police (2011-18) The rebuke comes after the chief inspector of constabularywarned public safety could be at riskunless urgent reforms are made. In his annual assessment of policing in England and Wales, Sir Thomas Winsor said there had been a 19% drop in police funding since 2010-11. ""There are indications that some forces are straining under significant pressure as they try to meet growing complex and high-risk demand with weakened resources,"" he said.

His proposals to improve policing included ""considerable investment in technology to keep up with and get ahead of emerging online offending"". Prime Minister Theresa May was home secretary from 2010 to 2016 and in charge of managing police service budgets. Between September 2009 and September 2017, police forces in England and Wales lost more than 20,000 officers - a drop of 15%. Numbers of officers consistently fell during that period. Last week, the current Met Police Commissioner, Cressida Dick, saidtoo many crimes are being left unsolved. During a speech about the future of policing in England and Wales, she admitted that national detection rates for some offences were ""woefully low"". She added: ""The courts are emptying, not filling. It is not good and I am not proud of it.""

Last month, his rival, Jeremy Hunt, said he thought the reduction in police numbers ""went too far"" andcommitted to increasing police numbersif he becomes prime minister. He did not give precise figures, saying ""work needs to be done."" Public safety 'at risk without policing reforms' Crime solving rates 'woefully low' Have police numbers dropped?
