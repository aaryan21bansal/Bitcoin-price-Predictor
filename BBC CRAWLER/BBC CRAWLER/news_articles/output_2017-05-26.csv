Reality Check: Why does the Prevent strategy divide opinion?,"In the aftermath of the Manchester Arena bomb attack, the government's approach to tackling radicalisation has once again come under scrutiny. Reality Check has been looking at the government's Prevent programme - asking how it works and why it divides opinion. Prevent is one of four strands of the government's counter-terrorism strategy, known as Contest. It was created by the Labour government in 2003 and its remit was widened by the coalition government in 2011. The other strands are: Prepare; Protect; and Pursue. Prevent is designed to support people at risk of joining extremist groups and carrying out terrorist activities. In practice it means police and other organisations trying to build relations across the UK and putting programmes in places such as schools, faith organisations, prisons and other communities where people can be at risk of radicalisation. It requires faith leaders, teachers, doctors and others to refer any suspicions to a local Prevent body. An assessment is then made about whether further action is needed. Social services departments have become increasingly involved in identifying Prevent cases because of their duty to counter radicalisation. About 7,500 referrals were made to the scheme in 2015-16 - the equivalent of 20 a day - according to a Freedom of Information Request to the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC). Out of those referrals, action was taken in one in every 10 cases. No action at all was taken in 37% of the cases, while a quarter of people referred were found to be vulnerable but not at risk of terrorist involvement. The remaining 28% were still being considered. In cases where an ideology was recorded, just over half related to Islamist extremism and nearly one in 10 were linked to far-right extremism. In some areas of the country, including parts of north-west England, the number of far-right referrals far outstrips the number of Islamist cases. Where action is taken, an individual can be placed on the government's Channel Programme. This is a support plan which may include mentoring. The annual Prevent budget is not officially published - but it is thought to be around Â£40m a year. We do know that after therevised strategy was published,externalin 2011, the government set aside Â£46m of spending (Â£36m from the Home Office and Â£10m from the Foreign Office). David Anderson - the former independent reviewer of terror legislation - has said Prevent receives 1% of the overall Â£3bn counter-terrorism budget. While the Prevent strategy has divided opinion, the government says it is working. Itsays 150 people, including 50 children, were stopped from entering conflict zones in Iraq and Syria in 2015 because of the strategy.,external The government also says that its counter-radicalisation programmes reached more than 42,000 people in 2015/16. The strategy is also backed by senior police figures. The Leicestershire Chief Constable Simon Colehas called it ""absolutely fundamental"" in tackling terrorism in the UK. He said the scheme was about ""putting an arm around"" people at risk of radicalisation: ""We try and divert, allow people the opportunity to help them make better decisions. It's absolutely fundamental. It has enabled us to try and help stabilise communities and stop people getting us into a cycle of aggravation."" The Prevent strategy has been criticised by some MPs, the National Union of Teachers and the Muslim Council of Britain. Some argue the strategy is counterproductive and that it can make Islamic students, for example, feel isolated and possibly more open to radicalisation. Another worry is that it can add to a general sense of distrust across communities. A former senior Muslim police officer, Dal Babu, said in 2015 that Prevent had become ""tainted"" and ""toxic"". He argued that Muslim community organisations ""have this Prevent [label] stamped on them and are then vilified"". The Muslim Council of Britain says Prevent is too intrusive and references are over-zealous. It gives an example of two college students stopped by a lecturer who noticed that they had made way for two female students and lowered their gaze. The Council says they were reported to the senior team for ""concerning behaviour"". Another problem is that it is very difficult to measure the full extent of the strategy's successes and failures. It is impossible to know how many people may or may not have gone on to commit terrorist acts without coming into contact with Prevent. TheConservative manifesto,externaldoes not make specific mention to Prevent. It does, however, say: ""We will continue to invest in our world-leading security services and maintain and develop our counter-terrorism strategy to protect us from terrorism at home and abroad."" Speaking toBBC Radio 4's Today programmein the aftermath of the Manchester attack, Home Secretary Amber Rudd said that if the Conservatives were re-elected, the strategy would receive more money. Labour's manifesto,externalpledges to review the Prevent programme with a view to assessing both its effectiveness and its potential to alienate minority communities. It says: ""In doing so, we will address the government's failure to take any effective new measures against a growing problem of extreme or violent radicalisation."" The Liberal Democrats say they will scrap Prevent altogether.Its manifesto,externalsays it will ""replace it with a scheme that prioritises community engagement and supports communities in developing their own approach to tackling the dangers of violent extremism"". The SNP is yet to publish its manifesto. However the party has previouslycalled for a review into Prevent,,externalsaying the strategy leads to ""confusion and alienation and risks being significantly counter-productive"". UKIP's manifesto,externaldoes not explicitly mention Prevent. The party did pledge, however, to segregate extremists from the wider prison population to prevent a spread of radicalisation.

Footage of the real life Biggles now online,"This video can not be played The first flight over Mount Everest captured by Major Stewart Blacker in 1933 The Royal Geographical Society is releasing thefilms of the scientific explorations it sponsored,externalin the early 20th Century. The priceless footage, some of which has not been seen for nearly 100 years, is being digitised and put online. The films are also helping scientists today learn more about the impact of climate change. BBC News has had exclusive access to the films. Among them is the first aerial footage of the top of Mount Everest. It was shot in 1933 by Major Latham Valentine Stewart Blacker, a former fighter pilot and war hero. He was a real life Biggles! Blacker and his friends risked their lives flying in specially built biplanes, higher than anyone had flown before, to capture historic footage. Alasdair MacLeod, who is in charge of the project for the RGS, says that the film is one of more than a hundred in the RGS's possession that will be put online this year. ""The society has a collection of over two million items. It's the world's largest collection of geographically related maps, photographs, artefacts, diaries, notebooks and publications. And this film collection, which has been housed at the British Film Institute's national archive for many years, has not been made more accessible."" This video can not be played Dancers in Tibet in 1922 wearing an apron made from human bones But it has now. The most shocking is the earliest known footage of Tibet shot in 1922. It was taken by an army officer, Captain John Noel, on the first ever attempt to reach the top of Mount Everest. He filmed a scene at a monastery on the way to Everest where the climbers seek a blessing from the monks. They are treated as honoured guests and shown ritual dances, telling stories of reincarnation. Around the dancers' waists are aprons made from a lattice of human bones; their face masks are made from stretched human skin. Captain Noel's daughter Sandra told me that the attempt to climb Everest was like the Moon landings at that time. ""This was going to be a world event and it captured the imagination. People had just emerged from the war. They were impoverished and had very little to be excited about. And here was this expedition to Mount Everest."" Captain Noel's footage is of scientific as well as historical value. It will be used by researchers to compare with current images to help them assess the impact climate change has had on the Himalayas over the past 100 years. This video can not be played Ralph Bagnold and his friends drove thousands of miles into the Libyan Desert In 1932, cinema audiences were amazed to see the exploits of another young army officer, Ralph Bagnold, journeying thousands of miles across the Libyan Desert in a car. When one of the cars broke down it was cannibalised for spare parts and abandoned. And they are still out there somewhere buried among the dunes. The vehicles would often get stuck in the sand - and each time Bagnold and his team would find ever more ingenious ways of extricating them. It seems like an odd thing to do now, but Bagnold and his friends risked their lives on this expedition because they saw it as a great challenge - so says the adventurer's son, Stephen. ""The experts proclaimed it couldn't be done. To dad that was the greatest possible spur, not that he wanted to show that he was the master or anything like that, but just because it tickled his fancy and that maybe with clear planning and with the right equipment there could be a way of crossing the desert,"" Stephen told BBC News. Bagnold took careful measurements during his expedition to understand how the sand is moved by the wind. He published several research papers on the subject. His work would later help the American and European space agencies explore Mars. His insights are being used to design rovers that can cross Martian sand without getting stuck. This video can not be played Skyscrapers were built from mud in 16th Century Yemen Thousands of miles away in Yemen a pilot, Aubery Rickards, filmed the Hadhramaut, a region that is home to an ancient civilization. The film shows startling scenes of a dense collection of skyscrapers made from mud that were built in the 16th Century. Some are 11 stories high. They are still inhabited to this day. It was in this area that people first learned how to live in concentrated environments. It is sometimes referred to as ""the Manhattan of the desert"". Perhaps the most inspirational films are those shot by two young explorers, George Sherriff and Frank Ludlow, in the 1930s during their journeys through Bhutan and Tibet. The two friends thought they had discovered paradise among the Himalayan mountains. They filmed scenes of a simpler way of life, where people were happy, healthy and lived to a ripe old age. This video can not be played George Sherriff and Frank Ludlow film their ""Shangri-La"" The early colour films reinforce a sense they had found a brighter, more hopeful world - a contrast to the grim desolation of Europe after the First World War, according to Prof Mike Heffernan, of Nottingham University. ""When Sherriff and Ludlow began their exploration of this area in 1933, it is exactly the same year in which James Hilton publishes this famous book called The Lost Horizon, which introduces the idea of 'Shangri-La'; this perfect place. This was a mountain kingdom, a vestigial world of peace and harmony, precisely the world that had been so obviously left behind by the industrial warfare that they'd gone through.""

I took my family on the run for 19 years,"Five years ago a woman walked into a police station in Ozark, Missouri, and claimed her father-in-law was a British fugitive. It was the end of the road for Eddie Maher, who had been on the run - with wife and children in tow - for 19 years. How did one of the UK's most wanted men evade capture for so long? In January 1993, Securicor driver Eddie Maher sped away from Lloyds Bank in Felixstowe in a van containing Â£1.2m ($1.6m). Then he disappeared. Police pursued leads from Cyprus to the Caribbean, but found no trace of Maher - or the money - despite offering a Â£100,000 reward. ""You can live off the grid in plain sight if you're not silly,"" says Maher, now 61. ""Most people get caught because they are ridiculously extravagant."" He succeeded for nearly two decades, choosing the US because he thought it would be the easiest place to lie low. ""The United States is a huge country and everyone speaks the same language, so you don't stand out,"" he says. ""Travelling was more comfortable back then. It was pre-9/11 and there weren't as many checks."" Maher in his Securicor uniform The fireman-turned-security-van-driver flew business class from Heathrow to Dallas, a few weeks after the heist, carrying a suitcase with banknotes wrapped in towels and a fake passport in the name of Stephen King. Maher estimates he had around Â£125,000 ($160,000), the cut he was given by a shadowy gang that he says pressurised him into committing the crime. (Police have always rejected the claim that he was acting under duress.) He had sent his partner, Debbie Brett, on holiday to Boston a few weeks earlier with their toddler, Lee. He only explained to her they were on the run when they met at a pre-arranged spot in Dallas airport, he says. ""She wasn't over the moon when I told her but we're a couple. She's my best friend,"" he says. ""Plus I convinced her she could contact her family after a while."" In fact, Maher knew they couldn't risk contacting loved ones in the UK. He only made one phone call home during his 19 years away - a call to his sick mother, one year after he vanished. ""It was difficult not seeing family, especially for Debbie. Every now and then I'd get a twinge of regret but I made the decision that we were better off over there,"" Maher says. Eddie with his son, Lee, shortly before they went on the run After spending a few weeks assessing their options, Maher and Brett settled with their son in Woodland Park, a small town in Colorado. It was far from the tourist trail so the risk of being recognised was low, and as it was growing quickly, new faces were accepted without too many questions being asked. They paid cash for a four-bedroom house and soon bedded into the community. Proof of address was sufficient to get Lee into nursery and later into elementary school. They introduced themselves as Stephen and Sarah King. According to their cover story, Stephen was a photocopier salesman from Essex who had sold his business and was deciding what to do next. They had a well-rehearsed line when people asked about family and friends in the UK. ""We'd say, 'They've already been over and are welcome to visit any time,'"" Maher says. ""It never got easier telling those stories. I hated lying every day but we had no choice."" Eddie Maher's first house in Woodland Park, Colorado The couple went on hunting and fishing trips with the neighbours, Brett volunteered at the nursery and Maher joined the mountain search and rescue team. He also made friends with people on the local airfield and was given flying lessons in exchange for driving the fuel truck. He later bought his own plane, a Piper Warrior, which he rented back to the flying school. ""I've seen those reality shows like Hunted and I find them quite laughable,"" Maher says. ""Hiding in plain sight is easier."" Maher enjoyed life in Colorado but lived in constant fear of capture. Although his moments of paranoia and anxiety became less frequent over time they never completely went away. In 1994 Maher and Brett got married under their fake names in Las Vegas, acquiring a wedding certificate in the process - another useful document that would help to confirm their fake identities. Debbie and Eddie had a wedding ceremony at a traditional chapel in Las Vegas Maher had already taken driving lessons, even though he had driven for decades, to get a licence in the name of Stephen King. He had used that to open a bank account. In addition, he had forged a California birth certificate for Lee, and applied for a social security card for him so that he could work when he was older. However, he couldn't get Lee a passport. For that he needed a genuine birth certificate, one that could be traced to a birth record in a state ledger. Another document Maher couldn't forge was a green card, and without one neither he nor Brett could work. ""I tried to find jobs where you didn't need ID, like illegal immigrants do. But there isn't much unless you want to go orange-picking in California,"" Maher says. As their funds dwindled, Maher made some money playing blackjack in Las Vegas. The family also moved to a smaller home and sold their plane - and it was when the buyer only paid a quarter of what he had promised that Maher realised it was time to leave. Maher spent $16,000 on a Piper Warrior plane but sold it for a fraction of the price ""When I asked for the money, he said, 'I think there's something shady about you. Maybe I'll call the cops,'"" Maher says. The couple moved hastily to Concord, New Hampshire. At the same time, Maher decided to give up being Stephen King, and hatched a risky plan to assume a different identity. ""My brother, Michael, had married an American years before but had since moved to the UK. I knew he had a legitimate green card and I knew all his details,"" he says. So Maher wrote to the authorities as Michael, claiming he had lost his green card. Then he waited anxiously. But no-one raised the alarm and before long he was sent a replacement in the post. Maher then applied for a commercial driver's licence in his brother's name and started work as a lorry driver. With a steady income now, Maher and Brett settled in to life in Concord. Maher started coaching Little League baseball and in 1997 the couple had another son, Mark. They became friendly with a couple who had a weekend home on a nearby lake, and would often visit. A year later Maher got a job installing Nielsen TV systems, which are used to calculate ratings for TV shows. He only needed one reference from the UK, which he forged. The family stayed in New Hampshire for five years. Then came the 9/11 attacks, and neighbours seemed to become more curious about them. ""It got to the point where our friends would joke, 'You must be in the witness protection programme.' I thought that was a sign we'd probably been there too long,"" Maher says. He successfully applied for a promotion at Nielsen and the family relocated to Dunedin in Florida. Maher was now in tech support and Brett worked cash-in-hand for a house-cleaning business. They rented a home by the beach and Maher took up golf. They would only visit Disney World off-season, to reduce the risk of meeting British tourists. After a few more years, and a few more house moves, Maher and Brett decided to settle down permanently.  In 2008 they moved to the small town of Ozark in Missouri, where Maher found work as a broadband technician, while Brett got another cash-in-hand job, this time with a property-letting agency. Despite this, they began running up credit card bills, and Maher ended up declaring bankruptcy in 2010. But even this didn't lead to his exposure. His weak spot turned out to be his own son, Lee. As a teenager, Lee had begun asking questions about his English relatives and Maher says he began to rebel when he didn't get a straight answer - embarking on a series of short-term relationships, fathering a number of children and regularly getting into trouble. ""My sons had a good upbringing. I taught them to be law-abiding citizens. But when Lee got to the age of being headstrong and stupid that put pressure on us,"" Maher says. ""He was a problem and in the end that's the problem that brought everything to a head."" Lee Maher met and married Jessica Butler but they soon started quarrelling. According to Eddie, a drunken Lee once told Jessica he thought his father was a fugitive. He believes she then searched for his surname online and found old news reports of the Securicor heist, along with the promise of a reward. Eddie and Debbie at a Nielsen Media Research Service Awards On 6 February 2012 she walked into Ozark police station and said she knew the whereabouts of the British fugitive, ""Fast Eddie"" Maher. Maher was then told by a police officer that the authorities knew who he was, and the FBI noted his furious response. ""Maher told his son they would have to leave again and threatened to kill the person who tipped off police about his identity,"" reported federal agent Jeffrey Atwood. But Maher decided not to run. Instead he came clean to his sons. ""My real name is Eddie,"" he said. ""And your mum isn't Sarah. She's Debbie."" In July 2012 he was extradited to the UK. Eight months later he was sentenced to five years for theft, but was released in January 2015. ""I don't grumble, I don't say I didn't do the crime. I did my time for it,"" Maher says. He is philosophical about spending 19 years looking over his shoulder. ""I don't regret my life in America. My second son was born there and if I hadn't gone through this he may never have been born. It's been my life and we've adapted,"" he says. He would like to return to America, this time as Eddie Maher, but his criminal conviction means that this is impossible. He doesn't want to stay in the UK though, and fancies a place in the sun - Spain perhaps, or Cyprus. ""We'll keep our heads down,"" he says, ""and enjoy a bit of a retirement.""

TV show triggers Chinese virginity debate,"""He asked me whether I am a virgin,"" says Qiu Yingying, bursting into tears. She has just found out her relationship with boyfriend Ying Qin is over, after he found out she had had sex in the past. The scene from China's biggest soap opera right now, Ode to Joy, has triggered much discussion on whether virginity is still a prized asset for women in modern China. Ode to Joy, now in its second season, tells the stories of five beautiful women from different walks of life who live in the same floor of an apartment complex in Shanghai. The show, a less risque version of Sex and the City, is popular among women for its focus on romance, careers, friendships and the difficulties women face in the big city. Qiu Yingying is a young but naive character, who values her relationship over everything else. In the scene, she holds a dinner party to introduce her boyfriend to her friends, but the evening turns dramatic after her neighbour accidentally exposes her past relationship. In the drama, Ying Qin thinks having sex before marriage is a bad thing for a woman Her boyfriend, Ying Qin, storms off, furious. Yingying's flatmate, Fan Shengmei, goes on to confront Ying Qin after he dumps her, generating this exchange; Ying Qin: She didn't deny it and she can't blame others [for their reaction]. Fan Shengmei: Can't you be tolerant to the girl you love, and who loves you? Ying Qin: How can I trust that a person who disgraces herself has the ability to love me? Fan Shengmei: Do you consider it's disgraceful to have sex before marriage? Sex education in China is often poor. There are stories of male biology teachers skipping details of the female reproductive system in class and asking students to learn it by themselves. And parents very rarely share information about sex with their children. What almost all parents do, however, is warn their daughters not to have any dates before they graduate from university, fearing that they get hurt or become pregnant. Chinese communities also traditionally expect chastity before marriage. That means TV dramas are very influential in shaping audiences' values. They are windows for young audiences, especially young women, to understand sex and sexuality and the ways views are changing. Zi Yin, a Shanghai-based film assistant producer, told the BBC that even debating the topic was old-fashioned in the 21st Century. She thought it was ""disgusting"" for the show to make an issue of it. Urban Chinese people are less likely to place a high value on sexual purity for women In modern cities, women are more independent and liberated, she said. ""The virginity issue doesn't trouble those well-educated women in China's big cities like Shanghai and Shenzhen,"" she told the BBC ""The independent and smart ladies are educated and encouraged to become China's female president or to achieve high in their career."" Why millions of Chinese men are staying single Emotional advert about China's ""leftover women"" goes viral But not everyone agrees the virginity debate is over. One of Ode to Joy's female fans, Ziye Pei, told the BBC it was perfectly reasonable for a boyfriend who was a virgin himself to require his girlfriend to be so. The only problem, she said, was if it was a double standard and the man expected chastity from a woman but not himself. The issue was also being discussed by her university classmates in a social media group chat on China's Twitter-like site, WeChat. Someone questioned why there wasn't gender equality when it came to chastity, but another said she couldn't accept Ying Qin's comment on women who had sex before marriage. In the show, Qiu Yingying's friends rally around to comfort her, encouraging her to have hope in the broken relationship. It remains to be seen whether Ying Qin will have a change of heart and take her back, or whether she decides she's better off without him. But the many online forums around Ode to Joy are putting their hope in promotional videos, which seem to suggest they find a way around this dilemma and get back together.

The secret behind healthy Greek hearts,"Elderly villagers are well known for their good health and long lives Scientists have pinpointed one reason why people living in isolated villages in Greece may enjoy long and healthy lives. They found a new genetic variant, common among villagers, which appears to protect the heart by lowering levels of ""bad"" fats and cholesterol. Despite a diet rich in animal fat, the people of Mylopotamos in northern Crete do not suffer from cardiovascular disease. And they really love their cheese. The isolated villages of Zoniana and Anogia are high up in the mountains on the island of Crete. Few people move in or out of the villages and the inhabitants are known for living well into old age. Heart problems, heart attacks and strokes - all types of cardiovascular disease - are rare, and that's despite a diet which includes plenty of lamb and local Cretan cheese. There is a cheese festival held every year in the villages, by the way. Well, this kind of diet would normally be a recipe for lots of health complications. That's because eating foods that contain saturated fats raises the level of cholesterol in the blood, and high levels of low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in the blood increase the risk of heart disease and stroke. The villagers do get type 2 diabetes at the same rate as the general Greek population, but they don't seem to suffer from the usual consequences, such as diabetic kidney disease. The village of Zoniana is located high in the mountains of Crete That's exactly what researchers from theWellcome Trust Sanger Institute,externalwanted to know. Was there something in the villagers' genetic make-up that protected their hearts against disease? Their research, published inNature Communications,external, identified a new genetic variant which has heart-protecting qualities. It is associated with lower levels of ""bad"" natural fats and ""bad"" cholesterol - which are important for lowering the risk of cardiovascular disease. The variant appears to be virtually unique to the population of the two mountain villages. Out of thousands of Europeans who have undergone genome sequencing, only one other person in Italy possesses this variant, the researchers said. Grilled lamb is a traditional Greek dish To solve the puzzle, they sequenced the entire genome of 250 villagers. That means they took blood samples, extracted the DNA - the operating instructions for each one of us which determine how we look and who we are - and analysed a string of three billion letters which make up their human genome. Then they used the results to get a more detailed view of more than 3,000 villagers who had already been through genotyping (a shortcut to acquiring some genetic information). Cretan cheese is a major part of the diet because it is made locally This discovery isn't a reason to go out and eat your weight in animal fat and cheese. That wouldn't be recommended at all - because the rest of us don't possess this genetic variant. But scientists say they can use their discovery to work out which genetic variants play a role in causing complex diseases. This can give clues as to why some people develop heart disease and some don't. In this study, using this isolated population, they found a genetic variant no-one had seen before - and it's linked to the most common cause of death worldwide, cardiovascular disease. But there's still much to find out. Scientists can't tell why the variant is present - it could be to do with how the villagers live their lives, the environment they live in or it could have been passed down the generations. Very. Other research teams are looking at different isolated populations, such as the Amish in the United States, the Inuit in northern Greenland and the Orkney Islanders, in Scotland, to see what else they can discover about the secrets to staying healthy.

Facebook's tentacles reach further than you think,"Vladan Joler says that all Facebook users are effectively working on behalf of the company Facebook's collection of data makes it one of the most influential organisations in the world. Share Lab wanted to look ""under the bonnet"" at the tech giant's algorithms and connections to better understand the social structure and power relations within the company. A couple of years ago, Vladan Joler and his brainy friends in Belgrade began investigating the inner workings of one of the world's most powerful corporations. The team, which includes experts in cyber-forensic analysis and data visualisation, had already looked into what he calls ""different forms of invisible infrastructures"" behind Serbia's internet service providers. But Mr Joler and his friends, now working under a project calledShare Lab,external, had their sights set on a bigger target. ""If Facebook were a country, it would be bigger than China,"" says Mr Joler, whose day job is as a professor at Serbia's Novi Sad University. He reels off the familiar, but still staggering, numbers: the barely teenage Silicon Valley firm stores some 300 petabytes of data, boasts almost two billion users, and raked in almost $28bn (Â£22bn) in revenues in 2016 alone. And yet, Mr Joler argues, we know next to nothing about what goes on under the bonnet - despite the fact that we, as users, are providing most of the fuel - for free. ""All of us, when we are uploading something, when we are tagging people, when we are commenting, we are basically working for Facebook,"" he says. Part of a huge flow chart mapping the influence and connections of Mark Zuckerberg The data our interactions provide feeds the complex algorithms that power the social media site, where, as Mr Joler puts it, our behaviour is transformed into a product. Trying to untangle that largely hidden process proved to be a mammoth task. ""We tried to map all the inputs, the fields in which we interact with Facebook, and the outcome,"" he says. ""We mapped likes, shares, search, update status, adding photos, friends, names, everything our devices are saying about us, all the permissions we are giving to Facebook via apps, such as phone status, wifi connection and the ability to record audio."" All of this research provided only a fraction of the full picture. So the team looked into Facebook's acquisitions, and scoured its myriad patent filings. The results were astonishing. Visually arresting flow charts that take hours to absorb fully, but which show how the data we give Facebook is used to calculate our ethnic affinity (Facebook's term), sexual orientation, political affiliation, social class, travel schedule and much more. Share Lab presents its information in minutely detailed tables and flow charts One map shows how everything - from the links we post on Facebook, to the pages we like, to our online behaviour in many other corners of cyber-space that are owned or interact with the company (Instagram, WhatsApp or sites that merely use your Facebook log-in) - could all be entering a giant algorithmic process. And that process allows Facebook to target users with terrifying accuracy, with the ability to determine whether they like Korean food, the length of their commute to work, or their baby's age. Another map details the permissions many of us willingly give Facebook via its many smartphone apps, including the ability to read all text messages, download files without permission, and access our precise location. Individually, these are powerful tools; combined they amount to a data collection engine that, Mr Joler argues, is ripe for exploitation. ""If you think just about cookies, just about mobile phone permissions, or just about the retention of metadata - each of those things, from the perspective of data analysis, are really intrusive."" How Cuba's growing internet is fuelling new businesses How DNA-testing kits are becoming big business 'You can tell by the way I use my walk...' Seeing the light: How India is embracing solar power Facebook has for years asserted that data privacy and the security of its operations are paramount. Facebook data, for example, cannot be used by developers to create surveillance tools and the firm says it complies with privacy protection laws in all countries. Thousands of new staff have been recruited to police its content. Mr Joler, though, while admitting that his research made him a little paranoid about the information that was being harvested, is more worried about the longer term. The data will remain in the hands of one company. Even if its current leaders are responsible and trustworthy, what about those in charge in 20 years? Analysts say Share Lab's work is valuable and impressive. ""It's probably the most comprehensive work mapping Facebook that I've ever seen,"" says Dr Julia Powles, an expert in technology law and policy at Cornell Tech. ""[The research] shows in cold and calculated terms how much we are giving away for the value of being able to communicate with your mates,"" she says. The scale of Facebook's reach can be stated in raw numbers - but Share Lab's maps make it visceral, in a way that drawing parallels cannot. ""We haven't really got appropriate historical analogies for the tech giants,"" explains Dr Powles. Their powers, she continues, extend ""far beyond"" the likes of the East India Company and monopolies of old, such as Standard Oil. And while many may consider the objectives of Mark Zuckerberg's empire to be rather benign, its outcomes are not always so. Facebook, argues Dr Powles, ""plays to our base psychological impulses"" by valuing popularity above all else. Experts say there are no historical analogies for the power that today's tech giants hold Not that she expects Share Lab's research to lead to a mass Facebook exodus, or a dramatic increase in the scrutiny of tech titans. ""What is most striking is the sense of resignation, the impotence of regulation, the lack of options, the public apathy,"" says Dr Powles. ""What an extraordinary situation for an entity that has power over information - there is no greater power really."" It is this extraordinary dominance that the Share Lab team set out to illustrate. But Mr Joler is quick to point out that even their grand maps cannot provide an accurate picture of the social media giant's capabilities. There is no guarantee, for example, that there are not many other algorithms at work that are still heavily guarded trade secrets. However, Mr Joler argues, ""it is still the one and only map that exists"" of one of the greatest forces shaping our world today.

Independent thinking drives Scotland split,"Sandy Cooper is thinking of switching to the Conservatives Class used to be an accurate indicator of voting habits - but that's no longer the case. In the second of a three-part Divided Kingdom series for BBC Newsnight, Katie Razzall reports from Scotland on how the political divisions between nationalists and unionists are playing out in this election. InYougov's latest data,externallooking at Scottish voting intentions this election, there is a clear divide emerging between those who want an independent Scotland and those who want to remain in the Union. About three-quarters of people who voted for independence are voting for the SNP. Almost nine out of 10 (86%) of those who voted No are voting for the three unionist parties. The majority - 49% - are voting for the Tories; 27% for Labour and 10% for the Liberal Democrats. It suggests that three years on from Scotland's independence referendum, the question of whether the country should split from the UK is still very much in play. The First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has argued the vote by 62% of Scots to remain in the EU last year means there should be a second independence referendum, and that an independent Scotland could stay within the EU. Will education be the key factor? Live: Election updates All you need to know about the general election Scottish voters who don't want to leave the Union may see this election as a chance to send that message to their government. Professor John Curtice, of Strathclyde University, says the vote is heading towards a somewhat different outcome from that in 2015. ""It's worth remembering that at the last election, the SNP won 50% of the vote. The party still dominates the electoral scene in Scotland. ""But it's facing a different principal challenger this time round, in the form of a revived Conservative Party rather than a declining Labour Party."" East Renfrewshire is the kind of constituency the Conservatives hope to win, with their tactic of talking up their opposition to a second referendum at every opportunity. It was a safe Conservative seat until 1997 when Jim Murphy won it for Labour. In 2015, the SNP took it, along with 55 other Scottish seats - out of a national total of 59. Labour, too, aims to recapture East Renfrewshire, but the message that it's the Conservatives who will safeguard the union seems to have made its mark on some local voters. At Mearns golf academy, Newsnight spoke to a retired consultant who's voted Labour all his life. Gordon Canning: ""Many people in Scotland do not want independence"" Gordon Canning told us it was a difficult thing to say he might vote Conservative, but ""I want the SNP to be aware that there are a large number of people in Scotland that do not want independence."" Another golfer, Sandy Cooper, said he won't vote for the Liberal Democrats this time, as he usually does, because they aren't in the running in East Renfrewshire. Mr Cooper says Labour is ""no longer a credible opposition"" and he plans to vote tactically ""to get the SNP out"". And Ralph Izzott told us he had never voted before the Independence Referendum. He turned out to vote No. Now he says he will vote again in this election - and it will be Conservative to show his outrage at the idea of an independent Scotland. Voting Conservative isn't a young person's game here. While 40% of over-65s are voting Tory in Scotland, only 20% of under-50s are. In Glasgow's Yes Bar, a drinks and comedy venue that was renamed in the run-up to the independence referendum, compere Chrissy Ross opens his routine with a series of jokes at the expense of the Conservatives who have recently taken seats in the local elections, even here in Glasgow - SNP heartland, and before that the domain of Scottish Labour. Chrissy Ross wants a second independence referendum He told us he will vote SNP because he wants a second referendum, so Scotland doesn't have to leave the EU. Interestingly, Ray Doull, the dance teacher at a rock-and-roll class at the Grand Ole Opry, also plans to vote SNP, though he voted to leave the EU in last year's referendum because ""every country should govern itself"". According to Prof Curtice's analysis, at least a quarter of those who voted for the SNP in 2015 went against their party's stance in 2016 and voted to leave. ""It looks as though this group may account for a significant proportion of the loss in SNP support since then. ""It looks as if the nationalist pro-Brexiters may have defected from the party. The SNP may have lost the support of some of its more Eurosceptic voters, in some cases perhaps to the Conservatives.""

Sangakkara shines with fifth ton in row,"Kumar Sangakkara confirmed on Monday he will retire from first-class cricket in September Specsavers County Championship Division One, Cloudfm County Ground Surrey 334-7:Sangakkara 177*, S Curran 90, Meaker 43*; Quinn 3-66 Essex:Yet to bat Surrey 3 pts, Essex 2 pts Match scorecard Kumar Sangakkara's fifth successive first-class century led a remarkable recovery for Surrey against Essex. The Sri Lankan finished unbeaten on 177 as Surrey closed on 334-7 having been reduced to 31-5 in the opening hour of a sun-drenched first day at Chelmsford. Sam Curran (90) shared a 191-run partnership with Sangakkara for the sixth wicket while Stuart Meaker (43 not out) added more tail-end runs. Seamer Matt Quinn (3-66) had earlier prospered with the new ball for Essex. Sangakkara's past five County Championship innings have produced scores of 136, 105, 114, 120 and 177 not out and he has now scored 769 runs this season at an average of 128.16. In between, he also struck an unbeaten 124 in Surrey's final One-Day Cup group match against Hampshire. Five successive first-class centuries is a Surrey record and Sangakkara became the first player to achieve the feat since Mike Hussey for Northamptonshire in 2003. He was let off on 46 when former England Test captain Alastair Cook dropped a sharp chance at first slip off Neil Wagner, which brought up his half-century in the process. And the left-hander, who confirmed on Monday he will retire from the first-class game in September, moved to his century in 173 balls and then passed 150 off 247 deliveries. Essex, who started the day top of Division One and a point ahead of second-placed Surrey, were in charge early on after Quinn and Jamie Porter (2-70) had accounted for the top order. But by the close, Sangakkara and Meaker had added an unbroken 95 for the eighth wicket to move within sight of a fourth batting point. Surrey all-rounder Sam Curran told BBC Radio London: ""It was amazing [batting with Kumar Sangakkara], I didn't really expect that at 11:30, I'd be in batting with him, especially after winning the toss. ""Fair play to the Essex guys, they bowled top of off stump and made a good pitch look like a good bowling wicket. ""But, batting with Kumar was probably only the third or fourth time I have in four-day cricket. ""We're going to miss him at the end of the year when he goes, but we're going to take in whatever we can right now. ""It was literally incredible batting with him. He told us to dig in deep to start with and just take 20 minutes at a time and then go from there. ""He helped me through the way and that's the best time to score runs when the team needs you. ""I'm gutted to miss out on a hundred, but the main thing is we finished the day in a good position and I definitely think it was our day.""

Manchester finds strength in music,"This video can not be played Crowds sing Don't Look Back in Anger after minute's silence The Manchester attack may have tested the city's resolve, but people are finding light in the darkness through its twin loves of music and sport. If Monday's bombing was an attempt to interrupt the lifestyles of proud Mancunians then it has failed, say figures from the city's vibrant entertainment scene. Manchester's two time-honoured traditions of gigs and sporting events are continuing, with a renewed sense of defiance. Football rivalries have been put to one side, with fans coming together towish Manchester United wellafter the Red Devils' Europa League triumph, and the Great Manchester Run - Europe's largest 10km event -will go ahead on Sunday. Indie rock band The Charlatans will hold their long-planned musical takeover of the city's Oldham Street on Friday, just a five-minute walk away from the scene of the blast, and former Oasis singer Liam Gallagher will make his live solo debut at the Ritz venue on Tuesday, with the profits going to the fund set up to support the victims of the attack. And rugby league's Salford Red Devils are offering fansfree entry to their gameat AJ Bell Stadium on Friday in return for a donation to the same fund. Members of the public have been laying floral tributes and messages in St Ann's Square Several other gigs have gone ahead in the aftermath of the attack. On Tuesday, the day after the tragedy, a Simple Minds concert went ahead in the city after the band said cancelling their show would have felt ""cowardly"". The same night, former Smiths guitarist Johnny Marr made a surprise appearance with Broken Social Scene at the Albert Hall. Dave Haslam, a writer and former DJ at the Hacienda, said music could be part of a ""great healing process"". Special report on Manchester concert attack Who were the victims of the bombing? Mobile phone 'saved woman's life' ""As a DJ for 35 years I've seen dance floors in front of me packed with people from all ages, backgrounds, ethnic groups and sexualities, united under the glitter ball"" he said. ""That is really what life in Manchester is like. That is who we are."" Mr Haslam, who has arrangeda fundraising event,externalfor victims of the attack, said Manchester people ""measure out their lives in musical events"". ""That's true whether it's young kids going to Manchester Arena or students coming to the city to go to obscure Northern Quarter venues, or older people, who still go to gigs,"" he said. Manchester United fans put on a show of unity at the team's triumphant Europa League final on Wednesday ""Music is seen as something that brings us together."" The point was underlined in the city on Thursday, whencrowds broke out into a rendition of Oasis's hit Don't Look Back in Angerafter observing a minute's silence. Manchester music historian Paul Wild said there was a grim irony in the fact that Monday's attack targeted a concert. ""It's an unpleasant thought to think that this will be in the city's history for ever more,"" he said. ""This city is so strong in its musical heritage. It's been very touching to see the response."" Mr Wild drew attention to similar scenes of unity after the Paris attacks of November 2015. Co-ordinated attacks on a concert at the Bataclan theatre, restaurants, cafes and the Stade de France football stadium left 130 people dead. Comparisons have been made with other cities which have responded to massacres, including Paris Heavy metal band Eagles of Death Metal later returned to the Bataclan for a performance in memory of the victims. Mr Wild said: ""I can imagine that we might see something like that in Manchester. ""I think we could see a huge musical event planned in the months ahead. Perhaps an event back at the Arena."" In sport, Manchester United dedicated the team's cup final win over Dutch side Ajax to the victims of the bombing. The club and Manchester City later announced they hadjointly pledged Â£1m to an emergency fundset up to support survivors and their families. Wednesday night's match in Stockholm was described as ""a release"" by United fan and football writer Andy Mitten. More than 300,000 people have taken part in the Great Manchester Run Mr Mitten, who edits the fanzine United We Stand, said: ""Stories were starting to seep through at the match about friends of friends affected by the attack. Lots of people know people who died or had been seriously injured. ""It almost allowed people to forget about it for a while and relegate it from their minds for a few hours. ""But as Jose Mourinho said, you would swap everything for just one life."" David Hart, one of the organisers behind the Great Manchester Run, said there had been an ""overwhelming desire"" for the event to go ahead. ""The final decision rested with Greater Manchester Police and the council, but now it's our job to deliver,"" he said. ""The clamour for the run to happen was just absolutely phenomenal. I've never seen anything like it."" Tributes to the victims of Monday's bombing can be seen across the city Mr Hart said there would be three separate minutes of silence held at the various start points for the run. Psychologist Dr Tom Fawcett said it was human nature or, as he phrases it, ""human spirit"" for people to unite after traumatic events. The specialist in mental resilience said: ""You see it throughout history. During the Second World War, after the London bombings and the attacks on the Twin Towers. ""In New York particularly, it was incredible how that city was transformed. ""Individually, it's very difficult for people to deal with trauma. We don't have the coping skills. But collective strength is stronger. You see it in football, with siege mentality. ""This time it's a whole city that's been ripped apart, and a whole country that's been emotionally scarred. ""Ultimately this atrocity will make Manchester a stronger city. But it's a terrible price to pay.""

Why does the Prevent strategy divide opinion?,"In the aftermath of the Manchester Arena bomb attack, the government's approach to tackling radicalisation has once again come under scrutiny. Reality Check has been looking at the government's Prevent programme - asking how it works and why it divides opinion. Prevent is one of four strands of the government's counter-terrorism strategy, known as Contest. It was created by the Labour government in 2003 and its remit was widened by the coalition government in 2011. The other strands are: Prepare; Protect; and Pursue. Prevent is designed to support people at risk of joining extremist groups and carrying out terrorist activities. In practice it means police and other organisations trying to build relations across the UK and putting programmes in places such as schools, faith organisations, prisons and other communities where people can be at risk of radicalisation. It requires faith leaders, teachers, doctors and others to refer any suspicions to a local Prevent body. An assessment is then made about whether further action is needed. Social services departments have become increasingly involved in identifying Prevent cases because of their duty to counter radicalisation. About 7,500 referrals were made to the scheme in 2015-16 - the equivalent of 20 a day - according to a Freedom of Information Request to the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC). Out of those referrals, action was taken in one in every 10 cases. No action at all was taken in 37% of the cases, while a quarter of people referred were found to be vulnerable but not at risk of terrorist involvement. The remaining 28% were still being considered. In cases where an ideology was recorded, just over half related to Islamist extremism and nearly one in 10 were linked to far-right extremism. In some areas of the country, including parts of north-west England, the number of far-right referrals far outstrips the number of Islamist cases. Where action is taken, an individual can be placed on the government's Channel Programme. This is a support plan which may include mentoring. The annual Prevent budget is not officially published - but it is thought to be around Â£40m a year. We do know that after therevised strategy was published,externalin 2011, the government set aside Â£46m of spending (Â£36m from the Home Office and Â£10m from the Foreign Office). David Anderson - the former independent reviewer of terror legislation - has said Prevent receives 1% of the overall Â£3bn counter-terrorism budget. While the Prevent strategy has divided opinion, the government says it is working. Itsays 150 people, including 50 children, were stopped from entering conflict zones in Iraq and Syria in 2015 because of the strategy.,external The government also says that its counter-radicalisation programmes reached more than 42,000 people in 2015/16. The strategy is also backed by senior police figures. The Leicestershire Chief Constable Simon Colehas called it ""absolutely fundamental"" in tackling terrorism in the UK. He said the scheme was about ""putting an arm around"" people at risk of radicalisation: ""We try and divert, allow people the opportunity to help them make better decisions. It's absolutely fundamental. It has enabled us to try and help stabilise communities and stop people getting us into a cycle of aggravation."" The Prevent strategy has been criticised by some MPs, the National Union of Teachers and the Muslim Council of Britain. Some argue the strategy is counterproductive and that it can make Islamic students, for example, feel isolated and possibly more open to radicalisation. Another worry is that it can add to a general sense of distrust across communities. A former senior Muslim police officer, Dal Babu, said in 2015 that Prevent had become ""tainted"" and ""toxic"". He argued that Muslim community organisations ""have this Prevent [label] stamped on them and are then vilified"". The Muslim Council of Britain says Prevent is too intrusive and references are over-zealous. It gives an example of two college students stopped by a lecturer who noticed that they had made way for two female students and lowered their gaze. The Council says they were reported to the senior team for ""concerning behaviour"". Another problem is that it is very difficult to measure the full extent of the strategy's successes and failures. It is impossible to know how many people may or may not have gone on to commit terrorist acts without coming into contact with Prevent. TheConservative manifesto,externaldoes not make specific mention to Prevent. It does, however, say: ""We will continue to invest in our world-leading security services and maintain and develop our counter-terrorism strategy to protect us from terrorism at home and abroad."" Speaking toBBC Radio 4's Today programmein the aftermath of the Manchester attack, Home Secretary Amber Rudd said that if the Conservatives were re-elected, the strategy would receive more money. Labour's manifesto,externalpledges to review the Prevent programme with a view to assessing both its effectiveness and its potential to alienate minority communities. It says: ""In doing so, we will address the government's failure to take any effective new measures against a growing problem of extreme or violent radicalisation."" The Liberal Democrats say they will scrap Prevent altogether.Its manifesto,externalsays it will ""replace it with a scheme that prioritises community engagement and supports communities in developing their own approach to tackling the dangers of violent extremism"". The SNP is yet to publish its manifesto. However the party has previouslycalled for a review into Prevent,,externalsaying the strategy leads to ""confusion and alienation and risks being significantly counter-productive"". UKIP's manifesto,externaldoes not explicitly mention Prevent. The party did pledge, however, to segregate extremists from the wider prison population to prevent a spread of radicalisation.

The Stanley Matthews football revolution made in Ghana,"Sir Stanley Matthews remains one of England's most famous footballers and was known as the Wizard of Dribble. But he was also arguably the first global icon, paving the way for superstars such as Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi. And it all began in Ghana, writes Scott Anthony. Football is the closest thing the planet has to a global popular culture. Wherever you go in the world, you'll find people kicking a ball around, watching matches in cafes, wearing replica shirts, and betting or playing football games on their phones. Yet the idea of a footballer as a global icon is a relatively recent phenomenon. The idea that a footballer could bring nations, classes and races together had to be invented. And it was an idea that was arguably invented in Africa. The story begins 60 years ago in Ghana when veteran English footballer Stanley Matthews strode out to play for Accra's Hearts of Oak against Kumasi Kotoko. Newly crowned as the first European Player of the Year, Matthews came to Ghana to play a series of exhibition matches to celebrate independence. Some Ghanaian players were star-struck playing alongside Matthews Matthews was installed as a ""soccerhene"" (soccer chief) ""Matthews' visit had a tremendous impact,"" says football writer Fiifi Anaman. ""When I spoke with some of the players about it, they said they couldn't believe Matthews came - it felt almost as if a god was walking among them."" The media had hyped up the visit, speculating how local hero Baba Yara, ""Ghana's King of Wingers"", would measure up against the superstar of European soccer. Matthews was mobbed on arrival and more than 80,000 spectators turned up to watch his first three matches against Kotoko, Sekondi Hasaacas and Kumasi Cornerstone. Shortly after his arrival, Matthews was presented with an ivory sword and installed as a ""soccerhene"" (soccer chief) in front of the press. Matthews' tour of the region led people to compare European and African styles of football. Newspapers emphasised that Matthews rarely ran, played corners short and almost never passed the ball off the ground. He avoided heading the ball. His visit prompted calls for Ghanaians to prioritise teamwork and alertness over effort and physicality. Ghana's first President, Kwame Nkrumah (r), was inspired by Matthews visit to use sport as a national unifier Even more importantly, Matthews arrived as Ghana's first President, Kwame Nkrumah, was trying to create an identity for Ghana - a country knitted together from numerous different ethnic groups under colonial rule. Removing the portrait of Elizabeth II from stamps and coins was  easy but it was more difficult to create new symbols capable of bringing the new nation together. In particular, President Nkrumah stressed the need for real-life examples. He wanted to emphasise the idea that you live your values rather than passively inherit them. Born 1 February 1915 in Stoke Played for Stoke City, Blackpool and England Did not smoke or consume alcohol and drank carrot juice every day Known as the Wizard of Dribble Won only major trophy in ""Matthews Final"", when Blackpool beat Bolton 4-3 in 1953 Won inaugural European Footballer of the Year award in 1956 On 15 May 1957, aged 42 and 103 days, became the oldest person to play for England 1965: First footballer to be knighted Never booked or sent off Died aged 85 in 2000 - his ashes are buried beneath the centre circle at Stoke's stadium The story of Sir Stanley Matthews,external The success of Matthews' tour helped convince Mr Nkrumah that sport could also play a significant role in the dissemination of African values. At this defining moment, Matthews was playing alongside the early greats of Ghanaian football such as James Adjaye, Chris Briandt and CK Gyamfi, who would go on to define that greatness. Ultimately, Ghana's president believed that sport was the perfect vehicle for the expression of pan-African idealism. ""By meeting together in the field of sport,"" Mr Nkrumah said, ""the youth of Africa will learn what our elders were prevented from learning - that all Africans are brothers with a common destiny."" In the years immediately after independence, Ghanaian football would not only serve as a vehicle for the development of what the president termed ""the African personality"" but be invested with the hope that it could help build a new kind of global solidarity. The England international, aged 42 when he arrived in Ghana, was a compelling if unusual figure. He had become a celebrity during World War Two when Allied authorities promoted the matches of touring All Star XIs to keep up morale in war zones. Here Matthews was a propagandist's dream. In addition to his amazing dribbling ability, he was never booked and lived an ascetic life. The contrast between Matthews' modesty and the icons of Fascist sport could not be clearer. Matthews also played and coached in Kenya Matthews' stringent fitness regime allowed him to play professional football until the age of 50 After Matthews' Blackpool beat Bolton in the 1953 FA Cup final, popularly known as ""the Matthews final"", his fame was propelled worldwide through newsreels and television. Affection for ""Our Stan"" grew as his stringent fitness regime allowed him to play professional football until the age of 50. During his visit, Ghanaian newspapers labelled him ""the Saint of Soccer"" as he visited schools and hospitals. Independent Ghana required its own brand of heroic gentlemen. Approachable but exceptional, the example of the ""soccerhene"" encouraged Ghana's government to make sport and sports stars central to their project. As independence spread throughout the African continent, Mr Nkrumah's use of sport for nation-building would be widely imitated. Later in the 1960s, it would become fashionable for icons of global sport, from Pele to Muhammad Ali, to make pilgrimages to newly independent African states. Immediately after Matthews' visit, the Englishman George Ainsley was appointed manager of the national team, the ""Black Stars"". Ghana became the first African nation to tour Eastern Europe and the first sub-Saharan African nation to qualify for the Olympic Games. In 1963 CK Gyamfi would coach Ghana to victory in the African Cup of Nations, a trophy they retained in 1965. Mr Nkrumah also pushed Fifa to guarantee a spot for an African side at the World Cup, which was introduced afterAfrican nations boycotted the 1966 World Cup. Matthews himself would become a regular visitor to Africa, playing and coaching in countries such as Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa. Archbishop Desmond Tutu said Matthews' visit to Soweto had dented the armoury of apartheid South Africa In later life he favourably contrasted the collective spirit of African football, especially in Soweto, with the economic bigotry he saw taking over the game in the UK. ""Going into the townships at a time when racial discrimination was at its most intense [was] something that had all kinds of ramifications,"" remembered Archbishop Desmond Tutu. ""It made a dent in the apartheid armoury."" In Ghana, President Nkrumah's politicisation of football would prove a double-edged sword, as the regime's centralising and authoritarian tendencies eventually brought the league into disrepute and fanned regional factionalism. Internationally, however, African governmental activism broke the European and South American duopoly over football and in the process the idea that football was an uncontainable and universalising global force was born.

Is Malta really Europe's 'pirate base' for tax?,"Malta joined the EU in 2004 and adopted the euro in 2008 ""Offshore"", ""tax haven"" and more recently ""Panama in the EU"" are labels that Malta has done its best to shake off. But when a team of journalists declared that the tiny Mediterranean island was a ""pirate base for tax avoidance"", it sent ripples of concern across the EU. Malta currently holds the presidency of the European Union, so the allegations are all the more sensitive. And they come at the tail end of a bitter election campaign that has seen the island's Labour government fending off serious claims of corruption, ahead of a vote on 3 June. Malta operates a tax system where companies pay the lowest tax on profits in the EU. While local businesses must pay 35% on profits, international corporations profit from a corporation tax rate of as little as 5%, thanks to a complex system where shareholders can receive a tax refund of up to six-sevenths of their tax paid in Malta. The average rate in the EU is around 22%. Several EU countries say such a system damages their budgets and reveals a weakness in the EU, which allows the 28 member states sovereign rights over their taxation. According to a report commissioned by Green MEPs in the European Parliament, Malta helped multinationals avoid paying â¬14bn (Â£12bn;$15.6bn) in taxes between 2012 and 2015, which would have gone to other EU countries. Juncker under fire over Luxembourg's tax regime Prime Minister Joseph Muscat (bottom left) hosted fellow EU leaders in Malta in February The EU wants to stop companies setting up ""letter-box subsidiaries"" in countries solely to qualify for a softer tax regime. That is a situation the Maltese company registry is all too familiar with. The fight against tax avoidance is one of the European Commission's main priorities - its president, Jean-Claude Juncker, recently had to explain his own conduct as prime minister of Luxembourg. On May 19, a network of journalists released their findings after digging into more than 150,000 documents. Describing them as the ""Malta Files"",external, the group said they showed how international companies were taking advantage of the Maltese tax system. They also claimed Malta had become a target for firms linked to the Italian mafia and Russian loan sharks. It came just two weeks after Norbert Walter-Borjans, the finance minister in Germany's most populous state, North Rhine-Westphalia, singled out Malta as ""the Panama of Europe"". What are the Panama Papers all about? It is a highly sensitive subject for Malta's leadership, as just over a year ago one of the revelations from the huge leak of documents known as the Panama Papers was that the Maltese prime minister's chief of staff and a prominent minister held secret companies in Panama. Malta says it is under siege, insisting big countries are anxious to bite off a good chunk of revenue made by the EU's smallest state. A holiday island - but Malta rejects comparisons with offshore tax havens The tax system has been jealously guarded by different Maltese governments, with successive prime ministers arguing there is nothing secretive about Malta's registry of companies and that controlling tax policy is the only tool left for small EU countries to remain competitive. Malta country profile After the ""Malta Files"" were divulged, Finance Minister Edward Scicluna told reporters: ""Do not underestimate the attempts to bully a small country."" Mr Scicluna has striven to explain that the Maltese authorities share company and banking information whenever asked to do so by foreign jurisdictions. Prime Minister Joseph Muscat added: ""Our register is more transparent than Germany's or Luxembourg's. Our competitive edge is like giving a manufacturing company land on the cheap to encourage it to set up a factory in our country."" Ex-Finance Minister Tonio Fenech told the BBC it all boils down to tax competition. ""It's not Malta's problem that it has an attractive tax jurisdiction. It's the problem of other EU states that don't. Why should I increase my tax rates to please Germany or France? A lot of countries should look at the way their tax system has killed off business and led to unemployment."" Mr Fenech served for nine years as finance minister and oversaw the tax system when Malta joined the EU in 2004. He said the island had nothing to hide. Its corporate tax system was sanctioned by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and is in line with the EU's freedom of establishment. In 2014 EU pressure forced Malta to change its cash-for-passports scheme Mr Fenech insisted there was no fool-proof system anywhere to weed out questionable companies: ""There's VAT evasion, money laundering all over Europe. What I can assure you is we have a lot of stringent rules."" Malta's economic success has been overshadowed by corruption scandals that go to the core of the Labour government elected in 2013. The government has been under siege since the Panama Papers revealed details of secret companies in Panama. Those revelations have cast doubt on its ability to push through anti-money laundering legislation. Simon Busuttil, leader of the centre-right Nationalist Party, said the corruption that gripped the Muscat government was the main reason Malta was being subjected to closer scrutiny. The so-called Individual Investor Programme scheme, which enabled Malta to raise millions by selling its passports to rich foreigners, is at the centre of an inquiry, after Mr Busuttil claimed he had evidence to prove the prime minister's chief of staff was receiving kickbacks off the scheme. Malta tightens passport sale terms TheEuropean Parliament's ""Pana"" Committee,external, probing the Panama Papers, has summoned both Mr Muscat and his chief of staff for a hearing in June. Vice-chairperson Ana Gomes said: ""All these scandals relating to Panama are harming Malta's image and the EU's. We're very concerned about the systems, or the apparent lack of them, to prevent the island from being used for activities of money laundering and proceeds of crime."" Though Joseph Muscat and Simon Busuttil are worlds apart over the Panama Papers, they have both pledged to fight to convince the EU there is nothing illegal or immoral with Malta's tax system if they win office in elections on 3 June.

The secret to healthy Greek hearts,"Elderly villagers are well known for their good health and long lives Scientists have pinpointed one reason why people living in isolated villages in Greece may enjoy long and healthy lives. They found a new genetic variant, common among villagers, which appears to protect the heart by lowering levels of ""bad"" fats and cholesterol. Despite a diet rich in animal fat, the people of Mylopotamos in northern Crete do not suffer from cardiovascular disease. And they really love their cheese. The isolated villages of Zoniana and Anogia are high up in the mountains on the island of Crete. Few people move in or out of the villages and the inhabitants are known for living well into old age. Heart problems, heart attacks and strokes - all types of cardiovascular disease - are rare, and that's despite a diet which includes plenty of lamb and local Cretan cheese. There is a cheese festival held every year in the villages, by the way. Well, this kind of diet would normally be a recipe for lots of health complications. That's because eating foods that contain saturated fats raises the level of cholesterol in the blood, and high levels of low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in the blood increase the risk of heart disease and stroke. The villagers do get type 2 diabetes at the same rate as the general Greek population, but they don't seem to suffer from the usual consequences, such as diabetic kidney disease. The village of Zoniana is located high in the mountains of Crete That's exactly what researchers from theWellcome Trust Sanger Institute,externalwanted to know. Was there something in the villagers' genetic make-up that protected their hearts against disease? Their research, published inNature Communications,external, identified a new genetic variant which has heart-protecting qualities. It is associated with lower levels of ""bad"" natural fats and ""bad"" cholesterol - which are important for lowering the risk of cardiovascular disease. The variant appears to be virtually unique to the population of the two mountain villages. Out of thousands of Europeans who have undergone genome sequencing, only one other person in Italy possesses this variant, the researchers said. Grilled lamb is a traditional Greek dish To solve the puzzle, they sequenced the entire genome of 250 villagers. That means they took blood samples, extracted the DNA - the operating instructions for each one of us which determine how we look and who we are - and analysed a string of three billion letters which make up their human genome. Then they used the results to get a more detailed view of more than 3,000 villagers who had already been through genotyping (a shortcut to acquiring some genetic information). Cretan cheese is a major part of the diet because it is made locally This discovery isn't a reason to go out and eat your weight in animal fat and cheese. That wouldn't be recommended at all - because the rest of us don't possess this genetic variant. But scientists say they can use their discovery to work out which genetic variants play a role in causing complex diseases. This can give clues as to why some people develop heart disease and some don't. In this study, using this isolated population, they found a genetic variant no-one had seen before - and it's linked to the most common cause of death worldwide, cardiovascular disease. But there's still much to find out. Scientists can't tell why the variant is present - it could be to do with how the villagers live their lives, the environment they live in or it could have been passed down the generations. Very. Other research teams are looking at different isolated populations, such as the Amish in the United States, the Inuit in northern Greenland and the Orkney Islanders, in Scotland, to see what else they can discover about the secrets to staying healthy.

Our competitive edge is like giving a manufacturing company land on the cheap to encourage it to set up a factory in our country."" Ex-Finance Minister Tonio Fenech told the BBC it all boils down to tax competition. ""It's not Malta's problem that it has an attractive tax jurisdiction. It's the problem of other EU states that don't. Why should I increase my tax rates to please Germany or France? A lot of countries should look at the way their tax system has killed off business and led to unemployment."" Mr Fenech served for nine years as finance minister and oversaw the tax system when Malta joined the EU in 2004. He said the island had nothing to hide. Its corporate tax system was sanctioned by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and is in line with the EU's freedom of establishment. In 2014 EU pressure forced Malta to change its cash-for-passports scheme Mr Fenech insisted there was no fool-proof system anywhere to weed out questionable companies: ""There's VAT evasion, money laundering all over Europe. What I can assure you is we have a lot of stringent rules."" Malta's economic success has been overshadowed by corruption scandals that go to the core of the Labour government elected in 2013. The government has been under siege since the Panama Papers revealed details of secret companies in Panama. Those revelations have cast doubt on its ability to push through anti-money laundering legislation. Simon Busuttil, leader of the centre-right Nationalist Party, said the corruption that gripped the Muscat government was the main reason Malta was being subjected to closer scrutiny. The so-called Individual Investor Programme scheme, which enabled Malta to raise millions by selling its passports to rich foreigners, is at the centre of an inquiry, after Mr Busuttil claimed he had evidence to prove the prime minister's chief of staff was receiving kickbacks off the scheme. Malta tightens passport sale terms TheEuropean Parliament's ""Pana"" Committee,external, probing the Panama Papers, has summoned both Mr Muscat and his chief of staff for a hearing in June. Vice-chairperson Ana Gomes said: ""All these scandals relating to Panama are harming Malta's image and the EU's. We're very concerned about the systems, or the apparent lack of them, to prevent the island from being used for activities of money laundering and proceeds of crime."" Though Joseph Muscat and Simon Busuttil are worlds apart over the Panama Papers, they have both pledged to fight to convince the EU there is nothing illegal or immoral with Malta's tax system if they win office in elections on 3 June.

How Facebook's tentacles reach further than you think,"Vladan Joler says that all Facebook users are effectively working on behalf of the company Facebook's collection of data makes it one of the most influential organisations in the world. Share Lab wanted to look ""under the bonnet"" at the tech giant's algorithms and connections to better understand the social structure and power relations within the company. A couple of years ago, Vladan Joler and his brainy friends in Belgrade began investigating the inner workings of one of the world's most powerful corporations. The team, which includes experts in cyber-forensic analysis and data visualisation, had already looked into what he calls ""different forms of invisible infrastructures"" behind Serbia's internet service providers. But Mr Joler and his friends, now working under a project calledShare Lab,external, had their sights set on a bigger target. ""If Facebook were a country, it would be bigger than China,"" says Mr Joler, whose day job is as a professor at Serbia's Novi Sad University. He reels off the familiar, but still staggering, numbers: the barely teenage Silicon Valley firm stores some 300 petabytes of data, boasts almost two billion users, and raked in almost $28bn (Â£22bn) in revenues in 2016 alone. And yet, Mr Joler argues, we know next to nothing about what goes on under the bonnet - despite the fact that we, as users, are providing most of the fuel - for free. ""All of us, when we are uploading something, when we are tagging people, when we are commenting, we are basically working for Facebook,"" he says. Part of a huge flow chart mapping the influence and connections of Mark Zuckerberg The data our interactions provide feeds the complex algorithms that power the social media site, where, as Mr Joler puts it, our behaviour is transformed into a product. Trying to untangle that largely hidden process proved to be a mammoth task. ""We tried to map all the inputs, the fields in which we interact with Facebook, and the outcome,"" he says. ""We mapped likes, shares, search, update status, adding photos, friends, names, everything our devices are saying about us, all the permissions we are giving to Facebook via apps, such as phone status, wifi connection and the ability to record audio."" All of this research provided only a fraction of the full picture. So the team looked into Facebook's acquisitions, and scoured its myriad patent filings. The results were astonishing. Visually arresting flow charts that take hours to absorb fully, but which show how the data we give Facebook is used to calculate our ethnic affinity (Facebook's term), sexual orientation, political affiliation, social class, travel schedule and much more. Share Lab presents its information in minutely detailed tables and flow charts One map shows how everything - from the links we post on Facebook, to the pages we like, to our online behaviour in many other corners of cyber-space that are owned or interact with the company (Instagram, WhatsApp or sites that merely use your Facebook log-in) - could all be entering a giant algorithmic process. And that process allows Facebook to target users with terrifying accuracy, with the ability to determine whether they like Korean food, the length of their commute to work, or their baby's age. Another map details the permissions many of us willingly give Facebook via its many smartphone apps, including the ability to read all text messages, download files without permission, and access our precise location. Individually, these are powerful tools; combined they amount to a data collection engine that, Mr Joler argues, is ripe for exploitation. ""If you think just about cookies, just about mobile phone permissions, or just about the retention of metadata - each of those things, from the perspective of data analysis, are really intrusive."" How Cuba's growing internet is fuelling new businesses How DNA-testing kits are becoming big business 'You can tell by the way I use my walk...' Seeing the light: How India is embracing solar power Facebook has for years asserted that data privacy and the security of its operations are paramount. Facebook data, for example, cannot be used by developers to create surveillance tools and the firm says it complies with privacy protection laws in all countries. Thousands of new staff have been recruited to police its content. Mr Joler, though, while admitting that his research made him a little paranoid about the information that was being harvested, is more worried about the longer term. The data will remain in the hands of one company. Even if its current leaders are responsible and trustworthy, what about those in charge in 20 years? Analysts say Share Lab's work is valuable and impressive. ""It's probably the most comprehensive work mapping Facebook that I've ever seen,"" says Dr Julia Powles, an expert in technology law and policy at Cornell Tech. ""[The research] shows in cold and calculated terms how much we are giving away for the value of being able to communicate with your mates,"" she says. The scale of Facebook's reach can be stated in raw numbers - but Share Lab's maps make it visceral, in a way that drawing parallels cannot. ""We haven't really got appropriate historical analogies for the tech giants,"" explains Dr Powles. Their powers, she continues, extend ""far beyond"" the likes of the East India Company and monopolies of old, such as Standard Oil. And while many may consider the objectives of Mark Zuckerberg's empire to be rather benign, its outcomes are not always so. Facebook, argues Dr Powles, ""plays to our base psychological impulses"" by valuing popularity above all else. Experts say there are no historical analogies for the power that today's tech giants hold Not that she expects Share Lab's research to lead to a mass Facebook exodus, or a dramatic increase in the scrutiny of tech titans. ""What is most striking is the sense of resignation, the impotence of regulation, the lack of options, the public apathy,"" says Dr Powles. ""What an extraordinary situation for an entity that has power over information - there is no greater power really."" It is this extraordinary dominance that the Share Lab team set out to illustrate. But Mr Joler is quick to point out that even their grand maps cannot provide an accurate picture of the social media giant's capabilities. There is no guarantee, for example, that there are not many other algorithms at work that are still heavily guarded trade secrets. However, Mr Joler argues, ""it is still the one and only map that exists"" of one of the greatest forces shaping our world today.

How Stanley Matthews became a chief in Ghana,"Sir Stanley Matthews remains one of England's most famous footballers and was known as the Wizard of Dribble. But he was also arguably the first global icon, paving the way for superstars such as Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi. And it all began in Ghana, writes Scott Anthony. Football is the closest thing the planet has to a global popular culture. Wherever you go in the world, you'll find people kicking a ball around, watching matches in cafes, wearing replica shirts, and betting or playing football games on their phones. Yet the idea of a footballer as a global icon is a relatively recent phenomenon. The idea that a footballer could bring nations, classes and races together had to be invented. And it was an idea that was arguably invented in Africa. The story begins 60 years ago in Ghana when veteran English footballer Stanley Matthews strode out to play for Accra's Hearts of Oak against Kumasi Kotoko. Newly crowned as the first European Player of the Year, Matthews came to Ghana to play a series of exhibition matches to celebrate independence. Some Ghanaian players were star-struck playing alongside Matthews Matthews was installed as a ""soccerhene"" (soccer chief) ""Matthews' visit had a tremendous impact,"" says football writer Fiifi Anaman. ""When I spoke with some of the players about it, they said they couldn't believe Matthews came - it felt almost as if a god was walking among them."" The media had hyped up the visit, speculating how local hero Baba Yara, ""Ghana's King of Wingers"", would measure up against the superstar of European soccer. Matthews was mobbed on arrival and more than 80,000 spectators turned up to watch his first three matches against Kotoko, Sekondi Hasaacas and Kumasi Cornerstone. Shortly after his arrival, Matthews was presented with an ivory sword and installed as a ""soccerhene"" (soccer chief) in front of the press. Matthews' tour of the region led people to compare European and African styles of football. Newspapers emphasised that Matthews rarely ran, played corners short and almost never passed the ball off the ground. He avoided heading the ball. His visit prompted calls for Ghanaians to prioritise teamwork and alertness over effort and physicality. Ghana's first President, Kwame Nkrumah (r), was inspired by Matthews visit to use sport as a national unifier Even more importantly, Matthews arrived as Ghana's first President, Kwame Nkrumah, was trying to create an identity for Ghana - a country knitted together from numerous different ethnic groups under colonial rule. Removing the portrait of Elizabeth II from stamps and coins was  easy but it was more difficult to create new symbols capable of bringing the new nation together. In particular, President Nkrumah stressed the need for real-life examples. He wanted to emphasise the idea that you live your values rather than passively inherit them. Born 1 February 1915 in Stoke Played for Stoke City, Blackpool and England Did not smoke or consume alcohol and drank carrot juice every day Known as the Wizard of Dribble Won only major trophy in ""Matthews Final"", when Blackpool beat Bolton 4-3 in 1953 Won inaugural European Footballer of the Year award in 1956 On 15 May 1957, aged 42 and 103 days, became the oldest person to play for England 1965: First footballer to be knighted Never booked or sent off Died aged 85 in 2000 - his ashes are buried beneath the centre circle at Stoke's stadium The story of Sir Stanley Matthews,external The success of Matthews' tour helped convince Mr Nkrumah that sport could also play a significant role in the dissemination of African values. At this defining moment, Matthews was playing alongside the early greats of Ghanaian football such as James Adjaye, Chris Briandt and CK Gyamfi, who would go on to define that greatness. Ultimately, Ghana's president believed that sport was the perfect vehicle for the expression of pan-African idealism. ""By meeting together in the field of sport,"" Mr Nkrumah said, ""the youth of Africa will learn what our elders were prevented from learning - that all Africans are brothers with a common destiny."" In the years immediately after independence, Ghanaian football would not only serve as a vehicle for the development of what the president termed ""the African personality"" but be invested with the hope that it could help build a new kind of global solidarity. The England international, aged 42 when he arrived in Ghana, was a compelling if unusual figure. He had become a celebrity during World War Two when Allied authorities promoted the matches of touring All Star XIs to keep up morale in war zones. Here Matthews was a propagandist's dream. In addition to his amazing dribbling ability, he was never booked and lived an ascetic life. The contrast between Matthews' modesty and the icons of Fascist sport could not be clearer. Matthews also played and coached in Kenya Matthews' stringent fitness regime allowed him to play professional football until the age of 50 After Matthews' Blackpool beat Bolton in the 1953 FA Cup final, popularly known as ""the Matthews final"", his fame was propelled worldwide through newsreels and television. Affection for ""Our Stan"" grew as his stringent fitness regime allowed him to play professional football until the age of 50. During his visit, Ghanaian newspapers labelled him ""the Saint of Soccer"" as he visited schools and hospitals. Independent Ghana required its own brand of heroic gentlemen. Approachable but exceptional, the example of the ""soccerhene"" encouraged Ghana's government to make sport and sports stars central to their project. As independence spread throughout the African continent, Mr Nkrumah's use of sport for nation-building would be widely imitated. Later in the 1960s, it would become fashionable for icons of global sport, from Pele to Muhammad Ali, to make pilgrimages to newly independent African states. Immediately after Matthews' visit, the Englishman George Ainsley was appointed manager of the national team, the ""Black Stars"". Ghana became the first African nation to tour Eastern Europe and the first sub-Saharan African nation to qualify for the Olympic Games. In 1963 CK Gyamfi would coach Ghana to victory in the African Cup of Nations, a trophy they retained in 1965. Mr Nkrumah also pushed Fifa to guarantee a spot for an African side at the World Cup, which was introduced afterAfrican nations boycotted the 1966 World Cup. Matthews himself would become a regular visitor to Africa, playing and coaching in countries such as Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa. Archbishop Desmond Tutu said Matthews' visit to Soweto had dented the armoury of apartheid South Africa In later life he favourably contrasted the collective spirit of African football, especially in Soweto, with the economic bigotry he saw taking over the game in the UK. ""Going into the townships at a time when racial discrimination was at its most intense [was] something that had all kinds of ramifications,"" remembered Archbishop Desmond Tutu. ""It made a dent in the apartheid armoury."" In Ghana, President Nkrumah's politicisation of football would prove a double-edged sword, as the regime's centralising and authoritarian tendencies eventually brought the league into disrepute and fanned regional factionalism. Internationally, however, African governmental activism broke the European and South American duopoly over football and in the process the idea that football was an uncontainable and universalising global force was born.

How I took my family on the run for 19 years,"Five years ago a woman walked into a police station in Ozark, Missouri, and claimed her father-in-law was a British fugitive. It was the end of the road for Eddie Maher, who had been on the run - with wife and children in tow - for 19 years. How did one of the UK's most wanted men evade capture for so long? In January 1993, Securicor driver Eddie Maher sped away from Lloyds Bank in Felixstowe in a van containing Â£1.2m ($1.6m). Then he disappeared. Police pursued leads from Cyprus to the Caribbean, but found no trace of Maher - or the money - despite offering a Â£100,000 reward. ""You can live off the grid in plain sight if you're not silly,"" says Maher, now 61. ""Most people get caught because they are ridiculously extravagant."" He succeeded for nearly two decades, choosing the US because he thought it would be the easiest place to lie low. ""The United States is a huge country and everyone speaks the same language, so you don't stand out,"" he says. ""Travelling was more comfortable back then. It was pre-9/11 and there weren't as many checks."" Maher in his Securicor uniform The fireman-turned-security-van-driver flew business class from Heathrow to Dallas, a few weeks after the heist, carrying a suitcase with banknotes wrapped in towels and a fake passport in the name of Stephen King. Maher estimates he had around Â£125,000 ($160,000), the cut he was given by a shadowy gang that he says pressurised him into committing the crime. (Police have always rejected the claim that he was acting under duress.) He had sent his partner, Debbie Brett, on holiday to Boston a few weeks earlier with their toddler, Lee. He only explained to her they were on the run when they met at a pre-arranged spot in Dallas airport, he says. ""She wasn't over the moon when I told her but we're a couple. She's my best friend,"" he says. ""Plus I convinced her she could contact her family after a while."" In fact, Maher knew they couldn't risk contacting loved ones in the UK. He only made one phone call home during his 19 years away - a call to his sick mother, one year after he vanished. ""It was difficult not seeing family, especially for Debbie. Every now and then I'd get a twinge of regret but I made the decision that we were better off over there,"" Maher says. Eddie with his son, Lee, shortly before they went on the run After spending a few weeks assessing their options, Maher and Brett settled with their son in Woodland Park, a small town in Colorado. It was far from the tourist trail so the risk of being recognised was low, and as it was growing quickly, new faces were accepted without too many questions being asked. They paid cash for a four-bedroom house and soon bedded into the community. Proof of address was sufficient to get Lee into nursery and later into elementary school. They introduced themselves as Stephen and Sarah King. According to their cover story, Stephen was a photocopier salesman from Essex who had sold his business and was deciding what to do next. They had a well-rehearsed line when people asked about family and friends in the UK. ""We'd say, 'They've already been over and are welcome to visit any time,'"" Maher says. ""It never got easier telling those stories. I hated lying every day but we had no choice."" Eddie Maher's first house in Woodland Park, Colorado The couple went on hunting and fishing trips with the neighbours, Brett volunteered at the nursery and Maher joined the mountain search and rescue team. He also made friends with people on the local airfield and was given flying lessons in exchange for driving the fuel truck. He later bought his own plane, a Piper Warrior, which he rented back to the flying school. ""I've seen those reality shows like Hunted and I find them quite laughable,"" Maher says. ""Hiding in plain sight is easier."" Maher enjoyed life in Colorado but lived in constant fear of capture. Although his moments of paranoia and anxiety became less frequent over time they never completely went away. In 1994 Maher and Brett got married under their fake names in Las Vegas, acquiring a wedding certificate in the process - another useful document that would help to confirm their fake identities. Debbie and Eddie had a wedding ceremony at a traditional chapel in Las Vegas Maher had already taken driving lessons, even though he had driven for decades, to get a licence in the name of Stephen King. He had used that to open a bank account. In addition, he had forged a California birth certificate for Lee, and applied for a social security card for him so that he could work when he was older. However, he couldn't get Lee a passport. For that he needed a genuine birth certificate, one that could be traced to a birth record in a state ledger. Another document Maher couldn't forge was a green card, and without one neither he nor Brett could work. ""I tried to find jobs where you didn't need ID, like illegal immigrants do. But there isn't much unless you want to go orange-picking in California,"" Maher says. As their funds dwindled, Maher made some money playing blackjack in Las Vegas. The family also moved to a smaller home and sold their plane - and it was when the buyer only paid a quarter of what he had promised that Maher realised it was time to leave. Maher spent $16,000 on a Piper Warrior plane but sold it for a fraction of the price ""When I asked for the money, he said, 'I think there's something shady about you. Maybe I'll call the cops,'"" Maher says. The couple moved hastily to Concord, New Hampshire. At the same time, Maher decided to give up being Stephen King, and hatched a risky plan to assume a different identity. ""My brother, Michael, had married an American years before but had since moved to the UK. I knew he had a legitimate green card and I knew all his details,"" he says. So Maher wrote to the authorities as Michael, claiming he had lost his green card. Then he waited anxiously. But no-one raised the alarm and before long he was sent a replacement in the post. Maher then applied for a commercial driver's licence in his brother's name and started work as a lorry driver. With a steady income now, Maher and Brett settled in to life in Concord. Maher started coaching Little League baseball and in 1997 the couple had another son, Mark. They became friendly with a couple who had a weekend home on a nearby lake, and would often visit. A year later Maher got a job installing Nielsen TV systems, which are used to calculate ratings for TV shows. He only needed one reference from the UK, which he forged. The family stayed in New Hampshire for five years. Then came the 9/11 attacks, and neighbours seemed to become more curious about them. ""It got to the point where our friends would joke, 'You must be in the witness protection programme.' I thought that was a sign we'd probably been there too long,"" Maher says. He successfully applied for a promotion at Nielsen and the family relocated to Dunedin in Florida. Maher was now in tech support and Brett worked cash-in-hand for a house-cleaning business. They rented a home by the beach and Maher took up golf. They would only visit Disney World off-season, to reduce the risk of meeting British tourists. After a few more years, and a few more house moves, Maher and Brett decided to settle down permanently.  In 2008 they moved to the small town of Ozark in Missouri, where Maher found work as a broadband technician, while Brett got another cash-in-hand job, this time with a property-letting agency. Despite this, they began running up credit card bills, and Maher ended up declaring bankruptcy in 2010. But even this didn't lead to his exposure. His weak spot turned out to be his own son, Lee. As a teenager, Lee had begun asking questions about his English relatives and Maher says he began to rebel when he didn't get a straight answer - embarking on a series of short-term relationships, fathering a number of children and regularly getting into trouble. ""My sons had a good upbringing. I taught them to be law-abiding citizens. But when Lee got to the age of being headstrong and stupid that put pressure on us,"" Maher says. ""He was a problem and in the end that's the problem that brought everything to a head."" Lee Maher met and married Jessica Butler but they soon started quarrelling. According to Eddie, a drunken Lee once told Jessica he thought his father was a fugitive. He believes she then searched for his surname online and found old news reports of the Securicor heist, along with the promise of a reward. Eddie and Debbie at a Nielsen Media Research Service Awards On 6 February 2012 she walked into Ozark police station and said she knew the whereabouts of the British fugitive, ""Fast Eddie"" Maher. Maher was then told by a police officer that the authorities knew who he was, and the FBI noted his furious response. ""Maher told his son they would have to leave again and threatened to kill the person who tipped off police about his identity,"" reported federal agent Jeffrey Atwood. But Maher decided not to run. Instead he came clean to his sons. ""My real name is Eddie,"" he said. ""And your mum isn't Sarah. She's Debbie."" In July 2012 he was extradited to the UK. Eight months later he was sentenced to five years for theft, but was released in January 2015. ""I don't grumble, I don't say I didn't do the crime. I did my time for it,"" Maher says. He is philosophical about spending 19 years looking over his shoulder. ""I don't regret my life in America. My second son was born there and if I hadn't gone through this he may never have been born. It's been my life and we've adapted,"" he says. He would like to return to America, this time as Eddie Maher, but his criminal conviction means that this is impossible. He doesn't want to stay in the UK though, and fancies a place in the sun - Spain perhaps, or Cyprus. ""We'll keep our heads down,"" he says, ""and enjoy a bit of a retirement.""
