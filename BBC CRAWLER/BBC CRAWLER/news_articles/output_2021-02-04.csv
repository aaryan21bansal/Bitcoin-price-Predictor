Youngest set for school return this month in WalesMinisters are expected to confirm three to seven-year-olds will return to class after half-term.Wales,"All schools and colleges in Wales were told to move to online learning at the start of this term Children aged three to seven will return to school after the February half-term, the Welsh Government is expected to confirm on Friday. Most pupils have been learning from home after a surge in Covid cases led to a Welsh lockdown. The decision would mean the foundation phase of primary schools returning from 22 February. But the head of one teaching union said they would not support the move without assurances about teacher safety. Education Minister Kirsty Williams is expected to make the announcement at a lunchtime press conference on Friday. It follows a fall in the number of infections, and negotiations with teaching trade unions, who have called for teachers to be in the priority list for vaccinations. The Welsh Government had been under pressure to set out plans for a return to face-to-face teaching after weeks of lockdown. School return 'unlikely' for all in February Schools return plan 'needs more local Covid work' 'Grave consequences' in closing Wales' schools It comes as other parts of the UK consider when children can return to face-to-face teaching. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said 8 March was the earliest date schools in England could reopen and that""depends on lots of things going right"". In Northern Irelandpupils will not return to school until 8 Marchat the earliest whileScotland's youngest pupils are likely to return to the classroom full time from 22 Februaryas schools start a phased reopening. The Covid case rate in Wales is currently the lowest of the UK nations. It now stands at 126 per 100,000 people over seven days - a fall from about 700 before Christmas. Earlier, teachers' union NASUWT said a joint group of unions had given the Welsh Government a list of ""mitigations"" they wanted to see put in place. They include strict social distancing, medical grade masks for teachers in the foundation phase and a ""further consideration of a flexible and phased return"". Neil Butler, its national officer in Wales, said on Friday the union would not support the return to school unless a number of those mitigations were taken on board. He told BBC Radio Wales: ""We've got no indication of what's going to be changed in the operational guidance which fits into those mitigations that we want to see. ""If the operational guidance has taken nothing on board in terms of the joint union mitigation list then we're not going to be able to support this return on the 22nd."" Ucac general secretary Dilwyn Roberts-Young said there needed to be ""local flexibility to stagger the return of foundation phase children"". ""We'll also need clear guidelines about social distancing, the use of face-coverings, sufficient ventilation, and which staff are exempt from return and can continue to work from home. ""Above all, school staff need to hear that they figure in the government's priority list for vaccination, particularly those in the foundation phase where it is almost impossible to ensure social distancing."" Young children are expected to return to school after half-term All schools and colleges in Wales were toldto move to online learning before the start of this term in an effort to ""suppress the virus"", Ms Williams said at the start of January. Some schools had been due to openin the new year butunions called for the return to be delayedamid concerns about a variant of coronavirus blamed for a rise in cases before Christmas. Schools and colleges have remained open for children of critical workers and vulnerable pupils, as well as for children who needed to complete essential exams or assessments. Victoria Rosser said she had ""mixed emotions"" about the changes Victoria Rosser, a mother of four from Cwmbran, is on the shielding list and is yet to receive her first dose of the Covid vaccine. She said she wants to be able to make the decision over whether it is safe for her children to return to the classroom. ""I have mixed emotions towards the decision being announced today,"" she said. ""I do not feel it's safe for parents and guardians, who've been placed on the shielding list like me, to send their children until phase one of the priority list are post-three weeks of receiving their vaccine. ""Parents are being crippled with having to balance their children's education, work and running a home. This is not home schooling, it's trying to accommodate three jobs at the same time, which is impossible in the long-term."" Meanwhile, Chris Lawrence, who lives in Cardiff and has three children, said it was ""really important"" children get back to school as soon as possible. He said: ""From my perspective what we've been doing in terms of shutting schools, we were always told it would be the last resort, but at the moment it's been adopted as the thing that we do. If your kids are at home then pretty much all parents have to be at home as well."" Samantha Pearce from Blaenau Gwent, who's daughter Hazel is 10, said she didn't want to see year groups rushed back. But she added: ""The prolonged closure of the schools is having a huge detrimental effect. Schools for us here in Blaenau Gwent have been already been closed for two months now - and children are bored an unengaged with the work."" Rachel Antoniazzi, who is deputy head at Thornhill Primary School in Cardiff, said getting children back into school would be a ""relief"" for parents and teachers, but there were also some concerns for staff. She said: ""I do really honestly believe that the type of learning that foundation phase children are expected to do doesn't work very well from home. It puts a lot of pressure on parents, it's not conducive to the way foundation phase learners are expected to learn."" Ms Antoniazzi's school has been operating as a hub for children of key workers during the lockdown, and will continue to do so for the children in the upper years of the school, alongside reopening for the youngest pupils. ""In an ideal world we would love to welcome the whole school back but we have to be really careful,"" she said. ""I think the biggest fear, and the government have to be really clear on this, is that it's a necessity to reopen schools, but it doesn't mean we're back to normal. ""It's better than being at home but I do want parents to get the message that doesn't mean you can go to playdates."" Plaid Cymru's education spokeswoman SiÃ¢n Gwenllian called for school staff and other key workers to be moved to the top of the list in each vaccination priority group. ""Parents, learners and staff need reassurance that the school environment is safe, and there are certainly things that can be done to give them confidence, such as more extensive use of ventilation, school workers moved to the top of their vaccine priority group, and schools must be given all options to enable adequate social distancing in classrooms. ""With a year of hindsight, it pains me to think how much more face-to-face education our children and young people could have had, if Welsh Government had used all the tools in their gift earlier."" Suzy Davies of the Welsh Conservatives questioned the staggered approach Education spokeswoman for the Welsh Conservatives Suzy Davies welcomed the return but questioned the staggered approach. She added: ""It's been a tough period for children, parents and teachers, and it makes sense for primaries to go back to catch up with each other; these youngest pupils have lost most in terms of learning and vital early-years socialisation. ""We need a can-do, will-do approach from ministers as teachers on the front line want to return to the classroom so long as it's safe to do so. ""They must now put plans in place for those critical secondary years, and to get in the maximum amount of learning to prepare our older learners for college and university with an even more dynamic, innovative, flexible and ultimately safe approach to secondary schools."" The first minister said the youngest pupils would be back in school if virus rates carried on falling. A week later, the indicators are going in the right direction, suggesting three to seven-year-olds will be back in classes on or soon after 22 February. But this process feels different to the return after the summer or after the first lockdown. The virus variants have added another layer of anxiety, and the approach is even more cautious. Older primary pupils may have to learn from home for a while longer, and a return for secondary and college pupils, apart from those doing practical qualifications, still seems to be some way off.

Law change to allow maternity leave for minister,"The government is to update the law so that the attorney general can take six months' maternity leave. Suella Braverman, the government's chief law officer, announced in November she was expecting her second child ""early next year"". She would be one of the most senior government ministers to give birth in office. Under current laws, she would have to resign if she wanted to take time off following the birth. The government has announced a new law to formalise the process for ministerial maternity leave, which until now has been at the discretion of the prime minister. TheMinisterial and other Maternity Allowances Bill,externalwill allow cabinet ministers to receive up to six months' leave on full pay. At the moment, legislation from the 1970s means the prime minister does not normally have the flexibility to pay a cabinet minister maternity leave alongside paying a salary to their temporary replacement. New mothers 'need better job protection' 'Locum MP' to cover Stella Creasy maternity The bill would allow Ms Braverman and other cabinet ministers to take six months' leave on full pay - similar to more junior government roles and the civil service. Several female politicians serving as junior ministers have taken maternity leave in the past, including Conservative MPs Tracey Crouch and Kemi Badenoch. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said his party would back the bill, adding the change ""should have been brought in a long time ago"". The party's shadow cabinet office minister, Rachel Reeves, said the measures were a ""small but significant step forward"" but the government needed to go further and make provision for paternity, adoption and shared parental leave. Introducing the new measuresin a written statement,,externalthe prime minister said: ""The choice between taking leave to recover from childbirth and care for a new-born child or resigning from office is not acceptable in modern times."" Boris Johnson acknowledged that provisions needed to be made for leave for adoption, sickness and other circumstances. Ministers aren't subject to normal employee rights because they're appointed, and fired, by the prime minister. Many will be surprised to learn that Suella Braverman will become the first cabinet minister to take paid maternity leave. It's a generous scheme which will grant six months of full pay - under current rules, she would have had to resign or be demoted to qualify. The bill is being rushed through Parliament because she's due to give birth soon, but Labour wants to revisit the issue later to include paternity leave. The years of muddling through on an informal basis will end next Thursday. Ms Braverman, the Conservative MP for Fareham, became the second-ever woman to be appointed attorney general for England and Wales in February 2020. She had previously served as a junior Brexit minister under Theresa May, beforeresigning in November 2018in protest at the former PM's Brexit plans. She went on to take maternity leave whilst serving as a backbench MP after the birth of her first child in July 2019, with a ""proxy MP"" taking part in parliamentary debates and votes on her behalf. Labour's Tulip Siddiq delayed a caesarean section to take part in a vote All MPs are paid in full while on maternity, paternity or adoption leave. But not all their duties in Parliament are covered during their absence: Conservative MP Tracey Crouch,externalwas the first Conservative minister to take maternity leave in 2016.  She said she had been unsure about accepting the job of sports minister because she wanted to start family Chloe Smithinterrupted her maternity leave in 2017 to take part in a vote - becoming the first Conservative MP to bring their baby in to the Commons chamber In 2019, Labour MPTulip Siddiqwent against the advice of her doctors and delayed a planned caesarean section so she could take part in a crucial Brexit vote Labour'sStella Creasywas given permission to appoint a ""locum MP"" to cover her maternity leave in 2019 Father-of-three Conservative MPBim Afolami,externalwas the first dad able to vote by proxy when he took paternity leave Responding to the change, Ms Creasy said: ""In no other workplace would guaranteed paid maternity leave and cover be only the preserve of the management. ""The introduction of cover for ministers is long overdue, and this legislation reveals the lie I was told when I asked for maternity cover that MPs employment status made it impossible."" Ms Creasy added: ""What message does it send to the thousands of pregnant women facing redundancy and job insecurity in the pandemic or any of those considering entering public life at any level, if parliament treats maternity leave as a bonus like a company car to be given only to those at the top?"" Women are entitled to up to 52 weeks' maternity leave They must take at least two weeks' leave after the baby is born (or four weeks if they work in a factory) They are eligible to be paid for six weeks at 90% of their average weekly earnings and 33 weeks at Â£151 per week or 90% of their average weekly earnings (if lower) Fathers can take two weeks' statutory paternity leave at up to Â£151 a week Some couples are also entitled to shared parental leave of up to 50 weeks and 37 weeks of pay Should parental leave be extended due to coronavirus?

Ending benefit lifeline 'risks health of millions',"""Obviously we will find a way to survive, because we have to, but it's a lot lot harder,"" said single mum, Rebecca Failing to extend a Â£20 lockdown benefit boost will harm the health of millions of people for decades, leading health organisations have told Prime Minister Boris Johnson in a letter. Introduced last year, the Â£20-a-week uplift is due to end in April. Claimants say it has been a lifeline and dread losing it. Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey has hinted the government could be moving closer to extending the rise but says there is no decision yet. Now, groups representing doctors, nurses and social workers,say health inequalities laid bare by Covid will worsen if the uplift to universal credit is scrapped.,external MPs urge Johnson to keep Â£20 benefit 'lifeline' Benefit increase only 'temporary', says Raab Their comments echo those of campaigners and claimants - such as single mother Rebecca, from the east of England, who told BBC News withdrawing the extra cash would be ""cruel"". Rebecca, who asked the BBC not to use her full name, has an eight-year-old daughter and relies on universal credit to supplement her earnings from working 14 hours a week for a charity. She has been receiving the benefit for two years, the first of which, before the extra payment was introduced, she describes as ""brutal"". And by October 2019, ""we had no money for food"". ""I put a post on Facebook, asking where I could go safely with a kid for free food,"" she said. In the end, it was gifts from friends and food parcels from a local church that saw them through. The introduction of the Â£20 boost had provided a buffer, said Rebecca. ""At least I had something coming in,"" she said. ""The Â£20 is mostly food for her - I eat whatever I can. ""Obviously we will find a way to survive, because we have to, but it's a lot lot harder."" The letter calls on the prime minister to make the temporary increase to universal credit and working tax credit permanent from April and provide the same uplift to other key benefits. ""As organisations working across health and care, we see the irrefutable evidence that poverty has significant negative impacts on individuals, their families and society more widely,"" it says. The signatories include: the Royal College of Nursing the Royal College of General Practitioners the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health the Royal College of Psychiatrists the British Association of Social Workers the British Psychological Society mental-health charity Mind The letter calls the extra Â£20 ""an investment in our nation's health, ensuring many of those on the lowest incomes have access to essentials like food or heating"". ""In a year marked by worry and uncertainty, the uplift has been a preventative lifeline keeping many afloat, protecting them from financial instability, debt and worsening mental health,"" it says. And if it is discontinued, ""overnight 6.2 million families will face a Â£1,040 cut to their incomes"". ""We cannot plan for the UK's economic recovery only to face another escalating health crisis for those on the lowest incomes,"" the letter says. On Wednesday, Ms Coffey told MPs: ""We have the effects of this pandemic that are ongoing. ""And we recognise the need to continue to support people."" She rejected the idea the extra Â£20 ""reduces work incentives"", telling the Work and Pensions Committee this ""steady stream of money would be more beneficial to claimants"" than an alternative option of a one-off payment. Families 'face period of destitution' during Covid Ministers urged to extend lockdown benefit 'boost' The Â£20 boost, which costs about Â£6bn, came after years of cuts to benefits. Changes since the Conservatives came to power in 2010, initially in coalition, mean spending on working-age benefits  is about Â£32bn lower this year than it would have been, the Institute for Fiscal Studies has calculated. And even with the extra Â£20, a single person with no children who loses their job in the UK this year will receive just 17% of average earnings in benefit payments, the lowest figure among high-income economies. The cuts to welfare have also been blamed by campaigners and charities for the increase in child poverty since 2010. Another think tank, the Resolution Foundation, has calculated even if the Â£20 boost is made permanent, child poverty will continue to rise. And by 2024, one third of children will be living in poverty. Rebecca said she knew how to budget but still struggled to make ends meet, even with the extra Â£20 a week. Without it, ""every day is stress because you don't know how you're going to make it for the next month"". ""You're always living on your toes,"" she said. ""And you're always having to budget minute by minute and budget to the very penny."" ""When already you are scraping for money, Â£20 is masses."" A government spokesman said: ""We are committed to supporting the lowest-paid families through the pandemic and beyond to ensure that nobody is left behind."" He said support had been targeted at those most in need, including ""raising the living wage, spending hundreds of billions to safeguard jobs, boosting welfare support by billions and introducing the Â£170m Covid Winter Grant Scheme"".

UK economy 'to rebound strongly thanks to vaccine',"The UK's rapid Covid-19 vaccination programme will help the economy bounce back strongly this year, according to the Bank of England. The economy is expected to shrink 4.2% in the first three months of 2021, amid tighter lockdown restrictions to slow the spread of the virus. But policymakers expect a rebound this spring as consumer confidence returns. The Bank also told High Street lenders to prepare for negative interest rates, even as it ruled out an imminent move. What are negative interest rates? The UK economy is expected to ""recover rapidly"" in 2021, with a successful vaccination programme supporting a ""material recovery in household spending"". Andrew Bailey, the governor of the Bank of England, described the vaccine rollout as ""excellent news"" that would speed up a return to normal life. ""We do think that that is going to support a sustained recovery throughout the rest of the year,"" he said. What is the Budget and when will it happen? Firms 'in the dark' over post lockdown reopening How high could the unemployment rate go? Its latest Monetary Policy Report,externalsaid the positive vaccine news had driven an increase in UK holiday bookings later this year, although overseas bookings remained muted. While government support schemes are expected to limit any immediate increase in unemployment, the jobless rate is still projected to rise to 7.8% later this year as the furlough scheme winds down. The most recent unemployment rate -for September to November - was 5.0%, However, policymakers said the outlook for the economy remained ""unusually uncertain"". The Bank said the rebound in economic activity would depend on controlling any new strains of the virus, as well as households' willingness to spend. It said most people now expect ""life to return to normal"" within a year. But some voluntary social distancing was likely to persist, as it has done in economies where restrictions have already been eased substantially. In New Zealand, for example, spending on restaurants and hotels has still not recovered to pre-pandemic levels. The Bank said: ""The Covid vaccination programme would be expected to lead to an easing of social distancing restrictions, reduced economic uncertainty and higher activity, although the timing of those effects is hard to predict."" Millions of workers remain on thegovernment's furlough scheme, while redundancies increased sharply at the end of last year. However, many high earners working from home have saved more during the pandemic. The Bank said Â£125bn more was squirrelled away in UK savings accounts last year. The Bank said concerns about using public transport has pushed up demand for second-hand cars. ""That figure is likely to rise substantially further over the first half of 2021,"" the Bank said. Policymakers believe retired households, which have received vaccines sooner, will start spending first. Greater job security is also expected to lead to higher spending. However, the Bank noted that 70% of the people it surveyed planned to keep their extra money in savings instead of spending it. Sales of new cars are also expected to remain subdued, though concerns about using public transport have pushed up sales of second-hand vehicles. The Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) held interest rates at a record low of 0.1% on Thursday. Following a review, it has also asked High Street banks to get ready for the possibility that they could fall below zero in the future. The term ""interest rates"" is often used interchangeably with the Bank of England base rate. Described as the ""single most important interest rate in the UK"", the base rate determines how much interest the Bank of England pays to financial institutions that hold money with it, and what it charges them to borrow. High Street banks also use it to determine how much interest they pay to savers, as well as what they charge people who take out a loan or mortgage. The Bank of England usually lowers interest rates when it wants people to spend more and save less. In theory, taking interest rates below zero should have the same effect. But in practice, it's a bit more complicated. After all, why would anyone pay to stash money in a savings account or lend someone money, when they can keep the cash at home for free? The Bank stressed that commercial lenders needed at least six months to prepare and this did not mean that negative rates were ""imminent, or indeed in prospect at any time"". Mr Bailey added: ""My message to the markets is you really should not try to read the future behaviour of the MPC from these decisions and these actions we're taking on the toolbox. ""Nobody should take any signal from this."" Could you have to pay your bank to save money? Bank of England questions banks over negative rates The Bank of England is not just counting jobs and prices, but vaccinations too. On this basis, despite the current three months seeing a lockdown-inflicted fall in the economy, policymakers are more confident about the timing of recovery, in the middle of this year. Indeed, that recovery will be mathematically sharper than previously predicted, because of the further drop right now. As the Bank concludes in its forecast ""GDP picks up strongly"" as restrictions are assumed to ease between April and September. In terms of its decisions, that means the Bank has held fire, leaving interest rates at historic lows. Not one of the nine panel members deciding rates voted for the much-hyped ""negative rates"" seen in Europe. Commercial banks will be asked to prepare in the next months, so the lever is an option, but the Bank of England was at pains to say this was not a signal of intentions. The Bank was also clear that the post-Brexit trading rules will hit the economy, and that there are new ""barriers"" likely to lower trade between the UK and EU, some which are yet to emerge. This goes beyond the government's repeated claims that such changes are ""teething problems"". The big message, though, is a more confident assertion that the economy, as well as the people, will be inoculated by the summer.

Biden ends support for Yemen war in policy reset,"Millions in Yemen are in need of food, medicine or shelter after more than six years of war The US is to end its support for offensive operations by its allies in Yemen, which has been devastated by a six-year war in which more than 110,000 people are believed to have died. ""The war in Yemen must end,"" President Joe Biden said in his first major foreign policy speech. Under Mr Biden's two predecessors, the US backed a coalition led by Saudi Arabia against Houthi rebels in Yemen. The conflict has left millions of Yemenis on the brink of starvation. Fighting began in 2014 between a weak Yemeni government and the Houthi rebel movement. It escalated a year later, when Saudi Arabia and eight other Arab states - backed by the US, the UK and France - began air strikes against the Houthis. Biden vows US 'reset' in foreign policy speech Mr Biden announced other changes to US foreign policy, such as a significant increase in the number of refugees accepted by the US. His speech marks a sharp break with the policies of former President Donald Trump, who left office last month. On Russia, for instance, the new US leader said: ""I made it clear to President [Vladimir] Putin, in a manner very different from my predecessor, that the days of the United States rolling over in the face of Russia's aggressive actionsâ¦ are over."" The comments drew fierce criticism from the Kremlin. ""This is very aggressive, unconstructive rhetoric, to our regret,"" Mr Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Friday. The US has been backing the Yemeni government and its Saudi-led allies in their war against the Houthis. As a result of Thursday's announcement, the US will stop supporting offensive operations, including the sale of precision-guided munitions to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). This will not affect operations against al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. The Biden administration had already put a temporary halt on arms sales to Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Can Biden get the Saudis to change course? Why is there a war in Yemen? The rise of Yemen's Houthi rebels Mr Biden isexpected to name his new Yemen envoy as Tim Lenderking, an experienced diplomat and Middle East specialist,external. This marks a change of tack from Mr Trump's administration, which increased support for the Saudi-led coalition. Last month Mr Trump's Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, announced thatthe Houthis were being designated a ""terrorist organisation"". He said the aim was to hold the Houthis accountable for cross-border attacks and deter ""malign activity"" by their backer Iran. Aid organisations criticised the move, warning that it could prevent them from operating in areas where millions are in urgent need of food aid. Last week, the Biden administration said it would exempt certain transactions involving the Houthis from sanctions. That exemption will expire on 26 February. The United Nations says Yemen is the world's worst humanitarian crisis, with 80% of the population in need of aid or protection. This video can not be played (November 2020) Three Yemeni teens share how their lives have changed These announcements confirm President Biden's pledge to end Yemen's destructive war. Halting US support to the Saudi-led coalition's offensive operations won't close this bloody chapter, but it sends a strong signal to leaders in Riyadh and Abu Dhabi - they've also been trying to find ways to extricate themselves from this quagmire. Achieving peace among Yemen's bitter enemies will be a monumental challenge. Tim Lenderking is set to be the first US envoy for Yemen since this war was unleashed nearly six years ago. He's worked on this file for years and is known to everyone who matters. Western diplomats, as well as Yemenis, have welcomed this new US engagement. In 2015, President Obama gave a green light to the Saudi-led campaign, partly to ease the Kingdom's anger over the Iran nuclear deal. Now new US envoys on Yemen, and Iran, are tasked with ending this war, and the regional rivalries which still fuel it. The US will raise the cap onrefugee admissionsfrom 15,000 to 125,000 for the fiscal year. Thewithdrawal of US troopsfrom Germany will be frozen and forces will remain at their current level of about 36,000. Under Mr Trump, the US was going to reduce its presence by 12,000, with about 5,600 to be deployed elsewhere in Europe. Mr Biden called onMyanmar's military rulers to release civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi and restore democracy. He also promised to engage diplomatically withRussiabut to be tougher on Moscow than Mr Trump, saying the US would not ""roll over"".

Teachers sent Covid jab booking link for NHS staff,"Teachers are not among those prioritised for the Covid vaccine in England, unless they also meet age or health-related criteria Hundreds of teachers in London have been able to book Covid vaccine slots despite not being in the top priority groups, after they were forwarded messages intended for NHS workers. A booking link and passcode meant for staff at Barts Health NHS Trust were circulated via Whatsapp to staff at local schools, teachers told the BBC. Some have received a jab as a result. The trust said it was investigating and will take steps to improve the security of its booking system. The government toldthe BBC's Newscast podcastin a statement it was ""absolutely critical that vaccines are offered in the priority order"". Teachers at schools in north and east London - including in Hackney, Camden and Barnet - said the messages had been sent via school management and were spreading in WhatsApp groups with dozens of members. When will I get a Covid vaccine? Labour stands by teacher vaccinations policy Newscast found that it was still possible to book an appointment using the information in the messages on Thursday evening. One teacher who booked an appointment, and who asked to remain anonymous, said it was ""not a case of trying to jump the queue"". ""When the appointment was confirmed I was surprised, thinking that it would have been refused if teachers were not actually entitled to these vaccines,"" they said. ""The conflicting and changing guidance from the government made me feel like it was possible that this was a genuine offer for teachers that had just not been passed on."" They added: ""Obviously, teachers will only have the vaccine when it is made available to us."" A message intended for NHS staff was circulated on teachers' WhatsApp groups Another teacher said they, too, were surprised to find they could book an appointment. ""I thought this must be a local ad hoc way of avoiding wasting vaccines that hadn't been taken up. But I did some research and concluded this wasn't right,"" the teacher said. ""I think the problem is that people think this is genuine and don't think it's a loophole, but a local policy. It's not malicious or about queue-jumping."" Barts Health NHS Trust confirmed that a booking link for its own employees was forwarded to local school staff and that this should not have happened. It said it was investigating the source of the messages and measures were being put in place to make the booking system more secure. It said anyone attending an appointment who is ineligible to do so would be turned away and that members of the public should not book an appointment until they have been contacted directly by the NHS. In a statement, the trust said that it was vaccinating frontline staff and their relatives - where relevant - in line with national guidance. ""To avoid waste, any unfilled vaccination slots are offered to other staff working within our hospitals,"" it said. It comes after reports that Rochdale Borough Council in Greater Manchester wrote to head teachers accusing some school staff of trying to get jabs via an ""inappropriately shared"" email. Vaccination centres in Rochdale will now require people to show proof of employment in order to prevent people from being able to circumnavigate the system. The leader of Manchester City Council, Sir Richard Leese, warned that anyone who had received a vaccine under those circumstances would be investigated and appropriate action taken to ensure that vaccines are given to those in greatest need. During a press conference on Wednesday, Sir Richard said some people were ""fiddling the system, using other people's links to get access"". ""People should not go before they are called to go as you are taking a slot away from someone in greater need,"" he said. ""If people are gaming the system, if they are using other people's names, and they are not in priority groups, they are denying somebody at greater risk a vaccine and given the primary objective of this first half of the first phase is to save lives and take the pressure off our hospitals, they are also undermining our efforts to do that."" He added: ""We will eventually be able to identify anyone who has had a vaccine ahead of their eligibility criteria."" The NHS is currently only offering vaccines to people withinEngland's first four priority groups,external, in line with the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) guidelines. This does not include teachers, unless they also meet age or health-related criteria. The Department for Health and Social Care said: ""It is absolutely critical that vaccines are offered in the priority order, as determined by the JCVI, and we expect everyone involved in vaccinations to follow this guidance closely."" ""Vaccinating these groups first will save the most lives and provide the quickest and safest route out of the pandemic."" Almost 10.5 million people in the UK have now received a first dose of a coronavirus vaccine, according to thegovernment's coronavirus dashboard,,externaland more than 500,000 have received their second dose.

Youngest set for school return this month in Wales,"All schools and colleges in Wales were told to move to online learning at the start of this term Children aged three to seven will return to school after the February half-term, the Welsh Government is expected to confirm on Friday. Most pupils have been learning from home after a surge in Covid cases led to a Welsh lockdown. The decision would mean the foundation phase of primary schools returning from 22 February. But the head of one teaching union said they would not support the move without assurances about teacher safety. Education Minister Kirsty Williams is expected to make the announcement at a lunchtime press conference on Friday. It follows a fall in the number of infections, and negotiations with teaching trade unions, who have called for teachers to be in the priority list for vaccinations. The Welsh Government had been under pressure to set out plans for a return to face-to-face teaching after weeks of lockdown. School return 'unlikely' for all in February Schools return plan 'needs more local Covid work' 'Grave consequences' in closing Wales' schools It comes as other parts of the UK consider when children can return to face-to-face teaching. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said 8 March was the earliest date schools in England could reopen and that""depends on lots of things going right"". In Northern Irelandpupils will not return to school until 8 Marchat the earliest whileScotland's youngest pupils are likely to return to the classroom full time from 22 Februaryas schools start a phased reopening. The Covid case rate in Wales is currently the lowest of the UK nations. It now stands at 126 per 100,000 people over seven days - a fall from about 700 before Christmas. Earlier, teachers' union NASUWT said a joint group of unions had given the Welsh Government a list of ""mitigations"" they wanted to see put in place. They include strict social distancing, medical grade masks for teachers in the foundation phase and a ""further consideration of a flexible and phased return"". Neil Butler, its national officer in Wales, said on Friday the union would not support the return to school unless a number of those mitigations were taken on board. He told BBC Radio Wales: ""We've got no indication of what's going to be changed in the operational guidance which fits into those mitigations that we want to see. ""If the operational guidance has taken nothing on board in terms of the joint union mitigation list then we're not going to be able to support this return on the 22nd."" Ucac general secretary Dilwyn Roberts-Young said there needed to be ""local flexibility to stagger the return of foundation phase children"". ""We'll also need clear guidelines about social distancing, the use of face-coverings, sufficient ventilation, and which staff are exempt from return and can continue to work from home. ""Above all, school staff need to hear that they figure in the government's priority list for vaccination, particularly those in the foundation phase where it is almost impossible to ensure social distancing."" Young children are expected to return to school after half-term All schools and colleges in Wales were toldto move to online learning before the start of this term in an effort to ""suppress the virus"", Ms Williams said at the start of January. Some schools had been due to openin the new year butunions called for the return to be delayedamid concerns about a variant of coronavirus blamed for a rise in cases before Christmas. Schools and colleges have remained open for children of critical workers and vulnerable pupils, as well as for children who needed to complete essential exams or assessments. Victoria Rosser said she had ""mixed emotions"" about the changes Victoria Rosser, a mother of four from Cwmbran, is on the shielding list and is yet to receive her first dose of the Covid vaccine. She said she wants to be able to make the decision over whether it is safe for her children to return to the classroom. ""I have mixed emotions towards the decision being announced today,"" she said. ""I do not feel it's safe for parents and guardians, who've been placed on the shielding list like me, to send their children until phase one of the priority list are post-three weeks of receiving their vaccine. ""Parents are being crippled with having to balance their children's education, work and running a home. This is not home schooling, it's trying to accommodate three jobs at the same time, which is impossible in the long-term."" Meanwhile, Chris Lawrence, who lives in Cardiff and has three children, said it was ""really important"" children get back to school as soon as possible. He said: ""From my perspective what we've been doing in terms of shutting schools, we were always told it would be the last resort, but at the moment it's been adopted as the thing that we do. If your kids are at home then pretty much all parents have to be at home as well."" Samantha Pearce from Blaenau Gwent, who's daughter Hazel is 10, said she didn't want to see year groups rushed back. But she added: ""The prolonged closure of the schools is having a huge detrimental effect. Schools for us here in Blaenau Gwent have been already been closed for two months now - and children are bored an unengaged with the work."" Rachel Antoniazzi, who is deputy head at Thornhill Primary School in Cardiff, said getting children back into school would be a ""relief"" for parents and teachers, but there were also some concerns for staff. She said: ""I do really honestly believe that the type of learning that foundation phase children are expected to do doesn't work very well from home. It puts a lot of pressure on parents, it's not conducive to the way foundation phase learners are expected to learn."" Ms Antoniazzi's school has been operating as a hub for children of key workers during the lockdown, and will continue to do so for the children in the upper years of the school, alongside reopening for the youngest pupils. ""In an ideal world we would love to welcome the whole school back but we have to be really careful,"" she said. ""I think the biggest fear, and the government have to be really clear on this, is that it's a necessity to reopen schools, but it doesn't mean we're back to normal. ""It's better than being at home but I do want parents to get the message that doesn't mean you can go to playdates."" Plaid Cymru's education spokeswoman SiÃ¢n Gwenllian called for school staff and other key workers to be moved to the top of the list in each vaccination priority group. ""Parents, learners and staff need reassurance that the school environment is safe, and there are certainly things that can be done to give them confidence, such as more extensive use of ventilation, school workers moved to the top of their vaccine priority group, and schools must be given all options to enable adequate social distancing in classrooms. ""With a year of hindsight, it pains me to think how much more face-to-face education our children and young people could have had, if Welsh Government had used all the tools in their gift earlier."" Suzy Davies of the Welsh Conservatives questioned the staggered approach Education spokeswoman for the Welsh Conservatives Suzy Davies welcomed the return but questioned the staggered approach. She added: ""It's been a tough period for children, parents and teachers, and it makes sense for primaries to go back to catch up with each other; these youngest pupils have lost most in terms of learning and vital early-years socialisation. ""We need a can-do, will-do approach from ministers as teachers on the front line want to return to the classroom so long as it's safe to do so. ""They must now put plans in place for those critical secondary years, and to get in the maximum amount of learning to prepare our older learners for college and university with an even more dynamic, innovative, flexible and ultimately safe approach to secondary schools."" The first minister said the youngest pupils would be back in school if virus rates carried on falling. A week later, the indicators are going in the right direction, suggesting three to seven-year-olds will be back in classes on or soon after 22 February. But this process feels different to the return after the summer or after the first lockdown. The virus variants have added another layer of anxiety, and the approach is even more cautious. Older primary pupils may have to learn from home for a while longer, and a return for secondary and college pupils, apart from those doing practical qualifications, still seems to be some way off. BITESIZE CYMRU WALES:Educational programmes in English and Welsh LOCKDOWN LEARNING:How can BBC Bitesize help you learn from home? The first easing of the strictest lockdown rules was last Saturday, when people were able to meet one other person from another household to exercise outside. But people in Wales have been warned they are unlikely to see a ""radical and significant"" easing of the restrictions this month. The health minister said there would need to ""continued"" reductions before the rules can be eased. Vaughan Gething added any ""available headroom"" would be used to help children go back to school. The next Welsh lockdown review is scheduled for 19 February.

Dogecoin takes off after tip by Elon MuskThe currency has risen more than 800% in the year so far.,"Dogecoin, a cryptocurrency which started off as a joke, has jumped in value by 50% after inventor Elon Musk dubbed it ""the people's crypto"".

However, with no intrinsic value like gold or land, and no ability to generate an income like a company or bond, cryptocurrencies are extremely volatile and can crash as fast as they rise. This makes them hard to value and makes their prices susceptible to tips from backers or sudden panics. Forget Bitcoin - now Dogecoin goes wild Cryptoasset investors warned they may lose the lot Critics point out that while any given cryptocurrency may have a finite supply of units, the number of cryptocurrencies is ever-growing and potentially limitless. People have lost large amounts of money in steep drops in the value of cryptocurrencies and in hacks and corrupted or lost hard drives. Bitcoin's value dropped by $5,000 on 4 January to about $29,000 before recovering the lost ground. On 11 Jan, it dropped $9,000 to $32,000. Because the cryptocurrencies can pass international borders quickly and are not regulated like cash or regular investments, investigating thefts is hard. Last month, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) issued a stark warning to investors in so-called cryptoassets.

However, with no intrinsic value like gold or land, and no ability to generate an income like a company or bond, cryptocurrencies are extremely volatile and can crash as fast as they rise. This makes them hard to value and makes their prices susceptible to tips from backers or sudden panics. Forget Bitcoin - now Dogecoin goes wild Cryptoasset investors warned they may lose the lot Critics point out that while any given cryptocurrency may have a finite supply of units, the number of cryptocurrencies is ever-growing and potentially limitless. People have lost large amounts of money in steep drops in the value of cryptocurrencies and in hacks and corrupted or lost hard drives. Bitcoin's value dropped by $5,000 on 4 January to about $29,000 before recovering the lost ground. On 11 Jan, it dropped $9,000 to $32,000. Because the cryptocurrencies can pass international borders quickly and are not regulated like cash or regular investments, investigating thefts is hard. Last month, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) issued a stark warning to investors in so-called cryptoassets. The financial watchdog said investors should be ""prepared to lose all their money"" should their investment's value collapse.

UK 'getting safer every day' says vaccines minister,"The UK is ""getting safer every day"" as more people get coronavirus jabs, vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi says Almost 10.5 million people in the UK have now received a first dose of a coronavirus vaccine But a further 915 people have died within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test in the UK UK residents returning from coronavirus hotspots abroad will have to quarantine in hotels from 15 February, the BBC is told The UK's rapid Covid-19 vaccination programme will help the economy rebound strongly this year, the Bank of England says A UK trial has launched to see if giving people different Covid vaccines for first and second doses works as well as giving them the same one twice The Australian Open boss says he is confident the tennis tournament will start on Monday, despite 160 players awaiting Covid tests results The number of patients waiting over an hour to transfer from ambulance teams to A&E staff in England falls to its lowest level this winter Edited by James Clarke and Alex Therrien We're now bringing our live page to a close for the day, but will be back tomorrow. Thanks for joining us. The live page writers today were: Hamish Mackay, Jennifer Meierhans, George Bowden, Sophie Williams and Alice Cuddy. The editors were James Clarke and Alex Therrien. We are going to be bringing our live page to a close soon, but before we do here's a look at some of the day's main coronavirus developments:  ""Obviously we will find a way to survive, because we have to, but it's a lot, lot harder,"" said single mum, Rebecca Failing to extend a Â£20 lockdown benefit boost will harm the health of millions of people for decades, leading health organisations have told Prime Minister Boris Johnson in a letter. Introduced last year, the Â£20-a-week uplift is due to end in April. The introduction of the Â£20 boost had provided a buffer for single mum Rebecca. ""At least I had something coming in,"" she said. ""The Â£20 is mostly food for [my daughter] - I eat whatever I can."" Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey has hinted the government could be moving closer to extending the rise but says there is no decision yet. Read more from the BBC's Michael Buchanan and Judith Burnshere. A Scottish cancer charity says it is starting to see patients who were diagnosed late as a result of the country's first coronavirus lockdown. Cancer Support Scotland says these people will die sooner because cancer services were paused. Cancer services and diagnostic tests in Scotland are now are back up and running and the government has published acancer recovery plan,externalaimed at improving services and outcomes. Kerr Raeburn was a third of the way through his treatment for Hodgkin's Lymphoma when the March lockdown hit. He was able to choose to continue with his treatment and stem cell transplant and is now cancer-free. He says: ""I would be feeing quite despondent if I was told the treatment was cancelled. I just hope that people would eventually get their operations and hopefully not be put at too much risk of relapse and things coming back."" On World Cancer Day, you can read the full storyhere. French Prime Minister Jean Castex has said there are no plans for another national lockdown in the country, but warned the situation there remains fragile. âWe must stick with the current restrictions we already have
in place,â he told a news conference on Thursday. âBut the situation today does
not justify a new national lockdownâ. France currently has a 18:00 curfew in place in a bid to curb
the spread of the virus. Bars, restaurants, museums and gyms remain closed. All
non-essential travel to and from non-EU countries is banned. Castex reminded people that it was âimperativeâ to work
from home whenever possible and called on people to do everything they can do to avoid a third lockdown. UK residents travelling to England from certain ""high risk"" countries will soon have to quarantine in government-sanctioned hotels so the measure can be more strictly enforced. The rule will apply to areas associated with new coronavirus variants including South America, Portugal and many countries in Southern Africa. The BBC has been told the system will begin on 15 February (see ourprevious post). But which countries are on the banned list? Read morein our explainer. The system of managed hotel quarantine for UK residents arriving into England from ""red list"" countries will begin on 15 February, government sources have told the BBC. The BBC has seen a document that sets out the date and
estimates that hotels will be asked to provide accommodation for more than
1,000 people a day. Ministers are expected to confirm full details soon. They
had faced criticism from Labour for failing to implement the scheme,
more than a month after the South African variant was detected. Scotland's First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said earlier that the Scottish government's plans for managed quarantine would go further than those elsewhere in the UK. Read morehere. An NHS leader has warned against a fast relaxation of coronavirus measures, describing health workers as being ""at full stretch"". NHS Providers chief executive Chris Hopson said the health service's intensive care capacity was running at 170% of last year's, with an upcoming cold snap due to increase pressure further. In aseries of tweets,external, Hopson said NHS staff were ""deeply exhausted & fatigued having worked at fever pitch intensity for many weeks"". He added: ""The NHS has barely crested the peak and it's still at an extremely high altitude under huge pressure. The descent down the mountain has only just started and we don't know how steep the down slope will be. We also know that the descent will likely take months, not days/weeks. ""We saw last year what happened when we released restrictions on social contact too quickly. The impact of the vaccination will help significantly... over time. But to save lives and reduce patient harm, we need a cautious, evidence-based approach to relaxing the restrictions."" NHS Providers is a membership organisation that represents health service and ambulance NHS trusts. The Harry Potter spin-off stars Eddie Redmayne Filming on the third Fantastic Beasts film has halted after a ""team member"" tested positive for coronavirus. The Harry Potter spin-off, which stars Eddie Redmayne and Jude Law, is being shot at Warner Brothers Studios in Leavesden, Hertfordshire. Warner Bros Pictures says the diagnosis came as a result of ""ongoing testing"" all those working on Fantastic Beasts 3 receive. It says production has ""paused"" and theemployee is in isolation. Yolande KnellBBC Middle East correspondent, Jerusalem The Hamas authorities in the Gaza Strip have fully lifted restrictions there after a significant drop in the number of coronavirus cases. Gazaâs seaside cafes, busy shopping centres, mosques and gyms will be fully reopened for the start of the local weekend for the first time in two months. Students will now be allowed to return to schools and universities full-time. Strict quarantine measures as well as Gazaâs relative isolation meant it didnât see its first public outbreak of coronavirus until August. There had been fears a serious Covid outbreak could overwhelm the weak healthcare system in the Palestinian Territory, which has long been under blockade by Israel and Egypt. A strict lockdown initially imposed in Gaza was later replaced by night-time curfews and weekend closures. Now Hamas officials â under pressure to reopen the economy - say the fall in numbers of new cases and those being treated in hospital mean restrictions are no longer needed. No Covid vaccines have yet been sent to Gaza. This video can not be played Covid in Scotland: Snow impact on vaccinations 'concerning' Earlier, Scotland's First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, admitted to concerns about the impact of poor weather conditions on the country's Covid vaccination programme. However, she said plans were in place to help protect the rollout of the jab during the wintry weather. The Met Office has issued an amber warning for ""heavy and persistent"" snow for much of the north of Scotland. The Highlands, Aberdeenshire, Tayside and Perthshire are expected to be the worst affected. More than 10 million first vaccine doses have now been given to people in the UK. The seven-day average for daily doses is currently 430,532. The number of patients in hospital with coronavirus remains high, with 31,670 people hospitalised as of 2 February. This is below the latest peak of hospitalisations seen last month. The number of daily coronavirus cases reported continues to fall, with the seven-day average now 21,246 new cases per day. The government is ""risking lives"" by being too slow to implement a hotel quarantine plan, Labour has claimed. Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced in January that UK residents returning from Covid hotspots would have to quarantine in hotels, but a timetable has not yet been set. Labour has written to Home Secretary Priti Patel to urge her to end the delays and get on with it. But ministers insist there is not a delay and they are working on the scheme ""at pace"" and an announcement will be made next week. Here's the full story. London Underground staff have been told to continue to work, despite a ""stay at home"" plea from the government over concerns with the South African Covid-19 variant. In an emailseen by the LDRS, Transport for London (TfL) told those who cannot work from home to continue working as normal and encouraged them to get a Covid test. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said it is ""critical"" thatpeople in areas singled out for enhanced testing for the South African variantstay at home - this includes parts of London. The RMT union, which represents Tube workers, has called TfLâs advice âtotally unacceptableâ. TfL insists it is still following Government and Public Health England advice and says it is regularly communicating with trade unions. ""We continue to follow our robust cleaning regime and social distancing measures to reduce the risk of infection in the workplace,"" a TfL spokesperson added. Casa Cruz, in Notting Hill A restaurant that broke lockdown rules to host Rita Ora's 30th birthday will not have its licence revoked. The pop star's team offered the manager at Casa Cruz, in Notting Hill, Â£5,000to allow guests to attenda party on 28 November, amid the second virus lockdown, police say. Kensington and Chelsea Council has announced it will suspend Casa Cruz's licence for six weeks. The venue's parent company has been approached for comment. Rita Ora has previouslyapologised for the party. The 30-year-old flew to Egypt for a private performance on 21 November. On her return the following day, she should have isolated for two weeks. Instead, she threw a birthday party in London, which violated lockdown rules that prevented households mixing indoors. Read the full story here. Nathan Orme was jailed at Douglas Courthouse for six weeks A man whose friend visited his home during the Isle of Man's second coronavirus lockdown has been jailed. Nathan Orme, 28, told police the person who had been at his home to get a phone charger was part of his ""bubble"", despite no such rules existing on the island, Douglas Courthouse heard. He admitted to breaking the island's strict Covid-19 laws prohibiting indoor gatherings. Orme, of Anagh Coar Road in Douglas, was sentenced to six weeks in prison. Defence advocate Stephen Wood told the court Orme was a ""damaged man"" and had done ""nothing criminal"" other than meeting with his friend. Orme was previously fined Â£500 for breaking self-isolation rules in May last year after leaving his home following an argument with his girlfriend. Here's the full story. A medical centre received angry calls and one staff member was threatened after players at a nearby football club were given Covid vaccines. Chesterfield FC said some players and staff, ""most of them vulnerable"", were given jabs to stop them being wasted. However, the medical centre which gave the vaccines has received dozens of angry phone calls since news of the vaccinations appeared in the media. One threatened a female member of staff, saying he knew where she lived, prompting police to investigate. Read morehere. Philippa RoxbyHealth reporter, BBC News The number of people who have died within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test in the UK has risen by another 915 today. It means the death toll by this measure is now in excess of 110,000. But after weeks of mounting deaths since mid-December, there are positive signs deaths are finally reducing. In the past week, daily recorded deaths have been lower than every corresponding day in the previous week. And the last time the daily deaths figure was below 1,000 (apart from on a Sunday and Monday when the numbers are usually much lower because of delayed reporting after a weekend) was on 5 January. That was just as lockdown restrictions were being introduced and children were told not to return to school for the new term. Much has changed since then: Hospitals have been under intense pressure because of Covid-19 and millions of people have been vaccinated against the disease. Confirmed cases and hospital admissions have been falling â usually an early indication that the numbers dying will also follow. However, there are clear warnings from health officials that there should be no complacency. Vaccinating the most vulnerable will reduce deaths initially, but it will take many millions more vaccinations for all the over-50s and those with underlying conditions to really reduce the pressure on the countryâs hospitals. All Piers says he wants to do is go to school every day. He doesn't even want a holiday - just school, school and more school. The 18-year-old, who has a form of autism, has not been able to finish the final year of his maths GCSE full-time in the classroom with his friends and teachers because of lockdown. Like some of his friends, Piers has only been in class one day a week - and the restrictions are having a serious impact on their learning. Read morehere. Sweden is developing a digital vaccine certificate to enable
people to show they have been inoculated. The countryâs health minister  Lena Hallengren said the certificate could be used as a passport to âtravel abroad on holiday or
meet a loved oneâ. The government is hoping to get the certificates ready by June. Digitalisation Minister Anders Ygeman said businesses
including restaurants could ask customers to prove they have been
vaccinated,The Local reports,external. Sweden has recorded more than 580,000 cases and 11,939 deaths. The move comes a day after Denmark announced a similar certificate. The
government there announced it would have an online registry that would be used
to check someoneâs vaccination status. This is a temporary measure until a
long-term solution is established. The World Health Organisation has considered the idea
of digital certificates in the past but said last month that it opposed them
being used as a requirement for travel. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
US 'to end support' for Yemen offensive operations,"Millions in Yemen are in need of food, medicine or shelter after more than six years of war The US is to end its support for offensive operations by its allies in Yemen, which has been devastated by a six-year war in which more than 110,000 people are believed to have died. ""The war in Yemen must end,"" President Joe Biden said in his first major foreign policy speech. Under Mr Biden's two predecessors, the US backed a coalition led by Saudi Arabia against Houthi rebels in Yemen. The conflict has left millions of Yemenis on the brink of starvation. Fighting began in 2014 between a weak Yemeni government and the Houthi rebel movement. It escalated a year later, when Saudi Arabia and eight other Arab states - backed by the US, the UK and France - began air strikes against the Houthis. Biden vows US 'reset' in foreign policy speech Mr Biden announced other changes to US foreign policy, such as a significant increase in the number of refugees accepted by the US. His speech marks a sharp break with the policies of former President Donald Trump, who left office last month. On Russia, for instance, the new US leader said: ""I made it clear to President [Vladimir] Putin, in a manner very different from my predecessor, that the days of the United States rolling over in the face of Russia's aggressive actionsâ¦ are over."" The comments drew fierce criticism from the Kremlin. ""This is very aggressive, unconstructive rhetoric, to our regret,"" Mr Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Friday. The US has been backing the Yemeni government and its Saudi-led allies in their war against the Houthis. As a result of Thursday's announcement, the US will stop supporting offensive operations, including the sale of precision-guided munitions to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). This will not affect operations against al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. The Biden administration had already put a temporary halt on arms sales to Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Can Biden get the Saudis to change course? Why is there a war in Yemen? The rise of Yemen's Houthi rebels Mr Biden isexpected to name his new Yemen envoy as Tim Lenderking, an experienced diplomat and Middle East specialist,external. This marks a change of tack from Mr Trump's administration, which increased support for the Saudi-led coalition. Last month Mr Trump's Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, announced thatthe Houthis were being designated a ""terrorist organisation"". He said the aim was to hold the Houthis accountable for cross-border attacks and deter ""malign activity"" by their backer Iran. Aid organisations criticised the move, warning that it could prevent them from operating in areas where millions are in urgent need of food aid. Last week, the Biden administration said it would exempt certain transactions involving the Houthis from sanctions. That exemption will expire on 26 February. The United Nations says Yemen is the world's worst humanitarian crisis, with 80% of the population in need of aid or protection. This video can not be played (November 2020) Three Yemeni teens share how their lives have changed These announcements confirm President Biden's pledge to end Yemen's destructive war. Halting US support to the Saudi-led coalition's offensive operations won't close this bloody chapter, but it sends a strong signal to leaders in Riyadh and Abu Dhabi - they've also been trying to find ways to extricate themselves from this quagmire. Achieving peace among Yemen's bitter enemies will be a monumental challenge. Tim Lenderking is set to be the first US envoy for Yemen since this war was unleashed nearly six years ago. He's worked on this file for years and is known to everyone who matters. Western diplomats, as well as Yemenis, have welcomed this new US engagement. In 2015, President Obama gave a green light to the Saudi-led campaign, partly to ease the Kingdom's anger over the Iran nuclear deal. Now new US envoys on Yemen, and Iran, are tasked with ending this war, and the regional rivalries which still fuel it. The US will raise the cap onrefugee admissionsfrom 15,000 to 125,000 for the fiscal year. Thewithdrawal of US troopsfrom Germany will be frozen and forces will remain at their current level of about 36,000. Under Mr Trump, the US was going to reduce its presence by 12,000, with about 5,600 to be deployed elsewhere in Europe. Mr Biden called onMyanmar's military rulers to release civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi and restore democracy. He also promised to engage diplomatically withRussiabut to be tougher on Moscow than Mr Trump, saying the US would not ""roll over"".

Unionism 'coming together' to oppose NI Protocol,"Graffiti has appeared in a number of areas showing opposition to the NI Protocol There has been a ""coming together of unionism"" in recent days to oppose the NI Protocol, Arlene Foster has said. On Tuesday, the DUPpublished a five-point planaimed at scrapping the NI part of the Brexit deal. It called for unity among unionist parties, who say the protocol damages trade and threatens the UK union. But Sinn FÃ©in has said the protocol must remain in place, insisting there would ""always be difficulties"" in implementing it. The protocol was designed to ensure an open border between NI and the Republic of Ireland. Instead there are checks on some products travelling from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, but unionists oppose this border up the Irish Sea. Speaking at a news conference on Thursday, Mrs Foster said the ""disappointment"" for her was that the EU had not acknowledged the protocol was causing disruption to trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. UK and EUleaders met on Wednesday night, following a move by the EU to trigger an emergency mechanism, known as Article 16, to override the protocol amid a row on vaccine exports. The EU later reversed the decision but faced widespread criticism for the move. Mrs Foster demanded action be taken by the British government to overturn the current protocol arrangements, and issued a direct message to unionists. ""Part of the difficulty in unionism is that sometimes when confronted with difficult circumstances they turn in on themselves, and start to look for lundys [traitors] they can blame for that,"" she added. ""But since the actions of the EU last Friday I have seen a coming together of unionism. ""My plea is not to turn in on ourselves."" What is the Northern Ireland Protocol? She said the government had ""sleepwalked"" into the protocol, and that it should be scrapped before then looking at the risks to the EU's single market. Mrs Foster said her party wanted people to respond in a calm way, adding: ""It's important to focus on constitutional politics."" Arlene Foster told The View the UK government recognised ""action was needed"" Speaking on BBC NI's The View on Thursday evening, the first minister said she believed there had been ""a shift in emphasis"" from the UK government ""since the actions of the European Union last Friday"". ""Since then we have seen the government respond to the difficulties of the protocol in a more meaningful way,"" she said. ""No longer are we hearing from government talk about teething problems, we're now hearing them talk about significant problems between Great Britain and Northern Ireland."" Mrs Foster added there was ""recognition in government"" that action is needed ""and it needs to be soon"". The finance minister, Sinn Fein's Conor Murphy, said parties had a responsibility to provide ""calm leadership"" and ensure businesses could be given advantages through the protocol. ""You can't change trading arrangements without difficulties. Not just unionists are suffering, everyone will in some ways but it can't all be attributed to the protocol,"" he said. Mr Murphy argued that some businesses had not prepared fully before the protocol took effect on 1 January, and criticised the British government for ""leaving it right to the wire"". Conor Murphy and Arlene Foster take opposing views on Brexit and the NI Protocol Earlier, the Republic of Ireland's foreign minister insisted that the protocol was ""not going to be changed. Simon Coveney said there were problems with implementation, but that the protocol contained ""flexibilities"". The UK government has asked the EU for temporary lighter enforcement of the rules to be extended until early 2023. But the European Commission's chief spokesman said grace periods were always meant to be of a ""temporary nature"" and were ""subject to strict conditions of their application"". Speaking at a daily press briefing, Eric Mamer said it was up to the joint committee involving the UK government and the EU to find a way forward. Discussions between the UK and EU on managing the protocol are due to continue next week. It follows the withdrawal of staff from NI ports afterthreats were issued. Simon Coveney said there were problems with implementation, but the protocol will not be changed On Thursday, Mr Coveney told BBC News NI there were some ""genuine concerns"" with the protocol, although his government wanted to be helpful in ensuring its implementation. ""The flexibilities that are already there for Northern Ireland are grace periods for certain elements of the protocol that don't need to be implemented straight away in Northern Ireland, for example supermarkets don't have to have health certifications in order to import products from GB,"" he outlined. ""We want the protocol to function in a way that works for everybody, north and south on the island of Ireland. ""We talk to and listen to businesses in Northern Ireland as well as south of the border and we want to work with them."" Mr Coveney said the row on Friday overwhether the EU would trigger Article 16, which allows an override of the protocol, created more tension. It will take a few months, he added, ""to make sure it can be implemented in full"". Meanwhile, government minister Lord True said Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove had made it clear to EU Vice-President Maros Sefcovic that their ""focus must be on making the Protocol work in the interest of people and businesses in Northern Ireland"". The comments were made during a debate in the House of Lords following an urgent question from Conservative peer Lord Caine. DUP deputy leader Lord Dodds said the problems around the protocol could only be fixed through ""renegotiation or action by the government"". Ulster Unionist peer Lord Empey accused the EU of using Northern Ireland as ""political football"" and asked what alternatives were being considered for negotiation by the government with the EU. Lord Caine called on the government to take ""robust measures"" if both sides fail to agree a solution which protects the Belfast Agreement and respects the integrity of the UK.

Teenage torture killers win anonymity fight,"Angela Wrightson was subjected to a seven-hour attack in her home Two teenagers who tortured and murdered a vulnerable woman in her own home have been granted lifelong anonymity. The girls were 13 and 14 when they subjected Angela Wrightson, 39, to a vicious attack in Hartlepool. Both were jailed for a minimum of 15 years in April 2016. They were not named then because of their age and an interim injunction extended that anonymity after they turned 18. On Thursday, the High Court upheld the ban on naming the pair. At a hearing in London last year, their barrister arguedboth teenagers suffer from ""recognisable mental conditions""and were ""extremely psychologically vulnerable"", adding they would be at ""a very significant risk"" of being attacked if their identities were revealed. In her ruling, Mrs Justice Tipples was unconvinced by arguments based on the threat of attack by others, but upheld the anonymity orders on mental health grounds and the risk of self-harm. Miss Wrightson, pictured aged 34, had let her killers into her Hartlepool home Miss Wrightson died after being subjected to an attack lasting seven hours. She was hit with a shovel, a TV, a coffee table and a stick studded with screws after she let the pair into her Stephen Street home in December 2014. The girls posted a photograph on Snapchat showing them smiling with Miss Wrightson pictured in the background shortly before her death. A chaotic life and brutal death The friendship that ended in murder The murder victim and the media blackout In her judgement, in which the teenagers were referred to as D and F, Mrs Justice Tipples said the killing had ""resulted in public outrage and revulsion, together with public concern about how these two young girls could commit such a brutal murder"". However, she went on to describe it as ""an exceptional case in which the balance is tipped very firmly in favour"" of protecting the pair's right to remain anonymous. ""The trial took place in public and was fully reported at the time it took place. All matters relating to this offence are in the public domain, except for the identities of D and F. ""I am clear on the evidence before me that revealing the claimants' identities is likely to cause each of them very serious harm. ""It is both necessary and proportionate to grant the injunctions sought so that both their identities are protected and not revealed."" Lifelong anonymity is so rare there are only nine convicted criminals who have this protection in England and Wales, plus a number of their descendants. The individuals given this exceptional protection include the killers of James Bulger - the case that set the test for future orders - and, more recently, Britain's once-youngest teenager to be convicted of a terrorism plot. Under the law, the state must take reasonable steps to protect everyone's right to life. In other words, the long-term personal safety of the offender outweighs the legal rights of the media and the public to identify them. In the Wrightson case, there was another very important consideration. A member of court staff saved Child F from killing herself during the trial. The compelling medical evidence for her anonymity application showed she would become suicidal again if she were named now she is an adult. And so, under the law, it's that right to life - and perhaps a chance for rehabilitation - that means the two young women will never be named. The court was told D's mental health had ""deteriorated"" as she approached being moved to an adult prison, while F had an ""extensive history of mental health problems"". Mrs Justice Tipples concluded: ""I will give judgment in favour of the claimants and grant permanent injunctions preventing them from being identified.""

What are negative interest rates?,"High street banks in countries with negative interest rates have so far been reluctant to pass them on to customers The Bank of England has taken another step towards adding negative interest rates to its crisis-fighting toolbox. It's givenHigh Street banks six monthsto be operationally ready for them. Policymakers stressed that this did not mean that sub-zero borrowing costs were ""imminent, or indeed in prospect"". But what exactly are negative interest rates? And could a world where savers are penalised and borrowers rewarded end up doing more harm than good? The term ""interest rates"" is often used interchangeably with the Bank of England base rate. Described as the ""single most important interest rate,externalin the UK"", the base rate determines how much interest the Bank of England pays to financial institutions that hold money with it, and what it charges them to borrow. High street banks also use it to determine how much interest they pay to savers, as well as what they charge people who take out a loan or mortgage. The Bank of England usually lowers interest rates when it wants people to spend more and save less. It cut them to afresh low of 0.1% in March 2020to try to stimulate the economy amid thecoronavirus pandemic. In theory, taking interest rates below zero should have the same effect. But in practice, it's a bit more complicated. After all, why would anyone pay to stash money in a savings account or lend someone money, when they can keep the cash at home for free? The Bank of England's number one job is to keep prices across the economy rising steadily every year. This is known as the Bank's inflation target, which is set at 2% by the government. Inflation measures how quickly the cost of living is rising. And, measured by the consumer prices index (CPI), itstood at 0.6% in December, up from 0.3% in November 2020. While low inflation means prices aren't rising quickly, if it remains low for too long, bosses start factoring that into pay reviews. This can then dampen consumer confidence and spending. Central banks have been cutting interest rates to spur inflation for years. But as rates approached zero across the developed world, a handful went a step further. Sweden, Switzerland, Japan and the 19 nations of the eurozone all took interest rates below zero. In Switzerland, negative interest rates have also helped to discourage investors from pouring money into the country during times of uncertainty. British savers have already seen their returns dwindle in recent years. The average UK instant access account pays just 0.12%, according to the Bank of England, while accounts that require you to lock your money away currently offer an average return of 0.51%. In countries with sub-zero interest rates, commercial banks have passed them on to big companies. However, the evidence suggests there is a very high bar to pass the pain on to ordinary savers. Christina Nyman, chief economist at Swedish lender Handelsbanken, says charging savers to put money in their own accounts is seen as ""taboo"" in Sweden. She says: ""Competition is fierce, and households are ready to move their money to another bank, so nobody wants to lose business."" Swiss banks UBS and Credit Suisse only impose negative rates on deposits of more than 2 million Swiss francs. In Germany, where some banks impose charges on deposits of more than â¬100,000 (Â£90,000), some people have started stashing their money in vaults. German demand for bank vaults has risen since the European Central Bank introduced negative interest rates. According to Germany's central bank, physical cash holdings by families and businesses there have almost trebled to â¬43.4bn since the European Central Bank (ECB) introduced a negative deposit rate in 2014. But David Oxley at Capital Economics says there hasn't been a wider shift towards cash because most people still prefer the security and convenience of keeping it in the bank. Putting it in a vault ""runs the risk of the money either being lost, stolen, or damaged,"" he says. ""Bank deposits cannot catch fire, but banknotes can."" What is the UK's inflation rate? What is GDP? How will we pay for the coronavirus crisis? Negative rate mortgages already exist. In 2019, Danish bank Jyske announced that it would effectively pay borrowers 0.5% a year to take out a 10-year loan. James Pomeroy, an economist at HSBC, says this was only possible because of the nature of the mortgage market. When someone in Denmark applies for a home loan, Danish banks act as a middleman between potential borrowers and investors. ""In Denmark the banks don't take the hit, investors do,"" says Mr Pomeroy. ""Banks are then charging higher product fees, so have actually made money off of this."" But negative rate mortgages are unlikely to be offered in the UK any time soon. When UK interest rates were slashed to 0.5% in March 2009, some borrowers thought they could be in line for a payment. Around 1,500 Cheltenham and Gloucester customers,externalhad a mortgage that tracked 1.01 percentage points below the Bank of England base rate. But any prospect of a windfall was quickly dashed when financial regulators described interest payments as ""a one-way obligation on the borrower"". Around 1,500 Cheltenham & Gloucester borrowers did not benefit from negative interest rates when the Bank of England slashed rates to 0.5% in 2009. In a letter to UK bank bosses,external, Sam Woods, chief executive of the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA), said some lenders would need up to 18 months to make permanent changes needed to deal with negative rates. While ""short-term fixes"" could be implemented within six months, upgrading systems not built to deal with a negative Bank of England base rate would take longer, especially for some mortgage customers. Banks said they would find it easier to explain and implement changes to big corporate clients, because many already had international experience with negative rates. What are the side effects of negative interest rates? Negative interest rates hit bank earnings by squeezing the gap between the money they make on loans and what they pay to savers. ""If not passed on to customers, negative rates would hurt bank profitability, especially at a time when they are expected to be hit by crisis-related loan losses,"" says Danae Kyriakopoulou, chief economist at the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum (OMFIF). Building societies like the Nationwide look after Â£1 in every Â£5 of British savings Negative interest rates pose a particular challenge to building societies, which hold around Â£1 of every Â£5 in British savings accounts. While commercial banks can access cheaper borrowing by tapping financial markets, building societies must raise at least half their funding from individual savers.

Firms 'in the dark' over post lockdown reopening,"Business leaders have called on the government to work with them on a roadmap out of lockdown to unlock investment for a post-Covid recovery. In a letter to Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng, the Confederation of British Industry says the time to plan for re-opening the economy in England is now. Firms are ""in the dark"" about planning for the months ahead, the employers' group said. A government spokesperson said lockdown would be lifted as soon as possible. But the CBI, which speaks on behalf of about 190,000 businesses, said there is an opportunity to ""use time wisely"" to prepare for a safe re-opening of the economy. In a letter to Mr Kwarteng, CBI director-general Tony Danker, writes: ""With health teams rightly in crisis management mode, we in business along with the economic ministries can use this time to plan for a successful re-opening of the economy when the moment is right to do so. ""Businesses are currently completely in the dark when planning for the weeks and months ahead and this is hindering investment. We can provide more clarity and do the prep work now to enable them to plan for reopening and growth."" CBI calls for more business support before Budget Firms urge fresh financial aid to survive lockdown Mr Danker will also be writing to the devolved nations' governments next week. The CBI calls for clarification on what will be considered low, medium or high-risk economic activity, so that businesses can understand what will open sooner or later. Mr Danker also wants to know whether or not there will be a return to tiering, as part of a gradual re-opening. He also wants the creation of bespoke, detailed plans for the harder-to-open sectors of the economy, such as testing regimes for international travel, or the conditions for activities such as hospitality and live events to return. The CBI wrote to Mr Kwarteng on Monday, and will write to to the devolved nations' governments next week. Mr Danker says in the letter: ""The Prime Minister has set out the initial parameters for reopening as a country, which was a big help for businesses. Clearly, the precise dates will be determined by data, so let's use this time wisely to get the roadmap right together for when lockdown ends. ""A common framework with devolved administrations must also be possible and help to minimise differences in approach."" Chancellor Rishi Sunak is working on a recovery plan, expected to be published ahead of next month's Budget. That plan will, according to reports, focus on jobs and investment. A government spokesperson said: ""As the prime minister has made clear, we will lift restrictions as soon as we can, but by lifting them too soon we run the risk of placing our NHS under even greater pressure and having to re-impose restrictions at a later date."" The spokesperson pointed out that the government had invested more than Â£280bn during the pandemic to protect jobs and businesses, adding: ""By mid-February we will be in a better position to lay out the next steps for the economy without risking renewed pressure on our NHS.""

French Prime Minister Jean Castex has said there are no plans for another national lockdown in the country, but warned the situation there remains fragile. âWe must stick with the current restrictions we already have
in place,â he told a news conference on Thursday. âBut the situation today does
not justify a new national lockdownâ. France currently has a 18:00 curfew in place in a bid to curb
the spread of the virus. Bars, restaurants, museums and gyms remain closed. All
non-essential travel to and from non-EU countries is banned. Castex reminded people that it was âimperativeâ to work
from home whenever possible and called on people to do everything they can do to avoid a third lockdown. UK residents travelling to England from certain ""high risk"" countries will soon have to quarantine in government-sanctioned hotels so the measure can be more strictly enforced. The rule will apply to areas associated with new coronavirus variants including South America, Portugal and many countries in Southern Africa. The BBC has been told the system will begin on 15 February (see ourprevious post). But which countries are on the banned list? Read morein our explainer. The system of managed hotel quarantine for UK residents arriving into England from ""red list"" countries will begin on 15 February, government sources have told the BBC. The BBC has seen a document that sets out the date and
estimates that hotels will be asked to provide accommodation for more than
1,000 people a day. Ministers are expected to confirm full details soon. They
had faced criticism from Labour for failing to implement the scheme,
more than a month after the South African variant was detected. Scotland's First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said earlier that the Scottish government's plans for managed quarantine would go further than those elsewhere in the UK. Read morehere. An NHS leader has warned against a fast relaxation of coronavirus measures, describing health workers as being ""at full stretch"". NHS Providers chief executive Chris Hopson said the health service's intensive care capacity was running at 170% of last year's, with an upcoming cold snap due to increase pressure further. In aseries of tweets,external, Hopson said NHS staff were ""deeply exhausted & fatigued having worked at fever pitch intensity for many weeks"". He added: ""The NHS has barely crested the peak and it's still at an extremely high altitude under huge pressure. The descent down the mountain has only just started and we don't know how steep the down slope will be. We also know that the descent will likely take months, not days/weeks. ""We saw last year what happened when we released restrictions on social contact too quickly. The impact of the vaccination will help significantly... over time.

Warner Bros Pictures says the diagnosis came as a result of ""ongoing testing"" all those working on Fantastic Beasts 3 receive. It says production has ""paused"" and theemployee is in isolation. Yolande KnellBBC Middle East correspondent, Jerusalem The Hamas authorities in the Gaza Strip have fully lifted restrictions there after a significant drop in the number of coronavirus cases. Gazaâs seaside cafes, busy shopping centres, mosques and gyms will be fully reopened for the start of the local weekend for the first time in two months. Students will now be allowed to return to schools and universities full-time. Strict quarantine measures as well as Gazaâs relative isolation meant it didnât see its first public outbreak of coronavirus until August. There had been fears a serious Covid outbreak could overwhelm the weak healthcare system in the Palestinian Territory, which has long been under blockade by Israel and Egypt. A strict lockdown initially imposed in Gaza was later replaced by night-time curfews and weekend closures. Now Hamas officials â under pressure to reopen the economy - say the fall in numbers of new cases and those being treated in hospital mean restrictions are no longer needed. No Covid vaccines have yet been sent to Gaza. This video can not be played Covid in Scotland: Snow impact on vaccinations 'concerning' Earlier, Scotland's First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, admitted to concerns about the impact of poor weather conditions on the country's Covid vaccination programme. However, she said plans were in place to help protect the rollout of the jab during the wintry weather. The Met Office has issued an amber warning for ""heavy and persistent"" snow for much of the north of Scotland. The Highlands, Aberdeenshire, Tayside and Perthshire are expected to be the worst affected. More than 10 million first vaccine doses have now been given to people in the UK. The seven-day average for daily doses is currently 430,532. The number of patients in hospital with coronavirus remains high, with 31,670 people hospitalised as of 2 February. This is below the latest peak of hospitalisations seen last month. The number of daily coronavirus cases reported continues to fall, with the seven-day average now 21,246 new cases per day. The government is ""risking lives"" by being too slow to implement a hotel quarantine plan, Labour has claimed. Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced in January that UK residents returning from Covid hotspots would have to quarantine in hotels, but a timetable has not yet been set. Labour has written to Home Secretary Priti Patel to urge her to end the delays and get on with it. But ministers insist there is not a delay and they are working on the scheme ""at pace"" and an announcement will be made next week. Here's the full story. London Underground staff have been told to continue to work, despite a ""stay at home"" plea from the government over concerns with the South African Covid-19 variant.

Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said it is ""critical"" thatpeople in areas singled out for enhanced testing for the South African variantstay at home - this includes parts of London. The RMT union, which represents Tube workers, has called TfLâs advice âtotally unacceptableâ. TfL insists it is still following Government and Public Health England advice and says it is regularly communicating with trade unions. ""We continue to follow our robust cleaning regime and social distancing measures to reduce the risk of infection in the workplace,"" a TfL spokesperson added.

Chesterfield FC said some players and staff, ""most of them vulnerable"", were given jabs to stop them being wasted. However, the medical centre which gave the vaccines has received dozens of angry phone calls since news of the vaccinations appeared in the media. One threatened a female member of staff, saying he knew where she lived, prompting police to investigate. Read morehere. Philippa RoxbyHealth reporter, BBC News The number of people who have died within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test in the UK has risen by another 915 today. It means the death toll by this measure is now in excess of 110,000. But after weeks of mounting deaths since mid-December, there are positive signs deaths are finally reducing. In the past week, daily recorded deaths have been lower than every corresponding day in the previous week. And the last time the daily deaths figure was below 1,000 (apart from on a Sunday and Monday when the numbers are usually much lower because of delayed reporting after a weekend) was on 5 January. That was just as lockdown restrictions were being introduced and children were told not to return to school for the new term. Much has changed since then: Hospitals have been under intense pressure because of Covid-19 and millions of people have been vaccinated against the disease. Confirmed cases and hospital admissions have been falling â usually an early indication that the numbers dying will also follow. However, there are clear warnings from health officials that there should be no complacency. Vaccinating the most vulnerable will reduce deaths initially, but it will take many millions more vaccinations for all the over-50s and those with underlying conditions to really reduce the pressure on the countryâs hospitals. All Piers says he wants to do is go to school every day. He doesn't even want a holiday - just school, school and more school.

long-term solution is established. The World Health Organisation has considered the idea
of digital certificates in the past but said last month that it opposed them

"Law change to allow maternity leave for ministerUnder current rules, Attorney General Suella Braverman would have to resign to get paid leave.","The government is to update the law so that the attorney general can take six months' maternity leave. Suella Braverman, the government's chief law officer, announced in November she was expecting her second child ""early next year"". She would be one of the most senior government ministers to give birth in office. Under current laws, she would have to resign if she wanted to take time off following the birth. The government has announced a new law to formalise the process for ministerial maternity leave, which until now has been at the discretion of the prime minister. TheMinisterial and other Maternity Allowances Bill,externalwill allow cabinet ministers to receive up to six months' leave on full pay. At the moment, legislation from the 1970s means the prime minister does not normally have the flexibility to pay a cabinet minister maternity leave alongside paying a salary to their temporary replacement. New mothers 'need better job protection' 'Locum MP' to cover Stella Creasy maternity The bill would allow Ms Braverman and other cabinet ministers to take six months' leave on full pay - similar to more junior government roles and the civil service. Several female politicians serving as junior ministers have taken maternity leave in the past, including Conservative MPs Tracey Crouch and Kemi Badenoch. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said his party would back the bill, adding the change ""should have been brought in a long time ago"". The party's shadow cabinet office minister, Rachel Reeves, said the measures were a ""small but significant step forward"" but the government needed to go further and make provision for paternity, adoption and shared parental leave. Introducing the new measuresin a written statement,,externalthe prime minister said: ""The choice between taking leave to recover from childbirth and care for a new-born child or resigning from office is not acceptable in modern times."" Boris Johnson acknowledged that provisions needed to be made for leave for adoption, sickness and other circumstances. Ministers aren't subject to normal employee rights because they're appointed, and fired, by the prime minister. Many will be surprised to learn that Suella Braverman will become the first cabinet minister to take paid maternity leave. It's a generous scheme which will grant six months of full pay - under current rules, she would have had to resign or be demoted to qualify. The bill is being rushed through Parliament because she's due to give birth soon, but Labour wants to revisit the issue later to include paternity leave. The years of muddling through on an informal basis will end next Thursday. Ms Braverman, the Conservative MP for Fareham, became the second-ever woman to be appointed attorney general for England and Wales in February 2020. She had previously served as a junior Brexit minister under Theresa May, beforeresigning in November 2018in protest at the former PM's Brexit plans. She went on to take maternity leave whilst serving as a backbench MP after the birth of her first child in July 2019, with a ""proxy MP"" taking part in parliamentary debates and votes on her behalf. Labour's Tulip Siddiq delayed a caesarean section to take part in a vote All MPs are paid in full while on maternity, paternity or adoption leave. But not all their duties in Parliament are covered during their absence: Conservative MP Tracey Crouch,externalwas the first Conservative minister to take maternity leave in 2016.

""The introduction of cover for ministers is long overdue, and this legislation reveals the lie I was told when I asked for maternity cover that MPs employment status made it impossible."" Ms Creasy added: ""What message does it send to the thousands of pregnant women facing redundancy and job insecurity in the pandemic or any of those considering entering public life at any level, if parliament treats maternity leave as a bonus like a company car to be given only to those at the top?"" Women are entitled to up to 52 weeks' maternity leave They must take at least two weeks' leave after the baby is born (or four weeks if they work in a factory) They are eligible to be paid for six weeks at 90% of their average weekly earnings and 33 weeks at Â£151 per week or 90% of their average weekly earnings (if lower) Fathers can take two weeks' statutory paternity leave at up to Â£151 a week Some couples are also entitled to shared parental leave of up to 50 weeks and 37 weeks of pay Should parental leave be extended due to coronavirus?

"Law change to allow maternity leave for ministerUnder current rules, Attorney General Suella Braverman would have to resign to get paid leave.UK Politics","The government is to update the law so that the attorney general can take six months' maternity leave. Suella Braverman, the government's chief law officer, announced in November she was expecting her second child ""early next year"". She would be one of the most senior government ministers to give birth in office. Under current laws, she would have to resign if she wanted to take time off following the birth. The government has announced a new law to formalise the process for ministerial maternity leave, which until now has been at the discretion of the prime minister. TheMinisterial and other Maternity Allowances Bill,externalwill allow cabinet ministers to receive up to six months' leave on full pay. At the moment, legislation from the 1970s means the prime minister does not normally have the flexibility to pay a cabinet minister maternity leave alongside paying a salary to their temporary replacement. New mothers 'need better job protection' 'Locum MP' to cover Stella Creasy maternity The bill would allow Ms Braverman and other cabinet ministers to take six months' leave on full pay - similar to more junior government roles and the civil service. Several female politicians serving as junior ministers have taken maternity leave in the past, including Conservative MPs Tracey Crouch and Kemi Badenoch. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said his party would back the bill, adding the change ""should have been brought in a long time ago"". The party's shadow cabinet office minister, Rachel Reeves, said the measures were a ""small but significant step forward"" but the government needed to go further and make provision for paternity, adoption and shared parental leave. Introducing the new measuresin a written statement,,externalthe prime minister said: ""The choice between taking leave to recover from childbirth and care for a new-born child or resigning from office is not acceptable in modern times."" Boris Johnson acknowledged that provisions needed to be made for leave for adoption, sickness and other circumstances. Ministers aren't subject to normal employee rights because they're appointed, and fired, by the prime minister. Many will be surprised to learn that Suella Braverman will become the first cabinet minister to take paid maternity leave. It's a generous scheme which will grant six months of full pay - under current rules, she would have had to resign or be demoted to qualify. The bill is being rushed through Parliament because she's due to give birth soon, but Labour wants to revisit the issue later to include paternity leave. The years of muddling through on an informal basis will end next Thursday. Ms Braverman, the Conservative MP for Fareham, became the second-ever woman to be appointed attorney general for England and Wales in February 2020. She had previously served as a junior Brexit minister under Theresa May, beforeresigning in November 2018in protest at the former PM's Brexit plans. She went on to take maternity leave whilst serving as a backbench MP after the birth of her first child in July 2019, with a ""proxy MP"" taking part in parliamentary debates and votes on her behalf. Labour's Tulip Siddiq delayed a caesarean section to take part in a vote All MPs are paid in full while on maternity, paternity or adoption leave. But not all their duties in Parliament are covered during their absence: Conservative MP Tracey Crouch,externalwas the first Conservative minister to take maternity leave in 2016.  She said she had been unsure about accepting the job of sports minister because she wanted to start family Chloe Smithinterrupted her maternity leave in 2017 to take part in a vote - becoming the first Conservative MP to bring their baby in to the Commons chamber In 2019, Labour MPTulip Siddiqwent against the advice of her doctors and delayed a planned caesarean section so she could take part in a crucial Brexit vote Labour'sStella Creasywas given permission to appoint a ""locum MP"" to cover her maternity leave in 2019 Father-of-three Conservative MPBim Afolami,externalwas the first dad able to vote by proxy when he took paternity leave Responding to the change, Ms Creasy said: ""In no other workplace would guaranteed paid maternity leave and cover be only the preserve of the management. ""The introduction of cover for ministers is long overdue, and this legislation reveals the lie I was told when I asked for maternity cover that MPs employment status made it impossible."" Ms Creasy added: ""What message does it send to the thousands of pregnant women facing redundancy and job insecurity in the pandemic or any of those considering entering public life at any level, if parliament treats maternity leave as a bonus like a company car to be given only to those at the top?"" Women are entitled to up to 52 weeks' maternity leave They must take at least two weeks' leave after the baby is born (or four weeks if they work in a factory) They are eligible to be paid for six weeks at 90% of their average weekly earnings and 33 weeks at Â£151 per week or 90% of their average weekly earnings (if lower) Fathers can take two weeks' statutory paternity leave at up to Â£151 a week Some couples are also entitled to shared parental leave of up to 50 weeks and 37 weeks of pay Should parental leave be extended due to coronavirus?

How high could the unemployment rate go?,"The Labour government has announced a series of measures to get more people into jobs, arguing that it has inherited a country that ""isn't working"". Its plans, announced by Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, include overhauling the health and disability benefits system and improving mental health support. About a quarter of the working age population - those aged 16 to 64 - do not currently have a job. That's about 11 million people. According to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS),4.3% of people were unemployed in the period between July and September 2024,external, which is about 1.5 million people. While this figure has risen over the last two years, unemployment remains relatively low by historical standards. However, the unemployed represent only a small part of the nearly 11 million working-age people who don't have a paid job. About 9.3 million of them are not called ""unemployed"". That is because they are not actively looking for work, or available to start a job. Insteadpeople in this group are called ""economically inactive"",external. In fact, more of them say they want a job - 1.9 million people - than are officially unemployed - 1.5 million. That means there are far more people who say they are available to or want to work than there are vacancies - 0.8 million. And thenumber of vacancies,externalhas been falling consistently for the last two years. It varies according to age. ONS figures for 2023 show that most of the 2.7 million ""inactive"" under-25s were students. The majority of them did not want a job. You can see that in the graphic below. Click on the darker border surrounding any age group to see the spilt between men and women. Your device may not support this visualisation Things are different in other age groups. Among 25- to 49-year-olds, 1.1 million people did not work because of caring responsibilities, about a million of whom are women. Nearly one million people in this age group were not working because of illness - more evenly split between men and women. The main reasons that 3.5 million over-50s were out of the job market were illness and early retirement. Almost nobody who retired early said they wanted to return to work. Aroundhalf of people with disabilities,externaldid not have a paid job, a rate that is more than double the rest of the working-age population. Less than a quarter of those who were sick or caring said they wanted a job. Sick people leaving workforce at record highs Many people are not looking for work because they are studying, caring or have retired. Some people want to work but cannot, either becausechildcare is too expensiveor they are not well enough. As the chart below shows, caring responsibilities and ill-health are the most common reasons for inactivity given by those who would like a paid job. Chart on the reason inactive people wanting to work don't The number of people not working has a broader effect. A smaller workforce means the government raises lessincome tax and National Insurance, which it uses to pay for services like the NHS. It may also spend more on benefits. Since people on benefits generally have less money than those in work, it also means less spending on the high street. That in turn is bad for businesses, and can affect how many people they employ, which can mean there are fewer jobs for those who do want to work. During the Covid pandemic, all major countries saw their workforce shrink. But while many other leading economies have since recovered, the UK still has more people out of its workforce than it did in 2019. There is a debate about how much of this is down toproblems with how we work out how many people are inactive,external. Before Covid, the UK's ""inactivity rate"" was the second lowest inthe G7 club of leading economies, behind Japan. The increase in the inactive population since then, if accurate, would now place the UK behind the US, France and Italy. The independentOffice for Budget Responsibility,external- which assesses how well the UK economy is doing - has suggested that ill-health has consistently been a bigger factor in the UK than in other advanced economies. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer hasset out a plan to get two million more people into work. The proposals include: overhauling the health and disability benefits system to better support people to get jobs and stay in work rebranding job centres as the National Jobs and Careers Service offering every 18 to 21-year-old in England an apprenticeship, training or education opportunities or help to find a job as part of a new ""Youth Guarantee"" an independent review of what UK employers are doing to promote health and inclusive workplaces providing more money for the North East, South Yorkshire and West Yorkshire to stop people leaving work because of ill health expanding mental-health support and efforts to tackle obesity. The prime minister said the reforms would ""put an end to the culture of blaming and shaming people who for too long haven't been getting the support they need to get back to work"". But many details of what they will mean in practice have not been confirmed, and a review of sickness benefits will not begin until 2025. The proposals follow widespread criticism from businesses thatthe increase in National Insurance announced in the Budget, coupled withthe rise in the minimum wage, will make it harder for them to create new jobs. Companies warn this will undermine the government's goal of increasing the working population.

Dangerous products remain for sale on Wish,"This hairdryer was among the items BBC Watchdog brought to the firm's attention Products that could cause electric shock or fires remain for sale on Wish.com despite being highlighted in a BBC Watchdog investigation. Hair clippers and a hair dryer were among items flagged on Wednesday. They are still available on Wish's site. The US company's failure to remove them was ""extremely concerning"", the charity Electrical Safety First's chief executive Lesley Rudd said. Wish said sellers on its platform were responsible for their goods' safety. But it has not responded to a question about why it has not removed the listings now the matter has been brought to its attention. Shoppers warned against buying cheap electronics online Amazon and eBay 'listing unsafe toys for sale' The dangerous items highlighted in the BBC's Watchdog programme, on Tuesday evening on The One Show, included: a scooter charger with an illegal clove-shaped plug an extension lead that can cause electric shock a hair dryer with an illegal clove-shaped plug a travel adaptor lacking safety shutters, leaving internal live components exposed hair clippers with a substandard adaptor a car-battery charger with an illegal clove-shaped plug In response to the findings, Wish, which sells more than 150 million different products, told Watchdog it would ""take down any products if evidence was shown to prove they were unsafe"" and refund customers who had bought them. One safety expert said the plug on this charger was undersized posing a risk of a serious electric shock But it was up to individual sellers to check products conformed to safety regulations. Ms Rudd said: ""These items pose a serious risk of harm to those who purchase them and are illegal for sale to UK consumers."" She urged the government to step in ""to protect online shoppers from the real threat substandard electrical goods pose"". The Online Harms Bill, being considered by Parliament, could be a good place to include legislation about dangerous electrical goods, Ms Rudd suggested. Previous investigationsfrom Consumer group Which? have found unsafe goods on eBay and Amazon. And campaigners want the government to make online marketplaces legally responsible for goods sold on their platforms. Wish has also been repeatedly reprimanded by the Advertising Standards Authority for inappropriately targeted advertising, including an ""overtly sexual"" ad, with a woman wearing nipple tassels,which featured on the BBC's Good Food Guide app. Danger products: 'I heard a loud crackle and bang' Nipple tassel ad in BBC recipe app earns reprimand LA fire chief warns of further destruction from high winds as 10 confirmed dead What's the latest on the LA fires, and why can't they be put out?

Introduced last year, the Â£20-a-week uplift is due to end in April. The introduction of the Â£20 boost had provided a buffer for single mum Rebecca. ""At least I had something coming in,"" she said. ""The Â£20 is mostly food for [my daughter] - I eat whatever I can."" Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey has hinted the government could be moving closer to extending the rise but says there is no decision yet.

A Scottish cancer charity says it is starting to see patients who were diagnosed late as a result of the country's first coronavirus lockdown. Cancer Support Scotland says these people will die sooner because cancer services were paused. Cancer services and diagnostic tests in Scotland are now are back up and running and the government has published acancer recovery plan,externalaimed at improving services and outcomes. Kerr Raeburn was a third of the way through his treatment for Hodgkin's Lymphoma when the March lockdown hit. He was able to choose to continue with his treatment and stem cell transplant and is now cancer-free. He says: ""I would be feeing quite despondent if I was told the treatment was cancelled. I just hope that people would eventually get their operations and hopefully not be put at too much risk of relapse and things coming back."" On World Cancer Day, you can read the full storyhere. French Prime Minister Jean Castex has said there are no plans for another national lockdown in the country, but warned the situation there remains fragile. âWe must stick with the current restrictions we already have
in place,â he told a news conference on Thursday. âBut the situation today does
not justify a new national lockdownâ. France currently has a 18:00 curfew in place in a bid to curb
the spread of the virus. Bars, restaurants, museums and gyms remain closed. All
non-essential travel to and from non-EU countries is banned. Castex reminded people that it was âimperativeâ to work
from home whenever possible and called on people to do everything they can do to avoid a third lockdown. UK residents travelling to England from certain ""high risk"" countries will soon have to quarantine in government-sanctioned hotels so the measure can be more strictly enforced. The rule will apply to areas associated with new coronavirus variants including South America, Portugal and many countries in Southern Africa. The BBC has been told the system will begin on 15 February (see ourprevious post). But which countries are on the banned list? Read morein our explainer. The system of managed hotel quarantine for UK residents arriving into England from ""red list"" countries will begin on 15 February, government sources have told the BBC. The BBC has seen a document that sets out the date and
estimates that hotels will be asked to provide accommodation for more than
1,000 people a day. Ministers are expected to confirm full details soon. They
had faced criticism from Labour for failing to implement the scheme,
more than a month after the South African variant was detected. Scotland's First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said earlier that the Scottish government's plans for managed quarantine would go further than those elsewhere in the UK. Read morehere. An NHS leader has warned against a fast relaxation of coronavirus measures, describing health workers as being ""at full stretch"". NHS Providers chief executive Chris Hopson said the health service's intensive care capacity was running at 170% of last year's, with an upcoming cold snap due to increase pressure further. In aseries of tweets,external, Hopson said NHS staff were ""deeply exhausted & fatigued having worked at fever pitch intensity for many weeks"". He added: ""The NHS has barely crested the peak and it's still at an extremely high altitude under huge pressure. The descent down the mountain has only just started and we don't know how steep the down slope will be. We also know that the descent will likely take months, not days/weeks. ""We saw last year what happened when we released restrictions on social contact too quickly. The impact of the vaccination will help significantly... over time. But to save lives and reduce patient harm, we need a cautious, evidence-based approach to relaxing the restrictions."" NHS Providers is a membership organisation that represents health service and ambulance NHS trusts. The Harry Potter spin-off stars Eddie Redmayne Filming on the third Fantastic Beasts film has halted after a ""team member"" tested positive for coronavirus. The Harry Potter spin-off, which stars Eddie Redmayne and Jude Law, is being shot at Warner Brothers Studios in Leavesden, Hertfordshire. Warner Bros Pictures says the diagnosis came as a result of ""ongoing testing"" all those working on Fantastic Beasts 3 receive. It says production has ""paused"" and theemployee is in isolation. Yolande KnellBBC Middle East correspondent, Jerusalem The Hamas authorities in the Gaza Strip have fully lifted restrictions there after a significant drop in the number of coronavirus cases. Gazaâs seaside cafes, busy shopping centres, mosques and gyms will be fully reopened for the start of the local weekend for the first time in two months. Students will now be allowed to return to schools and universities full-time. Strict quarantine measures as well as Gazaâs relative isolation meant it didnât see its first public outbreak of coronavirus until August. There had been fears a serious Covid outbreak could overwhelm the weak healthcare system in the Palestinian Territory, which has long been under blockade by Israel and Egypt. A strict lockdown initially imposed in Gaza was later replaced by night-time curfews and weekend closures. Now Hamas officials â under pressure to reopen the economy - say the fall in numbers of new cases and those being treated in hospital mean restrictions are no longer needed. No Covid vaccines have yet been sent to Gaza. This video can not be played Covid in Scotland: Snow impact on vaccinations 'concerning' Earlier, Scotland's First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, admitted to concerns about the impact of poor weather conditions on the country's Covid vaccination programme. However, she said plans were in place to help protect the rollout of the jab during the wintry weather. The Met Office has issued an amber warning for ""heavy and persistent"" snow for much of the north of Scotland. The Highlands, Aberdeenshire, Tayside and Perthshire are expected to be the worst affected. More than 10 million first vaccine doses have now been given to people in the UK. The seven-day average for daily doses is currently 430,532. The number of patients in hospital with coronavirus remains high, with 31,670 people hospitalised as of 2 February. This is below the latest peak of hospitalisations seen last month. The number of daily coronavirus cases reported continues to fall, with the seven-day average now 21,246 new cases per day. The government is ""risking lives"" by being too slow to implement a hotel quarantine plan, Labour has claimed. Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced in January that UK residents returning from Covid hotspots would have to quarantine in hotels, but a timetable has not yet been set. Labour has written to Home Secretary Priti Patel to urge her to end the delays and get on with it. But ministers insist there is not a delay and they are working on the scheme ""at pace"" and an announcement will be made next week. Here's the full story. London Underground staff have been told to continue to work, despite a ""stay at home"" plea from the government over concerns with the South African Covid-19 variant. In an emailseen by the LDRS, Transport for London (TfL) told those who cannot work from home to continue working as normal and encouraged them to get a Covid test. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said it is ""critical"" thatpeople in areas singled out for enhanced testing for the South African variantstay at home - this includes parts of London. The RMT union, which represents Tube workers, has called TfLâs advice âtotally unacceptableâ. TfL insists it is still following Government and Public Health England advice and says it is regularly communicating with trade unions. ""We continue to follow our robust cleaning regime and social distancing measures to reduce the risk of infection in the workplace,"" a TfL spokesperson added. Casa Cruz, in Notting Hill A restaurant that broke lockdown rules to host Rita Ora's 30th birthday will not have its licence revoked.

Nathan Orme was jailed at Douglas Courthouse for six weeks A man whose friend visited his home during the Isle of Man's second coronavirus lockdown has been jailed. Nathan Orme, 28, told police the person who had been at his home to get a phone charger was part of his ""bubble"", despite no such rules existing on the island, Douglas Courthouse heard. He admitted to breaking the island's strict Covid-19 laws prohibiting indoor gatherings. Orme, of Anagh Coar Road in Douglas, was sentenced to six weeks in prison. Defence advocate Stephen Wood told the court Orme was a ""damaged man"" and had done ""nothing criminal"" other than meeting with his friend. Orme was previously fined Â£500 for breaking self-isolation rules in May last year after leaving his home following an argument with his girlfriend. Here's the full story. A medical centre received angry calls and one staff member was threatened after players at a nearby football club were given Covid vaccines. Chesterfield FC said some players and staff, ""most of them vulnerable"", were given jabs to stop them being wasted. However, the medical centre which gave the vaccines has received dozens of angry phone calls since news of the vaccinations appeared in the media. One threatened a female member of staff, saying he knew where she lived, prompting police to investigate. Read morehere. Philippa RoxbyHealth reporter, BBC News The number of people who have died within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test in the UK has risen by another 915 today. It means the death toll by this measure is now in excess of 110,000. But after weeks of mounting deaths since mid-December, there are positive signs deaths are finally reducing. In the past week, daily recorded deaths have been lower than every corresponding day in the previous week. And the last time the daily deaths figure was below 1,000 (apart from on a Sunday and Monday when the numbers are usually much lower because of delayed reporting after a weekend) was on 5 January. That was just as lockdown restrictions were being introduced and children were told not to return to school for the new term. Much has changed since then: Hospitals have been under intense pressure because of Covid-19 and millions of people have been vaccinated against the disease. Confirmed cases and hospital admissions have been falling â usually an early indication that the numbers dying will also follow. However, there are clear warnings from health officials that there should be no complacency. Vaccinating the most vulnerable will reduce deaths initially, but it will take many millions more vaccinations for all the over-50s and those with underlying conditions to really reduce the pressure on the countryâs hospitals. All Piers says he wants to do is go to school every day. He doesn't even want a holiday - just school, school and more school.

Like some of his friends, Piers has only been in class one day a week - and the restrictions are having a serious impact on their learning. Read morehere. Sweden is developing a digital vaccine certificate to enable
people to show they have been inoculated. The countryâs health minister  Lena Hallengren said the certificate could be used as a passport to âtravel abroad on holiday or
meet a loved oneâ. The government is hoping to get the certificates ready by June. Digitalisation Minister Anders Ygeman said businesses
including restaurants could ask customers to prove they have been
vaccinated,The Local reports,external. Sweden has recorded more than 580,000 cases and 11,939 deaths. The move comes a day after Denmark announced a similar certificate. The
government there announced it would have an online registry that would be used
to check someoneâs vaccination status. This is a temporary measure until a
long-term solution is established. The World Health Organisation has considered the idea
of digital certificates in the past but said last month that it opposed them
being used as a requirement for travel. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."

However, she said plans were in place to help protect the rollout of the jab during the wintry weather. The Met Office has issued an amber warning for ""heavy and persistent"" snow for much of the north of Scotland. The Highlands, Aberdeenshire, Tayside and Perthshire are expected to be the worst affected. More than 10 million first vaccine doses have now been given to people in the UK. The seven-day average for daily doses is currently 430,532. The number of patients in hospital with coronavirus remains high, with 31,670 people hospitalised as of 2 February. This is below the latest peak of hospitalisations seen last month. The number of daily coronavirus cases reported continues to fall, with the seven-day average now 21,246 new cases per day. The government is ""risking lives"" by being too slow to implement a hotel quarantine plan, Labour has claimed. Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced in January that UK residents returning from Covid hotspots would have to quarantine in hotels, but a timetable has not yet been set. Labour has written to Home Secretary Priti Patel to urge her to end the delays and get on with it. But ministers insist there is not a delay and they are working on the scheme ""at pace"" and an announcement will be made next week. Here's the full story. London Underground staff have been told to continue to work, despite a ""stay at home"" plea from the government over concerns with the South African Covid-19 variant. In an emailseen by the LDRS, Transport for London (TfL) told those who cannot work from home to continue working as normal and encouraged them to get a Covid test. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said it is ""critical"" thatpeople in areas singled out for enhanced testing for the South African variantstay at home - this includes parts of London. The RMT union, which represents Tube workers, has called TfLâs advice âtotally unacceptableâ. TfL insists it is still following Government and Public Health England advice and says it is regularly communicating with trade unions. ""We continue to follow our robust cleaning regime and social distancing measures to reduce the risk of infection in the workplace,"" a TfL spokesperson added. Casa Cruz, in Notting Hill A restaurant that broke lockdown rules to host Rita Ora's 30th birthday will not have its licence revoked. The pop star's team offered the manager at Casa Cruz, in Notting Hill, Â£5,000to allow guests to attenda party on 28 November, amid the second virus lockdown, police say. Kensington and Chelsea Council has announced it will suspend Casa Cruz's licence for six weeks. The venue's parent company has been approached for comment. Rita Ora has previouslyapologised for the party. The 30-year-old flew to Egypt for a private performance on 21 November. On her return the following day, she should have isolated for two weeks. Instead, she threw a birthday party in London, which violated lockdown rules that prevented households mixing indoors. Read the full story here. Nathan Orme was jailed at Douglas Courthouse for six weeks A man whose friend visited his home during the Isle of Man's second coronavirus lockdown has been jailed. Nathan Orme, 28, told police the person who had been at his home to get a phone charger was part of his ""bubble"", despite no such rules existing on the island, Douglas Courthouse heard. He admitted to breaking the island's strict Covid-19 laws prohibiting indoor gatherings. Orme, of Anagh Coar Road in Douglas, was sentenced to six weeks in prison. Defence advocate Stephen Wood told the court Orme was a ""damaged man"" and had done ""nothing criminal"" other than meeting with his friend. Orme was previously fined Â£500 for breaking self-isolation rules in May last year after leaving his home following an argument with his girlfriend. Here's the full story. A medical centre received angry calls and one staff member was threatened after players at a nearby football club were given Covid vaccines. Chesterfield FC said some players and staff, ""most of them vulnerable"", were given jabs to stop them being wasted. However, the medical centre which gave the vaccines has received dozens of angry phone calls since news of the vaccinations appeared in the media. One threatened a female member of staff, saying he knew where she lived, prompting police to investigate. Read morehere. Philippa RoxbyHealth reporter, BBC News The number of people who have died within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test in the UK has risen by another 915 today. It means the death toll by this measure is now in excess of 110,000. But after weeks of mounting deaths since mid-December, there are positive signs deaths are finally reducing. In the past week, daily recorded deaths have been lower than every corresponding day in the previous week. And the last time the daily deaths figure was below 1,000 (apart from on a Sunday and Monday when the numbers are usually much lower because of delayed reporting after a weekend) was on 5 January. That was just as lockdown restrictions were being introduced and children were told not to return to school for the new term. Much has changed since then: Hospitals have been under intense pressure because of Covid-19 and millions of people have been vaccinated against the disease. Confirmed cases and hospital admissions have been falling â usually an early indication that the numbers dying will also follow. However, there are clear warnings from health officials that there should be no complacency. Vaccinating the most vulnerable will reduce deaths initially, but it will take many millions more vaccinations for all the over-50s and those with underlying conditions to really reduce the pressure on the countryâs hospitals. All Piers says he wants to do is go to school every day. He doesn't even want a holiday - just school, school and more school. The 18-year-old, who has a form of autism, has not been able to finish the final year of his maths GCSE full-time in the classroom with his friends and teachers because of lockdown. Like some of his friends, Piers has only been in class one day a week - and the restrictions are having a serious impact on their learning. Read morehere. Sweden is developing a digital vaccine certificate to enable
people to show they have been inoculated. The countryâs health minister  Lena Hallengren said the certificate could be used as a passport to âtravel abroad on holiday or
meet a loved oneâ. The government is hoping to get the certificates ready by June. Digitalisation Minister Anders Ygeman said businesses
including restaurants could ask customers to prove they have been
vaccinated,The Local reports,external. Sweden has recorded more than 580,000 cases and 11,939 deaths. The move comes a day after Denmark announced a similar certificate. The
government there announced it would have an online registry that would be used
to check someoneâs vaccination status. This is a temporary measure until a
long-term solution is established. The World Health Organisation has considered the idea
of digital certificates in the past but said last month that it opposed them
being used as a requirement for travel. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Teenage torture killers win anonymity fightThe two girls were 13 and 14 when they attacked Angela Wrightson  over seven hours.,"Angela Wrightson was subjected to a seven-hour attack in her home Two teenagers who tortured and murdered a vulnerable woman in her own home have been granted lifelong anonymity. The girls were 13 and 14 when they subjected Angela Wrightson, 39, to a vicious attack in Hartlepool. Both were jailed for a minimum of 15 years in April 2016. They were not named then because of their age and an interim injunction extended that anonymity after they turned 18. On Thursday, the High Court upheld the ban on naming the pair. At a hearing in London last year, their barrister arguedboth teenagers suffer from ""recognisable mental conditions""and were ""extremely psychologically vulnerable"", adding they would be at ""a very significant risk"" of being attacked if their identities were revealed. In her ruling, Mrs Justice Tipples was unconvinced by arguments based on the threat of attack by others, but upheld the anonymity orders on mental health grounds and the risk of self-harm. Miss Wrightson, pictured aged 34, had let her killers into her Hartlepool home Miss Wrightson died after being subjected to an attack lasting seven hours. She was hit with a shovel, a TV, a coffee table and a stick studded with screws after she let the pair into her Stephen Street home in December 2014. The girls posted a photograph on Snapchat showing them smiling with Miss Wrightson pictured in the background shortly before her death. A chaotic life and brutal death The friendship that ended in murder The murder victim and the media blackout In her judgement, in which the teenagers were referred to as D and F, Mrs Justice Tipples said the killing had ""resulted in public outrage and revulsion, together with public concern about how these two young girls could commit such a brutal murder"". However, she went on to describe it as ""an exceptional case in which the balance is tipped very firmly in favour"" of protecting the pair's right to remain anonymous. ""The trial took place in public and was fully reported at the time it took place. All matters relating to this offence are in the public domain, except for the identities of D and F. ""I am clear on the evidence before me that revealing the claimants' identities is likely to cause each of them very serious harm. ""It is both necessary and proportionate to grant the injunctions sought so that both their identities are protected and not revealed."" Lifelong anonymity is so rare there are only nine convicted criminals who have this protection in England and Wales, plus a number of their descendants. The individuals given this exceptional protection include the killers of James Bulger - the case that set the test for future orders - and, more recently, Britain's once-youngest teenager to be convicted of a terrorism plot. Under the law, the state must take reasonable steps to protect everyone's right to life. In other words, the long-term personal safety of the offender outweighs the legal rights of the media and the public to identify them. In the Wrightson case, there was another very important consideration. A member of court staff saved Child F from killing herself during the trial. The compelling medical evidence for her anonymity application showed she would become suicidal again if she were named now she is an adult. And so, under the law, it's that right to life - and perhaps a chance for rehabilitation - that means the two young women will never be named. The court was told D's mental health had ""deteriorated"" as she approached being moved to an adult prison, while F had an ""extensive history of mental health problems"". Mrs Justice Tipples concluded: ""I will give judgment in favour of the claimants and grant permanent injunctions preventing them from being identified."" The ruling contains provision for a review ""in the event there is a material change of circumstances"".

Covid trial to examine mixing different vaccines,"A UK trial has been launched to see if giving people different Covid vaccines for their first and second doses works as well as the current approach of using the same type of vaccine twice. The idea is to provide more flexibility with vaccine rollout and help deal with any potential disruption to supplies. Scientists say mixing jabs could also possibly give even better protection. The vaccines minister said no changes would be made to the UK's current approach until at least the summer. Currently,official guidance,externalfrom the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) says anyone already given the Pfizer-BioNTech or Oxford-AstraZeneca jab as part of the UK's approved immunisation programme should get the same vaccine for both doses. There is no suggestion this will change, although in very rare circumstancesa different vaccine can be used,external- if only one vaccine is available, or it's not known which was given for the first dose. Vaccines Minister Nadhim Zahawi said the government's taskforce had given about Â£7m to fund the study, but that findings would not be available until the summer and therefore ""at the moment, we're not changing anything at all"". Previous experience suggests mixing vaccines could be a beneficial approach - some Ebola immunisation programmes involve mixing different jabs to improve protection, for example. And Mr Zahawi told BBC Breakfast that this has been done with other vaccines such as jabs for hepatitis, polio and measles, mumps and rubella. New vaccine 'ready by autumn' to tackle mutations The vaccines that work - and the others on the way Study showing vaccine slows virus spread 'superb' The Com-Cov study, run by the National Immunisation Schedule Evaluation Consortium, will involve more than 800 volunteers. The study will be recruiting,externalpeople aged 50 or older, who have not yet received a Covid vaccine, in London, Birmingham, Liverpool, Nottingham, Bristol, Oxford and Southampton. Some will receive the Oxford jab followed by the Pfizer vaccine or vice versa, four or 12 weeks apart. Other vaccines may be added as they are approved by regulators. The chief investigator, Prof Matthew Snape from the University of Oxford, said the ""tremendously exciting study"" would provide information vital for vaccine rollouts in the UK and globally. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that animal studies have shown ""a better antibody response with a mixed schedule rather than the straight schedule"" of vaccine doses. ""It will be really interesting to see if the different delivery methods actually could lead to an enhanced immune response [in humans],"" he said, ""or at least a response that's as good as giving the straight schedule of the same doses"". While this study was initially designed to provide greater flexibility for vaccine rollouts, there is the tantalising possibility that mixing vaccines could provide even better, longer-lasting protection. The Oxford vaccine, for example, uses a harmless virus - almost like a viral postman - to deliver the key part of the vaccine (the bit with coronavirus's genetic code) into the body. This bit of code helps train the body's immune system to recognise coronavirus and prepare defences to fight it off in the future. When a second dose of the same vaccine is given, there is some evidence to suggest that our immune systems can shift a bit of their focus onto the viral postman - rather than coronavirus itself. The hope is that by mixing up jabs, this will allow our immune systems to focus more fully on building up protection against coronavirus. Approaching the challenge using various vaccine combinations may strengthen results. Other countriesare conducting similar studies to monitor the impact of mixing vaccines. Scientists will monitor volunteers for side-effects and carry out blood tests to see how well their immune systems respond. Fact-checking President Macron's vaccine claim Trials to combine Oxford and Sputnik vaccines How many people have been vaccinated so far? The full study will continue for 13 months but scientists hope they will be able to announce some initial findings by June. The study will also provide data on: The impact of the vaccines on new variants The effects of second doses at four and 12 weeks This video can not be played WATCH: Pfizer v Oxford v Moderna â three Covid-19 vaccines compared England's deputy chief medical officer, Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, said there were ""definitive advantages"" to learning whether or not vaccine doses could be mixed, given the ""challenges"" of the vast number of people needing a jab and potential global supply constraints. He said combining vaccines could lead to better protection, ""giving even higher antibody levels that last longer"". Any changes to the UK's current strategy would need approval from the JCVI.

More than 10 million people in the UKhave received at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine.

Mr Zahawi said after that target has been met, a detailed timeline will be set out for the next set of priority groups, including people aged 50 to 69.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced in January that UK residents returning from Covid hotspots would have to quarantine in hotels, but a timetable has not yet been set. Labour has written to Home Secretary Priti Patel to urge her to end the delays and get on with it. But ministers insist there is not a delay and they are working on the scheme ""at pace"" and an announcement will be made next week. Here's the full story. London Underground staff have been told to continue to work, despite a ""stay at home"" plea from the government over concerns with the South African Covid-19 variant. In an emailseen by the LDRS, Transport for London (TfL) told those who cannot work from home to continue working as normal and encouraged them to get a Covid test. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said it is ""critical"" thatpeople in areas singled out for enhanced testing for the South African variantstay at home - this includes parts of London. The RMT union, which represents Tube workers, has called TfLâs advice âtotally unacceptableâ. TfL insists it is still following Government and Public Health England advice and says it is regularly communicating with trade unions. ""We continue to follow our robust cleaning regime and social distancing measures to reduce the risk of infection in the workplace,"" a TfL spokesperson added. Casa Cruz, in Notting Hill A restaurant that broke lockdown rules to host Rita Ora's 30th birthday will not have its licence revoked. The pop star's team offered the manager at Casa Cruz, in Notting Hill, Â£5,000to allow guests to attenda party on 28 November, amid the second virus lockdown, police say. Kensington and Chelsea Council has announced it will suspend Casa Cruz's licence for six weeks. The venue's parent company has been approached for comment. Rita Ora has previouslyapologised for the party. The 30-year-old flew to Egypt for a private performance on 21 November. On her return the following day, she should have isolated for two weeks. Instead, she threw a birthday party in London, which violated lockdown rules that prevented households mixing indoors. Read the full story here. Nathan Orme was jailed at Douglas Courthouse for six weeks A man whose friend visited his home during the Isle of Man's second coronavirus lockdown has been jailed. Nathan Orme, 28, told police the person who had been at his home to get a phone charger was part of his ""bubble"", despite no such rules existing on the island, Douglas Courthouse heard. He admitted to breaking the island's strict Covid-19 laws prohibiting indoor gatherings. Orme, of Anagh Coar Road in Douglas, was sentenced to six weeks in prison. Defence advocate Stephen Wood told the court Orme was a ""damaged man"" and had done ""nothing criminal"" other than meeting with his friend. Orme was previously fined Â£500 for breaking self-isolation rules in May last year after leaving his home following an argument with his girlfriend. Here's the full story. A medical centre received angry calls and one staff member was threatened after players at a nearby football club were given Covid vaccines. Chesterfield FC said some players and staff, ""most of them vulnerable"", were given jabs to stop them being wasted. However, the medical centre which gave the vaccines has received dozens of angry phone calls since news of the vaccinations appeared in the media. One threatened a female member of staff, saying he knew where she lived, prompting police to investigate. Read morehere. Philippa RoxbyHealth reporter, BBC News The number of people who have died within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test in the UK has risen by another 915 today. It means the death toll by this measure is now in excess of 110,000. But after weeks of mounting deaths since mid-December, there are positive signs deaths are finally reducing. In the past week, daily recorded deaths have been lower than every corresponding day in the previous week. And the last time the daily deaths figure was below 1,000 (apart from on a Sunday and Monday when the numbers are usually much lower because of delayed reporting after a weekend) was on 5 January. That was just as lockdown restrictions were being introduced and children were told not to return to school for the new term. Much has changed since then: Hospitals have been under intense pressure because of Covid-19 and millions of people have been vaccinated against the disease. Confirmed cases and hospital admissions have been falling â usually an early indication that the numbers dying will also follow. However, there are clear warnings from health officials that there should be no complacency. Vaccinating the most vulnerable will reduce deaths initially, but it will take many millions more vaccinations for all the over-50s and those with underlying conditions to really reduce the pressure on the countryâs hospitals. All Piers says he wants to do is go to school every day. He doesn't even want a holiday - just school, school and more school. The 18-year-old, who has a form of autism, has not been able to finish the final year of his maths GCSE full-time in the classroom with his friends and teachers because of lockdown. Like some of his friends, Piers has only been in class one day a week - and the restrictions are having a serious impact on their learning. Read morehere. Sweden is developing a digital vaccine certificate to enable
people to show they have been inoculated. The countryâs health minister  Lena Hallengren said the certificate could be used as a passport to âtravel abroad on holiday or
meet a loved oneâ. The government is hoping to get the certificates ready by June. Digitalisation Minister Anders Ygeman said businesses
including restaurants could ask customers to prove they have been
vaccinated,The Local reports,external. Sweden has recorded more than 580,000 cases and 11,939 deaths. The move comes a day after Denmark announced a similar certificate. The
government there announced it would have an online registry that would be used
to check someoneâs vaccination status. This is a temporary measure until a
long-term solution is established. The World Health Organisation has considered the idea
of digital certificates in the past but said last month that it opposed them
being used as a requirement for travel. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Covid trial to examine mixing different vaccinesGiving different first and second jabs could offer more flexibility and may offer better protection.,"A UK trial has been launched to see if giving people different Covid vaccines for their first and second doses works as well as the current approach of using the same type of vaccine twice. The idea is to provide more flexibility with vaccine rollout and help deal with any potential disruption to supplies. Scientists say mixing jabs could also possibly give even better protection. The vaccines minister said no changes would be made to the UK's current approach until at least the summer. Currently,official guidance,externalfrom the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) says anyone already given the Pfizer-BioNTech or Oxford-AstraZeneca jab as part of the UK's approved immunisation programme should get the same vaccine for both doses. There is no suggestion this will change, although in very rare circumstancesa different vaccine can be used,external- if only one vaccine is available, or it's not known which was given for the first dose. Vaccines Minister Nadhim Zahawi said the government's taskforce had given about Â£7m to fund the study, but that findings would not be available until the summer and therefore ""at the moment, we're not changing anything at all"". Previous experience suggests mixing vaccines could be a beneficial approach - some Ebola immunisation programmes involve mixing different jabs to improve protection, for example. And Mr Zahawi told BBC Breakfast that this has been done with other vaccines such as jabs for hepatitis, polio and measles, mumps and rubella. New vaccine 'ready by autumn' to tackle mutations The vaccines that work - and the others on the way Study showing vaccine slows virus spread 'superb' The Com-Cov study, run by the National Immunisation Schedule Evaluation Consortium, will involve more than 800 volunteers. The study will be recruiting,externalpeople aged 50 or older, who have not yet received a Covid vaccine, in London, Birmingham, Liverpool, Nottingham, Bristol, Oxford and Southampton. Some will receive the Oxford jab followed by the Pfizer vaccine or vice versa, four or 12 weeks apart. Other vaccines may be added as they are approved by regulators. The chief investigator, Prof Matthew Snape from the University of Oxford, said the ""tremendously exciting study"" would provide information vital for vaccine rollouts in the UK and globally. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that animal studies have shown ""a better antibody response with a mixed schedule rather than the straight schedule"" of vaccine doses. ""It will be really interesting to see if the different delivery methods actually could lead to an enhanced immune response [in humans],"" he said, ""or at least a response that's as good as giving the straight schedule of the same doses"". While this study was initially designed to provide greater flexibility for vaccine rollouts, there is the tantalising possibility that mixing vaccines could provide even better, longer-lasting protection. The Oxford vaccine, for example, uses a harmless virus - almost like a viral postman - to deliver the key part of the vaccine (the bit with coronavirus's genetic code) into the body. This bit of code helps train the body's immune system to recognise coronavirus and prepare defences to fight it off in the future. When a second dose of the same vaccine is given, there is some evidence to suggest that our immune systems can shift a bit of their focus onto the viral postman - rather than coronavirus itself. The hope is that by mixing up jabs, this will allow our immune systems to focus more fully on building up protection against coronavirus. Approaching the challenge using various vaccine combinations may strengthen results. Other countriesare conducting similar studies to monitor the impact of mixing vaccines. Scientists will monitor volunteers for side-effects and carry out blood tests to see how well their immune systems respond. Fact-checking President Macron's vaccine claim Trials to combine Oxford and Sputnik vaccines How many people have been vaccinated so far? The full study will continue for 13 months but scientists hope they will be able to announce some initial findings by June. The study will also provide data on: The impact of the vaccines on new variants The effects of second doses at four and 12 weeks This video can not be played WATCH: Pfizer v Oxford v Moderna â three Covid-19 vaccines compared England's deputy chief medical officer, Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, said there were ""definitive advantages"" to learning whether or not vaccine doses could be mixed, given the ""challenges"" of the vast number of people needing a jab and potential global supply constraints. He said combining vaccines could lead to better protection, ""giving even higher antibody levels that last longer"". Any changes to the UK's current strategy would need approval from the JCVI.

More than 10 million people in the UKhave received at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine. The government aims to offer first doses to 15 million people inthe top four priority groups, including everyone over 70 years old, by 15 February. Mr Zahawi said after that target has been met, a detailed timeline will be set out for the next set of priority groups, including people aged 50 to 69.

'NI Protocol won't be changed' - Coveney,"Graffiti has appeared in a number of areas showing opposition to the NI Protocol There has been a ""coming together of unionism"" in recent days to oppose the NI Protocol, Arlene Foster has said. On Tuesday, the DUPpublished a five-point planaimed at scrapping the NI part of the Brexit deal. It called for unity among unionist parties, who say the protocol damages trade and threatens the UK union. But Sinn FÃ©in has said the protocol must remain in place, insisting there would ""always be difficulties"" in implementing it. The protocol was designed to ensure an open border between NI and the Republic of Ireland. Instead there are checks on some products travelling from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, but unionists oppose this border up the Irish Sea. Speaking at a news conference on Thursday, Mrs Foster said the ""disappointment"" for her was that the EU had not acknowledged the protocol was causing disruption to trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. UK and EUleaders met on Wednesday night, following a move by the EU to trigger an emergency mechanism, known as Article 16, to override the protocol amid a row on vaccine exports. The EU later reversed the decision but faced widespread criticism for the move. Mrs Foster demanded action be taken by the British government to overturn the current protocol arrangements, and issued a direct message to unionists. ""Part of the difficulty in unionism is that sometimes when confronted with difficult circumstances they turn in on themselves, and start to look for lundys [traitors] they can blame for that,"" she added. ""But since the actions of the EU last Friday I have seen a coming together of unionism. ""My plea is not to turn in on ourselves."" What is the Northern Ireland Protocol? She said the government had ""sleepwalked"" into the protocol, and that it should be scrapped before then looking at the risks to the EU's single market. Mrs Foster said her party wanted people to respond in a calm way, adding: ""It's important to focus on constitutional politics."" Arlene Foster told The View the UK government recognised ""action was needed"" Speaking on BBC NI's The View on Thursday evening, the first minister said she believed there had been ""a shift in emphasis"" from the UK government ""since the actions of the European Union last Friday"". ""Since then we have seen the government respond to the difficulties of the protocol in a more meaningful way,"" she said. ""No longer are we hearing from government talk about teething problems, we're now hearing them talk about significant problems between Great Britain and Northern Ireland."" Mrs Foster added there was ""recognition in government"" that action is needed ""and it needs to be soon"". The finance minister, Sinn Fein's Conor Murphy, said parties had a responsibility to provide ""calm leadership"" and ensure businesses could be given advantages through the protocol. ""You can't change trading arrangements without difficulties. Not just unionists are suffering, everyone will in some ways but it can't all be attributed to the protocol,"" he said. Mr Murphy argued that some businesses had not prepared fully before the protocol took effect on 1 January, and criticised the British government for ""leaving it right to the wire"". Conor Murphy and Arlene Foster take opposing views on Brexit and the NI Protocol Earlier, the Republic of Ireland's foreign minister insisted that the protocol was ""not going to be changed. Simon Coveney said there were problems with implementation, but that the protocol contained ""flexibilities"". The UK government has asked the EU for temporary lighter enforcement of the rules to be extended until early 2023. But the European Commission's chief spokesman said grace periods were always meant to be of a ""temporary nature"" and were ""subject to strict conditions of their application"". Speaking at a daily press briefing, Eric Mamer said it was up to the joint committee involving the UK government and the EU to find a way forward. Discussions between the UK and EU on managing the protocol are due to continue next week. It follows the withdrawal of staff from NI ports afterthreats were issued. Simon Coveney said there were problems with implementation, but the protocol will not be changed On Thursday, Mr Coveney told BBC News NI there were some ""genuine concerns"" with the protocol, although his government wanted to be helpful in ensuring its implementation. ""The flexibilities that are already there for Northern Ireland are grace periods for certain elements of the protocol that don't need to be implemented straight away in Northern Ireland, for example supermarkets don't have to have health certifications in order to import products from GB,"" he outlined. ""We want the protocol to function in a way that works for everybody, north and south on the island of Ireland. ""We talk to and listen to businesses in Northern Ireland as well as south of the border and we want to work with them."" Mr Coveney said the row on Friday overwhether the EU would trigger Article 16, which allows an override of the protocol, created more tension. It will take a few months, he added, ""to make sure it can be implemented in full"". Meanwhile, government minister Lord True said Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove had made it clear to EU Vice-President Maros Sefcovic that their ""focus must be on making the Protocol work in the interest of people and businesses in Northern Ireland"". The comments were made during a debate in the House of Lords following an urgent question from Conservative peer Lord Caine. DUP deputy leader Lord Dodds said the problems around the protocol could only be fixed through ""renegotiation or action by the government"". Ulster Unionist peer Lord Empey accused the EU of using Northern Ireland as ""political football"" and asked what alternatives were being considered for negotiation by the government with the EU. Lord Caine called on the government to take ""robust measures"" if both sides fail to agree a solution which protects the Belfast Agreement and respects the integrity of the UK.

Introduced last year, the Â£20-a-week uplift is due to end in April. The introduction of the Â£20 boost had provided a buffer for single mum Rebecca. ""At least I had something coming in,"" she said. ""The Â£20 is mostly food for [my daughter] - I eat whatever I can."" Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey has hinted the government could be moving closer to extending the rise but says there is no decision yet.

A Scottish cancer charity says it is starting to see patients who were diagnosed late as a result of the country's first coronavirus lockdown. Cancer Support Scotland says these people will die sooner because cancer services were paused. Cancer services and diagnostic tests in Scotland are now are back up and running and the government has published acancer recovery plan,externalaimed at improving services and outcomes. Kerr Raeburn was a third of the way through his treatment for Hodgkin's Lymphoma when the March lockdown hit. He was able to choose to continue with his treatment and stem cell transplant and is now cancer-free. He says: ""I would be feeing quite despondent if I was told the treatment was cancelled. I just hope that people would eventually get their operations and hopefully not be put at too much risk of relapse and things coming back."" On World Cancer Day, you can read the full storyhere. French Prime Minister Jean Castex has said there are no plans for another national lockdown in the country, but warned the situation there remains fragile. âWe must stick with the current restrictions we already have
in place,â he told a news conference on Thursday. âBut the situation today does
not justify a new national lockdownâ. France currently has a 18:00 curfew in place in a bid to curb
the spread of the virus. Bars, restaurants, museums and gyms remain closed. All
non-essential travel to and from non-EU countries is banned. Castex reminded people that it was âimperativeâ to work
from home whenever possible and called on people to do everything they can do to avoid a third lockdown. UK residents travelling to England from certain ""high risk"" countries will soon have to quarantine in government-sanctioned hotels so the measure can be more strictly enforced. The rule will apply to areas associated with new coronavirus variants including South America, Portugal and many countries in Southern Africa. The BBC has been told the system will begin on 15 February (see ourprevious post). But which countries are on the banned list? Read morein our explainer. The system of managed hotel quarantine for UK residents arriving into England from ""red list"" countries will begin on 15 February, government sources have told the BBC. The BBC has seen a document that sets out the date and
estimates that hotels will be asked to provide accommodation for more than
1,000 people a day. Ministers are expected to confirm full details soon. They
had faced criticism from Labour for failing to implement the scheme,
more than a month after the South African variant was detected. Scotland's First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said earlier that the Scottish government's plans for managed quarantine would go further than those elsewhere in the UK. Read morehere. An NHS leader has warned against a fast relaxation of coronavirus measures, describing health workers as being ""at full stretch"". NHS Providers chief executive Chris Hopson said the health service's intensive care capacity was running at 170% of last year's, with an upcoming cold snap due to increase pressure further. In aseries of tweets,external, Hopson said NHS staff were ""deeply exhausted & fatigued having worked at fever pitch intensity for many weeks"". He added: ""The NHS has barely crested the peak and it's still at an extremely high altitude under huge pressure. The descent down the mountain has only just started and we don't know how steep the down slope will be. We also know that the descent will likely take months, not days/weeks. ""We saw last year what happened when we released restrictions on social contact too quickly. The impact of the vaccination will help significantly... over time. But to save lives and reduce patient harm, we need a cautious, evidence-based approach to relaxing the restrictions.""

The Harry Potter spin-off stars Eddie Redmayne Filming on the third Fantastic Beasts film has halted after a ""team member"" tested positive for coronavirus. The Harry Potter spin-off, which stars Eddie Redmayne and Jude Law, is being shot at Warner Brothers Studios in Leavesden, Hertfordshire. Warner Bros Pictures says the diagnosis came as a result of ""ongoing testing"" all those working on Fantastic Beasts 3 receive. It says production has ""paused"" and theemployee is in isolation. Yolande KnellBBC Middle East correspondent, Jerusalem The Hamas authorities in the Gaza Strip have fully lifted restrictions there after a significant drop in the number of coronavirus cases. Gazaâs seaside cafes, busy shopping centres, mosques and gyms will be fully reopened for the start of the local weekend for the first time in two months. Students will now be allowed to return to schools and universities full-time. Strict quarantine measures as well as Gazaâs relative isolation meant it didnât see its first public outbreak of coronavirus until August. There had been fears a serious Covid outbreak could overwhelm the weak healthcare system in the Palestinian Territory, which has long been under blockade by Israel and Egypt. A strict lockdown initially imposed in Gaza was later replaced by night-time curfews and weekend closures. Now Hamas officials â under pressure to reopen the economy - say the fall in numbers of new cases and those being treated in hospital mean restrictions are no longer needed. No Covid vaccines have yet been sent to Gaza. This video can not be played Covid in Scotland: Snow impact on vaccinations 'concerning' Earlier, Scotland's First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, admitted to concerns about the impact of poor weather conditions on the country's Covid vaccination programme. However, she said plans were in place to help protect the rollout of the jab during the wintry weather. The Met Office has issued an amber warning for ""heavy and persistent"" snow for much of the north of Scotland. The Highlands, Aberdeenshire, Tayside and Perthshire are expected to be the worst affected. More than 10 million first vaccine doses have now been given to people in the UK. The seven-day average for daily doses is currently 430,532. The number of patients in hospital with coronavirus remains high, with 31,670 people hospitalised as of 2 February. This is below the latest peak of hospitalisations seen last month. The number of daily coronavirus cases reported continues to fall, with the seven-day average now 21,246 new cases per day. The government is ""risking lives"" by being too slow to implement a hotel quarantine plan, Labour has claimed. Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced in January that UK residents returning from Covid hotspots would have to quarantine in hotels, but a timetable has not yet been set. Labour has written to Home Secretary Priti Patel to urge her to end the delays and get on with it. But ministers insist there is not a delay and they are working on the scheme ""at pace"" and an announcement will be made next week. Here's the full story. London Underground staff have been told to continue to work, despite a ""stay at home"" plea from the government over concerns with the South African Covid-19 variant. In an emailseen by the LDRS, Transport for London (TfL) told those who cannot work from home to continue working as normal and encouraged them to get a Covid test. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said it is ""critical"" thatpeople in areas singled out for enhanced testing for the South African variantstay at home - this includes parts of London. The RMT union, which represents Tube workers, has called TfLâs advice âtotally unacceptableâ. TfL insists it is still following Government and Public Health England advice and says it is regularly communicating with trade unions. ""We continue to follow our robust cleaning regime and social distancing measures to reduce the risk of infection in the workplace,"" a TfL spokesperson added.

Nathan Orme was jailed at Douglas Courthouse for six weeks A man whose friend visited his home during the Isle of Man's second coronavirus lockdown has been jailed. Nathan Orme, 28, told police the person who had been at his home to get a phone charger was part of his ""bubble"", despite no such rules existing on the island, Douglas Courthouse heard. He admitted to breaking the island's strict Covid-19 laws prohibiting indoor gatherings. Orme, of Anagh Coar Road in Douglas, was sentenced to six weeks in prison. Defence advocate Stephen Wood told the court Orme was a ""damaged man"" and had done ""nothing criminal"" other than meeting with his friend. Orme was previously fined Â£500 for breaking self-isolation rules in May last year after leaving his home following an argument with his girlfriend. Here's the full story. A medical centre received angry calls and one staff member was threatened after players at a nearby football club were given Covid vaccines. Chesterfield FC said some players and staff, ""most of them vulnerable"", were given jabs to stop them being wasted. However, the medical centre which gave the vaccines has received dozens of angry phone calls since news of the vaccinations appeared in the media. One threatened a female member of staff, saying he knew where she lived, prompting police to investigate. Read morehere. Philippa RoxbyHealth reporter, BBC News The number of people who have died within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test in the UK has risen by another 915 today. It means the death toll by this measure is now in excess of 110,000. But after weeks of mounting deaths since mid-December, there are positive signs deaths are finally reducing. In the past week, daily recorded deaths have been lower than every corresponding day in the previous week. And the last time the daily deaths figure was below 1,000 (apart from on a Sunday and Monday when the numbers are usually much lower because of delayed reporting after a weekend) was on 5 January. That was just as lockdown restrictions were being introduced and children were told not to return to school for the new term. Much has changed since then: Hospitals have been under intense pressure because of Covid-19 and millions of people have been vaccinated against the disease. Confirmed cases and hospital admissions have been falling â usually an early indication that the numbers dying will also follow. However, there are clear warnings from health officials that there should be no complacency. Vaccinating the most vulnerable will reduce deaths initially, but it will take many millions more vaccinations for all the over-50s and those with underlying conditions to really reduce the pressure on the countryâs hospitals.

people to show they have been inoculated. The countryâs health minister  Lena Hallengren said the certificate could be used as a passport to âtravel abroad on holiday or
meet a loved oneâ. The government is hoping to get the certificates ready by June. Digitalisation Minister Anders Ygeman said businesses
including restaurants could ask customers to prove they have been
vaccinated,The Local reports,external. Sweden has recorded more than 580,000 cases and 11,939 deaths. The move comes a day after Denmark announced a similar certificate. The
government there announced it would have an online registry that would be used
to check someoneâs vaccination status. This is a temporary measure until a
long-term solution is established. The World Health Organisation has considered the idea
of digital certificates in the past but said last month that it opposed them
being used as a requirement for travel. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Anger at university 'decolonised curriculum' plans,"The university also plans to cut a number of posts, putting 145 staff at risk of redundancy A university is facing growing anger over its plans to drop English language and medieval literature modules and introduce a ""decolonised curriculum"". The University of Leicester said it was considering cutting subjects after a ""drop in demand"", and instead focusing on ethnicity, sexuality and diversity. But the idea has been met with dismay by a number of academics and students. Since the plans were announced, some university staff have also received abusive messages online. Among those opposed to the changes is Professor Isobel Armstrong, a fellow of the British Academy, who has returned her honorary doctorate from the university in protest. The Leicester branch of the University and College Union (UCU) said Prof Armstrong made her decision ""in protest at the egregious attack on the integrity of English at Leicester and the attempt to eradicate 1,000+ years of language and literature from the curriculum"".

An examiner for the university's English Studies MA, Professor Catherine Clarke, has also resigned. Prof Clarke said: ""This [is] either a cynical exploitation of the language of 'decolonisation', or genuine (and appalling) ignorance of the work medieval and early modern subjects can contribute to this endeavour."" She urged the university to ""reconsider these proposals"" as they ""will diminish the experience of students at Leicester and limit their future opportunities"". In January, the University of Leicester announced a consultation over proposals across a number of departments. It also plans to cut 60 posts, putting 145 staff at risk of redundancy. Under the restructuring, the English department would no longer teach medieval literature due to ""a drop in demand from undergraduate and postgraduate students in recent years"". If adopted, the changes would also mean the university discontinuing BA English with English language, and MA English Language and Linguistics. The university said it planned to introduce ""a range of modules which are excitingly innovative"", focusing on subjects such as race, ethnicity, sexuality and diversity. Its spokeswoman said ""decolonising the curriculum"" meant ""reconsidering how the subject is taught ""to make it more inclusive and reflect emerging developments"". ""For example, many reading lists are dominated by white authors,"" she said. ""This ignores many great BAME scholars and also means that BAME students do not see themselves reflected in what they are being taught."" But she said the work was unconnected to the proposed redundancies and removal of courses. A total of 56% of last year's undergraduate students at the university classed themselves as BAME, the university added. Dr Shazia Jagot, who studied at the University of Leicester, said the changes could directly impact the education of students from black and minority ethnic (BAME) backgrounds. In an article for Times Higher Education,externalDr Jagot, who describes herself as working class and ""of South Asian heritage"", wrote: ""What happens when you remove the opportunity for students, particularly black and ethnic minority students, to read Beowulf, Chaucer and Milton? ""They are robbed of the chance to read texts foundational to the history of English literature and to engage in the rich, energetic work that is tackling racism, white supremacy and sexism in the discipline."" Final year student Rhiannon Jenkins disagrees ""decolonisation is synonymous with redundancies"" Final year English student Rhiannon Jenkins said: ""We want decolonisation, the student body does want decolonisation. ""But we disagree that decolonisation is synonymous with redundancies, and we disagree that it's synonymous with getting rid of medievalism and early modern English literature."" The 21-year-old, who is the course representative for final year English students, said: ""We think that [the university has] used this rhetoric of decolonisation to suggest that the English department haven't done any work towards it, and suggest that medievalism and early modern literature has no place for decolonisation in it."" Ms Jenkins also said the university would not allow the English department to poll first year students to find out what modules they were interested in. A University of Leicester spokesperson said: ""This is not the case - the university's module selection process for next year's English course has not yet commenced."" The English Association, an organisation devoted to studying and teaching the English language, is based at the university. It said it was ""shocked to hear of the proposed closure of English Language and Medieval Studies at the university"". Leicester academic David Clark, who shared an extract of the proposals on Twitter said he was ""bemused by the implication none of us already teaches/writes about... decolonising the curriculum.""

A university spokeswoman stressed English would still be offered as a course subject, and said: ""We will continue to offer a wide chronological range, covering hundreds of years of English literature - enabling students to experience the scope of literature they tell us they want to see in an English curriculum today."" But she said the university could not ""continue to offer modules that consistently attract small and ever-declining numbers"". ""We are now in an extensive, 90-day consultation period and are engaging closely with unions, staff, students and external stakeholders,"" she said. Since the plans were announced, the university said several staff had been harassed online. The spokeswoman added: ""Some staff have received abusive messages following some inaccurate reports in the media and we are providing the necessary support for them. ""We also had some staff receiving abuse for doing research in related areas."" Follow BBC East Midlands onFacebook,external, onTwitter,external, or onInstagram,external.

Taylor Swift sued by theme park over album name,"The singer's lawyers say ""there is no basis"" for the claim Taylor Swift is being sued by a US theme park called Evermore, which says the star's latest album has infringed its trademark by using the same name. The theme park's owners said Swift's Evermore release had caused confusion about whether the two were linked. The Utah venue said there was a ""dramatic departure from typical levels"" of traffic on its website in the week after the album's release. Swift's lawyers responded that ""there is no basis"" for the claim. They wrote in a letter filed in court: ""Moreover, your client has suffered no damages whatsoever and, in fact, has openly stated that Ms Swift's album release creates a 'marketing opportunity' for your client's troubled theme park."" Taylor Swift reveals second surprise album of 2020 Taylor Swift's Folklore is a record-breaker The letter added that the claim was ""frivolous and irresponsible"". But the theme park owners, who are seeking millions of dollars in damages, have said the trademark for the name belongs to them, and that Swift violated it when she started selling album-related merchandise. In the case, filed in a US District Court in Utah, the owners said they had spent millions of dollars on the attraction, which opened in 2018. In December, the owners wrote to Swift's legal team to say they were ""open to discussing reasonable terms for your discontinuation"" of the trademark. Evermore, which was released on 10 December, was Swift's second surprise album of 2020 and was described as a ""sister album"" to Folklore, which came out in July. Both albums were critical and commercial successes, topping charts around the world, includingin the UK,externaland the US. Follow us onFacebook,externalor on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external.

Footballer fined Â£200 for lockdown haircut,"Joelinton shared a picture of himself with Tom Baxter on Friday A footballer who broke lockdown restrictions to get a haircut has been fined Â£200. Newcastle United striker Joelinton, 24, the club's Â£40m record signing who joined in 2019, shared a picture of himself with barber Tom Baxter in the hairdresser's North Shields garage. The football club has been approached for comment. Mr Baxter had been warned before about possible breaches and has been given prohibition notices by two councils. He said he ""holds his hands up"" for cutting the hair of several footballers during the current lockdown which he ""shouldn't have done"", but he was trying to ""make ends meet"". ""I have done them all, they have all had hair dos, they just did not put it on social media,"" he said. He thought Joelinton's cut should be permitted because it was for a photo shoot and ""TV stars are allowed to get their hair and make up done"", he said. Hair salons and barbers in England are currently closed under lockdown regulations. Tom Baxter said he spent Â£20,000 making his Newcastle salon Covid secure Northumbria Police would not identify individuals but said it had ""spoken to the 24-year-old man who will be issued with a Â£200 fixed penalty notice under the Coronavirus legislation"". ""The local authority, who are responsible for enforcement in relation to businesses, have served a 35-year-old man with a prohibition notice,"" a spokesperson said. Newcastle City Council said it had issued Mr Baxter with a warning in November and a prohibition notice in January for his Newcastle salon. North Tyneside Council also issued a prohibition notice after complaints Mr Baxter was working from his garage, which is in the borough. Mr Baxter said his Newcastle salon was closed in November and reopened under tier three rules in December. Follow BBC North East & Cumbria onTwitter,external,Facebook,externalandInstagram,external.

Brits snap up Australian wine not going to China,"Sales of Australian wine to the UK have surged almost 30% in the last year as producers try to overcome crippling taxes on exports to China. Wine producers have ramped up exports to Europe to a 10-year high, with the UK now the number one destination. China increased taxes by a massive 212% in November following a trade spat with Australia which has also affected goods including lobsters and coal. Wine Australia said the UK sales surge was helped by lockdowns and Brexit. China puts up to 200% tariffs on Australian wine Why did China really go cold turkey on Australian wine? China's drinkers develop taste for home-grown wines The value of wine exports to Europe climbed 22% last year, while ""standout performer"" the UK saw shipments jump 29% according to government figures. Wine Australia, a government organisation set up to promote and regulate the wine industry, said demand increased at the start of the coronavirus pandemic and was boosted in the months leading up to Brexit. The sharp rise in sales to Europe helped offset a big slump in exports to China in the last two months of 2020. Wine exports to China fell just 1% in value last year, given that the high tariffs imposed by Beijing were only imposed in November. This video can not be played The Australian wine lessons bound for China For the first nine months of last year, China was the biggest destination for Australia's wine exports, accounting for 39%. The UK is now the biggest destination for Australian wine exports by volume, with Brits buying up 266 million litres (29.6 million cases) in 2020. The most popular varieties were shiraz/syrah which accounted for 29% of UK sales last year, followed by chardonnay (25%) and cabernet sauvignon (10%). ""Due to the Covid lockdown they are not drinking wines in restaurants and cafesâ¦ but instead buying retail.  Australian wines have sold extremely well in UK retail for decades,"" a Wine Australia spokesman told the BBC. China's tensions with Australia started out as a political spat that spilled over into trade. Officials in China have argued that some Australian wine is being sold cheaper there (dumped) than in its home market through the use of subsidies. Australia has rejected this claim. China's commerce ministry said the tariffs, ranging from 107% to 212%, were temporary anti-dumping measures while it carried out a year-long investigation. ""The Australian government categorically rejects any allegation that our wine producers are dumping product into China,"" Australia's agriculture minister David Littleproud said in November. ""Australian wine is hugely popular both in China and across the globe due to its high quality and we are confident that a full and thorough investigation will confirm this."" Wine merchants in the UK have warned that drinkers could pay more per bottle on many European wines while choosing from a reduced range as the burden of post-Brexit paperwork takes effect.

Police pressure as Covid 'changes crime landscape',"This video can not be played Police have been breaking up house parties and stopping people visiting beauty spots while dealing with increases in violent crime Unprecedented changes in lifestyle in the coronavirus pandemic led to an acceleration in shifts in criminal behaviour in Wales, a crime expert has said. Levels of reported crime fell across Wales from October 2019-2020, including in the first few months of the pandemic. But figures show reports of cyber crime, stalking and harassment spiked. Professor Martin Innes said challenges were ""unprecedented"" in modern times. The Cardiff University professor said while it was hard to predict the future, an increase in digital crime during the pandemic, teamed with the economic impact and increases in social tension mixed for a ""worrying cocktail"" for post-lockdown crime. Covid lockdown rule breakers could 'make pandemic longer' Policing Covid in Wales: 'Coughed at and spat on' Police forces across Wales have repeatedly warned of beingunder immense pressureduring the pandemic as they try to enforce Covid laws while dealing with serious and violent crime. Recent figures,released by the Office of National Statistics,external, show 245,591 crimes were reported to Welsh police forces between October 2019 and September 2020, a 7% fall on the year before, although this does not include fraud figures. The number of fraud offences increased by 8% to 14,845 during the same period. While the number of burglaries (-18%), thefts (-22%) and shoplifting offences fell between September 2019-2020, stalking and harassment reports increased by 11% in Wales, with 36,770 reports. Domestic abuse charities also reported markedincreases in calls for help when schools returned in Septemberafter abuse was not reported during lockdown. Prof Innes, director of the Crime and Security Research Institute at Cardiff University, said crime had been shifting for years, but lockdown had seemed to accelerated rates of personal and digital crime, as people were stuck at home and spending more time online. Dyfed-Powys Police saw the largest increase in reports of stalking and harassment offences, with 5,229 reports a 34% increase compared to the year before. In North Wales police reported an increase in stalking and harassment crimes, as well as a rise in disability and transphobic hate crime. This video can not be played A BBC investigation has found online scams selling fake protective equipment and coronavirus tests While the coronavirus pandemic has seen many acts of kindness, police have warned some criminals have used Covid-19 to scam people out of their life savings. Figures,published by Action Fraud,external, show victims of cyber crime and fraud in Wales have reportedly lost Â£35.4m, with almost 13,000 crimes reported since the start of lockdown on 23 March. Health officials and police have warned scammers claiming to work for the NHS are targeting vulnerable people online offering fake Covid vaccines in return for cash or personal details. Dyfed-Powys Police also reported asignificant increase in romance fraud, with victims in west Wales losing Â£1.3m between January and November last year, with officers saying criminals are targeting the lonely in lockdown. Prof Innes said that empty shops could become hot spots for anti-social behaviour when lockdown was eased Prof Innes said the shift to cyber, such as online hate crime, drug dealing over apps, and smear campaigns, was a huge challenge for forces and they would need to invest in expertise and technology to be able to recover evidence. He said the impact of the pandemic on drug trade, and gang operations like County Lines, was concerning, as criminal operations would have changed. ""Just like everybody else has changed their behaviour in the pandemic, those involved in drug behaviour have probably done the same... and probably some of those innovations they've made will stick."" At a recent North Wales Police and Crime panel Chief Constable Carl Foulkes said that officers were predicting an increase in ""digital cyber criminality"" and it would be a ""complex and challenging"" area for the future. This video can not be played ""He would push, shove and kick me out of bed"" South Wales Police and Crime Commissioner Alun Michael warned ""increased levels of serious violence and domestic abuse were likely to continue"" following the pandemic. In a report to theSouth Wales Police and Crime Panel, Mr Michael,externalsaid: ""The scale of the economic downturn and subsequent rate of recovery will fundamentally shape the post pandemic crime and disorder landscape in the medium to long term."" He added: ""People are spending more time online - increasing the risk of phishing, grooming, cyber attacks and sextortion. ""Payment preferences are also shifting to increasingly be online which again opens up opportunities for online fraud."" Meanwhile reports of public order offences also increased across all four forces by 8%, with Dyfed-Powys Police recording an increase of 29% during the year to September 2020. In Dyfed-Powys and Gwent Police areas, documents show the forces said crime had increased after lockdown measures were first eased in summer 2020. InGwent reports of sexual offences increased by 29%,external(from 128 to 126), but remained significantly lower than normal with the force saying less people were reporting the crime, while bike thefts increased by 25%, due to ""cycling being encouraged...during lockdown"". This video can not be played Covid lockdown rule breakers flee Cwmbran salon in police raid In theDyfed-Powys area drug offences increased during the first lockdown in March,external, before decreasing significantly later in 2020. The force warned that public tensions remained high due to Covid restrictions, and this had led to the number of reports of public order offences remaining high. There had been ""exponential"" increases in anti-social behaviour reports due to breaches of lockdown rules, it said. In July and August, when restrictions began to ease, there was a sharp rise in violent attacks, but the force said this was down to an ""increase in alcohol related"" incidents. In North Wales, by the start of December, officers had issued 582 fines for Covid-19 restriction breaches, with two Â£10k fines issued for illegal music events. This video can not be played The impact of Covid rule-breakers Prof Innes said when lockdown measures were eased again, anti-social behaviour and low level public disorder could spike in communities, and with people struggling due to losing their jobs, crime levels would return to pre-pandemic levels. ""People have been cooped up and there won't be an awful lot of things for people to do as the weather gets nicer,"" he said. ""We can already see some of the social tensions kind of bubbling away when you look across Europe. ""Longer term we are going to see a lot of empty shops and town centres are going to be very different than they have been... what we know is when you've got empty stores they act as a magnet for trouble.""

'UK economy to rebound strongly thanks to vaccine',"The UK's rapid Covid-19 vaccination programme will help the economy bounce back strongly this year, according to the Bank of England. The economy is expected to shrink 4.2% in the first three months of 2021, amid tighter lockdown restrictions to slow the spread of the virus. But policymakers expect a rebound this spring as consumer confidence returns. The Bank also told High Street lenders to prepare for negative interest rates, even as it ruled out an imminent move. What are negative interest rates? The UK economy is expected to ""recover rapidly"" in 2021, with a successful vaccination programme supporting a ""material recovery in household spending"". Andrew Bailey, the governor of the Bank of England, described the vaccine rollout as ""excellent news"" that would speed up a return to normal life. ""We do think that that is going to support a sustained recovery throughout the rest of the year,"" he said. What is the Budget and when will it happen? Firms 'in the dark' over post lockdown reopening How high could the unemployment rate go? Its latest Monetary Policy Report,externalsaid the positive vaccine news had driven an increase in UK holiday bookings later this year, although overseas bookings remained muted. While government support schemes are expected to limit any immediate increase in unemployment, the jobless rate is still projected to rise to 7.8% later this year as the furlough scheme winds down. The most recent unemployment rate -for September to November - was 5.0%, However, policymakers said the outlook for the economy remained ""unusually uncertain"". The Bank said the rebound in economic activity would depend on controlling any new strains of the virus, as well as households' willingness to spend. It said most people now expect ""life to return to normal"" within a year. But some voluntary social distancing was likely to persist, as it has done in economies where restrictions have already been eased substantially. In New Zealand, for example, spending on restaurants and hotels has still not recovered to pre-pandemic levels. The Bank said: ""The Covid vaccination programme would be expected to lead to an easing of social distancing restrictions, reduced economic uncertainty and higher activity, although the timing of those effects is hard to predict."" Millions of workers remain on thegovernment's furlough scheme, while redundancies increased sharply at the end of last year. However, many high earners working from home have saved more during the pandemic. The Bank said Â£125bn more was squirrelled away in UK savings accounts last year. The Bank said concerns about using public transport has pushed up demand for second-hand cars. ""That figure is likely to rise substantially further over the first half of 2021,"" the Bank said. Policymakers believe retired households, which have received vaccines sooner, will start spending first. Greater job security is also expected to lead to higher spending. However, the Bank noted that 70% of the people it surveyed planned to keep their extra money in savings instead of spending it. Sales of new cars are also expected to remain subdued, though concerns about using public transport have pushed up sales of second-hand vehicles. The Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) held interest rates at a record low of 0.1% on Thursday. Following a review, it has also asked High Street banks to get ready for the possibility that they could fall below zero in the future. The term ""interest rates"" is often used interchangeably with the Bank of England base rate. Described as the ""single most important interest rate in the UK"", the base rate determines how much interest the Bank of England pays to financial institutions that hold money with it, and what it charges them to borrow. High Street banks also use it to determine how much interest they pay to savers, as well as what they charge people who take out a loan or mortgage. The Bank of England usually lowers interest rates when it wants people to spend more and save less. In theory, taking interest rates below zero should have the same effect. But in practice, it's a bit more complicated. After all, why would anyone pay to stash money in a savings account or lend someone money, when they can keep the cash at home for free? The Bank stressed that commercial lenders needed at least six months to prepare and this did not mean that negative rates were ""imminent, or indeed in prospect at any time"". Mr Bailey added: ""My message to the markets is you really should not try to read the future behaviour of the MPC from these decisions and these actions we're taking on the toolbox. ""Nobody should take any signal from this."" Could you have to pay your bank to save money? Bank of England questions banks over negative rates The Bank of England is not just counting jobs and prices, but vaccinations too. On this basis, despite the current three months seeing a lockdown-inflicted fall in the economy, policymakers are more confident about the timing of recovery, in the middle of this year. Indeed, that recovery will be mathematically sharper than previously predicted, because of the further drop right now. As the Bank concludes in its forecast ""GDP picks up strongly"" as restrictions are assumed to ease between April and September. In terms of its decisions, that means the Bank has held fire, leaving interest rates at historic lows. Not one of the nine panel members deciding rates voted for the much-hyped ""negative rates"" seen in Europe. Commercial banks will be asked to prepare in the next months, so the lever is an option, but the Bank of England was at pains to say this was not a signal of intentions. The Bank was also clear that the post-Brexit trading rules will hit the economy, and that there are new ""barriers"" likely to lower trade between the UK and EU, some which are yet to emerge. This goes beyond the government's repeated claims that such changes are ""teething problems"". The big message, though, is a more confident assertion that the economy, as well as the people, will be inoculated by the summer.

Compass apologises after school meals 'fell short',"The company behind the controversial free school meals that sparked an outcry in January has apologised again. ""The quality and quantity of some food parcels fell short of our usual high standards,"" said Compass, which owns Chartwells, the school meal supplier. The meals led to a row when one mum posted a picture of them on Twitter. Compass investigated the meals and said it had now ""taken several corrective measures"". They include improved supply chain processes, additional guidance and resources for workers, and stronger quality assurance checks. Chartwells has also been providing breakfasts to all children currently receiving a lunch parcel from it since 25 January. ""We will also provide those same children with lunch and breakfast parcels through the February half term break,"" Compass said, with the firm promising to cover the costs of doing so. Food parcels are currently being sent to school children in England who would normally get free school meals. In January, one mother calling herself Roadside Mum posted a photo on Twitter of the free school meal that had been supplied to her and was supposedly worth Â£30. It consisted of two carrots, two potatoes and a tin of baked beans and a small range of other food items: she calculated the cost to be only about Â£5. School meal parcel 'an insult' School food firm apologises after Rashford intervenes The outcry led to an urgent investigation by the government after footballer Marcus Rashford said the food parcels were ""just not good enough"" and food poverty campaigner Jack Monroe accused the company of providing a ""poverty picnic"". Chartwells acknowledged the food was insufficient. In a statement at the time it said: ""In our efforts to provide thousands of food parcels a week, at extremely short notice, we are very sorry the quantity has fallen short in this instance."" In its latest trading update, Compass said: ""We have apologised to everyone who has been affected."" Compass reported improved figures for the last three months with its operating margin climbing to 2.7% to the end of December compared to 0.6% in the previous three months. It put that down to ""a series of actions we have taken over the last year to adapt our operations and to manage our cost base more flexibly, including contract renegotiations and resizing of the business"". However, it said the group's organic revenue for the three months to 31 December 2020 was down 33.7%, which was ""in line with our expectations, given the protracted lockdown measures to contain the virus during the winter months"". It warned that ""although the news around vaccinations is encouraging, the pace of volume recovery remains uncertain"". But looking ahead it said it expected ""a return to organic revenue growth, continued margin improvement and returns to shareholders over time"". Sophie Lund-Yates, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ""From an investment perspective, this [school meals] chapter has been an unwelcome addition to what is a torrid time for Compass, and won't have done the company's reputation any favours."" Contract catering is an incredibly tough place to be when the world shuts down, she pointed out. Volumes are barely edging forwards, meaning the bottom line is being protected through cost cutting. ""That's prudent business sense, but isn't a long-term solution. If it takes too long for stadiums and schools to fill back up, Compass will struggle to pump margins up any time soon.""

Shell sees huge loss as pandemic hits oil demand,"Oil giant Royal Dutch Shell sank to a net loss of $21.7bn (Â£16bn) last year after the coronavirus pandemic caused demand to slump. The announcement comes after two of its rivals, BP and Exxon, posted similar big losses. Looking ahead, Shell said ""significant uncertainty"" would continue to have a negative impact on demand for oil and gas products. As a result, it said it might need to take measures to cut production. In September last year, Shell announced thatup to 9,000 jobs would go worldwideas the company responded to the effects of the pandemic. Last month, it saidit was cutting 330 jobsfrom its operations in the North Sea. Even before the virus struck, the oil industry was already having to rethink its future plans as part of the transition away from fossil fuels. The Covid impact means companies such as Shell are accelerating that transition. Some doom-mongers were anticipating Royal Dutch Shell might unveil the largest-ever UK corporate loss, but in the end, the Anglo-Dutch oil group managed to get only halfway there. The Â£16bn deficit is dwarfed by the Â£30bn loss posted by Royal Bank of Scotland at the height of the 2008 banking crisis. The Shell results will also quickly be forgotten. They are largely accounting rather than cash losses, the result of a giant write-down in the future value of the company's oil fields and prospects. Already investors are turning their attention to next week, when chief executive Ben van Beurden will present the company's long-awaited plans to shift the company towards greener forms of energy. Pension funds and other big investors are pushing hard to get Shell to do more. The same pension funds, however, are reliant on the big stream of dividends that flows from the oil business. They will be hoping that Mr van Beurden will be able to pull off the trick of using that income to fund the investments in green energy that will - hopefully - yield a similar juicy dividend income in the future. Other big oil companies are also feeling the strain. On Tuesday, BP reported that it lost $18.1bn in 2020, marking its first annual loss in a decade. On the same day,US giant Exxon Mobilposted annual losses of $22.4bn. Two other big US firms, Chevron and ConocoPhillips, reported big losses as well. There are also indications of a potential shake-up in the sector, after media reports emerged this week that Exxon and Chevron held preliminary talks last year on a possible merger. The two firms declined to comment, but sources told Reuters that the discussions involved Exxon chief executive Darren Woods and his counterpart at Chevron, Mike Wirth. ""This week's huge losses by Shell, BP and Exxon reflect the challenges oil and gas companies face,"" said David Elmes, professor of practice and head of the Global Energy Research Network at Warwick Business School. ""They are skating on ever-thinning ice as the effects of climate change combine with other events like the Covid-19 pandemic."" Prof Elmes said the slump in demand for oil and gas due to the pandemic had become more prolonged than initially hoped. ""There will be some ongoing need for oil and gas as a fuel for a while yet. There will also be demand for the petrochemicals and other products made from them. But that can't sustain the industry we've seen in the past as we look to address climate change.""

Footballer fined Â£200 for lockdown haircutNewcastle United striker Joelinton shared a picture of himself with stylist Tom Baxter.Tyne & Wear,"Joelinton shared a picture of himself with Tom Baxter on Friday A footballer who broke lockdown restrictions to get a haircut has been fined Â£200. Newcastle United striker Joelinton, 24, the club's Â£40m record signing who joined in 2019, shared a picture of himself with barber Tom Baxter in the hairdresser's North Shields garage. The football club has been approached for comment. Mr Baxter had been warned before about possible breaches and has been given prohibition notices by two councils. He said he ""holds his hands up"" for cutting the hair of several footballers during the current lockdown which he ""shouldn't have done"", but he was trying to ""make ends meet"". ""I have done them all, they have all had hair dos, they just did not put it on social media,"" he said. He thought Joelinton's cut should be permitted because it was for a photo shoot and ""TV stars are allowed to get their hair and make up done"", he said. Hair salons and barbers in England are currently closed under lockdown regulations. Tom Baxter said he spent Â£20,000 making his Newcastle salon Covid secure Northumbria Police would not identify individuals but said it had ""spoken to the 24-year-old man who will be issued with a Â£200 fixed penalty notice under the Coronavirus legislation"". ""The local authority, who are responsible for enforcement in relation to businesses, have served a 35-year-old man with a prohibition notice,"" a spokesperson said. Newcastle City Council said it had issued Mr Baxter with a warning in November and a prohibition notice in January for his Newcastle salon. North Tyneside Council also issued a prohibition notice after complaints Mr Baxter was working from his garage, which is in the borough. Mr Baxter said his Newcastle salon was closed in November and reopened under tier three rules in December. Follow BBC North East & Cumbria onTwitter,external,Facebook,externalandInstagram,external.

Law change to allow maternity leave for ministerAttorney General Suella Braverman is expecting a baby - but under current rules she would have to resign.UK Politics,"The government is to update the law so that the attorney general can take six months' maternity leave. Suella Braverman, the government's chief law officer, announced in November she was expecting her second child ""early next year"". She would be one of the most senior government ministers to give birth in office. Under current laws, she would have to resign if she wanted to take time off following the birth. The government has announced a new law to formalise the process for ministerial maternity leave, which until now has been at the discretion of the prime minister. TheMinisterial and other Maternity Allowances Bill,externalwill allow cabinet ministers to receive up to six months' leave on full pay. At the moment, legislation from the 1970s means the prime minister does not normally have the flexibility to pay a cabinet minister maternity leave alongside paying a salary to their temporary replacement. New mothers 'need better job protection' 'Locum MP' to cover Stella Creasy maternity The bill would allow Ms Braverman and other cabinet ministers to take six months' leave on full pay - similar to more junior government roles and the civil service. Several female politicians serving as junior ministers have taken maternity leave in the past, including Conservative MPs Tracey Crouch and Kemi Badenoch. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said his party would back the bill, adding the change ""should have been brought in a long time ago"". The party's shadow cabinet office minister, Rachel Reeves, said the measures were a ""small but significant step forward"" but the government needed to go further and make provision for paternity, adoption and shared parental leave. Introducing the new measuresin a written statement,,externalthe prime minister said: ""The choice between taking leave to recover from childbirth and care for a new-born child or resigning from office is not acceptable in modern times."" Boris Johnson acknowledged that provisions needed to be made for leave for adoption, sickness and other circumstances. Ministers aren't subject to normal employee rights because they're appointed, and fired, by the prime minister. Many will be surprised to learn that Suella Braverman will become the first cabinet minister to take paid maternity leave. It's a generous scheme which will grant six months of full pay - under current rules, she would have had to resign or be demoted to qualify. The bill is being rushed through Parliament because she's due to give birth soon, but Labour wants to revisit the issue later to include paternity leave. The years of muddling through on an informal basis will end next Thursday. Ms Braverman, the Conservative MP for Fareham, became the second-ever woman to be appointed attorney general for England and Wales in February 2020. She had previously served as a junior Brexit minister under Theresa May, beforeresigning in November 2018in protest at the former PM's Brexit plans. She went on to take maternity leave whilst serving as a backbench MP after the birth of her first child in July 2019, with a ""proxy MP"" taking part in parliamentary debates and votes on her behalf. Labour's Tulip Siddiq delayed a caesarean section to take part in a vote All MPs are paid in full while on maternity, paternity or adoption leave. But not all their duties in Parliament are covered during their absence: Conservative MP Tracey Crouch,externalwas the first Conservative minister to take maternity leave in 2016.  She said she had been unsure about accepting the job of sports minister because she wanted to start family Chloe Smithinterrupted her maternity leave in 2017 to take part in a vote - becoming the first Conservative MP to bring their baby in to the Commons chamber In 2019, Labour MPTulip Siddiqwent against the advice of her doctors and delayed a planned caesarean section so she could take part in a crucial Brexit vote Labour'sStella Creasywas given permission to appoint a ""locum MP"" to cover her maternity leave in 2019 Father-of-three Conservative MPBim Afolami,externalwas the first dad able to vote by proxy when he took paternity leave Responding to the change, Ms Creasy said: ""In no other workplace would guaranteed paid maternity leave and cover be only the preserve of the management. ""The introduction of cover for ministers is long overdue, and this legislation reveals the lie I was told when I asked for maternity cover that MPs employment status made it impossible."" Ms Creasy added: ""What message does it send to the thousands of pregnant women facing redundancy and job insecurity in the pandemic or any of those considering entering public life at any level, if parliament treats maternity leave as a bonus like a company car to be given only to those at the top?"" Women are entitled to up to 52 weeks' maternity leave They must take at least two weeks' leave after the baby is born (or four weeks if they work in a factory) They are eligible to be paid for six weeks at 90% of their average weekly earnings and 33 weeks at Â£151 per week or 90% of their average weekly earnings (if lower) Fathers can take two weeks' statutory paternity leave at up to Â£151 a week Some couples are also entitled to shared parental leave of up to 50 weeks and 37 weeks of pay Should parental leave be extended due to coronavirus?

UK and EU in 'constructive' talks on NI trade row,"Brexit-related checks on products from Great Britain were suspended after threats against port staff The government and the EU have vowed to ""work intensively"" to quell tensions over post-Brexit checks at Northern Ireland ports. In a joint statement, both sides said talks on Wednesday with Northern Ireland leaders were ""constructive"". The talks were arranged after checks at some ports were suspended following ""sinister"" threats made to staff. UK and EU leaders say they condemn ""unreservedly"" any threats or intimidation. DUP urges PM to 'be unionist we need' over Brexit PM urges EU action to ease Brexit tensions in NI What is the Northern Ireland Protocol? Virtual talks between the Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove, his EU counterpart, Vice-President Maros Å efÄoviÄ and Northern Ireland's leaders were held on Wednesday amid an escalating row over applying new trade rules for Northern Ireland. The dispute has arisen because, under the Brexit agreement with the EU, some products entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain must be checked on entry. That is because unlike the rest of the UK, Northern Ireland has remained in the single market for goods. As a result, some food supplies and online shopping deliveries from Great Britain to Northern Ireland have been subject to delays and staff carrying out inspections have reported threats. Tensions were also heightenedwhen the EU threatenedemergency controls of Covid vaccine exports on the Irish border - a move the bloc later withdrew. In a joint statement, Mr Gove and Mr Å efÄoviÄ said they would ""work intensively to find solutions to outstanding issues"". The UK government and EU Commission reiterated their full commitment to the Good Friday Agreement, and to the ""proper implementation"" of the Northern Ireland protocol. Both leaders said they condemned unreservedly any threats or intimidation, and stressed that ""the safety and welfare of the people of Northern Ireland"" would always be the ""utmost priority."" The BBC's political editor, Laura Kuenssberg, says sources told her ""there wasn't much progress"" but both sides have agreed to keep talking. The source added that the EU wasn't in ""sackcloth and ashes"" after it temporarily suspended agreements made as part of the Brexit deal last Friday. The UK government has called for temporary lighter enforcement of the rules to be extended until early 2023. However writing in the Daily Telegraph,,externalNorthern Ireland's First Minister and DUP leader Arlene Foster warned that simply extending grace periods for businesses would not solve the problem. She said the Northern Ireland Protocol - the arrangements for the Irish border - ""cannot work"" and must be replaced. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill, from Sinn Fein, called for calm heads and welcomed Mr Å efÄoviÄ's intended visit to the UK next week for further talks, saying it was a ""very pragmatic and very constructive way"" to move forward. Part of the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement, the NI protocol guarantees an open border between the EU and Northern Ireland, with no controls on exported products. It was introduced to avoid creating a hard border on the island of Ireland. Instead there are checks on some products travelling from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. This is because Northern Ireland in effect remains part of the EU single market for goods while the rest of the UK has left. However, Article 16 of the protocol part of the deal allows the EU and UK to choose to suspend any aspects they consider are causing ""economic, societal or environmental difficulties"". The EU announced it would trigger the clause to control exports of vaccines to Northern Ireland, but laterreversed the decision. Unionist parties in NI have been pressing the UK government to use Article 16 to reduce checks on goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain.

US country star dropped by label over racial slur,"Wallen was named best new artist at the 2020 Country Music Association Awards US country star Morgan Wallen has been dropped by his record label, after a video emerged of him using a racial slur. Nashville's Big Loud Records said it had ""made the decision to suspend Morgan Wallen's recording contract indefinitely"" in light of the video. In the footage, reportedly filmed by a neighbour last weekend, the 27-year-old is seen saying goodbye to some friends and calling one of them the N-word. He has apologised for the incident. ""I'm embarrassed and sorry,""he told TMZ,external, which first published the footage. ""I used an unacceptable and inappropriate racial slur that I wish I could take back. There are no excuses to use this type of language, ever. I want to sincerely apologise for using the word. I promise to do better."" Wallen, whose career began on the US version of TV talent show The Voice, is currently one of the biggest country stars in the US. His latest record, Dangerous: The Double Album, has been number one on the Billboard chart for the last three weeks; and his last four singles have reached number one on the country airplay chart. Radio stations drop country star over racial slur The troubled history of the N-word However, the industry's response to his use of a racial slur has been swift and decisive. Within 24 hours of TMZ publishing its video, Wallen's music was pulled from the airwaves by iHeartMedia, the largest radio station group in the US, which owns more than 850 stations, including 135 country music stations. Other major networks, including Cumulus Media and Entercom, have also removed his music from their playlists. ""In light of Morgan Wallen's recent actions involving the use of a racial slur, we have made the decision to remove his music and content from our stations effective immediately,"" said a spokesman for iHeart. Broadcaster Country Music Television also distanced itself from the star. ""After learning of Morgan Wallen's racial slur late last night, we are in the process of removing his appearances from all our platforms,"" said the company in a statement. ""We do not tolerate or condone words and actions that are in direct opposition to our core values that celebrate diversity, equity and inclusion."" And the Academy of Country Music said it was revoking Wallen's ""potential involvement and eligibility"" for this year's ACM Awards. ""As a result of this unprecedented situation, the Academy will be reviewing our awards eligibility and submission process, ensuring our nominees consistently reflect the Academy's integrity,"" it said in a statement. This video can not be played Does country music recognise its roots? Wallen's songs also appear to have been removed from Spotify's Hot Country Songs playlist and Apple Music's equivalent, Today's Country. Those moves are particularly significant because, unusually for a country album, Dangerous has been a smash on streaming services. According to MRC Data, which compiles the US charts, 88% of its consumption has been online. Big Loud Records said its decision to drop the star had been supported by Republic Records, a division of Universal Music, with which it partners to release Wallen's records.

Myanmar blocks Facebook for sake of 'stability',"This video can not be played 'Dark old days': What young Burmese fear about the Myanmar coup Myanmar's military rulers have blocked access to Facebook, days after they overthrew the democratic government. Officials said the social media platform - for many in Myanmar the main source of online information - would be blocked for the sake of ""stability"". Facebook has become a key rallying point for opposition to Monday's coup. In further civil disobedience, lawmakers are refusing to leave their compound in the capital, and more pot-banging was seen in Yangon. The coup, led by armed forces chief Min Aung Hlaing, installed an 11-member junta, ending a short period of majority civilian rule. The military said an election in November had been fraudulent - though the country's election commission said there was no evidence to back up such claims. The elected civilian leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, along with President Win Myint, were detained and on Wednesday police filed charges against them. How Facebook became Myanmar's 'digital tea shop' Myanmar coup: What is happening and why? Growing up under Myanmar's military rule The general who returned Myanmar to military rule The charges against her include possession of unlawful communication devices - walkie-talkies used by her security staff. President Myint is accused of breaching Covid rules while campaigning for last November's election, which was won decisively by Ms Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD). The Ministry of Communications and Information said access to Facebook would be blocked until 7 February. However, it was still reported to be accessible sporadically. Anthony Aung, who runs a tour agency in Yangon, the main city, told the BBC at one point he still had access to the site through wifi but not cellular data. He said ""people around me are all rushing to download alternative apps and VPN"" - virtual private networks, which allow users to get round internet restrictions. Hours later, Mr Aung said Facebook had stopped working completely. Yangon student Min Htet said her education had already been suspended due to the Covid pandemic. ""Blocking Facebook today means that the freedom of young people is restricted from now on,"" she told Reuters.

Facebook became popular in Myanmar - also known as Burma - as the company initially allowed its app to be used without data costs so that consumers could avoid paying expensive telecoms charges. The social media giant acknowledged the disruption, saying ""we urge authorities to restore connectivity so that people in Myanmar can communicate with their families and friends and access important information"". Telecoms company Telenor Myanmar, which is part of the Norwegian Telenor Group, said it would comply with the order to block Facebook, but suggested in a statement that this breached human rights law. A small protest has taken place in front of a university in Myanmar's second city, Mandalay, with reports of four arrests. In Yangon, residents banged cooking pots for a second night running. A woman in the city told the BBC: ""We bang drums as we want the military government and the world to know that we don't agree with this military coup... I want our leader Aung San Suu Kyi back."" More protesters took to the streets in Yangon At least 70 lawmakers with the NLD are refusing to leave a government guest house in the capital, Nay Pyi Taw, and have declared what they are calling a new parliamentary session, BBC Burmese reports. The lawmakers are among hundreds who were confined by the military to guest houses before being told they were free to leave. The streets are for the most part calm with no sign of major protest and a night-time curfew in force. However, hospitals have seen protests. Many medics have either stopped work, or continued while wearing symbols of defiance. But a rally by thousands in support of the military, known as the Tatmadaw, took place in Nay Pyi Taw. Some waved banners saying ""Tatmadaw that loves people"". A rally took place in support of the military regime in the capital, Nay Pyi Taw UN Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres has meanwhile called for constitutional order to be re-established in Myanmar. ""It's absolutely unacceptable to reverse the result of the elections and the will of the people,"" he said. The Security Council adopted a resolution expressing ""deep concern"" and calling for the immediate release of Aung San Suu Kyi. ""The members of the Security Council emphasized the need for the continued support of the democratic transition in Myanmar,"" the 15-member council said in a statement agreed by consensus. On Wednesday, the council failed to agree on a statement condemning the coup, after it was blocked by China, which - as one of five permanent members - has a veto. How the military disrupted Myanmar's internet Myanmar coup: 'Our world turned upside down' Fitness coach films video as Myanmar coup unfolds Department of Agriculture works wearing red ribbons in protest Beijing has long played a role of protecting Myanmar from international scrutiny, and has warned since the coup that sanctions or international pressure would only make things worse. Alongside Russia, it has repeatedly shielded Myanmar from criticism at the UN over the military crackdown on the Muslim minority Rohingya population. Myanmar is a country of 54 million people in South East Asia which shares borders with Bangladesh, India, China, Thailand and Laos. It was ruled by an oppressive military government from 1962 to 2011, leading to international condemnation and sanctions. Aung San Suu Kyi spent years campaigning for democratic reforms. A gradual liberalisation began in 2010, though the military still retained considerable influence. A government led by Ms Suu Kyi came to power after free elections in 2015. But a deadly military crackdown two years later on Rohingya Muslims sent hundreds of thousands fleeing to Bangladesh and triggered a rift between Ms Suu Kyi and the international community. She has remained popular at home and her party won again by a landslide in the November 2020 election. But the military have now stepped in to take control once more.

Premier League stadium among latest vaccine sites,"A hospitality lounge in the main stand has been converted into a vaccination centre Crystal Palace fans missing their home ground in lockdown can now book a visit - but only if they are eligible for the coronavirus vaccine. The Premier League ground Selhurst Park is one of 39 large vaccination sites that opened this week - including theatres and a fire station. There are now 1,500 vaccine centres, including smaller sites, in England. More than 10 million people had received a first dose by Wednesday, 57 days after vaccination began. The NHS is using the Glaziers Lounge in Selhurst Park's main stand - used in the times before the pandemic for pre-match drinks and hired out for functions - to deliver vaccinations to people living in and around south-east London. At a recent post-match news conference, veteran manager Roy Hodgson - himself in the age group currently eligible for vaccinations - said he was pleased the club had ""stepped forward and shown how much we care"" by offering up part of the stadium to the NHS. Covid trial to examine mixing different vaccines When will I get a Covid vaccine? How many people have been vaccinated so far? It is not the only sports stadium to be included in the latest batch of vaccination centres, with jabs also being delivered at Colchester FC's Jobserve Community Stadium, the Twickenham Stoop stadium - home to the Harlequins rugby union team - and the John Smith's Stadium in Huddersfield. At Basingstoke Fire Station, firefighters will also help out with the vaccination programme when they are not responding to emergencies. NHS England said it is now delivering vaccinations at 90 large-scale sites, 192 High Street pharmacies, more than 1,000 GP-led centres and more than 250 ""hospital hubs"". VACCINE:When will I get the jab? NEW VARIANTS:How worried should we be? COVID IMMUNITY:Can you catch it twice? LOCKDOWN TIPS:Five ways to stay positive Prof Stephen Powis, NHS England's national medical director, said: ""I've seen first-hand what getting vaccinated means to those who are jabbed, their families and loved ones, and as more supply becomes available, we are able to expand the scale of this huge programme."" Theatres such as the Cliffs Pavilion in Southend and the Corn Exchange Theatre in Kings Lynn are also among the new mass vaccination centres. The UK has used a wide range of locations for its vaccine rollout, with people able to get immunised at such disparate venues as Salisbury Cathedral, Blackpool Winter Gardens and a disused Debenhams department store in Folkestone, Kent. Meanwhile, the UK is conducting a trial to see if givingdifferent vaccines for the first and second dose could work as well- or even better - than two doses of the same type.

US country star dropped by label over racial slurMorgan Wallen's music has also been removed by hundreds of US radio stations over the scandal.Entertainment & Arts,"Wallen was named best new artist at the 2020 Country Music Association Awards US country star Morgan Wallen has been dropped by his record label, after a video emerged of him using a racial slur. Nashville's Big Loud Records said it had ""made the decision to suspend Morgan Wallen's recording contract indefinitely"" in light of the video. In the footage, reportedly filmed by a neighbour last weekend, the 27-year-old is seen saying goodbye to some friends and calling one of them the N-word. He has apologised for the incident. ""I'm embarrassed and sorry,""he told TMZ,external, which first published the footage. ""I used an unacceptable and inappropriate racial slur that I wish I could take back. There are no excuses to use this type of language, ever. I want to sincerely apologise for using the word. I promise to do better."" Wallen, whose career began on the US version of TV talent show The Voice, is currently one of the biggest country stars in the US. His latest record, Dangerous: The Double Album, has been number one on the Billboard chart for the last three weeks; and his last four singles have reached number one on the country airplay chart. Radio stations drop country star over racial slur The troubled history of the N-word However, the industry's response to his use of a racial slur has been swift and decisive. Within 24 hours of TMZ publishing its video, Wallen's music was pulled from the airwaves by iHeartMedia, the largest radio station group in the US, which owns more than 850 stations, including 135 country music stations. Other major networks, including Cumulus Media and Entercom, have also removed his music from their playlists. ""In light of Morgan Wallen's recent actions involving the use of a racial slur, we have made the decision to remove his music and content from our stations effective immediately,"" said a spokesman for iHeart. Broadcaster Country Music Television also distanced itself from the star. ""After learning of Morgan Wallen's racial slur late last night, we are in the process of removing his appearances from all our platforms,"" said the company in a statement. ""We do not tolerate or condone words and actions that are in direct opposition to our core values that celebrate diversity, equity and inclusion."" And the Academy of Country Music said it was revoking Wallen's ""potential involvement and eligibility"" for this year's ACM Awards. ""As a result of this unprecedented situation, the Academy will be reviewing our awards eligibility and submission process, ensuring our nominees consistently reflect the Academy's integrity,"" it said in a statement. This video can not be played Does country music recognise its roots? Wallen's songs also appear to have been removed from Spotify's Hot Country Songs playlist and Apple Music's equivalent, Today's Country. Those moves are particularly significant because, unusually for a country album, Dangerous has been a smash on streaming services. According to MRC Data, which compiles the US charts, 88% of its consumption has been online. Big Loud Records said its decision to drop the star had been supported by Republic Records, a division of Universal Music, with which it partners to release Wallen's records.

Thanks for joining us. The live page writers today were: Hamish Mackay, Jennifer Meierhans, George Bowden, Sophie Williams and Alice Cuddy. The editors were James Clarke and Alex Therrien. We are going to be bringing our live page to a close soon, but before we do here's a look at some of the day's main coronavirus developments:  ""Obviously we will find a way to survive, because we have to, but it's a lot, lot harder,"" said single mum, Rebecca Failing to extend a Â£20 lockdown benefit boost will harm the health of millions of people for decades, leading health organisations have told Prime Minister Boris Johnson in a letter. Introduced last year, the Â£20-a-week uplift is due to end in April. The introduction of the Â£20 boost had provided a buffer for single mum Rebecca. ""At least I had something coming in,"" she said. ""The Â£20 is mostly food for [my daughter] - I eat whatever I can."" Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey has hinted the government could be moving closer to extending the rise but says there is no decision yet. Read more from the BBC's Michael Buchanan and Judith Burnshere. A Scottish cancer charity says it is starting to see patients who were diagnosed late as a result of the country's first coronavirus lockdown. Cancer Support Scotland says these people will die sooner because cancer services were paused. Cancer services and diagnostic tests in Scotland are now are back up and running and the government has published acancer recovery plan,externalaimed at improving services and outcomes. Kerr Raeburn was a third of the way through his treatment for Hodgkin's Lymphoma when the March lockdown hit. He was able to choose to continue with his treatment and stem cell transplant and is now cancer-free. He says: ""I would be feeing quite despondent if I was told the treatment was cancelled. I just hope that people would eventually get their operations and hopefully not be put at too much risk of relapse and things coming back."" On World Cancer Day, you can read the full storyhere. French Prime Minister Jean Castex has said there are no plans for another national lockdown in the country, but warned the situation there remains fragile. âWe must stick with the current restrictions we already have
in place,â he told a news conference on Thursday. âBut the situation today does
not justify a new national lockdownâ. France currently has a 18:00 curfew in place in a bid to curb
the spread of the virus. Bars, restaurants, museums and gyms remain closed. All
non-essential travel to and from non-EU countries is banned. Castex reminded people that it was âimperativeâ to work
from home whenever possible and called on people to do everything they can do to avoid a third lockdown. UK residents travelling to England from certain ""high risk"" countries will soon have to quarantine in government-sanctioned hotels so the measure can be more strictly enforced. The rule will apply to areas associated with new coronavirus variants including South America, Portugal and many countries in Southern Africa. The BBC has been told the system will begin on 15 February (see ourprevious post). But which countries are on the banned list? Read morein our explainer. The system of managed hotel quarantine for UK residents arriving into England from ""red list"" countries will begin on 15 February, government sources have told the BBC. The BBC has seen a document that sets out the date and
estimates that hotels will be asked to provide accommodation for more than
1,000 people a day. Ministers are expected to confirm full details soon. They
had faced criticism from Labour for failing to implement the scheme,
more than a month after the South African variant was detected. Scotland's First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said earlier that the Scottish government's plans for managed quarantine would go further than those elsewhere in the UK. Read morehere. An NHS leader has warned against a fast relaxation of coronavirus measures, describing health workers as being ""at full stretch"". NHS Providers chief executive Chris Hopson said the health service's intensive care capacity was running at 170% of last year's, with an upcoming cold snap due to increase pressure further. In aseries of tweets,external, Hopson said NHS staff were ""deeply exhausted & fatigued having worked at fever pitch intensity for many weeks"". He added: ""The NHS has barely crested the peak and it's still at an extremely high altitude under huge pressure. The descent down the mountain has only just started and we don't know how steep the down slope will be. We also know that the descent will likely take months, not days/weeks. ""We saw last year what happened when we released restrictions on social contact too quickly. The impact of the vaccination will help significantly... over time. But to save lives and reduce patient harm, we need a cautious, evidence-based approach to relaxing the restrictions."" NHS Providers is a membership organisation that represents health service and ambulance NHS trusts. The Harry Potter spin-off stars Eddie Redmayne Filming on the third Fantastic Beasts film has halted after a ""team member"" tested positive for coronavirus. The Harry Potter spin-off, which stars Eddie Redmayne and Jude Law, is being shot at Warner Brothers Studios in Leavesden, Hertfordshire. Warner Bros Pictures says the diagnosis came as a result of ""ongoing testing"" all those working on Fantastic Beasts 3 receive. It says production has ""paused"" and theemployee is in isolation. Yolande KnellBBC Middle East correspondent, Jerusalem The Hamas authorities in the Gaza Strip have fully lifted restrictions there after a significant drop in the number of coronavirus cases. Gazaâs seaside cafes, busy shopping centres, mosques and gyms will be fully reopened for the start of the local weekend for the first time in two months. Students will now be allowed to return to schools and universities full-time. Strict quarantine measures as well as Gazaâs relative isolation meant it didnât see its first public outbreak of coronavirus until August. There had been fears a serious Covid outbreak could overwhelm the weak healthcare system in the Palestinian Territory, which has long been under blockade by Israel and Egypt. A strict lockdown initially imposed in Gaza was later replaced by night-time curfews and weekend closures. Now Hamas officials â under pressure to reopen the economy - say the fall in numbers of new cases and those being treated in hospital mean restrictions are no longer needed. No Covid vaccines have yet been sent to Gaza. This video can not be played Covid in Scotland: Snow impact on vaccinations 'concerning' Earlier, Scotland's First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, admitted to concerns about the impact of poor weather conditions on the country's Covid vaccination programme. However, she said plans were in place to help protect the rollout of the jab during the wintry weather. The Met Office has issued an amber warning for ""heavy and persistent"" snow for much of the north of Scotland. The Highlands, Aberdeenshire, Tayside and Perthshire are expected to be the worst affected. More than 10 million first vaccine doses have now been given to people in the UK. The seven-day average for daily doses is currently 430,532. The number of patients in hospital with coronavirus remains high, with 31,670 people hospitalised as of 2 February. This is below the latest peak of hospitalisations seen last month. The number of daily coronavirus cases reported continues to fall, with the seven-day average now 21,246 new cases per day. The government is ""risking lives"" by being too slow to implement a hotel quarantine plan, Labour has claimed. Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced in January that UK residents returning from Covid hotspots would have to quarantine in hotels, but a timetable has not yet been set. Labour has written to Home Secretary Priti Patel to urge her to end the delays and get on with it. But ministers insist there is not a delay and they are working on the scheme ""at pace"" and an announcement will be made next week. Here's the full story. London Underground staff have been told to continue to work, despite a ""stay at home"" plea from the government over concerns with the South African Covid-19 variant. In an emailseen by the LDRS, Transport for London (TfL) told those who cannot work from home to continue working as normal and encouraged them to get a Covid test. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said it is ""critical"" thatpeople in areas singled out for enhanced testing for the South African variantstay at home - this includes parts of London. The RMT union, which represents Tube workers, has called TfLâs advice âtotally unacceptableâ. TfL insists it is still following Government and Public Health England advice and says it is regularly communicating with trade unions. ""We continue to follow our robust cleaning regime and social distancing measures to reduce the risk of infection in the workplace,"" a TfL spokesperson added. Casa Cruz, in Notting Hill A restaurant that broke lockdown rules to host Rita Ora's 30th birthday will not have its licence revoked. The pop star's team offered the manager at Casa Cruz, in Notting Hill, Â£5,000to allow guests to attenda party on 28 November, amid the second virus lockdown, police say. Kensington and Chelsea Council has announced it will suspend Casa Cruz's licence for six weeks. The venue's parent company has been approached for comment. Rita Ora has previouslyapologised for the party. The 30-year-old flew to Egypt for a private performance on 21 November. On her return the following day, she should have isolated for two weeks. Instead, she threw a birthday party in London, which violated lockdown rules that prevented households mixing indoors. Read the full story here. Nathan Orme was jailed at Douglas Courthouse for six weeks A man whose friend visited his home during the Isle of Man's second coronavirus lockdown has been jailed. Nathan Orme, 28, told police the person who had been at his home to get a phone charger was part of his ""bubble"", despite no such rules existing on the island, Douglas Courthouse heard. He admitted to breaking the island's strict Covid-19 laws prohibiting indoor gatherings. Orme, of Anagh Coar Road in Douglas, was sentenced to six weeks in prison. Defence advocate Stephen Wood told the court Orme was a ""damaged man"" and had done ""nothing criminal"" other than meeting with his friend. Orme was previously fined Â£500 for breaking self-isolation rules in May last year after leaving his home following an argument with his girlfriend. Here's the full story. A medical centre received angry calls and one staff member was threatened after players at a nearby football club were given Covid vaccines. Chesterfield FC said some players and staff, ""most of them vulnerable"", were given jabs to stop them being wasted. However, the medical centre which gave the vaccines has received dozens of angry phone calls since news of the vaccinations appeared in the media. One threatened a female member of staff, saying he knew where she lived, prompting police to investigate. Read morehere. Philippa RoxbyHealth reporter, BBC News The number of people who have died within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test in the UK has risen by another 915 today. It means the death toll by this measure is now in excess of 110,000. But after weeks of mounting deaths since mid-December, there are positive signs deaths are finally reducing. In the past week, daily recorded deaths have been lower than every corresponding day in the previous week. And the last time the daily deaths figure was below 1,000 (apart from on a Sunday and Monday when the numbers are usually much lower because of delayed reporting after a weekend) was on 5 January. That was just as lockdown restrictions were being introduced and children were told not to return to school for the new term. Much has changed since then: Hospitals have been under intense pressure because of Covid-19 and millions of people have been vaccinated against the disease. Confirmed cases and hospital admissions have been falling â usually an early indication that the numbers dying will also follow. However, there are clear warnings from health officials that there should be no complacency. Vaccinating the most vulnerable will reduce deaths initially, but it will take many millions more vaccinations for all the over-50s and those with underlying conditions to really reduce the pressure on the countryâs hospitals. All Piers says he wants to do is go to school every day. He doesn't even want a holiday - just school, school and more school. The 18-year-old, who has a form of autism, has not been able to finish the final year of his maths GCSE full-time in the classroom with his friends and teachers because of lockdown. Like some of his friends, Piers has only been in class one day a week - and the restrictions are having a serious impact on their learning. Read morehere. Sweden is developing a digital vaccine certificate to enable
people to show they have been inoculated. The countryâs health minister  Lena Hallengren said the certificate could be used as a passport to âtravel abroad on holiday or
meet a loved oneâ. The government is hoping to get the certificates ready by June. Digitalisation Minister Anders Ygeman said businesses
including restaurants could ask customers to prove they have been
vaccinated,The Local reports,external. Sweden has recorded more than 580,000 cases and 11,939 deaths. The move comes a day after Denmark announced a similar certificate. The
government there announced it would have an online registry that would be used
to check someoneâs vaccination status. This is a temporary measure until a
long-term solution is established. The World Health Organisation has considered the idea
of digital certificates in the past but said last month that it opposed them
being used as a requirement for travel. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Beckham-backed cannabis skincare firm to float,"A company backed by David Beckham, which uses compounds found in cannabis to make skincare and athletic products, plans to sell shares on the London Stock Exchange (LSE). Cellular Goods has sold a stake to DB Ventures, the former footballer's investment firm,Sky News reported,external. The company makes its products in labs, rather than from plants. It is part of a growing market for products which use chemicals found in cannabis for skin regimes. The BBC has approached Mr Beckham and DB Ventures for comment. Two of the main active chemicals found in cannabis plans are cannabidiol (CBD) - often used in skincare products - and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). While THC is a controlled substance, cannabidiol is not. Cellular Goods aims to sell products from September 2021, according to its website, which will make it the first firm of its kind to debut on the LSE. Cannabis companies can list on the LSE so long as they are medicinal, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) watchdog decided last year. While many recreational drug companies have sprung up in the US, where states in including California have legalised it, those companies can't raise money in London, as it is illegal in the UK. ""The last few years have seen massive growth and awareness of the importance of wellness and self-care and we believe cannabinoids will prove to be the king of wellness ingredients,"" said Cellular Goods chief executive Alexis Abraham. ""The appetite for cannabinoid products is huge and the biosynthetic cannabinoids we will be exclusively using are cleaner, greener, purer, and frankly the future."" Sometests show,externalthat stronger forms of CBD can help reduce the number of epileptic seizures in some patients, by more than 40%.

"UK and EU in ""constructive"" talks on NI trade row","Brexit-related checks on products from Great Britain were suspended after threats against port staff The government and the EU have vowed to ""work intensively"" to quell tensions over post-Brexit checks at Northern Ireland ports. In a joint statement, both sides said talks on Wednesday with Northern Ireland leaders were ""constructive"". The talks were arranged after checks at some ports were suspended following ""sinister"" threats made to staff. UK and EU leaders say they condemn ""unreservedly"" any threats or intimidation. DUP urges PM to 'be unionist we need' over Brexit PM urges EU action to ease Brexit tensions in NI What is the Northern Ireland Protocol? Virtual talks between the Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove, his EU counterpart, Vice-President Maros Å efÄoviÄ and Northern Ireland's leaders were held on Wednesday amid an escalating row over applying new trade rules for Northern Ireland. The dispute has arisen because, under the Brexit agreement with the EU, some products entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain must be checked on entry. That is because unlike the rest of the UK, Northern Ireland has remained in the single market for goods. As a result, some food supplies and online shopping deliveries from Great Britain to Northern Ireland have been subject to delays and staff carrying out inspections have reported threats. Tensions were also heightenedwhen the EU threatenedemergency controls of Covid vaccine exports on the Irish border - a move the bloc later withdrew. In a joint statement, Mr Gove and Mr Å efÄoviÄ said they would ""work intensively to find solutions to outstanding issues"". The UK government and EU Commission reiterated their full commitment to the Good Friday Agreement, and to the ""proper implementation"" of the Northern Ireland protocol. Both leaders said they condemned unreservedly any threats or intimidation, and stressed that ""the safety and welfare of the people of Northern Ireland"" would always be the ""utmost priority."" The BBC's political editor, Laura Kuenssberg, says sources told her ""there wasn't much progress"" but both sides have agreed to keep talking. The source added that the EU wasn't in ""sackcloth and ashes"" after it temporarily suspended agreements made as part of the Brexit deal last Friday. The UK government has called for temporary lighter enforcement of the rules to be extended until early 2023. However writing in the Daily Telegraph,,externalNorthern Ireland's First Minister and DUP leader Arlene Foster warned that simply extending grace periods for businesses would not solve the problem. She said the Northern Ireland Protocol - the arrangements for the Irish border - ""cannot work"" and must be replaced. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill, from Sinn Fein, called for calm heads and welcomed Mr Å efÄoviÄ's intended visit to the UK next week for further talks, saying it was a ""very pragmatic and very constructive way"" to move forward. Part of the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement, the NI protocol guarantees an open border between the EU and Northern Ireland, with no controls on exported products. It was introduced to avoid creating a hard border on the island of Ireland. Instead there are checks on some products travelling from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. This is because Northern Ireland in effect remains part of the EU single market for goods while the rest of the UK has left. However, Article 16 of the protocol part of the deal allows the EU and UK to choose to suspend any aspects they consider are causing ""economic, societal or environmental difficulties"". The EU announced it would trigger the clause to control exports of vaccines to Northern Ireland, but laterreversed the decision. Unionist parties in NI have been pressing the UK government to use Article 16 to reduce checks on goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain.

World must ensure Myanmar coup fails - UN chief,"This video can not be played 'Dark old days': What young Burmese fear about the Myanmar coup Myanmar's military rulers have blocked access to Facebook, days after they overthrew the democratic government. Officials said the social media platform - for many in Myanmar the main source of online information - would be blocked for the sake of ""stability"". Facebook has become a key rallying point for opposition to Monday's coup. In further civil disobedience, lawmakers are refusing to leave their compound in the capital, and more pot-banging was seen in Yangon. The coup, led by armed forces chief Min Aung Hlaing, installed an 11-member junta, ending a short period of majority civilian rule. The military said an election in November had been fraudulent - though the country's election commission said there was no evidence to back up such claims. The elected civilian leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, along with President Win Myint, were detained and on Wednesday police filed charges against them. How Facebook became Myanmar's 'digital tea shop' Myanmar coup: What is happening and why? Growing up under Myanmar's military rule The general who returned Myanmar to military rule The charges against her include possession of unlawful communication devices - walkie-talkies used by her security staff. President Myint is accused of breaching Covid rules while campaigning for last November's election, which was won decisively by Ms Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD). The Ministry of Communications and Information said access to Facebook would be blocked until 7 February. However, it was still reported to be accessible sporadically. Anthony Aung, who runs a tour agency in Yangon, the main city, told the BBC at one point he still had access to the site through wifi but not cellular data. He said ""people around me are all rushing to download alternative apps and VPN"" - virtual private networks, which allow users to get round internet restrictions. Hours later, Mr Aung said Facebook had stopped working completely. Yangon student Min Htet said her education had already been suspended due to the Covid pandemic. ""Blocking Facebook today means that the freedom of young people is restricted from now on,"" she told Reuters. This video can not be played Myanmar activists protest against military coup in Mandalay Half of Myanmar's 54 million people use Facebook and activists haveset up a page,externalto co-ordinate opposition to the coup. Facebook became popular in Myanmar - also known as Burma - as the company initially allowed its app to be used without data costs so that consumers could avoid paying expensive telecoms charges. The social media giant acknowledged the disruption, saying ""we urge authorities to restore connectivity so that people in Myanmar can communicate with their families and friends and access important information"". Telecoms company Telenor Myanmar, which is part of the Norwegian Telenor Group, said it would comply with the order to block Facebook, but suggested in a statement that this breached human rights law. A small protest has taken place in front of a university in Myanmar's second city, Mandalay, with reports of four arrests. In Yangon, residents banged cooking pots for a second night running. A woman in the city told the BBC: ""We bang drums as we want the military government and the world to know that we don't agree with this military coup... I want our leader Aung San Suu Kyi back."" More protesters took to the streets in Yangon At least 70 lawmakers with the NLD are refusing to leave a government guest house in the capital, Nay Pyi Taw, and have declared what they are calling a new parliamentary session, BBC Burmese reports. The lawmakers are among hundreds who were confined by the military to guest houses before being told they were free to leave. The streets are for the most part calm with no sign of major protest and a night-time curfew in force. However, hospitals have seen protests. Many medics have either stopped work, or continued while wearing symbols of defiance. But a rally by thousands in support of the military, known as the Tatmadaw, took place in Nay Pyi Taw. Some waved banners saying ""Tatmadaw that loves people"". A rally took place in support of the military regime in the capital, Nay Pyi Taw UN Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres has meanwhile called for constitutional order to be re-established in Myanmar. ""It's absolutely unacceptable to reverse the result of the elections and the will of the people,"" he said. The Security Council adopted a resolution expressing ""deep concern"" and calling for the immediate release of Aung San Suu Kyi. ""The members of the Security Council emphasized the need for the continued support of the democratic transition in Myanmar,"" the 15-member council said in a statement agreed by consensus. On Wednesday, the council failed to agree on a statement condemning the coup, after it was blocked by China, which - as one of five permanent members - has a veto. How the military disrupted Myanmar's internet Myanmar coup: 'Our world turned upside down' Fitness coach films video as Myanmar coup unfolds Department of Agriculture works wearing red ribbons in protest Beijing has long played a role of protecting Myanmar from international scrutiny, and has warned since the coup that sanctions or international pressure would only make things worse. Alongside Russia, it has repeatedly shielded Myanmar from criticism at the UN over the military crackdown on the Muslim minority Rohingya population. Myanmar is a country of 54 million people in South East Asia which shares borders with Bangladesh, India, China, Thailand and Laos. It was ruled by an oppressive military government from 1962 to 2011, leading to international condemnation and sanctions. Aung San Suu Kyi spent years campaigning for democratic reforms. A gradual liberalisation began in 2010, though the military still retained considerable influence. A government led by Ms Suu Kyi came to power after free elections in 2015. But a deadly military crackdown two years later on Rohingya Muslims sent hundreds of thousands fleeing to Bangladesh and triggered a rift between Ms Suu Kyi and the international community. She has remained popular at home and her party won again by a landslide in the November 2020 election. But the military have now stepped in to take control once more.

UK 'must learn from 5G U-turn supplier squeeze'MPs call for a strategy for new technologies such as artificial intelligence and quantum computing.,"The government has ruled all Huawei 5G kits must be removed from UK networks by 2027 The UK will be left vulnerable without a new government strategy on emerging technologies, a parliamentary committee is warning. A U-turn on using the Chinese company Huawei had left the government over-reliant on a small group of 5G technology suppliers, MPs said. Its subsequentstrategy,externalto deal with this had been too vague and too late. And the issue could be repeated in other areas such as quantum computing and artificial intelligence (AI). 5G mobile telecoms networks are being rolled out in the UK, with the hope they boost connectivity and economic growth. But the House of Commons Science and Technology Committee found the process had been made more costly and delayed by the government's decision, last year, to remove Huawei equipment from the network because of concerns over security and US sanctions. And only two other companies could supply the crucial technology, leading to fresh concerns about security and resilience. The government's 5G Supply Chain Diversification Strategy proposes using technology based around open standards. But the committee warned this was not a ""silver bullet"" and other options should be considered. And it wants a more detailed plan in the next three months. But 5G was not the only emerging technology of critical importance to the UK's future, the committee said. And the problems with it were not a ""one-off"". AI and quantum computing could also bring significant benefits and threats, especially with growing divergence from China. And this required more work to avoid another ""supplier squeeze"". The committee called for a risk assessment and action plan in the next year. It wants the government to do more to actively manage research and development, driving the effort of industry and academia to meet long-term objectives. And it said there was a need to co-operate more with like-minded countries, for instance on diversifying the telecoms market. ""A lack of strategic foresight in 5G has seen the UK become dependent on only two vendors for a crucial technology,"" Greg Clark, who chairs the committee, said. ""We must learn from this experience to avoid making our economy and security vulnerable from a lack of acceptable alternatives in emerging technologies."" ""As technologies develop at an ever faster rate, more time must not be lost.""

Female directors make history in Golden GlobesThree women are nominated for best director - the first time more than one has been shortlisted.Entertainment & Arts,"This video can not be played Sarah Jessica Parker announced the nominations Three women have been nominated for best director at the Golden Globe awards - the first time more than one has been shortlisted in a single year. Regina King, Chloe Zhao and Emerald Fennell are up for the prize, which had only previously nominated five women in the Golden Globes' 77-year history. Mank leads the overall film awards race with six nominations, while The Crown leads the TV categories, also with six. Sacha Baron Cohen and Olivia Colman are among the Britons up for acting awards. The nominations belatedly fired the starting gun for this year's Hollywood awards season, which has been delayed because of the coronavirus pandemic. Aaron Sorkin's film drama The Trial of the Chicago 7 and TV comedy Schitt's Creek also performed well, with five nominations each. Golden Globes 2021: The nominations in full Sacha Baron Cohen in Borat Subsequent Moviefilm and Olivia Colman in The Crown Baron Cohen, Colman and Anya Taylor-Joy all scooped two acting nominations each. Baron Cohen said he felt ""overwhelmed and humbled"" to be recognised for the films Borat Subsequent Moviefilm and The Trial of the Chicago 7. ""These two films are different, but they share a common theme,""he wrote on Twitter,external. ""Sometimes we have to protest injustice with our own farce."" He went on to joke that he had already hired Rudy Giuliani, former President Trump's lawyer, to contest the results. The star also has a third nomination, as a producer of the Borat sequel. Taylor-Joy, meanwhile, was shortlisted for Netflix's chess drama The Queen's Gambit and for the Jane Austen film adaptation Emma. Colman, who won best actress in a TV drama for playing the Queen in Netflix's The Crown last year, could repeat that this year, and is also shortlisted for her forthcoming film The Father. Four of Colman's The Crown co-stars were also nominated - Emma Corrin (Princess Diana), Josh O'Connor (Prince Charles), Gillian Anderson (Margaret Thatcher) and Helena Bonham Carter (Princess Margaret). Bookmakers have made the show's fourth season the favourite to win best TV drama ahead of Lovecraft Country, The Mandalorian, Ozark and Ratched. That's all despitea row over how the show portrays the Royal Family. Emma Corrin and Josh O'Connor play Diana and Charles in The Crown's fourth season Series creator Peter Morgan said everyone involved in the Netflix series was ""thrilled to be recognised in this way"". ""This season really seems to have resonated with audiences of all generations all around the world,"" he said. ""We could not be more grateful or more proud."" Hugh Grant and Nicole Kidman are both nominated for The Undoing British stars Riz Ahmed, Sir Anthony Hopkins and Gary Oldman will compete for best actor in a film drama for Sound of Metal, The Father and Mank. They are joined by the late Chadwick Boseman, recognised posthumously for Ma Rainey's Black Bottom, and French-Algerian actor Tahar Rahim, nominated for The Mauritanian. Vanessa Kirby and Carey Mulligan are both in the running for best actress in a film drama for Pieces of a Woman and Promising Young Woman respectively. Small Axe, the landmark series of BBC films that director Steve McQueen has billed as ""love letters to black resilience and triumph in London's West Indian community"", received a nomination for best limited series or TV movie. And John Boyega, who played a pioneering police officer in one instalment, was nominated for best supporting TV actor. John Boyega was nominated for playing PC Leroy Logan in Small Axe McQueen told Entertainment Weekly the nominations were ""incredible"", adding: ""I think what's wonderful about it is that something so modest in what we tried to do has gotten recognised in this way."" Other British stars on the shortlists include Rosamund Pike, Dev Patel, Daniel Kaluuya, Jodie Comer, Matthew Rhys and Nicholas Hoult. Hugh Grant was nominated for best actor in a TV limited series for The Undoing, the same award he won in 2019 for A Very English Scandal. His co-star Nicole Kidman is up against Daisy Edgar-Jones, star of the BBC's Normal People, for the female equivalent. Lily Collins was nominated for Netflix hit Emily In Paris - but there was no space for Michaela Coel or her acclaimed BBC drama I May Destroy You. Emerald Fennell will be familiar to The Crown viewers for playing Camilla Parker-Bowles. The Brit wasn't nominated for her acting - but was nominated for Promising Young Woman, her first feature film as director. She was also nominated for best screenplay for writing the dark comic thriller, and was previously chief writer on the second series of Killing Eve. Left-right: Emerald Fennell, Regina King and Chloe Zhao are all up for best director Film and TV fans will also know Regina King, who won an Oscar and a Golden Globe for acting in 2018's If Beale Street Could Talk, and has now moved behind the camera with One Night in Miami. And Chinese director Chloe Zhao has become the first woman of Asian descent to be up for the Golden Globes' best director prize, for Nomadland. The last female director to be nominated for best director was Ava DuVernay for Selma in 2014, and the only woman ever to have won is Barbra Streisand for Yentl in 1984. Nomadland and Promising Young Woman are also nominated for best film drama alongside Mank, The Trial of the Chicago 7 and The Father. Mank- 6 nominations The Trial of the Chicago 7- 5 The Father- 4 Nomadland- 4 Promising Young Woman- 4 The Crown- 6 nominations Schitt's Creek- 5 Ozark- 4 The Undoing- 4 The Great- 3 Ratched- 3 The Globes split most awards between dramas and musicals/comedies, and the nominees for best musical/comedy film include Music, the directorial debut of pop star Sia. But her film has attracted controversy for its casting of dancer Maddie Ziegler as a young girl on the autism spectrum. Actress Ruth Madeley, who has spina bifida, expressed solidarity with ""every #ActuallyAutistic person who is rightly devastated to see #Sia""s Music nominated"". ""Disabled people are needed in the industry now more than ever to help change the narrative we're all so sick of,""she wrote on Twitter,external. James Corden was nominated for The Prom, but Meryl Streep - who had been hotly tipped - missed out Music is up against the Borat sequel, the Disney+ recording of Broadway hit Hamilton, time loop comedy Palm Springs and Netflix film The Prom. James Corden was a surprise nominee for best actor in a musical or comedy for The Prom, after he was criticised for taking on a character who is, by his own admission, ""as a gay as a bucket of wigs"". RegÃ©-Jean Page and Phoebe Dynevor missed out on nominations for Bridgerton With the cinema shutdown and delays to many films, streaming has gained the upper hand over the past year. As a result, Netflix leads the Golden Globes field with 22 out of the 70 film nominations and 20 out of 54 film nominations - giving the streaming giant one third of all nominations in total. Yet there was no room for its period drama Bridgerton, despite the show becoming the service's ""biggest series ever"". Presented annually by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA), the Golden Globes are the most prestigious movie awards behind the Oscars. This year's winners will be announced at the end of this month in a bi-coastal ceremony hosted by Tina Fey in New York and Amy Poehler in Los Angeles. In a normal year, many of the nominees would be expected to be among the Academy Award nominations. But this is not a normal year. The Oscars will take place two months later than normal, having been put back from the date - 28 February - that the Globes ceremony now occupies. The eligibility period for this year's Oscars has been extended by two months, meaning films released in cinemas or online before the end of February could be in contention. This may not end up making much of a difference - although it could mean that the Globes' traditional role as an awards season indicator may not be as reliable as it sometimes has been.

John Boyega was nominated for playing PC Leroy Logan in Small Axe McQueen told Entertainment Weekly the nominations were ""incredible"", adding: ""I think what's wonderful about it is that something so modest in what we tried to do has gotten recognised in this way."" Other British stars on the shortlists include Rosamund Pike, Dev Patel, Daniel Kaluuya, Jodie Comer, Matthew Rhys and Nicholas Hoult. Hugh Grant was nominated for best actor in a TV limited series for The Undoing, the same award he won in 2019 for A Very English Scandal. His co-star Nicole Kidman is up against Daisy Edgar-Jones, star of the BBC's Normal People, for the female equivalent. Lily Collins was nominated for Netflix hit Emily In Paris - but there was no space for Michaela Coel or her acclaimed BBC drama I May Destroy You. Emerald Fennell will be familiar to The Crown viewers for playing Camilla Parker-Bowles. The Brit wasn't nominated for her acting - but was nominated for Promising Young Woman, her first feature film as director. She was also nominated for best screenplay for writing the dark comic thriller, and was previously chief writer on the second series of Killing Eve. Left-right: Emerald Fennell, Regina King and Chloe Zhao are all up for best director Film and TV fans will also know Regina King, who won an Oscar and a Golden Globe for acting in 2018's If Beale Street Could Talk, and has now moved behind the camera with One Night in Miami. And Chinese director Chloe Zhao has become the first woman of Asian descent to be up for the Golden Globes' best director prize, for Nomadland. The last female director to be nominated for best director was Ava DuVernay for Selma in 2014, and the only woman ever to have won is Barbra Streisand for Yentl in 1984. Nomadland and Promising Young Woman are also nominated for best film drama alongside Mank, The Trial of the Chicago 7 and The Father. Mank- 6 nominations The Trial of the Chicago 7- 5 The Father- 4 Nomadland- 4 Promising Young Woman- 4 The Crown- 6 nominations Schitt's Creek- 5 Ozark- 4 The Undoing- 4 The Great- 3 Ratched- 3 The Globes split most awards between dramas and musicals/comedies, and the nominees for best musical/comedy film include Music, the directorial debut of pop star Sia. But her film has attracted controversy for its casting of dancer Maddie Ziegler as a young girl on the autism spectrum. Actress Ruth Madeley, who has spina bifida, expressed solidarity with ""every #ActuallyAutistic person who is rightly devastated to see #Sia""s Music nominated"". ""Disabled people are needed in the industry now more than ever to help change the narrative we're all so sick of,""she wrote on Twitter,external. James Corden was nominated for The Prom, but Meryl Streep - who had been hotly tipped - missed out Music is up against the Borat sequel, the Disney+ recording of Broadway hit Hamilton, time loop comedy Palm Springs and Netflix film The Prom. James Corden was a surprise nominee for best actor in a musical or comedy for The Prom, after he was criticised for taking on a character who is, by his own admission, ""as a gay as a bucket of wigs"". RegÃ©-Jean Page and Phoebe Dynevor missed out on nominations for Bridgerton With the cinema shutdown and delays to many films, streaming has gained the upper hand over the past year. As a result, Netflix leads the Golden Globes field with 22 out of the 70 film nominations and 20 out of 54 film nominations - giving the streaming giant one third of all nominations in total. Yet there was no room for its period drama Bridgerton, despite the show becoming the service's ""biggest series ever"". Presented annually by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA), the Golden Globes are the most prestigious movie awards behind the Oscars. This year's winners will be announced at the end of this month in a bi-coastal ceremony hosted by Tina Fey in New York and Amy Poehler in Los Angeles. In a normal year, many of the nominees would be expected to be among the Academy Award nominations. But this is not a normal year. The Oscars will take place two months later than normal, having been put back from the date - 28 February - that the Globes ceremony now occupies. The eligibility period for this year's Oscars has been extended by two months, meaning films released in cinemas or online before the end of February could be in contention. This may not end up making much of a difference - although it could mean that the Globes' traditional role as an awards season indicator may not be as reliable as it sometimes has been.

"UK and EU in ""constructive"" talks on NI trade rowBoth sides have vowed to ""work intensively"" to solve post-Brexit trade problems in Northern Ireland.UK Politics","Brexit-related checks on products from Great Britain were suspended after threats against port staff The government and the EU have vowed to ""work intensively"" to quell tensions over post-Brexit checks at Northern Ireland ports. In a joint statement, both sides said talks on Wednesday with Northern Ireland leaders were ""constructive"". The talks were arranged after checks at some ports were suspended following ""sinister"" threats made to staff. UK and EU leaders say they condemn ""unreservedly"" any threats or intimidation. DUP urges PM to 'be unionist we need' over Brexit PM urges EU action to ease Brexit tensions in NI What is the Northern Ireland Protocol? Virtual talks between the Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove, his EU counterpart, Vice-President Maros Å efÄoviÄ and Northern Ireland's leaders were held on Wednesday amid an escalating row over applying new trade rules for Northern Ireland. The dispute has arisen because, under the Brexit agreement with the EU, some products entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain must be checked on entry. That is because unlike the rest of the UK, Northern Ireland has remained in the single market for goods. As a result, some food supplies and online shopping deliveries from Great Britain to Northern Ireland have been subject to delays and staff carrying out inspections have reported threats. Tensions were also heightenedwhen the EU threatenedemergency controls of Covid vaccine exports on the Irish border - a move the bloc later withdrew. In a joint statement, Mr Gove and Mr Å efÄoviÄ said they would ""work intensively to find solutions to outstanding issues"". The UK government and EU Commission reiterated their full commitment to the Good Friday Agreement, and to the ""proper implementation"" of the Northern Ireland protocol. Both leaders said they condemned unreservedly any threats or intimidation, and stressed that ""the safety and welfare of the people of Northern Ireland"" would always be the ""utmost priority."" The BBC's political editor, Laura Kuenssberg, says sources told her ""there wasn't much progress"" but both sides have agreed to keep talking. The source added that the EU wasn't in ""sackcloth and ashes"" after it temporarily suspended agreements made as part of the Brexit deal last Friday. The UK government has called for temporary lighter enforcement of the rules to be extended until early 2023. However writing in the Daily Telegraph,,externalNorthern Ireland's First Minister and DUP leader Arlene Foster warned that simply extending grace periods for businesses would not solve the problem. She said the Northern Ireland Protocol - the arrangements for the Irish border - ""cannot work"" and must be replaced. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill, from Sinn Fein, called for calm heads and welcomed Mr Å efÄoviÄ's intended visit to the UK next week for further talks, saying it was a ""very pragmatic and very constructive way"" to move forward. Part of the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement, the NI protocol guarantees an open border between the EU and Northern Ireland, with no controls on exported products. It was introduced to avoid creating a hard border on the island of Ireland. Instead there are checks on some products travelling from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. This is because Northern Ireland in effect remains part of the EU single market for goods while the rest of the UK has left. However, Article 16 of the protocol part of the deal allows the EU and UK to choose to suspend any aspects they consider are causing ""economic, societal or environmental difficulties"". The EU announced it would trigger the clause to control exports of vaccines to Northern Ireland, but laterreversed the decision. Unionist parties in NI have been pressing the UK government to use Article 16 to reduce checks on goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain.

"'Not practical' to close UK borders, says PMLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer wants tougher restrictions to prevent new coronavirus variants coming in.","It is ""not practical"" to completely close the UK's borders given the amount of medicines and food imported into the country, the prime minister has said. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer called for tougher restrictions to prevent new coronavirus variants entering the UK. Boris Johnson said the government had already tightened travel restrictions to reduce the spread of the virus. He said it would be going ahead with its plan for quarantine hotels for people arriving from Covid hotspots. It is not yet clear when the scheme - announced a week ago - will start or when there will be further details. Speaking during Prime Minister's Questions, Sir Keir said government scientists had recommended ""a complete pre-emptive closure of borders"". In response, Mr Johnson said: ""Actually, Sage (the Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies) did not recommend a complete ban and they say travel bans should not be relied upon to stop the importation of new variants. ""But we do have one of the toughest regimes in the world."" Why hasn't the UK closed its borders? South Africa coronavirus variant: What's the risk? What are the UK travel rules? Rules around international travel were tightened last month,meaning all travellers must self-isolate for 10 days when they return to the UK. The government also announced plans to make people quarantine in government-sanctioned hotels when arriving in the UK from certain ""high risk"" countries, where new coronavirus variants have been identified. The prime minister said at Wednesday evening's Downing Street briefing that Health Secretary Matt Hancock would make a statement on Thursday to give further details, although No 10 later clarified to say this was not happening. Labour chairwoman of the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee Yvette Coopertweeted,externalin response: ""Oh for heaven's sake. Who is in charge of this borders policy? When will we get details? Does anyone have a grip?"" The UK has placed 33 high-risk countries ona so-called ""red list"",,externalincluding most of South America, southern Africa and Portugal. Scotland has announcedit will extend the measures to all travellers. Sir Keir said the government's new border arrangements were ""still weeks away"" from being introduced and would only affect direct flights from some countries. He asked whether the prime minister was saying that ""quarantining all arrivals would make no difference to fighting new variants of the virus"", or that it was ""too difficult to do it"". Mr Johnson responded by saying that 75% of the UK's medicines come into the country from the European mainland, 45% of food, while 250,000 businesses rely on imports. ""It is not practical to completely close off this country as he seems to be suggesting,"" he said. Introducing quarantine hotels is a logistical challenge. The government needs to make sure hotels are ready. That doesn't just mean securing enough rooms and making sure all the guests can have meals delivered, but also coming up with policies around things like security if a guest tries to leave early. The government could use existing guidelines written up by countries such as New Zealand as a template. Airlines and airports also have questions about how this will work and some areas are complicated. For instance, the policy currently only applies to arrivals from 33 countries - all of whom will arrive on indirect flights. Should airlines separate passengers from low and high-risk countries onboard? But the policy also requires compliance from passengers. If passengers split their tickets and don't declare they've been in one of the 33 high-risk countries, how will the government keep track? There are plenty of questions from all quarters about how to make this policy effective. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps also defended the government's decision not to extend the hotel quarantine policy to arrivals from all countries. He told the Commons Transport Committee: ""The idea that the UK could completely batten down its hatches and remain battened down for a year is mistaken. But also the evidence that that is the only thing you need to do, or primary thing you need to do, is pretty shaky."" Mr Shapps also said the hotel quarantine scheme would not affect many people. ""The 33 countries on the so-called red list do not have direct flightsâ¦ so the numbers we would expect to see returning would be quite low,"" he said.

UK 'past peak' but Covid infections still 'high',"This video can not be played Prof Chris Whitty: ""Vaccines are going to protect in three different ways"" The UK is ""past the peak"" of the current wave of the pandemic but infection rates are still high, England's chief medical officer says. Prof Chris Whitty said the number of cases, hospitalisations and deaths were on a ""downward slope"" but that did not mean there would not be another peak. Boris Johnson praised the ""colossal"" effort to vaccinate 10 million people, including 90% of those aged over 75. But the NHS was still under ""huge pressure"", the prime minister said. New vaccine 'ready by autumn' to tackle mutations 'Not practical' to close UK borders, says PM How many people have been vaccinated so far? Speaking at a Downing Street briefing, Prof Whitty said while the number of people in hospital with Covid-19 had reduced ""quite noticeably"", it was still above that of the first peak in April 2020. ""So this is still a very major problem, but it is one that is heading the right way,"" he said. Prof Whitty said infection rates were ""coming down but they are still incredibly high"". If the rate was to increase again ""from the very high levels we are at the moment the NHS will get back into trouble extraordinarily fast"", he added. His comments were echoed by the prime minister, who warned the level of infection was still ""forbiddingly high"" and that it was too soon to relax current restrictions. On Wednesday the UK recorded a further 1,322 deaths reported within 28 days of a positive test for coronavirus, bringing the total number of people who have died by this measure to 109,335, while a further 19,202 new cases were recorded. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? YOUR QUESTIONS:We answer your queries GLOBAL SPREAD:How many worldwide cases are there? VACCINES:Those that work - and others on the way Mr Johnson told the briefing: ""Though today there are some signs of hope - the numbers of Covid patients in hospital are beginning to fall for the first time since the onset of this new wave - the level of infection is still alarmingly high."" There are also about 32,000 Covid patients in hospital, he added. The prime minister said he hoped schools in England would be able to begin reopening from 8 March, as evidence showed the coronavirus vaccines reduced ""death and serious illness"" from the main strains of the disease. But he insisted the government would not be opening schools any earlier than this date, despite First Minister Nicola Sturgeon saying that schools in Scotland would begin a phased reopening from 22 February. Elsewhere, the Welsh government is due to make a decision by the end of the week on whether to reopen its schools after the February half-term. Prof Whitty said schools in England had been managing to ""hold the line"" and remain open up until the new, more transmissible variant of the virus hit. He said it was up to ministers to decide the opening dates for schools but that he was confident the risk to children of getting Covid-19 was ""incredibly low"". Meanwhile, he warned that predictions that every adult could offered a first dose of a vaccine by May and a second by August were ""at the very optimistic end"" due to supply constraints. Mr Johnson said at the news conference the government would be sticking with its ""cautious"" approach. He said ministers would outline a ""route map"" out of lockdown on 22 February and that the country would be in ""a very different situation"" to last summer, when disease levels had been reduced but there was no vaccine. Vaccines are being given to the most vulnerable first. A list ofnine high-priority groups,externalwhich covers about 32 million people - including 90-99% of those most at risk of dying - is being followed, with an aim to vaccinate the first four by 15 February. There is a lot to be hopeful for. The vaccine rollout is going well. Infection levels and the numbers in hospital are coming down - and there are early signs the same is happening with deaths. Progress should continue in the coming weeks as the impact of vaccination starts to kick in - deaths could then start falling rapidly. But the great unlocking will have to be slow. Why? While the numbers in hospital are coming down, it's from an incredibly high base. There are still 50% more patients in hospital now than there were during the first peak. The pressures are going to be severe for some time. What is more, come mid-February when all the over 70s will have been offered the jab, there will still be significant numbers at risk of hospitalisation if they are infected. Most deaths are in the over-70s, but close to half of hospital cases are in the under-70s. A delicate balance will have to be struck until the over-50s are protected. Earlier, Health Secretary Matt Hancock hailed the results of a study which showedthe Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine might reduce the spread of coronavirusas ""absolutely superb"". The researchers behind the jab have also said that a vaccine to tackle variants of the viruscould be ready to deploy by the autumnshould they be needed. A ""small number"" of cases of the coronavirus variant first identified in South Africa have been found inBirminghamas well as three cases without any travel history inWales. It comes after door-to-door testing has been launched to detect the mutation, which is thought to bemore infectious but not necessarily more deadly. The prime minister also led a clap for fundraiserCaptain Sir Tom Moore. The 100-year-old, who raised almost Â£33m for NHS charities by walking laps of his garden, died with coronavirus in Bedford Hospital on Tuesday.

UK 'must learn from 5G U-turn supplier squeeze',"The government has ruled all Huawei 5G kits must be removed from UK networks by 2027 The UK will be left vulnerable without a new government strategy on emerging technologies, a parliamentary committee is warning. A U-turn on using the Chinese company Huawei had left the government over-reliant on a small group of 5G technology suppliers, MPs said. Its subsequentstrategy,externalto deal with this had been too vague and too late. And the issue could be repeated in other areas such as quantum computing and artificial intelligence (AI). 5G mobile telecoms networks are being rolled out in the UK, with the hope they boost connectivity and economic growth. But the House of Commons Science and Technology Committee found the process had been made more costly and delayed by the government's decision, last year, to remove Huawei equipment from the network because of concerns over security and US sanctions. And only two other companies could supply the crucial technology, leading to fresh concerns about security and resilience. The government's 5G Supply Chain Diversification Strategy proposes using technology based around open standards. But the committee warned this was not a ""silver bullet"" and other options should be considered. And it wants a more detailed plan in the next three months. But 5G was not the only emerging technology of critical importance to the UK's future, the committee said. And the problems with it were not a ""one-off"". AI and quantum computing could also bring significant benefits and threats, especially with growing divergence from China. And this required more work to avoid another ""supplier squeeze"". The committee called for a risk assessment and action plan in the next year. It wants the government to do more to actively manage research and development, driving the effort of industry and academia to meet long-term objectives. And it said there was a need to co-operate more with like-minded countries, for instance on diversifying the telecoms market. ""A lack of strategic foresight in 5G has seen the UK become dependent on only two vendors for a crucial technology,"" Greg Clark, who chairs the committee, said. ""We must learn from this experience to avoid making our economy and security vulnerable from a lack of acceptable alternatives in emerging technologies.""

Italy turns to Draghi to fix government stalemate,"Mario Draghi (R) has agreed to put forward a new administration in the hope of fixing a fractured parliament Italy's president has asked the former head of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi, to form a new government after the previous coalition collapsed. President Sergio Mattarella said Italy needed a ""high-profile government"" to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic and the worst economic crisis in decades. Politicians failed to agree a coalition following the resignation of Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte last week. Mr Draghi will now have to put forward an administration that leaders support. He was summoned to Rome's historic Quirinale Palace on Wednesday by President Mattarella, who gave Mr Draghi a mandate and said he hoped he would break the parliamentary stalemate. In a brief statement after accepting the challenge, Mr Draghi said Italy was facing a ""difficult moment"" and that it was time for unity. ""I am confident that in talks with parliamentary and other groups, we will find unity and the ability to find a responsible solution."" Italy's financial markets welcomed the news that the country's star technocrat had been brought in, with the Milan stock market up almost 3%. On paper, Mr Draghi has impeccable credentials, BBC Rome correspondent Mark Lowen reports. Political parties have been divided over how to spend â¬222bn (Â£195bn; $267bn) of EU Covid recovery funds, amid a pandemic in which nearly 90,000 Italians have died - the sixth highest death toll in the world. However, Italy's anti-establishment Five Star Movement (M5S), which has been in government since 2018, has already said that it will not back a government led by Mr Draghi. Sometimes referred to as ""Super Mario"" - after the hero Italian character in a Nintendo video game - Mr Draghi steered the eurozone through the financial crisis during his eight years as president of the European Central Bank (ECB). Some analysts and commentators credit him with saving both the eurozone and the euro currency. The eurozone financial crisis was already a serious problem when Mr Draghi took office at the ECB in November 2011. At its height, the crisis raised concerns that the eurozone could break up altogether. Mr Draghi responded by promising to do ""whatever it takes to preserve the euro"", calling for ""urgent action"" to implement a substantial bailout fund. His call for governments to come together and play their role in tackling the debt crisis collectively was initially met with resistance from Germany, but it eventually paid off. Economies began to grow and subsequently no country left the eurozone. In his statement on Wednesday he said the challenges Italy now faced were ""beating the pandemic, completing the vaccination campaign, offering answers to everyday challenges and getting the country back on track"". ""Mario Draghi was the Italian who saved Europe, and I think now he is the European who can save Italy,""former Prime Minister Matteo Renzi told the BBC's Newshour programme. Did Super-Mario Draghi save the eurozone? Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, a technocrat like Mr Draghi, resigned last week after losing his Senate majority - which restricted his ability to perform government business - and failing to form a new coalition. Mr Conte led two coalition governments until one of the parties pulled out last month The political turmoil came about when former PM Matteo Renzi pulled his small, liberal Italia Viva party out of the centrist coalition government over Mr Conte's plans for spending EU recovery funds on the coronavirus crisis. He said he would only return if Mr Conte accepted a list of demands. Mr Conte then won a vote of confidence in the lower house, the Chamber of Deputies, but he then scraped through a Senate vote without an absolute majority. He said he hoped his resignation would result in the creation of a stronger coalition government. He had previously led two very different, successive coalition governments from 2018. For 15 months he headed a coalition between M5S and the far-right League, until its leader Matteo Salvini pulled out in a failed bid to force elections. Mr Conte then led a four-party, centre-left coalition dominated by M5S and the Democratic Party (PD). Mr Renzi said there was now a good opportunity for Italy to find a new direction. ""In a time of difficulty, that is the period in which we are to risk change, to invest in the future - if we're not now able to change strategy, we risk also destroying [Italy] post-pandemic.""

US country star dropped by label over racial slurUS singer Morgan Wallen has also seen his music removed by hundreds of US radio stations.Entertainment & Arts,"Wallen was named best new artist at the 2020 Country Music Association Awards US country star Morgan Wallen has been dropped by his record label, after a video emerged of him using a racial slur. Nashville's Big Loud Records said it had ""made the decision to suspend Morgan Wallen's recording contract indefinitely"" in light of the video. In the footage, reportedly filmed by a neighbour last weekend, the 27-year-old is seen saying goodbye to some friends and calling one of them the N-word. He has apologised for the incident. ""I'm embarrassed and sorry,""he told TMZ,external, which first published the footage. ""I used an unacceptable and inappropriate racial slur that I wish I could take back. There are no excuses to use this type of language, ever. I want to sincerely apologise for using the word. I promise to do better."" Wallen, whose career began on the US version of TV talent show The Voice, is currently one of the biggest country stars in the US. His latest record, Dangerous: The Double Album, has been number one on the Billboard chart for the last three weeks; and his last four singles have reached number one on the country airplay chart. Radio stations drop country star over racial slur The troubled history of the N-word However, the industry's response to his use of a racial slur has been swift and decisive. Within 24 hours of TMZ publishing its video, Wallen's music was pulled from the airwaves by iHeartMedia, the largest radio station group in the US, which owns more than 850 stations, including 135 country music stations. Other major networks, including Cumulus Media and Entercom, have also removed his music from their playlists. ""In light of Morgan Wallen's recent actions involving the use of a racial slur, we have made the decision to remove his music and content from our stations effective immediately,"" said a spokesman for iHeart. Broadcaster Country Music Television also distanced itself from the star. ""After learning of Morgan Wallen's racial slur late last night, we are in the process of removing his appearances from all our platforms,"" said the company in a statement. ""We do not tolerate or condone words and actions that are in direct opposition to our core values that celebrate diversity, equity and inclusion."" And the Academy of Country Music said it was revoking Wallen's ""potential involvement and eligibility"" for this year's ACM Awards. ""As a result of this unprecedented situation, the Academy will be reviewing our awards eligibility and submission process, ensuring our nominees consistently reflect the Academy's integrity,"" it said in a statement. This video can not be played Does country music recognise its roots? Wallen's songs also appear to have been removed from Spotify's Hot Country Songs playlist and Apple Music's equivalent, Today's Country. Those moves are particularly significant because, unusually for a country album, Dangerous has been a smash on streaming services. According to MRC Data, which compiles the US charts, 88% of its consumption has been online. Big Loud Records said its decision to drop the star had been supported by Republic Records, a division of Universal Music, with which it partners to release Wallen's records. The singer is yet to comment on the situation. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.
