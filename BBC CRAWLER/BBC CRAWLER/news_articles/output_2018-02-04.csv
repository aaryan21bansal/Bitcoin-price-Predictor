Crashed Amtrak train 'on wrong track',"This video can not be played The crash happened in the early hours of Sunday morning An Amtrak train involved in a deadly crash with a stationary freight train in South Carolina appeared to be on the wrong track, the state governor says. Officials will investigate whether points in the area misdirected the passenger train. The Amtrak's engineer and conductor died and 116 people were injured in the crash early on Sunday. South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster said the incident should ""begin a conversation"" about rail safety. Just four days ago,a lorry driver was killed when his vehicle was hit by a train carrying lawmakers in Virginia. Sunday's crash happened at 02:35 local time (07:35 GMT) in the town of Cayce, just outside the state capital, Columbia. The train was travelling from New York to Miami when it hit the goods train, causing its lead engine and several carriages to derail. The dead Amtrak workers have been named as engineer Michael Kempf, 54, from Georgia, and conductor Michael Cella, 36, of Florida. Three of the injured were said to be in a serious condition. Most injuries ranged from scratches to broken bones. President Donald Trump tweeted that his thoughts and prayers were with the victims. Allow Twitter content?

The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the crash, with the co-operation of CSX, which is responsible for operating the railway in the area. There had been concern about 5,000 gallons (19,000 litres) of fuel that spilled after the crash but the site has now been declared safe. There were 139 passengers and eight Amtrak staff on the train. Governor McMaster said that ""it appears the Amtrak was on the wrong track"" and the unmanned goods train ""was on the track it was supposed to be on"". Sources quoted by NBC News said CSX signals in the area had been taken offline to undergo work. They said the Amtrak was given verbal approval to take one track but points may have been wrongly set there, sending the Amtrak on to a side track and into the goods train. A computer system called Positive Train Control (PTC), which the sources said could have prevented the crash, was not in operation in the area. PTC has been delayed in many areas due to costs and technical issues. The Amtrak was travelling at 59mph (95km/h) upon impact, Governor McMaster said. He added: ""It's a horrible thing to see, to understand what force was involved. The first engine of the freight train was torn up, and the single engine of the passenger train is barely recognisable."" Connecticut Senator Richard Blumenthal reinforced Mr McMaster's call for a rail safety conversation, saying safety had to improve. Allow Twitter content?

Passengers said the crash had caused chaos in the middle of the night. One, Erin Wittman, told MSNBC: ""We just awoke to violent shaking; I just knew immediately we were off the tracks and I couldn't believe it was actually happening."" Concerns about safety standards on the US rail network have been raised after a number of fatal train crashes in recent years: February 2018:Crozet, Virginia.

MLA Gerry Kelly questioned over car clamp,"This video can not be played Sinn FÃ©in's Gerry Kelly was filmed removing a car clamp Sinn FÃ©in's Gerry Kelly has been interviewed by police for alleged criminal damage after he was filmed removing a clamp from his car. The North Belfast MLA wasrecorded using what appears to be bolt cutters to remove the clamp on Friday. In a tweet on Sunday evening, Mr Kelly said: ""No one can be above the law."" He said he had made a ""voluntary arrangement"" to talk to police. Footage of the incident was posted on social media. His actions were criticised by other political parties. Stormontgate. Namagate. Clampgate? In his tweet, Mr Kelly said he wanted to resolve the matter ""as soon as possible"". Earlier, police confirmed they had interviewed a 64-year-old man at Musgrave Park police station in relation to an allegation of criminal damage at Exchange Street in Belfast on Friday.

DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds said this was a ""significant test for the Sinn FÃ©in leadership"". On Saturday, Sinn FÃ©in said the matter was being dealt with by Mr Kelly's solicitor. Sinn FÃ©in said Mr Kelly removed the clamp ""after an early morning gym session"" The incident happened near the Metropolitan Arts Centre (MAC). The clamp was fitted by a private company called Parking and Enforcement Agency (PEA). Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Its spokesman told theBelfast Telegraph,external: ""PEA is aware of this incident and has reported the matter to the PSNI as we do in all such cases."" Mr Kelly is also Sinn FÃ©in's policing spokesperson. He is also a former member of the Northern Ireland Policing Board, which holds the PSNI to account. Footage of the incident was posted on social media Mr Dodds, DUP, asked: ""Will Gerry Adams, Mary Lou McDonald or Michelle O'Neill finally take action when we have their policing spokesperson act like this? ""Nobody's holding their breath."" Clamping in Northern Ireland The Department for Infrastructure (DfI) is responsible for the enforcement of most parking restrictions. Clamping and removal are used when parking tickets have not been paid. But the department has no responsibility when it comes to private land, such as a retail park, hospital or supermarket. Landowners can set their own rules and hire firms to police their parking restrictions. When it comes to clamping and towing on private land, Northern Ireland is out on its own. The Protection of Freedoms Act outlawed the practice in England and Wales in 2012. It has been banned in Scotland since 1992. But in Gerry Kelly's case, there is another law at play - the Criminal Damage (Northern Ireland) Order 1977, which means you cannot damage other people's property ""without lawful excuse"". Clamping and criminal damage has been tested in the courts elsewhere. In 1991, a motorist in England was found guilty of causing criminal damage to property after he forcibly removed a clamp from his car in a private car park. His defence was that he had a lawful excuse for cutting the padlocks in that wheel-clamping was a trespass to his car, and under the principle of the ""recaption of goods"" he was entitled to recover his car. However, a year later, a Scottish appeal court called clamping ""extortion and theft"". ""The act of depriving the motorist of the use of his car by detaining it against his will can accurately be described as stealing something from him,"" one of the judges said. Mr Dodds said that Sinn FÃ©in ""preach"" respect and equality, but this incident suggested otherwise. Sinn FÃ©in's Mary Lou McDonald, who will take over the party leadership next weekend, said she did not know enough about the incident to comment. Speaking to RTÃ on Sunday morning, she said: ""Gerry's solicitors are currently dealing with the issue of the clamping. ""I have to tell you that I don't have the detail on it and we'll have to see what flows from that, but I'm reluctant to comment any further because I don't have the facts of exactly what happened. Mary Lou McDonald said she did not know enough about the incident to comment ""I'm only in a position to say that his solicitors are dealing with the issue, as they should,"" she added. The leader of the Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) party, Jim Allister, criticised Mr Kelly on BBC Radio Ulster. ""He, who sat in the Policing Board, pontificating about law and order issues, should now think that he can take the law into his own hands and behave in this manner needs to be called to account. ""Not just in respect of the criminal law, in regard to criminal damage, but in respect of public representation, by being removed as a public representative."" Mr Kelly's car was in a ""no parking"" area Ulster Unionist MLA Roy Beggs said Mr Kelly had set ""an appalling example"" and should ""do the decent thing and resign"". ""Parking in a no-parking area, which reserves access for deliveries and emergencies, then damaging private property. ""What if everyone ignored yellow lines? ""Is Gerry special, above the rules that apply to you and me?"" Mr Beggs added: ""If this was to happen in any other part of the United Kingdom or indeed the Republic, the relevant politician would be gone."" Alliance MLA Paula Bradshaw said Mr Kelly's actions were ""ironic"" given that he was Sinn FÃ©in's spokesperson on justice issues. ""This is the sort of stuff that reflects very much on the behaviour of MLAs and I would very much like the assembly back up and running this week so that this could be looked at as an internal matter in terms of his conduct as a public representative.""

Mass Greek protest over Macedonia name,"Protesters from far and wide, including some from other countries - flooded Syntagma Square in Athens Tens of thousands of Greeks have taken to the streets of Athens in a protest about the decades-long dispute over the name Macedonia. Police said some 140,000 people joined the rally, but organisers put the turnout closer to 1.5 million people. Many Greeks object to the country of the same name calling itself Macedonia, saying it implies a territorial claim on Greece's northern Macedonia region. Protesters oppose Greek government proposals on resolving the issue. Celebrated Zorba The Greek composer Mikis Theodorakis, 92, was among those addressing the crowds. Anarchists daubed red paint over his home on Saturday but he was unfazed, declaring, ""I am calm and ready."" The man who has focused on one word for 23 years What's in a name? Macedonia country profile Demonstrators carrying Greek flags chanted ""hands off Macedonia"" and ""Macedonia is Greece"", as they assembled in Syntagma Square outside parliament. Mr Theodorakis urged the crowds to hold out for an acceptable solution to the dispute with the ""Skopjans"", as he termed the northern neighbour ""Macedonia was, is and will forever be Greek,"" Mr Theodorakis told the huge crowds, adding that any suggestion of a name to resolve the dispute must be put to a referendum. ""If a government considers signing on behalf of our country... there is no doubt it must first ask the Greek people."" He said the neighbouring northern state was ""illegitimate"". Greek Foreign Minister Nikos Kotzias recently received death threats when he said he expected the dispute to be resolved within months. It is the second such protest inside two weeks ""Here are the borders,"" said protester Rania Mainou from Xanthi in northern Greece. ""This is Macedonia. Here, these are Slavs, they are not Macedonians, we are Macedonians. Macedonia is Greek, no one can take this name, no one can use it."" It is the second such protest in a fortnight. Some 90,000 demonstrators rallied in Thessaloniki, the capital of the Macedonia region, on 21 January. The dispute has simmered since Macedonia gained independence from Yugoslavia in 1991 and it has held up its attempts to join Nato and the EU. Greece's left-wing Syriza government says the issue is a diplomatic obstacle it wants resolved and has proposed agreeing to a composite name for the country which would include the word Macedonia but ensure a clear differentiation from the Greek region. For many people in Macedonia, this name is the logical option because of a geographical connection with the ancient kingdom of Macedon, once ruled by Alexander the Great. However, the identity and origins of the people of Macedonia are the subject of heated historical debate. Prime Minister Zoran Zaev said last month that Macedonia would change the name of its airport from Skopje Alexander the Great airport, to show good will. The Greek Orthodox Church backs the campaign to stop Macedonia using any variant of the name. In organisations such as the UN, where talks have been under way, the country is officially known as the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) At home, the Macedonian government calls the country it administers simply ""Republic of Macedonia"". UN mediator Matthew Nimetz has suggested alternatives such as ""Republic of New Macedonia"". A proposal to name it ""Republic of Macedonia-Skopje"" was reportedly accepted by Greece but rejected by Macedonia.

Top North Korea official to head South,"It is unclear whether Kim Yong-nam, who heads the parliament in Pyongyang, will attend the opening ceremony along with US Vice President Mike Pence North Korea's head of state will go to Pyeongchang this week for the Winter Olympics, the most senior official to ever visit South Korea. North Korea confirmed Kim Yong-nam's attendance at the opening ceremony, set for Friday. Both Koreas will march under one flag at the opening ceremony. Although this signals a thaw in relations between the Koreas, experts say it is unlikely to have any impact on the North's nuclear ambitions. Mr Kim will be in the South for a three-day visit and will lead a 22-member delegation. North v South: A history of sport, bombs and diplomacy How good is North Korea at sport? North Korea crisis in 300 words The 90-year-old Kim Yong-nam has seen the rule of all three North Korean leaders in his career. He is the ceremonial head of state who receives credentials from foreign diplomats in Pyongyang. As such, he is usually responsible for sending condolences or congratulatory messages to foreign leaders. He has been the president of North Korea's rubber-stamp parliament, the Supreme People's Assembly, since 1998. Unlike the current leader Kim Jong-un, Kim Yong-nam has travelled abroad on official visits. In August 2017, he travelled to Iran to attend President Hassan Rouhani's inauguration ceremony for his second term in office. The two Koreas, still technically at war, are separated by a Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) He also attended the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympic Games in Sochi, Russia in 2014. Mr Kim is said to be a loyal follower of the top leadership. ""As Kim is known to be acting and speaking under the country's guidance, he makes no mistakes. That's why he could keep his high-level post in a country where political purges are common,"" South Korea's Yonhap news agency quoted one North Korean defector as saying. An unnamed official from the South's presidential Blue House told the BBC that they believed Mr Kim's visit reflected a willingness on the part of North Korea to improve inter-Korean relations, and demonstrated the North's sincerity. Seoul has said it will seek high-level talks with the North Korean delegation during the visit, Yonhap reported. Mr Kim's attendance at the opening ceremony will also put him in the company of US Vice President Mike Pence, at a point of high tension with Washington over the North's nuclear ambitions. In another development on Sunday, the Washington Post reported thatFred Warmbier, whose son Otto Warmbier was jailed by North Korea and died days after returning to the US, would attend the opening ceremony as a guest of Mr Pence,external. Mr Warmbier and his wife, Cindy, were guests of US President Donald Trump at last week's State of the Union address. North Korea on Monday proposed sending an art troupe to the Games by ferry, a move that would require an exemption from bilateral sanctions. Pyongyang proposed that its delegation use the Mangyongbong 92, a ferry that usually operates between North Korea and Russia, for transportation and as accommodation for the group, according to the South's unification ministry. All North Korean ships have been banned from entering South Korean ports since 2010. ""We're seeking to apply an exemption... to support a successful hosting of the Olympics,"" South Korean ministry spokesman Baik Tae-hyun told a press conference. On Sunday, the united Korean women's ice hockey team played its first match, but lost the friendly against Sweden 1-3. The newly formed joint Korean ice hockey team did not prevail in the friendly against Sweden Sunday's outing was the first and only practice match for the newly minted Korean squad. As well as the ice hockey players, North Korean athletes will compete in skiing and figure skating events. It is also sending hundreds of delegates, cheerleaders and performers. North Korea currently faces growing international pressure and sanctions over its nuclear and missile programmes after it conducted a series of missile tests designed to demonstrate its nuclear capability. North Korea's participation in the Olympics, which run from 9 to 25 February, was an unexpected warming of ties. It came after the hereditary leaderKim Jong-un extended an olive branch to the South in a New Year message, saying he was open to dialogue and could send a team to the Games. However, there have already been some signs of the tensions that underpins this relationship. Earlier this week it emerged that the North had scheduled a large-scale military parade for 8 February, the day before the Winter Olympics commences. This video can not be played North Korea's women's ice hockey team arrived in the South last week Amid negative headlines,North Korea said no-one had the right to take issue with its plansand promptly cancelled a cultural event it was to hold jointly with the South. Meanwhile, although Seoul and Washington have agreed to delay the annual big joint military exercises which always enrage the North, they will still go ahead at the end of the Paralympics.

Ferry deck officer saves drowning man,"Steve Chamberlain recovered the man from the Portsmouth Harbour A ferry company said it was ""proud"" of one of its deck officers who jumped off a vessel to save a drowning man. The man was spotted in the freezing waters of Portsmouth Harbour from a Wightlink ferry late on Saturday. Steve Chamberlain said he acted ""instinctively"" when he saw the man was in trouble. Operations director Daryl Palmer said: ""We are very proud of Steve and his colleagues for acting so promptly."" The ferry, St Clare, was at its berth at the Gunwharf car ferry terminal, preparing to sail at midnight to Fishbourne on the Isle of Wight. The crew on the car deck saw a man in the water and at first threw a life ring in his direction. The man was spotted in the water by crew members of the Wightlink ferry St Clare Mr Chamberlain, who previously served in the Royal Navy, said: ""I just acted instinctively when we saw the man wasn't able to get into the life ring. ""We carry out emergency drills all the time but it's different when it's happening for real. ""Getting the man to safety was teamwork and I'm grateful to my fellow crew members for their support."" Mr Chamberlain recovered the man from the harbour, who was conscious but suffering from hypothermia. He was treated by paramedics at the pontoon in Broad Street, Old Portsmouth and then taken to Queen Alexandra Hospital, where he is recovering. When Mr Chamberlain returned to the terminal ticket office, staff had blankets and warm clothing ready. He was also taken to hospital but later discharged. Mr Palmer said: ""It was a cold winter's night and I'm sure the man would have died from hypothermia if he had not been spotted by the crew and rescued by Steve.""

Ellie Lacey, 31, from Cardiff, ran 8.8 miles (14.2km) across Rhossili beach on Gower on Sunday to map the words ""Thank You NHS"" using the app Strava. She was diagnosed with liver failure in autumn 2016 and was told her only hope of survival was a liver transplant, which she received in January 2017. ""We're just so happy. Without those people I wouldn't be here,"" she said. 'Living life for me and my organ donor' Does an opt-out system increase transplants? Why does England have an opt-in system? Just six months after the transplant, keen-runner Mrs Lacey won gold at the British Transplant Games and she hopes to compete at the 2019 World Transplant Games. She and her husband Paul said they wanted to find a special way to say thank you to the NHS for saving her life. It took one hour and 23 minutes to create the message. This video can not be played Ellie Lacey says she is now living life for her and her donor The couple had tried to create the ""drawing"" on two previous occasions but heavy rain and floods stopped them from doing so. ""It was definitely third time lucky,"" she said. ""The weather was absolutely freezing on the beach but just as we started to write the letters 'NHS' the sun came out. It was meant to be."" Ellie Lacey running on Rhossili beach On the first anniversary of her transplant last month,Ellie appealed to the governmentsin England and Scotland to follow Wales' lead and move to an opt out system of organ donation. In Wales everyone is deemed to be willing to donate their organs unless they have opted out.

Manchester hospitals cancel operations,"Manchester Royal Infirmary is one of the hospitals affected Operations were cancelled at four hospitals in Manchester due to a mains leak affecting the water supply. Hospitals affected by Sunday's leak were the Royal Infirmary, the Royal Eye Hospital, Saint Mary's Hospital and Royal Manchester Children's Hospital. Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust said non-urgent operations were cancelled this morning but resumed this afternoon as the supply was restored. An affected patient's grandson took 200 bottles of water to help ill patients. The trust said cancelled operations will be rescheduled as soon as possible. One patient tweeted about the effects on patients, calling it a ""shocking situation"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Prof Cheryl Lenney, director of infection prevention and control for the trust, said: ""Our sterile services require a significant amount of water to sterilise instruments, so it's really important that we knew that the water supply to that department was functioning properly."" She said on Sunday water tanks ""had reached critical levels"" and the hospital implemented water-saving actions including using hand washing gel and wipes and asking patients not to flush the toilet for a short time. Writing on Facebook, Anne Marie O'Toole said: ""I was at children's a & e this evening, the staff were professional, courteous, apologetic and very kind.

Gerry Adams backs Jeremy Corbyn as next PM,"Gerry Adams gave a wide-ranging interview to the Andrew Marr show The outgoing Sinn FÃ©in leader Gerry Adams has praised Jeremy Corbyn and said he would like to see him become the next prime minister. He was speaking to the BBC's Andrew Marr as he enters his final week as president of the party he has led for almost 35 years. He said Mr Corbyn was an ""outstanding politician"" and that he and Ken Livingstone ""kept faith"". He also said he still believes a deal can be reached to restore Stormont. Profile: Gerry Adams Mr Adams repeated his party's belief that Brexit would be disastrous for the island of Ireland. The 69-year-old is due to step down as Sinn FÃ©in leader next weekend, when he will be replaced by Mary Lou McDonald. He is one of the most recognisable and controversial figures in Irish politics and his departure marks a generational shift in the party's leadership. During the Troubles, Gerry Adams was criticised for publicly justifying IRA murders Speaking on BBC One's The Andrew Marr show, Mr Adams praised Mr Corbyn's approach to negotiations in the early days of the Northern Ireland peace process. Mr Corbyn and shadow chancellor John McDonnell have both faced criticism over their past dealings with Sinn FÃ©in, including their decision to meet the party at Westminster in the 1990s, before the IRA ceasefire. During last year's general electionMr Corbyn condemned the IRA's bombing campaign, after coming under pressure to distance himself from the group's activities. On Sunday, Mr Adams said: ""I would like to see Jeremy in that position [prime minister] for the benefit of people in Britain, leaving Ireland out of it. ""I think Jeremy is an outstanding politician and I hope my endorsement of him is not used against him in the time ahead. ""He and (former London Mayor) Ken Livingstone and others kept faith and they were the people who said, when others said no, talk. Gerry Adams helped to negotiate the St Andrews Agreement, leading to a once unthinkable political deal involving the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in ""They were the people who were open to conversation about how to deal with conflict and how to get conflict resolution processes."" Mr Adams' legacy as Sinn FÃ©in leader will sharply divide opinion. He has always denied being a member of the Irish Republican Army (IRA), but to many people, he is a hate figure who publicly justified murders carried out by the group during more than 30 years of the Troubles in Northern Ireland. Others have hailed him as a peacemaker, for leading the republican movement away from its long, violent campaign towards peaceful and democratic means. During the interview, he told Andrew Marr:  ""I would wish that no-one had been killed or injured in the course of the conflict. ""We were able to come to an alternative. When you come forward with an alternative, sensible people will embrace that alternative."" Asked why he did not join the IRA when he was growing up in Belfast, Mr Adams replied: ""I've never distanced myself from the IRA."" He said: ""I did defend the IRA but I also was very critical of what the IRA did at times. The Birmingham pub bombings were wrong, I condemned that as well."" Mr Adams added:  ""You can only make moral judgements about people when you walk in their shoes."" Looking back on the violence, he said: ""Even if it is accidental, how could anyone stand over the killing of a child or a civilian? ""In the awfulness and horror of war, you cannot stand over those incidents."" Asked by Mr Marr if he was a man of faith, he said that he was. ""The one thing I know about Jesus is that he forgave, he didn't go around condemning,"" he said. ""Treat people with dignity and people will respond in a dignified way; treat people badly and people will respond badly."" Mr Adams said he believed power sharing at Stormont could be restored. ""I've every confidence in Michelle O'Neill (Sinn FÃ©in's Stormont leader) in terms of her ability to make friends with the unionists and to go forward on the basis of equality,"" he said. The Sinn FÃ©in leader said some unionists held ""very hard positions"", but others lived in the ""real world"". ""They know they have to make friends with their neighbours and would have to go on. It is not about us any more, it is about the next generation.""

The two fatalities were both members of Amtrak staff, South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster has confirmed. He said the incident - the latest in a series in recent years - should trigger a national debate about rail safety. Just four days ago,a lorry driver was killed when his vehicle hit a train carrying lawmakersin Virginia. The South Carolina crash happened at 02:35 local time (07:35 GMT) in the town of Cayce, just outside the state capital Columbia. The train was travelling from New York and heading for Miami, when it hit the goods train, causing its lead engine and several carriages to derail. Governor McMaster said it appeared the Amtrak train had been on the wrong track at the time of the crash. Officials are trying to find out what led to the collision The American Red Cross sent rescue workers to the scene of the collision, and emergency services say all passengers have been evacuated from the train. Mr McMaster said 116 people were taken to hospital for treatment. An emergency official earlier told reporters the injuries ranged in severity from small scratches to broken bones.

England hammer Italy in Six Nations,"Six Nations Italy (10) 15 Tries:Benvenuti, BelliniCon:AllanPen:Allan England (17) 46 Tries:Watson 2, Farrell, Simmonds 2, Ford, NowellCons:Farrell 4Pen:Farrell England started and finished in style as they overcame a spirited Italy to begin their Six Nations title defence with a seven-try romp. Two early tries from Anthony Watson set Eddie Jones's men on their way, Owen Farrell adding another after Tommaso Benvenuti's inspired try had narrowed the gap. Mattia Bellini's score in the corner midway through the second half meant Italy had fought back to within 12 points with 20 minutes to go. But a brace from Six Nations debutant Sam Simmonds plus sweetly worked tries from George Ford and Jack Nowell allowed the reigning champions to pull away. It means Jones's side have now won 23 of his 24 matches in charge, picking up a bonus point to match the achievements of their next opponents Wales the day before. Conor O'Shea will have seen much to convince him his Italy side are improving in his second year, but it is still a 13th consecutive Six Nations defeat for the tournament's perennial strugglers. Anthony Watson's first-half double set England on their way to victory in Rome Read more: Telepathic Ford and Farrell take partnership to new heights Youngs set to miss Wales match - Jones In the corresponding fixture a year ago England had begun slowly, a flaw that dogged them throughout the championship, but here they began with pace and precision. On three minutes Ben Te'o, starting at outside centre, crashed the ball up into the Italian midfield to create the space for Ford and Farrell to work a wrap-around on the Italian 22. Ford sent May into space down the right and the left winger put Watson over in the corner. The same combination brought dividends again eight minutes later, this time May crashing through one tackle before Watson handed off Tommaso Boni and bounced off Tommaso Benvenuti's no-arms tackle to touch down inside the corner flag once more. Had Farrell not missed both conversions the damage to home morale would have been worse. Instead Conor O'Shea's men responded impressively - Boni and Mattia Bellini combining at pace down the left wing, the forwards securing quick ball and fly-half Tomasso Allen firing a long pass over May to set Benvenuti free down the right. Allen's conversion made it 10-7, only for England to hit back immediately. Danny Care, on early for the injured Ben Youngs, went down the blindside from a ruck 15 metres out and Ford, standing flat to the line, found Farrell on his outside shoulder for the inside-centre's sixth try for his country. Italy had missed 10 tackles in the first 35 minutes, but with Allen landing a penalty late in the half were delighted to be only 17-10 down at the break. Number eight Sam Simmonds marked his Six Nations debut with a superb display. He was England's leading tackler - but the 23-year-old also made the most metres and clean breaks, beat the most defenders and made the joint-most carries, as well as matching Anthony Watson with two tries Another slick backs move appeared to have brought them closer still early in the second half, only for the noisy home contingent in the Stadio Olympico to be silenced when Boni's try was ruled out for a forward pass from Allen. Instead it was England who struck at the other end. Sam Simmonds was left alone off a driving maul to scamper unencumbered under the posts, and what might have been a three-point game was instead a 17-point lead. Italy could have folded, but Bellini held off Mike Brown from another fine long mis-pass from Allen for a deserved second try. This was a different Italy, an invention and cutting edge in the backs to match the traditional muscle up front. And there was relief in the visitors' ranks when Ford put the game to bed when he ran on to Farrell's break to cross for England's fifth try. Simmonds put the seal on it with a second try to mark his tournament debut, showcasing his acceleration and pace to scythe through a tired blue-shirted rearguard before the Exeter man's no-look pass put his club team-mate Nowell away for one his own at the death. For all the talk of Ben Te'o's selection - and Sam Simmonds' impact - it was England inside centre Farrell whose breaks and passing were the catalyst for his side's victory Italy:Minozzi; Benvenuti, Boni, Castello, Bellini; Allan, Violi; Lovotti, Ghiraldini, Ferrari, Zanni, Budd, Negri, Giammarioli, Parisse.

Joint Korean ice hockey team loses,"The athletes of Team Korea in action against Sweden The joint North and South Korean women's ice hockey team has lost its first match - a friendly against Sweden - before the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics in South Korea. The Swedish women's team beat their Korean counterparts 3-1. The unified Korean team will get a chance to even the score when they face Sweden again during the Games, which start next Friday. Sunday's outing was the first and only practice match for the Korean squad. Hours later, South Korean officials said that the North's ceremonial head of state, Kim Yong-nam, would visit the South for the start of the Games at the head of a 22-member delegation. The combined ice hockey team was formed after the two Koreas reached a controversial deal to compete under the same flag. A BBC correspondent at the game said the crowd went wild, although there had been a small protest against the fielding of a joint team outside the arena. The move had proved unpopular with some in the South, who believe the late inclusion of North Korean players will jeopardise their chances of a medal. Korean fans cheer, waving the Unification Flag designed to represent both North and South North Korea's participation in the Olympics, which run from 9 to 25 February, has been interpreted as a show of reconciliation. It comes at a time of heightened tensions over the North's nuclear ambitions, following a series of missile tests designed to demonstrate its nuclear capability.

MLA car clamp removal reported to police,"This video can not be played Sinn FÃ©in's Gerry Kelly was filmed removing a car clamp Sinn FÃ©in's Gerry Kelly has been interviewed by police for alleged criminal damage after he was filmed removing a clamp from his car. The North Belfast MLA wasrecorded using what appears to be bolt cutters to remove the clamp on Friday. In a tweet on Sunday evening, Mr Kelly said: ""No one can be above the law."" He said he had made a ""voluntary arrangement"" to talk to police. Footage of the incident was posted on social media. His actions were criticised by other political parties. Stormontgate. Namagate. Clampgate? In his tweet, Mr Kelly said he wanted to resolve the matter ""as soon as possible"". Earlier, police confirmed they had interviewed a 64-year-old man at Musgrave Park police station in relation to an allegation of criminal damage at Exchange Street in Belfast on Friday.

DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds said this was a ""significant test for the Sinn FÃ©in leadership"". On Saturday, Sinn FÃ©in said the matter was being dealt with by Mr Kelly's solicitor. Sinn FÃ©in said Mr Kelly removed the clamp ""after an early morning gym session"" The incident happened near the Metropolitan Arts Centre (MAC). The clamp was fitted by a private company called Parking and Enforcement Agency (PEA). Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Its spokesman told theBelfast Telegraph,external: ""PEA is aware of this incident and has reported the matter to the PSNI as we do in all such cases."" Mr Kelly is also Sinn FÃ©in's policing spokesperson. He is also a former member of the Northern Ireland Policing Board, which holds the PSNI to account. Footage of the incident was posted on social media Mr Dodds, DUP, asked: ""Will Gerry Adams, Mary Lou McDonald or Michelle O'Neill finally take action when we have their policing spokesperson act like this? ""Nobody's holding their breath."" Clamping in Northern Ireland The Department for Infrastructure (DfI) is responsible for the enforcement of most parking restrictions. Clamping and removal are used when parking tickets have not been paid. But the department has no responsibility when it comes to private land, such as a retail park, hospital or supermarket. Landowners can set their own rules and hire firms to police their parking restrictions. When it comes to clamping and towing on private land, Northern Ireland is out on its own. The Protection of Freedoms Act outlawed the practice in England and Wales in 2012. It has been banned in Scotland since 1992. But in Gerry Kelly's case, there is another law at play - the Criminal Damage (Northern Ireland) Order 1977, which means you cannot damage other people's property ""without lawful excuse"". Clamping and criminal damage has been tested in the courts elsewhere. In 1991, a motorist in England was found guilty of causing criminal damage to property after he forcibly removed a clamp from his car in a private car park. His defence was that he had a lawful excuse for cutting the padlocks in that wheel-clamping was a trespass to his car, and under the principle of the ""recaption of goods"" he was entitled to recover his car. However, a year later, a Scottish appeal court called clamping ""extortion and theft"". ""The act of depriving the motorist of the use of his car by detaining it against his will can accurately be described as stealing something from him,"" one of the judges said. Mr Dodds said that Sinn FÃ©in ""preach"" respect and equality, but this incident suggested otherwise. Sinn FÃ©in's Mary Lou McDonald, who will take over the party leadership next weekend, said she did not know enough about the incident to comment. Speaking to RTÃ on Sunday morning, she said: ""Gerry's solicitors are currently dealing with the issue of the clamping. ""I have to tell you that I don't have the detail on it and we'll have to see what flows from that, but I'm reluctant to comment any further because I don't have the facts of exactly what happened. Mary Lou McDonald said she did not know enough about the incident to comment ""I'm only in a position to say that his solicitors are dealing with the issue, as they should,"" she added. The leader of the Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) party, Jim Allister, criticised Mr Kelly on BBC Radio Ulster. ""He, who sat in the Policing Board, pontificating about law and order issues, should now think that he can take the law into his own hands and behave in this manner needs to be called to account. ""Not just in respect of the criminal law, in regard to criminal damage, but in respect of public representation, by being removed as a public representative."" Mr Kelly's car was in a ""no parking"" area Ulster Unionist MLA Roy Beggs said Mr Kelly had set ""an appalling example"" and should ""do the decent thing and resign"". ""Parking in a no-parking area, which reserves access for deliveries and emergencies, then damaging private property. ""What if everyone ignored yellow lines? ""Is Gerry special, above the rules that apply to you and me?"" Mr Beggs added: ""If this was to happen in any other part of the United Kingdom or indeed the Republic, the relevant politician would be gone."" Alliance MLA Paula Bradshaw said Mr Kelly's actions were ""ironic"" given that he was Sinn FÃ©in's spokesperson on justice issues. ""This is the sort of stuff that reflects very much on the behaviour of MLAs and I would very much like the assembly back up and running this week so that this could be looked at as an internal matter in terms of his conduct as a public representative.""

A year off for knob throwers,"Knob-throwing has been a Dorset pastime since 2008 An annual knob-throwing festival has been cancelled for 2018 and could become a biennial event, organisers have said. The competition to hurl the traditional local Dorset biscuits the furthest distance has been running since 2008. Knobmaker Moores Biscuits recently told organisers the event had ""run its course"" but had since changed its mind, festival chairman Ian Gregory said. The firm said the event would come back ""bigger and better"" in 2019. The competition incorporates a food festival, as well as games such as knob and spoon racing and pinning the knob on the Cerne Abbas giant. More than 4,000 people attended the event in 2017, when it moved from Cattistock to Kingston Maurward House near Dorchester. Other games at the festival include pin the knob on the Cerne Giant Mr Gregory said the cancellation of the event scheduled for May was caused by several factors including the retirement of long-serving committee members and Moores Biscuits' stance. He said the festival might switch to being held every two years ""to give it more oomph"". David Winship, a partner at Moores Biscuits, said: ""We've been doing it for 10 years. It's not formulaic but it's much the same year after year and I think the cancellation was right."" In the 2017 competition, Pete Asher threw his biscuit the furthestin the rainy conditions with an effort of 22.70m (74.4ft) The biscuits have been made by Moores of Morecombelake for more than 150 years Originally they were made from leftover bread dough with added butter and sugar, hand-rolled and left to dry in the dying heat of the oven It is thought their name comes from the hand-sewn Dorset knob buttons that were also made locally They can be eaten with Blue Vinny cheese, dipped in tea or cider, or taken with honey and cream - known locally as thunder and lightning Knob-throwing contest held at new venue Thousands attend knob throwing contest Thousands turn out for knob-throwing Thousands gather for knob throwing Dorset Knob Throwing & Food Festival Moores Biscuits Warning of snow  in place across Dorset Person found dead at property in Poole Christchurch's Meram Kitchen reaches semi-finals of British Kebab Awards Nearly Â£2,000 worth of cigarettes and tobacco stolen from shop Firefighters running out of water as wildfire declared most destructive in LA's history In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?

Crematorium alert over exploding coconut,"Bolton council has warned people against placing items in coffins as they can cause ""a hell of an explosion"" during cremation A coconut that was placed inside a coffin ""sent fear"" through staff at a crematorium when it exploded. Bolton Council has urged mourners to abide by crematorium rules and not ""slip"" items into coffins. Donna Ball, Assistant Director of Community Services, said a ""hell of an explosion can sometimes occur"". Other items of concern include mobile phones, TV remotes, e-cigarettes and bottles of alcohol. Sprawling Maya cities uncovered by lasers Airlines probed over seating policy Jack Whitehall regrets lewd Queen joke Ms Ball told the BBC: ""We are asking people to be considerate regarding the items they place into coffins before the cremation process. ""We have seen a rise in things like e-cigarettes, bottles of whisky and vodka, golf balls, sometimes golf clubs, and mobile phones. Mobile phones in particular are a real issue for us"". Love letters, cigarettes and extra underwear were amongst the banned items mourners requested to place with their loved ones Ms Ball said: ""Usually the funeral director will pick them up but sometimes things are slid inside peoples' pockets and they are just not picked up during the process, then when they go through the cremation process a hell of an explosion can sometimes occur"". She added that electrical items with batteries also push crematorium emissions up to ""unacceptable levels"". Louise Walch-Grognet, of Fred Hamer Funeral Services, said they check the coffins to make sure contraband items are not slipped in. ""They've asked can they put love letters in, cigarettes, ashes of their pets,"" she said. ""I've had a biker whose family wanted him to wear his leathers. Obviously we couldn't do that"". The funeral director said on one occasion she was even asked if an extra set of underwear could be placed with the deceased. Ms Walch-Grognet said it was her procedure to ""look under the lining of the coffin"" after the service due to mourners trying to sneak items in.

Biscuits and chocolates take the 'shrinkflation' test,"Many of the nation's favourite treats are getting smaller, but BBC research has found that some prices are falling too. Chocoholics and biscuit-lovers have been outraged in recent years by news of so-called ""shrinkflation"". That is when food manufacturers reduce the weight of their products without shrinking the price. So with the traditional January detox over, and many Britons reaching for a sweet snack, we have looked at whether the customer always loses out. We analysed 19 products over the last four years from high street chains Asda, Ocado/Waitrose, Sainsburys and Tesco. The figures reveal that 18 of the 19 products have been slimmed down. Five products hit by shrinkflation Jaffa quake as McVitie's cuts pack sizes More than 2,500 products subject to shrinkflation, says ONS Manufacturers often blame the rising cost of ingredients. Mondelez International, which makes Toblerone, said it had carried the costs for ""as long as possible"" before deciding to make their triangles further apart. Nestle said it had reduced weights sometimes to reduce calories or bring manufacturing in different countries into line. Others point to exchange rates, in other words how their buying power has been hit by falls in the value of the pound. But whether it is the ingredients, exchange rates, or saving us from obesity and bad teeth, all manufacturers insist that they give customers value for money. The price of a product is driven by all kinds of factors such as packaging, transport and marketing which might not change with alterations in weight. We have looked at price in two ways - price per 100g and actual price paid at the checkout per pack or bar. Four of our 19 products have got cheaper per 100g, while others have risen sharply. But many consumers will be concerned simply with the price they pay at the checkout per pack or bar. The data here shows more price drops but clearly these are not always in proportion to weight reductions. In total, nine of our 19 products had gone down in price per pack. Manufacturers know that keeping their products affordable is important. So while the ""shrink"" is overwhelming, the ""flation"" (raising prices by stealth) is happening... not quite so much. Produced by David Brown, Daniele Palumbo, Mark Bryson and Luke Keast. About the data:19 products were selected for which there was consistent price and weight data over a four year period from January 2014 to 25th January 2018. The data shown represent an average of the shelf price data provided by companies. Data supplied by Brand View.

Bodies pulled from sea off Morocco,"A maritime rescue boat in the Mediterranean (file picture) The bodies of 16 people have been pulled from the sea off the coast of Melilla, a small Spanish territory bordering Morocco. Moroccan rescue services recovered the corpses after the crew of a Spanish ship spotted them in the water. A medical official told AFP news agency all the dead were from sub-Saharan Africa, apart from one Moroccan. It is thought they may have been hoping to reach Europe by sailing from Melilla, despite storm warnings. Melilla, which is just 12 sq km (7 square miles), is a major crossing point for undocumented migrants seeking work or asylum in Europe. It is one of only two EU land borders with Africa - the other being a second Spanish enclave, Ceuta. Profile: Melilla and Ceuta Melilla's migrants: On a hill, in sight of Europe The bodies were found floating on Saturday around 6-8km from Melilla's coast, Spanish newspaper El Pais reports,external(in Spanish). A spokeswoman for Melilla's authorities said earlier that ""about 20"" bodies had been retrieved. The exact death toll has not yet been confirmed. Spanish rescue services resumed a search on Sunday morning. The sea crossing between North Africa and southern Spain is increasingly favoured by migrants, according to the International Organization for Migration (IOM). So far in 2018, Spain has been the second most popular entry point for incomers to Europe. IOM figures say some 1,279 arrived there, while 4,256 went to Italy. Not including those recovered this weekend, at least 243 migrants have already died or gone missing this year after trying to cross the Mediterranean. A note on terminology:The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries such as Syria, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants.

Profile: Melilla and Ceuta Melilla's migrants: On a hill, in sight of Europe The bodies were found floating on Saturday around 6-8km from Melilla's coast, Spanish newspaper El Pais reports,external(in Spanish). A spokeswoman for Melilla's authorities said earlier that ""about 20"" bodies had been retrieved. The exact death toll has not yet been confirmed. Spanish rescue services resumed a search on Sunday morning. The sea crossing between North Africa and southern Spain is increasingly favoured by migrants, according to the International Organization for Migration (IOM). So far in 2018, Spain has been the second most popular entry point for incomers to Europe. IOM figures say some 1,279 arrived there, while 4,256 went to Italy. Not including those recovered this weekend, at least 243 migrants have already died or gone missing this year after trying to cross the Mediterranean. A note on terminology:The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries such as Syria, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants.

Jack Whitehall 'regrets lewd Queen joke',"Whitehall has worked with his father Michael on a number of TV shows Comedian Jack Whitehall has said he regrets making a crass joke about the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh. Appearing on BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs he recalled his remark about a bladder infection on Channel 4's Big Fat Quiz Of The Year in 2012. Whitehall said he upset his family and is now a ""lot more careful"" about what he says and ""self-censor[s] more"". He said: ""I have a relatively thick skin but I never wanted to drag them into it"". He said that after he made the joke, in a pre-recorded episode of the quiz show, he was on the front of newspapers ""every day for a week"". ""That was not nice, because it was something I'd said that caused them upset and that was the bit that hurt the most,"" he added. Uma Thurman breaks silence on Weinstein attack US House speaker deletes tax cuts tweet Lady Gaga halt tours due to 'severe pain' The 29-year-old told presenter Kirsty Young that in the early stages of his career he did not give his family the ""best version"" of himself. Whitehall's relationship with his father, Michael, has been highlighted by joint ventures in the TV shows Backchat and Travels With My Father. But he insists the more tender moments on-screen can never really be planned. ""We don't really talk about our emotions as a family, we're not necessarily very good at that, but it's amazing."" Whitehall admitted the nature of his work meant spending time with relatives was sometimes sacrificed. ""I got very bad at it. I'd come to life when on a show and I'd be upbeat and fun, and when I was with [my family], I was kind of twitchy and on edge and anxious about work. ""And then I took a conscious effort, I was like, I need to spend more time with them and be careful that I never do that and never take them for advantage, because I'm so close to my family, and they're so supportive."" He told the programme it upset him when people would suggest his success was down to his father's career as a celebrity agent. ""To become a stand-up comedian, the fact that my dad used to look after Christopher Biggins doesn't necessarily help you get stage time. ""That's the bit that needles me, and now I've said it people will needle with me more!""

Twenty bodies pulled from sea near Morocco,"A maritime rescue boat in the Mediterranean (file picture) The bodies of 16 people have been pulled from the sea off the coast of Melilla, a small Spanish territory bordering Morocco. Moroccan rescue services recovered the corpses after the crew of a Spanish ship spotted them in the water. A medical official told AFP news agency all the dead were from sub-Saharan Africa, apart from one Moroccan. It is thought they may have been hoping to reach Europe by sailing from Melilla, despite storm warnings.

Mass Greek protest over Macedonia nameHundreds of thousands gather in Athens to urge the government not to back down.29m29 minutes agoEurope,"Protesters from far and wide, including some from other countries - flooded Syntagma Square in Athens Tens of thousands of Greeks have taken to the streets of Athens in a protest about the decades-long dispute over the name Macedonia. Police said some 140,000 people joined the rally, but organisers put the turnout closer to 1.5 million people. Many Greeks object to the country of the same name calling itself Macedonia, saying it implies a territorial claim on Greece's northern Macedonia region. Protesters oppose Greek government proposals on resolving the issue. Celebrated Zorba The Greek composer Mikis Theodorakis, 92, was among those addressing the crowds. Anarchists daubed red paint over his home on Saturday but he was unfazed, declaring, ""I am calm and ready."" The man who has focused on one word for 23 years What's in a name? Macedonia country profile Demonstrators carrying Greek flags chanted ""hands off Macedonia"" and ""Macedonia is Greece"", as they assembled in Syntagma Square outside parliament. Mr Theodorakis urged the crowds to hold out for an acceptable solution to the dispute with the ""Skopjans"", as he termed the northern neighbour ""Macedonia was, is and will forever be Greek,"" Mr Theodorakis told the huge crowds, adding that any suggestion of a name to resolve the dispute must be put to a referendum. ""If a government considers signing on behalf of our country... there is no doubt it must first ask the Greek people."" He said the neighbouring northern state was ""illegitimate"". Greek Foreign Minister Nikos Kotzias recently received death threats when he said he expected the dispute to be resolved within months. It is the second such protest inside two weeks ""Here are the borders,"" said protester Rania Mainou from Xanthi in northern Greece. ""This is Macedonia. Here, these are Slavs, they are not Macedonians, we are Macedonians. Macedonia is Greek, no one can take this name, no one can use it."" It is the second such protest in a fortnight. Some 90,000 demonstrators rallied in Thessaloniki, the capital of the Macedonia region, on 21 January. The dispute has simmered since Macedonia gained independence from Yugoslavia in 1991 and it has held up its attempts to join Nato and the EU. Greece's left-wing Syriza government says the issue is a diplomatic obstacle it wants resolved and has proposed agreeing to a composite name for the country which would include the word Macedonia but ensure a clear differentiation from the Greek region. For many people in Macedonia, this name is the logical option because of a geographical connection with the ancient kingdom of Macedon, once ruled by Alexander the Great. However, the identity and origins of the people of Macedonia are the subject of heated historical debate. Prime Minister Zoran Zaev said last month that Macedonia would change the name of its airport from Skopje Alexander the Great airport, to show good will. The Greek Orthodox Church backs the campaign to stop Macedonia using any variant of the name. In organisations such as the UN, where talks have been under way, the country is officially known as the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) At home, the Macedonian government calls the country it administers simply ""Republic of Macedonia"". UN mediator Matthew Nimetz has suggested alternatives such as ""Republic of New Macedonia"". A proposal to name it ""Republic of Macedonia-Skopje"" was reportedly accepted by Greece but rejected by Macedonia.

"PM vows to tackle political intimidationTheresa May will consider new legislation to protect candidates, 100 years after women got the vote.2h2 hours agoUK Politics","The prime minister is set to announce a crackdown on the intimidation of political candidates, 100 years after some women got the vote. Theresa May will make an appeal for ""tolerance and respect"" and say it is unacceptable for anyone to face threats over their political view. She will consider a new offence to protect politicians and their families. Areport,externalpreviously found women, ethnic minority and gay candidates were most likely to be targets of abuse.

The Representation of the People Act, passed on 6 February 1918, gave the vote to women over the age of 30 and ""of property"". But 100 years on, the prime minister will say political discussion is becoming harder to have without resulting in ""tribalism and rancour"". While British democracy is ""robust and oppositional"", Mrs May will say a line has been crossed when disagreement turns to intimidation.

""The organised groups tend to be Britain First, the EDL, who are very threatening,"" she said. One comment she received read: ""I want to see your head swinging from Tower Bridge."" Ms Smith said there was ""absolutely no doubt"" female MPs received more abuse - particularly those from black and ethnic minority backgrounds. She wrote letter to Conservative Party chairman Sir Patrick McLoughlin, accusing the party of ""propagating personal attacks, smears and untruths"".

Marine cuts would 'undermine UK security',"This video can not be played Defence Select Committee chairman Julian Lewis explains why the Navy's landing ships are a ""world-beating capability"" Cutting the number of Royal Marines and the ships they use to carry out beach landings would significantly undermine UK security, MPs have warned. A government review which began last yearhas proposed axing up to 2,000 marines and the Royal Navy's two specialist landing ships. Buta Commons Defence Select Committee report,externalsaid such cuts would be ""militarily illiterate"". A MoD spokesman said ""protecting the UK will always be our priority"". Reality Check: What's happening to defence spending? Five questions on defence spending Royal Navy could lose 'fight on beaches' The Tory-led committee's strongly worded report - called Sunset for the Royal Marines? - warns the rumoured cuts would weaken one of Britain's elite fighting forces. ""Given the disproportionate contribution the Royal Marines make to defence and the sheer range and versatility of their military skills, both they and the country's security would be significantly undermined,"" they said. They also said slashing its two amphibious assault ships HMS Albion and HMS Bulwark - used to carry out beach landings - would ""put the interests of this country at serious risk"". The former head of the Royal Navy, Lord West, said the UK's ""capability will have been cut by a half"" since 2010 if the cuts go ahead. ""I don't think the British people realise what cuts the military have had,"" he said. HMS Bulwark was involved in migrant rescue missions in the central Mediterranean Theresa May and Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson are understood to have both rejected the cost-cutting proposals before Christmas, but concern over funding remains. Last month, Mr Williamson announced a new review, the Defence Modernisation Programme, focusing solely on military defence. Mr Williamson has indicated he will demand more money if the review deems it necessary. ""Gavin Williamson deserves credit for seizing back control of the defence dimension of the NSCR (National Security Capability Review) process,"" said Defence Select Committee chair Julian Lewis. ""But, ultimately, he will fail without extra funding from the Treasury."" If the ships were lost ""the heart would be torn out of our amphibious capability"", Mr Lewis added. The Tory MP told the BBC: ""The Treasury has got to cough up."" In December,analysis by the House of Commons Library,externalfound that between 2010 and 2015 the Ministry of Defence's (MoD) budget had fallen by Â£8bn in real terms. Since then, spending has stabilised and in the last financial year (April 2016 - March 2017), Â£35.3bn was spent on defence. In 2016, the UK had the fifth biggest defence budget  - the highest of all EU countries - according to an international militarystudy,external. Mr Lewis added that recent years had seen ""new and intensified threats"" and the UK should not be ""deleting one of our world-beating capabilities"". The MPs' report also said cuts to the Royal Marines since 2011 had already led to ""a tangible drop in morale"" and ""particular embarrassment"" during exercises with the UK's allies. In response to the report, a Ministry of Defence spokesman said the Royal Marines ""play a vital role"" in defending the country. ""Just last week we launched the Modernising Defence Programme to strengthen our Armed Forces in the face of intensifying threats,"" he said. ""Our brand new aircraft carrier, HMS Queen Elizabeth, is central to our efforts to build an Armed Forces fit for the future and is a symbol of our intent to remain a truly Global Britain."" The Â£3.1bn HMS Queen Elizabeth was unveiled in 2017. It laterreported leaksduring its first sea trial.

Two dead in S Carolina train collision,"This video can not be played The crash happened in the early hours of Sunday morning An Amtrak train carrying 147 people has collided with a goods train in the US state of South Carolina, killing two people and injuring 116 others. The two fatalities were both members of Amtrak staff, South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster has confirmed. He said the incident - the latest in a series in recent years - should trigger a national debate about rail safety. Just four days ago,a lorry driver was killed when his vehicle hit a train carrying lawmakersin Virginia. The South Carolina crash happened at 02:35 local time (07:35 GMT) in the town of Cayce, just outside the state capital Columbia. The train was travelling from New York and heading for Miami, when it hit the goods train, causing its lead engine and several carriages to derail. Governor McMaster said it appeared the Amtrak train had been on the wrong track at the time of the crash. Officials are trying to find out what led to the collision The American Red Cross sent rescue workers to the scene of the collision, and emergency services say all passengers have been evacuated from the train. Mr McMaster said 116 people were taken to hospital for treatment. An emergency official earlier told reporters the injuries ranged in severity from small scratches to broken bones. A shelter has been set up at a nearby school for passengers to get assistance. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Car clamp removal reported to police,"This video can not be played Sinn FÃ©in's Gerry Kelly was filmed removing a car clamp Sinn FÃ©in's Gerry Kelly has been interviewed by police for alleged criminal damage after he was filmed removing a clamp from his car. The North Belfast MLA wasrecorded using what appears to be bolt cutters to remove the clamp on Friday. In a tweet on Sunday evening, Mr Kelly said: ""No one can be above the law."" He said he had made a ""voluntary arrangement"" to talk to police. Footage of the incident was posted on social media. His actions were criticised by other political parties. Stormontgate. Namagate. Clampgate? In his tweet, Mr Kelly said he wanted to resolve the matter ""as soon as possible"". Earlier, police confirmed they had interviewed a 64-year-old man at Musgrave Park police station in relation to an allegation of criminal damage at Exchange Street in Belfast on Friday.

DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds said this was a ""significant test for the Sinn FÃ©in leadership"". On Saturday, Sinn FÃ©in said the matter was being dealt with by Mr Kelly's solicitor. Sinn FÃ©in said Mr Kelly removed the clamp ""after an early morning gym session"" The incident happened near the Metropolitan Arts Centre (MAC). The clamp was fitted by a private company called Parking and Enforcement Agency (PEA). Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Its spokesman told theBelfast Telegraph,external: ""PEA is aware of this incident and has reported the matter to the PSNI as we do in all such cases."" Mr Kelly is also Sinn FÃ©in's policing spokesperson. He is also a former member of the Northern Ireland Policing Board, which holds the PSNI to account. Footage of the incident was posted on social media Mr Dodds, DUP, asked: ""Will Gerry Adams, Mary Lou McDonald or Michelle O'Neill finally take action when we have their policing spokesperson act like this? ""Nobody's holding their breath."" Clamping in Northern Ireland The Department for Infrastructure (DfI) is responsible for the enforcement of most parking restrictions. Clamping and removal are used when parking tickets have not been paid. But the department has no responsibility when it comes to private land, such as a retail park, hospital or supermarket. Landowners can set their own rules and hire firms to police their parking restrictions. When it comes to clamping and towing on private land, Northern Ireland is out on its own. The Protection of Freedoms Act outlawed the practice in England and Wales in 2012. It has been banned in Scotland since 1992. But in Gerry Kelly's case, there is another law at play - the Criminal Damage (Northern Ireland) Order 1977, which means you cannot damage other people's property ""without lawful excuse"". Clamping and criminal damage has been tested in the courts elsewhere. In 1991, a motorist in England was found guilty of causing criminal damage to property after he forcibly removed a clamp from his car in a private car park. His defence was that he had a lawful excuse for cutting the padlocks in that wheel-clamping was a trespass to his car, and under the principle of the ""recaption of goods"" he was entitled to recover his car. However, a year later, a Scottish appeal court called clamping ""extortion and theft"". ""The act of depriving the motorist of the use of his car by detaining it against his will can accurately be described as stealing something from him,"" one of the judges said. Mr Dodds said that Sinn FÃ©in ""preach"" respect and equality, but this incident suggested otherwise. Sinn FÃ©in's Mary Lou McDonald, who will take over the party leadership next weekend, said she did not know enough about the incident to comment. Speaking to RTÃ on Sunday morning, she said: ""Gerry's solicitors are currently dealing with the issue of the clamping. ""I have to tell you that I don't have the detail on it and we'll have to see what flows from that, but I'm reluctant to comment any further because I don't have the facts of exactly what happened. Mary Lou McDonald said she did not know enough about the incident to comment ""I'm only in a position to say that his solicitors are dealing with the issue, as they should,"" she added. The leader of the Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) party, Jim Allister, criticised Mr Kelly on BBC Radio Ulster. ""He, who sat in the Policing Board, pontificating about law and order issues, should now think that he can take the law into his own hands and behave in this manner needs to be called to account. ""Not just in respect of the criminal law, in regard to criminal damage, but in respect of public representation, by being removed as a public representative."" Mr Kelly's car was in a ""no parking"" area Ulster Unionist MLA Roy Beggs said Mr Kelly had set ""an appalling example"" and should ""do the decent thing and resign"". ""Parking in a no-parking area, which reserves access for deliveries and emergencies, then damaging private property. ""What if everyone ignored yellow lines? ""Is Gerry special, above the rules that apply to you and me?"" Mr Beggs added: ""If this was to happen in any other part of the United Kingdom or indeed the Republic, the relevant politician would be gone."" Alliance MLA Paula Bradshaw said Mr Kelly's actions were ""ironic"" given that he was Sinn FÃ©in's spokesperson on justice issues. ""This is the sort of stuff that reflects very much on the behaviour of MLAs and I would very much like the assembly back up and running this week so that this could be looked at as an internal matter in terms of his conduct as a public representative.""

First test for joint Korean ice hockey team,"The athletes of Team Korea in action against Sweden The joint North and South Korean women's ice hockey team has lost its first match - a friendly against Sweden - before the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics in South Korea. The Swedish women's team beat their Korean counterparts 3-1. The unified Korean team will get a chance to even the score when they face Sweden again during the Games, which start next Friday. Sunday's outing was the first and only practice match for the Korean squad. Hours later, South Korean officials said that the North's ceremonial head of state, Kim Yong-nam, would visit the South for the start of the Games at the head of a 22-member delegation. The combined ice hockey team was formed after the two Koreas reached a controversial deal to compete under the same flag. A BBC correspondent at the game said the crowd went wild, although there had been a small protest against the fielding of a joint team outside the arena. The move had proved unpopular with some in the South, who believe the late inclusion of North Korean players will jeopardise their chances of a medal. Korean fans cheer, waving the Unification Flag designed to represent both North and South North Korea's participation in the Olympics, which run from 9 to 25 February, has been interpreted as a show of reconciliation. It comes at a time of heightened tensions over the North's nuclear ambitions, following a series of missile tests designed to demonstrate its nuclear capability. N Korea hockey players arrive in the South How good is North Korea at sport? Harley Windsor: The Australian ice skater breaking barriers As well as the ice hockey players, its athletes will compete in skiing and figure skating events. North Korean skaters Ryom Tae-ok (R) and Kim Ju-sik practise in Pyeongchang The North is also sending hundreds of delegates, cheerleaders and performers. Earlier this week it emerged that the North had scheduled a large-scale military parade for 8 February, the day before the Winter Olympics commences.

China derides 'Cold War' US nuclear plan,"The US nuclear force is based on land, sea and air-based weapons China has urged the US to drop its ""Cold War mentality"" after Washington said it planned to diversify its nuclear armoury with smaller bombs. ""The country that owns the world's largest nuclear arsenal, should take the initiative to follow the trend instead of going against it,"" China's defence ministry said on Sunday. The US military believes its nuclear weapons are seen as too big to be used and wants to develop low-yield bombs. Russia has already condemned the plan. Iran's foreign minister claimed it brought the world ""closer to annihilation"". The US is concerned about its nuclear arsenal becoming obsolete and no longer an effective deterrent. It names China, Russia, North Korea and Iran as potential threats. Where are the world's nuclear weapons? The Pentagon document released on Friday, known as the Nuclear Posture Review (NPR), argues that developing smaller nuclear weapons would challenge that assumption. Low-yield weapons with a strength of under 20 kilotons are less powerful but are still devastating. The policy also proposes: Land-based ballistic missiles, submarine-launched missiles, and air-delivered weapons - to be extensively modernised, as begun under ex-President Obama Proposed modification of some submarine-launched nuclear warheads to give a lower-yield or less powerful detonation Return of sea-based nuclear cruise missiles Countering the ""growing threat from revisionist powers"", such as China and Russia, was at the heart ofAmerica's new defence strategy announced last month. China said on Sunday it ""firmly"" opposedthe Pentagon's review of US nuclear policy,external. The defence ministry in Beijing said Washington had played up the threat of China's nuclear threat, adding that its own policy was defensive in nature. ""We hope that the United States will abandon its Cold War mentality, earnestly assume its special disarmament responsibilities, correctly understand China's strategic intentions and objectively view China's national defence and military build-up,"" its statement said. China has used the Cold War label beforeto criticise US policy. Late last year it denounced Washington's updated defence  strategy and urged the US to abandon ""outdated notions"". In the NPR document, the US accused China of ""expanding its already considerable nuclear forces"" but China defended its policy on Sunday saying it would ""resolutely stick to peaceful development and pursue a national defence policy that is defensive in nature"". The Russian foreign ministry accused the US of warmongering, and said it would take ""necessary measures"" to ensure Russian security. ""From first reading, the confrontational and anti-Russian character of this document leaps out at you,"" it said in a statement on Saturday. Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov expressed ""deep disappointment"" at the plan. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif argued the proposals were in violation of the international nuclear non-proliferation treaty.

What the EU really wants from the UK,"Fancy some slideshows about Free Trade Agreements, non-regression clauses and something called EASA? Thought not. During January officials from the 27 remaining EU countries received a series of presentations from the European Commission about ideas for their future relationship with the UK. The slides reveal valuable clues about the EU's thinking ahead of the next phase of talks. I've read them all so that you don't have to. Pressure on May to choose over Brexit Calls to publish Brexit study rejected The key Brexit dates in 2018 To help the two sides manage an industry that catches 100 different types of fish worth Â£625m a year, the EU is mulling over a bespoke fisheries partnership with the UK. It would be based on current and existing fishing patterns. In other words, it might look very similar to the Common Fisheries Policy. The European Commission helpfully pointed out that the EU catches a lot of fish off the British coast and the UK sells a lot of fish to EU consumers, suggesting a link between access to each other's waters and each other's markets. Officials said that the UK could not remain a member of the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and the best it could hope for was a deal similar to those with the USA and Qatar, which would allow British airlines to fly into the EU but not between cities inside the EU. Britain's unconditional commitment to European security has been heard loud and clear. The EU is thinking about an agreement to share classified intelligence. The UK could be invited to join individual projects in the EU's new defence co-operation programme, called PESCO. There was a warning that the fall-back for failing to agree a replacement for the European Arrest Warrant would be a 1950s-era convention on extradition that's much less effective. The EU insists that the UK maintains the same data protection standards and guarantees the human rights of EU citizens when it comes to the fight against cross-border crime. ""Governance"" is the name the EU gives to a mechanism for dealing with future problems in the relationship and the punishments available if one side breaks the rules. The main message here is the more the final deal relies on EU law, then the greater the role for the European Court of Justice (ECJ). Brussels has suggested the ECJ settles disputes with the UK if a Joint Committee of British and European officials can't solve them first. That doesn't fly with the British, so European Commission officials also flagged up the EU's agreement with Ukraine. Ukrainian courts can ask the ECJ for advice, but its rulings could lead to the temporary suspension of sections of the deal with the EU, not changes to the law in Ukraine. This is going to be a huge part of the talks about the future relationship. Also known as the LPF, it is Brussels code for ways to stop the UK undercutting the EU on tax, labour and environmental standards. EU officials admit there are few legal ways they could prevent post-Brexit UK from slashing corporation tax to attract businesses, for example. Does the EU sign a tax co-operation deal like they have with Liechtenstein and Monaco? Do they insist on a written pledge to treat each other nicely? Or do they rely on the threat of the UK one day ending up on the EU's list of tax havens? And officials seemed particularly worried about State Aid - the British government using public money to help sectors of the economy with subsidies or investments. The European Commission says this must be dealt within the Brexit deal because existing international rules aren't enough to cope with a very big, very rich, very close neighbour like the UK. The slides show the EU looking confident in some areas, less so in others. Officials are wading through precedents, but are finding the UK is too big and too close to use off-the-shelf solutions for everything. And now a warning. These are the EU's thoughts about some of the things that will have to be addressed in the negotiations over its future relationship with the UK. It is not the policy for the next phase of Brexit talks. At least, not yet. For that we will have to wait for EU leaders to agree their strategy at a summit in March.

Rudd hits back at Tory Brexiteers,"This video can not be played Amber Rudd says Jacob Rees-Mogg should not have accused Treasury of fiddling figures Home Secretary Amber Rudd has hit back at Tory Brexiteers over attacks on the civil service and claims of disunity. Ms Rudd said backbencher Jacob Rees-Mogg was ""wrong"" to accuse the Treasury of ""fiddling the figures"" with forecasts showing the UK would be worse off outside the EU. The leaked forecast that sparked the row was a cross-departmental ""tool"" to ""help inform the debate"", she said. And she said ministers were more united over Brexit than critics claim. Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr show, she said she was ""not intimidated"" by Brexiteers' warnings over the customs union and that the UK government would not ""surrender too quickly"" in its battle for a ""bespoke"" trade deal with the EU. All you need to know about Brexit What the EU really wants from the UK The key Brexit dates in 2018 Negotiations are taking place between the UK and the EU ahead of the UK's scheduled exit in March 2019. Ahead of a week of key meetings, Theresa May is facing growing calls to set out in detail what she wants to secure - in particular how closely-bound the UK will be to the EU after it leaves. Writing inthe Sunday Telegraph,external,  Bernard Jenkin, a Conservative MP who was a key Leave campaigner, accused the government of being ""vague"" and ""divided"" on the issue. But Ms Rudd told Andrew Marr she had ""a surprise for the Brexiteers"", that the key Brexit committee of ministers was ""more united than they think"". The cabinet agrees on the need for ""frictionless trade"", the ability to strike international trade deals and avoid a hard border in Ireland, she said. And on the key point of the customs union - which currently prevents the UK from striking international trade deals - she suggested ""a form of customs agreement"" would be needed. Last week International Trade Secretary Liam Fox said it was ""very difficult"" to see how staying in a customs union would allow the UK to have an ""independent trade policy"" after Brexit. BBC political correspondent Susana Mendonca The accusations of cabinet divisions and disunity have kept coming from Brexit-supporting MPs over the past week. Now the home secretary has pushed back, saying the cabinet is ""more united than they think"". If that is the case, the cabinet will be expected to demonstrate some of that unity this week when discussions between Theresa May, David Davis and EU negotiator Michel Barnier are bound to throw up some bones of contention - the transition deal being the main one. Will the cabinet be singing from the same hymn sheet on that? And what about the customs union, another thorny issue that key ministers have very different views on? To silence its detractors, the cabinet will have to demonstrate this week it is neither ""vague"" nor ""divided"" - but whatever approach it comes up with is likely to lead to divisions with those who think they are going too far or not far enough. The role of the civil service has been thrust into the limelight in recent days by a leaked analysis predicting an economic hit to the UK after Brexit. Ms Rudd said the report did not ""model everything"" and predicted the UK economy would ""absolutely grow"" after Brexit, but said putting up trade barriers would have ""consequences"". Describing the civil service as the envy of the world, she added: ""We have to have these forecasts before making decisions."" She said she had been ""surprised"" at Mr Rees-Mogg's remarks and added that ministerial Brexit colleague Steve Baker - who has clashed with Whitehall unions and apologised to Parliament - had had an ""interesting week"". Mr Baker's apology followed a Commons exchange after which he was accused of not challenging Mr Rees-Mogg's suggestion of Treasury bias against Brexit. On the BBC's Sunday Politics, Conservative Party Chairman Brandon Lewis echoed Ms Rudd in saying Mr Rees-Mogg was wrong and defending Whitehall. Former top civil servants have also hit back at critics. Speaking on ITV's Peston on Sunday, ex-cabinet secretary Lord O'Donnell said claims officials were distorting figures were ""crazy"". People who do not like their analysis tend to shoot the ""messenger"", he said. ""We look at the evidence and we go where it is. ""Of course if you are selling snake oil, you don't like the idea of experts testing your products."" His predecessorAndrew Turnbull, who was cabinet secretary under Tony Blair, told the Observer,externalthat attacks on the civil service were similar to tactics used by German nationalists between the two world wars. BBC business reporter Rob Young Customs union members each apply the same tariff to goods bought from outside the EU. Goods from inside the EU are not subject to tariffs. Theresa May says Britain is leaving the customs union - so what will replace it? For a lot of firms, customs rules are just as important as a trade deal. Brexit could disrupt many supply chains, if businesses buy parts from Germany or Italy, for example. Many exporters want a new customs deal with the EU to reduce the need for border checks - limiting queues and paperwork. But this could restrict Britain's ability to strike international trade deals outside the EU. Some worry this undermines one of the key potential benefits of Brexit. Customs are also key to the future border with Ireland. No wonder this is one of the thorniest issues arising from Brexit. The UK and the EU do not currently agree on whether EU citizens moving to the UK during the planned two-year transition period after Brexit should get the same long-term rights as those who arrive before the UK leaves. Defending the UK's position, Ms Rudd said it was ""right to have a distinction between before March 2019 and afterwards"". Chancellor Philip Hammond has been the focus of much of the criticism from Brexiteers in the Conservative Party, and in his Telegraph article Mr Jenkin suggested Mr Hammond was not toeing the party line. ""If ministers are vague or divided, life for officials becomes impossible, as we can see now. Ministerial collective responsibility really matters,"" he said. He added: ""If the prime minister sticks to one policy and the chancellor keeps advocating another, what are officials meant to do?"" Earlier this month, Mr Hammond suggested the UK's relationship with the EUwould change only ""very modestly"" after Brexit. Mr Jenkin was a leading figure in the Vote Leave campaign But Mr Jenkin urged the prime ministerto stick to her positionand ensure, among other things, Britain leaves the single market and customs union. He wrote: ""She can only command a majority in Parliament on her present policy. ""Her MPs will back her, because we are overwhelmingly at one with the majority of the British people who now want a clean Brexit and an end to the present uncertainty.""

Reality Check: Defence spending,"The government has announced a reduction in the number of soldiers it plans to have in the Army by 2025, as part of itsIntegrated Review,external, examining ""the long-term strategic aims"" of UK national security, as well as defence, development and foreign policy. Although the number of soldiers will be falling, the UK's annual defence budget will be Â£7bn a year higher than previously committed to, by 2024-25. It had been widely reported that the government would be announcing a cut of 10,000 to the size of the Army, but that is not quite what is happening. What is being cut is the target for the number of fully-trained people in the Army, which is called the ""workforce requirement"". It is going down,externalfrom 82,040 today to 72,500 in 2025. Full-time trained strength is the number of soldiers who have completed both their general, basic training and a second phase of specialised training for a specific role. But the Army is not currently meeting its target - there are actually only 76,350 such soldiers in the Army, which is almost 6,000 short. So the Ministry of Defence is already well on the way to getting down to its new target. Does size matter for Britain's shrinking Army? Fact-checking claims about the Army, aid and nuclear weapons ""We've seen reductions in forces all over Europe as requirements for expeditionary responses have changed,"" Fenella McGerty, from the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) told BBC News. She added that it would enable the government to put a higher proportion of defence spending towards things like technology and research and development. But BBC Newsnight's defence editor, Mark Urban, told BBC Radio 4's PM programme that the reduction could have an impact on the type of operation the British military conducts in future. ""If you were going to try and do an ongoing commitment as Britain did in Helmand [in Afghanistan] for all those years of about 10,000 rolling over from one brigade group to the next...it would be extremely difficult with a force that size"". From 2010 to 2017, annual defence spending fell by Â£6.6bn in real terms (after factoring in rising prices over this period). That was a cut of 14.6% compared with the 2009-10 Budget, according to an analysis of government figures by the Institute for Fiscal Studies. Since the 2016-17 financial year, however, annual defence spending has increased by Â£3bn in real terms. The extra funding promised as part of the Integrated Review means that by the 2024-25 financial year, the defence budget will be Â£51.7bn in cash terms, which is Â£7bn more than previously planned. Trevor Taylor, of the Royal United Services Institute, said: ""This was an unexpectedly generous settlement that sent a signal that the government intended to maintain defence at a higher rate of GDP than 2% for several years at least."" GDP stands for Gross Domestic Product and is the value of everything produced by the economy in a year. An IISS study,externalattempts to rank the world's biggest defence budgets. It puts the UK fourth behind China, India and the United States. The USA spends more on defence than all of the other countries in the top 10 combined, with a budget of $738bn (Â£557bn) a year. But when defence expenditure is analysed as a proportionof gross domestic product (GDP),the UK falls to seventh in the world. While the UK makes it into the top 10 in terms of spending, it comes way down the list in terms of military personnel. Data from the World Bank,externalfor 2018 puts the UK in 42nd place, well behind the likes of India, China, North Korea, Russia and the USA. In 2019 the UK spent2.1% of GDP,externalon defence. Since 2014, Nato has set a target for its members to spend 2% of GDP on defence. However, there has been criticism surrounding the methodology used to calculate these numbers, such as whether war pensions count as defence spending. This article has been updated from a previous piece published in 2018.

UK could lose 'fight on beaches',"The Royal Navy could lose its ability to assault enemy held beaches, under plans being considered in the Ministry of Defence, BBC Newsnight understands. Two specialist landing ships - HMS Albion and Bulwark - would be taken out of service under the proposals. The plan - part of a package of cost-cutting measures - has caused alarm among senior Royal Marine officers. The MoD told the BBC that no decisions have been made yet and that discussion of options was ""pure speculation"". It is understood the head of the Royal Navy, Admiral Sir Philip Jones, formulated the move as part of a package designed to balance the books and free up sailors for the service's two new aircraft carriers. Critics say the proposal would deprive the Royal Marines of its core mission. Among other cuts envisaged are a reduction of 1,000 to the strength of the Royal Marines and the early retirement of two mine-hunting vessels and one survey vessel. A senior Royal Marine officer blamed the introduction of the new carriers for exacerbating the senior service's financial and manning problems. He told the BBC: ""This is the worst procurement decision of the past half century - that's what the Royal Marines are being sacrificed for."" The proposed cuts are part of a raft of ""adjustments"" being considered by all three services - the Royal Navy, the Army and the Royal Air Force - as the Ministry of Defence struggles to balance its books. The Royal Air Force could slow down orders of its new F35 fighter, and the Army could lose dozens of helicopters as part of their efforts towards the same goal. In 2015 there was aStrategic Defence and Security Review,external, a paper intended to act as a blueprint for the coming five years. However the depreciation of sterling has made big buys of foreign equipment more expensive and the armed forces have crammed the programme with too many projects, creating a hole in the budget. The government announced ""additional work to review national security capabilities"" in July - a review by stealth - under the leadership of its national security adviser Mark Sedwill. The proposed cuts to the Royal Navy have been put forward as part of this exercise. Under the 1997 defence review, a group of ships was created to improve the UK's ability to land its commando brigade, even in the face of opposition. At a glance: 2015 Strategic Defence Review Defence Review: Fighting old battles? Royal Navy 'woefully low' on warships The helicopter carrier Ocean, two specialist landing ships - Albion and Bulwark - and four logistic support ships were to be acquired to allow the 5,000 strong force to continue performing operations such as the 1982 Falklands landing, or the one on the Faw peninsula during the 2003 Iraq conflict. With the retirement of HMS Ocean already announced, and the new plans to lose the two landing ships, the Royal Marines' ability to use landing or hovercraft to get ashore would be drastically curtailed. In recent years, as an economy measure, the Royal Navy has only been crewing Albion or Bulwark alternately - they are big ships, each requiring a complement of 325. While the government has dubbed 2017 ""the Year of the Royal Navy"" and emphasised its commitment to a new national shipbuilding strategy, observers at the MoD noticed that this blueprint contained no commitment to renew the amphibious warfare fleet. The service is already committed to putting its two new carriers into service, replacing Trident, buying a new class of hunter-killer submarines, and two new types of frigate. ""The Royal Navy has got us into this mess"", said a senior MoD figure, referring to the department's budgetary black hole, ""so it's up to them to take the pain necessary to get us out of it"". With budgetary responsibility devolved to service chiefs, it fell to the head of the Navy Admiral Sir Philip Jones, to come up with proposals for how he could run the fleet within the financial and personnel limits he has been set.

Cats and dogs or stair rods? Your slang weather terms,"Regional slang words for different types of weatherare being considered for weather forecasts, the Met Office has said. Its research found a variety of slang words were used to describe UK weather. Here are some that have been submitted by readers to BBC News. I don't know where it comes from but we always said ""it is raining stair rods"" when it was really heavy. Another which is I assume is more common is ""good weather for ducks"". As a child I have heard - but not actually used it much in anger - is the term ""Noah's day"" if it rained or was forecast to rain heavy for all or most of the day.Philip Robinson, Lincolnshire The analogy for the term ""it is raining stair rods"" is the rain falling in long, straight streaks. The German and French languages have words using the imagery of ropes or cord to do the same thing. An expression in this area; now, I suspect, hardly ever used is ""it's black orr Bill's mother's"". This was when the sky was darkening ahead of a thunderstorm. I have met people who also knew this who lived in Leicester and another from Humberside. My wife's family from County Durham used the term ""it's stotting it down"" to describe rain that was so heavy it was bouncing off the ground.Stephen Veasey, Nottingham ""It's a bit black over Bill's mother"" - when dark clouds were gathering.  This could be from any direction, which initially led me to believe Bill's mother was on the move.Alan, Kent This is a phrase often heard in the English Midlands. Some believe ""Bill"" refers to William Shakespeare, whose mother Mary Arden lived in Stratford-Upon-Avon. But another theory is ""Bill"" actually refers to Kaiser Wilhelm II, the last German emperor and king of Prussia, who abdicated at the end of World War One. Germany's foreign policy at that time echoed Wilhelm's changeable and blustering character, according to the Open University. England's oddest phrases explained In Wales we say ""Mae hi'n bwrw hen wragedd a ffyn"" which literally means ""It's raining old ladies and sticks"".David Goadby, Pwllheli, north Wales Used to describe heavy rain, the English equivalent is ""it is raining cats and dogs"". I am over 60 and a south-east Londoner but have never heard heavy rain described as ""caning it"". I have, however, heard on many occasions when there is serious rain the words ""totally torrential"", ""tipping it down"" and ""inundated"", and to a lesser extent ""the clouds have materialised"".Daphne Cunningham, London I've lived in London for almost 30 years and have never heard ""caning it"".  Where I'm from in Cheshire, we'd say ""slinging it down"" or ""tipping it down"".  I wonder if the British have as many words for rain as Eskimos famously have for snow?Paula Dempsey, London What a splendid way to preserve our dialects and adages. In the Sunderland and Newcastle area heavy rain ""teeming down"" is the expression - ""chucking down"" is another.Anthony Bird We have some excellent terms for weather up here in the north-east of Scotland from ""driech"", ""smirrie rain"", ""it's fair dinging doon"", ""blowing a hoolie"", ""it's minging outside"" and probably heaps more.Sarah Kirkwood, Aberdeen I grew up and spent most of my life in Kent. My childhood was spent on a farm my father managed and I later went into farming myself where the  topic of the weather was never far away. Here are some of my favourite descriptions for the weather that I picked up on the way: ""Here comes Old Phoebe"" - the sun is coming out. ""It's damping about a bit"" - my father's expression for drizzle, usually meaning it wasn't wet enough to stop outdoor work ""It's cold enough for a walking stick"" - meaning there would be ice and a walking stick might be useful for the less agile ""There's enough blue sky to make a sailor a pair of trousers"" - said after rain when the sky starts to clear Fifty words for rain If you are cold in Nottingham you are feeling a bit ""nesh"" This can be directed at the weather: ""Oh it's gonna be nesh in the morning.""Zoe Johnson, Nottingham I have lived in York for more than 21 years (born in Sussex) and a word which is commonly used to describe the weather being exceptionally cold here is ""nithering"".  York is nithering for much of the year.Claire Sansford, York In Scarborough, heavy rain is often ""siling"" - this may have Norse origins. If it's hot, it's ""mafting "" and you may be said to be ""mafted "".

Airlines probed over seating policy,"A review is being launched into airlines' seating policies, the Civil Aviation Authority says. It will examine whether companies are deliberately splitting up groups of passengers so they pay to sit together. Airlines allocate seating via computer algorithms. The BBC has been told of many incidents of family and friends being split. A spokeswoman for Ryanair said: ""Our policy is very clear for our customers."" The CAA said it wanted to make sure seat allocation practices were ""fair and transparent"". CAA research of more than 4,000 passengers who had travelled as part of a group on 10 airlines in the last year found that just over half of respondents were told they would have to pay more to sit together before they booked. However, almost half believed that their airline would automatically allocate them seats together. Of the group of respondents that paid extra to sit together, six in 10 said they did so because of the risk that their airline might split up their group. Natalie Williams was separated from her two young children At least twice a year, Natalie Williams takes her children to visit her parents, who live in Portugal. Returning to the UK after an Easter holiday in 2017, she checked in online and found the family of four had been completely separated. ""That meant a two-year-old child and five-year-old travelling on their own. ""We were not even anywhere near them. I didn't think that was acceptable,"" she says. She says no one was available to help at the main desk or at the gate, so she was left to ask other passengers to move so that they could travel in pairs and her children would not be alone. ""Luckily both travellers were happy to help and get separated from their own group."" Ms Williams has complained to TAP Air Portugal but has not received a response. Gill Willis paid extra to sit next to her husband on a Ryanair flight back from Fuerteventura in 2017. ""When we got on the plane the lady next to us was behind her husband and the seat I had originally been allocated remained empty next to him. ""So there was no need to have paid extra as they could have just rearranged so the two couples sat together,"" she said. She added: ""It is just a money making rip-off exercise. I really hope something is done as it is completely unnecessary."" Andrew Haines, chief executive of the CAA, said airline seating practices were ""clearly causing some confusion"" and its research showed some passengers were paying to sit together when they might not need to. ""We will be looking into how airlines decide where to seat passengers that have booked as part of a group and whether any airlines are pro-actively splitting up groups of passengers when, in fact, they could be sat together,"" he said. ""We will not hesitate to take any necessary enforcement action should it be required at the end of the review,"" he added. Sprawling Maya cities uncovered by lasers Uma Thurman breaks silence on Weinstein attack Spain cracks king's 500-year-old code A spokeswoman for Ryanair said the airline was happy to co-operate. ""Our policy is very clear for our customers and seats can be purchased from just â¬2 and kids travelling in families get free seats,"" she said. In a statement, EasyJet said: ""Unlike some airlines, if passengers choose not to pay to select their seats, EasyJet's seating system is programmed to try and seat families together when they check-in online by using an algorithm."" 2017 safest year for air travel Soaring airport drop-off fees 'severe' Firefighters running out of water as wildfire declared most destructive in LA's history In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?

PM vows to tackle political intimidationTheresa May will consider new legislation to protect candidates and their families.14m15 minutes agoUK Politics,"The prime minister is set to announce a crackdown on the intimidation of political candidates, 100 years after some women got the vote. Theresa May will make an appeal for ""tolerance and respect"" and say it is unacceptable for anyone to face threats over their political view. She will consider a new offence to protect politicians and their families. Areport,externalpreviously found women, ethnic minority and gay candidates were most likely to be targets of abuse. The move follows a week in which Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg was caught up in ascuffle at a Bristol universityand Labour Haringey council leader Claire Koberquit over claims of sexism and bullyingby party supporters. This video can not be played Claire Kober accuses Labour of sexism and bullying Ms Kober told the BBC's Andrew Marr she does not blame individuals, but pointed to a ""particular political toxic culture"" across the whole country. MP fears being pushed off a Tube platform MPs speak out about 'sinister' election abuse The 100-year-old protest posters that show women's outrage In a speech marking the centenary of women getting the vote, Mrs May will pay tribute to those who braved ""open hostility and abuse"". The Representation of the People Act, passed on 6 February 1918, gave the vote to women over the age of 30 and ""of property"". But 100 years on, the prime minister will say political discussion is becoming harder to have without resulting in ""tribalism and rancour"". While British democracy is ""robust and oppositional"", Mrs May will say a line has been crossed when disagreement turns to intimidation. Lord Bew, who chairs the Committee on Standards in Public Life, has previouslywarned the level of personal abuse had reached a ""tipping point""and could deter people from running for office. ""The abuse I receive personally tends to come from the hard right of politics,"" said Labour MP Cat Smith. ""The organised groups tend to be Britain First, the EDL, who are very threatening,"" she said. One comment she received read: ""I want to see your head swinging from Tower Bridge."" Ms Smith said there was ""absolutely no doubt"" female MPs received more abuse - particularly those from black and ethnic minority backgrounds. She wrote letter to Conservative Party chairman Sir Patrick McLoughlin, accusing the party of ""propagating personal attacks, smears and untruths"". ""Some of the very personal attacks bordered on the racist,"" she told the BBC. ""It almost gives people permission, who are racist online, to take that a step further."" MPs reveal scale of abuse they receive Mrs May will also highlight exploitation of social media and the option to be anonymous. ""It is time we asked ourselves seriously whether we really want it to be like this. Whether we are prepared to accept a permanent coarsening and toxifying of our public debate or whether, together, we will take a stand for decency, tolerance and respect,"" Mrs May will add. Among those to reveal the abuse experienced on a daily basis, has been shadow home secretary Dianne Abbott. Using strong and graphic language, shetold a Westminster Hall debateabout the torrent of ""mindless"" abuse  - including death threats - that she and her staff receive, which had been ""turbo charged"" by the speed and anonymity of social media. This video can not be played Diane Abbott describes 'racist, sexist' abuse In her speech, the prime minister will announce that from May 2019 candidates in local elections will no longer be forced to publish their address on ballot papers. This would offer them the same protection as UK parliamentary candidates, who are not required to state where they live. Mrs May will also cite examples where certain individuals and their families had been targeted at home. A Labour spokesman said the party condemns personal attacks and that leader Jeremy Corbyn never engages in them.

Jack Whitehall 'regrets lewd Queen joke'The comedian tells BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs the backlash affected his family.3h3 hours agoEntertainment & Arts,"Whitehall has worked with his father Michael on a number of TV shows Comedian Jack Whitehall has said he regrets making a crass joke about the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh. Appearing on BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs he recalled his remark about a bladder infection on Channel 4's Big Fat Quiz Of The Year in 2012. Whitehall said he upset his family and is now a ""lot more careful"" about what he says and ""self-censor[s] more"". He said: ""I have a relatively thick skin but I never wanted to drag them into it"". He said that after he made the joke, in a pre-recorded episode of the quiz show, he was on the front of newspapers ""every day for a week"". ""That was not nice, because it was something I'd said that caused them upset and that was the bit that hurt the most,"" he added. Uma Thurman breaks silence on Weinstein attack US House speaker deletes tax cuts tweet Lady Gaga halt tours due to 'severe pain' The 29-year-old told presenter Kirsty Young that in the early stages of his career he did not give his family the ""best version"" of himself. Whitehall's relationship with his father, Michael, has been highlighted by joint ventures in the TV shows Backchat and Travels With My Father. But he insists the more tender moments on-screen can never really be planned. ""We don't really talk about our emotions as a family, we're not necessarily very good at that, but it's amazing."" Whitehall admitted the nature of his work meant spending time with relatives was sometimes sacrificed. ""I got very bad at it. I'd come to life when on a show and I'd be upbeat and fun, and when I was with [my family], I was kind of twitchy and on edge and anxious about work. ""And then I took a conscious effort, I was like, I need to spend more time with them and be careful that I never do that and never take them for advantage, because I'm so close to my family, and they're so supportive."" He told the programme it upset him when people would suggest his success was down to his father's career as a celebrity agent. ""To become a stand-up comedian, the fact that my dad used to look after Christopher Biggins doesn't necessarily help you get stage time. ""That's the bit that needles me, and now I've said it people will needle with me more!""

Turkey suffers deadliest day in Afrin,"Turkey says it has sent troops into Afrin to drive out Kurdish militias The Turkish military has suffered the deadliest day in its offensive against Kurdish militias inside northern Syria, with seven soldiers killed. Five of the troops died when their tank was attacked in the Afrin region. PM Binali Yildirim vowed to make the militias ""pay for this twice as much"" and jets later struck Kurdish targets north-east of the city of Afrin. Turkey's ""Olive Branch"" operation was launched on 20 January to drive the Kurdish YPG militia out of Afrin. Turkey views the YPG (People's Protection Units) as a terrorist group and an extension of the banned Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which has fought for Kurdish autonomy in south-eastern Turkey for three decades. The military said in a statement that the US-backed YPG attacked the tank in Sheikh Haruz, north-east of Afrin city. Two other soldiers were killed earlier, the military said, one in Afrin and another on the Turkish side of the border in an attack blamed on the YPG. Turkey has now lost 14 soldiers in fierce clashes during the offensive. Outcry over dead Kurdish female fighter 'We will never abandon our homes' Mr Yildirim reiterated on Saturday that the aim of operation ""Olive Branch"" was to eradicate what he called ""a terror belt"" along Turkey's borders. ""It is an operation aimed at liberating Arabs, and our Kurdish and Turkmen brothers who have been groaning under oppression,"" he told members of the governing Justice and Development Party (AKP). Turkish troops are being accompanied by pro-Turkey rebels from the Free Syrian Army (FSA). President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Saturday that the Turkish-led forces were taking high ground and would now head towards the city of Afrin itself, saying: ""There is not much [further] to go."" Turkey says it has killed some 900 Kurdish fighters, but this cannot be independently verified. Thousands of people have been displaced by the Turkish-led offensive that also involves about 10,000 Syrian rebels. A Syrian Kurdish health official said on Saturday that 150 civilians had been killed and 300 wounded since the start of the Turkish operation, but this also cannot be independently verified. Funerals for Kurdish fighters killed in the Turkish operation have taken place in Afrin ""The Turkish air raids and artillery shelling have been mostly targeting civilians, including women and children,"" Angela Rasho told Kurdish TV. She urged international monitors to ""come here and see the situation for themselves"". Western powers, including the US and France, are urging restraint. Thousands of Kurds protested outside the Council of Europe in Strasbourg on Saturday against the offensive. They carried banners reading ""Erdogan assassin"" and ""defend Afrin"", and shouted slogans such as ""silence kills"" outside the Council of Europe offices. One protester, Suleyman Akguc, told Agence France-Presse: ""We want to sound the alarm because the Kurds in Afrin have fought against the Islamic State and are being massacred today. The silence of the European leaders is deadly."" Fighters from the Free Syrian Army rebel group are fighting alongside Turkish troops A similar protest was held in Paris, with about 2,000 protesters marching from the Gare de l'Est towards the Place de la Republique. How historical Afrin became a prize worth a war Why Turkey is targeting Kurdish enclave in Syria President Erdogan sought to reassure his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron on Saturday that Turkey was not trying to seize territory in northern Syria. In a phone call, he told Mr Macron that Turkey had ""no eye on the territory of another country"" and that the operation was ""aimed at purging"" Afrin of ""terror elements"", the state-run Anadolu news agency reported. Mr Macron riled Turkish leaders last week when he said in a newspaper interview that France would have a ""real problem"" if Turkey was engaged in an ""invasion operation"". Separately, Human Rights Watch on Saturday accused Turkish border guards of firing on would-be asylum seekers trying to enter from Syria. A government official denied the accusation, saying Turkey had an ""open-door policy"". Turkey has taken more Syrian refugees than any other nation.

Russian jet shot down in Syria,"Images said to show the wreckage of the Sukhoi-25 A Russian Sukhoi-25 ground-attack aircraft has been shot down in a rebel-held area in Syria's north-western province of Idlib. The Russian defence ministry said the pilot had ejected into an area believed to be controlled by the jihadist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham alliance. Although he survived the crash he was killed in a ground fight, Moscow said. Hayat Tahrir al-Sham - formerly linked to al-Qaeda - said it had shot down the plane. The Syrian government, backed by Russian air power, launched a major offensive in December against rebel groups in Idlib. Why is there a war in Syria? The Sukhoi-25, a close-support ground-attack aircraft, was operating over the town of Maasran in Idlib. There had been dozens of Russian air strikes in the area over the previous 24 hours, monitoring groups said. It is not yet known who shot the plane down or how Video posted on social media showed the jet being hit and quickly catching fire, before spiralling to the ground. Video from the ground showed the wreckage with red stars on the wings. Russia's defence ministry said: ""The pilot had enough time to report that he had ejected in an area controlled by the militants"". ""During a battle with terrorists, the pilot was killed."" Other video on social media showed a bloodied body in a uniform. In a statement released on social media, the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham group claimed it had shot down the plane using a shoulder-launched surface-to-air missile. The group said the plane had been carrying out an air raid over the nearby city of Saraqeb. Hayat Tahrir al-Sham has operated in the region for years under a series of different names. Tahrir al-Sham: Al-Qaeda's latest incarnation in Syria The defence ministry said it was making all possible efforts to retrieve the body. However, social media posts also reported a salvo of cruise missiles had been fired into Idlib province from Russian navy vessels in the Mediterranean. The Russian defence ministry confirmed only that ""a series of high-precision weapons strikes has been delivered on the area"". Very. It could be the first time rebels have shot down a Russian jet since Moscow began its Syria campaign in September 2015, although rebels did bring down a helicopter in 2016. This video can not be played This video shows a plane falling to the ground on the Syrian border with Turkey About 45 Russian military personnel have been confirmed dead in Syria, along with an unknown number of contractors. Here are the air force losses: Dec 2017: Shelling damages several planes at the Hmeimim airbase, with two Russian servicemen killed Dec 2016:A Tu-154 carrying 92 people - including army musicians - crashes into the Black Seaafter taking off for Syria from Sochi, killing all on board Aug 2016: All five people on board a helicopter are killed when it is shot down over Idlib Nov 2015:Turkish warplanes shoot down a Sukhoi-24. One pilot is killed, the other rescued. The incident sparks a severe deterioration of bilateral relations It is supposed to be a ""de-escalation zone"", as agreed by Turkey, Russia and Iran. But fighting escalated in November and the Syrian government launched a major offensive there in December. Hayat Tahrir al-Sham is the main adversary. The UN says some 100,000 civilians have been displacedby the fighting. There are 2.65 million people in north-western Syria as a whole, the UN says, and 1.16 million of them are internally displaced people (IDPs). No. Turkey launched an operation on 20 January called ""Olive Branch"" aimed at removing Kurdish militiamen from Afrin, to the north-west of the city of Aleppo. The Turkish army said seven Turkish soldiers were killed in action on Saturday, including five who died in an attack on a tank by the Kurdish YPG (People's Protection Units) militia. It was heaviest Turkish death toll in one day since the operation began. Kurds in Syria also reacted furiously to a video showing the body of a female Kurdish fighterkilled in battle.

Turkey suffers deadliest day in AfrinSeven soldiers die in the Turkish-led offensive to drive Kurdish militias from the Syrian region.3h3 hours agoMiddle East,"Turkey says it has sent troops into Afrin to drive out Kurdish militias The Turkish military has suffered the deadliest day in its offensive against Kurdish militias inside northern Syria, with seven soldiers killed. Five of the troops died when their tank was attacked in the Afrin region. PM Binali Yildirim vowed to make the militias ""pay for this twice as much"" and jets later struck Kurdish targets north-east of the city of Afrin. Turkey's ""Olive Branch"" operation was launched on 20 January to drive the Kurdish YPG militia out of Afrin. Turkey views the YPG (People's Protection Units) as a terrorist group and an extension of the banned Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which has fought for Kurdish autonomy in south-eastern Turkey for three decades. The military said in a statement that the US-backed YPG attacked the tank in Sheikh Haruz, north-east of Afrin city. Two other soldiers were killed earlier, the military said, one in Afrin and another on the Turkish side of the border in an attack blamed on the YPG. Turkey has now lost 14 soldiers in fierce clashes during the offensive. Outcry over dead Kurdish female fighter 'We will never abandon our homes' Mr Yildirim reiterated on Saturday that the aim of operation ""Olive Branch"" was to eradicate what he called ""a terror belt"" along Turkey's borders. ""It is an operation aimed at liberating Arabs, and our Kurdish and Turkmen brothers who have been groaning under oppression,"" he told members of the governing Justice and Development Party (AKP). Turkish troops are being accompanied by pro-Turkey rebels from the Free Syrian Army (FSA). President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Saturday that the Turkish-led forces were taking high ground and would now head towards the city of Afrin itself, saying: ""There is not much [further] to go."" Turkey says it has killed some 900 Kurdish fighters, but this cannot be independently verified. Thousands of people have been displaced by the Turkish-led offensive that also involves about 10,000 Syrian rebels. A Syrian Kurdish health official said on Saturday that 150 civilians had been killed and 300 wounded since the start of the Turkish operation, but this also cannot be independently verified. Funerals for Kurdish fighters killed in the Turkish operation have taken place in Afrin ""The Turkish air raids and artillery shelling have been mostly targeting civilians, including women and children,"" Angela Rasho told Kurdish TV. She urged international monitors to ""come here and see the situation for themselves"". Western powers, including the US and France, are urging restraint. Thousands of Kurds protested outside the Council of Europe in Strasbourg on Saturday against the offensive. They carried banners reading ""Erdogan assassin"" and ""defend Afrin"", and shouted slogans such as ""silence kills"" outside the Council of Europe offices. One protester, Suleyman Akguc, told Agence France-Presse: ""We want to sound the alarm because the Kurds in Afrin have fought against the Islamic State and are being massacred today. The silence of the European leaders is deadly."" Fighters from the Free Syrian Army rebel group are fighting alongside Turkish troops A similar protest was held in Paris, with about 2,000 protesters marching from the Gare de l'Est towards the Place de la Republique. How historical Afrin became a prize worth a war Why Turkey is targeting Kurdish enclave in Syria President Erdogan sought to reassure his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron on Saturday that Turkey was not trying to seize territory in northern Syria. In a phone call, he told Mr Macron that Turkey had ""no eye on the territory of another country"" and that the operation was ""aimed at purging"" Afrin of ""terror elements"", the state-run Anadolu news agency reported. Mr Macron riled Turkish leaders last week when he said in a newspaper interview that France would have a ""real problem"" if Turkey was engaged in an ""invasion operation"". Separately, Human Rights Watch on Saturday accused Turkish border guards of firing on would-be asylum seekers trying to enter from Syria. A government official denied the accusation, saying Turkey had an ""open-door policy"". Turkey has taken more Syrian refugees than any other nation.

"UK police look into more Weinstein claimsTwo more women have made allegations against the Hollywood producer, it has emerged.8h8 hours agoUK","Harvey Weinstein, pictured in 2013, was one of Hollywood's most powerful men UK police investigating Hollywood film producer Harvey Weinstein are looking at allegations of sexual assault against two more women, it has emerged. The alleged offences, reported to police in October and November, took place in the Republic of Ireland in 1991, Westminster in 2011 and abroad in 2010, the Metropolitan Police said. These bring the number of women making accusations to the Met to nine. Mr Weinstein has denied all allegations of non-consensual sex. On 31 October a woman told UK police that she had been assaulted by Mr Weinstein in the Republic of Ireland. This allegation has been passed on to Garda SÃ­ochÃ¡na - the Irish police force. On 13 November a ninth alleged victim told police she had been attacked in Westminster in 2011 and a location outside the UK in 2010. Scotland Yard says the allegation will be passed to the relevant force. Uma Thurman says the alleged incident took place in Mr Weinstein's suite at London's Savoy Hotel This comes on the same day thatactress Uma Thurman alleged that Mr Weinstein assaulted her in a London hotel roomafter the success of the 1994 Quentin Tarantino film Pulp Fiction. In a New York Times article,,externalshe says Weinstein pushed her down and ""tried to expose himself"" before she managed to ""wriggle away"". ""He did all kinds of unpleasant things,"" she says. ""But he didn't actually put his back into it and force me. You're like an animal wriggling away, like a lizard."" A spokeswoman for Harvey Weinstein - who is in rehab - said: ""Mr Weinstein acknowledges making an awkward pass 25 years ago at Ms Thurman in England after misreading her signals, after a flirtatious exchange in Paris, for which he immediately apologised and deeply regrets.

England's puzzling city sights explained,"BBC website readers got in touch to ask questions about these sights There are some sights in cities across England that have left our readers puzzled. What is a statue of an American president doing here and why are some of our telephone boxes a different colour? Here are the answers to some of the questions our readers asked us to investigate. Matt Larbey, 30, said he asked the question after moving to the city and finding it ""a bit odd"" to see a statue of the 16th US president there. ""I heard a story that it was gifted because of something to do with the American Civil War... I'd love to know more about the story behind it,"" he said. The statue was donated by Mr and Mrs Charles Phelps Taft of Cincinnati, Ohio Mr Larbey had heard correctly - the statue honours Manchester's allegiance to Abraham Lincoln's Union during the American Civil War. The city boycotted cotton picked in the southern states in protest against slave labour,according to Visit Manchester.,external The resulting Lancashire Cotton Famine led to mass unemployment and poverty among textile workers in Manchester. They put their principles ahead of the need to feed their families and their actions assisted Lincoln in ending the Civil War. Lincoln wrote a letter praising the working people of Manchesterfor their ""sublime Christian heroism"". The statue, by George Grey Barnard, was originally sited in the grounds of Platt Hall, Platt Fields Park, in 1919. It was moved to Lincoln Square on Brazennose Street in 1986. Mr Larbey said: ""I always assumed that Manchester's history with the American Cotton industry and slavery would be more negative. ""One of the things I love about Manchester is how much civic pride everyone has."" England's oddest phrases explained The landmarks that mean you're nearly home England's steepest streets Hull's telephone network is run by independent provider KCOM Hull's telephone network was never run by the Post Office which was responsible for red phone boxes. In 1904, Hull City Council was one of several local authorities to set up their own phone network. Back then it was called Hull Telephone Department and today it isKCOM.,externalIt had cream phone boxes. Other authorities later gave up control of their networks to the Post Office which wanted to create a single national service. While the Post Office network was eventually taken over by BT, Hull's remained independent. All of the communications in the city were run by the city council until it sold its final stake in 2007 and soall of the phone boxes are cream,not the red that BT uses. Nanda Menon asked this question after noticing it when he moved to London from Malaysia in the 1960s. ""No one really seemed to know or were even aware that this particular quirk existed,"" he said. Cars drive on the right on the approach to the Savoy Hotel for a practical reason An act of parliament was passed in 1902 allowing carriages and cars to enter Savoy Court on the right. This was to prevent cars dropping off or picking up people at the Savoy Theatre from blocking the hotel's entrance. However, other benefits did emerge from the arrangement, a spokeswoman for the Savoy Hotel told us. Women traditionally sat behind their chauffeur, so pulling up on the right meant the rich and famous could exit their car in style. The driver did not need to walk around the vehicle to open the door so the guest could move straight from the car into the hotel.

'It is raining stair rods',"Regional slang words for different types of weatherare being considered for weather forecasts, the Met Office has said. Its research found a variety of slang words were used to describe UK weather. Here are some that have been submitted by readers to BBC News. I don't know where it comes from but we always said ""it is raining stair rods"" when it was really heavy. Another which is I assume is more common is ""good weather for ducks"". As a child I have heard - but not actually used it much in anger - is the term ""Noah's day"" if it rained or was forecast to rain heavy for all or most of the day.Philip Robinson, Lincolnshire The analogy for the term ""it is raining stair rods"" is the rain falling in long, straight streaks. The German and French languages have words using the imagery of ropes or cord to do the same thing. An expression in this area; now, I suspect, hardly ever used is ""it's black orr Bill's mother's"". This was when the sky was darkening ahead of a thunderstorm. I have met people who also knew this who lived in Leicester and another from Humberside. My wife's family from County Durham used the term ""it's stotting it down"" to describe rain that was so heavy it was bouncing off the ground.Stephen Veasey, Nottingham ""It's a bit black over Bill's mother"" - when dark clouds were gathering.  This could be from any direction, which initially led me to believe Bill's mother was on the move.Alan, Kent This is a phrase often heard in the English Midlands. Some believe ""Bill"" refers to William Shakespeare, whose mother Mary Arden lived in Stratford-Upon-Avon. But another theory is ""Bill"" actually refers to Kaiser Wilhelm II, the last German emperor and king of Prussia, who abdicated at the end of World War One. Germany's foreign policy at that time echoed Wilhelm's changeable and blustering character, according to the Open University. England's oddest phrases explained In Wales we say ""Mae hi'n bwrw hen wragedd a ffyn"" which literally means ""It's raining old ladies and sticks"".David Goadby, Pwllheli, north Wales Used to describe heavy rain, the English equivalent is ""it is raining cats and dogs"". I am over 60 and a south-east Londoner but have never heard heavy rain described as ""caning it"". I have, however, heard on many occasions when there is serious rain the words ""totally torrential"", ""tipping it down"" and ""inundated"", and to a lesser extent ""the clouds have materialised"".Daphne Cunningham, London I've lived in London for almost 30 years and have never heard ""caning it"".  Where I'm from in Cheshire, we'd say ""slinging it down"" or ""tipping it down"".  I wonder if the British have as many words for rain as Eskimos famously have for snow?Paula Dempsey, London What a splendid way to preserve our dialects and adages. In the Sunderland and Newcastle area heavy rain ""teeming down"" is the expression - ""chucking down"" is another.Anthony Bird We have some excellent terms for weather up here in the north-east of Scotland from ""driech"", ""smirrie rain"", ""it's fair dinging doon"", ""blowing a hoolie"", ""it's minging outside"" and probably heaps more.Sarah Kirkwood, Aberdeen I grew up and spent most of my life in Kent. My childhood was spent on a farm my father managed and I later went into farming myself where the  topic of the weather was never far away. Here are some of my favourite descriptions for the weather that I picked up on the way: ""Here comes Old Phoebe"" - the sun is coming out. ""It's damping about a bit"" - my father's expression for drizzle, usually meaning it wasn't wet enough to stop outdoor work ""It's cold enough for a walking stick"" - meaning there would be ice and a walking stick might be useful for the less agile ""There's enough blue sky to make a sailor a pair of trousers"" - said after rain when the sky starts to clear Fifty words for rain If you are cold in Nottingham you are feeling a bit ""nesh"" This can be directed at the weather: ""Oh it's gonna be nesh in the morning.""Zoe Johnson, Nottingham I have lived in York for more than 21 years (born in Sussex) and a word which is commonly used to describe the weather being exceptionally cold here is ""nithering"".  York is nithering for much of the year.Claire Sansford, York In Scarborough, heavy rain is often ""siling"" - this may have Norse origins. If it's hot, it's ""mafting "" and you may be said to be ""mafted "". And if it's miserable - or if someone you know is - ""dowly "".Mat Watkinson, Scarborough England's oddest phrases explained Cats and dogs?

The truth about our shrinking snacks,"Many of the nation's favourite treats are getting smaller, but BBC research has found that some prices are falling too. Chocoholics and biscuit-lovers have been outraged in recent years by news of so-called ""shrinkflation"". That is when food manufacturers reduce the weight of their products without shrinking the price. So with the traditional January detox over, and many Britons reaching for a sweet snack, we have looked at whether the customer always loses out. We analysed 19 products over the last four years from high street chains Asda, Ocado/Waitrose, Sainsburys and Tesco. The figures reveal that 18 of the 19 products have been slimmed down. Five products hit by shrinkflation Jaffa quake as McVitie's cuts pack sizes More than 2,500 products subject to shrinkflation, says ONS Manufacturers often blame the rising cost of ingredients. Mondelez International, which makes Toblerone, said it had carried the costs for ""as long as possible"" before deciding to make their triangles further apart. Nestle said it had reduced weights sometimes to reduce calories or bring manufacturing in different countries into line. Others point to exchange rates, in other words how their buying power has been hit by falls in the value of the pound. But whether it is the ingredients, exchange rates, or saving us from obesity and bad teeth, all manufacturers insist that they give customers value for money. The price of a product is driven by all kinds of factors such as packaging, transport and marketing which might not change with alterations in weight. We have looked at price in two ways - price per 100g and actual price paid at the checkout per pack or bar. Four of our 19 products have got cheaper per 100g, while others have risen sharply. But many consumers will be concerned simply with the price they pay at the checkout per pack or bar. The data here shows more price drops but clearly these are not always in proportion to weight reductions. In total, nine of our 19 products had gone down in price per pack. Manufacturers know that keeping their products affordable is important. So while the ""shrink"" is overwhelming, the ""flation"" (raising prices by stealth) is happening... not quite so much. Produced by David Brown, Daniele Palumbo, Mark Bryson and Luke Keast. About the data:19 products were selected for which there was consistent price and weight data over a four year period from January 2014 to 25th January 2018. The data shown represent an average of the shelf price data provided by companies. Data supplied by Brand View.

"End intimidation in politics, PM to warn","The prime minister is set to announce a crackdown on the intimidation of political candidates, 100 years after some women got the vote. Theresa May will make an appeal for ""tolerance and respect"" and say it is unacceptable for anyone to face threats over their political view. She will consider a new offence to protect politicians and their families. Areport,externalpreviously found women, ethnic minority and gay candidates were most likely to be targets of abuse. The move follows a week in which Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg was caught up in ascuffle at a Bristol universityand Labour Haringey council leader Claire Koberquit over claims of sexism and bullyingby party supporters. This video can not be played Claire Kober accuses Labour of sexism and bullying Ms Kober told the BBC's Andrew Marr she does not blame individuals, but pointed to a ""particular political toxic culture"" across the whole country. MP fears being pushed off a Tube platform MPs speak out about 'sinister' election abuse The 100-year-old protest posters that show women's outrage In a speech marking the centenary of women getting the vote, Mrs May will pay tribute to those who braved ""open hostility and abuse"". The Representation of the People Act, passed on 6 February 1918, gave the vote to women over the age of 30 and ""of property"". But 100 years on, the prime minister will say political discussion is becoming harder to have without resulting in ""tribalism and rancour"". While British democracy is ""robust and oppositional"", Mrs May will say a line has been crossed when disagreement turns to intimidation. Lord Bew, who chairs the Committee on Standards in Public Life, has previouslywarned the level of personal abuse had reached a ""tipping point""and could deter people from running for office. ""The abuse I receive personally tends to come from the hard right of politics,"" said Labour MP Cat Smith. ""The organised groups tend to be Britain First, the EDL, who are very threatening,"" she said. One comment she received read: ""I want to see your head swinging from Tower Bridge."" Ms Smith said there was ""absolutely no doubt"" female MPs received more abuse - particularly those from black and ethnic minority backgrounds. She wrote letter to Conservative Party chairman Sir Patrick McLoughlin, accusing the party of ""propagating personal attacks, smears and untruths"". ""Some of the very personal attacks bordered on the racist,"" she told the BBC. ""It almost gives people permission, who are racist online, to take that a step further."" MPs reveal scale of abuse they receive Mrs May will also highlight exploitation of social media and the option to be anonymous. ""It is time we asked ourselves seriously whether we really want it to be like this. Whether we are prepared to accept a permanent coarsening and toxifying of our public debate or whether, together, we will take a stand for decency, tolerance and respect,"" Mrs May will add. Among those to reveal the abuse experienced on a daily basis, has been shadow home secretary Dianne Abbott. Using strong and graphic language, shetold a Westminster Hall debateabout the torrent of ""mindless"" abuse  - including death threats - that she and her staff receive, which had been ""turbo charged"" by the speed and anonymity of social media. This video can not be played Diane Abbott describes 'racist, sexist' abuse In her speech, the prime minister will announce that from May 2019 candidates in local elections will no longer be forced to publish their address on ballot papers. This would offer them the same protection as UK parliamentary candidates, who are not required to state where they live. Mrs May will also cite examples where certain individuals and their families had been targeted at home. A Labour spokesman said the party condemns personal attacks and that leader Jeremy Corbyn never engages in them.

Five defence spending questions,"A distinguished group of former military top brass haswritten an open letter to the prime ministerwarning that Britain's security is at risk unless the armed forces are properly funded. The letter reflects concern right across the ranks. The list includes not just the ""old and the bold"" - retired admirals, generals and air marshals - but former colonels, corporals and academics, too. The reality is that defence is not always top of the list of voters' concerns at an election. These are some of the questions behind the letter: There's always the danger of crying wolf. But few would disagree that the world is dangerous. The letter cites risks from all over the globe - whether from hostile states or extremist groups. Ministers have long argued that Britain's armed forces are the envy of the world and that even outside the European Union they'll play an important role. Some have even suggested that defence and security could be the UK's trump card in the difficult negotiations. The implication being that Europe's own security would suffer if they turned their back on Britain. Those who've signed this letter are not so sure. Brexit has already made the pound weaker. The letter says its fall ""threatens the purchase of meaningful numbers of jets"" for the Royal Navy's new aircraft carriers. Almost $30bn (Â£22bn) worth of foreign military purchases planned by the MOD are exposed to currency fluctuations. That said, Britain is not leaving Nato - and it remains the cornerstone of European defence. The Nato alliance has set a target for its members to spend 2% of their national income, or GDP, on defence. Britain currently meets and is committed to that goal. In fact,Britain is one of the few Nato members to spend at least 2% on defence, according to the alliance's own figures. But MPs on the Commons Defence Committee say it'sbeen reached by ""creative accounting"",external. Those who've signed the letter put it more bluntly. They say it's a deception. In 2015, the government started adding several items of expenditure not previously included, such as military and civil service pensions, contributions to UN peacekeeping missions as well as much of the MOD's Â£1.4bn income. In the words of the letter ""most analysts now agree core defence expenditure for hard military power is well below 2%."" However, the calculations are entirely in accordance with Nato's own rules. It is true that defence spending rose this year. But it follows years of cuts. Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon says the lean years are behind us. He says the MOD is spending Â£178bnon new equipment - including new jets, warships, aircraft carriers and armoured vehicles. Though that money is being spent over the next 10 years and also includes the cost of renewing Britain's Trident weapons system. The Treasury used to help foot that bill. A number of recent reports also question whether the MOD's equipment programme has been fully funded. Earlier this year, the government spending watchdog, the National Audit Office, noted that billions of pounds of efficiencieshad not yet been identified,external. While those who've signed the letter praise the government's2015 Defence and Security Review,externalas setting ""the right path for our long term security"", they say it has not been fully funded. They cite another report by MPs on the Public Accounts Committee who said ""the affordability of the Equipment Plan is at greater risk than at any time since its inception"". Policy tracker: What the parties have promised Election questions, answered Britain's armed forces are now at their smallest since the Napoleonic wars. The size of the army alone has been cut from more than 100,000 to just 82,000. Even then, the army is struggling with recruitment and is still below its fully trained strength. The government would argue that, though smaller, the armed forces are now more capable. Investment has been made in new equipment from body armour to drones. But there are still significant gaps. For example, Royal Navy warships are no longer fitted with any anti-ship missiles. The Navy can't afford them. Some capabilities have been ""hollowed out"". While the Royal Navy will soon have two new aircraft carriers, it's still not clear how many jets the MOD will be able to afford. Or how many new warships will be built to protect them. Those who've signed the letter warn that the armed forces are ""having to seek further very damaging savings in manpower support and training"". The seats where parties are choosing to stand aside Where Britain's parties stand on Brexit The last coalition government accused Labour of leaving a Â£34bn black hole in the MOD's budget. It was the reason why the 2010 Defence Review resulted in such savage cuts. However, during his time as defence secretary, Philip Hammond claimed to have balanced the books. Under Sir Michael Fallon, though, the accounts are under significant pressure. The recentreport by the National Audit Officesaid there's now a real risk of a return to the ""previous practice where affordability could only be maintained by delaying or reducing the cost of projects"". It's probably too early to say whether there's now a new black hole in the MODs accounts. But some estimate a gap of at least Â£10bn and growing. This is by no means the first time that former senior military officers have warned of a crisis in defence. But it's still not clear whether those concerns are shared by the voters, and whether defence features much in the general election.

What's happening to defence spending?,"The government has announced a reduction in the number of soldiers it plans to have in the Army by 2025, as part of itsIntegrated Review,external, examining ""the long-term strategic aims"" of UK national security, as well as defence, development and foreign policy. Although the number of soldiers will be falling, the UK's annual defence budget will be Â£7bn a year higher than previously committed to, by 2024-25. It had been widely reported that the government would be announcing a cut of 10,000 to the size of the Army, but that is not quite what is happening. What is being cut is the target for the number of fully-trained people in the Army, which is called the ""workforce requirement"". It is going down,externalfrom 82,040 today to 72,500 in 2025. Full-time trained strength is the number of soldiers who have completed both their general, basic training and a second phase of specialised training for a specific role. But the Army is not currently meeting its target - there are actually only 76,350 such soldiers in the Army, which is almost 6,000 short. So the Ministry of Defence is already well on the way to getting down to its new target. Does size matter for Britain's shrinking Army? Fact-checking claims about the Army, aid and nuclear weapons ""We've seen reductions in forces all over Europe as requirements for expeditionary responses have changed,"" Fenella McGerty, from the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) told BBC News. She added that it would enable the government to put a higher proportion of defence spending towards things like technology and research and development. But BBC Newsnight's defence editor, Mark Urban, told BBC Radio 4's PM programme that the reduction could have an impact on the type of operation the British military conducts in future. ""If you were going to try and do an ongoing commitment as Britain did in Helmand [in Afghanistan] for all those years of about 10,000 rolling over from one brigade group to the next...it would be extremely difficult with a force that size"". From 2010 to 2017, annual defence spending fell by Â£6.6bn in real terms (after factoring in rising prices over this period). That was a cut of 14.6% compared with the 2009-10 Budget, according to an analysis of government figures by the Institute for Fiscal Studies. Since the 2016-17 financial year, however, annual defence spending has increased by Â£3bn in real terms. The extra funding promised as part of the Integrated Review means that by the 2024-25 financial year, the defence budget will be Â£51.7bn in cash terms, which is Â£7bn more than previously planned. Trevor Taylor, of the Royal United Services Institute, said: ""This was an unexpectedly generous settlement that sent a signal that the government intended to maintain defence at a higher rate of GDP than 2% for several years at least."" GDP stands for Gross Domestic Product and is the value of everything produced by the economy in a year. An IISS study,externalattempts to rank the world's biggest defence budgets. It puts the UK fourth behind China, India and the United States. The USA spends more on defence than all of the other countries in the top 10 combined, with a budget of $738bn (Â£557bn) a year. But when defence expenditure is analysed as a proportionof gross domestic product (GDP),the UK falls to seventh in the world. While the UK makes it into the top 10 in terms of spending, it comes way down the list in terms of military personnel. Data from the World Bank,externalfor 2018 puts the UK in 42nd place, well behind the likes of India, China, North Korea, Russia and the USA. In 2019 the UK spent2.1% of GDP,externalon defence. Since 2014, Nato has set a target for its members to spend 2% of GDP on defence. However, there has been criticism surrounding the methodology used to calculate these numbers, such as whether war pensions count as defence spending.

Outcry over dead Kurdish fighter,"Barin Kobani (right) was killed in northern Afrin earlier this week, reports say Kurds in Syria have reacted furiously to a video showing the body of a female Kurdish fighter killed in battle during a Turkish-led offensive. Barin Kobani, who was part of all-female unit in northern Syria, was seen surrounded by Turkish-backed rebels. Kurdish officials initially accused the rebels of mutilating her corpse, but later said she had blown herself up. Last month, Turkish troops and their Syrian allies launched a campaign to capture the Kurdish-held Afrin region. The Turkish army said seven Turkish soldiers were killed in action on Saturday, including five who died in an attack on a tank by the Kurdish YPG (People's Protection Units) militia. It was the heaviest Turkish death toll in one day since the operation began on 20 January. Barin Kobani was part of the YPG's all-female unit, the YPJ. She was killed during fighting earlier this week in the northern part of the region, reports say. Turkey views the YPG as a terrorist group and an extension of the banned Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which has fought for Kurdish autonomy in south-eastern Turkey for three decades. The US has provided the YPG and allied Arab fighters with weapons and air support to help them battle the jihadist group Islamic State (IS) in Syria. 'We will never abandon our homes' How historical Afrin became a prize worth a war Why Turkey is targeting Kurdish enclave in Syria A video emerged on social media earlier this week, and the woman was soon identified as Barin Kobani. The footage shows a group of rebels standing around the bloodied body of a woman lying on the ground. The body has a deep abdominal wound. ""We hold the Turkish government responsible for this heinous act,"" Kurdish-led authorities said. Barin Kobani's family were among thousands of people who took part in a mass funeral in Afrin on Saturday for people killed in the conflict Turkey has not publicly commented on the video. Thousands of people have been displaced by the Turkish-led offensive, launched by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in a bid to crush the YPG, which controls Afrin and more than 400km (250 miles) of Syria's northern border. Some 10,000 Syrian rebels are taking part in the campaign. Correction: An earlier version of this story referred to two videos showing Barin Kobani's body. One of the videos is now thought to be of a second dead female fighter.

Why target Kurdish forces?,"A Turkish tank positioned on the Turkish-Syrian border near Manbij in December Turkey says it has begun a massive assault on Kurdish forces on the other side of the border with Syria - potentially putting it in direct conflict with its Nato ally, the United States. This could become a significant new development in the Syrian civil war, which is now almost seven years old. We've boiled down why it matters. You can choose to read the short, medium or long story below, either by themselves or one after the other. Why is Turkey mounting this assault? One main reason: Turkey considers the US-backed Kurdish militia that controls much of north-eastern Syria a terrorist group. Turkey says the militia is an extension of a Kurdish rebel group it has fought for decades, and wants to prevent it consolidating its hold on Syrian territory. Recent US plans to help the militia form a 30,000-strong ""border security force"" alarmed Ankara. Turkey's president said Washington was ""creating a terror army"" and vowed to ""suffocate"" it. Turkey wants to clear Kurdish forces from Afrin - where operations began on 20 January - and Manbij. Turkey has vowed to crush a Syrian Kurdish militia called the People's Protection Units (YPG), which it considers a terrorist group. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan says it is an extension of the banned Kurdistan Workers' Party, which has fought for Kurdish autonomy in Turkey for three decades. The YPG denies any direct organisational links - an assertion backed by a US-led coalition whose air strikes have helped the militia and allied Arab fighters drive Islamic State militants from tens of thousands of square kilometres of Syria. Ankara has condemned the US for supporting the YPG and was alarmed when it recently emerged that the coalition was helping it form a 30,000-strong ""border security force"". While Turkey has long threatened to clear YPG fighters from the Kurdish enclave of Afrin, in north-western Syria, and Manbij, a mainly Arab town to the east, the news appears to have brought those plans forward. A day after vowing to stop the US ""creating a terror army on our border"", Mr Erdogan declared that Turkish troops and allied Syrian rebels would soon destroy ""nests of terror"". Turkish tanks began building up along the border near Afrin and troops have been shelling the enclave from inside the rebel-held Syrian province of Idlib. Air strikes were launched on 20 January as Turkey announced the operation had begun. Kurdish leaders promised to defend Afrin and urged the international community to prevent Turkey targeting what they said were its 1m residents. Russia, the Syrian government's ally, says it will not interfere in the conflict. It has have moved its troops away from the area. A Turkish assault has opened a new front in a war that activists say has already cost more than 340,000 lives. The UN says it is ready to help displaced civilians if required. Why is Turkey doing this now? To understand the seemingly imminent offensives, it's important to understand Turkey's relations with the Kurds, and who some of the main players are in the Syrian conflict. Turkey had been threatening to attack the Kurdish-controlled towns of Afrin and Manbij for some time in an attempt to counter a militia called the People's Protection Units (YPG), which it considers a terrorist group. Turkey sees the militia as being an extension of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which is banned in Turkey and has fought for Kurdish autonomy there since 1984. The YPG denies any direct military or political links with the PKK. A YPG fighter monitoring the area near Afrin in June 2017 The US also rejects Turkey's portrayal of the militia, a key ally in the battle against Islamic State. The YPG is part of an alliance with a number of ethnic Arab militias called the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). With the help of US air strikes, its fighters have captured tens of thousands of square kilometres from IS. Who are the Kurds? IS and the crisis in Iraq and Syria in maps Despite being part of the US-led coalition against IS, Turkey has vehemently opposed supporting the SDF and tried to stop it taking control of Syria's northern border. In 2016, the Turkish military supported a Syrian rebel offensive that drove IS militants out of the key towns of Jarablus and al-Bab and stopped SDF fighters moving towards Afrin. The US dissuaded Turkey from also attempting to take the mainly Arab town of Manbij from the SDF by force, but got the YPG to agree to withdraw east of the River Euphrates. Turkish officials say that has not yet happened. One recent development appears to have brought forward Turkey's plans to clear YPG fighters from Afrin and Manbij. News broke on 13 January that the US was helping the SDF build a new ""border security force"". US officials said the plan was to train about 30,000 personnel - half of them SDF fighters - to help prevent infiltration by IS militants across the Turkish and Iraqi borders and parts of the River Euphrates, which effectively divides SDF- and Syrian government-held regions. The announcement enraged Turkey. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said that he considered the border force to be a ""terror army"". Syria's government, which has mostly avoided conflict with the Kurds, called it a ""blatant attack"" on its sovereignty. Russia, the government's ally, warned it was a step towards the partition of Syria. Mr Erdogan went on to say Turkish troops and Syrian rebels would soon destroy ""nests of terror"" along its border, ""starting with Afrin and Manbij"". It's significant for a few reasons: Afrin is separated from Manbij and other SDF-controlled areas by a pocket of territory held by Turkish-backed rebels If Afrin and Manbij were to fall, Turkish-backed forces would control a 200km (125-mile) continuous stretch of Syria's northern border west of the Euphrates The YPG has not said how many fighters it has in the two areas, but Turkey's state-run Anadolu news agency estimated that there were about 8,000 to 10,000 in Afrin. It is also not clear if US military personnel are deployed around Manbij, as they were last year. It risks bringing the interests of two Nato allies into direct conflict and also have a major impact on relations between Turkey and Russia. Russia - a key military figure in the region - has said it will not interfere in the conflict. As Turkey announced it was beginning the assault on Afrin, Russia said its troops had been relocated elsewhere. Russia controls the enclave's airspace - so Turkey's air strikes that began on 20 January must have had Russian clearance. As this piece explains, a tacit Russian approval for the incursion might bring Moscow and Ankara closer together and have implications for Turkish relations with the West. A siege of Afrin could have grave humanitarian consequences. Kurdish officials say there could be 1m people living in Afrin. Leaving an enclave surrounded by territory held by the Syrian government, and mountains, would be difficult. The UN's refugee agency told the BBC it was prepared to help if needed.

Afrin: A prize worth a war,"Afrin has been semi-autonomous since Syrian troops pulled out in 2012 Afrin and its environs are beautiful, a rich prize worth fighting for. The region is known as Kurd-Dagh - the Mountain of the Kurds - where 360 thriving Kurdish villages make it the most densely Kurdish populated part of Syria. The Afrin River runs north-south through heavily treed hills. The lush valleys and fertile red soil are renowned for their excellent fruit and nut produce, especially olives. No snakes or scorpions are said to inhabit this soil. Water flows in abundance. Afrin is famed for its olive groves The Midanki Falls were tamed in 2004 by a dam so the old road now vanishes abracadabra-like into a long thin lake. At weekends locals picnic and barbecue round its shores. Arabic is hardly spoken north of Midanki and older men still dress traditionally in baggy black trousers. Why Turkey is targeting Kurdish enclave in Syria Who are the Kurds? IS and the crisis in Iraq and Syria in maps Neighbouring Azaz is also home to many Turkmen and Arab communities. Almost everyone, Kurds included, is Sunni Muslim. Kurdish identity is based not on religion, but on ethnicity and cultural heritage. Overlooking the Afrin River, within sight of the Turkish border, sprawl the vast Roman ruins of Cyrrhus, a suitable vantage point from which to digest the epic struggles of this region and to ponder the dilemmas unfolding here today. A Roman bridge across the Afrin River is still used by traffic Cyrrhus once served as a military base for the Romans conducting campaigns against the Armenian Empire to the north. By the 4th Century it had become an important centre for Christianity with its own bishop, but was abandoned in the 12th Century after losing its strategic role. Nearby stands the landmark which gives the site its local name, al-Nabi Houri, the pyramid-roofed tomb of Uriah the Hittite, sent to his death in battle by Israelite King David so that he could marry the lovely Bathsheba, his widow, according to the scriptures. Tomb of Uriah the Hittite, killed on the order of King David, according to the scriptures Today the tomb is a Muslim shrine and mosque, tended by a Kurdish household whose patriarch lost his leg, not in battle, but in a minefield as he crossed the Turkish border to visit relatives. Such complexities are reflected in a 1935 map of Syria compiled by troops of the French Mandate. It shows the religious and ethnic communities of Syria just before the French gifted the Sanjak of Alexandretta on the Mediterranean coast to Turkey as a bribe to keep it neutral in World War Two. A 1935 French Mandate map of Syria and Lebanon The Turks renamed it Hatay, its population then estimated at 50% Arab, 40% Turkish and 10% Armenian. Syrian maps still mark the Hatay border as ""temporary"". Throughout the volatile seven-year Syrian war, conflicting parties routinely produce maps with differing claims of territorial control. Afrin, abutting Hatay to the west and rebel-held Idlib to the south, is the latest victim, as Turkey once again tries to force what it sees as ""terrorist Kurds"" out. The last time was in 1998, when Syria was sheltering Turkey's nemesis Abdullah Ocalan and his Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which has waged a decades-long insurgency for autonomy in south-east Turkey. As a result of Turkish pressure, Syria expelled the group and its leader. When Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's soldiers quietly withdrew from northern Kurdish areas in summer 2012, the well-organised Kurds of the Democratic Union Party (PYD) - the dominant Kurdish party in northern Syria, regarded by Turkey as an extension of the PKK - quickly took charge, setting up their own education system and administration. The PYD's armed wing, the People's Protection Units (YPG), effectively became the military. Kurdish soldiers are tough, used historically by the Ottomans and the French, and today by the Americans to help fight the Islamic State group (IS) in Syria. This video can not be played Why is Turkey attacking Syria? Mark Lowen explains But the real fight may yet be among the Syrian Kurds themselves, for not all support Mr Ocalan, despite the omnipresence of his photo. Thousands have fled PYD rule in order to escape large-scale conscription and the use of child soldiers. Many complain the PYD are mercenaries and criminals. Stories of human rights abuses abound, like bulldozing Arab villagers' homes on the pretext of clearing out IS extremists, accusations the PYD denies. Since 2015, private schools, including those teaching in Arabic, have been forced to close by the Kurdish administration. Meanwhile, the Syrian state continues to issue all civil documents, such as birth, marriage and death certificates, in an attempt to maintain influence. With so many competing interests, the fight for Afrin will be ugly. Kurdish dreams of ""democratic federalism"" and Turkish dreams of safe zones free of ""terrorists"" may lead inexorably to Syria's de facto partition. Whatever the future holds for Afrin, one side's dream is likely to be the other's nightmare.

While Turkey has long threatened to clear YPG fighters from the Kurdish enclave of Afrin, in north-western Syria, and Manbij, a mainly Arab town to the east, the news appears to have brought those plans forward. A day after vowing to stop the US ""creating a terror army on our border"", Mr Erdogan declared that Turkish troops and allied Syrian rebels would soon destroy ""nests of terror"". Turkish tanks began building up along the border near Afrin and troops have been shelling the enclave from inside the rebel-held Syrian province of Idlib. Air strikes were launched on 20 January as Turkey announced the operation had begun. Kurdish leaders promised to defend Afrin and urged the international community to prevent Turkey targeting what they said were its 1m residents. Russia, the Syrian government's ally, says it will not interfere in the conflict. It has have moved its troops away from the area. A Turkish assault has opened a new front in a war that activists say has already cost more than 340,000 lives. The UN says it is ready to help displaced civilians if required. Why is Turkey doing this now? To understand the seemingly imminent offensives, it's important to understand Turkey's relations with the Kurds, and who some of the main players are in the Syrian conflict. Turkey had been threatening to attack the Kurdish-controlled towns of Afrin and Manbij for some time in an attempt to counter a militia called the People's Protection Units (YPG), which it considers a terrorist group. Turkey sees the militia as being an extension of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which is banned in Turkey and has fought for Kurdish autonomy there since 1984. The YPG denies any direct military or political links with the PKK. A YPG fighter monitoring the area near Afrin in June 2017 The US also rejects Turkey's portrayal of the militia, a key ally in the battle against Islamic State. The YPG is part of an alliance with a number of ethnic Arab militias called the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). With the help of US air strikes, its fighters have captured tens of thousands of square kilometres from IS. Who are the Kurds? IS and the crisis in Iraq and Syria in maps Despite being part of the US-led coalition against IS, Turkey has vehemently opposed supporting the SDF and tried to stop it taking control of Syria's northern border. In 2016, the Turkish military supported a Syrian rebel offensive that drove IS militants out of the key towns of Jarablus and al-Bab and stopped SDF fighters moving towards Afrin. The US dissuaded Turkey from also attempting to take the mainly Arab town of Manbij from the SDF by force, but got the YPG to agree to withdraw east of the River Euphrates. Turkish officials say that has not yet happened. One recent development appears to have brought forward Turkey's plans to clear YPG fighters from Afrin and Manbij. News broke on 13 January that the US was helping the SDF build a new ""border security force"". US officials said the plan was to train about 30,000 personnel - half of them SDF fighters - to help prevent infiltration by IS militants across the Turkish and Iraqi borders and parts of the River Euphrates, which effectively divides SDF- and Syrian government-held regions. The announcement enraged Turkey. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said that he considered the border force to be a ""terror army"". Syria's government, which has mostly avoided conflict with the Kurds, called it a ""blatant attack"" on its sovereignty. Russia, the government's ally, warned it was a step towards the partition of Syria. Mr Erdogan went on to say Turkish troops and Syrian rebels would soon destroy ""nests of terror"" along its border, ""starting with Afrin and Manbij"". It's significant for a few reasons: Afrin is separated from Manbij and other SDF-controlled areas by a pocket of territory held by Turkish-backed rebels If Afrin and Manbij were to fall, Turkish-backed forces would control a 200km (125-mile) continuous stretch of Syria's northern border west of the Euphrates The YPG has not said how many fighters it has in the two areas, but Turkey's state-run Anadolu news agency estimated that there were about 8,000 to 10,000 in Afrin. It is also not clear if US military personnel are deployed around Manbij, as they were last year. It risks bringing the interests of two Nato allies into direct conflict and also have a major impact on relations between Turkey and Russia. Russia - a key military figure in the region - has said it will not interfere in the conflict. As Turkey announced it was beginning the assault on Afrin, Russia said its troops had been relocated elsewhere. Russia controls the enclave's airspace - so Turkey's air strikes that began on 20 January must have had Russian clearance. As this piece explains, a tacit Russian approval for the incursion might bring Moscow and Ankara closer together and have implications for Turkish relations with the West. A siege of Afrin could have grave humanitarian consequences. Kurdish officials say there could be 1m people living in Afrin. Leaving an enclave surrounded by territory held by the Syrian government, and mountains, would be difficult. The UN's refugee agency told the BBC it was prepared to help if needed.

How Afrin became a prize worth a war,"Afrin has been semi-autonomous since Syrian troops pulled out in 2012 Afrin and its environs are beautiful, a rich prize worth fighting for. The region is known as Kurd-Dagh - the Mountain of the Kurds - where 360 thriving Kurdish villages make it the most densely Kurdish populated part of Syria. The Afrin River runs north-south through heavily treed hills. The lush valleys and fertile red soil are renowned for their excellent fruit and nut produce, especially olives. No snakes or scorpions are said to inhabit this soil. Water flows in abundance. Afrin is famed for its olive groves The Midanki Falls were tamed in 2004 by a dam so the old road now vanishes abracadabra-like into a long thin lake. At weekends locals picnic and barbecue round its shores. Arabic is hardly spoken north of Midanki and older men still dress traditionally in baggy black trousers. Why Turkey is targeting Kurdish enclave in Syria Who are the Kurds? IS and the crisis in Iraq and Syria in maps Neighbouring Azaz is also home to many Turkmen and Arab communities. Almost everyone, Kurds included, is Sunni Muslim. Kurdish identity is based not on religion, but on ethnicity and cultural heritage. Overlooking the Afrin River, within sight of the Turkish border, sprawl the vast Roman ruins of Cyrrhus, a suitable vantage point from which to digest the epic struggles of this region and to ponder the dilemmas unfolding here today. A Roman bridge across the Afrin River is still used by traffic Cyrrhus once served as a military base for the Romans conducting campaigns against the Armenian Empire to the north. By the 4th Century it had become an important centre for Christianity with its own bishop, but was abandoned in the 12th Century after losing its strategic role. Nearby stands the landmark which gives the site its local name, al-Nabi Houri, the pyramid-roofed tomb of Uriah the Hittite, sent to his death in battle by Israelite King David so that he could marry the lovely Bathsheba, his widow, according to the scriptures. Tomb of Uriah the Hittite, killed on the order of King David, according to the scriptures Today the tomb is a Muslim shrine and mosque, tended by a Kurdish household whose patriarch lost his leg, not in battle, but in a minefield as he crossed the Turkish border to visit relatives. Such complexities are reflected in a 1935 map of Syria compiled by troops of the French Mandate. It shows the religious and ethnic communities of Syria just before the French gifted the Sanjak of Alexandretta on the Mediterranean coast to Turkey as a bribe to keep it neutral in World War Two. A 1935 French Mandate map of Syria and Lebanon The Turks renamed it Hatay, its population then estimated at 50% Arab, 40% Turkish and 10% Armenian. Syrian maps still mark the Hatay border as ""temporary"". Throughout the volatile seven-year Syrian war, conflicting parties routinely produce maps with differing claims of territorial control. Afrin, abutting Hatay to the west and rebel-held Idlib to the south, is the latest victim, as Turkey once again tries to force what it sees as ""terrorist Kurds"" out. The last time was in 1998, when Syria was sheltering Turkey's nemesis Abdullah Ocalan and his Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which has waged a decades-long insurgency for autonomy in south-east Turkey. As a result of Turkish pressure, Syria expelled the group and its leader. When Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's soldiers quietly withdrew from northern Kurdish areas in summer 2012, the well-organised Kurds of the Democratic Union Party (PYD) - the dominant Kurdish party in northern Syria, regarded by Turkey as an extension of the PKK - quickly took charge, setting up their own education system and administration. The PYD's armed wing, the People's Protection Units (YPG), effectively became the military. Kurdish soldiers are tough, used historically by the Ottomans and the French, and today by the Americans to help fight the Islamic State group (IS) in Syria. This video can not be played Why is Turkey attacking Syria? Mark Lowen explains But the real fight may yet be among the Syrian Kurds themselves, for not all support Mr Ocalan, despite the omnipresence of his photo. Thousands have fled PYD rule in order to escape large-scale conscription and the use of child soldiers. Many complain the PYD are mercenaries and criminals. Stories of human rights abuses abound, like bulldozing Arab villagers' homes on the pretext of clearing out IS extremists, accusations the PYD denies. Since 2015, private schools, including those teaching in Arabic, have been forced to close by the Kurdish administration. Meanwhile, the Syrian state continues to issue all civil documents, such as birth, marriage and death certificates, in an attempt to maintain influence. With so many competing interests, the fight for Afrin will be ugly. Kurdish dreams of ""democratic federalism"" and Turkish dreams of safe zones free of ""terrorists"" may lead inexorably to Syria's de facto partition. Whatever the future holds for Afrin, one side's dream is likely to be the other's nightmare.

"Russian jet shot down in SyriaThe Sukhoi-25 crashes in a rebel-held area in Idlib and the pilot is killed in a firefight, Russia says.5h5 hours agoMiddle East","Images said to show the wreckage of the Sukhoi-25 A Russian Sukhoi-25 ground-attack aircraft has been shot down in a rebel-held area in Syria's north-western province of Idlib. The Russian defence ministry said the pilot had ejected into an area believed to be controlled by the jihadist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham alliance. Although he survived the crash he was killed in a ground fight, Moscow said. Hayat Tahrir al-Sham - formerly linked to al-Qaeda - said it had shot down the plane. The Syrian government, backed by Russian air power, launched a major offensive in December against rebel groups in Idlib. Why is there a war in Syria? The Sukhoi-25, a close-support ground-attack aircraft, was operating over the town of Maasran in Idlib. There had been dozens of Russian air strikes in the area over the previous 24 hours, monitoring groups said. It is not yet known who shot the plane down or how Video posted on social media showed the jet being hit and quickly catching fire, before spiralling to the ground. Video from the ground showed the wreckage with red stars on the wings. Russia's defence ministry said: ""The pilot had enough time to report that he had ejected in an area controlled by the militants"". ""During a battle with terrorists, the pilot was killed."" Other video on social media showed a bloodied body in a uniform. In a statement released on social media, the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham group claimed it had shot down the plane using a shoulder-launched surface-to-air missile. The group said the plane had been carrying out an air raid over the nearby city of Saraqeb. Hayat Tahrir al-Sham has operated in the region for years under a series of different names. Tahrir al-Sham: Al-Qaeda's latest incarnation in Syria The defence ministry said it was making all possible efforts to retrieve the body. However, social media posts also reported a salvo of cruise missiles had been fired into Idlib province from Russian navy vessels in the Mediterranean. The Russian defence ministry confirmed only that ""a series of high-precision weapons strikes has been delivered on the area"". Very. It could be the first time rebels have shot down a Russian jet since Moscow began its Syria campaign in September 2015, although rebels did bring down a helicopter in 2016. This video can not be played This video shows a plane falling to the ground on the Syrian border with Turkey About 45 Russian military personnel have been confirmed dead in Syria, along with an unknown number of contractors. Here are the air force losses: Dec 2017: Shelling damages several planes at the Hmeimim airbase, with two Russian servicemen killed Dec 2016:A Tu-154 carrying 92 people - including army musicians - crashes into the Black Seaafter taking off for Syria from Sochi, killing all on board Aug 2016: All five people on board a helicopter are killed when it is shot down over Idlib Nov 2015:Turkish warplanes shoot down a Sukhoi-24. One pilot is killed, the other rescued. The incident sparks a severe deterioration of bilateral relations It is supposed to be a ""de-escalation zone"", as agreed by Turkey, Russia and Iran. But fighting escalated in November and the Syrian government launched a major offensive there in December. Hayat Tahrir al-Sham is the main adversary. The UN says some 100,000 civilians have been displacedby the fighting. There are 2.65 million people in north-western Syria as a whole, the UN says, and 1.16 million of them are internally displaced people (IDPs). No. Turkey launched an operation on 20 January called ""Olive Branch"" aimed at removing Kurdish militiamen from Afrin, to the north-west of the city of Aleppo. The Turkish army said seven Turkish soldiers were killed in action on Saturday, including five who died in an attack on a tank by the Kurdish YPG (People's Protection Units) militia. It was heaviest Turkish death toll in one day since the operation began. Kurds in Syria also reacted furiously to a video showing the body of a female Kurdish fighterkilled in battle.

Italy drive-by attack targets immigrantsA man suspected of racially-motivated shootings that injure six is arrested in the town of Macerata.8h8 hours agoEurope,"A handgun was found in the suspect's car Italian police have arrested a gunman suspected of carrying out a drive-by shooting spree that targeted African immigrants. At least six people were wounded in the central town of Macerata. The suspect, named locally as Luca Traini, 28, had an Italian flag wrapped around his neck when he was detained. He had taken part in regional elections for the anti-immigration Northern League last year and reportedly made a fascist salute when he was captured. Italy votes in national elections on 4 March, with immigration one of the key issues. The suspect, named locally as Luca Traini, following his detention Mr Traini, who is from the surrounding Le Marche region, did not resist when he was detained after fleeing from his car near the town's war memorial. He is now being questioned. Police found a gun in his car. The shooting had begun two hours earlier at about 11:00 local time (10:00 GMT), La Repubblica website reports. The mayor had warned people to stay indoors during the incident, which saw shootings across a number of locations. The victims are being treated in hospital. At least one of them is said to be in a serious condition. The shootings took place in various parts of the town Video of the moment the suspect was apprehended,externalwas published by local website, Il Resto del Carlino, showing a white bald man draped in an Italian tricolour being escorted away by police.

Shots had been fired in the Via Spalato and Via dei Velini parts of town, two key areas in an investigation into the murder of an 18-year-old girl whose body was found dismembered and hidden in two suitcases last Wednesday. A 29-year-old Nigerian male migrant has been detained over the killing of Pamela Mastropietro. Several racist comments calling for revenge attacks were posted on the Facebook page of the victim's mother in the run up to Saturday's shootings, Ansa reports. Local reports are linking the two incidents. Bullet holes were found on shop windows in the area targeted by the gunman Right-wing politicians have been using Pamela Mastropietro's killing to promote their anti-migrant message as part of their campaign for the general election. Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni has temporarily suspended campaigning over the shootings. Opinion polls suggest a centre-right bloc, including the Northern League, Forza Italia and the far-right Brothers of Italy, will win the most seats but not a working majority. With about 28% support in the opinion polls, the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement is the most popular single party. This suggests there could be tough coalition negotiations, or even another election, after 4 March.
