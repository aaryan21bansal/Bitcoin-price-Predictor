Sopranos actress says Weinstein raped her,"The Sopranos star alleges that the producer raped her in New York in 1992 Italian-American actress Annabella Sciorra, who starred in US TV series The Sopranos, has accused disgraced producer Harvey Weinstein of rape. She toldThe New Yorker,externalthat Weinstein forced his way into her New York apartment and assaulted her in 1992. She alleges that he sexually harassed her in the subsequent years. In the article actress Daryl Hannah also says she was harassed by Weinstein. His spokeswoman again said the producer denies claims of non-consensual sex. On Thursdayanother actress, Natassia Malthe, accused the producer of raping her in a London hotel roomin 2008. More than 50 women have now accused Harvey Weinstein of a range of allegations ranging from rape to sexual harassment. Who has accused Weinstein? How the scandal unfolded Weinstein could be stripped of CBE Malthe held a press conference with lawyer Gloria Allred, who is representing a number of Weinstein's accusers Ms Sciorra told the New Yorker's Ronan Farrow that the assault happened in 1992 after she had filmed The Night We Never Met, which Weinstein produced. The producer forced himself into her apartment in New York while she was getting ready for bed after he had dropped her off following a group dinner. She said Weinstein ""pushed the door open"" and refused to leave when asked, before shoving her onto the bed and raping her. ""I struggled, but I had very little strength left in me,"" she said. ""Like most of these women, I was so ashamed of what happened. And I fought. I fought. But still I was like, Why did I open that door?... I felt disgusting."" Charmed and Scream actress Rose McGowan has also accused the producer of rape The actress said she did not report the incident to the police, but alleges her career began to suffer and did not work again until 1995. ""I just kept getting this pushback of 'We heard you were difficult; we heard this or that.' I think that that was the Harvey machine."" She said the producer continued to pursue her, including turning up at her hotel room at the 1997 Cannes Film Festival wearing only his underwear. Actress Daryl Hannah also came forward on 27 October with harassment allegations Actress Daryl Hannah, who starred in Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill series that Weinstein produced, also came forward with new allegations. She said Weinstein tried to force himself into her hotel room when they were promoting Kill Bill and its sequel. The films were written and directed byQuentin Tarantino, who has admitted that he had some prior knowledge of Weinstein's behaviour. Hannah said that on one occasion the producer asked to grope her and then requested that she expose herself. Since claims against him began to surface in early October, Mr Weinstein has joined a sex rehabilitation programme, but he has ""unequivocally denied"" all allegations of non-consensual sex.

Sacked Catalan leader 'welcome to stand',"This video can not be played Sarah Rainsford met protesters in Madrid who are calling for a united Spain The Spanish government has said it would welcome the participation of sacked Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont in new elections. The central government in Madrid has ordered that fresh elections for the regional parliament of Catalonia should take place in December. It stripped Catalonia of its autonomy after the Catalan parliament voted to declare independence. Mr Puigdemont is urging ""democratic opposition"" to direct rule from Madrid. He condemned the suspension of Catalonia's autonomy and promised to continue to ""work to build a free country"". Spain has been gripped by a constitutional crisis since an independence referendum, organised by Mr Puigdemont's separatist government, was held earlier this month in defiance of a ruling by the Constitutional Court which had declared it illegal. The Catalan government said that of the 43% of potential voters who took part, 90% were in favour of independence. Friday saw the regional parliament declare independence, with Madrid responding by declaring the move illegal. Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy then announced the dissolution of the regional parliament and the removal of Mr Puigdemont as Catalan leader, and ordered that fresh regional elections should be held. Madrid's enforcer for Catalonia Catalonia crisis: What next for Spain? A large anti-independence demonstration is expected to take place later on Sunday in Barcelona, Catalonia's regional capital. The political crisis will also be played out on the football pitch  in the afternoon when Real Madrid, the defending Spanish champions, travel to Catalonia to play Girona, the team supported by Mr Puigdemont. Saturday saw the government in Madrid remove Catalonia's autonomy and take over government functions in the region. An official state bulletin (in Spanish) handed control of Catalonia to Spain's Deputy Prime Minister,external, Soraya Saenz de Santamaria. And Spain's interior ministry took charge of Catalonia's police after firing senior Catalan police officials. This video can not be played Flags in Catalonia and what they mean A central government spokesman in Madrid, ÃÃ±igo MÃ©ndez de Vigo, said Mr Puigdemont had the right to continue in politics, despite his removal from office. ""I'm quite sure that if Puigdemont takes part in these elections, he can exercise this democratic opposition,"" he said, quoted by Reuters. ""The Catalans will be able to say what they feel about what they've been seeing in this last year, with all sorts of failing the law, abusing the law and putting themselves outside the law,"" he added. Puigdemont said Madrid's actions were ""premeditated aggression"" He spoke after Mr Puigdemont, in a pre-recorded address to Catalans on Saturday afternoon, said the central government's actions were ""premeditated aggression"" that ran ""contrary to the expressed will of the citizens of our country, who know perfectly well that in a democracy it is parliaments that choose, or remove, presidents"". He added:  ""We continue persevering in the only attitude that can make us winners. Without violence, without insults, in an inclusive way, respecting people and symbols, opinions, and also respecting the protests of the Catalans who do not agree with what the parliamentary majority has decided."" Barca coach ducks Catalan questions EU risks ""more cracks"" appearing A poll published by Spanish national newspaper El Pais on Saturday suggests more Catalans (52% to 43%) are in favour of the dissolution of the regional parliament and the holding of elections. Fifty-five per cent of Catalan respondents opposed the declaration of independence, with 41% in favour. Before Madrid took over the Catalan government, the region had one of the greatest levels of self-government in Spain. It has its own parliament, police force and public broadcaster, as well as a government and president, though those have now been dismissed. Catalans had a range of powers in many policy areas,externalfrom culture and environment to communications, transportation, commerce and public safety. What powers has Catalonia now lost? The case for and against independence Foreign affairs, the armed forces and fiscal policy were always the sole responsibility of the Spanish government. This video can not be played The moment Catalan parliament declared independence There have been pro-unity demonstrations, with protesters in Barcelona waving Spanish flags and denouncing Catalan independence. Saturday saw several thousand people attend a rally in Madrid, waving Spanish flags and calling for national unity. Some accused Catalonia's leaders of treason. After the 1 October referendum, Mr Puigdemont signed a declaration of independence but delayed implementation to allow talks with the Spanish government. He ignored warnings by the Madrid government to cancel the move, prompting Mr Rajoy to threaten to remove Catalan leaders and impose direct rule. Does Catalonia want to leave Spain? Reality Check: Police violence in Catalonia Catalonia is one of Spain's richest, most distinctive regions, with a high degree of autonomy. Many Catalans feel they pay more to Madrid than they get back, and there are historical grievances, too, in particular Catalonia's treatment under the dictatorship of General Franco. But Catalans have been divided on the question of independence. Are you in Catalonia? What is your reaction to the latest developments?

10 charts that show why sleep is so important,"We often hear that we should all be getting eight hours' sleep a night. Organisations from the NHS to the US National Sleep Foundation recommend it. But where does this advice come from? Studies carried out around the world, looking at how often diseases occur in different groups of people across a population, have come to the same conclusion: both short sleepers and long sleepers are more likely to have a range of diseases, and to live shorter lives. But it's hard to tell whether it is short sleep that is causing disease or whether it is a symptom of a less healthy lifestyle. Short sleepers are generally defined as those who regularly get less than six hours' sleep and long sleepers generally more than nine or 10 hours' a night. Pre-puberty, children are recommended to get as much as 11 hours' sleep a night, however, and up to 18 hours a day for newborn babies. Teenagers should sleep for up to 10 hours a night. Shane O'Mara, professor of experimental brain research at Trinity College Dublin, says that, while it's difficult to tell whether poor sleep is a cause or a symptom of poor health, these relationships feed off each other. For example, people who are less fit exercise less, which leads people to sleep badly, become exhausted and less likely to exercise, and so on. We do know that chronic sleep deprivation - that is, under-sleeping by an hour or two a night over a period of time - has been linked time and again by scientists to poor health outcomes: you don't have to go for days without sleep to suffer these negative effects. How much can an extra hour's sleep change you? Poor sleep has been linked to a whole range of disorders. A review of 153 studies with a total of more than five million participants found short sleep was significantly associated with diabetes, high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, coronary heart disease and obesity. Studies have shown that depriving people of enough sleep for only a few nights in a row can be enough to put healthy adults into a pre-diabetic state. These moderate levels of sleep deprivation damaged their bodies' ability to control blood glucose levels. Vaccines are less effective when we are sleep deprived, and sleep deprivation suppresses our immune system making us more prone to infection. One study found participants who had fewer than seven hours of sleep were almost three times more likely to develop a cold than those who slept for seven hours or more. People who don't sleep enough also appear to produce too much of the hormone ghrelin, associated with feeling hungry, and not enough of the hormone leptin, associated with feeling full, which may contribute to their risk of obesity. There are also links to brain function and even in the long term to dementia. Prof O'Mara explains that toxic debris builds up in your brain during the course of the day and waste is drained from the body during sleep. If you don't sleep enough, you end up in a mildly concussed state, he says. The impact of sleeping too much is less understood, but we do know it is linked to poorer health including a higher risk of cognitive decline in older adults. 'Box set Britain': Millions skip sleep to binge-watch TV After we fall asleep we go through cycles of ""sleep stages"", each cycle lasting between 60 and 100 minutes. Each stage plays a different role in the many processes that happen in our body during sleep. The first stage in each cycle is a drowsy, relaxed state between being awake and sleeping - breathing slows, muscles relax, the heart rate drops. The second stage is a slightly deeper sleep - you may feel awake and this means that, on many nights, you may be asleep and not know it. Stage three is deep sleep. It is very hard to wake up during this period because it is when there is the lowest amount of activity in your body. Stages two and three together are known as slow wave sleep which is usually dreamless. After deep sleep we go back to stage two for a few minutes, and then enter dream sleep, also called REM (rapid eye movement). As the name suggests, this is when dreaming happens. In a full sleep cycle a person goes through all the stages of sleep from one to three, then back down to two briefly, before entering REM sleep. Later cycles have longer periods of REM, so cutting sleep short has a disproportionately large effect on REM. Shift work has been associated with a host of health problems. Researchers have foundshift workers who get too little sleepat the wrong time of day may be increasing their risk of diabetes and obesity. Shift workers are significantly more likely to report ""fair or bad"" general health,externalaccording to a 2013 NHS study, which also found people in this group were a lot more likely to have a ""limiting longstanding illness"" than those who don't work shifts. People who work shifts are significantly more likely to take time off sick, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics. There is a far bigger gap for non-manual workers than manual workers - lack of sleep seems to have a bigger impact on those doing more sedentary jobs. To judge from media reports, you'd think we were in the grip of a sleeplessness epidemic. But are we really all more sleep deprived than before? A big piece of research looking at data from 15 countries found a very mixed picture. Six showed decreased sleep duration, seven increased sleep duration and two countries had mixed results. Lots of a evidence suggests the amount we sleep hasn't changed that much in recent generations. Butif you ask people how sleep deprived they think they are,external, a different picture emerges. So why do so many people report feeling tired? It may be that this problem is concentrated in certain groups, making the trend harder to pick up on a population-wide level. Sleep problems vary considerably by age and gender, according to one study of 2,000 British adults. It found women at almost every age have more difficulty getting enough sleep than men. The sexes are more or less level at adolescence but women begin to feel significantly more sleep deprived than men during the years where they may have young children, while work may become more demanding. The gap then shrinks again later in life. Caffeine and alcohol both affect sleep duration and quality. And later nights and more social activities mean some of us are getting less rest, despite having the same number of hours of sleep, according to Prof Derk-Jan Dijk, of the University of Surrey's sleep research centre. Some people may also sleep too little during the week and catch up at the weekend, bringing the average up but leaving those people feeling sleep deprived. Adolescents are particularly at risk of becoming sleep deprived, according to Prof Dijk. Aside from a few outliers - Margaret Thatcher could apparently get by on only four hours a night - people tend to go to bed in the late evening for around seven or eight hours. But this wasn't necessarily always the norm according to Roger Ekirch, a history professor at Virginia Tech in the USA. He published a paper in 2001 drawn from 16 years of research. His subsequent book, At Day's Close, contained a wealth of historical evidence suggesting that hundreds of years ago, humans in many parts of the world slept in two distinct chunks. Dr Ekirch uncovered more than 2,000 pieces of evidence in diaries, court records and literature which suggest people used to have a first sleep beginning shortly after dusk, followed by a waking period of a couple of hours, then a second sleep. The myth of the eight-hour sleep He thinks this means the body has a natural preference for segmented sleep. Not all scientists agree. Other researchers have found hunter-gatherer communities in the modern world who sleep in one block despite not having electric lighting. This suggests sleeping in two blocks is not necessarily our default. According to Dr Ekirch the shift from biphasal to monophasal sleep happened in the 19th Century because domestic lighting pushed bedtimes later with no corresponding change in rising time, improved lighting changed the human body clock, and the industrial revolution put a greater emphasis on productivity and efficiency. Sleep experts say teenagers need up to 10 hours sleep a night,,externalbut almost half don't get this much according to the NHS. Bedrooms are supposed to be a place of rest but are increasingly filled with distractions like laptops and mobile phones, making it harder for young people to nod off. We have more different types of entertainment on offer than ever, making the temptation to stay awake greater. The blue light emitted by electronic devices makes us feel less sleepy. And the activity itself  - be it talking to friends or watching TV - stimulates our brain when it should be winding down. Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference recommend a nightly ""digital detox"", putting mobile devices away for 90 minutes before lights out. Last year the two organisations commissioned a poll which founda high proportion of young people check their phones after going to bed. More people are turning up at their doctors complaining of problems sleeping. Analysing data collected by NHS England, the BBC found in June that the number of sleeping disorder tests had increased every year over the past decade. There are a number of factors, but the biggest is probably the rise in obesity, according to Dr Guy Leschziner, a consultant neurologist at Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital's Sleep Disorders Centre. The most common and fastest-growing complaint he sees is obstructive sleep apnoea - where the airway collapses and people stop breathing in their sleep -  and this is strongly related to weight. The media has also played a role because people are more likely to go to their GPs having read an article or searched for their symptoms online, he says. The recommended treatment for insomnia iscognitive behavioural therapy,,externaland doctors are increasingly aware that they shouldn't be prescribing sleeping pills. But many still do because it's difficult to access non-drug based treatments, particularly outside big cities. Body Clock: What makes you tick? One study looked at sleep habits in 20 industrialised countries. It found variations of up to an hour in the time people went to bed and woke up, but overall sleep duration was fairly constant across countries. Generally, if a population on average went to bed later, they woke up later too, although not in every case. Researchers have concluded that social influences - hours worked, timing of school, leisure habits - play a far bigger role than the natural cycle of light and dark. In Norway, where the period of lightness each day varies through the year from zero to 24 hours, sleep duration throughout the year only varies on average by about half an hour. Both in countries like the UK, where dusk and dawn times vary considerably across the seasons, and in countries closer to the Equator where dusk and dawn times vary minimally, sleep duration remains constant through the year. But what about the impact of artificial light? A study of three communities who had no access to electricity, in Tanzania, Namibia and Bolivia, found the average sleep duration was 7.7 hours - in step with industrialised countries. So sleep duration seems remarkably consistent throughout the world - it's the time we all go to bed and wake up that varies slightly. These pre-industrialised communities did not fall asleep as soon as it got dark, but around three hours after sunset and generally woke before sunrise. Most studies in this area suggest that artificial light delays sleep time but does not necessarily decrease overall sleep duration. There have always been morning people and evening people. We even have genetic evidence that backs this up. But the introduction of artificial light appears to have exacerbated this effect, particularly for people who prefer to stay up late. If you are already inclined towards being a night owl, artificial light will make you stay up even later. About 30% of us tend towards being morning people and 30% towards being evening people, with the other 40% of us somewhere in the middle - although marginally more people prefer early rising to late nights. We do have some control over our body clocks, however. Those who are naturally late to bed and late to rise can try reducing their exposure to light in the evenings and making sure they get more light exposure in the daytime. A team of researchers took a group of volunteers camping in Colorado, where they had no access to artificial light. Only 48 hours was enough to shift the campers' body clocks forward by almost two hours. Levels of melatonin, the hormone that tells our body to prepare for sleep, began rising earlier in the volunteers - their bodies were preparing for sleep much closer to sunset.

Group of octopuses spotted on beach,"This video can not be played Octopuses 'walking out of the sea' on the Welsh coast A group of octopuses were seen walking along a Ceredigion beach on Friday night, surprising experienced sea-goers. Brett Stones, who runs dolphin tours in Cardigan Bay, saw as many as 25 curled octopuses on New Quay beach as he returned from a day at sea. ""It was a bit like an end of days scenario,"" he said. ""There were probably about 20 or 25 on the beach. I have never seen them out of the water like that."" Numbers of curled octopuses, which measure about 20in (0.5m) in length, have increased off the coast of Wales a due to the decline in cod populations. They are also a common prey for dolphins. But it is very unusual for any to end up on land. Mr Stones, 39, who has spent most of his life at sea and runs tours for SeaMÃ´r dolphin watching, said: ""Maybe they are getting confused by the bright lights in New Quay harbour and maybe they are dying off after summer or getting knackered after the recent storms. ""We have got lobster pots and sometimes octopus will strip the bait, but they are very sneaky. ""It is really rare to see them."" The first octopus seen on Friday night on New Quay beach Mr Stones said he helped collect those that were completely out of the water and returned them to the sea. Unfortunately, despite their best efforts, a number of the octopuses were found washed up on the beach on Saturday morning.

Iceland votes following paedophile row,"Ms JakobsdÃ³ttir says she wants to use Iceland's economic boom to fund investment Iceland's main centre-right party looks set to remain the largest in a snap election called after a scandal over a paedophile toppled the coalition. Despite significant losses, PM Bjarni Benediktsson's Independence Party is ahead of the Left-Green Movement as votes are counted. But with other coalition parties losing ground it was still unclear who would get a mandate to form a government. Iceland's second snap election in a year was held amid deep voter distrust. The row that brought down the government erupted after it emerged that Mr Benediktsson's father had written a letter saying the paedophile should have his ""honour restored"". Most of the parties say investment is needed in welfare, infrastructure and tourism but disagree about how to fund it. Pirate Party MP forced to wear eyepatch With more than half of the votes counted: TheIndependence Partyhas about 25%. It has said it wants to fund infrastructure spending by taking money out of the banking sector. It has been part of every ruling coalition since 1980, except during the 2009-2013 economic crisis TheLeft-Green Movementis on 17%. Led by 41-year-old KatrÃ­n JakobsdÃ³ttir, it wants to use the country's economic boom to fund investment and restore trust in government TheSocial Democratic Allianceis on course to almost double its vote share with nearly 13%, potentially giving it a key role in coalition talks Former PM Gunnlaugsson (L) and Mr Benediktsson are standing despite their respective controversies The furore over Mr Benediktsson's father's letter relates to an old Icelandic system allowing convicts to have certain civil rights restored if three letters of recommendation from persons of good character are provided. Icelanders were furious at the secret backing for Hjalti SigurjÃ³n Hauksson - convicted in 2004 of raping his stepdaughter almost every day for 12 years from when she was five. He served a five-and-a-half-year jail term. The government has also been accused of an attempted cover-up after it refused to disclose who had written the letter of recommendation. The Bright Future party said it was quitting the three-party coalition over the ""serious breach of trust"". It now appears likely to lose all of its four seats. The island of 340,000 people was one of the countries hit hardest by the 2008 financial crisis but has turned its economy around by focusing on tourism. Last year a tax haven scandal forced the then prime minister to resign. Leaked information from Panama-based law firm Mossack Fonseca showed at the time that PM Sigmundur Gunnlaugsson owned an offshore company with his wife, but had not declared it. Mr Gunnlaugsson has denied wrongdoing and is standing in the current election with his new Centre Party.

Prisoners 'gain vote' and hospitals 'safety crisis',"Some prisoners are to be granted the right to vote, the Sunday Times says The Sunday Times,externalreports that some prisoners are to be granted the right to vote. Under the plans - which the paper says were circulated among ministers last week - prisoners with jail sentences of less than a year, who are let out on day release, would be able to take part in elections. The paper notes that the proposal follows a 12-year dispute with the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled in 2005 that it was a breach of prisoners' rights to deny them the opportunity to vote. A Ministry of Justice spokesman told BBC News that it would not comment on speculation. The Mail on Sunday,externalsays a Brexit minister has confirmed to the paper that he once greeted his secretary with crude language and asked her to buy sex toys. Mark Garnier tells the Mail that his comment was a reference to a television programme, and that asking her to buy sex toys was ""good-humoured high-jinks"". He denies his behaviour constitutes sexual harassment. Senior Conservative donors tellthe Observer,externalthat Theresa May should walk away from Brexit negotiations without an agreement - if the deal offered by the EU is not satisfactory. One, Michael Farmer, who also donated millions to the Leave campaign, believes an unfavourable deal would cause the issue of Europe to ""smoulder"" for another generation. ""'No deal' would free us to take advantage of the many opportunities that would be open to Britain,"" he says. The Observer says the interventions are a sign of growing frustration among pro-Brexit Tories about the pace of negotiations with Brussels. There is widespread coverage of an apology made by Environment Secretary Michael Gove, after he made a joke referencing the Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein, who is facing allegations of sexual assault. There's widespread coverage of an apology made by Environment Secretary Michael Gove At a special edition of the Today programme to mark its 60th anniversary, Mr Gove compared being interviewed by John Humphrys to going into Harvey Weinstein's bedroom. The online newspaper theIndependent,externalsays his comments provoked a ""furious backlash"". The Spectator's gossip columnist Steerpike,externalasks why the same outrage was not directed at Mr Gove's co-interviewee Neil Kinnock, who - during the exchange - remarked that ""John goes way past groping"". The Sunday Mirror,externalreports that nearly half of all troops who failed drugs tests in the first half this year were allowed to stay on. The Mirror believes it is a sign that defence chiefs are softening their zero-tolerance policy on substance abuse. A Ministry of Defence spokesman tells the paper personnel could get a reprieve if they have made ""an uncharacteristic mistake"". But an un-named senior officer says drugs are a problem in the armed forces. The Sunday Telegraph,externalbelieves there is growing evidence that a small but significant number of runners are cheating at amateur races. The paper documents several techniques; performance-enhancing drugs, the taking of short-cuts and the use of so-called ""bib mules"", where competitors give their race number to a faster runner. In an editorial, the Telegraph pins the blame on social media which, it says, encourages showing off, even if if involves a little air-brushing. Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning,external The Sunday Times reports that a group of senior women presenters and editors at the BBC have uncovered ""a string of suspected cases of sexual harassment"".,external They are said to have raised concerns about the conduct of two men. The paper says a 5 live sports broadcaster, George Riley, has been suspended pending an investigation. He hasn't commented and the BBC has not confirmed or denied the report. A BBC spokesman said later: ""We can't comment on individuals but treat any allegations seriously and have processes in place for investigating them."" Meanwhile, the Sun on Sunday says Theresa May is ""sweating"" over a dossier of alleged hounding, propositioning and groping of young women by Tory MPs. The paper claims some of the allegations are against cabinet ministers - forcing the prime minister to reckon with the prospect of an emergency reshuffle. She is said to have held emergency meetings with aides, to draw up a plan of action in case a senior figure is named publicly. The front page of theSunday Telegraph,externalfeatures a warning from the medical director of NHS England that the lack of a central system for ordering changes on safety grounds is leaving patients in danger. In an interview with the paper, Sir Bruce Keogh says the hundreds of organisations within the health service have ""their own views"" and that there should be a ""simpler way"" when action is required. In an editorial, the Telegraph complains that the health service has a ""flawed structure"" that is protected from criticism by an ""our NHS"" moral crusade. It believes ""real change"" will only happen by admitting that other systems are better. In Spain, the Catalan newspaperLa Vanguardia,externalnotices that the word ""independence"" was missing from a televised address by the region's deposed leader, calling for peaceful opposition to direct rule by Madrid. The paper interprets this as a sign that Carles Puigdemont is trying to calm tensions. The news websitePolitico,external, however, believes his remarks ""deepened the stand-off"" with the Spanish government and that the formal surroundings of his pre-recorded address suggest he hasn't accepted being sacked.

Madrid's enforcer for Catalonia,"In the Senate defending policy on Catalonia Thewoman appointed by Madrid to restore Spanish rule in Cataloniais seen as a capable politician but one lacking in charisma. In those respects, MarÃ­a Soraya SÃ¡enz de SantamarÃ­a AntÃ³n, 46, mirrors to some extent Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, whom she has served as deputy prime minister since he took office in December 2011. Before entering politics, she was a state lawyer, a member of an elite legal corps serving the state apparatus, and is more than qualified to use the letter of the law against the separatists. Untainted by the corruption scandals which have gripped Mr Rajoy's centre-right Popular Party (PP),  her credentials are impeccable in the eyes of the government. But she will be regarded as an implacable foe by the Catalan nationalist politicians being sacked to make way for direct rule. Catalonia crisis: What next for Spain? What powers does Catalonia have? Ms SÃ¡enz de SantamarÃ­a was born an only child on 10 June 1971 in the north-western city of Valladolid, the medieval seat of the monarchs of Castile. After studying law at the city's university, she passed a tough public contest to become a state lawyer at the age of 27. After the August terror attacks she appeared in Barcelona alongside Mr Rajoy (to her left) and other national and regional leaders She was first elected as an MP at the 2004 general election,externalwhich saw the PP crash out of power over its mishandling of the Madrid terror attack. She became the government spokeswoman in parliament when the party finally returned to power under Mr Rajoy in 2011, on the promise of restoring the economy after the 2008 global banking crisis. The year 2011 was significant in her personal life too, when she gave birth to her first and only child, a son, just weeks before the election. The fact she had returned to work within 11 days of becoming a mother raised some eyebrows,the UK's Daily Telegraph reported at the time,external, but was defended by others. ""If Soraya had stayed at home for four months it would have been irresponsible,"" Nuria Chinchilla, a professor at the IESE business school, was quoted as saying. ""We are suffering extraordinary times in Spain and [she has] an extraordinary job to do."" As deputy prime minister, she was briefly acting minister of justice and minister of health. More importantly, she has been minister of territorial administrations since November 2016. In that post, she has been responsible for the national government's relations with Catalonia and the other autonomous regions. Facing the press pack in Madrid ""She has been very present in Catalonia during the last year as some kind of 'special envoy' so we can expect she knows both the terrain and the actors,"" Manuel Arias-Maldonado, political science professor at MÃ¡laga University, told BBC News. On the day before the government imposed direct rule, she declared in an uncompromising speech about Catalonia: ""We have to rescue it."" ""The independence leaders have shown their true face - they have promised a dream but are performing tricks,"" she told a Spanish Senate hearing. Now she has the Herculean task of persuading the estimated two million Catalans who voted for independence on 1 October that they were misguided. Is she up to it? She is clearly Mr Rajoy's preferred crisis manager, deployed to handle such diverse challenges as an Ebola episode in 2014 and the Germanwings plane crash in 2015, a recentReuters profile,externalnotes. In 2015,USA Today picked her out as one of the five ""most powerful women"" in Europe,external. While she was ""not the world's most electrifying political speaker"", she came over as ""the most popular minister in an unpopular government"", the American paper noted. ""Views on her are unavoidably polarised,"" says Arias-Maldonado. ""As a woman from the centre-right, she is not much praised by feminist lefties despite her feminist merits but generally she is seen as capable, although some see her as ultimately ineffective. ""Overall, though, I would say she retains the image of a capable female politician."" According toa Huffington Post listicle on Ms SÃ¡enz de SantamarÃ­a,externalfrom 2015, which reveals her as a fan of Amy Winehouse and Coldplay among other things, she possesses a collection of gloves. As she embarks on the biggest test of her political career to date, one assumes that whatever gloves she chooses for Barcelona, they may come off very quickly.

Reality Check: Is there a butter crisis in France?,"Can it really be true that the French are running out of butter? That the country with the second biggest dairy sector in Europe (after Germany) is incapable of providing households with such basic culinary fare? The answer is yes... and no. Yes - there are indeed butter shortages in French shops.  Shelves are emptying.  Supermarket own-brands have become scarce, and often it is only possible to find more expensive varieties for sale. A sign in my local supermarket reads: ""The butter market is facing an unprecedented shortfall in raw materials which is causing supply problems to this store."" There is no butter crisis. If you need butter, you will find it.  But it is obvious to all that the system is not functioning as it should do. Something is going wrong. The experts have ascribed several causes. The world market for butter has gone into overdrive. The Chinese in particular have discovered a taste for Western-style pastries,  which require butter as an essential ingredient. At the same time, European and American consumers are moving back to butter. After years in which we were told animal fat was bad, today the advice is changing.   Now, the demon is sugar. Butter has been rehabilitated, and we can spread with pride. Just as demand for butter is rising on the world market, supply is falling. According to the EU's Milk Market Observatory,New Zealand, the world's largest dairy producer, exported 11% less butter between January and August than it did the year before.,external French dairy farmers are producing less butter than they were last year. And in the EU, there are specific problems. The end of milk quotas in 2015 led to an immediate rush to produce dairy. But that triggered a collapse in milk prices, which drove some producers back out of the market. There has also been a question of poor weather - 2016 was not a good year in France for growing animal feed and that means lower milk yields in 2017. With demand for butter rising and supply falling, the result is self-evident. Prices head north. Indeed over the last year and a half, the price went from â¬2,500 (Â£2,200) a tonne in April 2016, to â¬6,500 in September 2017. But these factors are not purely French. Every country in the world has to cope with these market changes. Why is it only in France we see the spaces in the racks? There is a simple answer to that - rigidities in France's system of pricing and distribution. In other countries like Germany, supermarkets have responded to the changing world butter market by putting up their prices.  In France, the cost to the shopper of a pack of butter has barely changed. This is because butter prices are set annually in France, in negotiations between supermarkets and producers.  The next round of talks is not due until February, so until then the supermarkets are only offering to pay what was agreed nine months ago - when butter was much cheaper. There is butter in France - but it isn't finding its way to these supermarket shelves. French producers are not foolish. They can see that the world market is much more attractive than the domestic market. So they are saying ""non"" to the supermarkets, and selling their stock abroad. So this is why the answer to the question - is there a shortage of butter in France? - is both yes and no. No, there is no lack of butter.  France still makes plenty of it. However the butter is now going to places other than where the householder expects to buy it. So yes,  there is a lack of butter.

Review: Harry Styles's solo tour hits Europe âââââ,"After seven years in One Direction, Harry Styles is on his first solo world tour. Will Gompertz has been to see him in Paris before the singer hits the UK this weekend. It is 20:59 on a warm October evening in Paris. It's warmer still inside the legendary L'Olympia music hall on the Boulevard des Capucines; the walls of which can tell tales of other hot nights, with Edith Piaf in the 50s, the Stones and the Beatles in the 60s, followed by Bowie, Madonna, The Grateful Dead, Nina Simone - anyone who's anyone, basically. The 2,000 highly excited young fans (the audience is entirely female, barring the odd dad chaperone and your correspondent) waiting in a state of tremulous expectation for the night's show to begin, couldn't care less about the venue's past. They are here for one thing, and one thing only: to be part of their own piece of history. At 21:00 precisely, a sea of smartphones appear above the canopy of teenage heads. A chant breaks out. ""Harry! Harry! Harry!"" This lot expect things to start on time. A thin, makeshift curtain, decorated with a few spring flowers, obscures the stage. When it ripples, the crowd gasps. When a spotlight reveals a silhouette of a figure holding a guitar, the screaming starts. When it drops to reveal that figure to be Harry Styles standing in front of a microphone, wearing a floral red Gucci suit, an ear-splitting hysteria breaks out. The crowd surge forward. This is what happens when the 23-year-old singer walks into a room. ""Tell me something I don't already know,"" he sings. There's nothing they don't already know about his song Ever Since New York, or any of the other tracks on his recently released first solo album. Two thousand voices joyously sing along. Styles is supported by a four-piece band: Sarah Jones on drums, Clare Uchima on keyboard, Adam Pendergast on bass, Mitch Rowland on lead guitar. They too are decked out from head-to-toe in Gucci. Jones - a visual and sonic presence throughout - is elevated on a raised platform just behind The Main Man. They make a tight combo. The stage set is modest, just a ruched red curtain backdrop. This is an intimate gig. The first stop on a credential-building European tour aimed at establishing Styles as a bona-fide pop star, not some wannabe pretender from a manufactured boy band. He keeps it simple. There is something of a young Johnny Cash about him at this stage. A solid, surprisingly modest performer singing his catchy tunes with confidence and sincerity while rooted to the spot. And so it goes, with a ""bonsoir"" here and ""you're all beautiful"" there. Until Only Angel, when the red curtain backdrop gives way to a mighty lighting stack which becomes the show's sixth performer, throwing the sort of choreographed shapes that Styles was once instructed to do in One Direction but now appears to have happily abandoned. He takes it up a notch. Mic in hand, he channels his inner Jagger and performs the moves he must have rehearsed a thousand times in front of his bedroom mirror: the strut, the clap, the pout. He nails them all without ever really letting go. ""Everybody's alright?"" he asks [The audience screams.] ""Who's from Paris?"" [The audience screams.] ""Who's not from Paris?"" [The audience screams.] Audience and performer are simpatico, hard wired. This is a love-in. It is not rock'n'roll. There's no anger, no wildness, no danger. It is polished, professional entertainment. The singer's early Cash-like cool ebbs as his self-deprecating patter and well-meaning instructions to ""be kind"" and ""embrace someone you don't know"" pitches him somewhere between a Sunday school teacher and a shiny-suited children's entertainer. And then the chants begin. Not for Harry this time, but for one of his songs, Kiwi. Styles smiles. And diverts. To his past and One Direction. Which he embraces, acknowledges, and respects. He is classy. As is his re-working of the band's early hit What Makes You Beautiful. The place goes wild. But they want Kiwi more. So he gives it to them. And they go wilder. ""I think she said, 'I'm having your baby, it's none of your business'."" The crowd swoons and screams. And then, a couple of numbers later, his time is almost up. ""I only have one song left,"" he says. Up go the chants again, ""Kiwi! Kiwi! Kiwi!"" He laughs, resists and sings Sign Of The Times instead. And then waves goodbye and exits stage right, before returning, to touch his heart, and leave again. Tears and more screams fill the air. The band plays on. A little later, when I leave, a large crowd of young women are waiting patiently outside. One of them asks if Harry is still in the venue. I'd been with his team and knew he was long gone. I tell her so. ""But how do I know that I can believe you?"" she asks. I shrug. The truth is Styles had probably jumped into a waiting car while the band was still looping Sign Of The Times and the crowd was holding its collective breath desperately hoping for another encore. Such are the practicalities of showbiz. I don't know how much longer they waited, but I do know every one of the 2,000 fans who crammed into that 19th Century music hall and made it shake to its foundations, had got their money's worth. They got what they came for - their piece of history. As for Harry Styles, he seemed to have a ball too. He clearly loves the freedom of being his own man, doing his own thing. Which he does with oodles of charm and notable technical assurance. He is very good. Albeit still a work in progress. He's still too cautious to match Robbie Williams's post-boy band artistic heights, nor can he yet take his place among the greats whose ghosts haunt L'Olympia. But he is - as they say in Paris - en route.

How a British blogger shook Australia's government,"This video can not be played Barnaby Joyce: 'I was born just there' It is the scandal that unseated a deputy prime minister and left Australia's government teetering on a knife edge. On Friday a court ruled that Barnaby Joyce, leader of the junior party in the governing conservative coalition and deputy prime minister, was invalid. Henow faces a by-electionthat could threaten the government's slim majority. A British blogger who uncovered Mr Joyce's status as a dual national stressed that this was not his intention when he began probing into the politician's background. ""I was never out to get the deputy prime minister,"" William Summers told the BBC from his home in Melbourne. ""I've always said he shouldn't lose his seat. But, if you are going to have this rule, you have got to treat everyone the same."" How did a dual citizenship crisis befall an immigrant nation? Who are the MPs caught up in the dual citizenship saga? At the heart of the crisis is a 114-year-old law which many think is outdated - including Mr Summers, a former assistant to UK Liberal Democrat MP Norman Lamb. ""The constitution had this rule about people not being able to have dual nationalities,"" he said. ""It has been in there all the time. Successive governments have known it is a problem, but they kicked it into the long grass."" However, things came to a head earlier this year when two Greens politicians were forced to resign within four days of each other after discovering they held dual citizenship, both having been born abroad. William Summers was born in Britain, but has made his home in Australia The Australian press, sensing more potential scalps, began checking the citizenship status of all MPs born abroad. Mr Summers, who was born in Norfolk in eastern England but moved to Melbourne a couple of years ago, decided to go a little deeper. After all, people could inherit nationality - people like Australia-born Mr Joyce, whose father was born in New Zealand. It was a hunch, but it turned out to be a good one. One man's march for indigenous rights Ugg: The battle over an iconic Australian boot ""I very soon realised he had made no mention of renouncing his New Zealand citizenship,"" said Mr Summers, a communications manager at Monash University in Melbourne. After a bit more digging, the New Zealand government was forced to come to the same conclusion, giving Mr Summers, 40, a good post for his blog. His discovery didn't go unnoticed: ""Within three days, I had 30,000 hits - it basically went viral."" The blog was published on 28 July. By 14 August,Mr Joyce was forced to stand up in Australia's parliamentand admit that his election may not have been entirely legal. ""I was shocked about this,"" he told MPs. ""Neither I, nor my parents have ever had any reason to believe I may be a citizen of another country."" The election of (clockwise from top left) Larissa Waters, Scott Ludlam, Fiona Nash and Malcolm Roberts was also ruled invalid But Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull remained bullish about his coalition partner being cleared by the courts - even after criticising the opposing Greens for their ""incredible sloppiness"" in allowing two dual nationals to be elected. The judges, however, did not share Mr Turnbull's views and, on 27 October, disqualified Mr Joyce and four other politicians. That pushed the prime minister's parliamentary majority to the edge. Although this was not the outcome Mr Summers was looking for, it has led to Mr Summers being nominated for scoop of the year at the Walkley Awards, Australia's answer to the Pulitzer Prizes. He is the first blogger to be nominated, but he isn't planning on giving up the day job just yet. ""I've known a few journalists - it's a lot of hard work, and not very well paid,"" he observed. But what about becoming an MP himself? Mr Summers was the Liberal Democrats' candidate in North West Norfolk in 2010, coming second to the incumbent Conservative MP. It might not be on his to-do list right now, but he notes: ""If I did have any parliamentary ambitions, I would certainly make sure I was in line with the rules - which is all that people ask.""

The racist nightclub ordered to change its ways,"This video can not be played Pollyanna's in Birmingham was told to open its doors to all Until 1965, it was legal to turn away black people from pubs or clubs simply because of their colour. But it would be more than a decade before a Birmingham nightclub was issued with the first non-discrimination notice of its kind, ordering it to open its doors to all. In the spring of 1978, the inaugural Rock Against Racism (RAR) gig was held in front of tens of thousands of people, a movement that wasinspired by a drunken speech by Eric Clapton,externalat a gig in Birmingham two years earlier. Yet in the same city, a popular nightclub was unashamedly turning people away on the grounds of race. Months later in November 1978, Pollyanna's was ordered by the Commission for Racial Equality to open its doors to both black and Chinese people. Regardless, it continued to enforce its door policy - flying in the face of movements such as RAR anddespite the changes to the law,externalenshrined in three successive Race Relations Acts. ""I think we have to limit all sorts of people, and coloured people fit into that category,"" the club's manager Jeffrey Weston-Edwards told the BBC at the time. Walton Wilkins remembers going to the club in Newhall Street in the early 1980s. He says he was made to sign in, while his white friend walked freely into the venue. News of the crackdown on Pollyanna's made the front page of the Birmingham Mail ""When I got there first they said 'can you sign the book?' and I didn't think anything of it. My friend went walking in and I said 'you've got to sign the book' and they said he didn't have to. ""We just couldn't work it out and we saw it happen when another black guy came in - it was only the black people [who had to sign in]."" The experience, says Mr Wilkins, now 54 and still living in Birmingham, left him in ""shock"". ""It was my first experience of it going out,"" he said. ""It was the first nightclub I had been to and it left a lasting memory."" While he never returned to the venue while it was still Pollyanna's, he recalls ""it was well-known that it was an openly racist club"". David Hinds, lead vocalist of Birmingham reggae band Steel Pulse, also remembers the club's racist policy. ""I do remember going to Pollyanna's in the mid-70s. I went there, but it was an all-white nightclub at the time, probably had one of those 'limited amount of black people attending' [policies]. ""Pollyanna's was a club known for that."" Birmingham reggae band Steel Pulse remembers the policy at Pollyanna's The club was investigated after two separate complaints But the situation wasn't just limited to Pollyanna's, with other clubs in the city having similar policies in the 1970s,Mr Hinds told BBC World Service's Witness programme. ""There was a lot of [those] scenarios happening in the clubs,"" he added. ""Some of them weren't there in writing on a placard outside the club, but they were pretty much there. ""Some of the clubs had policies where there were no blacks or there were blacks that were of a limited amount, or we had to have a certain attire. ""Some clubs had the policy where you were only invited certain days of the week."" Jeff Weston-Edwards told the BBC at the time that the club must limit ""all sorts of people"" Dr Peter Sanders was director of the Commission for Racial Equality (CRE) at the time Pollyanna's was issued the order, later becoming the organisation's chief executive. He said the club's behaviour would have been ""fairly common"" across the country at that time, describing it as ""fairly widespread"". Race relations in the 1970s were ""much more raw than they are now"", Dr Sanders said. And it wasn't just clubs discriminating on the grounds of race. ""[There were] some employers who didn't employ blacks at all, and the way they did it was they recruited through word-of-mouth and that way, they said they 'kept themselves as one happy family'. So that way they didn't turn any blacks down for work, but blacks never applied."" At Pollyanna's, once the notice was issued, owners had to provide evidence they were complying with the order for two years, or face prosecution. However, Mr Weston-Edwards said at the time that it would have no effect on the club. He told the BBC he had to limit the numbers of ethnic minorities to preserve a ""happy situation"" and avoid aggressive confrontations. ""We will operate as we have done for the last 10 years in exactly the same way,"" he said. Maxie Hayles has campaigned against racism in Birmingham for many years The 1970s was one of the worst times for racism we had in Britain as black people. You not only had the recession under the various governments at the time, but what we had was the issues around racial terrorism - because it was terror - name calling and actual physical attacks. The Race Relations Act was feeble. It wasn't an easy time for black people. The first act didn't address social issues such as social housing. During that time, because the racism was so bad, there were very few places that black people were allowed because of the colour bar, so people had to resort to creating [their] own entertainment and places to go to. The 1980s were when things began to change. The investigation that eventually led to the non-discrimination notice had been prompted by two complaints against the venue. The first was from the sales manager of a local cosmetics company who tried to book Pollyanna's for a Christmas party. But the reservation was refused after bosses discovered a large proportion of the group were black. In the second case, a university lecturer was told she could not take a group of students to Pollyanna's because they were Chinese. Protests were held at DSTRKT club in 2015 over claims women were turned away due to their race The club's management said they barred both white and black people if they disapproved of their attitude or the way they were dressed. It's a method that is still being used on doors as a way of controlling entry, according to Kimberley McIntosh, policy officer at race equality think tank, the Runnymede Trust. Controversial door entry policies are ""not something that with time has changed as much as we hoped"", she said. More content from Black History Month: The man who broke rugby's racial barrier Oxford University's first black student Celebrating black and Asian life in England Ms McIntosh cites the example of claims - which were denied -that London nightclub DSTRKT turned away women for being ""overweight"" and too dark"". And it is often the case that clubs use more discreet ways to police their doors and cases of ""quite coded language to circumvent the law"", she added. ""[We are] also seeing 'dressed appropriately', which is something that's used quite often now, even though people have followed all the dress code rules."" ""Another recent one is [a] Grenfell fundraiser in Shoreditch,"" she said. ""Once the [venue] found out the music would be urban,it was immediately cancelled, saying it would be a 'poor demographic'."" Ms McIntosh said it was an example of ""linking certain types of music with a certain crowd and violence"". Kimberley McIntosh from the Runnymede Trust says people are still being discriminated against by nightclubs As for Pollyanna's, after monitoring the club's race equality record for another year the CRE took the owners to court in 1979. The court imposed injunctions stopping them from practising discrimination, and also ordered them to produce information to the CRE proving they had complied. After the judgement, it emerged there was also a no-headgear rule at the nightspot which effectively excluded Sikhs as well. This was not covered by the original non-discrimination notice, so the CRE had to go back to court to get the notice reworded. An injunction was finally issued against this rule too. Dr Peter Sanders was director of the CRE at the time Pollyanna's was issued the order Dr Sanders said it is understood the club complied with the injunctions - although the experience of Mr Wilkins would suggest otherwise. Pollyanna's eventually closed in 1987 when Genture Restaurants Ltd was dissolved - the building is now occupied by Michelin-starred chef Glynn Purnell's restaurant. Ultimately, says Mr Hinds, the changes to, and enforcement of, the law had a positive impact on race relations in Britain. ""At the end of the day, for you to learn of someone's culture, it's always best to have it in a social environment and where else is better to learn of someone than in places where you can sit down and have a drink or have a meal, socialise by dancing, [or] by having conversations round the table? ""I think it was most important because for you to have races and cultures having an understanding and having racial harmony, those were the environments and the outlets that were accessible to all of us. ""You find once you are in an environment like that and you are socialising, people see it as a template that when it comes to other areas... jobs... housing... they realise that once you open the barrier for one thing, the barrier will be lifted in other areas. ""To me, it promotes racial harmony and this is what the world needs today."" DSTRKT 'condemns any type of racism' Are some clubs running a racist door policy?

Polish doctors on hunger strike in healthcare row,"The doctors' hunger strike began on 2 October Medics know better than most about the long-term damage a hunger strike does to the human body. Yet junior doctors in Poland have felt compelled to take just such drastic action in order to make their voices heard. About to enter their fifth week on hunger strike, the 20 doctors at Warsaw's Paediatric Hospital are losing hope that the government will agree to their demands for more government spending on the country's health services. They say healthcare is on its knees and they are being overworked. Dr Matyja says the protesters' demands ""are being met with a financial brick wall"" Dr Piotr Matyja was one of the first doctors to join the protest. He was also among the longest lasting, giving up food for 12 days before being ""disqualified"" by fellow protesters on medical grounds. Having regularly worked 80 hours a week he says: ""I have seen from the front line what is happening to Poland's health services. ""Doctors want to care for their patients - but we are being met with a financial brick wall that is stopping us. Don't Poles deserve a decent health service?"" Last year, the Polish government spent 4.4% of the country's GDP on health services. That puts it among some of the lowest-spending countries, according to the intergovernmental economic organisation OECD - just above Turkey (3.4%) and Latvia (3.2%). Warsaw doctors' rally - and the protest has spread to other cities Figures for 2016 show that the German government contributed the highest percentage of its GDP to health services - 9.5% - and Sweden was in second place, spending 9.2%. Poland's junior doctors are calling for a steady increase up to 6.8% of GDP by 2021. The Polish government has held talks with the doctors. Health Minister Konstanty Radziwill met them last week and promised an increase to 6% of GDP by 2025, under a proposal approved by the government. But he also condemned the strike, warning that ""one should not toy with the health and life of patients"". Patrycja Pieczka (L) and Malgorzata Koziel say they have no option but to resort to the strike The government's offer was dismissed as ""unrealistic"" by Dr Joanna Matecka. Speaking on behalf of the doctors, she accused the government of ""not treating us seriously, they are not outlining any realistic proposals, they just want us to stop the hunger strike"". Dr Patrycja Pieczka and Dr Malgorzata Koziel, both on their fourth day without food, are quick to point out that they are not neglecting their patients. ""I feel so strongly about this I have used all of my leave to be here. I am not missing out on work. I don't want this to impact on my patients. I will simply not get a vacation anytime soon,"" Dr Pieczka says. Dr Koziel adds: ""We have been holding protests for the past two years, reaching out to the government, highlighting the dire state of the health service, but with no response. So we feel there is no option but to resort to a hunger strike."" The junior doctors also want less bureaucracy and a pay rise. Striking doctors are regularly checked by other physicians, and sometimes are ""disqualified"" on medical grounds Currently after seven years of studying and working on the wards a junior doctor in Poland can expect to take home around 1,833 zloty ($500; Â£381) a month, roughly the cost of renting a small flat in the capital Warsaw. By comparison a British junior doctor can expect a basic starting salary of Â£1,910 ($2,500) a month. The number of doctors abstaining from food always remains at about 20. They are regularly checked by other physicians who volunteer their time in support of this cause. When one person is deemed medically unfit to continue they are ""disqualified"" and replaced by another volunteer. The hunger strike has spread, with doctors also taking part in Szczecin, Leszno, Lodz, Gdansk, Krakow and Wroclaw.

How Facebook saved a dying mill town,"A mill town with high unemployment has seen its fortunes changed by Facebook's need for data servers. But will the town have to radically change to save itself? The people of Prineville live deep in a valley surrounded by dense forests. In the 1800s, it was the first place in central Oregon where white settlers drove out Native Americans to start a city. Steve Forrester's grandparents got here in 1902. When he was growing up in the 1970s, Prineville felt idyllic. ""It was a magical, magical place to grow up,"" he remembers. ""My dad worked in the sawmill industry as an electrician; my mom didn't work. We all learned to hunt and shoot a gun. ""We all learned how to drive in the forest before we were 16. In the spring, we could snow-ski in the morning and water-ski in the afternoon. ""And everybody had a job, and everyone did well."" Prineville was the largest producer of ponderosa pine in the world. But when the federal government restricted logging and increased protections for animals like the spotted owl, the city's milling industry was decimated. As an adult, Forrester took a job with one of the few remaining mills, because he wanted to live in Prineville. Eric Klann was driven by the same devotion. He's the seventh generation of his family to live here. Out of college, he also took a job in Prineville that he knew wouldn't last. ""There was always a little voice in the back of my head saying, 'What are you doing - you want to be here, but you're in a dying industry,'"" he says. A few years later, the US housing bubble burst and demand declined for parts made by the last mills. Lots of people lost jobs and left. It felt like Prineville couldn't catch a break. One of Prineville's new kind of ""factory"" - a data server farm Both Forrester and Klann felt lucky to land jobs at the city - Forrester as city manager, Klann as city engineer. Their chance to save Prineville arrived in 2009 in the form of a mysterious email from a company called Vitesse. ""For the longest time, we had no idea what Vitesse meant,"" he says. All Klann knew is that Prineville's natural resources made it perfect for a new industry - the information industry, created to save the massive amounts of information people post on the web. Vitesse wanted to build a big warehouse and fill it with rows and rows of servers - servers that tend to get hot. Central Oregon's cold nights could cool them naturally. Klann remembers the first in-person meeting with Vitesse, and how it felt like Prineville's last chance. ""Right before I walked into our conference room to meet with their nine lawyers, I got an email and our unemployment rate had peaked at 23%,"" Klann says. ""I got that email and I walked into that room, and I kept thinking, 'I better not screw this up.'"" Klann and Forrester decided to outperform the other cities Vitesse was considering. They showed the company their small town could move at big-city speed, by responding to Vitesse's questions day and night. ""What we heard back is that other cities weren't doing that,"" Forrester says. Their strategy worked, and in 2010, Prineville finally learned who Vitesse actually was. Unearthing the legacy of Harvard's female 'computers' The coastal Maine town that shipped cows to Turkey The first Irish immigrant deported by Trump US farmers see potential in saffron ""They had the big finger with a thumb-up Facebook sign, and we all pressed the button and it lit up, et cetera,"" Mayor Betty Roppe says, recounting the new data centre's groundbreaking. ""That was the big announcement - it was Facebook."" It was Facebook's first data centre of its own. Mark Zuckerberg was there, and Roppe had planned to give him a cowboy hat to show the city's pride in its cowboy culture. ""Cowboy hats are not cheap. They said, 'Do not get Mark Zuckerberg a cowboy hat. He does not want a cowboy hat.' OK. So, I got him a hoodie. He wears hoodies all the time,"" she says. When she presented the gift, Roppe gave Facebook's founder a kiss on the cheek. ""He just blushed like he wanted to have the floor open up and swallow him."" Mayor Betty Roppe oversaw Prineville's transformation after data centres were built in the city Seven years later, Facebook has two more data centres in Prineville and six others across the world. Apple's moved into Prineville, too - it's built three data centres here. All of them sit high above Prineville's valley, in huge, long, flat buildings painted pale blue and grey so they blend in with the sky. About 500 employees work in the centres, most of them from Prineville. Security's tight, so few other people ever see inside. Despite their low profile, the data centres have had a profound impact. Roppe says the mills taught Prineville a lesson - not to rely on just one industry. So they're putting in things that appeal to lots of employers - like good roads, walking and biking paths, modern wastewater treatment, a new hospital and a state college outpost. But now that the city's successful, officials have a lot more to think about. Like, how do you slow success down? ""We can keep the small-town feel. I'm sure of it,"" Roppe says. ""We don't want to be a big city."" The cost of housing is up, so city officials know they have to build more affordable housing. And Mayor Roppe's own granddaughter, with a college degree, can't find a living wage job. So, they have to keep bringing in new employers. All city manager Forrester can do is calibrate the development carefully. He worries about Prineville changing too much, too. ""We are small-town people. We live the Western lifestyle,"" Forrester says. ""The quiet and peace of central Oregon is a beautiful, beautiful thing, and to be able to make a living here is tremendous."" But Forrester says he's seen that central Oregon towns that don't adapt will die. And he knows they have to risk changing Prineville in order to save it.

Catalan ex-leader vows to resist takeover,"Puigdemont said Madrid's actions were ""premeditated aggression"" Sacked Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont has called for ""democratic opposition"" to direct rule from Madrid. He condemned the suspension of Catalonia's autonomy and promised to continue to ""work to build a free country"". He made the call in a pre-recorded TV address to Catalans broadcast on Saturday afternoon. The Spanish government has stripped Catalonia of its autonomy and taken charge of its government. The measures came early on Saturday after the Catalan parliament voted to declare independence the previous day. Madrid's enforcer for Catalonia This video can not be played Sarah Rainsford met protesters in Madrid who are calling for a united Spain And Spain's interior ministry has taken charge of Catalonia's police after firing senior Catalan police officials. Friday saw Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy announce the dissolution of the regional parliament and the removal of Mr Puigdemont as Catalan leader, and order fresh regional elections in December. An official state bulletin (in Spanish) handed control of Catalonia to Spain's Deputy Prime Minister,external, Soraya Saenz de Santamaria. Demonstrations for and against independence went on into the night, and a large rally ""for the unity of Spain and the constitution"" was held in Madrid on Saturday. Barca coach ducks Catalan questions Catalonia crisis: What next for Spain? EU risks ""more cracks"" appearing In his TV address, Mr Puigdemont, describing the declaration of independence, said Friday had been ""a day with democratic and civic sensibility"". He said the central government's actions since then were ""premeditated aggression"" that ran ""contrary to the expressed will of the citizens of our country, who know perfectly well that in a democracy it is parliaments that choose, or remove, presidents"". He added:  ""We continue persevering in the only attitude that can make us winners. Without violence, without insults, in an inclusive way, respecting people and symbols, opinions, and also respecting the protests of the Catalans who do not agree with what has decided the parliamentary majority."" This video can not be played The moment Catalan parliament declared independence Meanwhile, the Spanish government has said it would welcome the participation of Mr Puigdemont in new elections in the region in December. A Spanish government spokesperson, ÃÃ±igo MÃ©ndez de Vigo, said that despite his removal from office, the separatist leader had the right to continue in politics. ""The Catalans will be able to say what they feel about what they've been seeing in this last year, with all sorts of failing the law, abusing the law and putting themselves outside the law,"" the spokesman added. The crisis was sparked by an independence referendum organised by the Catalan government and held earlier this month in defiance of a ruling by the Constitutional Court which had declared it illegal. The Catalan government said that of the 43% of potential voters who took part, 90% were in favour of independence. Before Madrid took over the Catalan government, the region had one of the greatest levels of self-government in Spain. It has its own parliament, police force and public broadcaster, as well as a government and president, though those have now been dismissed. Catalans had a range of powers in many policy areas,externalfrom culture and environment to communications, transportation, commerce and public safety. Foreign affairs, the armed forces and fiscal policy were always the sole responsibility of the Spanish government. What powers has Catalonia now lost? The case for and against independence Thousands celebrated the declaration of independence on the streets of Barcelona, Catalonia's regional capital. The same crowds that cheered each Yes vote from Catalan MPs reportedly booed Mr Rajoy as he made his announcement. There were pro-unity demonstrations too, with protesters in Barcelona waving Spanish flags and denouncing Catalan independence. A large pro-unity rally is expected in Madrid on Saturday. In other reaction: Barcelona's mayor Ada Colau condemned the move by Madrid, but also criticised Catalan pro-independence parties,externalfor ""advancing at a kamikaze pace...after their mistaken reading of the results of the Catalan elections"" EU President Donald Tusk said Madrid's government ""remains our only interlocutor"" in Spain, but called for restraint The UK government said it did not recognise the declaration of independence by Catalonia. After the 1 October referendum, Mr Puigdemont signed a declaration of independence but delayed implementation to allow talks with the Spanish government. He ignored warnings by the Madrid government to cancel the move, prompting Mr Rajoy to first announce his plans to remove Catalan leaders and impose direct rule. Does Catalonia want to leave Spain? Reality Check: Police violence in Catalonia Catalonia is one of Spain's richest, most distinctive regions, with a high degree of autonomy. Many Catalans feel they pay more to Madrid than they get back, and there are historical grievances, too, in particular Catalonia's treatment under the dictatorship of General Franco. But Catalans have been divided on the question of independence. Are you in Catalonia? What is your reaction to the latest developments?

British man 'charged with being IS member',"Jack Letts, from Oxford, travelled to Syria in 2014 A 21-year-old man from Oxford has been charged with being a member of so-called Islamic State, officials from the Kurdish region of Syria have said. Jack Letts, dubbed ""Jihadi Jack"", travelled to Syria in 2014 and was later captured by the Kurdish-led YPG - the group fighting against IS - when he left IS territory. Officials told the BBC Mr Letts had been captured in May 2017. Mr Letts has previously said he opposes IS. A statement given to the BBC from the Democratic Federation of Northern Syria (DFNS) - a self-declared autonomous region - said Mr Letts had been taken to a prison in Qamishli, northern Syria. It said the case was still under investigation by the local police force, the Asayish. It is the first time Kurdish forces have confirmed the capture of Mr Letts as a prisoner of war. Mr Letts converted to Islam while at Cherwell comprehensive school in Oxford. He travelled to Jordan, aged 18, in 2014, having dropped out of his A-levels. By the autumn of that year he was in IS-controlled territory in Syria. He married in Iraq and now has a child. His parents have denied he went to Syria to fight with IS, and started a petition claiming he had ""disappeared in a Guantanamo-style black site"" in Kurdish-controlled territory. But Sinam Mohamad, the European representative of DFNS, strongly disputed this. She told the BBC that its judicial bodies respected international human rights law and were treating Mr Letts in accordance with the Geneva Convention and international human rights standards. ""We refute all these baseless allegations,"" she said. Sally Lane and John Letts have claimed the UK government has not done enough to help their son Kurdish officials say Mr Letts' parents have previously written to the head of the Asayish regarding a possible transfer of Jack to Canadian authorities. Mr Letts - whose father is Canadian - has a Canadian passport. Officials say the letter said: ""We understand that the Asayish must detain and question anyone they believe might have been involved in violent or extremist activities. ""We also accept that Jack will need to be transferred into Canadian custody for questioning and may be arrested when he arrives in Canada. If he has committed any crimes we believe he should face justice and explain his actions."" ""We are willing to work with the Asayish and the Canadians to help resolve this situation as quietly and as quickly as possible,"" the letter reportedly added. His parents said they were grateful to the Asayish for ""having treated him well according to international standards of human rights"" while in custody. How real is the threat of returning IS fighters? The rise and fall of Islamic State MI5 boss Andrew Parker warns of 'intense' terror threat However, John Letts and Sally Lane say they have had no confirmation Jack is still alive since July. They conducted a week-long ""hunger-strike"" in protest, claiming the British government had not done enough to help their son. Ms Mohamad's statement added: ""The Democratic Federation of Northern Syria's policy with regard to prisoners of war is clear and fair. ""ISIS brought inexplicable levels of terror on the peoples of Northern Syria... ""Despite this fact, the DFNS is not less committed than European countries to treating the fighters from this terror group according to international human rights standards."" The statement has for the first time shed light on the situation regarding the possible handover of Mr Letts to British authorities. It said Kurdish officials were willing to hand over prisoners of war to their original country after being properly investigated. The statement added: ""Jack Letts is currently under investigation by local and global anti-terror units. ""Once the investigation is concluded, the outcome will be communicated to Jack's parents, and their legal representatives and to the officials of relevant governments. ""Therefore, we ask the parents of Jack Letts and their legal representative to ask the UK and Canadian governments to officially request the handover of Jack Letts from the officials of the DFNS so that the handover can proceed officially. ""However, so far there has been no official request from neither Canadian or British governments."" There has been significant debate over what should happen to British IS fighters who are still in Syria. Earlier this week, Rory Stewart, the minister for international development, said those who are there are ""a serious danger to us"". ""Unfortunately the only way of dealing with them will be, in almost every case, to kill them,"" he said. However, security minister Ben Wallace has previously told the BBC that the government's preference is for suspected IS fighters to be returned to the UK to face prosecution. ""We have planned and prepared for the risk posed by British returnees as Daesh (IS) is defeated,"" he said. ""Our ultimate aim is to prosecute, but it's not straightforward."" Mr Letts and Ms Lane havepleaded not guilty to charges of funding terrorismafter being accused of sending cash to their son. Their solicitor has said they have declined to comment. The Foreign Office said: ""The government is unable to provide support to British nationals in Syria as the UK government does not have consular representation there.""

N Korea nuclear threat 'accelerating',"North Korea engaged in ""outlaw"" behaviour, Mr Mattis said The threat of nuclear attack from North Korea is increasing, US Defence Secretary James Mattis said during a visit to South Korea. Mr Mattis warned it would face a ""massive military response"" if it used nuclear weapons. Separately, North Korea released a South Korean fishing boat which it said had been found in North Korean waters illegally. The crew of 10 were released on Friday evening, South Korean officials said. It comes at a time of heightened tension in the region, with both sides running a series of military exercises. Inside the world's most secretive country Decoding North Korea's nuclear Pacific threat The Korea crisis in 300 words ""North Korea has accelerated the threat that it poses to its neighbours and the world through its illegal and unnecessary missile and nuclear weapons programs,"" Mr Mattis said,AP news agency reported,external. He said North Korea engaged in ""outlaw"" behaviour and said US-South Korean security collaboration had taken on ""new urgency"". Washington could not accept a nuclear North Korea, he added, speaking alongside his South Korean counterpart Song Young-moo. The threat of nuclear attack from North Korea is increasing, Mr Mattis says Mr Mattis is in Seoul for annual defence talks with South Korea. US President Donald Trump is due to visit South Korea in November as part of a trip to Asia. In September North Korea carried out itssixth nuclear test, which was its biggest yet. The bomb was thought to have had a power range from 50 to 120 kilotonnes. A 50kt device would be about three times the size of the bomb that destroyed Hiroshima in 1945. It has also carried out a series of missile tests, firing twoballistic missiles over Japanin August and September. South Korea has begun deploying theUS Thaad (Terminal High-Altitude Area Defence)missile defence system in response to the threat of a missile attack from the north. Earlier this month, the US and South Korea also began joint military exercises in waters surrounding the Korean peninsula, involving fighter jets, destroyers and aircraft carriers. The drills anger the North, and Pyongyang has in the past denounced them as a ""rehearsal for war"". Separately, the US has imposed sanctions on seven North Koreans and three entities over ""flagrant"" human rights abuses. Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin said those sanctioned included diplomats placed in China and Vietnam who had taken part in the forced repatriation of North Korean asylum-seekers.

Sopranos actress accuses Weinstein of rape,"The Sopranos star alleges that the producer raped her in New York in 1992 Italian-American actress Annabella Sciorra, who starred in US TV series The Sopranos, has accused disgraced producer Harvey Weinstein of rape. She toldThe New Yorker,externalthat Weinstein forced his way into her New York apartment and assaulted her in 1992. She alleges that he sexually harassed her in the subsequent years. In the article actress Daryl Hannah also says she was harassed by Weinstein. His spokeswoman again said the producer denies claims of non-consensual sex. On Thursdayanother actress, Natassia Malthe, accused the producer of raping her in a London hotel roomin 2008. More than 50 women have now accused Harvey Weinstein of a range of allegations ranging from rape to sexual harassment. Who has accused Weinstein? How the scandal unfolded Weinstein could be stripped of CBE Malthe held a press conference with lawyer Gloria Allred, who is representing a number of Weinstein's accusers Ms Sciorra told the New Yorker's Ronan Farrow that the assault happened in 1992 after she had filmed The Night We Never Met, which Weinstein produced. The producer forced himself into her apartment in New York while she was getting ready for bed after he had dropped her off following a group dinner. She said Weinstein ""pushed the door open"" and refused to leave when asked, before shoving her onto the bed and raping her. ""I struggled, but I had very little strength left in me,"" she said. ""Like most of these women, I was so ashamed of what happened. And I fought. I fought. But still I was like, Why did I open that door?... I felt disgusting."" Charmed and Scream actress Rose McGowan has also accused the producer of rape The actress said she did not report the incident to the police, but alleges her career began to suffer and did not work again until 1995. ""I just kept getting this pushback of 'We heard you were difficult; we heard this or that.' I think that that was the Harvey machine."" She said the producer continued to pursue her, including turning up at her hotel room at the 1997 Cannes Film Festival wearing only his underwear. Actress Daryl Hannah also came forward on 27 October with harassment allegations Actress Daryl Hannah, who starred in Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill series that Weinstein produced, also came forward with new allegations. She said Weinstein tried to force himself into her hotel room when they were promoting Kill Bill and its sequel. The films were written and directed byQuentin Tarantino, who has admitted that he had some prior knowledge of Weinstein's behaviour. Hannah said that on one occasion the producer asked to grope her and then requested that she expose herself. Since claims against him began to surface in early October, Mr Weinstein has joined a sex rehabilitation programme, but he has ""unequivocally denied"" all allegations of non-consensual sex.

Explosions rock Somali capital,"This video can not be played The aftermath of the latest bomb blast in Mogadishu Security forces in the Somali capital, Mogadishu, have ended a 15-hour siege of a hotel stormed by armed militants. The gunmen entered the building after two bombs were detonated in the area. At least 20 people were killed, and it is feared more bodies will be found as security forces search the hotel. The Islamist militant group al-Shabab said it had carried out the bombings. Two weeks ago, 358 people died in the worst attack in Somalia since the group launched its offensive in 2007. The al-Qaeda-linked group denies having any involvement with the 14 October attack, from which another 56 people are still missing. Who are Somalia's al-Shabab? The militants said they had chosen the popular Nasahablod Two hotel for Saturday's attack because it had been frequented by security officials and politicians. Provincial leaders, police and intelligence officials were gathering for a meeting with the government to agree on a joint strategy against al-Shabab, due to take place on Sunday. The siege started in the afternoon after a car bomb was driven into the hotel. A few minutes later, a second explosion happened near the former parliament house nearby. The victims included several policemen who had been stationed close to the hotel's gate, police officer Ali Nur told Reuters news agency. Many more people were injured, according to reports.

Marathon runners tested over ill health,"A record 2,900 runners are taking part in the 2017 race Runners in one of Britain's toughest marathons could help scientists answer why some will fall ill after the race - and others will not. The 35th Snowdonia Marathon on Saturday sees just under 3,000 following the route around the highest peak in Wales. Bangor University researchers are testing the endurance athletes before and after the race. They believe differences in how the body responds to stress could hold the key to the issue. ""While general exercise boosts the immune system, endurance events cause a brief dip in our immunity levels, post-event,"" explained physiologist Prof Neil Walsh. ""Our hunch is that the way in which our body's immune defence works during stress, like a marathon, is to some extent predictable. ""It could be that hard-wired psychological characteristics can predict how our bodies respond."" Cardiff Half sells out Newport to host new marathon Could you run a half marathon? The 26.2 mile (42km) route from Llanberis in Gwynedd takes the runners up the notorious Pen-y-Pass ascent, drops into the spectacular Nant Gwynant valley to Beddgelert, before another epic climb and trail descent back into Llanberis. This year's event has a record number of runners registered - and had to close registration just hours after opening entries on 1 January. It is a fact that some of those taking part will get sick after the race - while others will just shake-off the distance. Many put it down to pre-event training but Bangor University's research is pointing in a completely different direction. ""Recent research here suggests that we are on the right track,"" said PhD student Sophie Harrison. ""It may be that physical and psychological stresses use the same pathways and so our bodies react similarly to physical stresses as they do to emotional stresses. ""We're looking at people's psychological types and at measures of inflammation and immunity that we can trace in saliva. ""These will show how people's bodies are responding to the stress of the marathon. ""We want to see whether it would be possible to predict which individuals are more likely to feel poorly, above and beyond the stresses on their bodies after the race.""

Paul Newman watch sells for record $18m,"The watch had been expected to sell for $1m A Rolex watch belonging to the late Hollywood star Paul Newman has sold for a record price at auction in New York. The watch was given to him by his wife Joanne Woodward as they filmed the 1969 movie Winning together. Newman, who died in 2008 aged 83, later used it to time car races in which he took part. The stainless steel watch was sold to an unnamed telephone buyer for $17.8m (Â£13.6m) - much more than the $1m it had initially been expected to fetch. It is a record for a wristwatch sold at auction, but a Patek Philippe pocket watch sold for more than $24m in 2014. Woodward and Newman in 1958 - before the Rolex was bought In Winning, Newman played a racing car driver, a role which spurred his interest in the sport. He went on to take part in the 24-hour Le Mans race. Before giving him the watch, Woodward had it engraved with the words ""Drive Carefully, Me."" He had been injured in a motorbike accident in 1965. Woodward bought him a new watch in 1984, and he gave the Daytona Rolex to his daughter's then-boyfriend, James Cox. Cox put the watch up for auction. Some of the proceeds will go towards the Nell Newman Foundation, a charity set up by Paul Newman's daughter, and Newman's Own Foundation.

Nuclear sub sailors sacked after drugs tests,"HMS Vigilant is one of Britain's four Vanguard-class submarines Nine sailors from a nuclear missile submarine have been dismissed from the Royal Navy after failing drugs tests, the Ministry of Defence has said. They had been serving aboard HMS Vigilant, which carries the Trident nuclear deterrent. The Daily Mail reported thatthe drug they had taken was cocaine,external. Defence Secretary Michael Fallon is understood to have ordered all UK submarine crews to be tested for drugs. He is said to have given First Sea Lord Admiral Sir Philip Jones a ""roasting"" over the incident. The Royal Navy said it did not tolerate drugs misuse, adding: ""Those found to have fallen short of our high standards face being discharged from service."" Michael Fallon, pictured on a visit to HMS Vigilant in Faslane in 2016, is said to have ordered drugs tests of all UK submarine crews Earlier this month, thesubmarine's captain was relieved of his commandafter an alleged ""inappropriate relationship"" with a member of his crew. The Royal Navy said at the time that an investigation was ongoing and operations were not impacted. The BBC's Jonathan Beale said Vigilant's second-in-command had also been removed over similar allegations. HMS Vigilant is one of Britain's four Vanguard-class submarines which carry up to eight Trident missiles armed with nuclear warheads. The submarine is based at Her Majesty's Naval Base Clyde at Faslane in Argyll and Bute. All Royal Navy vessels have a ""no touching rule"" that prohibits intimate relationships on board.

Spain takes charge of Catalan government,"Spain's Deputy PM Soraya Saenz de Santamaria is now officially in charge of Catalonia The Spanish government has stripped Catalonia of its autonomy and taken charge of its government. The measures came early on Saturday after the Catalan parliament voted to declare independence on Friday. An official state bulletin dismissed Catalan leaders and handed control of Catalonia to Spain's Deputy Prime Minister, Soraya Saenz de Santamaria. Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont has called for ""democratic opposition"" to the takeover. He made the call in a TV address broadcast from an undisclosed location. Earlier, Spain's interior ministry took charge of Catalonia's police after firing senior Catalan police officials. On Friday, PM Mariano Rajoy announced the dissolution of the regional parliament and the removal of the Catalan leader, and called snap local elections. Demonstrations for and against independence went on into the night. A large rally ""for the unity of Spain and the constitution"" is being held in Madrid. Barca coach ducks Catalan questions Catalonia crisis: What next for Spain? EU risks ""more cracks"" appearing The crisis began when Catalan leaders held an independence referendum, defying a ruling by the Constitutional Court which had declared it illegal. The Catalan government said that of the 43% of potential voters who took part, 90% were in favour of independence. Others boycotted the vote after the court ruling. This video can not be played At times there were tensions between opposing sets of demonstrators. On Friday afternoon, the Catalan regional parliament voted to declare independence from Spain. Soon after, the Spanish Senate granted Mr Rajoy's government the power to impose direct rule on Catalonia. It did so early on Saturday by publishingan official bulletin,external(in Spanish) that dismissed Mr Puigdemont and all government members. The announcement came hours after the Madrid government removed Josep LluÃ­s Trapero Ãlvarez as chief of Catalonia's autonomous Mossos police force. Mr Trapero was already under investigation for sedition, accused of failing to help Spain's Guardia Civil police tackle thousands of pro-independence protesters in Barcelona during the run-up to the referendum. He was replaced by Ferran LÃ³pez, his deputy. Pere Soler i Campins, director general of the Mossos, was also dismissed. Large crowds turned out in Madrid on Saturday to support Spanish unity The BBC's Sarah Rainsford, in Madrid, said that implementing the changes is likely to be a complex process for Spanish authorities - and one bound to be met with stiff resistance from those who just voted for independence. Regional elections are scheduled for 21 December. Mr Puigdemont has urged supporters to ""maintain the momentum"" in a peaceful manner, but Spanish prosecutors say they will file charges of ""rebellion"" against him next week. This video can not be played The moment Catalan parliament declared independence Separatists say the independence move means they no longer fall under Spanish jurisdiction. But the Spanish Constitutional Court is likely to declare it illegal, while the EU, the US, the UK, Germany and France all expressed support for Spanish unity. Before Madrid took over the Catalan government, the region had one of the greatest levels of self-government in Spain. It has its own parliament, police force and public broadcaster, as well as a government and president, though those have now been dismissed. Catalans hada range of powers,externalin many policy areas from culture and environment to communications, transportation, commerce and public safety. Foreign affairs, the armed forces and fiscal policy were always the sole responsibility of the Spanish government. What powers has Catalonia now lost? The case for and against independence Thousands celebrated the declaration of independence on the streets of Barcelona, Catalonia's regional capital. The same crowds that cheered each Yes vote from Catalan MPs reportedly booed Mr Rajoy as he made his announcement. There were pro-unity demonstrations too, with protesters in Barcelona waving Spanish flags and denouncing Catalan independence. A large pro-unity rally is expected in Madrid on Saturday. In other reaction: Barcelona's mayor Ada Colau condemned the move by Madrid,but also criticised Catalan pro-independence parties,externalfor ""advancing at a kamikaze pace...after their mistaken reading of the results of the Catalan elections"" EU President Donald Tusk said Madrid's government ""remains our only interlocutor"" in Spain, but called for restraint The UK government said it did not recognise the declaration of independence by Catalonia. After the 1 October referendum, Mr Puigdemont signed a declaration of independence but delayed implementation to allow talks with the Spanish government. He ignored warnings by the Madrid government to cancel the move, prompting Mr Rajoy to first announce his plans to remove Catalan leaders and impose direct rule. Does Catalonia want to leave Spain? Reality Check: Police violence in Catalonia Catalonia is one of Spain's richest, most distinctive regions, with a high degree of autonomy. Many Catalans feel they pay more to Madrid than they get back, and there are historical grievances, too, in particular Catalonia's treatment under the dictatorship of General Franco. But Catalans have been divided on the question of independence.

'First charges filed' in US Russia probe,"Mr Mueller is leading the investigation into alleged Russian interference in the election The first charges have been filed in the investigation led by special counsel Robert Mueller into alleged Russia interference in the 2016 US election, media reports say. It was not clear what the charges were and who they targeted, CNN and Reuters reported quoting unnamed sources. Anyone charged could be taken into custody as soon as Monday, CNN said. US intelligence agencies said earlier this year the Russian government sought to help Donald Trump win the election. The document said thatRussia led a campaign to ""denigrate"" his Democrat opponent Hillary Clintonby hacking into email accounts and paying social media ""trolls"" to make nasty comments. Russia: The 'cloud' over the Trump White House How did we get here? Mr Mueller's investigation is looking into any links between Russia and the Trump campaign. Both deny there was any collusion. The charges, approved by a federal grand jury in Washington, are sealed under orders from a federal judge, the reports added. A spokesman for Mr Mueller has declined to comment on the reports. His team is known to have conducted extensive interviews with several current and former White House officials. Robert Mueller, a former FBI director, was appointed by the Justice Department as special counsel in May shortly after Mr Trump fired FBI director James Comey. What is the special counsel? Mr Trump has denied there was any collusion with Russia Mr Trump said on Twitter on Friday,externalthat it was now ""commonly agreed"" that there was no collusion between him and Russia, but said that there were links between Moscow and Mrs Clinton. Republican lawmakers have said that a uranium deal with a Russian company in 2010, when Mrs Clinton was secretary of state, was sealed in exchange for donations to her husband's charity. An investigation has been opened into the case. Democrats say it is an attempt to divert attention from the alleged ties between Russia and Mr Trump.

Nuclear sub sailors fired after drugs tests,"HMS Vigilant is one of Britain's four Vanguard-class submarines Nine sailors from a nuclear missile submarine have been dismissed from the Royal Navy after failing drugs tests, the Ministry of Defence has said. They had been serving aboard HMS Vigilant, which carries the Trident nuclear deterrent. The Daily Mail reported thatthe drug they had taken was cocaine,external. Defence Secretary Michael Fallon is understood to have ordered all UK submarine crews to be tested for drugs. He is said to have given First Sea Lord Admiral Sir Philip Jones a ""roasting"" over the incident. The Royal Navy said it did not tolerate drugs misuse, adding: ""Those found to have fallen short of our high standards face being discharged from service."" Michael Fallon, pictured on a visit to HMS Vigilant in Faslane in 2016, is said to have ordered drugs tests of all UK submarine crews Earlier this month, thesubmarine's captain was relieved of his commandafter an alleged ""inappropriate relationship"" with a member of his crew. The Royal Navy said at the time that an investigation was ongoing and operations were not impacted. The BBC's Jonathan Beale said Vigilant's second-in-command had also been removed over similar allegations. HMS Vigilant is one of Britain's four Vanguard-class submarines which carry up to eight Trident missiles armed with nuclear warheads. The submarine is based at Her Majesty's Naval Base Clyde at Faslane in Argyll and Bute. All Royal Navy vessels have a ""no touching rule"" that prohibits intimate relationships on board.

Residents warned bad smell 'could return',"A smell like ""burnt plastic"" filled the air A noxious odour which hit parts of a coastal town on Friday night could return, residents have been warned. Residents in Seaford, East Sussex, were told to stay indoors and keep windows closed after complaining of stinging eyes and feeling sick. East Sussex Fire and Rescue Service could not find the cause of the smell, but warned pockets of the odour could return as the weather warms up later. Sussex Police said the stench resembled ""burning plastic"". The smell was first noticed in The Ridings area of the town at about 18:00 BST and did not fade away until about 23:00.

Spain asserts direct rule over Catalans,"Spain's Deputy PM Soraya Saenz de Santamaria is now officially in charge of Catalonia The Spanish government has stripped Catalonia of its autonomy and taken charge of its government. The measures came early on Saturday after the Catalan parliament voted to declare independence on Friday. An official state bulletin dismissed Catalan leaders and handed control of Catalonia to Spain's Deputy Prime Minister, Soraya Saenz de Santamaria. Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont has called for ""democratic opposition"" to the takeover. He made the call in a TV address broadcast from an undisclosed location. Earlier, Spain's interior ministry took charge of Catalonia's police after firing senior Catalan police officials. On Friday, PM Mariano Rajoy announced the dissolution of the regional parliament and the removal of the Catalan leader, and called snap local elections. Demonstrations for and against independence went on into the night. A large rally ""for the unity of Spain and the constitution"" is being held in Madrid. Barca coach ducks Catalan questions Catalonia crisis: What next for Spain? EU risks ""more cracks"" appearing The crisis began when Catalan leaders held an independence referendum, defying a ruling by the Constitutional Court which had declared it illegal. The Catalan government said that of the 43% of potential voters who took part, 90% were in favour of independence. Others boycotted the vote after the court ruling. This video can not be played At times there were tensions between opposing sets of demonstrators. On Friday afternoon, the Catalan regional parliament voted to declare independence from Spain. Soon after, the Spanish Senate granted Mr Rajoy's government the power to impose direct rule on Catalonia. It did so early on Saturday by publishingan official bulletin,external(in Spanish) that dismissed Mr Puigdemont and all government members. The announcement came hours after the Madrid government removed Josep LluÃ­s Trapero Ãlvarez as chief of Catalonia's autonomous Mossos police force. Mr Trapero was already under investigation for sedition, accused of failing to help Spain's Guardia Civil police tackle thousands of pro-independence protesters in Barcelona during the run-up to the referendum. He was replaced by Ferran LÃ³pez, his deputy. Pere Soler i Campins, director general of the Mossos, was also dismissed. Large crowds turned out in Madrid on Saturday to support Spanish unity The BBC's Sarah Rainsford, in Madrid, said that implementing the changes is likely to be a complex process for Spanish authorities - and one bound to be met with stiff resistance from those who just voted for independence. Regional elections are scheduled for 21 December. Mr Puigdemont has urged supporters to ""maintain the momentum"" in a peaceful manner, but Spanish prosecutors say they will file charges of ""rebellion"" against him next week. This video can not be played The moment Catalan parliament declared independence Separatists say the independence move means they no longer fall under Spanish jurisdiction. But the Spanish Constitutional Court is likely to declare it illegal, while the EU, the US, the UK, Germany and France all expressed support for Spanish unity. Before Madrid took over the Catalan government, the region had one of the greatest levels of self-government in Spain. It has its own parliament, police force and public broadcaster, as well as a government and president, though those have now been dismissed. Catalans hada range of powers,externalin many policy areas from culture and environment to communications, transportation, commerce and public safety. Foreign affairs, the armed forces and fiscal policy were always the sole responsibility of the Spanish government. What powers has Catalonia now lost? The case for and against independence Thousands celebrated the declaration of independence on the streets of Barcelona, Catalonia's regional capital. The same crowds that cheered each Yes vote from Catalan MPs reportedly booed Mr Rajoy as he made his announcement. There were pro-unity demonstrations too, with protesters in Barcelona waving Spanish flags and denouncing Catalan independence. A large pro-unity rally is expected in Madrid on Saturday. In other reaction: Barcelona's mayor Ada Colau condemned the move by Madrid,but also criticised Catalan pro-independence parties,externalfor ""advancing at a kamikaze pace...after their mistaken reading of the results of the Catalan elections"" EU President Donald Tusk said Madrid's government ""remains our only interlocutor"" in Spain, but called for restraint The UK government said it did not recognise the declaration of independence by Catalonia. After the 1 October referendum, Mr Puigdemont signed a declaration of independence but delayed implementation to allow talks with the Spanish government. He ignored warnings by the Madrid government to cancel the move, prompting Mr Rajoy to first announce his plans to remove Catalan leaders and impose direct rule. Does Catalonia want to leave Spain? Reality Check: Police violence in Catalonia Catalonia is one of Spain's richest, most distinctive regions, with a high degree of autonomy. Many Catalans feel they pay more to Madrid than they get back, and there are historical grievances, too, in particular Catalonia's treatment under the dictatorship of General Franco. But Catalans have been divided on the question of independence.

Nine sailors dismissed after drugs tests,"HMS Vigilant is one of Britain's four Vanguard-class submarines Nine sailors from a nuclear missile submarine have been dismissed from the Royal Navy after failing drugs tests, the Ministry of Defence has said. They had been serving aboard HMS Vigilant, which carries the Trident nuclear deterrent. The Daily Mail reported thatthe drug they had taken was cocaine,external. Defence Secretary Michael Fallon is understood to have ordered all UK submarine crews to be tested for drugs. He is said to have given First Sea Lord Admiral Sir Philip Jones a ""roasting"" over the incident. The Royal Navy said it did not tolerate drugs misuse, adding: ""Those found to have fallen short of our high standards face being discharged from service."" Michael Fallon, pictured on a visit to HMS Vigilant in Faslane in 2016, is said to have ordered drugs tests of all UK submarine crews Earlier this month, thesubmarine's captain was relieved of his commandafter an alleged ""inappropriate relationship"" with a member of his crew. The Royal Navy said at the time that an investigation was ongoing and operations were not impacted. The BBC's Jonathan Beale said Vigilant's second-in-command had also been removed over similar allegations. HMS Vigilant is one of Britain's four Vanguard-class submarines which carry up to eight Trident missiles armed with nuclear warheads. The submarine is based at Her Majesty's Naval Base Clyde at Faslane in Argyll and Bute. All Royal Navy vessels have a ""no touching rule"" that prohibits intimate relationships on board.

Marriage may protect against dementia,"Marriage and having close friends may help protect against dementia, according to Loughborough University researchers. The study,published in Journals of Gerontology,external, followed 6,677 adults for just under seven years. The quality of a person's social circle appeared more important than the overall size, the research team said. The Alzheimer's Society said it was essential to help patients to maintain ""meaningful social connections"". None of the participants had dementia at the start of the trial, but 220 were diagnosed during it. The research group compared the traits of those who did and did not develop dementia to find clues as to how social lives affect risk. One finding was that when it comes to friends, it's quality, not quantity, that counts. Prof Eef Hogervorst said: ""You can be surrounded by people, but it is the number of close relationships that is associated with a reduced risk for dementia... it's not about the quantity."" She thinks having close friends acts as a ""buffer"" against stress, which is linked to poor health. Nine factors that contribute to dementia risk Mid-life hearing loss - responsible for 9% of the risk Failing to complete secondary education - 8% Smoking - 5% Failing to seek early treatment for depression - 4% Physical inactivity - 3% Social isolation - 2% High blood pressure - 2% Obesity - 1% Type 2 diabetes - 1% These risk factors - which are described as potentially modifiable - add up to 35%. The other 65% of dementia risk is thought to be potentially non-modifiable. The study also suggested that single people had twice the risk of developing dementia during the study than those who were married. Dr Doug Brown, director of research at the Alzheimer's Society, said: ""This amounts to about one extra diagnosis in each 100 unmarried people."" As the study only follows people over time it cannot prove cause and effect. Dementia is known to start in the brain decades before it is diagnosed and some of these early changes may affect people's ability to socialise. Either way, Dr Brown said loneliness was a real issue in dementia. He said: ""If people are not properly supported, dementia can be an incredibly isolating experience. ""It is essential people with dementia are supported to maintain meaningful social connections and continue living their life as they want.""
