Village flooded for second time after tree felling,"This video can not be played 'I feel really upset': Pentre homes flooded twice in day A blockage believed to have caused flooding in a village was the result of woodland cut down by Natural Resources Wales, the body has said. Pentre in Rhondda Cynon Taff flooded a second time in five days after the culvert collapsed under felled trees. Rhondda MP Chris Bryant said the damage in the village could cost up to Â£5m. Meanwhile firefighters rescued a woman who was clinging to a branch in a fast-flowing river, while another was saved from the roof of a submerged car. Thursday's yellow warning for rain covered 19 of Wales' 22 local authority areas, with some areas in the north expected to see up to 100mm (4in) of rain. NRW admitted felled trees blocked a culvert, causing the flooding in Pentre NRW said engineers had been checking flood defences and carrying out urgent repairs and clearing blockages. However Mr Bryant said the government-sponsored body had ""questions to answer"" for not keeping culverts clear and should set up a multi-million pound compensation fund. His comments followed flooding in Pleasant Street, Pentre, following the collapsed culvert. Residents called the situation ""horrific"" and said houses had suffered severe damage. NRW confirmed 95% of the Pentre woodland had been felled in a bid to tackle Larch disease. Bill Purvis, NRW duty tactical manger, said: ""From the photographs and pictures available it is evident that wooded material entered the watercourse and ended up blocking the grid. ""A review will be undertaken of our operations so that we learn lessons and can make improvements to ensure this doesn't happen again."" Three homes in Pentre, Rhondda were hit by flooding Forecasters had predicted a month's rain could fall in north Wales over 24 hours and the fire service warned people not to drive through floodwater. Twenty firefighters from Mid and West Wales fire service rescued a woman clinging to a branch near Brecon promenade, Powys, at 03:00 GMT on Thursday. The Welsh Ambulance Service said she was taken to hospital. A second woman was also rescued from the roof of a submerged car on the Wales/England border near Chepstow on Tuesday, fire chiefs confirmed. Mark Smith, 51, told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire show how hewaded into Â­floodwateron the banks of the River Wye to rescue the woman who had been trapped for 12 hours near St Briavels in the Forest of Dean. Mark Smith waded into the water after being alerted by Geoff Handley Some Rhondda Cynon Taf council staff were moved out of their offices at Clydach Vale amid concerns of a potential landslide nearby, but have since returned. The authority said it was also drawing up plans to rebuild a damaged wall on the River Rhondda at Blaencwm. Why Wales is prone to landslides In pictures: Storm Dennis brings flooding to Wales Leader Andrew Morgan said up to 1,000 properties had been affected by flooding and 20 families were being housed in temporary accommodation. ""On top of that we had massive damage to infrastructure. At least three possibly four bridges will need to be completely replaced,"" he added. In Bridgend, council engineers were checking 41 former coal mining sites in the Ogmore, Garw and Llynfi valleys to ensure they are safe. The Coal Authority confirmed it was also checking sites they might have responsibility for. Donations at Trallwn Community Centre in Pontypridd for flood victims Residents in Ynysybwl have complained that sandbags delivered on Thursday were too little, too late. Paul Thomas lives on Clydach Terrace where 19 houses were flooded on Saturday night by water that was ""over head height"". ""Outlying areas like ours don't get the money or support and we've only now been given sandbags,"" he said. ""However the level of water exceeded the four sandbags we got by about five feet, so they would have been a total waste of time anyway."" Paul Thomas shows how high the water level rose in house in Ynysybwl Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn visited Rhydyfelin in Pontypridd on Thursday and criticised the UK government's response as ""wholly inadequate"". Mr Corbyn said Boris Johnson was showing his ""true colours"", adding: ""If the prime minister is not campaigning for votes in a general election he simply does not care about helping communities affected by flooding."" Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price also questioned why Mr Johnson had not convened Cobra, the UK government's emergency response committee. In response, a UK government spokesman said flood defences and the response to flooding were devolved to the Welsh Government. ""The UK government has communicated with emergency services, local authorities and the Welsh Government - including the first minister - throughout the past week and we are ready to provide assistance, where possible, should additional help be required,"" he said. Jeremy Corbyn visited Rhydyfelin on Thursday AWelsh Government summit was held on Wednesdaywith councils and other agencies to look at the problems caused by flooding. First Minister Mark Drakeford toldBBC Breakfast: ""This is a genuine emergency and we are working to mobilise every bit of help we can for families."" Meanwhile, the Plaid Cymru leader of Carmarthenshire council has accused the Welsh Government of ""favouritism"" when it comes to dealing with the aftermath of flooding. Emlyn Dole toldNewyddion 9the Labour-led Welsh Government had ""reacted in the areas that they are strongest"". He added: ""So far there has been no reaction to what happened with Storm Callum 18 months ago, whilst there has been a reaction straightaway to what has happened this time. ""Our people had the same serious situation last time - but there wasn't a penny to help."" A Welsh Government spokesman said the impact and severity of storms Ciara and Dennis had been unprecedented, adding: ""We will always ensure we do everything we can to support everyone affected."" The River Dee, at Llangollen, Denbighshire, was raging Prince Charles, the Prince of Wales, is due to visit Pontypridd on Friday to speak to home owners forced to leave their properties and the rescuers who saved many from rising waters. And Hollywood actor Michael Sheen, from Port Talbot, haslaunched a crowdfunding campaignto help flooded communities. ""The devastation that Storm Dennis has left behind is very real and thousands of people across the UK have lost everything,"" he said. The Welsh Rugby Union has also set up afund to help rugby clubs affected by the weather. The water treatment works in Monmouth were left inaccessible after river levels rose to record highs Water bottle stations were set up in Monmouth after fears hundreds of homes could be left without supply after Welsh Water's treatment site was flooded. Managing director Peter Perry said it could take up to 48 hours to get the Mayhill plant up and running. How dangerous is floodwater? What should I do if I'm hit by flooding? South Wales Fire and Rescue Service have warned of the potential dangers of carbon monoxide poisoning from using gas-powered power generators during the clean-up. Network Rail has reopened the Treherbert line, Heart of Wales line and the Cambrian lines, however the following lines remain closed: Ebbw Vale Line (north of Cross Keys) Abergavenny to Hereford Valleys Aberdare line Conwy Valley line Cars abandoned due to the flooding of the River Wye in Monmouth are being recovered BBC reporter Nicky Smith reports from Treforest I have spent time at Treforest Industrial Estate and what I witnessed was dirt, damage and despair. In the businesses I spoke to, they are only just beginning to understand the financial cost of Storm Dennis and, in each one I stopped at, they talked of it running to thousands of pounds. Harry Singh, owner of the Welsh Shop, said his stock had been ruined in the middle of the Six Nations But in all the mess, there is one very clear message. They will do everything in their power to stay open for business. Harry Singh, who owns the Welsh Shop which stores its stock here, showed me piles of merchandise ruined by the flood water - he believes he has lost up to Â£400,000 worth of stock. The impact is even worse as this is one of their busiest times, in the middle of the Six Nations rugby championship, and he has not been able to fulfil online orders. Paul Cooper's home was damaged when a roof was swept into his garden from about 400m away A couple whose home was damaged and a roof was swept into their garden during the floods, told me they would not be able to return home for up to 18 months. Paul Cooper said they felt a bit lost following the news and, like many others, hoped for good news soon. BBC reporter Matt Murray in Pontypridd and Nantgarw Lynn Davies said the damage was ""absolutely soul destroying"" Roads are now crowded with skips, tractors and trailers clearing debris, rubbish, and cars that have been written off. There's a realisation by those affected just how life-changing this will be for them. Self-employed builder Lynn Davies had just finished refurbishing his home when it was flooded and all his tools and van, which he needs to work, were also ruined. He is now living in a hotel with his family and dogs and says it may be five months before they can return home. There's also anger here as people feel they were alerted too late to the risk of the flood waters hitting their homes. BBC reporter Rhys Williams in Ystradgynlais Engineers are surveying the damage on the Teddy Bear Bridge in Ystradgynlais, Powys, after part of the bridge collapsed on Tuesday The Teddy Bear Bridge - so-called because miners teetering across the previous rickety bridge to get to work looked like teddy bears - is one of the victims of the heavy rain in Ystradgynlais. The more modern bridge is still standing, but there's a huge crack in the wall and the structure has buckled considerably. The storm has also caused flooding for residents in Ystalyfera, where the community is banding together and reminding people of the ""good old days"" when everyone pitched in together to help out. On Wednesday residents were in their third day of clearing out the downstairs of their homes into bags to be collected by the council. Lenny Jenkins has spent the day clearing out his home, ruined by the water. Like the rest of his street, he says has no insurance as no company will ""go near us."" Most of his neighbours have been re-housed by the council. He's worried the community in the area is going to suffer as people leave the street.

Met refers itself to watchdog over Flack contact,"The Metropolitan Police has referred itself to the police watchdog following the death of TV star Caroline Flack. Scotland Yard's directorate of professional standards (DPS) reviewed all previous contact with Ms Flack, 40, before it made Wednesday's referral. It was standard practice for a referral to be made when a person who had recent contact with police died, the Met said. Ms Flack was found dead at her London flat on Saturday as she awaited trial for allegedly assaulting her boyfriend. Aninquest into the former Love Island host's deathwas opened and adjourned on Wednesday. A statement from the Met said: ""No notice of investigation has been served on any officer and no conduct issues have been identified by the DPS. No officer is on restricted duties or suspended."" An Independent Office for Police Conduct spokesman said: ""We will make a decision on the level of our involvement after carefully assessing the information we have received. ""Receipt of a referral does not mean an investigation will necessarily follow."" Flowers were left outside Caroline Flack's former house Ms Flack left her role presenting the ITV2 dating show after being charged with assaulting her partner Lewis Burton in December and was due to stand trial next month. In anunpublished Instagram post shared by her family, she said her ""whole world and future was swept from under my feet"" following her arrest. Ms Flack pleaded not guilty to assault by beating at a court appearance in December, when it was heard her partner did not support the prosecution. She was released on bail but was ordered to stop any contact with Mr Burton ahead of the trial. Love Island did not air on Saturday or Sunday but returned on Monday with a tribute to the former X Factor presenter and Strictly Come Dancing winner, who started hosting the programme in 2015.

Barclays scraps 'Big Brother' staff tracking system,"Barclays says it has scrapped a system that tracked the time employees spent at their desks and sent warnings to those spending too long on breaks. The bank introduced the computer monitoring system last week, but faced a staff backlash,reported,externalby City AM. Barclays said axing the tracking system was a response to ""colleague feedback"", but would not say if it was permanent. The software, Sapience, claims to create ""unprecedented transparency"" within companies. ""It also determines when an employee goes offline for periods of time,"" the software firm's website says. A Barclays source said the tool was used to monitor the ""effectiveness"" of people's time at their desks. But in addition to sparking unease within the bank, it attracted criticism from privacy campaigners and HR professionals. Silkie Carlo, director of privacy campaign group Big Brother Watch, said ""intrusive monitoring"" deprived staff of privacy in the workplace. ""Managers would never get away with breathing down employee's necks, personally monitoring their screens or logging toilet and water breaks,"" she said. ""The availability of technology to [monitor] staff surreptitiously does not make it any more acceptable."" She described the software as ""creepy"" and called on Barclays to ""urgently review"" its use. Is my boss allowed to spy on me? How does it feel to be watched at work all the time? 'It felt like we were in prisonâ Barclays said the software was part of a pilot that was rolled out in part of its investment banking division. But after the City AM newspaper revealed details of the scheme and published damning comments from an employee who spoke to the paper anonymously, Barclays said managers would no longer be able to track the activities of individual workers. In a statement, the bank said: ""We always intended to listen to colleague feedback as part of this limited pilot which was intended to tackle issues such as individual over-working as well as raise general productivity."" But Edward Houghton, head of research at Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, questioned whether it was ever appropriate to use what he described as a ""Big Brother"" approach to workplace monitoring. ""Technologies like this may actually cause more harm than good,"" he said. ""They can... create mistrust or low levels of trust for employees - employees can feel like they're being watched and not trusted to do their own work effectively."" It is not the first time the bank has come under fire for using technology to monitor its staff. In 2017, Barclays faced widespread criticism after it installed black boxes under the bankers' desks to track how long they were spending at work. Campaign group Privacy International said: ""Data protection rules are very clear, strict and do not allow employers to carry out such monitoring unless they are able to prove that this is strictly necessary and proportionate and it does not severely impact employees' rights. ""People are entitled to some fundamental rights even if they are in work,"" it said. ""International banks are no exception."" How does it feel to be watched at work all the time?

National Trust to end Cadbury egg hunt next year,"The National Trust has said this year's Easter egg hunts will be the last with Cadbury as it seeks to focus on ""nature and the outdoors"". Annual egg hunts have taken place for 13 years, but the trust said it wanted to make chocolate ""less of a focus"". Health campaigners said they ""applaud"" the trust for ending the ""unhealthy association"" with sugary food. Cadbury said they had come to a mutual decision to end the ""wonderful"" partnership. The move will affect hundreds of trails through the grounds of National Trust properties across England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland from 2021. PM steps in over Cadbury Easter egg row Easter promotion breached junk food rules Cadbury pulls 'stupid' treasure hunt ad The trust said: ""Now is the time for change as we look to increase our emphasis on nature and the outdoors. ""To reflect that in our Easter activities, from next year we will be making chocolate less of a focus."" Cadbury said ""the time is right for both sides to move on"". But the company said it would continue to ""look for ways to bring Easter trails to more families across the UK"". Barbara Crowther at the Children's Food Campaign said she was ""really pleased"" that the National Trust was moving its Easter activities away from chocolate. ""We can imagine so many healthy, fun and active ways for children to explore National Trust properties at Easter that don't involve lots of sugary treats,"" she said. ""Children are growing up in a marketing environment that constantly nudges them towards snacks and treats, so we applaud the National Trust in recognising it is the right time to end the unhealthy association with chocolate."" The Easter egg hunts have proved controversial in the past, with former Prime Minister Theresa May and the Archbishop of York intervening in 2017 to criticise the apparent absence of the word ""Easter"" from the event marketing. Both Cadbury and the National Trust said Easter was explicitly mentioned dozens of times. And in 2018, the chocolate manufacturer's partnership with the National Trust for Scotland was deemed to have broken advertising rules over marketing junk food to children.

Boy given life for 'internal decapitation' murder,"The teenager murdered Frank Sinclair near Westwood Community Centre in East Kilbride A schoolboy who ""internally decapitated"" a 61-year-old man after repeatedly stamping on his head has been given a life sentence for murder. The 17-year-old killed Frank Sinclair in East Kilbride, South Lanarkshire, last year. The youth, who cannot be named because of his age, attacked Mr Sinclair as he believed he had earlier pushed him outside a community hall. A jury found himguilty of murderat the High Court in Glasgow last month. Lord Burns told the teenager he would have to serve at least 11 years in custody before he could be considered for release. Sentencing the boy at the High Court in Edinburgh, he said the attack was ""wholly unprovoked"". Lord Burns added: ""You proceeded to stamp on a vulnerable and immobile 61-year-old man who you had encountered lying on the ground. ""By this terrible act you killed him and deprived his family and friends of his love and companionship and they will have to live with that for the rest of their lives and you have to live with that for the rest of your life."" The court heard the teenager and three female friends came across Mr Sinclair lying on the ground behind Westwood Community Centre at about 20:00 on 19 January last year. Initially the boy tried to help the victim up but became angry when they both lost their balance and fell to the ground. The court heard he believed Mr Sinclair had pushed him, causing him to scrape his face off the community centre wall. One of the girls phoned for an ambulance and the boy walked away. The court then heard he returned about 15 minutes later. The girl said: ""He ran up to Mr Sinclair, raised his foot and put it down on his face. ""I could hear the sound of his foot hitting the head - the stamps were hard and forceful."" Mr Sinclair suffered 19 injuries to his face and neck including a fractured Adam's apple and a vertebrae at the top of his spine was severed causing internal decapitation. Pathologist Sharon Calvert told the court this was caused by having his head repeatedly stamped on. The jury heard such an injury was usually only seen in people who had fallen from a height or been involved in a road traffic accident. The teenager gave evidence during proceedings and admitted to prosecution lawyer Liam Ewing QC that he had attacked Mr Sinclair. Asked what his intention was as his victim lay on the ground, the teenager replied: ""To hurt him. ""I just lost my temper. I just lost it. I thought he'd be knocked out. ""I didn't know what I did to him would kill him."" He also told the jury: ""I've still not got over it. I just feel destroyed."" Defence advocate Bert Kerrigan QC told Lord Burns that his client came from a stable background and a loving family. But the court heard the accused had anger management issues and had a ""propensity to resort to violence."" The boy was also sentenced to two years for an unprovoked attack on 18-year-old Jay Mungall. The court heard he punched the teenager on the head and body at Westwood Stores in East Kilbride, about an hour before the murder. This sentence will be served concurrently with the 11-year punishment part of the life sentence.

Police probe whether racist German killer had help,"This video can not be played Muhammed spoke from hospital about how he survived the shooting The investigation into a deadly gun attack in Hanau is focusing on whether others knew about or helped organise it, Germany's federal prosecutor says. The suspect shot dead nine people ""of migrant background"" at two shisha bars on Wednesday evening. He and his mother were later found dead in his flat. Peter Frank said material the suspect Tobias R had posted online showed a ""deeply racist mindset"". He had also been influenced by conspiracy theories, Mr Frank said. Earlier Chancellor Angela Merkel said there were many signs Tobias R, 43, had acted out of racism. Has Germany done enough to tackle far-right violence? German Kurds react - 'a shock but not a surprise' What we know so far Speaking in Berlin, Mrs Merkel said: ""Racism is a poison. Hate is a poison and this poison exists in our society and is already to blame for many crimes."" Thousands of people have attended vigils in Hanau and cities across Germany. This video can not be played People came together in Hanau and Berlin to remember the victims Turkey says at least five of the dead were Turkish citizens. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said he expected Germany to ""throw light on all aspects"" of the attack. Nazi salutes, banned swastika emblems and even the playing of the Horst Wessel, the one-time Nazi ""anthem"" - all have been cropping up in far-right extremist circles as Germany struggles to contain a growing wave of home-grown extremism. The problem has been particularly acute in - but not confined to - the east of the country, in the former East Germany. There, unemployment levels have been higher than in the rest of Germany and a simmering resentment, by some, of the recent immigrant arrivals has manifested itself in arson attacks on hostels. In 2015 Germany opened its borders to an estimated 1.5 million refugees from the Middle East. Although the number of subsequent incidents involving them has been very small, their arrival has been used by far right extremists to stoke ethnic tensions and recruit more young men and women to their cause. Mr Frank said six people had also been injured in the attack, one of them seriously. Shortly after the attacks the suspect and his 72-year-old mother were found in his apartment, both also shot. A gun was found next to the suspect's body. This video can not be played Eyewitnesses filmed the aftermath of the shooting Mr Frank said investigators wanted to establish any links the suspect may have had in Germany or potentially also abroad. ""My sympathies to the loved ones of the victims. I wish the injured a swift recovery. It is a day that will live long in our memory and will motivate our investigations,"" Mr Frank said at a short news conference. The shootings took place around 22:00 (21:00 GMT) on Wednesday, and the first target was the Midnight shisha bar in the city centre of Hanau. Witnesses reported hearing about a dozen gunshots. The suspect then travelled by car to the Kesselstadt neighbourhood, some 2.5km (1.5 miles) away, and opened fire at the Arena Bar & Cafe. Shisha bars are places where people gather to smoke a pipe known as shisha or hookah. Traditionally found in Middle Eastern and Asian countries, they are also popular in many other parts of the world. Hanau residents demonstrated against racism The shootings sparked a manhunt. Police identified the gunman through information from witnesses and surveillance cameras. Early on Thursday, they stormed the suspect's home, near the scene of the second shooting. Hanau, in Hesse state, is a city of 100,000 residents about 25km east of Frankfurt. They included German citizens and foreigners aged between 21 and 44, Germany's federal prosecutor said. Among the dead were ""several victims of Kurdish origin"", the Kon-Med association of Kurds in Germany said, adding that it was ""furious"" the authorities were not doing more to fight extremism. A Bosnian and a Bulgarian also died in the attack, those countries' foreign ministries said. Ali Can, a German-Turkish anti-racism activist, posted a photo of a friend of his cousin, saying that the friend was among those killed. Writing on Twitter he said: ""We can't spend a peaceful evening out, we're scared for our lives. What is happening in Germany? Where is the protection?"" Allow Twitter content?

Tobias R had posted videos and a kind of manifesto on his website, Mr Frank said. In the manifesto he wrote that people from more than 20 countries including Turkey and Israel should be ""destroyed"", AFP reported. London-based German counter-terrorism expert Peter Neumann said the text contained ""various, but mostly extreme right views, with a do-it-yourself ideology cobbled together out of parts found on the internet"". The suspect has been identified as Tobias R ""The pattern is clear, and not at all new,"" he added. In her statement, Mrs Merkel said there were ""many indications at the moment that the perpetrator acted on right-wing extremist, racist motives, out of hatred towards people of other origins, religion or appearance"". Hesse state Interior Minister Peter Beuth said the suspect had not previously been known to the authorities. The Bild tabloid reports he had a firearms licence, and that ammunition and gun magazines were found in his car. Claus Schmidt, who runs the Diana Bergen-Enkheim shooting club that Tobias R joined, described him as ""totally inconspicuous"". ""There was not a hint of racism or hatred towards foreigners, not even an awkward joke. He was always friendly,"" he told Reuters. Gun laws in Germany are among the most stringent in the world, and were tightened further in recent years after other mass shootings.

Bavarian authorities later classify the attack as ""politically motivated"", saying the teen had ""radical right-wing and racist views"" Hanau Mayor Claus Kaminsky said it had been the ""hardest day in our history"". He said the city had seen centuries of peaceful coexistence between different faiths and cultures - ""That is why it is so hard to understand"". Hesse state leader Volker Bouffier said the state parliament had travelled to Hanau to show its solidarity with the victims and their families. He said the attack ""came out of a climate"" that existed ""to some degree worldwide"" in which people are targeted because they are different. ""We will do everything to show that people don't have to be afraid and show them that they belong with us, "" he said. A minute's silence was held at the opening of the Berlin International Film Festival However the co-leader of the far right AfD party said the attack was ""neither right- nor left-wing terrorism"" but the actions of ""a madman"". Politicians from the rest of political spectrum accused the expressly anti-Islam and anti-immigration AfD of stirring up anti-foreigner hatred. In other reaction: German Defence Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer: ""The background must now be clarified further. Violence from right-wing extremists must not let us rest, we must stand against it"" Ursula von der Leyen, European Commission President and former German government minister: ""I am deeply shocked by the tragedy that took place... in Hanau"" French President Emmanuel Macron: ""Immense sadness and my full support for Germany in the face of this tragic attack... I stand with Chancellor Merkel in this fight for our values and the protection of our democracies"" Germany's Muslim association KRM called for more to be done in the fight against right-wing extremism, saying they had requested for months that needed to be ""a clear stand against Islamophobia"" Were you in the area?

No let-up as Dennis flood warnings continue,"Flood water continues to surround areas such as Upton upon Severn in Worcestershire Flood warnings remain in place across the UK after parts of north-west England experienced more than a month's worth of rain in the last 24 hours. Two areas in Cumbria, Seathwaite and Honister Pass, recorded more rain than the county's February average of 112mm. Nearly 100 flood warnings remain across the UK - six of them in England severe, meaning there is a danger to life. Thesevere warnings,externalare across the Midlands near the Welsh border around the Rivers Lugg, Severn and Wye. Flooding 'is going to get worse' Four ways to stop flooding In pictures: Flooding from Storm Dennis Just how wet has this winter been? Hundreds of people have been evacuated from their homes due to floods, with the worst-affected areas including south Wales, Herefordshire, Worcestershire and Shropshire. In Gloucestershire,more than 300 people staying on a travellers' site have been strandedby flood water. Also in the county, a man has told of how hewaded into floodwater to rescue a woman who had been trapped on the roof of her submerged car for 12 hours. Mark Smith, 51, told theVictoria Derbyshire programme: ""I could hear someone shouting for help. She was half in the car and half in the water."" In Wales, a blockage believed to have caused flooding in a village was found to have been caused bywoodland cut down by Natural Resources Wales, a government-sponsored body. Earlier,firefighters in Brecon rescued a woman who was clinging to a branchin a fast-flowing river.

He said volunteers turned up at 06:00 GMT on Sunday to help sweep out the mud - only to see it flooded once again on Monday. ""I don't know what we will do until it dries, which could take weeks. I've got no money coming in and a mortgage to pay but I'm also worried about my staff,"" he told the BBC. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has faced criticism from opposition parties for not visiting flood-hit communities. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he was showing his ""true colours by his absence"", adding that the prime minister was sending a ""clear message"" by not convening the government's emergency committee, Cobra. Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price also questioned why Mr Johnson had not convened Cobra. Fire Brigades Union general secretary Matt Wrack said his union had been raising the issue of long-term planning to deal with extreme weather events for years, but had found the government's response to be ""lacklustre"". On Wednesday, business minister Nadhim Zahawi told Sky News the prime minister was focused on getting ""money out the door"" to businesses and local authorities in affected communities. ""He wants to help people by getting funding to them,"" Mr Zahawi said. Environment Secretary George Eustice said the government was investing Â£2.6bn in flood defences. Latest on floods in the West Midlands Wales: Flood-hit areas braced for more rain How dangerous is floodwater? There was heavy rain across northern and western parts of Britain overnight and during Thursday. In Cumbria, in Honister Pass, 178mm of rain fell in 24 hours, while in Seathwaite 158mm of rain was recorded.

Delayed road-widening scheme Â£100m over budget,"The project is aimed at improving safety on the A465 and regenerating the region's economy Wales' biggest road building project is costing taxpayers about Â£100m more than planned, a new report has said. Transforming the A465 into a dual carriageway between Gilwern and Brynmawr was meant to be finished by September 2018 but is now pegged for completion in April 2021. Auditor general Adrian Crompton said those living locally were paying a ""higher than expected price"". The Welsh Government said the scheme was complex, but would bring benefits. The five mile-long project in the Clydach Gorge has been hit by legal disputes between the Welsh Government and road builder Costain. The geology of the area has been at the centre of the challenges and what has been found on site has been more difficult to build on than anticipated. Both sides have argued over who should pay for the increase in cost. The Wales Audit Office (WAO) report into the delays said it was impossible to say how long the dispute would take to resolve and the uncertainty meant it was difficult for the Welsh Government to predict the final figure. Major road project could face more delays over row Dispute over Â£51m road overspend More delays to Heads of the Valleys road upgrade It is part of a larger project to widen the A465 and was first envisaged in 1994. In 2014, costs to the public purse were estimated by the Welsh Government at Â£223m, but this has risen to Â£321m. However, the overall estimated project cost is much higher and is not included in the report due to commercial sensitivity. Costain believes the Welsh Government's estimated share is understated. The WAO said the level of disruption to local communities had been greater than expected. Six weekend closures had initially been agreed for safety reasons, but by the end of November the section of A465 had been closed for 57 weekends. Mr Crompton said: ""This is not the first time that the Welsh Government has faced difficulties with significant cost increases and delays on road projects and it is vital that lessons are learnt for future infrastructure schemes."" This video can not be played Heads of the Valleys dualling ""has been hell"" The scheme involves replacing the old three-lane road, with builders fitting the new road into the gorge with split carriageways - with one part on a different level to the other - utilising a number of retaining walls. These have formed part of one of several complicated legal disputes as the parties argue how to deal with increased construction costs. According to the report, elements of the design developed by Costain for the walls were considered by the firm to be ""impossible and/or illegal to construct in compliance with relevant standards/regulations or have been changed for other reasons"". ""The changed designs are costing significantly more to construct"", the report said. Arbitration led to the Welsh Government and Costain splitting the increase, but the two parties remain in dispute about who is liable for a significant portion of the increase in cost. Economy Minister Ken Skates says the road is more than 85% complete Other issues have included asbestos found at a former factory site, where the Welsh Government had to foot the bill. Legal fees have mounted - with the Welsh Government having spent Â£1.49m by last November. Economy Minister Ken Skates said on Tuesday that builders have delayed the end date to April 2021. ""I am obviously very disappointed by this further delay and have asked the project team to continue to explore what can be done to bring forward these programmed dates,"" he added. Mr Skates said a total of 65% of the project's cash has been spend with Welsh firms, with 270 new jobs created and 69 apprentices trained. Helen Mary Jones, Plaid Cymru economy spokeswoman, said: ""There are clearly serious issues with this project and for the sake of public interest, the Welsh Government must release all details so that real scrutiny can take place."" Welsh Conservative business spokesman Russell George said: ""It is not first time that the Welsh Labour Government has managed roads projects that have suffered significant cost increases and delays, and its increasingly vital that lessons are learnt, and learnt now, for future infrastructure schemes."" The Welsh Government said the project was ""widely recognised as one of the most complex road engineering projects in the UK at the moment"". It added: ""We recognise the frustration caused by the issues highlighted in the report, and will of course consider its findings.""

Orlando Bloom fixes incorrect tattoo of son's name,"Orlando Bloom learnt the hard way that his new tattoo was incorrect - people on the internet told him about it. Earlier this month he shared a photo of a new tattoo on his arm, which was meant to be his son's name Flynn written in Morse code. The mistake wasn't huge (just one missing dot) but it was enough for the actor to get the ink amended and re-posted on his Instagram. ""Finally dot it right! How do you make a mistake like that?"" he wrote. Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

""Babe you spelled it wrong,"" one follower commented on Orlando's original Instagram post. Another had pointed out that it actually read ""Frynn"" not Flynn."" Orlando's tattooist - Balazs Bercsenyi - corrected the work and added the name of the actor's former dog, Sidi, which is spelled correctly. ""We added the missing dot to the Morse Code, and did a small one in memory of Sidi, his dog,""Balazs wrote on Instagram.,external ""Conclusion: never fully trust what your clients find on Pinterest. Life is officially back to normal."" Ricky Williams runs a tattoo studio in London. He says it's really important that people wanting to get a tattoo, especially if it involves words or language, do their research first. ""You need to make sure that wherever you source it from is legitimate,"" he tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. Ricky says it's common for people to take text they want tattooed from a Google search, and when it's another language - such as Morse Code or something like Arabic - recommends someone who has a knowledge of it check it before you take it to a tattooist. ""I don't speak or write in Arabic for example, so I'm trusting you more than me,"" Ricky says. Ricky says it would be unprofessional not to point out a mistake to a client, but it's their responsibility to do research first He says doing research into available tattooists is also important to make sure the customer can trust the studio they choose to do what they want, whether it's text or an image. And it's common for people to come to his studio with requests to fix other tattooist's work. ""You can go anywhere and get a tattoo because there's loads of studios everywhere,"" he says. ""But just because someone owns a tattoo shop doesn't mean that their work is any good. ""You get people that go to the nearest tattoo shop because that's all they know. Then they get a bad one and that's when they do their research to find someone who is actually good."" The tattoo artist is happy to admit he's made his own mistake - he once tattooed ""serenitiy"" instead of ""serenity"" on a customer's face. ""I put it on Instagram but my colleague commented saying to remove it because I'd spelled it wrong,"" Ricky says. ""I had to call the customer back into the studio so we could see how to rectify it."" He says the script used on this tattoo meant it was one that could be easily fixed. Ricky admits he made a mistake once when tattooing a client's face For people who have mistakes in their tattoos, or just have ink they don't like any more, Ricky advises laser removal instead of trying to cover it up with a new tattoo. ""Laser is a good option, because a tattooist could just be making more of a mess,"" he says. ""So that's what I tell everybody now. Basically, I don't just go in and do it."" He says covering up older tattoos is a complicated and difficult process which isn't as straightforward as reality shows like Channel 4's Tattoo Fixers might suggest. Mistakes and bad ink can happen to the best of us, and being famous does not protect you from ending up with a typo tattooed onto your skin. Just ask Ariana Grande - who ended up with""small charcoal grill"",externalwritten in Japanese on her hand when what she wanted was lyrics from her hit 7 Rings. Harry Styles had incorrect lyrics by Australian band The Temper Trap inked on his arm, and that wasspotted by the band themselves.,external And Rihanna ended up with some grammatically confusing French tattooed on her neck - ""rebelle fleur""-which some said meant nothing at all,,externalbut which she argued made perfect sense.

Women rescued from rivers following flooding,"This video can not be played 'I feel really upset': Pentre homes flooded twice in day A blockage believed to have caused flooding in a village was the result of woodland cut down by Natural Resources Wales, the body has said. Pentre in Rhondda Cynon Taff flooded a second time in five days after the culvert collapsed under felled trees. Rhondda MP Chris Bryant said the damage in the village could cost up to Â£5m. Meanwhile firefighters rescued a woman who was clinging to a branch in a fast-flowing river, while another was saved from the roof of a submerged car. Thursday's yellow warning for rain covered 19 of Wales' 22 local authority areas, with some areas in the north expected to see up to 100mm (4in) of rain. NRW admitted felled trees blocked a culvert, causing the flooding in Pentre NRW said engineers had been checking flood defences and carrying out urgent repairs and clearing blockages. However Mr Bryant said the government-sponsored body had ""questions to answer"" for not keeping culverts clear and should set up a multi-million pound compensation fund. His comments followed flooding in Pleasant Street, Pentre, following the collapsed culvert. Residents called the situation ""horrific"" and said houses had suffered severe damage. NRW confirmed 95% of the Pentre woodland had been felled in a bid to tackle Larch disease. Bill Purvis, NRW duty tactical manger, said: ""From the photographs and pictures available it is evident that wooded material entered the watercourse and ended up blocking the grid. ""A review will be undertaken of our operations so that we learn lessons and can make improvements to ensure this doesn't happen again."" Three homes in Pentre, Rhondda were hit by flooding Forecasters had predicted a month's rain could fall in north Wales over 24 hours and the fire service warned people not to drive through floodwater. Twenty firefighters from Mid and West Wales fire service rescued a woman clinging to a branch near Brecon promenade, Powys, at 03:00 GMT on Thursday. The Welsh Ambulance Service said she was taken to hospital. A second woman was also rescued from the roof of a submerged car on the Wales/England border near Chepstow on Tuesday, fire chiefs confirmed. Mark Smith, 51, told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire show how hewaded into Â­floodwateron the banks of the River Wye to rescue the woman who had been trapped for 12 hours near St Briavels in the Forest of Dean. Mark Smith waded into the water after being alerted by Geoff Handley Some Rhondda Cynon Taf council staff were moved out of their offices at Clydach Vale amid concerns of a potential landslide nearby, but have since returned. The authority said it was also drawing up plans to rebuild a damaged wall on the River Rhondda at Blaencwm. Why Wales is prone to landslides In pictures: Storm Dennis brings flooding to Wales Leader Andrew Morgan said up to 1,000 properties had been affected by flooding and 20 families were being housed in temporary accommodation. ""On top of that we had massive damage to infrastructure. At least three possibly four bridges will need to be completely replaced,"" he added. In Bridgend, council engineers were checking 41 former coal mining sites in the Ogmore, Garw and Llynfi valleys to ensure they are safe. The Coal Authority confirmed it was also checking sites they might have responsibility for. Donations at Trallwn Community Centre in Pontypridd for flood victims Residents in Ynysybwl have complained that sandbags delivered on Thursday were too little, too late. Paul Thomas lives on Clydach Terrace where 19 houses were flooded on Saturday night by water that was ""over head height"". ""Outlying areas like ours don't get the money or support and we've only now been given sandbags,"" he said. ""However the level of water exceeded the four sandbags we got by about five feet, so they would have been a total waste of time anyway."" Paul Thomas shows how high the water level rose in house in Ynysybwl Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn visited Rhydyfelin in Pontypridd on Thursday and criticised the UK government's response as ""wholly inadequate"". Mr Corbyn said Boris Johnson was showing his ""true colours"", adding: ""If the prime minister is not campaigning for votes in a general election he simply does not care about helping communities affected by flooding."" Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price also questioned why Mr Johnson had not convened Cobra, the UK government's emergency response committee. In response, a UK government spokesman said flood defences and the response to flooding were devolved to the Welsh Government. ""The UK government has communicated with emergency services, local authorities and the Welsh Government - including the first minister - throughout the past week and we are ready to provide assistance, where possible, should additional help be required,"" he said. Jeremy Corbyn visited Rhydyfelin on Thursday AWelsh Government summit was held on Wednesdaywith councils and other agencies to look at the problems caused by flooding. First Minister Mark Drakeford toldBBC Breakfast: ""This is a genuine emergency and we are working to mobilise every bit of help we can for families."" Meanwhile, the Plaid Cymru leader of Carmarthenshire council has accused the Welsh Government of ""favouritism"" when it comes to dealing with the aftermath of flooding. Emlyn Dole toldNewyddion 9the Labour-led Welsh Government had ""reacted in the areas that they are strongest"". He added: ""So far there has been no reaction to what happened with Storm Callum 18 months ago, whilst there has been a reaction straightaway to what has happened this time. ""Our people had the same serious situation last time - but there wasn't a penny to help."" A Welsh Government spokesman said the impact and severity of storms Ciara and Dennis had been unprecedented, adding: ""We will always ensure we do everything we can to support everyone affected."" The River Dee, at Llangollen, Denbighshire, was raging Prince Charles, the Prince of Wales, is due to visit Pontypridd on Friday to speak to home owners forced to leave their properties and the rescuers who saved many from rising waters. And Hollywood actor Michael Sheen, from Port Talbot, haslaunched a crowdfunding campaignto help flooded communities. ""The devastation that Storm Dennis has left behind is very real and thousands of people across the UK have lost everything,"" he said. The Welsh Rugby Union has also set up afund to help rugby clubs affected by the weather. The water treatment works in Monmouth were left inaccessible after river levels rose to record highs Water bottle stations were set up in Monmouth after fears hundreds of homes could be left without supply after Welsh Water's treatment site was flooded. Managing director Peter Perry said it could take up to 48 hours to get the Mayhill plant up and running. How dangerous is floodwater? What should I do if I'm hit by flooding? South Wales Fire and Rescue Service have warned of the potential dangers of carbon monoxide poisoning from using gas-powered power generators during the clean-up. Network Rail has reopened the Treherbert line, Heart of Wales line and the Cambrian lines, however the following lines remain closed: Ebbw Vale Line (north of Cross Keys) Abergavenny to Hereford Valleys Aberdare line Conwy Valley line Cars abandoned due to the flooding of the River Wye in Monmouth are being recovered BBC reporter Nicky Smith reports from Treforest I have spent time at Treforest Industrial Estate and what I witnessed was dirt, damage and despair. In the businesses I spoke to, they are only just beginning to understand the financial cost of Storm Dennis and, in each one I stopped at, they talked of it running to thousands of pounds. Harry Singh, owner of the Welsh Shop, said his stock had been ruined in the middle of the Six Nations But in all the mess, there is one very clear message. They will do everything in their power to stay open for business. Harry Singh, who owns the Welsh Shop which stores its stock here, showed me piles of merchandise ruined by the flood water - he believes he has lost up to Â£400,000 worth of stock. The impact is even worse as this is one of their busiest times, in the middle of the Six Nations rugby championship, and he has not been able to fulfil online orders. Paul Cooper's home was damaged when a roof was swept into his garden from about 400m away A couple whose home was damaged and a roof was swept into their garden during the floods, told me they would not be able to return home for up to 18 months. Paul Cooper said they felt a bit lost following the news and, like many others, hoped for good news soon. BBC reporter Matt Murray in Pontypridd and Nantgarw Lynn Davies said the damage was ""absolutely soul destroying"" Roads are now crowded with skips, tractors and trailers clearing debris, rubbish, and cars that have been written off. There's a realisation by those affected just how life-changing this will be for them. Self-employed builder Lynn Davies had just finished refurbishing his home when it was flooded and all his tools and van, which he needs to work, were also ruined. He is now living in a hotel with his family and dogs and says it may be five months before they can return home. There's also anger here as people feel they were alerted too late to the risk of the flood waters hitting their homes. BBC reporter Rhys Williams in Ystradgynlais Engineers are surveying the damage on the Teddy Bear Bridge in Ystradgynlais, Powys, after part of the bridge collapsed on Tuesday The Teddy Bear Bridge - so-called because miners teetering across the previous rickety bridge to get to work looked like teddy bears - is one of the victims of the heavy rain in Ystradgynlais. The more modern bridge is still standing, but there's a huge crack in the wall and the structure has buckled considerably. The storm has also caused flooding for residents in Ystalyfera, where the community is banding together and reminding people of the ""good old days"" when everyone pitched in together to help out. On Wednesday residents were in their third day of clearing out the downstairs of their homes into bags to be collected by the council. Lenny Jenkins has spent the day clearing out his home, ruined by the water. Like the rest of his street, he says has no insurance as no company will ""go near us."" Most of his neighbours have been re-housed by the council. He's worried the community in the area is going to suffer as people leave the street.

'Far-right extremist' behind Germany killings,"This video can not be played Eyewitnesses filmed the aftermath of the shooting A suspected far-right extremist has killed at least nine people in attacks on two shisha bars in a city in western Germany, officials say. Chancellor Angela Merkel said there were many signs the attacker in Hanau had acted out of racism. Federal prosecutors are treating the case as terrorism. Turkey says at least five of the dead were Turkish citizens. The 43-year-old suspect killed himself, police say. He was found dead at his home along with the body of his mother. Local media have identified the suspect as Tobias R, a German citizen. The Bild tabloid reports he had a firearms licence, and that ammunition and gun magazines were found in his car. What we know so far Authorities are examining a video that appears to be from the suspect, posted online days before the attacks, in which he expresses right-wing conspiracy theories. German media say he also left a letter of confession. The attack comes amid growing concerns about far-right violence in Germany. Speaking in Berlin, Mrs Merkel said: ""Racism is a poison. Hate is a poison and this poison exists in our society and is already to blame for many crimes."" This video can not be played German Chancellor Angela Merkel gives a statement in Berlin The shootings took place around 22:00 (21:00 GMT) on Wednesday, and the first target was the Midnight shisha bar in the city centre of Hanau. Witnesses reported hearing about a dozen gunshots. The suspect then travelled in a dark car to the Kesselstadt neighbourhood, some 2.5km (1.5 mile) away, and opened fire at the Arena Bar & Cafe. Shisha bars are places where people gather to smoke a pipe known as shisha or hookah. Traditionally found in Middle Eastern and Asian countries, they are also popular in many other parts of the world. Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said he expected the German government to make ""necessary efforts to throw light on all aspects"" of the attack. The Arena Bar & Cafe was one of the places targeted The shootings sparked an hours-long manhunt through the night while officers, supported by helicopters, searched for what they thought could have been more than one attacker. Police identified the gunman through information from witnesses and surveillance cameras. Early on Thursday, they stormed the suspect's home, near the scene of the second shooting, and found him dead near his 72-year-old mother. Can-Luca Frisenna, whose father and brother run one of the two bars attacked, told Reuters news agency: ""I heard my father was affected and my little brother... I saw them both - they were horrified and they were crying and everything. So everyone was shocked."" Hanau, in Hesse state, is a city of 100,000 residents about 25km east of Frankfurt. Hesse Interior Minister Peter Beuth said authorities were also examining a website attributed to the suspect. ""What we know so far is that there is definitely a xenophobic motive. Whether there are claims of responsibility or documents, that's still being investigated,"" he said. The suspect was not known to the authorities, Mr Beuth added. The suspect has been identified by local media as Tobias R In a brief statement, Mrs Merkel also vowed to do everything possible to clarify the background to the attack, saying: ""There are many indications at the moment that the perpetrator acted on right-wing extremist, racist motives, out of hatred towards people of other origins, religion or appearance."" Gun laws in Germany are among the most stringent in the world, and were tightened further in recent years after other mass shootings. Nazi salutes, banned swastika emblems and even the playing of the Horst Wessel, the one-time Nazi 'anthem' - all have been cropping up in far right extremist circles as Germany struggles to contain a growing wave of home-grown extremism. The problem has been particularly acute in - but not confined to - the east of the country, in the former East Germany. There, unemployment levels have been higher than in the rest of Germany and a simmering resentment by some of recent immigrant arrivals has manifested itself in arson attacks on hostels. In 2015 Germany opened its borders to an estimated 1.5 million refugees from the Middle East. Although the number of subsequent incidents involving them has been very small, their arrival has been used by far right extremists to stoke ethnic tensions and recruit more young men and women to their cause. October 2019:In Halle, an attacker kills two and tries to storm a synagogue, broadcasting the assault live online.He later admits a far-right, anti-Semitic motivefor the attack June 2019:Walter LÃ¼bcke, a pro-migrant politician, is shot in the head at close range and found dead in his garden.A suspect with far-right links later confesses to the murder July 2016:An 18-year-old shoots dead nine people at a shopping mall in Munich before killing himself. Bavarian authorities later classify the attack as ""politically motivated"", saying the teen had ""radical right-wing and racist views"" Hanau Mayor Claus Kaminsky said it had been the ""hardest day in our history"". He said the city had seen centuries of peaceful coexistence between different faiths and cultures - ""That is why it is so hard to understand"". Katja Leikert, who represents Hanau in the German parliament, the Bundestag, said: ""Hopefully the injured recover swiftly. It is a horrific scenario for us all."" Hesse state leader Volker Bouffier said the state parliament had travelled to Hanau to show its solidarity with the victims and their families. He said the attack ""came out of a climate"" that existed ""to some degree worldwide"" in which people are targeted because they are different. ""We will do everything to show that people don't have to be afraid and show them that they belong with us, "" he said. In other reaction: German Defence Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer: ""The background must now be clarified further. Violence from right-wing extremists must not let us rest, we must stand against it"" Ursula von der Leyen, European Commission President and former German government minister: ""I am deeply shocked by the tragedy that took place... in Hanau"" French President Emmanuel Macron: ""Immense sadness and my full support for Germany in the face of this tragic attack... I stand with Chancellor Merkel in this fight for our values and the protection of our democracies"" Germany's Muslim association KRM called for more to be done in the fight against right-wing extremism, saying they had requested for month that needed to be ""a clear stand against Islamophobia"" Were you in the area?

Britons on virus-hit cruise ship to be flown home,"The ship has been docked in Yokohama, a city south of Tokyo, since 3 February Britons stranded on a quarantined cruise ship in Japan will be able to board an evacuation flight home on Friday, the foreign secretary has said. Only those who are showing no signs of illness will be able to travel, and they will be quarantined on their return to the UK. Those who have tested positive will remain in Japan for treatment. Dominic Raab said the flight would be from Tokyo, and urged any other Britons who wanted to leave to get in touch. There were 78 British nationals on board the Diamond Princess cruise liner when it was quarantined on 5 February, after a man who disembarked in Hong Kong was found to have the virus. More than 620 people onboard the cruise ship - which was carrying 3,700 passengers - have tested positive for the condition. It is the largest cluster of cases outside China. Two passengers from the ship have now died. The Japanese citizens were in their 80s and had underlying health conditions, local media said. One of the passengers from the ship catching a taxi after being allowed to leave On Wednesday, when the two-week quarantine period on the liner expired, officials allowed passengers who had tested negative for the virus to disembark. But the Foreign Office advised all UK nationals to stay onboard until it organised an evacuation flight for them, warning there could be administrative problems if they left the ship. Two passengers dead from virus-hit cruise ship How a virus reveals the many ways China is feared What impact will coronavirus have on the Olympics? Coronavirus: What you need to know Earlier, Mr Raab said a UK-chartered flight had been arranged, with details sent to those who had registered for the flight. It is expected to land at Boscombe Down, a Ministry of Defence base in Wiltshire, early on Saturday morning. Some passengers who had disembarked left on buses The cruise operator and Japanese officials allowed passengers to leave on Wednesday, UK time Those returning from the ship will spend 14 days at Arrowe Park Hospital in Wirral, where two groups of people travelling from China have already been taken. ""There is no risk to the public, and the hospital will continue to run as normal,"" the Department of Health said. Meanwhile, one of the British passengers who has tested positive for the virus has posted a picture of himself in a hospital bed in Japan. David Abel revealed earlier this week that he and his wife Sally had both been told they had the virus. David Abel and his wife Sally, from Northamptonshire, are being treated in a hospital in Japan Another British passenger, Alan Sandford, and his wife Vanessa were both ""very happy"" about the prospect of returning home to Nottinghamshire after being found not to have contracted the virus. He told BBC Breakfast the last few weeks had been ""a major inconvenience"" but that other passengers had faced ""horrific"" circumstances such as getting ill, being seperated from their partners or being trapped inside cabins without windows. Alan Sandford says he and his wife have their fingers crossed they will be on the evacuation flight to the UK Meanwhile, British honeymooner Alan Steele, who was diagnosed with coronavirus on the cruise ship, announced on Facebook that he had left hospital and was in a hotel in Yokohama - ahead of his return to the UK. Japanhas faced criticismover its handling of the outbreak, with one health expert calling the situation onboard ""completely chaotic"". The Foreign Office is advising affected British nationals affected to call the British embassy in Tokyo on +81 3 5211 1100. Elsewhere, any British passengers on board a cruise ship docked in Cambodia amid fears of an outbreak will not be treated as being at high risk of coronavirus, Public Health England (PHE) has said. The MS Westerdam made shore in Sihanoukville on 13 February, after being rejected by five countries because one of its former passengers was found to be carrying the virus. The ship was originally carrying 2,257 people - including a reported 100 Britons - with the majority having already disembarked  - leaving 255 passengers and 747 crew members on board. The majority of passengers have disembarked the MS Westerdam Cambodia, pictured here at Preah Sihanouk port last week PHE said any of the ship's passengers flying back to the UK will be asked to self-isolate when they return. In China, Covid-19 - the illness brought on by the coronavirus - has now claimed 2,004 lives, according to the latest Chinese data released on Wednesday. There have been 74,185 confirmed infections recorded in mainland China and about 700 cases in other countries. In the UK, a total of 5,549 people had been tested for the virus,as of Thursday at 14:00 GMT,external. Only nine people have tested positive.

Parts of UK could see a month's rain in 24 hours,"Flood water continues to surround areas such as Upton upon Severn in Worcestershire Flood warnings remain in place across the UK after parts of north-west England experienced more than a month's worth of rain in the last 24 hours. Two areas in Cumbria, Seathwaite and Honister Pass, recorded more rain than the county's February average of 112mm. Nearly 100 flood warnings remain across the UK - six of them in England severe, meaning there is a danger to life. Thesevere warnings,externalare across the Midlands near the Welsh border around the Rivers Lugg, Severn and Wye. Flooding 'is going to get worse' Four ways to stop flooding In pictures: Flooding from Storm Dennis Just how wet has this winter been? Hundreds of people have been evacuated from their homes due to floods, with the worst-affected areas including south Wales, Herefordshire, Worcestershire and Shropshire. In Gloucestershire,more than 300 people staying on a travellers' site have been strandedby flood water. Also in the county, a man has told of how hewaded into floodwater to rescue a woman who had been trapped on the roof of her submerged car for 12 hours. Mark Smith, 51, told theVictoria Derbyshire programme: ""I could hear someone shouting for help. She was half in the car and half in the water."" In Wales, a blockage believed to have caused flooding in a village was found to have been caused bywoodland cut down by Natural Resources Wales, a government-sponsored body. Earlier,firefighters in Brecon rescued a woman who was clinging to a branchin a fast-flowing river.

He said volunteers turned up at 06:00 GMT on Sunday to help sweep out the mud - only to see it flooded once again on Monday. ""I don't know what we will do until it dries, which could take weeks. I've got no money coming in and a mortgage to pay but I'm also worried about my staff,"" he told the BBC. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has faced criticism from opposition parties for not visiting flood-hit communities. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he was showing his ""true colours by his absence"", adding that the prime minister was sending a ""clear message"" by not convening the government's emergency committee, Cobra. Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price also questioned why Mr Johnson had not convened Cobra. Fire Brigades Union general secretary Matt Wrack said his union had been raising the issue of long-term planning to deal with extreme weather events for years, but had found the government's response to be ""lacklustre"". On Wednesday, business minister Nadhim Zahawi told Sky News the prime minister was focused on getting ""money out the door"" to businesses and local authorities in affected communities. ""He wants to help people by getting funding to them,"" Mr Zahawi said. Environment Secretary George Eustice said the government was investing Â£2.6bn in flood defences.

'Birdgirl' to receive honorary doctorate at 17,"Mya-Rose Craig is thought to be Britain's youngest receiver of the Doctorate of Science from the University of Bristol A teenage birdwatcher has urged students to ""tackle the environmental crisis"" as she received an honorary doctorate at the age of 17. Mya-Rose Craig, also known as Birdgirl, set up Black2Nature to help engage more children from minority ethnic backgrounds (BAME) in conservation. She received the doctor of science degree from the University of Bristol. The environmentalist posts on Twitter as BirdGirlUK and is thought to be the UK's youngest recipient of the award. Mya-Rose Craig is currently studying English literature, Spanish and media studies at A-level and will sit her exams in May Accepting the accolade she said everybody from every community should ""tackle the environmental crisis we find ourselves in"". ""Now more than ever, it is important to recognise that inequality of engagement creates inequality of opportunity and an unequal world is not a sustainable one,"" she said. ""I hope that everyone will have their light bulb moment, like I did, when they realise what they really care about and want to fight for."" She called for those graduating to use their skills to ""really go out and change the world for the better"". The 17-year-old began running nature camps when she was 13 Ms Craig was nominated for the honorary degree by Dr Rich Pancost, head of earth sciences at the university. ""To bestow a comparable honour on someone who is only 17 years old is not a decision we take lightly,"" Dr Pancost said. ""It is reserved for those who are leading truly special projects, courageous projects, transformative projects. ""Mya-Rose is doing exactly that."" TV presenter and nature enthusiast Bill Oddie said initially he had been ""somewhat confused"" when he started getting emails from ""BirdGirl"". He said: ""A super hero?  Well, actually yes Myra-Rose is exactly that. ""Intelligent, informed, passionate, and persistent, whatever the cause, such qualities are what gets things done,"" he added. Mya-Rose Craig has met David Attenborough She is currently studying English literature, Spanish and media studies at A-level and will sit her exams in May, and plans to take a gap year before going to university to study politics and international relations. Her mother Helena Craig said it was ""astonishing"" her daughter was to become the youngest person in the country to receive an honorary doctorate. She added: ""Mya speaking out about race and diversity in the environmental movement has attracted certain people and negativity. ""It's been difficult, so it's good that she is now getting that recognition."" Teen creates nature camps for BAME children Who is Greta Thunberg? 'Why I'm getting teenagers into birdwatching' Prof Pancost, ex-director of the Bristol Cabot Institute who also nominated Mya-Rose, said he felt ""proud"" to see her receive the doctorate as she had created a ""phenomenal amount of positive change"" for nature. ""She is a champion for diversity and equity in the environmental and conservation sector, challenging institutions but also creating and driving transformative projects like Black2Nature,"" he said.

Gas heating to be banned in Scotland's castles,"Historic Environment Scotland manages more than 300 properties, including Edinburgh Castle Gas heating is to be eliminated from all Historic Environment Scotland (HES) buildings, including Edinburgh Castle, by 2032. HES said it aimed to be ""net-zero"" by 2045 in line with the Scottish government's target. The organisation plans to reduce the amount of visitor vehicles by 2028 by creating parking hubs where it has clusters of properties. Low carbon ""district heating"" systems could also be used on some sites. District heating takesenergy released as heat and transfers it elsewhere,externalusing highly insulated pipes. HES said it could be installed on properties in highly populated areas. The public body is one of Scotland's biggest operators of tourists sites that attract millions of visitors each year. It manages more than 300 properties, including Stirling Castle and Linlithgow Palace. Jane Ryder, chair of HES, said: ""In the past year, international heritage experts have come to Scotland to work with us to develop pioneering methods to better understand the climate change threat to World Heritage sites. ""In addition to piloting some ground-breaking approaches, we've hosted the launch of a new international network which has united cultural heritage organisations from across the globe to take action against climate change. ""And now we're setting out our most ambitious climate change plans to date. The Climate Action Plan will transform how we operate as an organisation, increasing resilience and making our business more effective and efficient while placing environmental responsibility at the heart of everything we do."" The body said it also planned to invest in cycling infrastructure for staff and visitors The plan sets out how HES aims to reduce its carbon footprint over the coming years. It intends to reduce its vehicle fleet by 30% by 2025 and, where practicable, have fully electric cars. Investment will also be made in cycling infrastructure for staff and visitors. The use of taxis will be heavily curtailed with an aim to reduce use by 80% by 2022. Culture Secretary Fiona Hyslop said: ""The historic environment has a critical role to play in our response to the global climate emergency. ""This Climate Action Plan recognises the scale of the challenge we face and the need for immediate and widespread action. ""I welcome the commitment Historic Environment Scotland is making to meeting our ambitious emissions targets and look forward to seeing the results of its work in the coming years.""

'Birdgirl' to receive honorary doctorate at 17Mya-Rose Craig has been campaigning for equality in the environmental movement since 2015.Bristol,"Mya-Rose Craig is thought to be Britain's youngest receiver of the Doctorate of Science from the University of Bristol A teenage birdwatcher has urged students to ""tackle the environmental crisis"" as she received an honorary doctorate at the age of 17. Mya-Rose Craig, also known as Birdgirl, set up Black2Nature to help engage more children from minority ethnic backgrounds (BAME) in conservation. She received the doctor of science degree from the University of Bristol. The environmentalist posts on Twitter as BirdGirlUK and is thought to be the UK's youngest recipient of the award. Mya-Rose Craig is currently studying English literature, Spanish and media studies at A-level and will sit her exams in May Accepting the accolade she said everybody from every community should ""tackle the environmental crisis we find ourselves in"". ""Now more than ever, it is important to recognise that inequality of engagement creates inequality of opportunity and an unequal world is not a sustainable one,"" she said. ""I hope that everyone will have their light bulb moment, like I did, when they realise what they really care about and want to fight for."" She called for those graduating to use their skills to ""really go out and change the world for the better"". The 17-year-old began running nature camps when she was 13 Ms Craig was nominated for the honorary degree by Dr Rich Pancost, head of earth sciences at the university. ""To bestow a comparable honour on someone who is only 17 years old is not a decision we take lightly,"" Dr Pancost said. ""It is reserved for those who are leading truly special projects, courageous projects, transformative projects. ""Mya-Rose is doing exactly that."" TV presenter and nature enthusiast Bill Oddie said initially he had been ""somewhat confused"" when he started getting emails from ""BirdGirl"". He said: ""A super hero?  Well, actually yes Myra-Rose is exactly that. ""Intelligent, informed, passionate, and persistent, whatever the cause, such qualities are what gets things done,"" he added. Mya-Rose Craig has met David Attenborough She is currently studying English literature, Spanish and media studies at A-level and will sit her exams in May, and plans to take a gap year before going to university to study politics and international relations. Her mother Helena Craig said it was ""astonishing"" her daughter was to become the youngest person in the country to receive an honorary doctorate. She added: ""Mya speaking out about race and diversity in the environmental movement has attracted certain people and negativity. ""It's been difficult, so it's good that she is now getting that recognition."" Teen creates nature camps for BAME children Who is Greta Thunberg? 'Why I'm getting teenagers into birdwatching' Prof Pancost, ex-director of the Bristol Cabot Institute who also nominated Mya-Rose, said he felt ""proud"" to see her receive the doctorate as she had created a ""phenomenal amount of positive change"" for nature. ""She is a champion for diversity and equity in the environmental and conservation sector, challenging institutions but also creating and driving transformative projects like Black2Nature,"" he said.

"'Cut, copy and paste' inventor dies","Larry Tesler, pictured at the PC Forum in 1989, worked to make computers more accessible Larry Tesler, an icon of early computing, has died at the age of 74. Mr Tesler started working in Silicon Valley in the early 1960s, at a time when computers were inaccessible to the vast majority of people. It was thanks to his innovations - which included the ""cut"", ""copy"" and ""paste"" commands - that the personal computer became simple to learn and use. Xerox, where Mr Tesler spent part of his career, paid tribute to him. ""The inventor of cut/copy & paste, find & replace, and more, was former Xerox researcher Larry Tesler,"" the company tweeted. ""Your workday is easier thanks to his revolutionary ideas."" Mr Tesler was born in the Bronx, New York, in 1945, and studied at Stanford University in California. Larry Tesler: The Silicon Valley history man After graduating, he specialised in user interface design - that is, making computer systems more user-friendly. He worked for a number of major tech firms during his long career. He started at Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (Parc), before Steve Jobs poached him for Apple, where he spent 17 years and rose to chief scientist. After leaving Apple he set up an education start-up, and worked for brief periods at Amazon and Yahoo. This video can not be played Larry Tesler talks to Rory Cellan-Jones In 2012, he told the BBC of Silicon Valley: ""There's almost a rite of passage - after you've made some money, you don't just retire, you spend your time funding other companies. ""There's a very strong element of excitement, of being able to share what you've learned with the next generation."" Possibly Mr Tesler's most famous innovation, the cut and paste command, was reportedly based on the old method of editing in which people would physically cut portions of printed text and glue them elsewhere. The command was incorporated in Apple's software on the Lisa computer in 1983, and the original Macintosh that was released the following year. Mr Tesler, pictured in 1991, was an avowed opponent of computer ""modes"" One of Mr Tesler's firmest beliefs was that computer systems should stop using ""modes"", which were common in software design at the time. Modes allow users to switch between functions on software and apps but make computers both time-consuming and complicated. So strong was this belief that Mr Tesler's website was called ""nomodes.com"", his Twitter handle was ""@nomodes"", and even his car's registration plate was ""No Modes"". Silicon Valley's Computer History Museum said Mr Tesler ""combined computer science training with a counterculture vision that computers should be for everyone"".

Lloyds pays Â£2.5bn to deal with final PPI claims,"A surge in complaints about mis-sold payment protection insurance (PPI) weighed on Lloyds' finances last year. The UK banking giantposted a 26% drop,externalin pre-tax profits to Â£4.4bn as it paid out billions of pounds to customers in PPI compensation. The bill for PPI claims in 2019 would be about Â£2.5bn, but Lloyds said no further provisions were needed as it had already set aside enough money. It brings the total paid out by Lloyds over the mis-selling saga to Â£21.9bn. Lloyds said there had been a ""significant increase"" in queries about PPI claims ahead of a deadline to claim in August last year. The deadline, set by the City regulator, prompted a rush of enquiries, which pushed the bank's bill up from Â£750m in 2018. ""The group's statutory performance was impacted by a substantial PPI charge related to the deadline for claims submission,"" the bank's boss AntÃ³nio Horta-OsÃ³rio, said in a statement. Lloyds has the biggest bill of all the banks for mis-selling of the insurance policy - which was intended to cover loan payments if, for instance, customers fell ill. But the insurance was often sold to people who did not want it or did not need it. In the run up to the deadline, Lloyds said it had received about 5 million new claims but only about 10% of those resulted in a compensation payment. ""Historic conduct issues remain disappointing but we continue to be focused on doing the right thing for our customers,"" Mr Horta-Osorio said. Last year, Lloydsfaced criticism for its handling of a multi-million pound scamat a branch of HBOS, which it now owns. Mr Horta-Osorio promised to implement recommendations of a report that said a scheme to compensate customers had ""serious shortcomings"". ""We have apologised to those impacted and are determined to put things right,"" he said. Despite the surge in PPI claims, John Moore, an investment manager at Brewin Dolphin, said Lloyds appeared to be in a ""decent place"". ""Lloyds' performance is typically a reflection of the wider UK economic situation,"" he said. ""Political uncertainty influenced business and consumer confidence last year; yet, despite this challenge, the bank has posted resilient results."" Mr Horta-Osorio took the helm after bank was rescued during the 2008 financial crisis. The government sold its final stake in the bank in 2017.

"Urgent action needed on prison pressures, say MSPs","Barlinnie dates from the 19th Century MSPs say ""urgent action"" is needed to address the pressure on Scotland's overcrowded prisons. Holyrood's public audit committee said conditions in the largest jail, HMP Barlinnie in Glasgow, were so poor that a contingency plan was needed in case it became uninhabitable. The report warned ""if Barlinnie fails, the whole prison system is at risk"". Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf told BBC Scotland contingency plans were in place. However, he said a ""catastrophic failure"" was not anticipated at the prison. The Scottish Prison Service (SPS) said its challenges had been recognised with increased funding. But thereport from Holyrood's public audit committee,externalsaid an increase in demand and ""10 years of capital under spend"" were to blame for the pressures on the prison service. Scotland's prisons 'bursting at seams' as many over capacity Warning over prisoner numbers 'exceeding capacity' More money needed for prisons, says Holyrood's justice committee Public audit committee convener and Labour MSP Jenny Marra said there were ""significant and wide-ranging challenges"" for the SPS and Scottish government to overcome. She told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme: ""Barlinnie is the oldest jail in Scotland. It's a Victorian building. It's 50% over-capacity. The state of the building is deteriorating and what the committee found was that the SPS has no contingency plan. ""If that building were to fail then the SPS didn't have an answer for us on where those 1,500 prisoners would go."" She added that the SPS needed to be in ""better shape"" to deal with the challenges it faced across Scotland. In December last year,a report from Holyrood's justice committeecalled for more money to be given to the SPS after Audit Scotland said that, in real terms, the prison service's revenue budget had dropped by 14.2% over five years. Wendy Sinclair-Gieben, the chief inspector of prisons for Scotland, has previously described conditions at Barlinnie as ""shocking"". Areplacement for Barlinnieis currently expected by 2025 but the public audit committee report warns possible delays to the project must be planned for. They also describe suggestions to double-up prisoners in individual cells at other jails would be a ""a step backwards rather than forwards"". The report points out that payments to prison staff doing extra work to cover absences has nearly doubled in the space of three years as a result of a surge in sickness absence and prisoner numbers at high levels. HMP Barlinnie in Glasgow is operating over capacity and has been described as the ""biggest risk of failure"" in the prison estate A SPS spokeswoman said: ""The safety and wellbeing of those living and working in our prisons is a priority for the SPS and it is to the credit of our staff that good order is maintained across our estate. ""It is well documented that the SPS is managing an increased prison population who have challenging and complex needs. ""The recent budget announcement by the Scottish government acknowledges the significant challenges the service faces, particularly in response to population numbers, and our settlement for 2020-21 has increased in recognition of these pressures."" Humza Yousaf told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme: ""For every single part of the prison estate we have a contingency plan, for example if there were to be some sort of catastrophic failure. ""We would move them [prisoners] partly across the estate but there may be other solutions that we would also have to look at as well, but nobody is anticipating a catastrophic failure at Barlinnie. ""What we're anticipating is investment going into the current estate, including Barlinnie, building the new Barlinnie and of course working with the prison estate to see what other further improvements can be made. ""But of course, ultimately, if we reduce the prison population we ease the pressure on Barlinnie, we ease the pressure right across the estate.""

Woman rescued from river following flooding,"This video can not be played 'I feel really upset': Pentre homes flooded twice in day A blockage believed to have caused flooding in a village was the result of woodland cut down by Natural Resources Wales, the body has said. Pentre in Rhondda Cynon Taff flooded a second time in five days after the culvert collapsed under felled trees. Rhondda MP Chris Bryant said the damage in the village could cost up to Â£5m. Meanwhile firefighters rescued a woman who was clinging to a branch in a fast-flowing river, while another was saved from the roof of a submerged car. Thursday's yellow warning for rain covered 19 of Wales' 22 local authority areas, with some areas in the north expected to see up to 100mm (4in) of rain. NRW admitted felled trees blocked a culvert, causing the flooding in Pentre NRW said engineers had been checking flood defences and carrying out urgent repairs and clearing blockages. However Mr Bryant said the government-sponsored body had ""questions to answer"" for not keeping culverts clear and should set up a multi-million pound compensation fund. His comments followed flooding in Pleasant Street, Pentre, following the collapsed culvert. Residents called the situation ""horrific"" and said houses had suffered severe damage. NRW confirmed 95% of the Pentre woodland had been felled in a bid to tackle Larch disease. Bill Purvis, NRW duty tactical manger, said: ""From the photographs and pictures available it is evident that wooded material entered the watercourse and ended up blocking the grid. ""A review will be undertaken of our operations so that we learn lessons and can make improvements to ensure this doesn't happen again."" Three homes in Pentre, Rhondda were hit by flooding Forecasters had predicted a month's rain could fall in north Wales over 24 hours and the fire service warned people not to drive through floodwater. Twenty firefighters from Mid and West Wales fire service rescued a woman clinging to a branch near Brecon promenade, Powys, at 03:00 GMT on Thursday. The Welsh Ambulance Service said she was taken to hospital. A second woman was also rescued from the roof of a submerged car on the Wales/England border near Chepstow on Tuesday, fire chiefs confirmed. Mark Smith, 51, told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire show how hewaded into Â­floodwateron the banks of the River Wye to rescue the woman who had been trapped for 12 hours near St Briavels in the Forest of Dean. Mark Smith waded into the water after being alerted by Geoff Handley Some Rhondda Cynon Taf council staff were moved out of their offices at Clydach Vale amid concerns of a potential landslide nearby, but have since returned. The authority said it was also drawing up plans to rebuild a damaged wall on the River Rhondda at Blaencwm. Why Wales is prone to landslides In pictures: Storm Dennis brings flooding to Wales Leader Andrew Morgan said up to 1,000 properties had been affected by flooding and 20 families were being housed in temporary accommodation. ""On top of that we had massive damage to infrastructure. At least three possibly four bridges will need to be completely replaced,"" he added. In Bridgend, council engineers were checking 41 former coal mining sites in the Ogmore, Garw and Llynfi valleys to ensure they are safe. The Coal Authority confirmed it was also checking sites they might have responsibility for. Donations at Trallwn Community Centre in Pontypridd for flood victims Residents in Ynysybwl have complained that sandbags delivered on Thursday were too little, too late. Paul Thomas lives on Clydach Terrace where 19 houses were flooded on Saturday night by water that was ""over head height"". ""Outlying areas like ours don't get the money or support and we've only now been given sandbags,"" he said. ""However the level of water exceeded the four sandbags we got by about five feet, so they would have been a total waste of time anyway."" Paul Thomas shows how high the water level rose in house in Ynysybwl Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn visited Rhydyfelin in Pontypridd on Thursday and criticised the UK government's response as ""wholly inadequate"". Mr Corbyn said Boris Johnson was showing his ""true colours"", adding: ""If the prime minister is not campaigning for votes in a general election he simply does not care about helping communities affected by flooding."" Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price also questioned why Mr Johnson had not convened Cobra, the UK government's emergency response committee. In response, a UK government spokesman said flood defences and the response to flooding were devolved to the Welsh Government. ""The UK government has communicated with emergency services, local authorities and the Welsh Government - including the first minister - throughout the past week and we are ready to provide assistance, where possible, should additional help be required,"" he said. Jeremy Corbyn visited Rhydyfelin on Thursday AWelsh Government summit was held on Wednesdaywith councils and other agencies to look at the problems caused by flooding. First Minister Mark Drakeford toldBBC Breakfast: ""This is a genuine emergency and we are working to mobilise every bit of help we can for families."" Meanwhile, the Plaid Cymru leader of Carmarthenshire council has accused the Welsh Government of ""favouritism"" when it comes to dealing with the aftermath of flooding. Emlyn Dole toldNewyddion 9the Labour-led Welsh Government had ""reacted in the areas that they are strongest"". He added: ""So far there has been no reaction to what happened with Storm Callum 18 months ago, whilst there has been a reaction straightaway to what has happened this time. ""Our people had the same serious situation last time - but there wasn't a penny to help."" A Welsh Government spokesman said the impact and severity of storms Ciara and Dennis had been unprecedented, adding: ""We will always ensure we do everything we can to support everyone affected."" The River Dee, at Llangollen, Denbighshire, was raging Prince Charles, the Prince of Wales, is due to visit Pontypridd on Friday to speak to home owners forced to leave their properties and the rescuers who saved many from rising waters. And Hollywood actor Michael Sheen, from Port Talbot, haslaunched a crowdfunding campaignto help flooded communities. ""The devastation that Storm Dennis has left behind is very real and thousands of people across the UK have lost everything,"" he said. The Welsh Rugby Union has also set up afund to help rugby clubs affected by the weather. The water treatment works in Monmouth were left inaccessible after river levels rose to record highs Water bottle stations were set up in Monmouth after fears hundreds of homes could be left without supply after Welsh Water's treatment site was flooded. Managing director Peter Perry said it could take up to 48 hours to get the Mayhill plant up and running. How dangerous is floodwater? What should I do if I'm hit by flooding? South Wales Fire and Rescue Service have warned of the potential dangers of carbon monoxide poisoning from using gas-powered power generators during the clean-up. Network Rail has reopened the Treherbert line, Heart of Wales line and the Cambrian lines, however the following lines remain closed: Ebbw Vale Line (north of Cross Keys) Abergavenny to Hereford Valleys Aberdare line Conwy Valley line Cars abandoned due to the flooding of the River Wye in Monmouth are being recovered BBC reporter Nicky Smith reports from Treforest I have spent time at Treforest Industrial Estate and what I witnessed was dirt, damage and despair. In the businesses I spoke to, they are only just beginning to understand the financial cost of Storm Dennis and, in each one I stopped at, they talked of it running to thousands of pounds. Harry Singh, owner of the Welsh Shop, said his stock had been ruined in the middle of the Six Nations But in all the mess, there is one very clear message. They will do everything in their power to stay open for business. Harry Singh, who owns the Welsh Shop which stores its stock here, showed me piles of merchandise ruined by the flood water - he believes he has lost up to Â£400,000 worth of stock. The impact is even worse as this is one of their busiest times, in the middle of the Six Nations rugby championship, and he has not been able to fulfil online orders. Paul Cooper's home was damaged when a roof was swept into his garden from about 400m away A couple whose home was damaged and a roof was swept into their garden during the floods, told me they would not be able to return home for up to 18 months. Paul Cooper said they felt a bit lost following the news and, like many others, hoped for good news soon. BBC reporter Matt Murray in Pontypridd and Nantgarw Lynn Davies said the damage was ""absolutely soul destroying"" Roads are now crowded with skips, tractors and trailers clearing debris, rubbish, and cars that have been written off. There's a realisation by those affected just how life-changing this will be for them. Self-employed builder Lynn Davies had just finished refurbishing his home when it was flooded and all his tools and van, which he needs to work, were also ruined. He is now living in a hotel with his family and dogs and says it may be five months before they can return home. There's also anger here as people feel they were alerted too late to the risk of the flood waters hitting their homes. BBC reporter Rhys Williams in Ystradgynlais Engineers are surveying the damage on the Teddy Bear Bridge in Ystradgynlais, Powys, after part of the bridge collapsed on Tuesday The Teddy Bear Bridge - so-called because miners teetering across the previous rickety bridge to get to work looked like teddy bears - is one of the victims of the heavy rain in Ystradgynlais. The more modern bridge is still standing, but there's a huge crack in the wall and the structure has buckled considerably. The storm has also caused flooding for residents in Ystalyfera, where the community is banding together and reminding people of the ""good old days"" when everyone pitched in together to help out. On Wednesday residents were in their third day of clearing out the downstairs of their homes into bags to be collected by the council. Lenny Jenkins has spent the day clearing out his home, ruined by the water. Like the rest of his street, he says has no insurance as no company will ""go near us."" Most of his neighbours have been re-housed by the council. He's worried the community in the area is going to suffer as people leave the street.

Delayed road-widening scheme Â£100m over budgetThe project has been hit by delays and disputes between the Welsh Government and its contractor.Wales politics,"The project is aimed at improving safety on the A465 and regenerating the region's economy Wales' biggest road building project is costing taxpayers about Â£100m more than planned, a new report has said. Transforming the A465 into a dual carriageway between Gilwern and Brynmawr was meant to be finished by September 2018 but is now pegged for completion in April 2021. Auditor general Adrian Crompton said those living locally were paying a ""higher than expected price"". The Welsh Government said the scheme was complex, but would bring benefits. The five mile-long project in the Clydach Gorge has been hit by legal disputes between the Welsh Government and road builder Costain. The geology of the area has been at the centre of the challenges and what has been found on site has been more difficult to build on than anticipated. Both sides have argued over who should pay for the increase in cost. The Wales Audit Office (WAO) report into the delays said it was impossible to say how long the dispute would take to resolve and the uncertainty meant it was difficult for the Welsh Government to predict the final figure. Major road project could face more delays over row Dispute over Â£51m road overspend More delays to Heads of the Valleys road upgrade It is part of a larger project to widen the A465 and was first envisaged in 1994. In 2014, costs to the public purse were estimated by the Welsh Government at Â£223m, but this has risen to Â£321m. However, the overall estimated project cost is much higher and is not included in the report due to commercial sensitivity. Costain believes the Welsh Government's estimated share is understated. The WAO said the level of disruption to local communities had been greater than expected. Six weekend closures had initially been agreed for safety reasons, but by the end of November the section of A465 had been closed for 57 weekends. Mr Crompton said: ""This is not the first time that the Welsh Government has faced difficulties with significant cost increases and delays on road projects and it is vital that lessons are learnt for future infrastructure schemes."" This video can not be played Heads of the Valleys dualling ""has been hell"" The scheme involves replacing the old three-lane road, with builders fitting the new road into the gorge with split carriageways - with one part on a different level to the other - utilising a number of retaining walls. These have formed part of one of several complicated legal disputes as the parties argue how to deal with increased construction costs. According to the report, elements of the design developed by Costain for the walls were considered by the firm to be ""impossible and/or illegal to construct in compliance with relevant standards/regulations or have been changed for other reasons"". ""The changed designs are costing significantly more to construct"", the report said. Arbitration led to the Welsh Government and Costain splitting the increase, but the two parties remain in dispute about who is liable for a significant portion of the increase in cost. Economy Minister Ken Skates says the road is more than 85% complete Other issues have included asbestos found at a former factory site, where the Welsh Government had to foot the bill. Legal fees have mounted - with the Welsh Government having spent Â£1.49m by last November. Economy Minister Ken Skates said on Tuesday that builders have delayed the end date to April 2021. ""I am obviously very disappointed by this further delay and have asked the project team to continue to explore what can be done to bring forward these programmed dates,"" he added. Mr Skates said a total of 65% of the project's cash has been spend with Welsh firms, with 270 new jobs created and 69 apprentices trained. Helen Mary Jones, Plaid Cymru economy spokeswoman, said: ""There are clearly serious issues with this project and for the sake of public interest, the Welsh Government must release all details so that real scrutiny can take place."" Welsh Conservative business spokesman Russell George said: ""It is not first time that the Welsh Labour Government has managed roads projects that have suffered significant cost increases and delays, and its increasingly vital that lessons are learnt, and learnt now, for future infrastructure schemes."" The Welsh Government said the project was ""widely recognised as one of the most complex road engineering projects in the UK at the moment"". It added: ""We recognise the frustration caused by the issues highlighted in the report, and will of course consider its findings.""

UK set for month's worth of rain in 24 hours,"Flood water continues to surround areas such as Upton upon Severn in Worcestershire Flood warnings remain in place across the UK after parts of north-west England experienced more than a month's worth of rain in the last 24 hours. Two areas in Cumbria, Seathwaite and Honister Pass, recorded more rain than the county's February average of 112mm. Nearly 100 flood warnings remain across the UK - six of them in England severe, meaning there is a danger to life. Thesevere warnings,externalare across the Midlands near the Welsh border around the Rivers Lugg, Severn and Wye. Flooding 'is going to get worse' Four ways to stop flooding In pictures: Flooding from Storm Dennis Just how wet has this winter been? Hundreds of people have been evacuated from their homes due to floods, with the worst-affected areas including south Wales, Herefordshire, Worcestershire and Shropshire. In Gloucestershire,more than 300 people staying on a travellers' site have been strandedby flood water. Also in the county, a man has told of how hewaded into floodwater to rescue a woman who had been trapped on the roof of her submerged car for 12 hours. Mark Smith, 51, told theVictoria Derbyshire programme: ""I could hear someone shouting for help. She was half in the car and half in the water."" In Wales, a blockage believed to have caused flooding in a village was found to have been caused bywoodland cut down by Natural Resources Wales, a government-sponsored body. Earlier,firefighters in Brecon rescued a woman who was clinging to a branchin a fast-flowing river.

He said volunteers turned up at 06:00 GMT on Sunday to help sweep out the mud - only to see it flooded once again on Monday. ""I don't know what we will do until it dries, which could take weeks. I've got no money coming in and a mortgage to pay but I'm also worried about my staff,"" he told the BBC. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has faced criticism from opposition parties for not visiting flood-hit communities. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he was showing his ""true colours by his absence"", adding that the prime minister was sending a ""clear message"" by not convening the government's emergency committee, Cobra. Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price also questioned why Mr Johnson had not convened Cobra. Fire Brigades Union general secretary Matt Wrack said his union had been raising the issue of long-term planning to deal with extreme weather events for years, but had found the government's response to be ""lacklustre"". On Wednesday, business minister Nadhim Zahawi told Sky News the prime minister was focused on getting ""money out the door"" to businesses and local authorities in affected communities. ""He wants to help people by getting funding to them,"" Mr Zahawi said. Environment Secretary George Eustice said the government was investing Â£2.6bn in flood defences. Latest on floods in the West Midlands Wales: Flood-hit areas braced for more rain How dangerous is floodwater? There was heavy rain across northern and western parts of Britain overnight and during Thursday. In Cumbria, in Honister Pass, 178mm of rain fell in 24 hours, while in Seathwaite 158mm of rain was recorded. According to the Environment Agency, England has already received 141% of its average February rainfall so far this month. River levels in the Colne, Ribble, Calder, Aire, Trent, Severn, Wye, Lugg, and Derwent all set new records in recent days, it added.

"Flack's family releases unpublished Instagram postIn a post released ahead of her inquest, the TV host said her ""future was swept from under my feet"".Entertainment & ArtsNo visas for low-skilled workers, government saysMinisters urge firms to stop relying on ""cheap labour"", but critics warn of damage to the economy.UK PoliticsComments","Caroline Flack's family have released an unpublished Instagram post that they say she wrote shortly before she died. It came ahead of the inquest into the death of the former Love Island host, which opened on Wednesday. The inquest heardthat the 40-year-old presenter was apparently found hanged in her London flat on Saturday. The unpublished post said her ""whole world and future was swept from under my feet"" when she had been arrested for assaulting her boyfriend in December. Her mother said Flack had been advised not to publish the message, which has now been shared throughthe Eastern Daily Press.,external The TV presenter wasfound dead in her homeweeks before she was due to stand trial on charges of assaulting her boyfriend Lewis Burton. Flack pleaded not guilty to the alleged assault at a court hearing in December and was released on bail. She was ordered to stop any contact with Mr Burton ahead of the trial, which was due to begin in March. Will Caroline Flack's death be a turning point? Who decides if someone should face trial? Flack's mother Chris told the Norfolk newspaper that her daughter showed her the wording of the post in January, but was told not to post it by advisers. She added that the family wanted people to read it. ""Carrie sent me this message at the end of January but was told not to post it by advisers but she so wanted to have her little voice heard,"" she said, according to the paper. ""So many untruths were out there but this is how she felt and my family and I would like people to read her own words. ""Carrie was surrounded by love and friends but this was just too much for her."" If you or someone you know needs support for issues about emotional distress,these organisationsmay be able to help. ""For a lot of people, being arrested for common assault is an extreme way to have some sort of spiritual awakening but for me it's become the normal. ""I've been pressing the snooze button on many stresses in my life - for my whole life. I've accepted shame and toxic opinions on my life for over 10 years and yet told myself it's all part of my job. No complaining. ""The problem with brushing things under the carpet is they are still there and one day someone is going to lift that carpet up and all you are going to feel is shame and embarrassment. ""On December the 12th 2019 I was arrested for common assault on my boyfriend. Within 24 hours my whole world and future was swept from under my feet and all the walls that I had taken so long to build around me collapsed. I am suddenly on a different kind of stage and everyone is watching it happen. ""I have always taken responsibility for what happened that night. Even on the night. But the truth is... It was an accident. ""I've been having some sort of emotional breakdown for a very long time. ""But I am NOT a domestic abuser. We had an argument and an accident happened. An accident. The blood that someone SOLD to a newspaper was MY blood and that was something very sad and very personal. ""The reason I am talking today is because my family can't take anymore. I've lost my job. My home. My ability to speak. And the truth has been taken out of my hands and used as entertainment. ""I can't spend every day hidden away being told not to say or speak to anyone.

Germany country profile,"Germany is Europe's largest economy and the most populous country in the European Union. Achieving national unity later than other European nations, Germany quickly caught up economically and militarily, before defeats in World War One and World War Two left it shattered, facing the difficult legacy of Nazism and divided between Europe's Cold War blocs. After 1949, West Germany rebounded to become the continent's economic giant and a prime mover of European cooperation. Franco-German cooperation was central to European economic integration in the 1980s and 1990s. With the end of the Cold War, the two parts of the country were once again united, although the economy of the former east continues to lag behind the rest of the country. Since reunification, Germany has taken a more active role in the European Union, signing the Maastricht Treaty in 1992 and the Lisbon Treaty in 2007 and co-founding the Eurozone. Read morecountry profiles,external- Profiles byBBC Monitoring,external Capital:Berlin Area:357,022 sq km Population:83.6 million Language:German Life expectancy:78 years (men) 83 years (women) Chancellor:Olaf Scholz The 63-year-old former finance minister defied earlier expectations by winning the September 2021 election. He formed a coalition with the Greens and business-friendly Free Democrats in December, becoming the first Social Democrat chancellor since 2005. He took over from the Christian Democrat Angela Merkel, Germany's first female chancellor, who governed for 16 years in coalition with either the Free Democrats or the Social Democrats. Mr Scholz was her vice-chancellor as well as finance minister in 2018-2021. Despite having a much more restrained and cautious response than that of other Western countries to Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Scholz oversaw an increase in Germany's defence budget, weapons shipments to Ukraine and a discontinuance of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. Scholz set out the principles of a new German defence policy in his ""Zeitenwende"" speech to parliament immediately after the invasion. Scholz described the attack as a ""historic turning point"" and announced that in response his government would use a â¬100bn fund to significantly increase military spending, reversing Germany's previously cautious defence policy. President: Frank-Walter Steinmeier Former foreign minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier was elected federal president in February 2017, succeeding Joachim Gauck. He was reelected in February 2022 for a second five-year term as Germany's president. Although largely ceremonial post, he has been seen as a symbol of consensus and continuity. His lenient policies toward countries such as Russia and China have earned him criticism both in Germany and internationally.

"BT scammers jailed for 'sophisticated' Â£358k fraudThe group infiltrated more than 2,000 BT customer accounts and used the details to buy luxury goods.Hampshire & Isle of Wight","Clockwise from top left: Festus Emosivwe, Charles Onwu, Victor Ngo, Chloe Maylott, Olukayode Adepoju, Molade Fasuyi and Adel Qadir Scammers who infiltrated BT customer accounts as part of a ""sophisticated"" Â£358,000 fraud have been jailed. The gang targeted in excess of 2,000 people, predominantly in the Portsmouth area, between May 2014 and July 2016. They used the details to set up Paypal accounts to order expensive items which were then delivered to addresses in the city controlled by the group. Seven people were jailed for between 16 and 44 months for their part in the fraud. An eighth defendant was fined Â£1,000. Portsmouth Crown Court heard the gang spent the money on Rolex watches, high-value jewellery, TVs and designer clothes. Police carried out raids after being given information by BT, and group leader Festus Emosivwe, 36, put a USB data stick in his mouth and chewed on it when police arrested him, making it impossible to recover any data. The gang spent the money on luxury goods including watches and jewellery Prosecutor Michael Forster said the source of all the data leaks was not known, but there was evidence of phishing emails and officers found textbooks on computer security at Emosivwe's home. He described it as ""a sophisticated conspiracy"" that ""persisted for two years"". The barrister said the gang diverted customers' email addresses and phones to accounts controlled by the group, meaning victims were ""left in the dark"" until their money had been fraudulently spent. He said although Paypal had lost the most money from the fraud, BT customers had endured ""distress and inconvenience"". Sentencing the group, Judge Timothy Mousley QC said: ""The impact on your victims cannot be underestimated. Many had seriously heightened levels of anxiety, stress and fear after finding out their accounts had been hacked. ""Some expressed horror and fury at being scammed by you. ""Many were retired people who feared they'd be unable to get by financially. Each of you is responsible for inflicting that misery upon them."" Geoffrey Noble said he experienced a ""sense of panic"" when he realised he had been defrauded One of the victims, 69-year-old Geoffrey Noble, told the BBC he discovered his details had been used to buy Â£3,000 worth of goods shortly after being diagnosed with cancer. In a statement read out on his behalf in court, he said he was ""furious"" at the fraudsters as ""nobody has the right to take the money I worked so hard for"". ""I experienced a sense of panic and fear because I did not know where it was going to end,"" he added. The gang, who pleaded guilty to all charges, were sentenced as follows: Festus Emosivwe, 36, of Newcome Road, Portsmouth, was jailed for 44 months for conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation. Chloe Maylott, 27, of Purbrook Way, Havant, was jailed for 16 months for conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation. Charles Onwu, 31, of Wells Close, Portsmouth, was jailed for 43 months for conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation Victor Ngo, 30, of Lowestoft Road, Portsmouth, was jailed for 43 months for conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation and conspiracy to convert criminal property. Pinelopi Chatzikonstantinou, 30, formerly of Highlands Road, Southsea, was fined Â£1,000 and a Â£100 victim surcharge for conspiracy to convert criminal property. Adel Qadir, 35, of Woofferton Road, Portsmouth, was jailed for 29 months for conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation. Molade Fasuyi, 37, of Methuen Road, Southsea, was jailed for two years for committing fraud by false representation. Olukayode Adepoju, 40, of London Road, Portsmouth, was jailed for 19 months for conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation.

"Eight dead in mass shooting in Hanau, Germany","This video can not be played Eyewitnesses filmed the aftermath of the shooting A suspected far-right extremist has killed at least nine people in attacks on two shisha bars in a city in western Germany, officials say. Chancellor Angela Merkel said there were many signs the attacker in Hanau had acted out of racism. Federal prosecutors are treating the case as terrorism. Turkey says at least five of the dead were Turkish citizens. The 43-year-old suspect killed himself, police say. He was found dead at his home along with the body of his mother. Local media have identified the suspect as Tobias R, a German citizen. The Bild tabloid reports he had a firearms licence, and that ammunition and gun magazines were found in his car. What we know so far Authorities are examining a video that appears to be from the suspect, posted online days before the attacks, in which he expresses right-wing conspiracy theories. German media say he also left a letter of confession. The attack comes amid growing concerns about far-right violence in Germany. Speaking in Berlin, Mrs Merkel said: ""Racism is a poison. Hate is a poison and this poison exists in our society and is already to blame for many crimes."" This video can not be played German Chancellor Angela Merkel gives a statement in Berlin The shootings took place around 22:00 (21:00 GMT) on Wednesday, and the first target was the Midnight shisha bar in the city centre of Hanau. Witnesses reported hearing about a dozen gunshots. The suspect then travelled in a dark car to the Kesselstadt neighbourhood, some 2.5km (1.5 mile) away, and opened fire at the Arena Bar & Cafe. Shisha bars are places where people gather to smoke a pipe known as shisha or hookah. Traditionally found in Middle Eastern and Asian countries, they are also popular in many other parts of the world. Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said he expected the German government to make ""necessary efforts to throw light on all aspects"" of the attack. The Arena Bar & Cafe was one of the places targeted The shootings sparked an hours-long manhunt through the night while officers, supported by helicopters, searched for what they thought could have been more than one attacker. Police identified the gunman through information from witnesses and surveillance cameras. Early on Thursday, they stormed the suspect's home, near the scene of the second shooting, and found him dead near his 72-year-old mother. Can-Luca Frisenna, whose father and brother run one of the two bars attacked, told Reuters news agency: ""I heard my father was affected and my little brother... I saw them both - they were horrified and they were crying and everything. So everyone was shocked."" Hanau, in Hesse state, is a city of 100,000 residents about 25km east of Frankfurt. Hesse Interior Minister Peter Beuth said authorities were also examining a website attributed to the suspect. ""What we know so far is that there is definitely a xenophobic motive. Whether there are claims of responsibility or documents, that's still being investigated,"" he said. The suspect was not known to the authorities, Mr Beuth added. The suspect has been identified by local media as Tobias R In a brief statement, Mrs Merkel also vowed to do everything possible to clarify the background to the attack, saying: ""There are many indications at the moment that the perpetrator acted on right-wing extremist, racist motives, out of hatred towards people of other origins, religion or appearance."" Gun laws in Germany are among the most stringent in the world, and were tightened further in recent years after other mass shootings. Nazi salutes, banned swastika emblems and even the playing of the Horst Wessel, the one-time Nazi 'anthem' - all have been cropping up in far right extremist circles as Germany struggles to contain a growing wave of home-grown extremism. The problem has been particularly acute in - but not confined to - the east of the country, in the former East Germany. There, unemployment levels have been higher than in the rest of Germany and a simmering resentment by some of recent immigrant arrivals has manifested itself in arson attacks on hostels. In 2015 Germany opened its borders to an estimated 1.5 million refugees from the Middle East. Although the number of subsequent incidents involving them has been very small, their arrival has been used by far right extremists to stoke ethnic tensions and recruit more young men and women to their cause. October 2019:In Halle, an attacker kills two and tries to storm a synagogue, broadcasting the assault live online.He later admits a far-right, anti-Semitic motivefor the attack June 2019:Walter LÃ¼bcke, a pro-migrant politician, is shot in the head at close range and found dead in his garden.A suspect with far-right links later confesses to the murder July 2016:An 18-year-old shoots dead nine people at a shopping mall in Munich before killing himself. Bavarian authorities later classify the attack as ""politically motivated"", saying the teen had ""radical right-wing and racist views"" Hanau Mayor Claus Kaminsky said it had been the ""hardest day in our history"". He said the city had seen centuries of peaceful coexistence between different faiths and cultures - ""That is why it is so hard to understand"". Katja Leikert, who represents Hanau in the German parliament, the Bundestag, said: ""Hopefully the injured recover swiftly. It is a horrific scenario for us all."" Hesse state leader Volker Bouffier said the state parliament had travelled to Hanau to show its solidarity with the victims and their families. He said the attack ""came out of a climate"" that existed ""to some degree worldwide"" in which people are targeted because they are different. ""We will do everything to show that people don't have to be afraid and show them that they belong with us, "" he said. In other reaction: German Defence Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer: ""The background must now be clarified further. Violence from right-wing extremists must not let us rest, we must stand against it"" Ursula von der Leyen, European Commission President and former German government minister: ""I am deeply shocked by the tragedy that took place... in Hanau"" French President Emmanuel Macron: ""Immense sadness and my full support for Germany in the face of this tragic attack... I stand with Chancellor Merkel in this fight for our values and the protection of our democracies"" Germany's Muslim association KRM called for more to be done in the fight against right-wing extremism, saying they had requested for month that needed to be ""a clear stand against Islamophobia"" Were you in the area?
