Dutch gig cancelled over terror tip-off,"The van was found in a street near the venue A van containing gas canisters has been discovered near a music venue in Rotterdam, hours after a tip-off from Spanish police led to the cancellation of a rock concert. The driver of the Spain-registered van was detained by police, Mayor Ahmed Aboutaleb told journalists. US band Allah-Las - who often get threats because of their name - had been due to perform at The Maassilo. But the warning led to the gig being called off at the last minute. Spanish attacks: What we know However, Mr Aboutaleb said it was not clear if the van and the terror threat were linked. The warning came amid a heightened sense of alert after attacks in Spain last week. But a judicial sources told Reuters news agency that there was no direct link between those attacks and the tip from Spanish authorities, which is said to be the result of a longstanding investigation. Dutch police have arrested the Spanish driver of the van and taken him for questioning. A bomb squad was examining the vehicle, reports said. Police wearing bulletproof vests were at the venue, which was evacuated. Gas canisters were found in a van near the venue ""The ring that the police set up around the concert hall led to the detention of a van with gas bottles,"" Mr Aboutaleb said. ""Whether the van with gas bottles can be linked to the threat, that cannot now be established,"" he added, warning against ""swift conclusions"". In last week's attacks in Catalonia, 15 people were killed in Barcelona and the town of Cambrils. Those attacks followed a blast at a house full of gas canisters where the jihadists involved were reportedly preparing explosives. Barcelona and Cambrils attacks: What we know so far In an interview last year, the group Allah-Lastold,externalThe Guardian newspaper that they regularly received messages from Muslims offended by the use of the word Allah - Arabic for God - in their name.

Cyclist guilty over pedestrian's death,"Kim Briggs died after being injured while crossing Old Street in Shoreditch in February A cyclist who knocked over and killed a 44-year-old woman in east London last year has been cleared of her manslaughter. But Charlie Alliston, 20, was found guilty of causing bodily harm by ""wanton or furious driving"". Alliston was riding a fixed gear bike with no front brakes when he hit mum-of-two Kim Briggs as she was crossing the road in her lunch break. She suffered serious head injuries and died a week later in hospital. Alliston later went online to defend himself following the crash, claiming Mrs Briggs was at fault before deleting the comment when he realised how serious her injuries were. He told the Old Bailey his comments had been stupid and not thought through. Charlie Alliston went online to defend himself following the crash Alliston was riding a fixie - a fixed-wheel bicycle with no front brake used by track racing cyclists - across a junction on Old Street, Shoreditch, last February when he said he saw HR consultant Mrs Briggs step out into the road while looking at her phone. He told the court he shouted to warn her and slowed down to between 10 and 14 miles an hour. Alliston said he shouted again and swerved to avoid her but Mrs Briggs stepped back into his path. He claimed he was not aware a brake was a legal requirement to ride on the road and said even with one he wouldn't have been able to stop in time. But crash investigators who studied CCTV of the incident concluded Alliston would have been able to stop and avoid the collision if the bike had been fitted with a front brake. The law explained in the Commentaries on the Laws of England, published in 1867 Alliston was charged with an admittedly archaic offence - but it is the closest to dangerous driving a cyclist can be charged with. Unlike a dangerous cycling charge, causing GBH by wanton and furious driving takes into account injury. It may sound slightly eccentric, but perhaps it is down to its wording which was coined in 1861. Introduced under the Offences Against the Person Act, the charge was created to deter people from driving horse carriages recklessly. It is now used when it is not possible to prosecute under the Road Traffic Act 1988 - ie, when the vehicle in the crime was not mechanically propelled -  and in cases of serious injury or death caused by a cyclist's actions. It carries a maximum penalty of two years' imprisonment and/or an unlimited fine. Previous successful prosecutions under the offence include those against cyclistsDarryl GittoesandDarren Hall,external, who both knocked down pedestrians who later died. Alliston is due to be sentenced on 18 September and could be jailed for up to two years Judge Wendy Joseph QC ordered a pre-sentence report, but made it clear she was considering a jail sentence for Alliston. She said: ""I have not seen one iota of remorse from Mr Alliston at all at any stage."" He is due to be sentenced on 18 September. In a statement read in court, Matthew Briggs paid tribute to his ""wonderful"" wife, with whom he had a daughter aged 11 and a son aged 14. He said: ""She was quick to smile, slow to judge and even slower to anger."" The case has raised questions about safety and responsibility on the road. Mrs Briggs' family said they plan to campaign for tougher cycling laws to protect pedestrians. Mr Briggs described the trial as ""gruelling and painful"". He added: ""Out of this senseless carnage, I shall try to bring change to the law and change to attitudes. ""Perhaps in this way I can honour my wife."" Duncan Dollimore, head of advocacy and campaigns at Cycling UK, said: ""Riding a fixed wheel bicycle on busy roads without a front brake is illegal, stupid and endangers other road users especially pedestrians. ""Charlie Alliston's actions had tragic consequences for Kim Briggs' family and it was entirely right that this led to his prosecution."" Alliston's fixed-wheel track bike is the sort more commonly seen at an Olympic velodrome, being raced at great speeds. In evidence, he told jurors he had no idea there were regulations that ""fixies"" have to have front brakes for use on the road. The Pedal Cycle Construction and Use Regulations 1983 states a fixed wheel bicycle must have a front brake in addition to the rear fixed wheel before it can be lawfully ridden on a public road. A fixed-wheel counts as a rear brake, however it needs a calliper on the front to legally ride it on a public road.

Food firms warn of EU worker shortage,"The UK food industry has warned that a Brexit workforce shortage could leave a third of its businesses unviable. The Food and Drink Federation said: ""Our sector faces a rapidly approaching workforce shortage and skills gap."" Its survey of the ""farm-to-fork"" supply chain said 31% of businesses had already seen EU workers leave the UK. The FDA's survey was conducted across a wide range of respected trade bodies, including the British Retail Consortium and the National Famers Union. It added that almost half of those businesses surveyed said EU nationals working in the UK were considering leaving. Big net migration fall since Brexit vote, latest estimates show The federation is calling on the government to guarantee the rights of nationals from across the European Economic Area. Ian Wright, its director-general, said: ""It is only a matter of time before the uncertainty reported by businesses results in an irreversible exit of EU workers from these shores. ""Without our dedicated and valued workforce we would be unable to feed the nation."" In April a report by the CommonsEnvironment Food and Rural Affairs Committee said:,external""Evidence... suggests the current problem is in danger of becoming a crisis if urgent measures are not taken to fill the gaps in labour supply."" A ""cliff-edge"" Brexit would disrupt the whole food supply chain, the FDF warns A government spokesperson said: ""In June we published our offer to protect the rights of EU citizens in the UK, confirming no-one living here lawfully will be asked to leave when we exit the EU and they will have a grace period to regularise their status."" The federation said it had welcomed the government's announcement. However, of the businesses it surveyed: 47% said EU nationals were considering leaving the UK 36% said they would become unviable if they had no access to EU workers 31% reported EU nationals leaving since the referendum 17% said they may relocate overseas if they had no access to EU nationals The federation is calling on the government to ensure there is no abrupt reduction in the number of EU workers in the UK the day the country leaves the EU. Mr Wright told the BBC: ""What we don't want is a sudden switch-off of the availability of EU workers who are part of the lifeblood of our industry."" Almost a third of food and drink firms have seen EU workers leave the UK He added that there were a lot of practicalities in the government's plans for EU workers ""that we don't know yet"". ""We don't know how much it's going to cost. We don't know how dependents will be treated,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme. ""And crucially, in order to believe the scheme is going to work, you have to believe the Home Office can register two and a half million Europeans in a year. That defies some level of belief."" Last month the National Farmers Union deputy president Minette Batters said: ""The NFU cannot emphasise enough the urgent need for clarity and certainty on access to a competent and reliable workforce and all other issues relating to Brexit. ""The industry needs commitments that there will be sufficient numbers of permanent and seasonal workers from outside the UK post-Brexit."" The government said in a statement: ""After we leave the EU we must have an immigration system which works in the best interests of the UK. ""Crucial to the development of this will be the views from a range of businesses, including the agricultural, food, drink and manufacturing sectors. ""We will be setting out our initial proposals for this system in the autumn but we have already been clear there will be an implementation period after we leave the EU to avoid a cliff edge for businesses."" In the longer term, the federation accepts it will have to adjust to the reduction in the number of EU workers. ""Over time [training local workers] is something that will have to happen as a result of the Brexit vote. We recognise that immigration was a big factor in the Brexit vote,"" Mr Wright said. To deal with fewer foreign workers, the federation will have a strong emphasis on building skills through apprenticeships and investment in technology to support automation, it said. The survey was co-ordinated by the FDA, and as well as the BRC and the NFU, it gathered results from trade bodies the Association of Labour Providers, the British Beer and Pub Association, the British Hospitality Association, the Food and Drink Federation, and the Fresh Produce Consortium. It said that across the various workforce surveys there were 627 responses, collectively representing almost a quarter of the food chain's total employment of four million people.

'No-brakes cyclist' and migration mistake,"A variety of stories take up the front pages of Thursday's newspapers, including the trial of cyclist Charlie Alliston who was found guilty by an Old Bailey jury of causing bodily harm by ""wanton or furious driving"". The Metro,externalreports on how the 20-year-old, who hit pedestrian Kim Briggs whilst riding a bike with no front brake in east London last February, was cleared of manslaughter. Kim Briggs died after the collision in east London The 44-year-old suffered two skull fractures and died in hospital a week later. The newspaper quotes Judge Wendy Joseph QC, who said she had not seen ""one iota of remorse"" from Mr Alliston. The Daily Telegraph,externalsays the Home Office has ordered a review of Britain's immigration figures after new border checks suggested there might be fewer migrants in the country than previously thought. The newspaper says tens of thousands of non-EU students were believed to have remained in the UK illegally, but the checks found that 97% had left after finishing their studies. It says officials are suggesting the overall net migration total could be significantly reduced and Theresa May could be closer to achieving her target of reducing the figure to less than 100,000 a year.

The return of the band who burned Â£1m,"This video can not be played The KLF return 23 years after bowing out of the music industry On 23 August 1994, The KLF - one of Britain's most incendiary bands, in more ways than one - burned Â£1m on a remote Scottish island. They then vowed to put their careers on hold for 23 years. That time is now up. So at 23 seconds past midnight on Wednesday they made their comeback at a book launch in Liverpool. The duo were greeted by 500 fans as they arrived at the News From Nowhere book shop in an ice cream van that played their hit What Time Is Love? and O Sole Mio. That marked the start ofa three-day festival,externalof talks, performance and live art, which will continue on Wednesday with a debate on the topic ""Why Did the K Foundation Burn a Million Quid?"" However, fans have been told that The KLF's Jimmy Cauty and Bill Drummond will not be performing any music. Bill Drummond and Jimmy Cauty made their comeback at a bookshop in Liverpool Their new novel 2023, described as ""a utopian costume drama set in the near future written in the recent past"", is due to be performed in full in the city on Thursday. The event will finish on Friday with a ""Graduation Ball"" headlined by a hitherto unknown artist named Badger Kull, who is billed as having just one three-minute song, titled Toxteth Day of the Dead. The KLF - who also went by names including The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu, The K Foundation and The Timelords - had hits like 3AM Eternal, Last Train to Trancentral and What Time Is Love? in the late 1980s and early '90s. As well as their electrifying pop-trance hits, Cauty and Drummond became known for sabotaging their own success and subverting the music business in a serious of infamous stunts. Here are four of them: They went to number one in 1988 as The Timelords The duo were ordered to destroy all copies of their 1987 debut album after a complaint from Abba, who objected to the unauthorised sampling of Dancing Queen. Cauty and Drummond travelled to Sweden to try to track Abba down in person. But they failed, so they presented the gold disc they had brought with them to a Swedish prostitute instead. As you do. They burned some of the LPs in a field before throwing the rest overboard from the ferry on the way home. The album was eventually released with large stretches of silence where the samples had been. After getting to number one as The Timelords with Doctor Who theme rip-off Doctorin' the Tardis (fronted by Gary Glitter), they published a book called The Manual (How To Have A Number One The Easy Way) with instructions about how to top the charts. Austrian Eurotrash band Edelweiss followed their advice and sold five million records. When The KLF won best British group at the 1992 Brit Awards, they made their disdain for the music industry clear by performing 3AM Eternal with death metal group Extreme Noise Terror. The appearance ended with Drummond firing blanks from a machine gun into the stunned audience before an announcer said: ""The KLF have left the music business."" Not satisfied with that, they dumped a dead sheep on the steps of the after-show party with a note reading ""I died for you"", and deleted their back catalogue. After their resignation from the music industry, they rejected everything that had gone before in the most extreme way in 1994 - taking the Â£1m they had left in royalties to the island of Jura and burning bundles of Â£50 notes. That led to howls of protests from those who said it should have gone to a worthy cause. Despite saying they wouldn't talk about it, they actually have.

Duke to attend first event since retiring,"Prince Philip attended his last solo engagement, held at Buckingham Palace, on 2 August The Duke of Edinburgh has chosen the opening of a bridge to make his first official appearance alongside the Queen since retiring from solo engagements. Prince Philipcarried out his final solo engagementon 2 August, when he attended a parade to mark a fundraising challenge by the Royal Marines. Buckingham Palace said the 96-year-old would join the Queen to open the Queensferry Crossing on 4 September. Officials have said the duke's decision to retire was not medically related. The 1.7-mile long Queensferry Crossing, costing Â£1.35bn, will replace the Forth Road Bridge as the main road route between Edinburgh and Fife. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon will also attend the event, while there will be a blessing by the Moderator of the Church of Scotland. The Queensferry Crossing will replace the Forth Road Bridge for most traffic Prince Philipannounced his retirement in May,after decades of supporting the Queen, as well as attending events for his own charities and organisations. A spokesman at the time said he ""may still choose to attend certain public events from time to time"". Decades of royal duty When he retired, the duke had carried out 22,219 solo engagements since 1952. He had made 637 solo overseas visits, including 229 visits to 67 Commonwealth countries, and 408 visits to 76 other countries.

Should we ban nuts in public places?,"Nuts are an on-the-go snacking staple, yet they are also potentially deadly to a small fraction of the UK population. So is it time to crack down on eating nuts in public and if so, where should we start? About two million people in the UK have a food allergy, with fish, shellfish and nuts among the most common types. For most people, the symptoms are mild - such as an itchy mouth or a rash - but in extreme cases, it can result in difficulty breathing or a potentially fatal anaphylactic shock. More than 25,000 people were admitted to hospital in England for allergies between 2015 and 2016 - a third higher than four years earlier - and the number of people treated for anaphylactic shock is also on the rise. So as the family of one young woman, Amy May Shead,who was left severely brain damaged after a reaction to nuts, campaign to have them banned on planes, is it time to take action? Becky Gittins, 22, is about to start her first full-time job as an accountant and says she is already nervous about her first day. Becky, a Warwick University graduate, also has a severe peanut allergy which can provoke anaphylaxis - a life-threatening allergic reaction. ""My manager asked me about it this week, and I said I'd bring my own lunch, but she told me she had the same allergy and they do her a box of salad separately. ""That makes me much more reassured about that first day."" But she says work events ""make me quite anxious"", adding: ""There's nothing worse than those dinners when they ask, 'Why have the serving staff spoken to you?' and the whole table for an hour is talking about it."" She adds: ""I noticed the office eats Hersheys Kisses which I think have nuts in them, so I'm going to have to be quite careful."" Employers have a duty under health and safety law to protect your health, including allergies, but only as far as they ""reasonably can"". Supporters of a nut ban on flights argue allergy sufferers are at risk from airborne peanut particles - recirculated around the aircraft - and far from medical help in the event of emergency. However, most major airlines cannot guarantee a nut-free flight. Some - including EasyJet and Virgin Atlantic - say cabin crew can make an announcement if a passenger asks them to beforehand. Vanessa James, a nut-allergic investment banker who travels for work, says flying has become ""more difficult"". Now 37, she has lived with the allergy for nearly two decades and suffered six anaphylactic shocks. ""These days they won't make those announcements, and if they serve peanuts they won't not serve them that day."" But a total nut ban is ""impractical"" to enforce, says Amena Warner, head of clinical services at charity Allergy UK. ""Even if the airline did not carry or serve nuts, it would be virtually impossible for them to check whether their passengers have brought nut products with them onto a flight,"" she says. Amena added that if someone ate nuts earlier in the day, then boarded the plane, there could still be a contamination risk. So should we avoid eating peanuts on all forms of transport? Many trains sell nuts on board and passengers may have already brought their own snacks. TransPennine Express, for example, said it sells nuts and would not offer an allergen-free carriage, while Virgin Express said it could not control what foods customers bring on board. Becky says: ""I'm constantly having to get up and move on trains if someone opens a bag of peanuts and my lips begin to tingle. ""I think it's really irresponsible for train stations and airports to actively sell nuts,"" she adds. She thinks people are generally understanding if she asks them to stop eating nuts. ""I do feel like a massive square. Usually, I keep another snack in my bag just in case - they could be a diabetic,"" she says. Vanessa adds: ""I'll normally just move carriage, to be honest, it's not their fault they're sitting next to someone with an allergy."" She says everyday situations can be just as dangerous. ""Five years ago a friend kissed me on the cheek, and she'd been eating a Snickers - when it kicked in I went into anaphylactic shock."" About one in 50 primary school-age children is affected by a peanut allergy, which has prompted some schools to ban peanuts and other foods in the canteen, staff room and playground. A primary school in South Wales recentlyimplemented a ""no chocolate policy""because of one boy's allergy, telling parents: ""All areas of the school will be chocolate-free."" And while schools have been known to ban some foods for health reasons -such as fruit juices- another school prohibitedbirthday cakesin case any of the ingredients contain allergens. But Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, says a no-nut school or nursery ""would not reflect the reality of the outside world"". He says: ""It would be difficult, if not impossible, to enforce a total ban on certain foods in school."" He suggests a ""whole school awareness"" approach instead, where staff and pupils know how to deal with allergic reactions. So maybe it is up to snackers themselves - rather than organisations - to think twice before opening a packet of peanuts in public.

Trump softens tone to urge 'a new unity',"This video can not be played One came to applaud Trump, the other to boo US President Donald Trump has called for a ""new unity"", a day after a campaign-style rally in which he attacked political foes and media. Speaking in Reno, Nevada, Mr Trump said ""we are one people with one home and one great flag"". ""In America, we never lose faith, we never forget who we are, and we never stop striving for a better future,"" he told the American Legion. Hundreds of protesters gathered outside the convention centre as he spoke. Why Trump's fans stay loyal What Trump's Phoenix rally taught us Trump in threat to shut government Trump hat judge says stunt was joke In a 22-minute address to the veterans' group, Mr Trump read from a teleprompter as he said: ""It is time to heal the wounds that have divided us, and to seek a new unity based on the common values that unite us."" This video can not be played Confederate statues covered in Charlottesville He told his audience of more than 5,000 that in the US, ""we are not defined by the colour of our skin, the figure on our pay cheque, or the party of our politics.

This video can not be played Trump urges 'new unity' a day after raucous rally In his 80-minute speech, Mr Trump threatened to shut down the government unless funding was approved for his proposed wall on the US-Mexico border. He also excoriated media coverage of his statements about violence at a white supremacist march in Charlottesville, Virginia, earlier this month. Mr Trump selectively quoted his initial response, omitting his much-criticised remark that""many sides"" were to blamefor clashes that ended with a counter-demonstrator killed. He also accused the ""damn dishonest media"" of ""trying to take away our culture"". ""They're trying to take away our history,"" he added. As he spoke, protesters clashed with police outside the venue in central Phoenix.

UK to probe impact of overseas students,"The UK does not have a major problem with foreign students abusing the immigration system by remaining in the country illegally, new data suggests. Previous estimates showed a large gap between arrivals and departures of foreign nationals who come to the UK to study. Some suggested this was down to many students staying on illegally at the end of their course. Butthe first data based on proper exit checks,externalsuggests this may not be true. It comes as Home Secretary Amber Rudd launched an investigation into the impact of international students on the UK's society and economy. Big net migration fall since Brexit vote What do the latest migration figures reveal? The review, by the government's Migration Advisory Committee, will look at the effect EU and non-EU students have on the UK labour market while they are in the UK. The old data on overseas students - like all previous UK net migration estimates - were based on the International Passenger Survey (IPS). But officials now have access to exit check data, which records actual behaviour rather than what people leaving the UK tell IPS interviewers at ports and airports about their future plans. When non-EU former students were departing the UK in 2015 and 2016, 28% told the IPS they were unsure how long they would be out of the UK or that they intended to return within 12 months. Exit checks data suggest the proportion of non-EU students who actually returned is much lower at around 6%, meaning there may have been an underestimate of long-term emigration. ""There is no evidence of a major issue of non-EU students overstaying their entitlement to stay,"" the ONS said in its report. The report focused on 1.3 million visas granted to non-European Economic Area nationals which expired in 2016/17, without an extension to stay longer. It showed that out of 181,024 expired student visas, 176,407, or 97.4%, left the country in-time. There were similar proportions for work (95.4%) and visitor (96.7%) visas. This gave an overall percentage of 96.3% of visa holders departing before their leave to be in the country ran out. The ONS report says of the remainder that some may have left but not been identified due to gaps in the data, others will have left late, and some may have overstayed. Labour's shadow home secretary Diane Abbot said the exit check data showed Prime Minister Theresa May's ""long-running campaign to malign international students is based on fantasy, with no evidence of a major issue with students overstaying"". She added: ""Some in government appear to be waking up to the idea that overseas students make a valuable contribution to our country and have belatedly asked the Migration Advisory Committee to gather evidence. ""Labour will offer fair rules and reasonable management of migration; prioritising jobs, growth and prosperity, not bogus net migration targets."" But the Home Office said the exit check report showed its efforts to shut down bogus colleges and curb visa abuses were working. ""There is no limit on the number of genuine international students who can come to study in the UK. ""The exit checks report shows that the measures the government has introduced to crack down on abuse of student routes are working and we now have high levels of compliance. ""At the same time we've maintained a highly competitive offer for those talented international students who want to learn at our top institutions, and the number of sponsored applications to study at our universities have continued to rise."" The new data has led to fresh calls for Mrs May to remove students from her overall net migration target of 100,000. A spokesman for the left-leaning IPPR think tank said: ""If the Home Office continues to rely on this data to inform a restrictive policy on international students, then it is in all likelihood spending valuable government time and resources on a problem that simply does not exist. ""Given this new revealing analysis from exit checks data, the government should now urgently explore ways to remove students from the migration target altogether."" Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable, who fought against curbs on non-EU students when he was business secretary in the coalition government, said: ""As we argued repeatedly with Theresa May, overseas students bring huge economic benefits to universities and the broader economy. ""It makes no sense for students to be included in official immigration statistics."" The in-depth analysis of the impact of international students on the economy will also look at the impact of tuition fees and other spending by foreign students on the national, regional and local economies. It will consider the impact their recruitment has on the quality of education given to domestic students. The committee is due to report back by September next year. Alistair Jarvis, chief executive of Universities UK, said: ""We welcome the government's commitment to a detailed examination of the net benefits of international students. ""This is an opportunity to build on the considerable evidence that shows that international students have a very positive impact on the UK economy and local communities.""

Briton held in Turkey for smuggling coins,"Toby Robyns was stopped as he prepared to board a flight home with his family A British man is facing up to three years in a Turkish prison for trying to take home some ancient coins found on the seabed during a family holiday. Toby Robyns, 52, an ambulance driver from Southwick, in West Sussex, was arrested as he made his way through security at Bodrum airport on Saturday. Airport security staff reportedly found 12 coins, which were later classed as historical artefacts, in his luggage. Mr Robyns told them his children found them while they were swimming. He is reportedly being detained at Milas prison on suspicion of smuggling historical artefacts.

Women-only train carriages a 'crazy idea',"Women's rights groups and Labour colleagues have criticised a shadow minister for saying female-only train carriages should be considered. Chris Williamson said they were an ""idea worth exploring"" to reduce sexual offences and create ""safe spaces"". But Labour's former transport secretary said it was an ""absolutely crazy idea"", while another of the party's MPs said it ""normalised attacks"". Labour leader Jeremy Corbynfloated the policyin 2015, but later dropped it. Mr Williamson, shadow fire minister, highlightedfigures from the British Transport Policeshowing 1,448 sexual offences on trains had been reported in 2016-17, compared with 650 incidents in 2012-13. Does UK need women-only rail carriages? Life in the women-only train carriage Women abused on London transport MP mocked over women-only carriages The MP for Derby Northtold the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire show: ""I'm not saying we should go down this road at all, I'm merely suggesting that we consult on it."" He said it was about being able to offer ""that safe space for people if they wanted it"". While Mr Williamson said better security and more guards were needed to tackle the problem, he agreed there should be a ""push for behaviour change"". Speaking to BBC Radio 5 live, Labour's former Transport Secretary Lord Adonis dismissed the idea, saying women would find it ""grossly insulting"". ""The idea that they would be herded into separate carriages when the point at issue is a very tiny number of men who don't behave properly."" A sign appearing to mock Mr Williamson was posted on his Commons door Countries including Japan, Brazil and Mexico have tested women-only carriages andthe UK has had ladies-only compartmentsbefore. About 100 still existed on services between London and Essex when the decision was made to phase them out altogether in 1977. Several female Labour MPs have been vocal in their criticism of the idea, whilea sign also appeared on the door of Mr Williamson's parliamentary office, apparently mocking the proposal. The printed note said: ""Woman? Sexually harassed at work? How about working on your own floor?"" Walthamstow MP Stella Creasytweeted,external: ""Can we make all carriages safe for all passengers rather than restricting where we can go? ""[It] doesn't keep women safe to restrict their movements - it normalises attacks. We need to be clear they [the attackers] are problem, not women's seating plans."" Jess Phillips, Labour MP for Birmingham Yardley, said the policy was an ""absolutely terrible idea"". Shetweeted,external: ""Also, men should be incredibly annoyed by [the] suggestion they can't control themselves. ""Sexual violence isn't about urges, it's about power.

Royal Mail's new electric vans unveiled,"The new vehicles will be trialled from today Royal Mail is beginning trials in London of nine fully electric vans with ranges of up to 100 miles. The vehicles, which come in various sizes, will distribute post from the central London depot. They were produced by Oxfordshire-based carmaker Arrival, which recently opened a new factory in Banbury. Another batch of 100 electric vans for Royal Mail has also been ordered from Peugeot. Having already been trialled by Royal Mail, these will enter service in December. Arrival says the nine vehicles it has supplied come in sizes of three and a half, six and seven and a half tonnes. The new electric vans - one of the smaller ones is shown here in a digital render - have a range of up to 100 miles Although the current prototype versions of the vans are fitted with wing mirrors, a spokeswoman for Arrival told the BBC they will be removed from the final design - as cameras will be used to monitor traffic to the rear instead. Royal Mail was ""delighted"" to be collaborating with Arrival, said Paul Gatti, Royal Mail Fleet's managing director. ""We will be putting them through their paces over the next several months to see how they cope with the mail collection demands from our larger sites,"" he added. Royal Mail's fleet comprises about 49,000 vehicles in total. ""European postal providers, starting with DHL in Germany, have been taking this approach for a while now,"" said Ananth Srinivasan, a mobility expert with research consultancy Frost & Sullivan. He added that five countries - the UK, Germany, France, Italy and Spain - had the potential to convert significant proportions of their fleets to electric vehicles in the coming years. ""Our research indicates that by 2025 these countries may have 100,000 postal service vehicles going electric between them,"" he told the BBC.

Witnessing Yemen's desperate suffering,"This video can not be played The BBC travels deep into rebel held Yemen, to see starvation caused by war Severe food and medical shortages caused by two years of devastating war are having a major impact on everyday life in Yemen. The BBC's Nawal al-Maghafi travelled across the country to see the effects first hand. Samira ran into the school - now a makeshift cholera treatment clinic - with the desperation of a mother who knew she had little time left to save her child. To get here she had travelled for kilometres on foot, the only means of transport she could afford. I watched as she dashed towards one of the treatment tables, gently laying Orjowan, her 18-month-old baby, across it, and pleading with the doctors to save her. Her eyes spoke not just of her despair, but of visible exhaustion. For Samira, survival these past two years has been a relentless, never-ending battle. Pale and weak, Orjowan looked about half the size of a child her age, with visibly protruding ribs. In order to get this far Samira and her family had to endure, and survive, three of the biggest calamities of this war: displacement, famine and cholera. Like almost three million other Yemenis, Samira and her family are internally displaced persons (IDPs). Their home was hit in an air strike by the Saudi-led multinational coalition that is supporting the government in its war with the rebel Houthi movement. Samira's children, along with nearly half a million others under five years old, were suffering from severe acute malnutrition. Samira was too, which meant she could not breastfeed Orjowan. Instead, all she was able to give her daughter were meagre servings of powdered milk, prepared with water contaminated with the bacteria that causes cholera. As she watched over her child, Samira broke down in tears. ""If there was anything more I could do for her, I would,"" she said. ""Even if I were to ask my brother for help, he can't because he too is desperate."" As she spoke, Orjowan lay on the table, so thin she was barely able to cry. Samira continued to watch her child's frail, pained body, looking utterly helpless. The UN's appeal for $2.9bn in aid for Yemen is only 39% funded Sadly, Samira's case was far from being an isolated story - indeed, it was the first of many I would encounter on my journey across Yemen. Everywhere I went, I saw more people suffering from desperation, grief and defencelessness. In the rebel-controlled north of the country, we visited clinic after clinic, all packed with patients infected with cholera. At one site I met a family of 18, all suffering from the disease. It may sound perverse to say so, but these were - in many ways - the lucky ones; the people who were able to undertake and afford the journey to get treatment. More than 2,000 people are believed to have already died as a result of the cholera outbreak - the largest in the world - and 540,000 others have been infected. Because of the war more than half of all health facilities have closed or are only partially functioning, leaving 15 million people without access to healthcare. Yemen crisis: Who is fighting Whom Yemen conflict: How bad is the humanitarian crisis Yemen conflict: Cholera risk for more than a million children As we ventured further out into the countryside, we reached a village an hour-and-a-half from the nearest medical facility. There we found people in their homes or communal areas, lying on the ground or on beds, all suffering from cholera-like symptoms. I spoke to Abdullah and his sister, Hind, asking them why they had not gone to a hospital. He could barely summon the energy to reply. ""We don't have the money for the transport,"" he explained, matter-of-factly. ""This war has left us with nothing."" While modern Yemen has always been poor, things have never been this bad for its citizens. Two-and-a-half years of war have unleashed what the UN is now officially calling the world's largest humanitarian crisis. Seven million Yemenis are considered severely food insecure. Three-quarters of Yemen's 27 million people depend on some form of humanitarian assistance, though one does not need statistics to know this. Everywhere I went, beggars lined the streets on a scale I had never witnessed in the country before. While driving in Hudaydah I was surprised that tens of beggars approached my window when I stopped at a junction. One of them was an old lady, who fixed me in the eyes through the glass. Three quarters of the population depend on some form of humanitarian assistance As I lowered my car window, she told me: ""This is how desperate they have made us! My sons are now without salaries. Now I'm spending my last days in this world begging to feed them."" With no public sector workers being paid for more than a year, her story is that of millions of Yemenis - from traffic wardens to teachers - reduced to begging to feed themselves and their children. A blockade imposed on Yemen since 2015 by the Saudi-led coalition has reduced the amount of food, aid and fuel allowed into the country to a trickle. The little that does make it in by sea often spends weeks waiting to be offloaded because the cranes at Hudaydah - once Yemen's busiest port - have been bombed beyond use or repair. When new cranes were donated by the US government to the UN's World Food Programme (WFP) last December, they were stopped at sea by the coalition and refused entry. While visiting Hudaydah, I met David Beasley, the WFP's Executive Director, who was conducting an inspection visit. ""Food and aid should be weapons of peace and not used as weapons of war"", he told me, adding ominously: ""If these cranes do not make it in, hundreds of thousands of Yemeni children will die."" In addition to reducing imports, the blockade has made the cost of distribution so high in Yemen that whatever food does make it onto the shelves is too expensive for the vast majority of people. More than 2,000 people have died in the cholera outbreak Even aid agencies are struggling to fund deliveries, because so much must be spent on transportation rather than the supplies themselves. Despite the enormous scale and urgency of the crisis, the UN's aid appeal has reached only 39% of its $2.9bn (Â£2.3bn) target. Meanwhile, Yemen's health ministry says the closure of the airport in the rebel-controlled capital, Sanaa, has led to some 10,000 deaths from treatable illnesses because people cannot travel to receive medical care. The coalition has said the blockade is in place to ensure that no weapons are smuggled into Yemen and denied that it is intentionally targeting civilians in the war. Shortages of food have made many children more vulnerable to cholera Wherever you go in Yemen, shortages of food and medical supplies are on an unimaginable scale. And yet, because of the political realities of the conflict, the country simply does not have the capacity to deal with the humanitarian catastrophe. Of course, this is not to say that the Houthis and their allies are blameless in Yemen's tragedy. They too have been accused by human rights groups of killing civilians and violating the laws of war - charges they have denied. The rebels are also alleged to have impeded the distribution of aid on the ground. Yemen's hospitals are struggling to cope with the crisis I do not know what happened to Samira and Orjowan, as well as Abdullah and Hind and the rest of the people in their village. The tragedy of cholera is that it is both easily treatable, yet fatal within hours if left untreated. What is most heart-breaking about Yemen's humanitarian catastrophe is that it is completely and needlessly man-made. All the suffering we witnessed was completely preventable and could be stopped within days if the political will - by the warring factions and their supporters abroad - was there to do so. In the meantime, as international diplomacy continues to fail Yemenis, their lives will - unimaginably - only get worse.

An âexceptionalâ journalist remembered,"Kim Wall ""never made a spectacle of the characters she reported on"" It is a ""black irony"" that Kim Wall - the journalist whose remains were found off Denmark - died while working in such a familiar and seemingly safe area, say friends and family. The 30-year-old freelance reporter had travelled the world in pursuit of her stories - from Uganda to Cuba to the Marshall Islands to Kenya to New York City. At one point she even ""slipped into"" North Korea. She specialised in stories about identity, gender or subcultures, often with social justice themes. ""Kim has worked as a journalist in many dangerous places, and we have often been worried about her,"" her parents wrote ina letter to Danish TV,externalwhile she was still missing. ""That something could happen to her in Copenhagen, just a few kilometres from the childhood home, we could not imagine at all."" Who is DIY submariner Peter Madsen? Inventor says toxic fumes killed Kim Wall What we know Ms Wall was a formidable character and driven journalist, those who knew her say. She was born in 1987 and grew up in a close-knit community in the small town of Trelleborg in southern Sweden, just across the strait dividing Denmark from Sweden. This video can not be played Kim Wall's death - what we know so far She studied international relations at London School of Economics and went on to gain a place on the rigorous masters programme of Columbia University's School of Journalism - described as the ""Oxbridge of journalism"". Even within her cohort she was top of the class, winning honours in her year, her classmate and friend Anna Codrea-Rado told the BBC. ""What made her journalistic abilities so exceptional was that she looked for quirky stories but with a bigger narrative,"" she said. ""She reported them deeply - she never made a spectacle of the characters. Her reporting was rock-solid."" Her interest in people and stories made her a great party guest. ""She was one of the few people that could lift a room just by being in it,"" Ms Wall's friend Christopher Harress (left) told the BBC ""She was very bubbly and warm, the kind of person who had fantastic stories about the things she was working on - you could jump straight past the small talk. ""She was intellectual, so well-travelled and had such varied interests. She was interested in quirky and eccentric stories. If you were at a party you'd end up passing hours just chatting to her."" This admiration has been echoed by numerous friends. Ms Wall wrote ""about subcultures, about a globalised world in rapid change"", says Victoria Grevein Sweden's Expressen newspaper,external. ""About life in a huge shopping centre in Kampala's Chinatown, about Cuba's underground internet providers who download and disseminate new episodes of Keeping Up with the Kardashians to people from all walks of life in Havana. We made a report together about the wealthy women in New York who voted for Donald Trump."" The weekly package - How Cubans deliver culture without internet (Harpers),external Fairy Tale Romances, Real and Staged (The New York Times),external Naked in an island idyll: eccentric couple recall a life of rockets and dictators (Guardian),external The Magic Kingdom meets the Middle Kingdom in Shanghai Disneyland (Time),external But Ms Greve and others also highlight the effort and pluck needed to succeed at this genre of journalism in today's media. ""As news organisations grapple with shrinking budgets, they increasingly rely on freelancers, who cost less and are often willing to take on the attendant risks reporting in places they wouldn't send their staff to,"" writes Sruthi Gottipatiin the Guardian,external. ""Even against this backdrop, the competition is fierce to place stories and female freelancers work hard to ensure their gender isn't calculated as a liability. So they clam up about the dangers they face and sometimes report before being commissioned to do so."" Madsen and Ms Wall were photographed just before departing on 10 August This pressure to secure good material before there is even a formal commission could explain why no news organisation has confirmed it gave Ms Wall the assignment she died carrying out. A friend and fellow freelance journalist,May Jeong, wrote that US technology magazine Wired had been in touch with Ms Wall,externalabout Peter Madsen's do-it-yourself rocket and submarine projects. Ms Wall was staying in Copenhagen with her partner, Danish designer Ole Stobbe, when she began investigating the old harbour workshops where Madsen and other enthusiasts had built the submarine UC3 Nautilus. On 10 August 2017, she boarded the submarine to interview him and was never seen again - her mutilated body was found by a cyclist 11 days later. In April 2018 Madsen was convicted of murder and now faces life in jail. Kim Wall's grieving parents Ingrid and Joachim May Jeong said Ms Wall was used to being in ""uncomfortable"" situations as a reporter, and ""in stepping onto that submarine, Kim was doing what any reporter onto a good story would have done"". Friends and family have urged the world not to let the nature of her death overshadow her life. ""Please don't remember her as the murdered Swedish journalist who died in a grisly horror straight out of a crime drama,"" Ms Codrea-Radosaid on Twitter,external. ""Remember her work."" This month the Swedish Publicists' Association gave a posthumous 10,000-krona (Â£843; $1,177) scholarship to Ms Wall. Her parents Joachim and Ingrid donated it tothe Kim Wall Memorial Fund,external, which will award it ""to a young female journalist who wants to work in Kim's spirit"", the family said.

Galaxy Note 8: Samsung's phoenix phone?,"This video can not be played Samsung's Galaxy Note 8 is one of the biggest handsets to date It was the most disastrous product recall in the history of the mobile phone industry. Now, a year on from the exploding Galaxy Note 7 fiasco, Samsung has unveiled the new version of its giant smartphone. It should be a nervous moment for a company which has had what sounds like a catastrophic year. First, the self-combusting handsets did untold damage to Samsung's brand, then the arrest of the company's boss on corruption charges battered its reputation further. But here's a funny thing - the Korean company can afford to be pretty relaxed about the Note 8. Because even before the phone goes on sale, the company's record results and soaring share price show that the crises of the past year have done little damage to its bottom line. What is more, the prospects for the Note 8 look rosy. The new version features the biggest screen of any mainstream phone, along with new multi-tasking capabilities, and a dual lens rear camera with optical image stabilisation. The S Pen stylus that comes with the Note, and is seen by Samsung as a key draw, has also been upgraded so that you can produce fine writing even if the screen is wet. The S Pen can now be used to easily create animated Gifs The original Note, launched in 2011, started the trend for larger screens. I remember trying it out on a street in Barcelona and feeling foolish holding this enormous slab to my ear. ""What is that?"" exclaimed a passer-by whom I had stopped to ask for directions. But today, with so many other giant phones on the market, the Note 8 does not look or feel outlandish - indeed one problem for Samsung may be making it stand out from the crowd. It is also one of the more expensive smartphones on the market at an eye-popping Â£869 in the UK. It does however have a fiercely loyal army of fans, who have now waited two years for a new device. You might have thought that the fact that the Note 7 became so notorious that airline pilots warned customers not to bring one on board would have lessened their devotion. But Samsung Europe's Phil Lander says a survey of users tells a different story: ""They're very loyal - eight out of 10 respondents said the word 'love' in association with their smartphone. Three out of four said it was the best smartphone they'd ever had."" The Note 8 allows users to control the depth-of-field of the photos they take Ben Wood, who analyses the mobile phone industry for CCS Insight, is not surprised that Samsung has weathered the storm over the exploding Note. But he is impressed by the sheer stubbornness the company has shown in relaunching the phone. ""You have to admire their grit and determination,"" he says. ""I thought the Samsung brand would recover but the Note brand was more open to question."" He says the buzz around the new Note is good, with reports of plenty of pent-up demand, A successful debut will mean that, with the Galaxy S8 and S8+, Samsung once again dominates the market in high-end Android phones. The company has also been eager to make plenty of noise about the Note before Apple's latest iPhone, expected in September, grabs all the attention. Samsung believes that it has consistently introduced new innovations, from bigger screens to better cameras, before its rival, and may hope that some Apple users will be lured away. Ben Wood is sceptical: ""It's proved just about impossible to lever iPhones out of their users' hands."" That leaves things back where they have been for much of the past decade, with two companies dominating the mobile market. ""It's a two-horse race outside China,"" Mr Wood adds. The past week has seen launches from the reborn Nokia, and from Android founder Andy Rubin's new Essential phone business. But neither looks likely to win a fraction of the sales - or profits - that Samsung will get from the Note 8. Unlike the iPhone 7, Samsung has opted to retain a traditional headphone socket on its new handset The drama is not over for Samsung. On Friday, its former boss Lee Jae-yong is in court again, with prosecutors seeking a 12-year jail sentence for his alleged role in a bribery scandal. But if its rivals hoped the company would take its eye off the ball, they have been disappointed. Samsung sails on, its course unaltered by the squalls of the past year.

Reality Check: What is the European Court of Justice?,"European Court of Justice headquarters, Luxembourg The UK government has published a ""future partnership paper"" as it works towards ending the direct jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in the United Kingdom after Brexit. So what does the ECJ do, and why is it so important to the Brexit process? The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is actually composed of two separate courts - the Court of Justice and the General Court. From 2004 to 2016 there was a third court, the Civil Service Tribunal, but its work is now done by the General Court. To avoid confusion this article will refer to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) to describe the work of the entire institution. If you want to know more detail, or look up a specific case, you can do sohere.,external The European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR), which is a separate institution. The ECtHR is based in a different city, Strasbourg, and is not part of the European Union. It is the ECtHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ has tended to support British efforts to extend the remit of the single market. The European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg - NOT the ECJ It decides whether the institutions of the EU are acting legally, and it settles disputes between them. It ensures that the member states of the EU are complying with their legal obligations as set out in the EU treaties; and it allows member states to challenge EU legislation. It interprets EU law at the request of national courts. Taken all together, this means that the ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, and pretty much everything else that the EU does. It all comes back to that Brexit referendum slogan ""Take Back Control"". At the Conservative Party conference in October 2016, Theresa May, as the new prime minister, declared: ""We are not leaving (the EU) only to return to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. That is not going to happen."" Vague promises to take back control of our laws suddenly became a very specific promise to end the jurisdiction of the ECJ in the UK. It became a government red line. Theresa May highlighted ECJ membership as an issue for Brexit at the 2016 Conservative Party conference Yes, we can. That's because trade deals usually have their own inbuilt dispute procedures. But any company from the US or Japan or anywhere else that wants to sell its product in the European single market has to comply with all EU regulations, and with all ECJ rulings about any of those regulations. If foreign companies don't comply, they can't operate in the EU. The same applies in reverse, of course, to European companies that want to sell their products elsewhere. Not if they want to operate in the single market, no. They are not immune from EU law. Quite the opposite, in fact. Take Google for example, which was fined a record 2.4bn euro by the European Commission in June for abusing its dominance of the search engine market. If Google wanted to appeal, it would have to make its case before the European Court of Justice. Google's office in the Netherlands: The company was fined 2.4bn euro by the ECJ In that sense, no, not directly, because companies can choose whether they want to trade abroad or not. But the really difficult issue for any country that wants to ""leave"" ECJ jurisdiction entirely is that the European Court is the ultimate arbiter for all the rules and regulations that make the EU tick. So if the UK wants to stay in the European Air Safety Agency, or the European Arrest Warrant, or the European Medicines Agency or any number of other bodies that regulate various aspects of our lives, it will have to accept that the ECJ will have a role to play in UK affairs. Air traffic control - one of many activities affected by the ECJ Here's one illustration of how thin this red line can be. Since the referendum, the government has confirmed that it still intends to join a new Unified Patent Court that is being set up by EU member states, even though the new court will regard ECJ decisions as legally binding and refer its own legal questions to the ECJ. Yes, that's right. Every time you dig beneath the surface of Brexit you stumble across the European Court of Justice. To get rid of it entirely would mean cutting all the ties we have, setting up dozens of regulatory bodies of our own, and starting many things from scratch. Also, don't forget, if the UK wants to negotiate a period of transition, to smooth the path towards full exit from the EU, it will have to accept that the writ of the ECJ will continue to run for quite some time after Brexit. That's another policy area in which the role of the ECJ will have to be negotiated. The EU insists that its citizens in the UK should continue to enjoy the legal protection of the ECJ even after Brexit. UK negotiators say that is not acceptable, partly because it is a commitment that would have to last for many decades in some cases. People on both sides of the Channel hope it is, at least in some respects. On the citizens' rights issue, for example, there are suggestions that some kind of independent tribunal, involving both EU and UK judges, could be set up. There are some precedents for this. Similarly when it comes to the single market there are parallel structures such as the EFTA Court (which governs the affairs of Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, the three non-EU members of the European Economic Area) that are nominally independent of the ECJ. But in practice, the EFTA Court follows ECJ rulings extremely closely. The UK could in theory set up something similar. The EU may be ready to live with that, but ardent Brexiteers will raise objections. That's one of the reasons why David Davis has spoken of a 'new and unique solution' - he has to try to keep everyone happy! The trouble is that legal issues such as jurisdiction are extremely difficult to fudge, and there does appear to be a substantial gap in perception between the two sides. Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union David Davis (left) and EU Chief Brexit Negotiator Michel Barnier David Davis has made the sporting argument that if you're Manchester United and you go to play Real Madrid, you don't let Madrid nominate the referee. But the EU sees the footballing metaphor rather differently: the UK is choosing to leave a league of 28 teams. If it wants to come back to play the odd friendly, the EU would argue, it has to accept that the panel of referees will remain the same.

The most popular hashtags,"Before Twitter came along, no-one really knew what the point of the hash key was on the keyboard (except for maybe computer programmers). The social media network transformed its use, making it a way to tag tweets and the hashtag became a thing. Ten years on, the # symbol is used 125 million times on the platform each day. Here are some of the biggest hashtags ever, mentioning big events, controversies and creating Twitter moments in the process. Black Lives Matter is an international movement that first mobilised on Twitter, bringing people together to work towards creating a fairer society for black people. BLM now has an online forum and charity, which it says is ""intended to build connections between black people and our allies to fight anti-black racism, to spark dialogue among black people, and to facilitate the types of connections necessary to encourage social action and engagement"". Ed Balls' tweet received more than 95,000 retweets.,external Politicians don't have the best reputation when it comes to using Twitter, despiteEd Miliband's best efforts,externalto try to change all that. Since 28 April 2011, the world has celebrated former Labour MP Ed Balls' Twitter fail, when he simply tweeted his own name. People obviously still find it funny, which is probably why it has its own anniversary every year. Is it blue and black? Is it white and gold? Two years on, the debate still rumbles on. It all started over this photo of a dress and the world couldn't agree on the colour of it. It actually turned in toa huge scientific experiment,externalabout how humans see colour. But at the time it made you delete half your Facebook friends list and ignore every family member that didn't agree with you. Emma Watson's tweets to launch the campaign encouraged people to look beyond gender stereotypes.,external HeForShe is a United Nations Women's campaign for gender equality, which started in 2014 and is backed by the likes of Emma Watson and Simon Pegg. The campaign aims to inspire men to understand and end inequalities experienced by women and show how gender equality affects people in all social, economic and political situations. People used the hashtag as a platform to express their own battles with gender inequality in everyday life and campaign for change. Graeme Swann got involved with the hashtag after hearing about Philip Hughes' death.,external Twenty-five-year-old Australian cricketer Phillip Hughes' sudden death in 2014 shocked fans around the world and triggered tribute messages on Twitter using the hashtag #PutYourBatsOut. It all started when fan Paul Taylor put a cricket bat outside his house as a mark of respect. It then started trending on Twitter, with current and former cricket stars, celebrities and fans from around the world also putting out their bats as tribute.

The perfume scents that could be lost forever," A visitor to Kannauj could easily miss the signs of what was once the city’s main industry. But among the cars, lorries and street vendors, just occasionally a cart passes by laden with flower baskets, and turns through a large gate into the stone-paved alleyways of the old city. Kannauj, Uttar Pradesh, India Twenty years ago there were 700 perfume distilleries in Kannauj. Today there are fewer than 100. The distilleries produce oil-based perfumes, or attars, from flowers such as rose, jasmine and henna through a process of steam distillation. What makes them unique is the intensity of their scent, but also the time and resources needed to make them.It takes four tonnes of hand-picked roses to make just 1kg of rose attar. Before sunrise, the flowers of the Damask rose are picked by hand from thorny bushes, and sent to the distilleries to be used the same day. There they are tipped into large copper pots, or dhegs, with a small amount of cold water. Under the pot, a fire is made with wood or dung, and the water is boiled for four to six hours. The hot steam releases the essential oils of the flower, which condense and flow down bamboo pipes to a receiver pot. The perfumer's job is a complex one. If the dheg overheats, the resulting scent will be too smoky. Judging how long to heat the dheg is also critical. These skills have been passed down from father to son for generations. But according to Vev Bhav Pathak, the young manager of the Muna Lal and Sons distillery, demand for attars is in decline. Attars are not cost-effective products. They’re expensive to make and few people understand this. Even fewer appreciate their value.” One reason for the high price is the increasing scarcity of sandalwood. Sandalwood oil can be used as a perfume by itself, but it is also traditionally mixed with the rose oil that emerges from the dheg’s bamboo pipe. Deforestation, though, has prompted the Indian government to ban the felling of sandalwood trees, and the wood has become “practically unaffordable”, says Pathak. Muna Lal and Sons, like most of its competitors, now uses cheaper paraffin-based products as the base for its attars, but these alter the scent and are less appealing to customers who knew and loved the authentic sandalwood version. This is made by distilling the rose oil a number of times to increase its concentration and consists entirely of the essential oil extracted from the flower, unmixed with any other substances. The emperor Jahangir (1569-1627) wrote in his autobiographical work, Tuzuki Jahangiri, that there is ""no other scent of equal excellence… It lifts the spirit and refreshes the soul."" Painting of Jahangir To produce 1kg of ruh gulab requires almost double the amount of rose flowers - eight tonnes. At Muna Lal and Sons the wholesale price of that 1kg is $18,000. In India, there are some wealthy customers who still buy attars and ruh al gulab. But Kannauj's biggest domestic client is now the chewing tobacco industry. Pure rose oil is a natural product that is safe to consume by mouth, and a tiny drop is sufficient to flavour a large quantity of tobacco. Outside India, one of the biggest markets is in the Middle East, where dheg-produced attars have long been highly valued, and there are plenty of customers who can afford to buy them.In 2014, fragrance sales in Saudi Arabia were valued at $1.4bn; an average Saudi consumer was estimated to spend $700 per month on attars alone. ""It smells like you have walked into a garden of roses, or that fresh smell you get when you've walked past a bouquet of fresh flowers,"" says Hussah al-Tamimi, a Kuwaiti woman in her early thirties, describing ruh al gulab. ""It has to be subtle, and it has to smell natural."" One reason attars are valued by Muslims - both in India and the Middle East - is that they are made entirely from natural substances that can be applied directly to the body, without the addition of alcohol. In this respect they differ from modern scents that are mixed with solvents and sprayed through an atomiser. In the Gulf region attars increase in value the older they are. As a result, they have historically been offered as presents to brides at their wedding, along with incense and gold, in a wooden chest called adezza. ""When my father wanted to ask for my mother's hand in marriage, he travelled to India to find her the most valuable perfumes for her dezza,"" says 31-year-old Dalal al Sane, also from Kuwait City. “Some of those perfumes she still has today, and hopes to give them to her children when they get married.” But men also wear perfume. In fact rose oil has traditionally been considered a masculine scent in the Gulf and has only recently begun to be worn by women too. ""My father applies rose attar on his hands, when he greets family at home - specifically between his thumb and index-finger, so that it leaves a nice scent on the hands of others when he shakes their hands,"" al Sane says. Although Arabian merchants have traded incense for spice and perfume for centuries, it was in the early 1900s that the trade first took off in Kuwait. The first shop in the souq in Kuwait city dedicated entirely to perfumes, Atyab Al Marshoud, was opened by Sulaiman al Marshoud in 1925, who traveled regularly on dhows to India with his father. It’s now Sulaiman’s son, Waleed, who runs the shop, and continues to maintain the links established by his grandfather with Indian distillers. Today, perfume shops have flooded the souq. Rose attars from Bulgaria and Turkey are highly esteemed, but the ruh al gulab from Kannauj is recognised as something unique - atola(an ancient measure equivalent to about 11.5g) sells for roughly 200 Kuwaiti dinars ($650, £520) at Atyab Al Marshoud. Perfume shop in Dubai But as a luxury product expected to be of the purest quality, some consumers are willing to pay this price. ""The more difficult it is to obtain it, the more valuable the perfume is,"" says Waleed Al Marshoud. How long Kannauj will be able to continue supplying traditional attars and ruh gulab, though, is unclear. ""Demand for dheg-based perfumes is next to nothing today,"" says Pushpraj Jain, owner of the Pragmati Aroma Distillery. ""Today's generation is only interested in modern perfumes, and I have to innovate to make sure I can meet their demands."" While he continues running the dhegs in his distillery, alongside new perfume plants, unease about the future of attars is widespread in Kannauj. Ousman a perfumer at Muna Lal and Sons distillery, has no doubt about the superiority of the product he makes. “The difference between a synthetic perfume and a natural one is like the difference between food cooked in a microwave and food cooked in a wood-fired oven,” he says. And yet he fears the industry is slowly dying. He persuaded his children to take up a different trade - one that would pay more than his, and allow them to live in greater comfort.

The Bollywood epic filming in Yorkshire,"Akshay Kumar, one of Bollywood's biggest stars, has been filming in Britain Bradford, Doncaster and Rotherham are providing the backdrop for a major Bollywood film starring one of India's biggest names - just one of the foreign productions contributing to Britain's film-making boom. Anyone who happened to peer through the railings of Doncaster Racecourse last week would have been met with a surreal sight. India's 1936 Olympic hockey team were greeted by a cheering crowd as they climbed off a vintage coach, before Nazi officers viciously beat a couple of their overenthusiastic fans. Behind them, giant swastika banners were draped from the racecourse's historic Clock Tower Stand. But this was just a film set, and Doncaster Racecourse was doubling as Berlin's 1936 Olympic Stadium. It will appear in Gold, an epic new Bollywood movie that tells the story of India's Olympic hockey players in 1936 and 1948. One of the actors in Doncaster was Bollywood superstar Akshay Kumar, who is above the likes of Tom Hanks, Ryan Gosling and Ryan Reynolds onForbes magazine's latest list,externalof the world's best-paid actors. Suhail Al Belushi, from Leeds, is appearing in the film as an extra ""I rank him in the top five actors in Bollywood,"" says Suhail Al Belushi, from Leeds, who is one of more than 5,000 local extras in the film. Mr Al Belushi has taken time out of his day job as a freelance interpreter to appear in the film after seeing Akshay Kumar walk into a hotel in Leeds. ""When I saw him I was shocked,"" he says. ""I thought maybe there's a guy who looks like him. If it was India there would be crowds everywhere, heckling him, following him, wanting photos."" Among the other locations being used, Bradford's Midland Hotel, Harrogate's Old Swan Hotel and Leicester's Grand Hotel are all standing in for different parts of the Bombay Club in colonial Mumbai. Rotherham FC's old Millmoor stadium doubles as an Indian hockey pitch. Dalton Mills in Keighley is a German army camp. The homes of Bradford Bulls, Leeds Rhinos and York City FC have all had a sprinkle of Bollywood stardust. Doncaster Racecourse does a good impression of Berlin's 1936 Olympic Stadium ""I came here because I liked the locations,"" director Reema Kagti says. ""For this film, because it's a period film, I needed architecture that's been maintained. Architecture that existed before the '30s and has been maintained till date, and Yorkshire seems to have a lot of that. They really seem to respect their heritage and look after it."" The UK has become the destination of choice for many global film-makers, with talent from both Hollywood and Bollywood making it their home from home. Movie production in the UK has grown 72% since 2014, the Office for National Statistics has reported. Last year, Â£1.3bn was spent by foreign film-makers in Britain, according to the British Film Institute (BFI) - double the figure in 2012. Most of that came from Hollywood blockbusters like Star Wars: The Last Jedi, Transformers: The Last Knight and The Mummy. But there's a growing trend for Bollywood films to be shot in the UK too. The 2007 film Salaam-e-Ishq was partly shot in Oxford Source: BFI There are a few reasons behind Britain's allure for overseas film-makers - tax breaks, the weak pound making it cheaper to film here, a readily available pool of skilled crew, plus the historic locations. There are other attractions, too, for Reema Kagti. She has developed a taste for local beers. ""If I do get any time out, I do go to a pub and drink some ale,"" she smiles. Sue Bellarby has worked on 26 Bollywood film sets in the UK, including Gold, where she is unit manager. ""When I started in 2005 there was maybe one a year,"" she says. ""Now we're getting five or six. ""There are three shooting in the north at the moment. There are another two coming in September/October."" Members of the Gold costume department on location in Doncaster In the past, Bollywood film-makers might have recreated British castles or stately homes in state-of-the-art studios in India - but now they are increasingly using the real thing, she says. ""They love the authenticity of shooting here. And I know they get some form of tax incentive. My experience of them is it's as cheap to film here as it is in India now, and they can actually film the locations for real."" And they are increasingly going outside London. Yorkshire and Humber had the fastest-growing film and TV industries in the country between 2009-15,according to Screen Yorkshire,external, an agency that has been crucial to the area's success. India beat Germany 8-1 in the 1936 Olympic hockey final Gold's location manager Martin Walker says it is becoming more difficult and expensive to film in London. ""The costs are becoming prohibitive,"" he says. ""Unit bases - spaces big enough to get all your big facilities and trucks in - are becoming fewer and fewer as they get developed on or sold out from underneath us, and some of us London-based location managers do worry about how viable London will be in the future as a place to shoot if you cannot physically service your shoot by having your vehicles close by."" Getting out of London has other advantages. ""You've got your hotel costs which are half price, you've got great transport links, and you've actually got a population who still finds filming interesting and fun and fascinating and are helpful,"" he explains. ""Unfortunately London has gone the other way. 'Oh, filming again? Right, Â£50 before I move my car.'"" Gold location manager Martin Walker in front of the set in Doncaster Kate Smith, a Manchester-based hair and make-up artist, adds: ""It is definitely becoming a lot busier up north - the north west, Wales, Yorkshire. ""It used to be at one time that you'd have to live in London to be able to get the work, and you'd move the crew to wherever it was going. But now, the Isle of Man, Ireland, Scotland - it's all booming everywhere."" Bradford - which became the first Unesco City of Film in 2009 - has been the Gold production team's base as well as providing a number of filming locations. Gold is being directed by Reema Kagti David Wilson, director of Bradford City of Film, says more than 100 films and TV shows have been shot in the city in the last 12 months. That's double the number in 2012, when he reopened the city's film office. ""It's given the city a renewed confidence,"" he says. ""The phone in the film office rings off the walls some days. Every week there's a significant enquiry. ""Sometimes they don't come to fruition but more often than not they do, and we've now gained a reputation as a film-friendly city, and we're reaping the rewards of that."" The money spent on crew and suppliers - from trucks to catering - all makes its way into the local and national economy. And after release, locations often see an increase in tourism, Mr Wilson says. ""You've got the initial production phase, but that also leads to people thinking, do you know what, we might go there. We might go to Yorkshire. It looked brilliant in that film. And so it does dovetail very much into that whole tourism offer."" So perhaps, a year from now, when Gold is released, there could be another surreal sight at Doncaster Racecourse if Indian movie fans are climbing off coaches to see where the movie was shot. Gold will be released on 15 August 2018. Follow us onFacebook,external, on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external, or on Instagram atbbcnewsents,external.

Total Chinese imports from North Korea are also down, dropping by almost a third compared with the previous year.

The UK's financial sector will propose a ""mutual access"" trade pact between the UK and the European Union that would allow banks and other firms to continue doing cross-border business after Brexit, according to a draft report seen by Reuters. Unless Britain negotiates new trading relations with the EU, banks, insurers and fund managers in Britain could be locked out of the bloc's markets. The International Regulatory Strategy Group - sponsored by the City of London Corporation and financial lobby group TheCityUK - says in a draft report that a trade pact would allow cross-border business to continue after Britain leaves the EU. ""The proposals in the report are intended to achieve a level of mutual access for EU and UK firms, which is as close as possible to the current levels of access that exist for such firms within the EU framework,"" the report said. One possible stumbling block, however: no such trade pact in financial services has been tried before. More on the Galaxy Note 8 launch now ...

EU citizen detention letters sent in error,"Dr Eva Johanna Holmberg said the incident made her ""even less likely"" to trust politicians in the wake of Brexit The Home Office sent about 100 letters ""in error"" to EU citizens living in the UK, telling them they had to leave or be liable for ""detention"". The mistake emerged after a Finnish academic, who has the right to live in the UK, received one of the letters. Dr Eva Johanna Holmberg, who is married to a British citizen, said she ""couldn't believe my eyes"" when it told her she had a month to get out. The Home Office said the rights of EU nationals in the UK ""remain unchanged"". Prime Minister Theresa May called it an ""unfortunate mistake"". Dr Holmberg, who works at London's Queen Mary University, had originally applied for a ""qualified person certificate"" before receiving the letter. These certificates - for citizens from the European Economic Area or Swiss nationals - confirm the right to live in the UK for those who meet certain criteria. The historian said the ""absurd nonsense"" had made her ""even less likely"" to trust politicians in the wake of Brexit. ""When I opened this, I could not believe my eyes seeing words like 'a decision has been taken to remove you from the United Kingdom',"" she told the BBC. The letter said she was facing detention unless she left the UK with one month, she added. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The academic spent the next few days contacting a lawyer, her employer, and attempting to speak to the Home Office. On Wednesday, the Home Office contacted her personally to apologise - six days after she first opened the letter. She said a ""Twitter storm"" had been created after her story first emerged in a newspaper in Finland. ""I have been in contact with numerous people on Twitter, on email and on Facebook,"" she said. ""I am yet to go through all of those messages but I have seen other people reporting similar experiences."" Prof Simon Gaskell, Principal of Queen Mary University, said it is vital the UK government makes clear it understands ""the huge contribution"" overseas academics make. ""Dr Holmberg and her family should not have been subject to such stress, and it should not have been necessary for support mechanisms at Queen Mary University of London to be activated,"" he said. The Home Office said everyone who received a letter would be contacted to ""clarify that they can disregard it"". ""A limited number of letters were issued in error and we have been urgently looking into why this happened,"" a spokesperson added. The prime minister said the Home Office had ""moved quickly to contact all the people who had received these letters and to reassure them that they were not going to be deported"". ""I want to reassure all EU nationals here in the United Kingdom that their rights and status here in the UK has not changed,"" Mrs May told the BBC. However, critics have raised concern for the 3.2 million EU citizens living in Britain after the UK leaves the EU. James McGrory, executive director of the pro-EU group Open Britain, said: ""This is shameful stuff from the same department that gave us the disgraceful'go home' vansa few years ago. ""It's little wonder that many EU citizens feel worried about their future status in the UK when they hear of people with every right to be here getting letters threatening their deportation."" Caroline Lucas, co-leader of the Green Party and Dr Holmberg's constituency MP, said the case ""beggars belief"". ""Mistakes like this are simply not good enough. The government is turning lives upside down by callously playing hard ball over Brexit and it needs to take its responsibilities far more seriously,"" she added. Lib Dem home affairs spokesman Ed Davey said the letters were ""appalling"" and ""shame Britain"".

PM: UK leaving EU court's jurisdiction,"This video can not be played Why the fuss about the European Court of Justice? Theresa May has insisted the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in the UK will come to an end with Brexit. As the governmentpublished new details of its position,external, the PM said the UK would ""take back control of our laws"". But critics say it will be impossible to avoid European judges having a role in enforcing new agreements drawn up with the EU. Ministers say the two sides will keep ""half an eye"" on each other's rulings. Reality Check: What is the European Court of Justice? UK seeks 'close co-operation' on legal disputes The ECJ is in charge of ensuring member states abide by EU law. Its rulings are binding on all member states, and it also settles disputes between countries and EU institutions. In its new policy paper, the government: Does not rule out ECJ keeping its jurisdiction during the Brexit transition period that is planned after March 2019 Promises to work with the EU on the ""arrangements for judicial supervision"" during this period Makes clear that the rights of EU citizens living in the UK after Brexit will only be subject to British law - a sticking point in the negotiations with the EU Says giving the ECJ authority over UK-EU disputes would be unprecedented and not ""fair and neutral"" The promise to end ""direct jurisdiction"" in recent policy papers - a phrase not used by Mrs May - has raised questions about what ""indirect"" jurisdiction the EU court could be left with. In the latest publication, about how to enforce disputes after Brexit, the government has outlined several models used by other countries that it says show there is no need for the ECJ to be the final arbiter. But some of these involve the ECJ having an influence on the outcome of disputes, for example by interpreting EU law in a way that binds a disputes panel, or for its past rulings to be taken into account. Today's paper does not pin the government's colours to any particular mast. It throws out a number of possible models for how a trade agreement with the EU would work in terms of resolving disputes. All of the models make it clear that the ECJ will no longer have sole jurisdiction over disputes. The key question is how much influence the ECJ would retain under a bilateral agreement with the UK. The EU will not sign up to an agreement which allows to UK to depart from EU law to the UK's advantage and the EU's disadvantage on things like state aid to companies, or emissions standards. It will want a level playing field in trade and that will mean a lot of EU law as part of the agreement. The reality is that the more closely the Brexit trade agreement replicates EU law, the greater the influence of the ECJ will be. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the government was ""clearly backtracking on its earlier red lines and saying there has to be some form of dispute resolution through some form of judicial process"". He added: ""We have said that all along."" Asked if Labour would vote against the government's key piece of Brexit legislation, the repeal bill, when MPs returned from their summer break, Mr Corbyn said: ""We will make that decision just before the vote."" The pro-EU Open Britain campaign group said the government's policy paper was a ""climbdown camouflaged in jingoistic rhetoric"". The group called it ""frustratingly vague"", adding that in almost every example it provides, the ECJ would have ""substantial direct or indirect power over the proposed new relationship between Britain and the EU"". The government said it was not committing to following any of the arrangements set out, ruling out an ""off the shelf"" model. And sources played down the significance of the word ""direct"", saying it meant ECJ rulings would no longer automatically apply to the UK and that the court would no longer be able to strike down domestic UK laws. This video can not be played John Redwood and Chuka Umunna clash over ECJ Asked about her government's position, Mrs May said: ""What we will be able to do is to make our own laws - Parliament will make our laws - it is British judges that will interpret those laws, and it will be the British Supreme Court that will be the ultimate arbiter of those laws."" Earlier Justice Minister Dominic Raab said there would be ""divergence"" between UK and EU case law after Brexit, adding: ""It is precisely because there will be that divergence as we take back control that it makes sense for the UK to keep half an eye on the case law of the EU, and for the EU to keep half an eye on the case law of the UK."" In response, Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament's lead negotiator, tweeted that the ECJ had to ""keep both eyes open"" to protect citizens' rights. The ECJ's remit extends into many of the areas where the UK is hoping to draw up new arrangements with the EU, including trade and citizens' rights. Mr Raab said ""some form of arbitration"" would be needed, but that this would not be akin to a European court. Arbitration is where disputes are settled by a neutral third party. The UK and the EU could each appoint arbitrators and agree on a third, Mr Raab suggested. Decides whether the institutions of the EU are acting legally, and settles disputes between them Ensures that the member states of the EU are complying with their legal obligations as set out in the EU treaties; and allows member states to challenge EU legislation Interprets EU law at the request of national courts The SNP said the government had accepted the UK must continue to take account of judgements from the ECJ so it now needed to ""ditch their previous so-called red lines to ensure a deal can be found"". SNP External Affairs Secretary Fiona Hyslop said the best option for Scotland and the rest of the UK was to stay in the EU single market. Liberal Democrat leader Vince Cable said Mrs May's ""red lines are becoming more blurred by the day"", saying the ECJ had ""served Britain's interests well"" and should not be ""trashed"".

Gangs banned from city in landmark ruling,"This video can not be played Police try to serve injunctions to Birmingham gang members Two rival criminal groups have been hit with what police describe as the largest ever gang injunction. Eighteen men, aged between 19 and 29 and some in prison, are banned from parts of Birmingham and must register phones and vehicles with police. The two-year orders aim to disrupt gang-related violence between the Burger Bar Boys and Johnson Crew. West Midlands Police said it was ""a landmark ruling"". How two rivals poisoned a city's streets The orders follow a spate of firearms offences in the city in 2015 and 2016, but the gangs have struck fear across parts of Birmingham for many years. They gained notoriety in 2003 when their violent feud claimed the lives of two girls - Letisha Shakespeare and Charlene Ellis - outside a late-night new year party in the city.Four men were later jailed for life for their murders.,external The gangs have alsobeen behind countless drive-by shootings,,externaldrug dealing, intimidation, robberies and kidnappings. The men are banned from entering the city centre, Handsworth, Newtown, Winson Green and Lozells Letisha's mother Marcia, an anti-gun campaigner, welcomed the injunctions. ""I see gangs as vermin in Birmingham and any means to help it stop spreading to vulnerable, naive and innocent young people is a positive way forward in our war on violent crime,"" she said. ""As I have said time and time again, violent crime has no winners. It just causes heartache, pain and has a life-changing impact on innocent victims and the perpetrators' families."" After more recent incidents of gun crime in the city, West Midlands Police and the council sought to secure the injunctions in a civil case heard at Birmingham Crown Court earlier this year. The force secured interim injunctions in 2016 and said at the time it did not want to identify anyone until they were permanent.The BBC revealed their names after obtaining the county court documents. More than 80 people from the Home Office and police gave evidence between February and June ahead of the orders being granted in July, which the force has revealed for the first time now. Two have already been issued, three men are being sought by police and three properties were visited by officers on Wednesday. The men are forbidden from associating with each other and entering the city centre, Handsworth, Newtown, Winson Green and Lozells. In a copy of an injunction seen by the BBC, gang members are also banned from appearing in music videos that include material linked to the Burger Bar Boys and Johnson Crew. One such music video was shown during the court proceedings. Police visited properties on Wednesday to serve injunctions Ten other men will receive the orders in jail where restrictions will be imposed on certain visitors to limit any gang associations, police said. Among those to be given the injunctions in prison are two men believed to have been the ""armed response"" faction of the Burger Bar Boys. Reial Phillips, 21, from Winson Green was jailed for 27 years last year after seven people were injured in a series of shootings during a feud with members of the Johnson Crew. His co-defendant 23-year-old Ashai Gray, from Walsall, was jailed for nine years after admitting conspiracy to supply cocaine and heroin. Police said their actions""brought fear"" to people in the West Midlands. Gang injunctions came into force in England and Wales in 2011.Home Office figures show,externalthat between January 2011 and January 2014, 88 had been put in place. The first one issued in the West Midlands was in 2012. But solicitor Errol Robinson, who represented two of the four men jailed for the new year murders, criticised the move. ""They don't change behaviour or address underlying issues,"" he said. ""Injunctions become a bit of a trophy and encourage rebellion. Gang members like to show that they're not listening to orders so will breach orders. ""It's a cheap way of trying to solve crime but there is no evidence to suggest that they work. This video can not be played Ex Birmingham gang member says injunctions are pointless ""They're just a cosmetic gesture to show people that something is being done about gangs - but actually the results are minimum to none."" From former gang members the BBC has spoken to, there is little support for the mechanism, BBC Midlands Correspondent Sima Kotecha said. She said a number of gang members had said that if a person is banned from going to a certain part of a city, they will just go somewhere else and find others who have the same goal of causing violence and disruption. The gangs gained notoriety in 2003 when friends Charlene Ellis, 18, and Letisha Shakespeare, 17, were shot dead outside a new year party Birmingham has seen another spike in gun and knife crime in 2017, with nine fatal stabbings this year. None of the men named in the injunctions are involved, police said. Det Sgt Ian Comfort said: ""This is relatively new legislation and we believe that securing final full injunctions on such a large number of gang members is a UK first. ""The injunctions are applied for in the civil court in addition to sentences handed out by the criminal court for offences. They are an additional measure to help control the offenders and keep the community safe."" Supt Mat Shaer, neighbourhood policing superintendent for Birmingham, said the injunctions were ""not sought lightly"" and the police, council and other groups had already made ""exhaustive efforts with these men"" and their families to try and steer them away gang culture. Organised gangs in Birmingham have been a part of the city's life since the 1870s. Some have been mythologised on TV such as the Peaky Blinders. But today's gangs linked to guns and drugs are far from glamorous and bring terror and misery to many people's lives. The names Burger Bar Boys and Johnson Crew sprang on to the crime scene in the late 1990s. Chaotic and quick to wreak violence, the gangs' most shocking crime came at a new year's party in 2003, when two innocent teenage girls, Letisha Shakespeare and Charlene Ellis, died in a spray of machine-gun fire in a drive-by shooting as members of the Burger Bar Boys attempted to kill a Johnson Crew man standing outside. That shocking display of gang callousness led to a concerted effort by government, police and the city council, and 10 years later it led some to believe that the gangs had been defeated as gun crime fell dramatically. But in the last 18 months, a new generation of would-be gang members have arisen and shootings have begun to surge upwards. Even in the last few weeks, the police have been shot at as they carried out an anti-gun operation in the Ladywood area of the city. The men made subject to the injunctions Naasir Francis, 19, from Nechells Baboucar Huma, 19, from Handsworth Akeen Ivy-Foster, 20, from Springhill Ravelle Hutchinson, 20, from Winson Green Rayani Sutherland, 21, from Aston Omarni Bernard-Sewell, 21, from Selly Oak Lawrence Morgan, 21, from Nechells Jerome Jones, 21, from Erdington Jerome Christie, 21, from Nechells Reial Phillips, 21, from Winson Green Ushane Jeffers, 23, from Newtown Kayne Robinson, 23, from Springhill Ashai Grey, 23, from Walsall Jacob Brown, 24, from Handsworth Cash Wallace, 24, from Winson Green Ishmail Lee, 29, from Wolverhampton Isaac Duffus, 28, from Erdington Tesfa Bernard-Wheeler, 21, from Hockley Gang injunctions 'a pointless exercise' Video, 00:00:34Gang injunctions 'a pointless exercise' How two gangs poisoned a city's streets Man jailed after gang feud shootings Men linked to 'gun or gang crime' named Injunctions for firearms accused brothers.

Rescued piglets served up as sausages,"Firefighters celebrated their reward by putting the sausages on a barbecue A litter of piglets whose bacon was saved from a barn fire has been served up as dinner to the firefighters who rescued them. The 18 piglets and two sows survived the fire in Wiltshire in February, which saw 60 tonnes of hay catch fire. In a controversial move, farm manager Rachel Rivers thanked the Pewsey fire team by giving them sausages. The firefighters initially said the bangers were ""fantastic"" but following complaints have since said sorry. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta) said the piglets were ""no better off"" for escaping the fire. ""We'll be sending Dorset and Wiltshire Fire and Rescue Service packs of vegan sausages so that they can see how easy it is to truly be heroes for pigs - by sparing them all suffering,"" said spokesman Mimi Bekhechi. More on this story and other news from the West of England This video can not be played Farmer Rachel Rivers gifted sausages to firefighters The animals were given a six-month stay of execution when they were rescued from the farm at Milton Lilbourne. But, having been reared for meat, they were then slaughtered and delivered as sausages to the fire station team, which barbecued them. Ms Rivers defended the gift, saying farming is her livelihood and way of life. ""I gave those animals the best quality of life I could ever give until the time they go to slaughter and they go into the food chain,"" she said. ""You do feel sad at the end of it... but to bring them down for [the firefighters] was a good way of saying 'thank you'."" The farm's owner, Canon Gerald Osbourne, added: ""An inevitable part of farming is the death of an animal which gives us the food to eat."" The apology was posted on the Pewsey fire station Facebook page The 18 piglets and two sows ""can't be kept as pets"" their owner said The delighted firefighters said the sausages were ""highly recommended"" and thanked the farmer ""for her generosity"". ""We can tell no porkies, the sausages were fantastic,"" a spokesman said on Tuesday. However, the fire service has since removed the pictures of the impromptu barbecue from its Facebook page.

Airport pipe bomb plotter jailed,"Muhammad was jailed for 18 years at Manchester Crown Court A man who tried to smuggle a pipe bomb on to a plane at Manchester Airport has been jailed for 18 years. The ""crude improvised explosive device"" was found in Nadeem Muhammad's luggage as he passed security on 30 January to try to board a plane to Bergamo, Italy. After sentencing Muhammad, 43, the judge criticised both airport staff and police who did not initially think the device was ""potentially viable"". Greater Manchester Police said security procedures had been reviewed. Muhammad, of Tinline Street, Bury, had denied possessing explosives with intent to endanger life but was previously found guilty by a jury at Manchester Crown Court. He was attempting to board a Ryanair flight when the item was discovered and told airport officials someone else had put it in his luggage. A forensic examination of the device later found it contained nitroglycerin and nitrocellulose, which led to Muhammad's home in Italy being searched. Judge Patrick Field QC said he was ""alarmed"" about some of the evidence in the case After being questioned by Italian police, he was released and boarded a flight back to the UK on 12 February and arrested by UK officers shortly after landing. A forensic examination of the device later found it was ""potentially viable"", his trial heard. Judge Patrick Field QC said there was no obvious motivation for Muhammad's actions. After sentencing he was ""alarmed"" about some of the evidence in the case and about ""the lack of concern"" expressed by both airport officials and police. ""Airport security staff reached a wholly erroneous and potentially dangerous conclusion - as a result one member of staff even put the device in her pocket and tested it in the shoe X-ray machine,"" he said. He said that had ""put herself and fellow employees and members of public at risk"". ""The situation was compounded when the police became involved because they too readily accepted it wasn't dangerous and an early opportunity to arrest him was missed."" Judge Field QC said there was ""a risk he could have escaped justice altogether"" and it was ""good luck rather than good judgement"" that ""this matter came to a satisfactory conclusion"". He added: ""In these dangerous times there is no room for complacency and I hope security at Manchester Airport will be subject to a review at the highest level."" In response to the judge's comments a Manchester Airport spokesman said: ""Security is our number one priority and we work closely with [the] government, police and other agencies to provide passengers with a safe and secure environment. ""In this instance, our security team successfully detected a device hidden inside the lining of a suitcase. It was deemed to be a suspicious item and passed to police to investigate further."" It added: ""These actions prevented a potentially dangerous item being taken on board an aircraft and, ultimately, to a successful prosecution."" Assistant Chief Constable Russ Jackson said it was an ""extremely serious incident"" Greater Manchester Police Assistant Chief Constable Russ Jackson said: ""Both the airport and police have reviewed our security procedure to ensure that operating procedures are followed on every occasion when there's a suspicious incident."" He said it was ""without a doubt an extremely serious incident at a time when people are concerned about terrorism, especially here in Manchester"". ""Whilst it should be acknowledged that security checks were effective in finding the item, the assessment of the device should have been more comprehensive and should have taken place much sooner."" ACC Jackson added: ""These lessons have been learned and reviews of our operating procedures have already taken place.""

Trump: I'll close government to build wall,"This video can not be played Donald Trump defends his Charlottesville response, but cuts out a key part Donald Trump says he will close down the US government if necessary to build his wall along the Mexico border. The president told supporters at a ""Make America Great Again"" rally in Phoenix, Arizona, that the opposition Democrats were being ""obstructionist"". During the 80-minute speech, he also took aim at the media, blaming them for giving far right groups ""a platform"". But he selectively quoted his initial response to violence at a far-right rally that left one woman dead. He omitted the much-criticised claim that""many sides"" had to shoulder the blamefor violence in Charlottesville, Virginia. President Trump wants Congress to finance his controversial plan to build a ""big, beautiful"" wall along the United States' border with Mexico to keep out illegal immigrants. But Republicans will need the support of Democrats to secure funding for the wall in a government spending bill, which they are unlikely to get. In his speech, Mr Trump said the Democrats were ""putting all of America's safety at risk"" by opposing the wall. He said immigration officers who worked in the area said it was ""vital"" to stem the flow of illegal immigrants. Six things that could topple Trump's wall What Trump's rally taught us He said that, if it came to it, he would risk a government shutdown - which is what happens when legislation funding the federal government cannot be passed by Congress and non-essential services stop. ""Now the obstructionist Democrats would like us not to do it, but believe me if we have to close down our government, we are building that wall,"" Mr Trump said, adding that ""the American people voted for immigration control"". If President Trump wants a government shutdown all he has to do is refuse to sign a funding bill sent to him by Congress. Capitol Hill is set to debate a new budget measure this autumn, and unless it is passed federal operations will be in limbo by 1 October. By James Cook, BBC North America correspondent, Phoenix The president is struggling to realise his central campaign pledge to build a wall on the Mexican border Donald Trump's signature campaign promise - to ""build that wall"" - epitomised his appeal to the nation, an apparently simple solution to a problem freighted with racial and economic undertones. Not only that but it would be free! Mexico would pay, as Mr Trump and his cheering crowds repeatedly insisted. But it turns out that governing is harder than campaigning. Construction of prototypes near San Diego in California - which had been scheduled for this summer - has been delayed until at least December by a legal challenge from one rejected bidder. Ranchers, environmentalists and some businesses on the border have raised objections to the plan, while one Republican congressman in Texas, Will Hurd, has even described the wall as the most expensive and least effective way to secure the border. Mexico, needless to say, is not keen to write a cheque. Faced with the need to win over doubters on the detail, and explain why this would be a lot of money well spent, Mr Trump has instead chosen to raise the stakes with an ""all or nothing"" approach. This should not come as a surprise. President Trump attacked the media in the campaign-style speech, saying reporters had misrepresented his ""perfect"" words in the wake of the violence in Charlottesville, where Heather Heyer was killed after a car ploughed into a crowd of people protesting against far-right demonstrators including neo-Nazis. He accused ""truly dishonest people in the media and the fake media"" of ""trying to take away our history and heritage"" because, he said, they ""don't like our country"". What made Trump remarks so offensive? He quoted his first public response to the violence on 12 August, which was criticised by both Republicans and Democratsfor not explicitly condemning the far-right. ""This is what I said on Saturday: 'We're closely following the terrible events unfolding in Charlottesville, Virginia,' - this is me speaking. 'We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence.' That's me speaking on Saturday, right after the event,"" he said. This video can not be played Police pepper spray protesters outside the Trump rally But his full quote was: ""We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides, on many sides."" Separately, the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination has criticised the US for what it said was a ""failure at the highest political level"" to reject ""racist violent events"". Referring to Charlottesville,the committee said,externalit was issuing a rare ""early warning"", which has been used in recent years in countries including Burundi, Iraq, Nigeria and the Ivory Coast. Nafta:The US, Mexico and Canada have begun talks on revising their trade deal, and negotiators are due to meet again on 1 September. But Mr Trump said he thought he would ""probably end up terminating Nafta"" North Korea:He sounded hopeful about a reduction in tensions. Referring to North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, Mr Trump said: ""I respect the fact that he is starting to respect us."" He added: ""And maybe - probably not, but maybe - something positive can come about"" Sheriff Joe Arpaio:The US president hinted he would pardon the controversial former Arizona sheriff, who rose to national prominence because of his tough stance against illegal immigration. He said that Joe Arpaio - who wasfound guilty of criminal contemptin July over his detention of migrants - ""is going to be just fine"", but he would not yet formally pardon him because ""I don't want to cause any controversy"" Responding to the speech, the former National Intelligence director James Clappertold CNN,externalthat he was questioning Donald Trump's ""fitness"" for office. ""I also am beginning to wonder about his motivation for it,"" he said, adding he found the rally ""downright scary and disturbing"". Ruben Gallego, a Democratic Party congressman in Arizona, said it was the worst-ever speech by a US president. ""It was all about him, it was not about the country,"" he told the BBC. A former British ambassador to the US, Peter Westmacott, said he saw parallels with the establishment of Nazi Germany in 1933. Allow Twitter content?

Body identified as missing journalist,"This video can not be played Kim Wall's death: What we know so far A headless torso found in waters off Denmark has been identified as missing Swedish journalist Kim Wall, Danish police say. DNA from the torso matched that from Ms Wall's hairbrush and toothbrush. Chief investigator Jens Moller Jensen said that the torso had been weighted down with metal in an apparent attempt to stop it floating. Ms Wall was last seen alive on 10 August as she departed on a submarine trip with inventor Peter Madsen. The submarine sank hours after the search for Ms Wall began, after her partner reported that she had not returned from the trip. Mr Madsen, who designed and built the submarine, was charged with negligent manslaughter and is in detention. He initially said he had dropped her off safely near Copenhagen, but has since said she died in an accident and that he had ""buried"" her at sea. An âexceptionalâ journalist remembered What we know Who is DIY submariner Peter Madsen? Danish police believe the 40-tonne submarine was deliberately sunk by Mr Madsen. Traces of blood have been found inside the submarine, and they also match Ms Wall. The remains were found on a beach south of Copenhagen on Monday. Mr Jensen would not comment on the cause of death but said forensic investigations were still being carried out and police were looking for the rest of her body. As well as the metal attached to the torso, Mr Jensen said the remains were mutilated in what appeared to be an attempt to ensure that decomposition gases passed out of the body, to make it less likely to float. Kim Wall's mother Ingrid wrote of the family's ""boundless sorrow"" at the news that her daughter's remains had been found. ""During the horrendous days since Kim disappeared, we have received countless examples of how loved and appreciated she was, as a person and as a friend, as well as a professional journalist,"" Ingrid Wall said in a family statement released on Facebook. ""From all corners of the world we have received testimony to how she was able to be a person who made a difference."" Mr Madsen and Ms Wall were photographed just before departing on 10 August Ms Wall, 30, was reported missing by her boyfriend in the early hours of 11 August, after she failed to return from the trip on Peter Madsen's homemade submarine, the Nautilus. A freelance journalist who had written for the Guardian, New York Times and South China Morning Post, she is said to have been researching a feature about the inventor and the Nautilus, which he built in 2008 with crowdfunding. Emergency services scoured the area of sea to the east of Copenhagen and the submarine was eventually spotted from a lighthouse south of the Oresund bridge between Denmark and Sweden. Within 30 minutes, the vessel had sunk and Mr Madsen had to be rescued. For 10 days, the search for the journalist continued. A torso was found by a passing cyclist on a beach near Koge Bay on Monday. Police said the next day that the arms, legs and head had been deliberately cut off. They finally confirmed it was Kim Wall in a tweet early on Wednesday. Mr Madsen's lawyer, Betina Hald Engmark, said the news that the torso was Ms Wall did not change her client's position, that the journalist had died in an accident. He was ""very relieved"" the torso had been identified, she told Danish media. ""He wants nothing else than for this case to be cleared up."" Peter Madsen pleaded not guilty in a closed-door judicial hearing earlier this month. Copenhagen police are re-examining old cases, as is standard in such investigations, according to the chief prosecutor, including the death of a 22-year-old Japanese woman, whose torso was found in Copenhagen harbour in 1986. That case has never been solved. Danish authorities are continuing to look for Ms Wall's remains at sea and along the coast An 'exceptional' journalist remembered Journalist 'died in submarine accident' Danish sub was 'deliberately sunk' Who is Kim Wall's killer Peter Madsen?

Car keys stolen from site near airport,"Car Park Manchester runs a meet and greet service that serves Manchester Airport Up to 130 sets of car keys have been stolen from a site used by a meet-and-greet company offering long-stay parking near Manchester Airport. Four cars were also taken from the Car Park Manchester site in Hale, the Manchester Evening Newsreported.,external Police said the full numbers involved were not yet known because many of the vehicles' owners are still on holiday.

Bev Young heard her car keys were missing while she was still abroad. She said: ""I fly back tomorrow, not knowing what to expect or who is going to get my friend and I home - two hours away.

""I'm just absolutely devastated because I booked it."" Matthew Griffiths was also informed his keys had been stolen.  However, he praised the car park's staff for the way they handled the situation. ""Upon visiting the car park I could see they had a rough time. I was greeted by the most kind and apologetic owner of the business,"" he said. ""I'd like to thank the owners of the car park for assisting me with the issue to their best ability.""

US Navy sacks fleet commander after crash,"Vice Adm Joseph Aucoin was due to retire from his position in the coming weeks The US Navy has dismissed Vice Adm Joseph Aucoin as commander of the Seventh Fleet following a string of collisions involving warships in Asia. Ten sailors are still missing after the USS John S McCain collided with an oil tanker near Singapore on Monday. Navy officials say human remains have since been found in sealed compartments on board the ship, which is now in port in Singapore. The crash was the fourth such incident in a year. In a statement,external, the Navy said it had lost confidence in Vice Adm Aucoin's ability to command. The Seventh Fleet,external, based in Yokosuka, Japan, is the largest forward-Â­deployed fleet in the US Navy, with some 50 to 70 vessels and submarines. Vice Adm Aucoin, who has been its commander since 2015, was due to retire within weeks. His designated successor will replace him immediately. His removal is the latest in a series of steps taken by Navy officials after the USS John S McCain collision. It is not clear when a formal announcement will be made. The incident triggered a rare worldwide ""operational pause"" of the US Navy's fleets as well as a review of operations. The USS John S McCain was east of Singapore when itcollided with the oil tanker Alnic MCbefore dawn on Monday. The collision left a large hole in the destroyer's port side - the left-hand side of the vessel facing forward - and flooded compartments including crew berths. Five sailors were injured. This video can not be played The USS John S McCain suffered damage midship to port The destroyer is now at the Changi naval base in Singapore. Ships, equipment and aircraft from the American, Indonesian, Malaysian and Singapore navies have been involved in the search for the 10 missing sailors. On Tuesday, officialsannounced that human remains had been foundin the sealed flooded compartments of the destroyer. They are also verifying the identity of a body found at sea by the Malaysian navy. The Alnic MC sustained damage to a tank near the front of the ship, but none of its crew were injured and there were no oil spills. The incident marked the fourth time this year that a US Navy vessel has been involved in an accident in Asia. Two months ago, seven US sailors were killed when the USS Fitzgerald collided with a container ship in Japanese waters near the port city of Yokosuka. In pictures: USS Fitzgerald crash Why ship collisions still happen Those who died were found in flooded berths on board the ship after the collision caused a gash under the warship's waterline. The US Navy saidlast week that about a dozen sailors would be disciplined, and the commanding officer and other senior crew would be taken off the ship. In May, aguided missile cruiser collided,externalwith a South Korean fishing vessel, while in January another cruiser ran aground near the 7th Fleet base in Yokosuka.

"Forget summer, it's time to prepare for Christmas","A bit of fake snow can almost turn summer into Christmas Many of us are still on our summer holidays so thinking about Christmas might seem premature. But for businesses providing festive food, drinks and presents, things are already gearing up. The festive season begins for a lot of retailers when they send out their invitations for summer Christmas events. Companies hold them to make sure their products are included in the December issues of magazines. On a balmy summer's evening in London, while groups of people are enjoying a few cocktails under a cloudless sky, just off Oxford Street the Christmas festivities are already underway. A branch of the Italian restaurant chain, Carluccio's, is holding its Christmas press day. Amongst the mounds of fake snow, exquisitely wrapped presents and piles of slightly melted Italian chocolates, head of retail Emma Woodford stands proudly by the panettone display. If you're fed up with Christmas pudding, you could always try panettone ""Christmas is the biggest time of the year for us and we love it,"" she enthuses, showing off a novel twist on the sweet Italian bread. ""This has a prosecco filling which is piped to get an even coverage. I think it's a new classic."" The panettone come into their stores in mid-October - so could it take over as the new Christmas pudding? ""I'm a big fan of both,"" replies Emma diplomatically. Waitrose is also looking to innovate when it comes to flavours. Last year, its Christmas range included a banana and bacon trifle. This year they're experimenting with chocolate mince pies. So how does the company get its Christmas stock right and make sure it doesn't end up with piles of reduced food in January? Natalie Mitchell, head of brand development and product innovation says it's all in the preparation. ""Planning starts 18-24 months in advance, we look at global trends and try to understand where customers might want something different. Forecasting is a military operation and the main thing is not to run out of products."" Will Waitrose's planned chocolate mince pies be this year's festive food winner? In an air-conditioned temporary show room on Baker Street, toy manufacturer Tomy is showing off its festive must-haves. ""I put up the Christmas tree this morning,"" says Nicola Jenkins, Tomy's UK head of marketing, above the noise of a video game. ""Predicting trends is always a bit of science and a bit of luck. We put the products in the hands of parents, children and influencers - word of mouth is really important."" So what are Nicola's picks for this year? ""Pokemon is still really hot and we're expecting the next level of Lightseekers games to do well."" Someone has to deliver the presents and in an amusement park near Copenhagen, Santas from all over the world hold their annual congress at the end of July. It's summer, it's Copenhagen, so it must be time for the annual Santa congress An attendee from northern Denmark explains why they meet up in the summer heat. ""We're too busy in November and December, we have to make sure all the reindeer are fit and that the elves have made all their toys."" So what do 160 Santas, elves and all the Mrs Santas get up to every year? ""Networking of course, then there's the pentathlon event, a lovely lunch and a fashion show."" Fun and frolics aside, Christmas is a serious business. A successful marketing campaign can hugely boost a brand and every year the supermarkets wage war for the best Christmas advert. Theo Izzard-Brown of creative agency McCann London says that planning for a festive spectacular starts in January or February. ""It's become like the Super Bowl. John Lewis has had great success, they've set the mould."" Mr Izzard-Brown's firm represents rival retail giant Aldi, which last year created a campaign featuring a carrot called Kevin. ""There was lots of discussion as to what his hair should look like and how tall he should be, but ultimately it became about how we could use this character in all our marketing and get people to talk about it."" Mr Izzard-Brown says the campaign paid off: ""We sold thousands of Kevin soft toys, I'm told you can still get them on Ebay for vastly inflated prices."" Cocktail bar chain Be At One reckons spiced pear could be this year's Christmas drink For bars and restaurants Christmas is one of the most hectic times of the year and Andrew Stones, of cocktail bar chain Be At One, starts planning as soon as the last Christmas party finishes. ""I try 800 cocktails over the year to make sure we've got the festive menu right. We like to incorporate seasonal flavours, this year I think spiced pear will do well."" Be At One got its first Christmas bookings in March. ""One person's often given the job of booking the office party and it's a big responsibility so people like to get in early."" The Las Iguanas restaurant chain says it has already taken 1,700 Christmas bookings At the Latin American themed restaurant group, Las Iguanas, Gareth Lock says that by July it had already had 1,700 Christmas bookings from guests looking for a non-traditional celebration. Last year the top Christmas menu sellers were chicken fajita, sirloin steak and Bahian coconut chicken, and the festivities seem to be getting earlier every year, he says. ""At the end of July our teams got together in a boiling hot hotel in Birmingham dressed as Santas and reindeer to work out our strategy."" That strategy includes adding a seasonal staple to the menu for the first time. ""We're trialling Christmas Day opening so we've decided to offer turkey; but there'll definitely be a twist."" Christmas seems to come earlier every year - the trick is to get the seasonal planning done early Corporate Britain gets into the Christmas spirit early but what about the people who all the effort's aimed at, the public? Outside Selfridges, a trio of visitors from Finland were more than happy to contemplate buying baubles in summer. ""I start planning in summer,"" says Diina, ""it takes away the stress at Christmas. In Finland you can't start Christmas shopping until November, even though we're the land of reindeer, snow and Santa Claus."" In today's competitive selling environment, shops, bars and restaurants have to get it right. George MacDonald, of Retail Week, says success boils to down to a few key rules. ""It's about getting on top of new trends, having exclusive products and doing the basics perfectly.""

Naomi Campbell shames Vogue over diversity,"Vogue's new editor Edward Enninful has hired Naomi Campbell Naomi Campbell has criticised the lack of diversity among the staff at British Vogue under its previous editor. The supermodel posted the magazine's last staff photo, which featured no black faces among the 55-strong team. It was taken before Edward Enninfultook the reinsas the magazine's first black editor earlier this month.

Broadcaster and commentator Edward Adoo said the Vogue staff photo looked like a snapshot of ""very old school Britain"". He told BBC News: ""It seemed there was no room for anyone else. It seemed like the Sloanies' club. In the whole fashion industry, the mainstream element feels very middle class, very white, very controlled, and there needs to be some kind of breakthrough. ""I think Edward Enninful is a step in the right direction. He's black, he's gay and he reaches out to different people, and I think that's what's needed."" Campbell has the status to speak out, whereas younger models have less power, Adoo said. ""For Naomi Campbell to say it, it would certainly silence the critics because of her calibre and status. ""But for someone who's up-and-coming to speak out and say, I feel as if I'm not being treated right, or there are no opportunities, they may never ever get a call again.""

Kim Wall: Pint-sized journalist who packed a punch,"Kim Wall ""never made a spectacle of the characters she reported on"" It is a ""black irony"" that Kim Wall - the journalist whose remains were found off Denmark - died while working in such a familiar and seemingly safe area, say friends and family. The 30-year-old freelance reporter had travelled the world in pursuit of her stories - from Uganda to Cuba to the Marshall Islands to Kenya to New York City. At one point she even ""slipped into"" North Korea. She specialised in stories about identity, gender or subcultures, often with social justice themes. ""Kim has worked as a journalist in many dangerous places, and we have often been worried about her,"" her parents wrote ina letter to Danish TV,externalwhile she was still missing. ""That something could happen to her in Copenhagen, just a few kilometres from the childhood home, we could not imagine at all."" Who is DIY submariner Peter Madsen? Inventor says toxic fumes killed Kim Wall What we know Ms Wall was a formidable character and driven journalist, those who knew her say. She was born in 1987 and grew up in a close-knit community in the small town of Trelleborg in southern Sweden, just across the strait dividing Denmark from Sweden. This video can not be played Kim Wall's death - what we know so far She studied international relations at London School of Economics and went on to gain a place on the rigorous masters programme of Columbia University's School of Journalism - described as the ""Oxbridge of journalism"". Even within her cohort she was top of the class, winning honours in her year, her classmate and friend Anna Codrea-Rado told the BBC. ""What made her journalistic abilities so exceptional was that she looked for quirky stories but with a bigger narrative,"" she said. ""She reported them deeply - she never made a spectacle of the characters. Her reporting was rock-solid."" Her interest in people and stories made her a great party guest. ""She was one of the few people that could lift a room just by being in it,"" Ms Wall's friend Christopher Harress (left) told the BBC ""She was very bubbly and warm, the kind of person who had fantastic stories about the things she was working on - you could jump straight past the small talk. ""She was intellectual, so well-travelled and had such varied interests. She was interested in quirky and eccentric stories. If you were at a party you'd end up passing hours just chatting to her."" This admiration has been echoed by numerous friends. Ms Wall wrote ""about subcultures, about a globalised world in rapid change"", says Victoria Grevein Sweden's Expressen newspaper,external. ""About life in a huge shopping centre in Kampala's Chinatown, about Cuba's underground internet providers who download and disseminate new episodes of Keeping Up with the Kardashians to people from all walks of life in Havana.

""As news organisations grapple with shrinking budgets, they increasingly rely on freelancers, who cost less and are often willing to take on the attendant risks reporting in places they wouldn't send their staff to,"" writes Sruthi Gottipatiin the Guardian,external. ""Even against this backdrop, the competition is fierce to place stories and female freelancers work hard to ensure their gender isn't calculated as a liability. So they clam up about the dangers they face and sometimes report before being commissioned to do so."" Madsen and Ms Wall were photographed just before departing on 10 August This pressure to secure good material before there is even a formal commission could explain why no news organisation has confirmed it gave Ms Wall the assignment she died carrying out. A friend and fellow freelance journalist,May Jeong, wrote that US technology magazine Wired had been in touch with Ms Wall,externalabout Peter Madsen's do-it-yourself rocket and submarine projects. Ms Wall was staying in Copenhagen with her partner, Danish designer Ole Stobbe, when she began investigating the old harbour workshops where Madsen and other enthusiasts had built the submarine UC3 Nautilus. On 10 August 2017, she boarded the submarine to interview him and was never seen again - her mutilated body was found by a cyclist 11 days later. In April 2018 Madsen was convicted of murder and now faces life in jail. Kim Wall's grieving parents Ingrid and Joachim May Jeong said Ms Wall was used to being in ""uncomfortable"" situations as a reporter, and ""in stepping onto that submarine, Kim was doing what any reporter onto a good story would have done"". Friends and family have urged the world not to let the nature of her death overshadow her life. ""Please don't remember her as the murdered Swedish journalist who died in a grisly horror straight out of a crime drama,"" Ms Codrea-Radosaid on Twitter,external. ""Remember her work."" This month the Swedish Publicists' Association gave a posthumous 10,000-krona (Â£843; $1,177) scholarship to Ms Wall. Her parents Joachim and Ingrid donated it tothe Kim Wall Memorial Fund,external, which will award it ""to a young female journalist who wants to work in Kim's spirit"", the family said.

What price would you put on a passport?,"Fiddling distractedly with her headscarf and in words little louder than a whisper, Amar Al-Sadi tells me Malta has saved her from a life of bombs, rubble and deadly disease. Her family escaped war-torn Yemen on a United Nations evacuation flight two years ago. ""I don't think anyone in the world would want to live that way,"" she said. ""We were asleep one day and we heard a really big bomb nearby. It was really scary. ""I still have friends in Yemen. They tell me people are dying of cholera. Some of them do try to leave, but they can't because no-one will accept their passports now."" Amar is neither in Malta as a refugee, nor an economic migrant. The 21-year-old, her parents and four siblings are now all Maltese citizens. They weren't born in Malta, and they didn't have any Maltese family. So how do they have Maltese passports? It costs at least 880,000 euros to buy a Maltese passport They bought them, as have several thousand others in Malta since the country started selling passports in 2014. Unlike residency programmes or investor visas, which many countries (including the UK) offer to foreigners, Malta's Individual Investor Programme grants full citizenship to successful applicants. It costs a minimum of 880,000 euros (Â£800,000; $1m), rising for each additional family member. Three quarters of that is a non-refundable contribution to Malta's National Development and Social Fund, which finances education, health and job creation projects. The rest is split between investments in government bonds and owning or renting a home for at least five years. For more, listen to Simon Tulett on BBC World Service's Business Daily programme Malta is not the only country to sell passports The Caribbean island of St Kitts and Nevis has been selling citizenship since 1984, but since 2011 Austria, Bulgaria, Hungary and Cyprus have all launched their own schemes. ""It's the insurance policy of the 21st Century,"" according to Christian Kaelin, the head of residency and citizenship planning firm, Henley and Partners. He says there's been a ""rapid expansion"" in this area, partly fuelled by governments looking for new revenue sources, but also because of geopolitical unrest, for example in the Middle East. Wealthy people can use such schemes as a way of escaping trouble or dramatic political change. But aside from security concerns, many simply want to offer opportunities to their children or make it easier to run a business. ""It's about mobility and personal flexibility, with access to other countries. We have a client who is an American but he has two important investments in Italy and the Netherlands,"" Mr Kaelin says. Malta is a member of the EU and the passport-free Schengen zone ""He needs a work permit in both. If he acquires citizenship in Malta, we don't need to deal with any work permit or other issues,"" says Mr Kaelin. That's because Malta is in the European Union and part of its Schengen Area - enabling passport-free movement across most of EU. This is one of the scheme's strongest selling points. Enquiries from the UK rose slightly after the Brexit vote, but no-one has yet signed up. ""It's clear the UK will find some sort of arrangement with the EU,"" says Mr Kaelin. ""If a Brit comes to me and asks if they should buy a Maltese passport I'd say no forget it, just relax."" Malta's citizenship scheme is also popular because it's relatively cheap and quick. Applicants usually receive their passports within 12 to 18 months. The programme requires applicants to either buy a property worth at least 350,000 euros, or rent one for at least 16,000 euros a year for five years. More than 80% of applicants for passports take the rental option. However, there is increasing concern that many properties remain, leading some people in Malta to question applicants' intentions. ""These billionaires aren't interested in living in Malta, they just want access to the EU"" says Maltese journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia. ""They probably have no intention of ever setting foot here. If they were really interested in staying they would buy a home."" Malta's central bank has said the Individual Investor Programme is one of the factors pushing up house prices in Malta by some 7% each year, and rents by about 10%. Jonathan Cardona, chief executive of Identity Malta, which runs the programme, agrees EU access is a key selling point for a Maltese passport but argues that the island is an attractive investment in its own right. ""I know one who has invested about 70m euros in Malta. Another one is in the process of opening a factory in the pharmaceutical industry, and I know of another who has opened an IT company. ""Some of them might not have invested seriously yet, but you can never tell what might happen in a few years' time."" Malta's citizenship scheme makes a significant contribution to the economy, says Jonathan Cardona Mr Cardona is keen to point out the financial significance of the donations applicants have made. These now total more than 220m euros and are worth about 2.5% of Malta's GDP. ""Because of their wealth and what they have done to achieve their status, they have quite a large footprint so we are able to do a lot of due diligence on them,"" he says. ""Other economic migrants, especially when they come without any documentation - we don't even know where they are coming from or the language they speak."" But for some, citizenship is about more than just numbers. ""A passport is something which should not be for sale, it's something you belong to, part of your DNA,"" says Helga Ellul, who was born in Germany but has lived in Malta for more than 40 years. She moved to the island to run German toymaker Playmobil's operations there, employing more than 1,000 workers. She married, had two children and now has three grandchildren, and 15 years ago she applied for and was granted Maltese citizenship, without handing over hundreds of thousands of euros. ""It wasn't an easy decision for me to give up my German passport,"" she adds. ""When I took the decision it was because I really felt I belong to this country, that I would remain here. I have so many more friends here, I'm so recognised here, and part of this whole society, and I think if you would ask people in Malta I think they would all say I earned it."" Helga Ellul gave up her German citizenship to become Maltese But what right can any of us really claim to citizenship? After all, most of us acquire it through our parents, by chance. Javier Hidalgo, a political theorist at the University of Richmond in Virginia, believes citizenship is always unearned and that there's often an inherent hypocrisy in a moral aversion to treating it as a commodity. ""If you're a sceptic about immigration restrictions, like me, then you'll be sceptical about selling citizenship, because you might think we're obligated to give people access to the country for free. ""But most countries and most people are quite happy to restrict immigration. If you think that's OK, then what's the problem with selling it? ""You're already in favour of excluding a lot of people. Why not make some money off of admitting some of them who you would otherwise be entitled to exclude?""

She says they've immersed themselves in Maltese life and have been welcomed by their new neighbours, making plenty of friends.

UK must keep 'half an eye' on EU rulings,"This video can not be played Why the fuss about the European Court of Justice? Theresa May has insisted the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in the UK will come to an end with Brexit. As the governmentpublished new details of its position,external, the PM said the UK would ""take back control of our laws"". But critics say it will be impossible to avoid European judges having a role in enforcing new agreements drawn up with the EU. Ministers say the two sides will keep ""half an eye"" on each other's rulings. Reality Check: What is the European Court of Justice? UK seeks 'close co-operation' on legal disputes The ECJ is in charge of ensuring member states abide by EU law. Its rulings are binding on all member states, and it also settles disputes between countries and EU institutions. In its new policy paper, the government: Does not rule out ECJ keeping its jurisdiction during the Brexit transition period that is planned after March 2019 Promises to work with the EU on the ""arrangements for judicial supervision"" during this period Makes clear that the rights of EU citizens living in the UK after Brexit will only be subject to British law - a sticking point in the negotiations with the EU Says giving the ECJ authority over UK-EU disputes would be unprecedented and not ""fair and neutral"" The promise to end ""direct jurisdiction"" in recent policy papers - a phrase not used by Mrs May - has raised questions about what ""indirect"" jurisdiction the EU court could be left with. In the latest publication, about how to enforce disputes after Brexit, the government has outlined several models used by other countries that it says show there is no need for the ECJ to be the final arbiter. But some of these involve the ECJ having an influence on the outcome of disputes, for example by interpreting EU law in a way that binds a disputes panel, or for its past rulings to be taken into account. Today's paper does not pin the government's colours to any particular mast. It throws out a number of possible models for how a trade agreement with the EU would work in terms of resolving disputes. All of the models make it clear that the ECJ will no longer have sole jurisdiction over disputes. The key question is how much influence the ECJ would retain under a bilateral agreement with the UK. The EU will not sign up to an agreement which allows to UK to depart from EU law to the UK's advantage and the EU's disadvantage on things like state aid to companies, or emissions standards. It will want a level playing field in trade and that will mean a lot of EU law as part of the agreement. The reality is that the more closely the Brexit trade agreement replicates EU law, the greater the influence of the ECJ will be. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the government was ""clearly backtracking on its earlier red lines and saying there has to be some form of dispute resolution through some form of judicial process"". He added: ""We have said that all along."" Asked if Labour would vote against the government's key piece of Brexit legislation, the repeal bill, when MPs returned from their summer break, Mr Corbyn said: ""We will make that decision just before the vote."" The pro-EU Open Britain campaign group said the government's policy paper was a ""climbdown camouflaged in jingoistic rhetoric"". The group called it ""frustratingly vague"", adding that in almost every example it provides, the ECJ would have ""substantial direct or indirect power over the proposed new relationship between Britain and the EU"". The government said it was not committing to following any of the arrangements set out, ruling out an ""off the shelf"" model. And sources played down the significance of the word ""direct"", saying it meant ECJ rulings would no longer automatically apply to the UK and that the court would no longer be able to strike down domestic UK laws. This video can not be played John Redwood and Chuka Umunna clash over ECJ Asked about her government's position, Mrs May said: ""What we will be able to do is to make our own laws - Parliament will make our laws - it is British judges that will interpret those laws, and it will be the British Supreme Court that will be the ultimate arbiter of those laws."" Earlier Justice Minister Dominic Raab said there would be ""divergence"" between UK and EU case law after Brexit, adding: ""It is precisely because there will be that divergence as we take back control that it makes sense for the UK to keep half an eye on the case law of the EU, and for the EU to keep half an eye on the case law of the UK."" In response, Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament's lead negotiator, tweeted that the ECJ had to ""keep both eyes open"" to protect citizens' rights. The ECJ's remit extends into many of the areas where the UK is hoping to draw up new arrangements with the EU, including trade and citizens' rights. Mr Raab said ""some form of arbitration"" would be needed, but that this would not be akin to a European court. Arbitration is where disputes are settled by a neutral third party. The UK and the EU could each appoint arbitrators and agree on a third, Mr Raab suggested. Decides whether the institutions of the EU are acting legally, and settles disputes between them Ensures that the member states of the EU are complying with their legal obligations as set out in the EU treaties; and allows member states to challenge EU legislation Interprets EU law at the request of national courts The SNP said the government had accepted the UK must continue to take account of judgements from the ECJ so it now needed to ""ditch their previous so-called red lines to ensure a deal can be found"". SNP External Affairs Secretary Fiona Hyslop said the best option for Scotland and the rest of the UK was to stay in the EU single market. Liberal Democrat leader Vince Cable said Mrs May's ""red lines are becoming more blurred by the day"", saying the ECJ had ""served Britain's interests well"" and should not be ""trashed"". The European Commission, which is leading the negotiations for the EU, did not comment in response to the government's publication.

"Vaginal seeding 'risky', warn doctors","New mothers should not embrace the trend of ""seeding"" their babies with vaginal bacteria, say doctors. It exposes children born by Caesarean section to bacteria that could have coated their bodies if they had been born vaginally. The idea is bacteria help train the immune system and lower the risk of allergies and asthma. But doctors in Denmark and the UK said there was too little evidence and it may be doing more harm than good. Being born by Caesarean section is linked to ahigher risk of some immune-based diseases,external. And there is growing medical interest in the role of the microbiome - the micro-organisms that call our bodies home - in preventing disease. Seeding involves taking a swab of vaginal fluid and rubbing it into the newborn's face, skin and eyes. A report,published in BJOG: An International Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology,external, said more than 90% of Danish obstetricians had said they had been asked about vaginal seeding. It said there was no evidence of any benefit to seeding as there was only one proper study of the technique and it involved just four babies. Parkinson's disease 'may start in gut' Which foods can improve your gut bacteria? However, it warned of clear risks to the baby, including infections such as group-B streptococcus,E. coliand a range of sexually transmitted infections. Dr Tine Clausen, the report author and a consultant at Nordsjaellands Hospital in Denmark, said: ""We know that women and their partners are increasingly speaking to their doctors about vaginal seeding."" She told the BBC News website: ""I really understand, it's a fascinating thought that you're able to mimic nature by doing the seeding, but it's based on some theoretical thoughts and we don't have evidence to support it."" Dr Clausen said a swab may not contain the same bacteria as those transferred during a vaginal birth and any bacteria were more diluted because of blood and amniotic fluid in the vaginal tract during labour. Her advice to women is to ""avoid unnecessary [Caesarean] sections, aim for breast feeding for at least half a year and to have early skin-to-skin contact"". Each of which does have a beneficial impact on a child's microbiome. In the UK, about a quarter of babies are born via Caesarean section Dr Patrick O'Brien, from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, said: ""There is no robust evidence to suggest that vaginal seeding has any associated benefits. ""We would therefore not recommend it until more definitive research shows that it is not harmful and can in fact improve a child's digestive and/or immune system."" Follow Jameson Twitter,external.

How bad is the household bill squeeze?,"Household bills are rising more slowly than the rate of inflation, new research has found. The figures suggested that key elements of the ""cost of living squeeze"" may be less severe than previously thought. Research byMoneySavingExpert,external, based on official data, revealed the rise in the total cost of household bills was less than the inflation rate. It found costs including rent, energy bills, council tax and insurance have risen by 2.1% in the past year. That rise is in line with average earnings growth and lower than the2.6% rise in the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) in July. CPIH, a measure of inflation that includes housing costs and council tax, also rose by 2.6% over the period. Although the numbers show only a small increase across household running costs as a whole, they also revealed large price hikes for electricity and insurance in particular. The cost of insurance rose by 7.6% over the year, including a 12% jump in car insurance premiums. Energy bills went up 5.1%, including a 9% increase for electricity. The data was compiled beforeBritish Gas announced a 12.5% price hikeon 1 August. Council tax rose by an average of 3.8%, the data showed, while rents went up by 1%. However, some other bills may have fallen over the last year, with a modest 1.2% fall for mobile phone bills and a 1% decline for other financial services. MoneySavingExpert managing editor Guy Anker said consumers could save considerable amounts by switching providers. Household bills inflation over the last 12 months peaked in February at 3.2%, but has been falling since then. How to switch energy supplier CPI inflation hit a 12-month peak of 2.9% in May before falling back, but remains above the Bank of England's 2% target. In its quarterly Inflation Report earlier this month, the Bank said higher import prices caused by the weaker pound have contributed to higher inflation, but that it expected inflation to ease back towards the target next year. Meanwhile, wage growth is not quite keeping pace with consumer prices, as average weekly earnings rose 2.1% in the three months to June, according to the Office for National Statistics. This means wages are falling in real terms. But this data, compiled for BBC Radio 5 Live's Wake up to Money, shows that the widely reported pressure on household budgets may in fact be overblown. Following the EU referendum last June, Bank of England Governor, Mark Carney, said the financial crisis had had a psychological impact on consumers, meaning the perception of hardship continues ""long after the original trigger becomes remote"". If you're cutting back on your holiday abroad, as one mum at a play centre in Manchester told us she was doing, then the household bill squeeze is clearly not just in your head. But what is behind us needing to tighten our belts is not so clear cut. This research on household bills is a reminder that, despite us talking each month about the official figure for overall price rises, our own personal budgets vary considerably. Wake Up to Money listeners this morning highlighted higher commuting costs and more requests from their kids' schools to pay for extras as just two other items putting pressure on pay packets. But others with different lives saw free travel (for pensioners) and lower petrol costs helping their cash go a little further than before. None of which comes under household bills, but all of which are crucial costs each month.

"'Merit' in women-only carriages, says MP","Women-only train carriages could combat the rise in sexual offences on public transport, a Labour MP has said. Shadow fire minister Chris Williamson said it would be ""worth consulting"" on the policy after such crimes doubled in the past five years. However, Labour colleagues have criticised the move as ""normalising attacks"". Party leader Jeremy Corbynfirst suggested the policyduring his leadership election campaign in 2015. Mr Williamson, MP for Derby North, highlightedfigures from the British Transport Police,showing 1,448 sexual offences on trains had been reported in 2016-17, compared with 650 incidents in 2012-13. He toldPoliticsHome,externalthat women-only carriages - which have been tested in countries including Japan, Brazil and Mexico - could create a ""safe space"". Does UK need women-only rail carriages? Life in the women-only train carriage Women abused on London transport Later, he told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire show: ""I'm not saying we should go down this road at all, I'm merely suggesting that we consult on it. ""If there is support for it, then providing an additional carriage to provide that safe space for people if they wanted it, offering that choice I think is worth looking at."" He told the programme there was a ""clear need"" for better security and more guards to tackle the problem, but that gender-specific trains could be an ""idea worth exploring"". But he agreed there was a need to ""push for behaviour change"" so that ""everybody can travel on public transport in complete safety"". TheUK has seen these types of carriages before. Dating from as far back as the 1840s, British Rail had ladies-only compartments to protect women from public and verbal harassment. About 100 still existed on services between London and Essex when the decision was made to phase them out altogether in 1977. Ladies' Special trains started in Mumbai but gender-specific services now run across India Earlier this year, the Ladies' Special train in Mumbai, India, marked 25 years since its first journey. The Mumbai service - since copied in other cities around India - is exclusively for women and runs alongside gender-specific carriages on other services. Commuters shared their stories of the Ladies Special train with the BBC in anarticle from 2009,external. Sangeeta spoke of women being harassed by men often on other trains: ""They touch and pinchâ¦[but]â¦ here nobody passes lewd comments. ""Nobody teases us - it's great."" Student Charu Dua said: ""We can laugh, we can sit where we want, we can do whatever we want, we feel free. We can sing a song, as loud as we want."" But one man, Satya Pal, told the BBC the policy was ""not practical"", because it meant men had to travel separately from their wives, daughters or sisters. Laura Bates, from Everyday Sexism, a website which documents instances of daily sexism, told Victoria Derbyshire she would ""never suggest segregation is the answer"". ""It has to be about sending a clear message that this issue, which is already so normalised in our society, can be further normalised by the idea that women should simply go somewhere else."" The idea for women-only carriages was dropped by Mr Corbyn two years ago after fellow members of his party criticised it, including senior Labour MPs Yvette Cooper and Liz Kendall. And Mr Williamson's comments have again been attacked by colleagues. Walthamstow Labour MP Stella Creasytweeted,external: ""Can we make all carriages safe for all passengers rather than restricting where we can go? ""[It] doesn't keep women safe to restrict their movements - it normalises attacks. We need to be clear they [the attackers] are problem, not women's seating plans."" Allow Twitter content?

""And I doubt that many women would use them, so what you'd find is that the carriages would be empty.""

'Dragon's Den' for migrant entrepreneurs,"New arrivals in Europe are being encouraged to use their skills to become entrepreneurs An initiative is trying to turn Middle Eastern migrants in Europe into technology entrepreneurs. In the style of the BBC's international television series looking for new ideas and entrepreneurs, this is a kind of ""Dragon's Den for migrants"". After their pitches and interviews, the challenge has been won by five tech-savvy young people originally from Syria and Yemen who are now in the Netherlands. These young migrants say that surviving experiences such as the sea crossing into Europe has given them the type of risk-taking and nothing-to-lose mentality needed in business. The first successful entrants will take a six-month technology qualification before receiving 200,000 euros to launch and run Ngage Virtual Reality, a company that creates virtual reality content for education. The search for entrepreneurs, which will run each year, wants to tap into the energy and business ambitions of these new arrivals in Europe. The initiative has been devised by an organisation called R Ventures Capital. The corporate-sounding name is softened when you learn that the R stands for refugee. R Ventures Capital was founded Shantanu Prakash, an education technology entrepreneur from India, and social entrepreneur Archish Mittal. Mr Mittal says their main aim is to change perceptions of migrants to Europe from ""job stealers"" to ""job creators"". ""If the business is successful, it will generate many jobs for local people in the Netherlands,"" he says. ""We hope this changes the narrative around migrants and refugees and reminds people that they have skills which they want to use to help their new countries."" Mohammad Alkhateeb from Syria, founder Archish Mittal and Hasan Shahoud from Syria Mr Mittal is confident in the people he selected to run the new company because he thinks their difficult journeys to Europe have given them ""incredible drive and resilience"". One of those is Mohammad Alkhateeb, a 26-year-old graduate from the University of Damascus who left Syria in 2013. Mr Alkhateeb arrived in Europe after a three-day boat trip from Libya. Before that, he spent three weeks in Libya crammed alongside 40 other migrants in a smuggler's house. ""The journey has changed me more than I could imagine,"" he says. ""Now I know that I have nothing to lose, I just need to go for it and to jump into this project."" Mr Mittal says Mr Alkhateeb's hunger to succeed was evident at his interview. The project wants to create a new generation of entrepreneurs and job creators ""Mohammad has adapted to changing and very difficult circumstances, and this resilience and will to survive is one of the most important qualities an entrepreneur needs,"" he says. ""In business, you can have days when you are bankrupt, or circumstances mean you have to completely change your business idea, and you have no choice but to adapt. ""Mohammad has mastered this skill without needing to sign up for a course or go to business school."" Mr Alkhateeb says these ""survival skills"" are widely shared among other migrants. He has no shortage of role models of migrants who thrived in their new country - just look at Sergey Brin, Madeleine Albright and Albert Einstein.

Canadian universities School funding not always linked to results Ideas for theGlobal education series? Get in touch. Many tech founders and CEOs are migrants or the children of migrants. Sergey Brin of Google, Elon Musk of Tesla, Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Yahoo's Jerry Yang and eBay's Pierre Omidyar all had roots and connections outside of the US. The biological father of Apple's Steve Jobs was born in Homs, Syria. Alexis Ohanian, the son of an undocumented German immigrant and founder of Reddit, said that America's traditional openness to migrants has been its ""unfair advantage"". Many of the qualifications held by migrants are not being used in their jobs in the Netherlands Mr Mittal says Europe risks wasting its own advantage with the recent influx of migrants. He says many refugees bring skills which they cannot use in their new country. Mr Alkateeb says that his degree in business administration from the University of Damascus is worth ""zero"" in the eyes of prospective employers in Europe. ""People are not working in their fields,"" he says. ""I know a doctor from Syria who can only find work washing dishes in a restaurant. He offered to treat people for free but this was turned down by his municipality."" For more than a decade, the dragons have been looking for business ideas Martin Wyss, director of the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) in the Netherlands, says R Ventures Capital is ""a bold, daring and much needed experiment"". ""The public debate in the Netherlands on migrants integrating into the labour market has traditionally been quite black and white - some people are very welcoming, while others see newcomers as unwelcome competition in the labour market,"" he says. ""Job creation is still one of the main issues at the moment, so migrants who themselves are creating jobs are the best way to promote tolerance and acceptance of migrants."" So the IOM has worked with migrants, governmental and non-governmental partners, and employers across Europe to find how newcomers' existing qualifications and skills can be better validated in their new countries. This project is called Skills2Work. Within 10 years, R Ventures Capital aims to have founded multiple migrant-led companies across Europe, employing many Europeans. Despite their optimism, the failure rate of venture capital-backed start-ups around the world range from 75% to 95%. So what if this business fails? ""Even if we fail, the entrepreneurs will have gained a top-notch qualification from our partners Udacity, which will make them highly valuable in the job market in Europe,"" says Mr Mittal. ""They will have gained useful experience of starting a business and new networks. Professors and industry executives have agreed to visit the office in Amsterdam and mentor the team."" But most of all, he hopes to change some people's perceptions of migrants in Europe.

No 'direct jurisdiction' for EU court,"This video can not be played Why the fuss about the European Court of Justice? Theresa May has insisted the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in the UK will come to an end with Brexit. As the governmentpublished new details of its position,external, the PM said the UK would ""take back control of our laws"". But critics say it will be impossible to avoid European judges having a role in enforcing new agreements drawn up with the EU. Ministers say the two sides will keep ""half an eye"" on each other's rulings. Reality Check: What is the European Court of Justice? UK seeks 'close co-operation' on legal disputes The ECJ is in charge of ensuring member states abide by EU law. Its rulings are binding on all member states, and it also settles disputes between countries and EU institutions. In its new policy paper, the government: Does not rule out ECJ keeping its jurisdiction during the Brexit transition period that is planned after March 2019 Promises to work with the EU on the ""arrangements for judicial supervision"" during this period Makes clear that the rights of EU citizens living in the UK after Brexit will only be subject to British law - a sticking point in the negotiations with the EU Says giving the ECJ authority over UK-EU disputes would be unprecedented and not ""fair and neutral"" The promise to end ""direct jurisdiction"" in recent policy papers - a phrase not used by Mrs May - has raised questions about what ""indirect"" jurisdiction the EU court could be left with. In the latest publication, about how to enforce disputes after Brexit, the government has outlined several models used by other countries that it says show there is no need for the ECJ to be the final arbiter. But some of these involve the ECJ having an influence on the outcome of disputes, for example by interpreting EU law in a way that binds a disputes panel, or for its past rulings to be taken into account. Today's paper does not pin the government's colours to any particular mast. It throws out a number of possible models for how a trade agreement with the EU would work in terms of resolving disputes. All of the models make it clear that the ECJ will no longer have sole jurisdiction over disputes. The key question is how much influence the ECJ would retain under a bilateral agreement with the UK. The EU will not sign up to an agreement which allows to UK to depart from EU law to the UK's advantage and the EU's disadvantage on things like state aid to companies, or emissions standards. It will want a level playing field in trade and that will mean a lot of EU law as part of the agreement. The reality is that the more closely the Brexit trade agreement replicates EU law, the greater the influence of the ECJ will be. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the government was ""clearly backtracking on its earlier red lines and saying there has to be some form of dispute resolution through some form of judicial process"". He added: ""We have said that all along."" Asked if Labour would vote against the government's key piece of Brexit legislation, the repeal bill, when MPs returned from their summer break, Mr Corbyn said: ""We will make that decision just before the vote."" The pro-EU Open Britain campaign group said the government's policy paper was a ""climbdown camouflaged in jingoistic rhetoric"". The group called it ""frustratingly vague"", adding that in almost every example it provides, the ECJ would have ""substantial direct or indirect power over the proposed new relationship between Britain and the EU"". The government said it was not committing to following any of the arrangements set out, ruling out an ""off the shelf"" model. And sources played down the significance of the word ""direct"", saying it meant ECJ rulings would no longer automatically apply to the UK and that the court would no longer be able to strike down domestic UK laws. This video can not be played John Redwood and Chuka Umunna clash over ECJ Asked about her government's position, Mrs May said: ""What we will be able to do is to make our own laws - Parliament will make our laws - it is British judges that will interpret those laws, and it will be the British Supreme Court that will be the ultimate arbiter of those laws."" Earlier Justice Minister Dominic Raab said there would be ""divergence"" between UK and EU case law after Brexit, adding: ""It is precisely because there will be that divergence as we take back control that it makes sense for the UK to keep half an eye on the case law of the EU, and for the EU to keep half an eye on the case law of the UK."" In response, Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament's lead negotiator, tweeted that the ECJ had to ""keep both eyes open"" to protect citizens' rights. The ECJ's remit extends into many of the areas where the UK is hoping to draw up new arrangements with the EU, including trade and citizens' rights. Mr Raab said ""some form of arbitration"" would be needed, but that this would not be akin to a European court. Arbitration is where disputes are settled by a neutral third party. The UK and the EU could each appoint arbitrators and agree on a third, Mr Raab suggested. Decides whether the institutions of the EU are acting legally, and settles disputes between them Ensures that the member states of the EU are complying with their legal obligations as set out in the EU treaties; and allows member states to challenge EU legislation Interprets EU law at the request of national courts The SNP said the government had accepted the UK must continue to take account of judgements from the ECJ so it now needed to ""ditch their previous so-called red lines to ensure a deal can be found"". SNP External Affairs Secretary Fiona Hyslop said the best option for Scotland and the rest of the UK was to stay in the EU single market. Liberal Democrat leader Vince Cable said Mrs May's ""red lines are becoming more blurred by the day"", saying the ECJ had ""served Britain's interests well"" and should not be ""trashed"". The European Commission, which is leading the negotiations for the EU, did not comment in response to the government's publication.

Feeling squeezed? You may be imagining it,"Household bills are rising more slowly than the rate of inflation, new research has found. The figures suggested that key elements of the ""cost of living squeeze"" may be less severe than previously thought. Research byMoneySavingExpert,external, based on official data, revealed the rise in the total cost of household bills was less than the inflation rate. It found costs including rent, energy bills, council tax and insurance have risen by 2.1% in the past year. That rise is in line with average earnings growth and lower than the2.6% rise in the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) in July. CPIH, a measure of inflation that includes housing costs and council tax, also rose by 2.6% over the period. Although the numbers show only a small increase across household running costs as a whole, they also revealed large price hikes for electricity and insurance in particular. The cost of insurance rose by 7.6% over the year, including a 12% jump in car insurance premiums. Energy bills went up 5.1%, including a 9% increase for electricity. The data was compiled beforeBritish Gas announced a 12.5% price hikeon 1 August. Council tax rose by an average of 3.8%, the data showed, while rents went up by 1%. However, some other bills may have fallen over the last year, with a modest 1.2% fall for mobile phone bills and a 1% decline for other financial services. MoneySavingExpert managing editor Guy Anker said consumers could save considerable amounts by switching providers. Household bills inflation over the last 12 months peaked in February at 3.2%, but has been falling since then. How to switch energy supplier CPI inflation hit a 12-month peak of 2.9% in May before falling back, but remains above the Bank of England's 2% target. In its quarterly Inflation Report earlier this month, the Bank said higher import prices caused by the weaker pound have contributed to higher inflation, but that it expected inflation to ease back towards the target next year. Meanwhile, wage growth is not quite keeping pace with consumer prices, as average weekly earnings rose 2.1% in the three months to June, according to the Office for National Statistics. This means wages are falling in real terms. But this data, compiled for BBC Radio 5 Live's Wake up to Money, shows that the widely reported pressure on household budgets may in fact be overblown. Following the EU referendum last June, Bank of England Governor, Mark Carney, said the financial crisis had had a psychological impact on consumers, meaning the perception of hardship continues ""long after the original trigger becomes remote"". If you're cutting back on your holiday abroad, as one mum at a play centre in Manchester told us she was doing, then the household bill squeeze is clearly not just in your head. But what is behind us needing to tighten our belts is not so clear cut. This research on household bills is a reminder that, despite us talking each month about the official figure for overall price rises, our own personal budgets vary considerably. Wake Up to Money listeners this morning highlighted higher commuting costs and more requests from their kids' schools to pay for extras as just two other items putting pressure on pay packets. But others with different lives saw free travel (for pensioners) and lower petrol costs helping their cash go a little further than before. None of which comes under household bills, but all of which are crucial costs each month.

Trump: 'I'll close government' to build wall,"This video can not be played Donald Trump defends his Charlottesville response, but cuts out a key part Donald Trump says he will close down the US government if necessary to build his wall along the Mexico border. The president told supporters at a ""Make America Great Again"" rally in Phoenix, Arizona, that the opposition Democrats were being ""obstructionist"". During the 80-minute speech, he also took aim at the media, blaming them for giving far right groups ""a platform"". But he selectively quoted his initial response to violence at a far-right rally that left one woman dead. He omitted the much-criticised claim that""many sides"" had to shoulder the blamefor violence in Charlottesville, Virginia. President Trump wants Congress to finance his controversial plan to build a ""big, beautiful"" wall along the United States' border with Mexico to keep out illegal immigrants. But Republicans will need the support of Democrats to secure funding for the wall in a government spending bill, which they are unlikely to get. In his speech, Mr Trump said the Democrats were ""putting all of America's safety at risk"" by opposing the wall. He said immigration officers who worked in the area said it was ""vital"" to stem the flow of illegal immigrants. Six things that could topple Trump's wall What Trump's rally taught us He said that, if it came to it, he would risk a government shutdown - which is what happens when legislation funding the federal government cannot be passed by Congress and non-essential services stop. ""Now the obstructionist Democrats would like us not to do it, but believe me if we have to close down our government, we are building that wall,"" Mr Trump said, adding that ""the American people voted for immigration control"". If President Trump wants a government shutdown all he has to do is refuse to sign a funding bill sent to him by Congress. Capitol Hill is set to debate a new budget measure this autumn, and unless it is passed federal operations will be in limbo by 1 October. By James Cook, BBC North America correspondent, Phoenix The president is struggling to realise his central campaign pledge to build a wall on the Mexican border Donald Trump's signature campaign promise - to ""build that wall"" - epitomised his appeal to the nation, an apparently simple solution to a problem freighted with racial and economic undertones. Not only that but it would be free! Mexico would pay, as Mr Trump and his cheering crowds repeatedly insisted. But it turns out that governing is harder than campaigning. Construction of prototypes near San Diego in California - which had been scheduled for this summer - has been delayed until at least December by a legal challenge from one rejected bidder. Ranchers, environmentalists and some businesses on the border have raised objections to the plan, while one Republican congressman in Texas, Will Hurd, has even described the wall as the most expensive and least effective way to secure the border. Mexico, needless to say, is not keen to write a cheque. Faced with the need to win over doubters on the detail, and explain why this would be a lot of money well spent, Mr Trump has instead chosen to raise the stakes with an ""all or nothing"" approach. This should not come as a surprise. President Trump attacked the media in the campaign-style speech, saying reporters had misrepresented his ""perfect"" words in the wake of the violence in Charlottesville, where Heather Heyer was killed after a car ploughed into a crowd of people protesting against far-right demonstrators including neo-Nazis. He accused ""truly dishonest people in the media and the fake media"" of ""trying to take away our history and heritage"" because, he said, they ""don't like our country"". What made Trump remarks so offensive? He quoted his first public response to the violence on 12 August, which was criticised by both Republicans and Democratsfor not explicitly condemning the far-right. ""This is what I said on Saturday: 'We're closely following the terrible events unfolding in Charlottesville, Virginia,' - this is me speaking. 'We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence.' That's me speaking on Saturday, right after the event,"" he said. This video can not be played Police pepper spray protesters outside the Trump rally But his full quote was: ""We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides, on many sides."" Separately, the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination has criticised the US for what it said was a ""failure at the highest political level"" to reject ""racist violent events"". Referring to Charlottesville,the committee said,externalit was issuing a rare ""early warning"", which has been used in recent years in countries including Burundi, Iraq, Nigeria and the Ivory Coast. Nafta:The US, Mexico and Canada have begun talks on revising their trade deal, and negotiators are due to meet again on 1 September. But Mr Trump said he thought he would ""probably end up terminating Nafta"" North Korea:He sounded hopeful about a reduction in tensions. Referring to North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, Mr Trump said: ""I respect the fact that he is starting to respect us."" He added: ""And maybe - probably not, but maybe - something positive can come about"" Sheriff Joe Arpaio:The US president hinted he would pardon the controversial former Arizona sheriff, who rose to national prominence because of his tough stance against illegal immigration. He said that Joe Arpaio - who wasfound guilty of criminal contemptin July over his detention of migrants - ""is going to be just fine"", but he would not yet formally pardon him because ""I don't want to cause any controversy"" Responding to the speech, the former National Intelligence director James Clappertold CNN,externalthat he was questioning Donald Trump's ""fitness"" for office. ""I also am beginning to wonder about his motivation for it,"" he said, adding he found the rally ""downright scary and disturbing"". Ruben Gallego, a Democratic Party congressman in Arizona, said it was the worst-ever speech by a US president. ""It was all about him, it was not about the country,"" he told the BBC. A former British ambassador to the US, Peter Westmacott, said he saw parallels with the establishment of Nazi Germany in 1933. Allow Twitter content?

Employers fret about state of UK economy,"UK employers are growing increasingly worried about the economy, new research has found. A survey of 601 employers by the Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC) found 31% expect the economy to worsen, with only 28% expecting it to improve. Employers' confidence has worsened since the last survey in July. REC chief Kevin Green said the decline should ""raise a red flag"" and called for greater clarity over Brexit. ""The jobs market continues to do well despite growing uncertainty,"" he said. ""Businesses are continuing to hire to meet demand, but issues like access to labour, Brexit negotiations and political uncertainty are creating nervousness."" The REC's measure of confidence has turned negative in the space of a month. In July the number of those employers who felt confident about the economy outweighed the pessimists by 6 percentage points. The fall is matched by declining consumer confidence. In June the market research group GfK's consumer confidence index fell to the level last seen in the immediate aftermath of the Brexit vote. The REC's JobsOutlook survey showed that 40% of employers had no spare capacity and one in five planned to take on more permanent staff to meet additional demand. It's getting harder to find skilled workers according to the REC However, their biggest problem was finding the right candidates, especially in the construction industry, for either temporary or permanent positions. Mr Green said: ""Employers in the construction sector are especially concerned as they rely heavily on EU workers to meet the growing demand for housing and to support the government's infrastructure plans. ""The added factor of dropping consumer confidence is putting some businesses on edge. If people reduce their spending, businesses will be impacted. ""The government must do more to create an environment where businesses have clarity. That means clearly laying out what Brexit plans look like and how employers can keep recruiting the people they need from the EU."" Labour MP Mary Creagh, part of the Open Britain campaign group, said the government's refusal to guarantee the rights of EU citizens living in the UK was damaging business confidence. ""To protect jobs and our economy, they need to give citizens and businesses certainty that all EU workers living in Britain will have their rights guaranteed, and that Brexit will not be used as an excuse for a self-defeating crackdown on immigration from Europe,"" she said. A government spokesperson said: ""We recognise and value the contribution that EU citizens make to the social, economic and cultural life of the UK and that's why last month we outlined our offer to protect the rights of EU citizens in the UK and UK nationals in the EU.""

North should 'take control' of transport,"The north of England's leaders should ""take control"" of their own transport networks, Chris Grayling has said. Writing in theYorkshire Post,external, the transport secretary said: ""The success of northern transport depends on the North itself."" The article comes ahead of a transport summit in the region to be attended by local leaders and businesses. But Liverpool regional mayor Steve Rotheram accused him of an ""abdication of responsibility"". He added: ""I would like to thank him for acting as a catalyst to get business leaders and political leaders so incensed and wound up that they now are speaking with one voice."" And Sheffield City Council leader Julie Dore said the remarks showed ""quite clearly his particular contempt for the North of England"". Osborne: May should commit to HS3 North of England 'needs transport investment now' The transport summit comes a day after former Chancellor George Osbornecalled for ""HS3"" high-speed rail linesbetween Liverpool and Hull. In the article, Mr Grayling said whilst one of his ""biggest priorities"" was to build transport links in the North, it was down to the region to design and manage them. He wrote:  ""It is central government's responsibility to provide funding and a delivery structure that ensures efficiency, value for money and accountability. ""But, beyond this, I want the North to take control."" The summit, being held in Leeds on Wednesday, has been described by organisers as an ""unprecedented gathering"" of leaders from councils and businesses who want more investment in local infrastructure. It follows the announcement from the government last month that it wasscrapping the planned electrification of railway linesin Wales, the Midlands and the north of England. Days later, Mr Grayling thenbacked proposals for Crossrail 2- a new line linking north-east and south-west London. Leeds will be one of the two northern terminuses of the HS2 high-speed link Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham said the government needed to do more for the region. ""We are getting organised and demanding the government keeps all of its promises to people here and delivers a fair funding deal for the north of England,"" he said. ""We are not against our capital city developing world-class infrastructure, but it cannot be at the expense of the North. ""People here have put up with clapped-out trains and congested roads for long enough."" Leader of Leeds City Council Judith Blake added: ""The people of the North are demanding a direct commitment from the government to increase investment in transport and to settle for any less would hold back the potential of the North for decades to come."" But Transport Minister Paul Maynard said funding had been provided for the development of detailed proposals for transport upgrades which the government could invest in. He said: ""I keep hearing demands for investment in the North but I should point out they come from some of the very same people who we have asked to help develop plans. ""We all want to improve rail in the North and we are all getting on with the work that needs to be done.""

Rotherham whistleblower case 'examined',"Jayne Senior was a key figure in exposing the extent of child sexual abuse taking place in Rotherham The handling of an investigation into the woman who first revealed the child sexual abuse scandal in Rotherham is to be examined, the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme has learned. Jayne Senior has been investigated by Rotherham Council for a year, after a number of complaints. It is understood the Local Government Ombudsman has now said it will look into her treatment. Rotherham Council said it had a duty to ensure complaints were considered. As a charity worker helping exploited teenagers, Mrs Senior helped reveal a pattern in the town that saw children groomed, raped and tortured by groups of men for more than a decade. The extent of the abuse was exposed three years ago in a report by Prof Alexis Jay, which said more than 1,400 children had been abused, with the police and council failing to act. Mrs Senior now works for a local charity called Swinton Lock. But for the past year has found herself under investigation by Rotherham Council. She is accused of making money from media appearances and of sharing information inappropriately, which she denies. It follows a complaint by some abuse victims, but Mrs Senior says she was given detailed allegations only last week, after the BBC contacted the council. ""I do not receive money from doing interviews,"" she says. ""The only interview I received a small amount of money for, [it] has gone to Swinton Lock. ""I don't and have not done this for money. ""Somebody told them I was earning a significant amount of money. Well, I'm not."" Speaking about it for the first time, to the Victoria Derbyshire programme, she says it has been a huge strain. ""Here we are nearly three years on, and I feel more vilified than some of the perpetrators in Rotherham,"" she says. Michael Fowler, a former detective who is on the management committee of the charity, said he had seen murder inquiries wrapped up in less time. ""They've done a lot of damage in that time, and they've been very inactive in that time,"" he said. ""It is just appalling the way we've been treated. ""We are a small charity, we are not major criminals. ""We have policies and procedures here to deal with allegations. ""They've deliberately bypassed those, even when we've asked them to stop. ""It just seems they want to attack Jayne's character and discredit the work she has done as a whistleblower."" The Local Government and Social Care Ombudsman - which is to assess the treatment of Mrs Senior - looks at complaints about councils, social care providers and some other organisations in England. It is the final stage of complaints against councils. A spokesman for Rotherham Council said it had received a number of complaints relating to Mrs Senior and the charity. ""We have a duty of care to ensure all complaints are robustly and fairly considered, in line with our complaints process. ""Independent investigators were appointed to review these complaints. ""This is ongoing, and, as such, we are unable to comment further at this stage."" Watch theVictoria Derbyshire programmeon weekdays between 09:00 and 11:00 on BBC Two and the BBC News channel.
