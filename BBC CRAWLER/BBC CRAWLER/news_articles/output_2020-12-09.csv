Vaccine documents hacked at EU medicines agency,"The European Medicines Agency (EMA) says it has been hit by a cyber-attack and documents relating to a Covid-19 vaccine have been accessed. BioNTech, which makes one of the vaccines in partnership with Pfizer, said its regulatory submission was accessed during the attack. The EMA is working on approval of two Covid-19 vaccines, which it expects to conclude within weeks. The cyber-attack was not expected to impact that timeline, BioNTech said. The EMA did not provide any details on the nature of the cyber-attack in a brief statement on its website, beyond saying a full investigation had been launched. A spokesperson for the agency said it was still ""functional"". But BioNTech,in a statement published on its website,external, said it had been told its documents had been accessed. ""Today, we were informed... that the agency has been subject to a cyber-attack and that some documents relating to the regulatory submission for Pfizer and BioNTech's Covid-19 vaccine candidate, BNT162b2, which has been stored on an EMA server, had been unlawfully accessed,"" it said. ""EMA has assured us that the cyber-attack will have no impact on the timeline for its review,"" it added. It said it had made the details of the hack public ""given the critical public health considerations and the importance of transparency"". And it also said it was ""unaware"" of any personal data of participants in its medical studies being compromised. The EMA authorises the use of medicines across the European Union. It is trying to decide if the Pfizer/BioNTech jab - which has just begun being rolled out in the UK - and another made by Moderna are safe for use in EU countries. It is not clear if the Moderna documents have also been accessed. The cyber-attack is the latest in a string of attacks and warnings about hacking threats against vaccine-makers and public health bodies. Allergy warning over Covid vaccine Rich countries 'hoarding Covid vaccines' The use of cyber-attacks against bodies involved in the vaccine rollout has been a feature of recent months. Security services warned in the summerthat Russian intelligence had been targeting organisationsattempting to develop a successful vaccine. In October,a pharmaceutical company based in Indiawas the victim of a significant cyber-attack. And in recent days, IBM saidthe cold storage supply chain used to transport viable vaccineshad come under cyber-attack - probably by a nation state. The cyber-attack comes the day before the agency is due to update the European Parliament on the progress of the vaccine assessments. Euro-MPs on the Public Health Committee are due to quiz the agency's executive director ""on how close the most advanced vaccines are to receiving authorisation"" on Thursday. The UK's National Cyber Security Centre, meanwhile, said there was no indication the cyber-attack would affect the rollout of the vaccine in the UK. ""We are working with international partners to understand the impact of this incident affecting the EU's medicine regulator, but there is currently no evidence to suggest that the UK's medicine regulator has been affected,"" it said.

Sky's Kay Burley off air over Covid breach,"Burley has been one of the faces of Sky News for more than 30 years Sky News presenter Kay Burley and three colleagues have been taken off air while an investigation into breaches of Covid guidelines is carried out. Political editor Beth Rigby, north of England correspondent Inzamam Rashid and presenter Sam Washington are also off air while the inquiry takes place. BBC media editor Amol Rajan said Burley's job is hanging in the balance. It follows her admission that she ""broke the rules"" while celebrating her 60th birthday at the weekend. The journalist said she could ""only apologise"" for her ""error of judgment"". Writing on Twitter on Monday,external, Burley said she had been at a ""Covid compliant"" restaurant on Saturday and had later ""popped into another"" venue to use the toilet. Amol Rajan said she was one of a party of 10 people at the Century Club, a private members' club on London's Shaftesbury Avenue. Her group took up two tables, with six people on one and four on the other. Burley then went onto Folie restaurant, where she used the toilet, before moving on to a private residence where individuals from at least three households mixed, Rajan said. ""This is a source of deep anxiety among Sky News bosses,"" Rajan said. ""There is fury within the Sky News newsroom at the compromising of the brand, especially after Sky News has had a strong year."" Rigby, Rashid and Washington are reported to have been present during the evening, although it's not known which parts they attended. Beth Rigby became Sky News political editor last year Burley was absent from her daily breakfast show on Tuesday and Wednesday, and fellow presenterNiall Paterson said,externalhe would be taking over her slot until Christmas. In a tweet that was subsequently deleted, Burley said she had always planned to take time off this month to visit her ""beloved Africa"". Sharing a video from a safari trip, she said she would be leaving on Friday to go ""sit with lions"", adding: ""They kill for food not sport."" Burley, who joined Sky News in 1988 and has hosted the breakfast show since October 2019, offered an apology to her 519,000 Twitter followers on Monday. ""On Saturday night I was enjoying my 60th birthday at a Covid compliant restaurant,"" she wrote. ""I am embarrassed to say that later in the evening I inadvertently broke the rules. ""I had been waiting for a taxi at 11pm to get home. Desperate for the loo I briefly popped into another restaurant to spend a penny. I can only apologise."" Allow Twitter content?

Allergy warning over Covid vaccine,"People with a history of significant allergic reactions should not have the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid jab, regulators say. It came after two NHS workers had allergic reactions on Tuesday. The advice applies to those who have had reactions to medicines, food or vaccines, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency said. The two people had a reaction shortly after having the new jab, had treatment and are both fine now. They are understood to have had an anaphylactoid reaction, which tends to involve a skin rash, breathlessness and sometimes a drop in blood pressure. This is not the same as anaphylaxis which can be fatal. Both NHS workers have a history of serious allergies and carry adrenaline pens around with them. How does the Pfizer vaccine work? What you need to know about vaccine safety When can you get the Covid vaccine? Professor Stephen Powis, medical director for the NHS in England, said both individuals were recovering well. He said this was ""common with new vaccines"", describing it as a precautionary measure. Dr June Raine, head of the MHRA, said it was only right to take this step now that ""we've had this experience"". Reactions like this are uncommon, but do happen with other vaccines, including the annual flu jab. Several thousand people were vaccinated on Tuesday in hospital clinics on the first day of the UK rollout of the new Covid jab. Prof Peter Openshaw, an expert in immunology at Imperial College London, said: ""The fact that we know so soon about these two allergic reactions and that the regulator has acted on this to issue precautionary advice shows that this monitoring system is working well."" This is a story to assess with your head and not your gut. No effective medicine is without side effects so you have to balance the risk and the benefit. Remember, one in a thousand of the entire UK population have died after being infected with coronavirus this year and that figure is rising daily. Two people, out of thousands vaccinated yesterday, had an allergic reaction which they recovered from. Such reactions can happen with any vaccine and are treated with drugs such as steroids or adrenaline. The trials reportedone possible allergic reaction,externalper thousand people immunised that may have been related to the jab. The MHRA has given targeted advice to those most at risk, but for the overwhelming majority of people, this changes nothing. More from James:What you need to know about vaccine safety The development came after the NHS has announced the vaccination programme will be expanded out to GP surgeries from next week. Doses are expected to be delivered to around 200 GP surgeries initially to allow them to start on Tuesday. The over-80s will be invited first. Once the first 200 GP practices have received their doses the programme will be expanded out to more than 1,000 surgeries - with each local area having a designated site. It means most patients will be invited to a GP centre that is not their usual one. Similar arrangements are being made in the rest of the UK. Dr Richard Vautrey, GP leader from the British Medical Association, said GPs were ""ready to go"". ""We have a wealth of experience in delivering vaccines - and will be able to do millions of people a week. It is really dependent on supply and how quickly we can get our hands on it."" Meanwhile, one of the key people behind another Covid vaccine developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca has played down fears the jab may not be effective in older people. Data published by the Lancet on Tuesdaysuggested there was a lack of certainty over the effectiveness of the vaccine in the over-55s. Prof Sarah Gilbert said older people were only recruited into the trials later in the process, and the next trial results provided were likely to include information about how well the jab worked in people over the age of 55. But she said there ""was no difference"" in the immune response seen in younger adults and people over 70 in earlier trials. This meant the regulator could support licensing of the vaccine to the elderly, she said. The MHRA is currently considering the Oxford University-Astra Zeneca jab. The vaccine is crucial to fast rollout as it is much easier to store and distribute, because it does not need to be kept at ultra-cold temperatures. There are more than 5 million doses of the vaccine currently in the country. The latestdaily figures for the UK,external, published on Wednesday, showed a further 533 people have now died within 28 days of a positive Covid-19 test. A further 16,578 people have tested positive for Covid-19, taking the UK's total cases to 1,766,819. All's well that ends well?

Hunter Biden under investigation over his taxes,"Joe Biden (right) is ""deeply proud"" of Hunter Biden (left), the president-elect's transition team says US President-elect Joe Biden's son Hunter has said his tax affairs are under investigation. The investigation is being conducted by federal prosecutors in Delaware. US media quote sources saying it relates to business dealings with foreign countries including China. Hunter Biden said he was confident he would be shown to have done no wrong. The Biden-Harris transition team said the president-elect was ""deeply proud of his son"". A statement from the team said Hunter had ""fought through difficult challenges, including the vicious personal attacks of recent months, only to emerge stronger"". The 50-year-old said he had learned of the investigation on Tuesday. He did not disclose any further details. ""I take this matter very seriously but I am confident that a professional and objective review of these matters will demonstrate that I handled my affairs legally and appropriately, including with the benefit of professional tax advisers,"" he said. What was Hunter Biden doing in Ukraine and China? Hunter Biden's Ukraine work 'problematic', says report Reports say the investigation was begun in 2018, before Joe Biden announced his bid for the presidency. Hunter Biden was a frequent target of Republican criticism during the 2020 election campaign, focusing on his business dealings in Ukraine and China when Joe Biden was vice-president in the Barack Obama administration. Last December, President Donald Trump was impeached by the Democratic-run House of Representatives on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress stemming from his attempts to pressure Ukraine to investigate the Bidens. But Mr Trump was cleared by the Republican-held Senate in February. The new investigation into Hunter Biden's tax affairs comes as his father assembles his cabinet. If the case is still ongoing when Mr Biden is sworn into office next month, his pick for attorney general could have oversight of the investigation, AP notes. The presidential election is over, but it seems President-elect Joe Biden's son Hunter - a regular target of Republican attacks during the campaign - is going to stay in the news. The revelation that Hunter is under tax investigation is not entirely surprising. There have been hints of such an inquiry for months. With official confirmation, however, comes further scrutiny - and potential political headaches for the president-elect. If Republicans maintain control of the US Senate, hearings into Hunter's finances - and any ties to President Biden - are a foregone conclusion. And if the investigation turns into formal charges, political concerns for the Biden family could turn into very real legal ones. While Donald Trump's critics will be quick to accuse the outgoing president of orchestrating this investigation as political reprisal, the US attorney behind it - David Weiss of Delaware - is a veteran prosecutor. Although he was appointed by the current president, Weiss also worked as a deputy in the office, and as interim US attorney, during Democrat Barack Obama's presidency. Hunter Biden, in a statement, says he acted ""legally and appropriately"". If so, this matter will eventually fade from view. Being under the federal criminal microscope, however, is never a pleasant affair.

Will Brexit dinner prove to be the last supper?,"Could it be the last supper? Boris Johnson will travel to Brussels for the first time in months on Wednesday night to sit and break bread with the EU Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen. It is more than a standard diplomatic dinner. It is possible that the encounter could be the moment at which the UK and the EU conclude that there cannot be a trade deal now, and that after decades of political and economic ties, efforts to say a polite political farewell have failed, with all theconsequences that might entail. The purpose of the dinner however is not to call a halt. But nor is the purpose to proclaim that a deal's been done. What you need to know about Brexit What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? PM heads to Brussels on Wednesday for Brexit talks The reason for the meeting is to see if both sides are willing in principle to tolerate the notion of budging, after the negotiations, and frankly negotiators, have been exhausted. If the prime minister and Mrs von der Leyen can look each other in the eye and agree that there are still compromises to be had, then a deal is still possible. If they are willing to make that kind of pact - to say privately to each other, I'm willing to budge if you are too - then that would in theory allow technical talks to get going again. This wouldn't be any kind of changes to the formal mandates - the boundaries the negotiators have been set. But it could reset the dial, sending Lord Frost and Michel Barnier back to the table in the understanding that their political bosses might just be a touch more wiling to be flexible after all. TRAVEL RULES: How your holidays will change in 2021 NO DEAL YET: What are the sticking points in trade talks? BREXIT: Seven things that will change on 1 January In turn, that doesn't mean that a deal is going to be achieved. But it could tip the balance back towards the overall political imperatives of making this happen, and away from both sides' commitment to stick so closely to their principles. Here, the government's actions on the Northern Ireland protocol on Tuesday are a hint that they just might be willing to bend a little further. Equally however,settling the joint protocolmakes it easier for the government to minimise disruption if it walks away. So beware wise sages claiming it's definitive proof either way! Don't forget too, it's only this time last week that there was a sense we were moving towards a conclusion on both sides. But that was before some member states, with France as the hard man, toughened their approach, surprising the UK and setting the process back - although any change is still denied officially by the EU side. What we just can't know, however, is whether the leaders will be able to find common cause when they meet on Wednesday. There has been a real sense of ""you first"" in the last 24 hours, with both sides waiting to see what the other's next move would be. If there is a chance that a deal can be done, tomorrow night's dinner needs to produce at the very least a metaphorical statement of intent. But if the two leaders just aren't prepared to make a leap, it could yet be the last supper after all. P.S. It's interesting to note that when Theresa May was trying to manage these processes, she sometimes dashed off to see the individual leaders of the member states, or held phone calls with them, as did Boris Johnson sometimes. There was one notable explosion with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on a call last year, which now seems a century ago. It's understood that this time Boris Johnson's team was interested in the possibility of talking to Mrs Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron in these vital few days themselves. But I'm told the EU wanted to keep everything channelled through one point of contact. Downing Street has denied the suggestion this afternoon that he wanted them to be on the call when he rang Mrs von der Leyen on Monday. But it seems there have been discussions about whether to have those separate discussions that have then not (so far) taken place. What does Australia have to do with Brexit?

Man gets vaccine days after wife's Covid-19 death,"Mrs Whitehead died at a care home just days before her husband received the vaccine A man has been given the Covid vaccine, days after his wife died after contracting the virus. Rae Whitehead, 79, died on 1 December after testing positive for Covid-19 at her care home in East Yorkshire. On Tuesday her husband Edward, 84, was one of the first to receive the jab at Middlesbrough's James Cook Hospital. The couple's surgeon son Dr David Whitehead, 49, said he felt relief his father had had the jab but ""heartbreak"" his mother could not be saved. Mr Whitehead, 49, an ENT consultant in Middlesbrough, who also received the jab with his father, who is also a retired ENT surgeon, said: ""It's heartbreaking on the one hand and also potential relief on the other. ""My father and I are deeply saddened that, had we not put my mother in a nursing home, she would maybe be alive today and could have had the vaccine. ""Her life slipped away - a week later the vaccine is being rolled out."" Edward Whitehead, 84, received the coronavirus vaccine at James Cook University Hospital Dr Whitehead said his mother, who had worked as a civil servant before having children, had spent her life ""looking after us and the family"". He said he had contracted coronavirus himself in March, and had a temperature and a ""sensation as if my head was being boiled alive"". He said the NHS rollout of the vaccine had made him proud. ""This is the good thing about the NHS - because it's nationalised we have this ability and power to have these interactions with the large pharmaceutical companies so that this sort of thing can happen,"" he said. ""I feel quite proud that we've managed to approve it, a vaccine from a trial, so quickly."" On Tuesday UK grandmother Margaret Keenan, who turns 91 next week,became the first person in the world to be given the Pfizer Covid-19 jabas part of a mass vaccination programme.

"Canada joins UK in approving Pfizer Covid vaccineThe country has 14 distribution sites with the cold storage needed for the vaccine, officials say.US & Canada","The vaccine is already being rolled out in the UK Canada's health regulator has approved the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine, the day after the UK became the first country in the world to roll it out. Health Canada called the authorisation a ""milestone"" in the country's fight against coronavirus. The agency said the vaccine met its ""stringent safety, efficacy and quality requirements"". Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says Canada is set to receive up to 249,000 doses of the vaccine this month. In total, the Canadian government has purchased 20 million doses of the vaccine - enough to inoculate 10 million people - with the option to buy 56 million more. On Tuesday,a UK grandmother was the first person in the world to be given the jab as part of a mass vaccination programme. This video can not be played Margaret Keenan was given the vaccine by May Parsons, at University Hospital in Coventry Bahrain has also approved the emergency use of the vaccine. US regulators haveconfirmed the vaccine is 95% effective,paving the way for it to be approved for emergency use there. Advisers to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are set to meet on Thursday to formally review whether the US should authorise its use. Health Canada said it approved the vaccine on Wednesday ""after a thorough, independent review of the evidence"". The announcement clears the way for doses to be delivered and administered across the country. Officials say Canada has 14 distribution sites equipped with the necessary cold storage for the vaccine. How does the Pfizer vaccine work? What you need to know about vaccine safety Will countries be left behind in the vaccine race? Healthcare workers and vulnerable groups, such as the elderly, will be among the first to receive it. The vaccine has initially been authorised for use on people aged 16 and over. Pfizer Canada said the approval marked ""a historic step forward in our efforts to reduce the number of Canadians suffering from this devastating virus"". Ontario Premier Doug Ford reacted to the news on Twitter, saying the province would be ready to deliver and administer doses ""as soon as vaccines arrive on Ontario soil"". ""Friends, the light at the end of the tunnel grows brighter,"" he wrote. Earlier on Wednesday, British regulators saidpeople with a history of significant allergic reactions should not have the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid jab, after two NHS workers had allergic reactions. The advice applies to those who have had reactions to medicines, food or vaccines. Professor Stephen Powis, medical director for the NHS in England, said this was ""common with new vaccines"", describing it as a precautionary measure. Health Canada officials told reporters they were only advising people with allergies to any of the ingredients in the vaccine to avoid it. They said they would monitor developments in the UK and decide whether to expand that guidance. Canada also has contracts with several other vaccine manufacturers. Mr Trudeau has said most Canadians should be vaccinated by September 2021. The People's Vaccine Alliance - a network of organisations including Amnesty International, Oxfam and Global Justice Now - claims Canada has ordered enough vaccines to protect each Canadian five times, if all the vaccines are approved for use. The group has accused rich countries of hoarding doses, andsays poor countries are set to miss out. How does the Pfizer vaccine work?

Brexit 'could see people choose cheddar over brie',"Brits could turn back to cheddar if the price of French cheese shoots up after a no-deal Brexit. Tesco's chair John Allan told the BBC that import taxes could push up the price of brie by as much as 40%. He said it might ""change the mix of what people eat"", leading to people buying more British cheddar. He added food bills could climb by 5% on average in the event of a no-deal Brexit, with some products increasing even more. He warned consumers could face some disruption to supplies while the industry adjusted to the new situation next year. Earlier, Mr Allen said the grocer had been stockpiling some non-fresh food as it prepares for potential shortages. Last ditch trade talks between the UK and EUended without agreement on Wednesday evening when Prime Minister Boris Johnson met in Brussels with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. Time is running out to reach a deal before 31 December, when the UK stops following EU trading rules. Mr Allen forecast that without a deal food inflation would climb between 3% and 5%, and ""vastly more on some selected items"". Tesco, along with other supermarkets, have reported a jump in sales recently Despite the impact on prices, he said consumers can expect ""pretty much the same choice of products"" on the shelves once Tesco had adjusted to the new set-up. Supermarkets will get 'grace period' for NI food PM: EU demands in Brexit talks 'unacceptable' Could Brexit make your food more expensive? Mr Allan said Tesco was able to stockpile what he called ""longer-life food"", but there could be temporary shortages of ""short-life fresh foods"". He told Bloomberg: ""We are trying to ensure that we have stockpiled as much as we can of long-life products either in our own warehouses or with our suppliers."" Under WTO rules, supermarkets and other importers would have to pay substantial tariffs on many foods they bring in from the EU. Meat and dairy products face particularly high tariffs, but many other areas including fruit and vegetables would be also affected. As an extreme case, the London School of Economics estimates that some speciality cheeses such as halloumi and roquefort could be 55% more expensive. (Tariffs don't just apply to food - cars made in the EU, for instance, would attract a 10% tariff. But food and drinks are the area where the highest tariffs apply.) Government minister George Eustice said prices on average would rise less than 2%, although he admitted some items such as pork and beef would be hit harder. In the short term, shops could absorb those extra costs themselves. But in the longer term they would likely pass some or all of that cost on to customers, in the form of higher prices. Read more here Earlier on Wednesday, the government announced a series of measures to address urgent concerns about the operation of trade between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. With a couple of rare exceptions, all goods going from UK to Northern Ireland will be exempt from EU tariffs. Proposed food safety checks on goods entering NI will be waived for a grace period of three months. Mr Allen said three months was better than nothing and a ""a step in the right direction"". Brexit happened but rules didn't change at once:The UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020, but leaders needed time to negotiate a deal for life afterwards - they got 11 months. Talks are happening:The UK and the EU have until 31 December 2020 to agree a trade deal as well as other things, such as fishing rights. If there is no deal:Border checks and taxes will be introduced for goods travelling between the UK and the EU. But deal or no deal, we will still see changes. What happens next with Brexit? Tesco has also been diverting shipments to ports other than Dover, which he described as ""the throat that gets squeezed"". It comes as ports such as Felixstowe and Southampton face severe delays caused by a surge in imports, leading some to warn that soaring freight costs could be passed on to UK consumers. On Wednesday, trade group Logistics UK blamed the disruption on concerns about a no-deal Brexit, as well as Covid and the Christmas rush. Tesco sorry after online issues amid Christmas rush What happens if there's no trade deal? Mr Allan cautioned against altering UK food regulations after Brexit, telling the BBC that food suppliers had ""no wish to deviate from current food standards"". He spoke out against allowing imports of US chlorine-washed chicken, saying: ""I think most of the food industry is opposed to it."" He added: ""I can't see us being enthusiastic about contributing to anything that would lower food standards in the UK."" Like other supermarkets, Tesco has seen its profits surge in the pandemic as people spend more time at home and splash out on food. Last week, the retailer said it would repay Â£585m in business rates relief after it was criticised for paying dividends to shareholders. Other retailers followed suit, including Asda, Morrisons and Sainsbury's. TRAVEL RULES: How your holidays will change in 2021 NO DEAL YET: What are the sticking points in trade talks?

Major US lawsuits seek break up of Facebook,"US federal regulators and more than 45 state prosecutors have sued Facebook, accusing the social media company of taking illegal actions to buy up rivals and stifle competition. The lawsuits are one of the most significant legal actions the US government has taken against the firm. Officials are asking the court to consider breaking up the company, which also owns Instagram and WhatsApp. Facebook said the deals under scrutiny were approved by regulators years ago. ""The government now wants a do-over, sending a chilling warning to American business that no sale is ever final,"" Facebook general counsel Jennifer Newstead said. She said the company had invested millions to make Instagram and WhatsApp successful and would defend itself ""vigorously"". ""Antitrust laws exist to protect consumers and promote innovation, not to punish successful businesses,"" Facebook said, describing the government's arguments as ""revisionist history"".

It's quite hard sometimes to comprehend just how massive Facebook is. Facebook, Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp and Instagram - all owned by Facebook - all have more than a billion monthly users. WhatsApp and Facebook have more than two billion. What the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is arguing is that there's a reason why Facebook came to dominate this highly lucrative sector - it acquired the competition illegally. In 2012 Instagram was growing rapidly. Facebook was worried. Zuckerberg has admitted himself previously that Instagram was a competitor to Facebook. It was bought, for what now seems a ludicrously low figure of $1bn. WhatsApp too in 2014 was growing at incredible speeds. Was it going to threaten Facebook's own messenger service? Facebook bought WhatsApp too. Both of these acquisitions were previously looked at by the FTC and were approved. That is Facebook's argument - that they bought these companies when they were much smaller - that there was nothing pre-ordained about their success. In other words, don't punish Facebook for building strong American companies.

Human-made objects to outweigh living things,"Buildings and roads make up the majority of human-made mass Scientists say the weight of human-made objects will likely exceed that of living things by the end of the year. In other words, the combined weight of all the plastic, bricks, concrete and other things we've made in the world will outweigh all animals and plants on the planet for the first time. The estimated weight of human-made objects is about one teratonne. For every person in the world, more than their body weight in stuff is now being produced each week. These astonishing figures have been calculated by a team at the Weizmann Institute of Sciences in Rehovot, Israel, to show how our species is transforming the Earth. ""The significance is symbolic in the sense that it tells us something about the major role that humanity now plays in shaping the world and the state of the Earth around us,"" Dr Ron Milo, who led the research, told BBC News. ""It is a reason for all of us to ponder our role, how much consumption we do and how can we try to get a better balance between the living world and humanity."" Plastic heading for oceans quantified 'Case is made' for Anthropocene Epoch Search for Anthropocene 'golden spike' Since the first agricultural revolution, humans have halved plant biomass The scientists worked out the combined mass of all human-made stuff from 1900 to the present day and compared this with the weight of all the living things on the planet (known as biomass). From plastic bottles to the bricks and concretes we use for buildings and roads, the weight of all the things we produce has been doubling every 20 years recently. At the same time, the weight of living things has been falling, mainly due to the loss of plant life in forests and natural spaces. The scientists knew at some point we would reach a crossover point. And according to their estimates, 2020 is the year when human-made mass from the likes of roads, buildings and machines, will likely overtake that of all the living things in the world. The exact timing is sensitive to definitions, so there may be some variability in the estimates by a few years either side, they say. But if we continue as we are, by 2040, the weight of all human-made stuff will have almost tripled from 1.1 teratonnes (1,100,000,000,000 tonnes) to about three teratonnes. Buildings and roads make up the majority of human-made mass This means humanity is now producing stuff at a rate of more than 30 gigatonnes (30,000,000,000 tonnes) per year. The research, published in Nature, is further evidence that we have entered a new geological age, known as the Anthropocene, where humanity's impacts on Earth will be visible in sediments and rocks millions of years into the future. The formal start date could be the 1950s, which marks the beginning of the ""Great Acceleration"", when the human population and its consumption patterns suddenly speeded up. It coincides with the spread of ubiquitous materials, such as aluminium, concrete and plastic. Follow Helen onTwitter,external.

"Covid not out of control in Wales, FM insists","Wales' coronavirus restrictions are set in Cardiff The coronavirus situation in Wales is ""very difficult"" but not out of control, according to the country's first minister. Mark Drakeford defended his government's decision to have a short lockdown of 17 days in the autumn. He has faced accusations from the opposition of losing his grip on Covid. It comes as Wales' top doctor says ministers are considering whether new measures might be needed before Christmas. Chief Medical Officer Frank Atherton warned there was ""serious pressure"" on the NHS in the country, particularly in south Wales. The government is already looking at what might be needed after the festive holiday, although the first minister had suggested on Tuesday that he would not impose new restrictions before Christmas. NHS staff sickness having 'huge impact' on care Pupils pulled from school in Christmas Covid fear Wales only part of UK without falling Covid rates Mr Drakeford has claimed that the recent rise in cases was partly due to people not being willing to follow the rules. As well as criticising the government's performance the Welsh Conservatives and Plaid Cymru called on ministers to think again about a ban on alcohol in pubs and restaurants in a debate on Wednesday. Health minister Vaughan Gething warned relaxing the measures would mean more people would die. On Tuesday it emerged the Welsh Government's own advisers warned the number of deaths had been abovethe worst case scenarioin recent weeks. Wales had 326.84 cases per 100,000 people in the seven days up to 5 December, up from 223.86 in the week up to 23 November. Dr Atherton said the rate is now almost 350 cases per 100,000 people. Meanwhile the chief medical officer called for people not to mix outside their householdin the run up to Christmas. By Ben Butcher, Reality Check In Wales, the increasing coronavirus rate is generally focused in the more densely populated parts of the country, which include the south and Wrexham, in the north east. Weekly rates are highest in Neath Port Talbot where there are 613 cases for every 100,000 people - twice the Welsh national rate. Rhondda, Blaenau Gwent, Merthyr Tydfil, Swansea and Torfaen are also recording case rates above 400 per 100,000, according to data collected by the UK government. Within these areas though, are particularly high pockets of coronavirus, including rates above 1,200 cases per 100,000 in Caerau in Bridgend, Aberdulais & Resolfen in Port Talbot and Ferndale & Maerdy, Rhondda. Neath Port Talbot with 26 deaths was ranked 19th highest across England and Wales in the latest week So, how does that compare with England? Nationally, England's case rate of 150 cases per 100,000 is roughly half that of Wales. And, with the exception of Medway, England currently has no local authorities with case rates higher than 400 cases per 100,000 people. However, there are small pockets in some areas with high case rates. This includes Great Chell, Stoke-on-Trent where cases are as high as 1,313 per 100,000 people - although mass testing might contribute to this. Chatham South and parts of Rochester in Medway also have high rates. These local hotspots could be due to an outbreak in a school, hospitals or workplaces, which can be controlled if found quickly. In October, many university towns and cities saw localised outbreaks on campuses, including Fallowfield in Manchester where the rate went as high as 7,574 cases per 100,000. Speaking to BBC Breakfast, Mr Drakeford said: ""The virus is in a very difficult position in Wales, I wouldn't describe it as out of control."" Mr Drakeford said he had taken action to bring the virus under control through his decision to ban the sale of alcohol in hospitality venues and close them in the evenings, ""in the teeth of opposition"", he said, ""from other parties"". Defending his government's handling of the crisis, he emphasised the personal responsibility of Welsh citizens in bringing rates down. He denied that Wales had come out of the firebreak too early: ""The firebreak period did everything that we had hoped. ""It set the clock back three weeks. It gave us three weeks where the R number was below one."" Mark Drakeford defended his decision making on coronavirus But those gains had waned since, Mr Drakeford said. ""And that is partly because despite the very strict rules we have here in Wales, fatigue - people's sense of no hope for the future - has meant that not everybody has been willing to abide by the restrictions that are still necessary."" After the firebreak Wales abandoned the system of local lockdowns, which had covered most of the population and effectively barred non-essential travel outside of county boundaries. But Mr Drakeford insisted that the post-firebreak rules ""were very strict"". ""They were stricter than the rules we had before we went into it, in restricting people's ability to meet inside homes and meeting in gardens, a smaller number of people able to meet outdoors and so on,"" he said. There will be less restrictive rules during Christmas Andrew RT Davies, the Welsh Conservative health spokesman, said: ""It would seem that there are those within the Welsh Labour-led Government speaking from different scripts. Messaging is confusing and contradictory. ""But this is set against the backdrop of the highest reported rates of deaths and new infections in the UK, and at the same time, the number of days a person needs to self-isolate forbeing reduced to 10. Hardly fitting into the narrative Labour's been pushing of keeping Wales safe."" Plaid Cymru health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth said: ""We all have a responsibility as individuals to do the right things to keep ourselves, our friends, families and communities safe. ""But government can't simply try to deflect all the blame onto others - ministers have to keep their side of the bargain by putting robust strategies in place, enforcing restrictions properly, communicating effectively and giving people the support they need to stop the spread of the virus."" ""Plaid Cymru called for more sustainable measures as we came out of the firebreak - including a more gradual easing of restrictions and optimising Wales' own testing capacity to reach the 24-hour turnaround timescale target. ""The Labour Welsh Government failed to do that and now hospitality is paying the price."" The grim figures on Covid cases, deaths and hospital inpatients are increasing the pressure on ministers. They say that the behaviour of some members of the public partly explains this picture. While no one can deny that the choices we make have consequences for Covid spread, public behaviour alone can't explain why Wales has become an outlier amongst the home nations - after all England, Scotland and Northern Ireland all have people making choices about their lives, just as we do in Wales. Policy decisions are relevant too and so is the timing of them. The first minister insists that the controversial hospitality restrictions will start to make a difference soon but the Christmas relaxation will likely push case rates in the wrong direction. That means more tough policy decisions are imminent. In the Senedd on Wednesday the Welsh Conservatives and Plaid Cymru called for measures introduced last Friday to ban the sale of alcohol in hospitality venues to be looked at again. The Conservative Darren Millar called for the ""immediate suspension"" of the regulations ""and for a more targeted and proportionate approach going forward"". ""We believe that the decision to impose severe restrictions on the hospitality and entertainment industries across Wales is neither proportionate nor reasonable,"" he said. Plaid Cymru's Rhun ap Iorwerth said his party wanted a rethink because ""elements of the nationwide restrictions were wrong"". Some people were ""questioning the logic"" of the latest measures, he said, because four people can meet for a coffee but ""not even an individual can have a quiet pint in the same establishment"". But the Health Minister Vaughan Gething said he hoped the ""sobering, troubling and undeniably serious figures of the last few days will have given all members the time to pause and reflect"". ""As we face the prospect of greater harm, as we face the prospect of a hard, difficult and deadly winter ahead of us without further changes, I hope that in the face of that prospect members will reflect on whether this Senedd should vote today to relax restrictions. ""I believe doing so will undoubtedly cause greater harm and undoubtedly will lead to avoidable deaths for the people we serve."" Independent Reform Alliance MS Caroline Jones said she was ""disappointed"" that the Senedd was simply being asked to ""rubber stamp decisions which have already been made"". ""This isn't democracy. This has become an elected dictatorship,"" she said. Senedd members voted to reject a series of opposition demands for changes to the strategy. Conservative calls for ministers to publish the evidence they based their decision for closing indoor entertainment venues on, and to make ""sufficient financial support available to businesses in a timely manner"", were supported by all the parties in the chamber. Members will vote on whether they approve the regulations themselves next week.

Canada joins UK in approving Pfizer Covid vaccine,"The vaccine is already being rolled out in the UK Canada's health regulator has approved the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine, the day after the UK became the first country in the world to roll it out. Health Canada called the authorisation a ""milestone"" in the country's fight against coronavirus. The agency said the vaccine met its ""stringent safety, efficacy and quality requirements"". Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says Canada is set to receive up to 249,000 doses of the vaccine this month. In total, the Canadian government has purchased 20 million doses of the vaccine - enough to inoculate 10 million people - with the option to buy 56 million more. On Tuesday,a UK grandmother was the first person in the world to be given the jab as part of a mass vaccination programme. This video can not be played Margaret Keenan was given the vaccine by May Parsons, at University Hospital in Coventry Bahrain has also approved the emergency use of the vaccine. US regulators haveconfirmed the vaccine is 95% effective,paving the way for it to be approved for emergency use there. Advisers to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are set to meet on Thursday to formally review whether the US should authorise its use. Health Canada said it approved the vaccine on Wednesday ""after a thorough, independent review of the evidence"". The announcement clears the way for doses to be delivered and administered across the country. Officials say Canada has 14 distribution sites equipped with the necessary cold storage for the vaccine. How does the Pfizer vaccine work? What you need to know about vaccine safety Will countries be left behind in the vaccine race? Healthcare workers and vulnerable groups, such as the elderly, will be among the first to receive it. The vaccine has initially been authorised for use on people aged 16 and over. Pfizer Canada said the approval marked ""a historic step forward in our efforts to reduce the number of Canadians suffering from this devastating virus"". Ontario Premier Doug Ford reacted to the news on Twitter, saying the province would be ready to deliver and administer doses ""as soon as vaccines arrive on Ontario soil"". ""Friends, the light at the end of the tunnel grows brighter,"" he wrote. Earlier on Wednesday, British regulators saidpeople with a history of significant allergic reactions should not have the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid jab, after two NHS workers had allergic reactions. The advice applies to those who have had reactions to medicines, food or vaccines. Professor Stephen Powis, medical director for the NHS in England, said this was ""common with new vaccines"", describing it as a precautionary measure. Health Canada officials told reporters they were only advising people with allergies to any of the ingredients in the vaccine to avoid it. They said they would monitor developments in the UK and decide whether to expand that guidance. Canada also has contracts with several other vaccine manufacturers. Mr Trudeau has said most Canadians should be vaccinated by September 2021. The People's Vaccine Alliance - a network of organisations including Amnesty International, Oxfam and Global Justice Now - claims Canada has ordered enough vaccines to protect each Canadian five times, if all the vaccines are approved for use. The group has accused rich countries of hoarding doses, andsays poor countries are set to miss out. How does the Pfizer vaccine work?

Court finds UK war crimes but will not take action,"The International Criminal Court says it will not take action against the UK, despite finding evidence British troops committed war crimes in Iraq. A 180-page report,externalsays hundreds of Iraqi detainees were abused by British soldiers between 2003 and 2009. But the ICC could not determine whether the UK had acted to shield soldiers from prosecution. The MoD said the ICC report ""vindicates our efforts to pursue justice where allegations have been founded"". The ICC told the BBC: ""It is without dispute there is evidence war crimes were committed."" Its report said there was a reasonable basis to conclude that at least seven Iraqis were illegally killed while in British custody between April and September 2003. Government and military 'covered up war crimes' War crimes court considers probe into UK army The ICC report refers to evidence of a pattern of war crimes carried out across a number of years by soldiers from several British regiments. Some detainees were raped or subjected to sexual violence. Others were beaten so badly they died from their injuries. The Iraqi individuals, many of them civilians, were unarmed and in British custody at the time. The UK government has repeatedly accused human rights lawyers of bringing vexatious claims, but the ICC says it is ""disingenuous to describe the entire body of claims, involving hundreds of claimants, as baseless or spurious"". A BBC Panorama investigation last year revealed that British detectives had also found credible evidence of war crimes committed in Iraq. But the programme discovered that despite this, not one of the cases was taken forward by the army's prosecution service. British army base Camp Stephen in Basra, Iraq, where numerous detainees were alleged to have been abused and killed The ICC said it took Panorama's findings very seriously, and that on the whole the information it received was consistent with the reports in the programme. It could ""not rule out"" that there had been a cover up on the part of the British authorities. Its report concluded that investigations by the Royal Military Police had been ""inadequate"" and were ""marred by a lack of independence and impartiality"". However, it could not make a determination as to whether the UK had acted to shield soldiers from prosecution. The ICC said it will reopen its examination of the UK's conduct in Iraq ""should new facts or evidence"" come to light. The UK government is currently seeking to introduce a controversial new law which will make it harder to prosecute British soldiers. It says the Overseas Operations (Service Personnel and Veterans) Bill, if passed, ""delivers on the government's manifesto commitment to tackle vexatious claims and end the cycle of re-investigations against our brave Armed Forces"". After scrutinising the proposed legislation, Parliament's Joint Human Rights Committee has said: ""We found that the real problem is that investigations into incidents have been inadequate, insufficiently resourced, insufficiently independent and not done in a timely manner. ""The government is effectively using the existence of inadequate investigations as a reason to legislate to bring in further barriers to bringing prosecutions or to providing justice for victims"". There is a palpable sense of relief inside the Ministry of Defence that the International Criminal Court will not be pursuing a case against the UK government over allegations that British forces in Iraq committed serious war crimes against Iraqi detainees. That said, there's still the potential that the ICC report will cause the government problems. The publication comes as the government tries to pass new legislation aimed at protecting troops from what it calls ""vexatious claims"" by lawyers against British troops over allegations of abuse. Among the proposals of the Overseas Operations Bill is a presumption against prosecution five years after any alleged abuse, unless there's compelling new evidence. The legislation, which has already passed its first stages in the Commons, has been widely criticised by opposition parties, human rights groups, lawyers and some former senior military commanders. The ICC report also raises concerns about the legislation. The Ministry of Defence says the ICC has brought no new evidence to light. But the ICC prosecutor says: ""The fact the allegations investigated by the UK did not result in prosecutions does not mean that these claims were vexatious."" Those words will  be seized upon by the bill's critics. One of the investigations by the Royal Military Police, featured in last year's Panorama, was into the death of Radhi Nama in British custody. The Royal Military Police concluded he had died of a heart attack - even though his body and face showed signs he had been beaten. To date, no one has been prosecuted in connection with Radhi Nama's death. His daughter, Afaf Radhi Nama, told Panorama: ""I saw torture signs on his body. ""They covered his head and tied his hands, he could not defend himself, and they killed him. It is my wish to see the soldiers who committed this crime put on trial and facing justice. ""If I was a British citizen my rights would be respected, but because I am an Iraqi citizen, it seems I have no rights."" Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said the ICC review ""confirms that the UK is willing and able to investigate and prosecute claims of wrongdoing by armed forces personnel"". He said it had brought to light ""no new evidence"" and the ICC statement ""vindicates our efforts to pursue justice where allegations have been founded"". ""I am pleased that work we have done, and continue to do, in improving the quality and assurances around investigations has been recognised by the ICC,"" he said. ""The Service Justice System Review and the appointment of Sir Richard Henriques to provide assurance of our investigative processes are all steps towards making sure we have one of the best service justice systems in the world.""

Grenfell inquiry halted for weeks after Covid case,"The inquiry into the Grenfell Tower fire has been suspended for over a month after a member of staff tested positive for Covid-19. Its chairman, Sir Martin Moore-Bick, said a number of staff needed to self-isolate and there would not be enough to continue hearing evidence. It was due to break for Christmas on 17 December, but hearings will now not resume until at least 11 January. Sir Martin said it was ""extremely disappointing"". Speaking at the end of the hearing on Wednesday, he said he learnt ""earlier on today that one of the members of the inquiry team has tested positive for Covid-19"". ""As a result a number of members of the inquiry team and support staff are going to have to go into self-isolation for a couple of weeks,"" he said. Four possible reasons for the Grenfell Tower fire Grenfell Tower fire: Who were the victims? Tributes paid to 'inspiring' Grenfell campaigner Staff had tried to work out a way for witnesses to continue giving evidence, he said, ""but we've come to the conclusion that that simply is not possible"". ""Regrettably at this point we're going to have to close the hearings for the time being, we shall not be able to sit tomorrow and we shall not be able to sit next week,"" he said. ""So that means that we're going to have to close down the inquiry at least as far as hearings are concerned until January 11, when we shall resume."" Sir Martin added: ""It's extremely disappointing, I'm very sorry to have to give you all this news but we feel that there is nothing we can do to keep ourselves going in the interim."" The Grenfell inquiry has been running with fewer people than normal in attendance since it reopened in the summer, having closed during the first lockdown. Its first phase concluded that cladding put on the west London tower block during its refurbishment fuelled the fire in June 2017 in which 72 people died. The inquiry is now examining how the blaze could have happened in the first place. Last month, an ex-manager of an insulation maker whose product was used on the towerapologised for dismissing fire safety concerns and threatening legal action in internal emails.

Mahalia and Nines win big at MOBOs 2020,"Mahalia won Best R&B/Soul and Best Female at this year's awards After a two-year break, the MOBO Awards have returned with a socially-distant show. The ceremony was hosted by Maya Jama and Chunkz and broadcast on YouTube. Mahalia and Nines both won two awards, with Mahalia taking home Best R&B/Soul and Best Female and Nines winning Best Album and Best Hip Hop act. Mahalia told Newsbeat: ""As a young black artist at the MOBOs, everything it stands for and holds is really special."" The pandemic ""put a stop"" to a lot of Young T and Bugsey's plans Young T and Bugsey were awarded Best Song for Don't Rush. The Nottingham duo said the viral Don't Rush challenge helped it become such a staple sound of 2020. Bugsey said: ""Day by day it was just growing and getting bigger and bigger, we had no idea that would happen. ""I was a big wrestling fan as a kid, so when I saw that the whole WWE lot did the challenge I was like 'yeah, we're doing something'."" The pair released their mixtape at the start of the year, with plans for tours and other live performances. ""All artists have had to learn how to manoeuvre through it, hopefully next year shows will be back again."" In a year filled with ""way too many Zoom calls"", the Best Newcomer award is some good news for Aitch Aitch, who picked up Best Newcomer, said the event was a good end to a bad year. He told Newsbeat: ""It's sick to be recognised for what I'm doing."" In a year like no other, Aitch says time away from touring and performances has had some advantages. ""Some things have happened that wouldn't have happened if I was out on the road."" Although he's done ""way too many Zoom calls"". It was Maya's second time hosting the show Chunkz won Best Media Personality up against names including Clara Amfo, Mo Gilligan and co-host Maya Jama. With social-distancing measures in place, it might not have been the best year to host such a big event. But, after the MOBOs were cancelled in 2018 and 2019, founder Kanya King said she ""felt like she had to"" bring them back. She said: ""2020 has been such a unique year and MOBO has always a spotlight for talent to shine. ""Entertainment and activism have always gone hand in hand, and we're using the power of black culture to empower and uplift people."" This year's ceremony also included a one-off category to retrospectively award the best albums released between September 2017 and August 2019, which was won by Ella Mai. Nines won two awards, and gave his acceptance speech via video For a lot of artists, the pandemic was a chance to get creative. Mahalia released her EP Isolation Tapes in May, made up of songs she previously hadn't found time to finish. ""If isolation hadn't happened, I might never have seen those songs again,"" she says. Although it's been a ""confusing and stressful"" year, Mahalia said ultimately she learned to ""be present and full of energy online"". ""I think a lot of us artists in that time realised how important social media platforms are,"" she says. ""It's a gateway to be able to speak to fans. I wasn't very good at that before so this has been a learning curve for sure."" Young T and Bugsey agree. ""It made you interact with fans more and people who support you more because you can be connected,"" Young T said.

"Vaccine documents hacked at EU medicines agencyThe EMA, which is assessing two Covid-19 vaccines, launches a ""full investigation"" after the attack.Technology","The European Medicines Agency (EMA) says it has been hit by a cyber-attack and documents relating to a Covid-19 vaccine have been accessed. BioNTech, which makes one of the vaccines in partnership with Pfizer, said its regulatory submission was accessed during the attack. The EMA is working on approval of two Covid-19 vaccines, which it expects to conclude within weeks. The cyber-attack was not expected to impact that timeline, BioNTech said. The EMA did not provide any details on the nature of the cyber-attack in a brief statement on its website, beyond saying a full investigation had been launched. A spokesperson for the agency said it was still ""functional"". But BioNTech,in a statement published on its website,external, said it had been told its documents had been accessed. ""Today, we were informed... that the agency has been subject to a cyber-attack and that some documents relating to the regulatory submission for Pfizer and BioNTech's Covid-19 vaccine candidate, BNT162b2, which has been stored on an EMA server, had been unlawfully accessed,"" it said. ""EMA has assured us that the cyber-attack will have no impact on the timeline for its review,"" it added. It said it had made the details of the hack public ""given the critical public health considerations and the importance of transparency"". And it also said it was ""unaware"" of any personal data of participants in its medical studies being compromised. The EMA authorises the use of medicines across the European Union. It is trying to decide if the Pfizer/BioNTech jab - which has just begun being rolled out in the UK - and another made by Moderna are safe for use in EU countries. It is not clear if the Moderna documents have also been accessed. The cyber-attack is the latest in a string of attacks and warnings about hacking threats against vaccine-makers and public health bodies. Allergy warning over Covid vaccine Rich countries 'hoarding Covid vaccines' The use of cyber-attacks against bodies involved in the vaccine rollout has been a feature of recent months. Security services warned in the summerthat Russian intelligence had been targeting organisationsattempting to develop a successful vaccine. In October,a pharmaceutical company based in Indiawas the victim of a significant cyber-attack. And in recent days, IBM saidthe cold storage supply chain used to transport viable vaccineshad come under cyber-attack - probably by a nation state. The cyber-attack comes the day before the agency is due to update the European Parliament on the progress of the vaccine assessments. Euro-MPs on the Public Health Committee are due to quiz the agency's executive director ""on how close the most advanced vaccines are to receiving authorisation"" on Thursday. The UK's National Cyber Security Centre, meanwhile, said there was no indication the cyber-attack would affect the rollout of the vaccine in the UK. ""We are working with international partners to understand the impact of this incident affecting the EU's medicine regulator, but there is currently no evidence to suggest that the UK's medicine regulator has been affected,"" it said.

Currys agrees to honour lost Black Friday salesShoppers said they had earlier been told to pay full price to re-order items cancelled due to a fault.,"The firm says it experienced record demand on 27 November Currys PC World has said that customers who lost out on Black Friday deals because it cancelled their orders will be able to buy the goods again at the same discounted prices. The electronics retailer has blamed a website glitch for causing it to lose at least some of the sales involved. Its pledge comesafter the BBC reported cases of shoppers being toldthey would have to reorder and pay the full cost. The firm said it had yet to quantify how many people had been affected. ""We will be honouring promotional prices for any customer who placed an order between 25 November and 1 December and received an email confirmation of purchase but then had the order cancelled,"" a spokeswoman told the BBC. ""If we are out of stock on their item of choice we will give the customer a 10% discount off a similar product."" She added that a form would be added to the store's website by the end of Thursday to help those who qualify resolve the matter. Currys PC World - which is owned by Dixons Carphone - said it had experienced an ""unprecedented volume of customers"" on 27 November, which had caused its site to fail. The outage led it to lose details of transactions made via gift cards as well as some Order and Collect purchases. In addition, it said, some users who bought goods for home delivery via debit or credit cards had their orders cancelled for other reasons. Many of the firm's stores were closed because of coronavirus restrictions, putting more pressure on the website Many customers did not suspect there was an issue as they had been sent an order confirmation email. And they only discovered there was a problem after the sale ended when they contacted the firm to chase up undelivered items or arrived to pick up goods. ""I waited in all day [for the delivery], rang them up and they said it had been cancelled,"" one Surrey-based shopper who had ordered two computers told the BBC. ""It was very disappointing.

PM: EU demands in Brexit talks 'unacceptable',"This video can not be played Addressing trade talks with the EU, Boris Johnson has âabsolutely no doubt this country is going to prosper mightilyâ. Boris Johnson has said the EU is insisting on terms ""no prime minister could accept"" in UK-EU trade talks. The PM told MPs ""a good deal is still there to be done"", ahead of post-Brexit deal negotiations with the European Commission president. But he said the EU was seeking an ""automatic right"" to retaliate against the UK if its labour and environmental standards diverged from theirs. He is in Brussels for talks with EU chief Ursula von der Leyen. The prime minister also suggested the EU could not accept the UK having sovereign control over its fishing waters after Brexit, as he answered questions at Prime Minister's Questions. Time is running out to reach a deal before 31 December, when the UK stops following EU trading rules. Major disagreements remain on fishing rights, business competition rules and how a deal will be policed. Live: PM and EU chief seek to unblock trade deal Kuenssberg analysis: Will Brexit dinner prove to be the last supper? What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? What happens if there's no trade deal? At the dinner, expected to begin at 19:00 GMT, the prime minister will work through a list of the major sticking points with Mrs von der Leyen, who is representing the leaders of the 27 EU nations. A UK government source said progress at a political level may allow the UK's negotiator Lord Frost and his EU counterpart Michel Barnier - who will both also attend the dinner - to resume their work over the coming days. But the source added that it was important to be ""realistic"" that an agreement might not be possible. Meanwhile, Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove outlined details on post-Brexit border checks and trading rules for Northern Ireland, after agreement was reached with the EU. Brexit happened but rules didn't change at once:The UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020, but leaders needed time to negotiate a deal for life afterwards - they got 11 months. Talks are happening:The UK and the EU have until 31 December 2020 to agree a trade deal as well as other things, such as fishing rights. If there is no deal:Border checks and taxes will be introduced for goods travelling between the UK and the EU. But deal or no deal, we will still see changes. What happens next with Brexit? Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Johnson warned that a deal would not be possible if the EU continued to insist that if it was to pass a new law in the future - and the UK did not follow suit  -  it wanted the ""automatic right punish us and retaliate"" with tariffs on goods. He also claimed that the EU wanted the UK to become the ""only country in the world"" not to have ""sovereign control"" over its fishing waters. ""I don't believe that those are terms that any prime minister of this country should accept,"" he said. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has said a Brexit deal was still possible but insisted that the integrity of the EU single market must be respected. The UK and EU are at loggerheads over the so-called ""level playing field"" - a set of shared rules and standards to ensure businesses in one country do not have an unfair advantage over their competitors in others. Brussels wants the UK to follow EU rules closely in areas such as workers' rights and environmental regulations, but the UK says the goal of Brexit is to break free from following common rules and reassert national sovereignty. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg says that the purpose of the dinner is not to call a halt or to proclaim that a deal's been done. ""The reason for the meeting is to see if both sides are willing in principle to tolerate the notion of budging, after the negotiations, and frankly negotiators, have been exhausted,"" she says. EU leaders are due to meet for a summit of their own on Thursday. It comes as no surprise at all that EU-UK talks have gone down to the wire. That was widely predicted. As was the ""both making last-minute political compromises"" part, believed to come right at the end, after the two sides abandon their high-stakes game of chicken. But tonight's dinner is far more complex than the prime minister declaring ""OK, Ursula, we'll give you your level playing field, if you (EU) give us our fish."" The clash of ideologies, clear from the start, is still very much present. We have the government's determination to protect its post-Brexit sovereignty, and not sign up to another Brussels rule book on the one side and on the other, the EU focus on protecting its single market a) from what it views as potentially unfair competition from the UK and b) in terms of global reputation. Brussels believes compromising single market rules for a UK deal, would weaken it in the eyes of other future trade partners. Conclusion: As much as Boris Johnson and Ursula von der Leyen, say they still hope for a deal, 'no deal' is still very much on the table tonight, alongside dinner. In separate talks on Tuesday, the UK and EUreached an agreementon specific trade arrangements for Northern Ireland - including on post-Brexit border checks and trading rules for Northern Ireland. From 1 January, Northern Ireland will stay in the EU single market for goods as the rest of the UK leaves. That means a proportion of food products arriving in Northern Ireland from Great Britain will need to be checked under arrangements known as the Northern Ireland Protocol. Supermarkets will get 'grace period' for NI food UK to drop US goods tariffs in bid for trade deal UK and EU reach deal over NI border checks The main points include: All goods going from Britain to Northern Ireland will be exempt from EU tariffs, with a handful of exceptions NI supermarkets and suppliers won't have to carry out food safety checks on GB goods for three months There will be a longer six month ""grace period"" for checks on chilled meat products, such as sausages NI firms won't have to complete GB export declarations except in a very few cases Subsidies for NI fishing and farming businesses will be exempt from EU state aid rules EU customs officials will be able to observe border checks but not carry them out Speaking in the Commons, Mr Gove said it would ensure the smooth flow of trade ""on which lives and livelihoods depend....with no need for new physical customs infrastructure"" on the island of Ireland. ""The deal protects unfettered access for Northern Ireland businesses to their most important market,"" he said.

Crunch talks over UK-EU trade deal get under way,"""Very large gaps remain"" between the UK and EU, despite a meeting between Boris Johnson and EU chief Ursula von der Leyen aimed at breaking the Brexit trade deadlock, No 10 has said. And Mrs von der Leyen said the two sides were still ""far apart"". Talks between the UK's chief negotiator Lord Frost and the EU's Michel Barnier will resume in Brussels. But Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said it was ""unlikely"" the negotiations would be extended beyond Sunday. After their meeting, the prime minister and European Commission president ""agreed that by Sunday a firm decision should be taken about the future of the talks"", a No 10 spokesperson added. And on Thursday morning,the EU set out the measuresit would implement in the event of a no-deal scenario. The plan includes allowing aviation safety certificates to continue to apply to avoid the grounding of aircraft. What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? EU sets out plans in case Brexit trade talks fail Seven things that will change from 1 January The BBC's Laura Kuenssberg said the evening discussions between Mr Johnson and Mrs von der Leyen had ""plainly gone badly"" and the chances of the UK leaving the post-Brexit transition period at the end of the year without a firm arrangement was a ""big step closer"". Time is running out to reach a deal before 31 December, when the UK stops following EU trading rules. Major disagreements remain on fishing rights, business competition rules and how a deal will be policed. The dinner was seen as a last-ditch opportunity to work through the main sticking points and for the two sides to try and find some common ground. If at first you don't succeed you can try and try. But eventually, sometimes failure is what follows. That now seems the likely outcome of months of talks designed to create a smooth path for the country towards a different future - a deal that, in theory, would ease the junction from membership of a huge trading bloc to a world outside. There is a chance still that a couple of frantic days could result in a change. The prime minister could decide that after all, the potential disruption of no deal is just too great to risk. The EU president might be able to persuade continental leaders to budge, as they gather in Brussels today. But the chance of reassessing and refreshing the efforts seem now remote. Read more from Laura In a statement, the UK side said there had been ""a frank discussion about the significant obstacles which remain in the negotiations"". ""Very large gaps remain between the two sides and it is still unclear whether these can be bridged,"" a No 10 spokesperson said. They said the two sides had agreed to further discussions over the next few days, and the PM did ""not want to leave any route to a possible deal untested"". The two negotiators, Lord Frost and Mr Barnier, also attended the three-hour dinner meeting between the two leaders. Who is EU's powerful head Ursula von der Leyen? Brexit food supply fears grow Mrs von der Leyensaid the discussions,externalhad been ""lively and interesting"", and the two sides fully ""understand each other's positions"" but they ""remain far apart"". ""We will come to a decision by the end of the weekend,"" she said. Meanwhilethe UK has signeda free trade deal with Singapore. The agreement is broadly similar to the Southeast Asian country's current arrangement with the EU and will cover a trade relationship worth more than Â£17bn. International Trade Secretary Liz Truss is now travelling to Vietnam to conclude a trade agreement with that country. The EU, taken as a whole is the UK's largest trading partner, with UK exports to the EU totalling Â£294bn - or 43% of all UK exports - in 2019. Dinner between Boris Johnson and Ursula von der Leyen ended as predicted in Brussels - with neither a breakdown, nor a breakthrough in the trade talks impasse. EU diplomats say the bloc is ready to go the extra mile during the next days of negotiations but contrary to the UK government view, the EU thinks the decision - deal or no deal - lies primarily in Downing Street. Brexit isn't on the official discussion agenda at an EU summit starting in Brussels later today, though leaders will be briefed on the negotiations. Attitudes seem to be hardening. ""No deal is better than a bad deal"" is a sentiment you hear both sides of the Channel now. Speaking to the BBC, Mr Raab said: ""I think we are rapidly approaching the point where we need some finality."" Asked if talks would go beyond Sunday, he said it was ""unlikely"" but added ""never quite say never when you are negotiating with the EU"". Responding toa warning from the Tesco chair that food prices could rise were a deal not to be agreed,Mr Raab acknowledged there could be ""some bumps along the road"" but said he was ""not concerned about either supermarket cupboards running bare or food prices"". The Confederation of British Industry said the cost of no deal was ""significant"". Its director-general, Tony Danker, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""The difference between a deal and no deal is incredibly real in GDP [gross domestic product] terms, it's incredibly real for businesses - particularly in certain sectors - so we have to be in 'getting to yes' mode."" This video can not be played Dominic Raab says it's 'unlikely' negotiations will be extended beyond Sunday Labour's deputy leader, Angela Rayner, said the prime minister had ""completely failed"" to deliver the ""oven-ready"" deal he had promised at the last election. ""The failure to deliver the deal he promised is his and his alone,"" she said. Earlier this week, Mr Johnson said the oven-ready deal he was referring to was the withdrawal agreement, or divorce deal, rather than a trade deal. SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford tweeted: ""A no deal would be a massive failure of diplomacy and leadership which Boris Johnson has to take ownership of."" Meanwhile, Tory Brexiteer MP John Baron said the PM deserved praise for ""standing firm"" rather than compromising in a rush to agree a deal. ""We must remember a trade deal is for keeps, not just for Christmas,"" he said. ""We all want a deal, but it has to be a good deal because as we've said many times before, no deal is better than a bad deal."" Speaking before he left for Brussels, Mr Johnson said the EU was insisting on terms ""no prime minister could accept"" in relation to access to UK fishing waters and retaliatory measures if the UK diverged from EU standards. Brexit happened but rules didn't change at once:The UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020, but leaders needed time to negotiate a deal for life afterwards - they got 11 months. Talks are happening:The UK and the EU have until 31 December 2020 to agree a trade deal as well as other things, such as fishing rights. If there is no deal:Border checks and taxes will be introduced for goods travelling between the UK and the EU. But deal or no deal, we will still see changes. Any deal also has to be ratified by the European Parliament and win the backing of MPs at Westminster. The House of Commons could sit as late as Christmas Eve should it be required to look at a Brexit deal, Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle said. Under current plans, the Commons will stop sitting on 21 December, but he told Sky News the recess could be delayed. SIMPLE GUIDE: What happens next with Brexit?

Analysis: Will dinner be the last supper?,"Could it be the last supper? Boris Johnson will travel to Brussels for the first time in months on Wednesday night to sit and break bread with the EU Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen. It is more than a standard diplomatic dinner. It is possible that the encounter could be the moment at which the UK and the EU conclude that there cannot be a trade deal now, and that after decades of political and economic ties, efforts to say a polite political farewell have failed, with all theconsequences that might entail. The purpose of the dinner however is not to call a halt. But nor is the purpose to proclaim that a deal's been done. What you need to know about Brexit What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? PM heads to Brussels on Wednesday for Brexit talks The reason for the meeting is to see if both sides are willing in principle to tolerate the notion of budging, after the negotiations, and frankly negotiators, have been exhausted. If the prime minister and Mrs von der Leyen can look each other in the eye and agree that there are still compromises to be had, then a deal is still possible. If they are willing to make that kind of pact - to say privately to each other, I'm willing to budge if you are too - then that would in theory allow technical talks to get going again. This wouldn't be any kind of changes to the formal mandates - the boundaries the negotiators have been set. But it could reset the dial, sending Lord Frost and Michel Barnier back to the table in the understanding that their political bosses might just be a touch more wiling to be flexible after all. TRAVEL RULES: How your holidays will change in 2021 NO DEAL YET: What are the sticking points in trade talks? BREXIT: Seven things that will change on 1 January In turn, that doesn't mean that a deal is going to be achieved. But it could tip the balance back towards the overall political imperatives of making this happen, and away from both sides' commitment to stick so closely to their principles. Here, the government's actions on the Northern Ireland protocol on Tuesday are a hint that they just might be willing to bend a little further. Equally however,settling the joint protocolmakes it easier for the government to minimise disruption if it walks away. So beware wise sages claiming it's definitive proof either way! Don't forget too, it's only this time last week that there was a sense we were moving towards a conclusion on both sides. But that was before some member states, with France as the hard man, toughened their approach, surprising the UK and setting the process back - although any change is still denied officially by the EU side. What we just can't know, however, is whether the leaders will be able to find common cause when they meet on Wednesday. There has been a real sense of ""you first"" in the last 24 hours, with both sides waiting to see what the other's next move would be. If there is a chance that a deal can be done, tomorrow night's dinner needs to produce at the very least a metaphorical statement of intent. But if the two leaders just aren't prepared to make a leap, it could yet be the last supper after all. P.S. It's interesting to note that when Theresa May was trying to manage these processes, she sometimes dashed off to see the individual leaders of the member states, or held phone calls with them, as did Boris Johnson sometimes. There was one notable explosion with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on a call last year, which now seems a century ago. It's understood that this time Boris Johnson's team was interested in the possibility of talking to Mrs Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron in these vital few days themselves. But I'm told the EU wanted to keep everything channelled through one point of contact. Downing Street has denied the suggestion this afternoon that he wanted them to be on the call when he rang Mrs von der Leyen on Monday. But it seems there have been discussions about whether to have those separate discussions that have then not (so far) taken place. What does Australia have to do with Brexit?

What if there's no trade deal?,"The UK and the European Union have agreed to continue talks to try to reach a deal on their future relationship Even though ""major unresolved topics"" remain, both sides said it was important discussions continued. Failure to reach an agreement by 31 December would result in a no-deal Brexit. It would mean significant differences in the way we live and work. Prices could go upfor the goods the UK buys and sells from and to the EU. That's because the UK and EU would trade onWorld Trade Organization (WTO) terms- the basic rules for countries without trade deals. The EU would impose taxes (known as tariffs) on goods coming from the UK. The average is about 2.8% for non-agricultural products, but 10% for cars and more than 35% for dairy products. That would put some industries under pressure. With the UK alsoimposing tariffs on some EU goods,external- they could become more expensive. But the price of some things imported from the rest of the world could fall because their tariffs are being cut. Food standardsfor UK exports could also be a problem. Without agreement that UK rules are acceptable in the EU, produce being sold by the UK could be stopped at the border, causing delays. Long queues for lorriesare possible because there would bemore border checks. The UK is delaying having full checks for goods arriving from the EU until 1 July. But it is feared EU lorry drivers might want to avoid the UK altogether if there are long delays. Less choice of foodis a danger, according to some supermarket chains, who have said fresh food will be particularly affected. They might try to fly replacements in from elsewhere, but that would increase costs. Northern Irelandhas been the subject of separate talks on howan agreement to avoid a hard border would work. An agreement has been reached 'in principle', but a free trade deal would make new arrangements easier. But across the UK it's not just trade that would be affected by no deal, as further details were expected in other areas. Fishinghas beenparticularly importantduring the trade talks. Without a deal, non-UK fishing boats would lose access to UK waters and vice versa. It is feared there could be confrontations if boats try to continue to fish where they have traditionally done so. There are also concerns UK fish exports to the EU would be badly hit by tariffs. Co-operation on security and data-sharingwould become much more difficult, causing problems for cross-border investigations. The UK would immediately lose access to databases of things like fingerprints, criminal records and wanted persons. There arebig questions about services. The UK has been waiting for a decision about whether the EU will recognise UK rules for financial services. Without that it will be more difficult for UK firms to operate in the EU. Some banks have already moved offices and staff to EU countries. The supply of medicines could be vulnerableto disruption at Channel ports, with particular worries about those with a short shelf life. There are plans in placeto ensure coronavirus vaccines reach the UK. Talks separate to the main trade deal were also being worked on. They cover areas including: Healthcare:The government is in talks for a healthcare arrangement thatwould replace EHIC, which helps people in need of treatment in EU countries. Education:It was also in talks about the possibility of continuing to participate inErasmus, which helps students study in other countries. Driving:Talks are still going on about whether UK nationalswill need International Driving Permitsfor short visits to EU countries. And the European Commission is understood to be considering whether green cards to prove people have valid insurance are required. Pensions:There has not yet been an agreement for peopleclaiming their UK state pensions in an EU countrythat would mean their pensions increase every year. If the UK gets to the end of the year without a trade deal with the EU, that does not mean there will never be one. It has been suggested all the problems it would cause would focus minds on reaching a deal as soon as possible. But there are those on both sides who say it could be many months into 2021 before talks were to resume in this scenario. Whether or not there is a trade deal, several things will change on 1 January. Fortrips to Europe, you'll have to make sure there is at least six months left on your passport and wait in a different queue at the border. Duty free shoppingwill return, but there will be limits on the amount of alcohol and tobacco you can bring into the UK from the EU without paying extra duty. The right to live and work in the EUwill no longer be automatic for UK nationals, unless they already live in an EU country by the end of 2020. A new immigration systemwill come into force in the UK, involvinga points-based systemfor people wanting to work. Trade with the EUfor UK companies will involve customs declarations, extra border checks, certificates, licences and special labelling for some types of foods, plants and live animals. Correction 8 December: A previous version of this story said UK nationals would not need International Driving Permits in EU countries from 1 January next year. In fact, talks are still ongoing on this issue. Boris Johnson and the border blocking Brexit What could happen to food prices after Brexit?

Supermarkets will get 'grace period' for NI foodThe deal agreed by the UK and EU will give supermarkets time to adapt to deal with new Brexit checks.Northern IrelandComments,"Supermarkets will be given extra time to phase in new checks, ensuring food supplies from GB to Northern Ireland do not face disruption from 1 January - whether or not there is a Brexit deal. This will allow supermarkets to adapt their systems to deal with new Brexit controls required by the EU. It is part of the agreement reached between the UK and EU on how the new Irish Sea border will operate. The rules will apply whether or not the two sides can agree a trade deal. The so-called ""grace period"" will initially be for three months, with six months guaranteed for chilled meat products. The UK and EU have also agreed, under the part of the original withdrawal deal that deals with Northern Ireland - known as the NI Protocol: A trusted trader scheme, which means all goods going from Great Britain to Northern Ireland will not face any tariffs There will be no European Union embassy in Northern Ireland but Brussels officials will be permitted at border checks in the region once the transition period ends The supply of medicines from GB to Northern Ireland will also avoid disruption, with the industry granted a period of 12 months to adapt to the changes On Wednesday, Downing Street said""very large gaps remain between the two sides""on a trade deal after Prime Minister Boris Johnson met European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in Brussels. The leaders agreed that ""by Sunday a firm decision should be taken about the future of the talks"", a source told the BBC. Ursula von der Leyen confirmed that positions remained ""far apart"", adding that negotiating teams ""should immediately reconvene to try to resolve these essential issues"". ""We will come to a decision by the end of the weekend,"" she said. Outlining details of the agreement reached with the EU on the NI Protocol in parliament on Wednesday, Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove said the government had heard ""loud and clear"" the concerns of supermarket firms and that more flexibility was needed. From 1 January, Northern Ireland will stay in the EU single market for goods, but the rest of the UK will leave. That means a proportion of food products arriving in Northern Ireland from Great Britain will need to be checked. Michael Gove outlined the contents of the agreement in the House of Commons The EU has strict rules on products of animal origin: meat, milk, fish and eggs. These products must enter through a border control post where paperwork is checked and a proportion of goods are physically inspected. Several supermarket chains had warned the supply ofsome products from GB to NI could be reduced, due to extra administrative burdens. On Wednesday,Britain's biggest supermarket Tesco said it was stockpiling food ahead of a potential no-deal Brexit. Mr Gove said the agreement ""also prevents any disruption at the end of the transition period on the movements of chilled meats"". ""British sausages will continue to make their way to Belfast and Ballymena in the new year,"" he added. There is going to be a hard Brexit but the EU and UK are trying to give Northern Ireland a soft landing. The immediate fear about disruption to the flows of supermarket goods across the Irish Sea is addressed with a three-month ""grace period"". But what happens after that? Will there be time to negotiate a more durable arrangement or is this about giving supermarkets time to source more goods on the island of Ireland? And what about those food suppliers which aren't supermarkets? They are anxiously seeking more details. Read more:'Devil in detail' as NI deal gets guarded welcome But Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) Westminster leader, said ""safeguarding the union is not a three-month project"" - but an enduring commitment. He asked Mr Gove to commit, if necessary, to introducing ongoing ""safeguard measures"" to maintain unfettered access between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. The DUPhad opposed the protocol in Parliament, arguing it would create a divide between NI and the rest of the UK that threatened to break up the union. Brexit happened but rules didn't change at once:The UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020, but leaders needed time to negotiate a deal for life afterwards - they got 11 months. Talks are happening:The UK and the EU have until 31 December 2020 to agree a trade deal as well as other things, such as fishing rights. If there is no deal:Border checks and taxes will be introduced for goods travelling between the UK and the EU. But deal or no deal, we will still see changes. What happens next with Brexit? Mr Gove said the government had delivered on its commitment to ensure unfettered access for NI firms shipping goods to the rest of the UK. ""No additional requirements will be placed on NI businesses for these movements, with the very limited and specific exception of trade in endangered species and conflict diamonds,"" he said. Belfast Port will be one of the locations where officials will continue to enforce EU customs codes after 1 January The Northern Ireland Protocol created a category of ""at risk goods"". These are goods which the EU fear could travel from GB through NI into the Republic of Ireland and the wider EU, without paying the correct EU tariff. The protocol makes a provision for tariffs to be charged on these goods. It was feared that a large proportion of goods going from GB-NI could have attracted tariffs in this way. ""Internal UK trade will be protected as we promised - whether we have a free trade agreement or not,"" said Mr Gove. The ""at risk"" goods problem would be almost entirely solved if there was a trade deal between the EU and UK, eliminating tariffs on all goods. But in the absence of a trade deal the trusted trader scheme would minimise the issue. The government also confirmed there will be an EU presence in NI after 1 January, but Mr Gove said it would not amount to a ""Belfast mini-embassy"". ""The EU officials will not have any powers to carry out checks themselves,"" he said, adding there would be ""sensible and practical"" cooperation and data sharing on both sides. Downing Street said it remained committed to peace and prosperity in Northern Ireland and that NI Secretary Brandon Lewis would shortly set out further measures of financial support to help businesses and communities in NI. Its fundamental purpose is to prevent a hardening of the land border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. It does that by keeping Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods and by having Northern Ireland apply EU customs rules at its ports. That means goods arriving from Great Britain are supposed to be checked and controlled at Northern Ireland's ports from 1 January. This arrangement will apply whether or not a wider trade deal is agreed. It will also mean when relevant EU laws are amended or new ones are drawn up, they will apply in Northern Ireland. Under the plan, NI will leave the EU customs union with the rest of the UK at the end of this year, but will continue to enforce the EU's customs code at its ports.

"Covid not out of control in Wales, FM insistsThe first minister defends Wales' short autumn lockdown as he comes under fire for rising rates.Wales politics","Wales' coronavirus restrictions are set in Cardiff The coronavirus situation in Wales is ""very difficult"" but not out of control, according to the country's first minister. Mark Drakeford defended his government's decision to have a short lockdown of 17 days in the autumn. He has faced accusations from the opposition of losing his grip on Covid. It comes as Wales' top doctor says ministers are considering whether new measures might be needed before Christmas. Chief Medical Officer Frank Atherton warned there was ""serious pressure"" on the NHS in the country, particularly in south Wales. The government is already looking at what might be needed after the festive holiday, although the first minister had suggested on Tuesday that he would not impose new restrictions before Christmas. NHS staff sickness having 'huge impact' on care Pupils pulled from school in Christmas Covid fear Wales only part of UK without falling Covid rates Mr Drakeford has claimed that the recent rise in cases was partly due to people not being willing to follow the rules. As well as criticising the government's performance the Welsh Conservatives and Plaid Cymru called on ministers to think again about a ban on alcohol in pubs and restaurants in a debate on Wednesday. Health minister Vaughan Gething warned relaxing the measures would mean more people would die. On Tuesday it emerged the Welsh Government's own advisers warned the number of deaths had been abovethe worst case scenarioin recent weeks. Wales had 326.84 cases per 100,000 people in the seven days up to 5 December, up from 223.86 in the week up to 23 November. Dr Atherton said the rate is now almost 350 cases per 100,000 people. Meanwhile the chief medical officer called for people not to mix outside their householdin the run up to Christmas. By Ben Butcher, Reality Check In Wales, the increasing coronavirus rate is generally focused in the more densely populated parts of the country, which include the south and Wrexham, in the north east. Weekly rates are highest in Neath Port Talbot where there are 613 cases for every 100,000 people - twice the Welsh national rate. Rhondda, Blaenau Gwent, Merthyr Tydfil, Swansea and Torfaen are also recording case rates above 400 per 100,000, according to data collected by the UK government. Within these areas though, are particularly high pockets of coronavirus, including rates above 1,200 cases per 100,000 in Caerau in Bridgend, Aberdulais & Resolfen in Port Talbot and Ferndale & Maerdy, Rhondda. Neath Port Talbot with 26 deaths was ranked 19th highest across England and Wales in the latest week So, how does that compare with England? Nationally, England's case rate of 150 cases per 100,000 is roughly half that of Wales. And, with the exception of Medway, England currently has no local authorities with case rates higher than 400 cases per 100,000 people. However, there are small pockets in some areas with high case rates. This includes Great Chell, Stoke-on-Trent where cases are as high as 1,313 per 100,000 people - although mass testing might contribute to this. Chatham South and parts of Rochester in Medway also have high rates. These local hotspots could be due to an outbreak in a school, hospitals or workplaces, which can be controlled if found quickly. In October, many university towns and cities saw localised outbreaks on campuses, including Fallowfield in Manchester where the rate went as high as 7,574 cases per 100,000. Speaking to BBC Breakfast, Mr Drakeford said: ""The virus is in a very difficult position in Wales, I wouldn't describe it as out of control."" Mr Drakeford said he had taken action to bring the virus under control through his decision to ban the sale of alcohol in hospitality venues and close them in the evenings, ""in the teeth of opposition"", he said, ""from other parties"". Defending his government's handling of the crisis, he emphasised the personal responsibility of Welsh citizens in bringing rates down. He denied that Wales had come out of the firebreak too early: ""The firebreak period did everything that we had hoped. ""It set the clock back three weeks. It gave us three weeks where the R number was below one."" Mark Drakeford defended his decision making on coronavirus But those gains had waned since, Mr Drakeford said. ""And that is partly because despite the very strict rules we have here in Wales, fatigue - people's sense of no hope for the future - has meant that not everybody has been willing to abide by the restrictions that are still necessary."" After the firebreak Wales abandoned the system of local lockdowns, which had covered most of the population and effectively barred non-essential travel outside of county boundaries. But Mr Drakeford insisted that the post-firebreak rules ""were very strict"". ""They were stricter than the rules we had before we went into it, in restricting people's ability to meet inside homes and meeting in gardens, a smaller number of people able to meet outdoors and so on,"" he said. There will be less restrictive rules during Christmas Andrew RT Davies, the Welsh Conservative health spokesman, said: ""It would seem that there are those within the Welsh Labour-led Government speaking from different scripts. Messaging is confusing and contradictory. ""But this is set against the backdrop of the highest reported rates of deaths and new infections in the UK, and at the same time, the number of days a person needs to self-isolate forbeing reduced to 10. Hardly fitting into the narrative Labour's been pushing of keeping Wales safe."" Plaid Cymru health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth said: ""We all have a responsibility as individuals to do the right things to keep ourselves, our friends, families and communities safe. ""But government can't simply try to deflect all the blame onto others - ministers have to keep their side of the bargain by putting robust strategies in place, enforcing restrictions properly, communicating effectively and giving people the support they need to stop the spread of the virus."" ""Plaid Cymru called for more sustainable measures as we came out of the firebreak - including a more gradual easing of restrictions and optimising Wales' own testing capacity to reach the 24-hour turnaround timescale target. ""The Labour Welsh Government failed to do that and now hospitality is paying the price."" The grim figures on Covid cases, deaths and hospital inpatients are increasing the pressure on ministers. They say that the behaviour of some members of the public partly explains this picture. While no one can deny that the choices we make have consequences for Covid spread, public behaviour alone can't explain why Wales has become an outlier amongst the home nations - after all England, Scotland and Northern Ireland all have people making choices about their lives, just as we do in Wales. Policy decisions are relevant too and so is the timing of them. The first minister insists that the controversial hospitality restrictions will start to make a difference soon but the Christmas relaxation will likely push case rates in the wrong direction. That means more tough policy decisions are imminent. In the Senedd on Wednesday the Welsh Conservatives and Plaid Cymru called for measures introduced last Friday to ban the sale of alcohol in hospitality venues to be looked at again. The Conservative Darren Millar called for the ""immediate suspension"" of the regulations ""and for a more targeted and proportionate approach going forward"". ""We believe that the decision to impose severe restrictions on the hospitality and entertainment industries across Wales is neither proportionate nor reasonable,"" he said. Plaid Cymru's Rhun ap Iorwerth said his party wanted a rethink because ""elements of the nationwide restrictions were wrong"". Some people were ""questioning the logic"" of the latest measures, he said, because four people can meet for a coffee but ""not even an individual can have a quiet pint in the same establishment"". But the Health Minister Vaughan Gething said he hoped the ""sobering, troubling and undeniably serious figures of the last few days will have given all members the time to pause and reflect"". ""As we face the prospect of greater harm, as we face the prospect of a hard, difficult and deadly winter ahead of us without further changes, I hope that in the face of that prospect members will reflect on whether this Senedd should vote today to relax restrictions. ""I believe doing so will undoubtedly cause greater harm and undoubtedly will lead to avoidable deaths for the people we serve."" Independent Reform Alliance MS Caroline Jones said she was ""disappointed"" that the Senedd was simply being asked to ""rubber stamp decisions which have already been made"". ""This isn't democracy. This has become an elected dictatorship,"" she said. Senedd members voted to reject a series of opposition demands for changes to the strategy. Conservative calls for ministers to publish the evidence they based their decision for closing indoor entertainment venues on, and to make ""sufficient financial support available to businesses in a timely manner"", were supported by all the parties in the chamber. Members will vote on whether they approve the regulations themselves next week.

Currys agrees to honour lost Black Friday sales,"The firm says it experienced record demand on 27 November Currys PC World has said that customers who lost out on Black Friday deals because it cancelled their orders will be able to buy the goods again at the same discounted prices. The electronics retailer has blamed a website glitch for causing it to lose at least some of the sales involved. Its pledge comesafter the BBC reported cases of shoppers being toldthey would have to reorder and pay the full cost. The firm said it had yet to quantify how many people had been affected. ""We will be honouring promotional prices for any customer who placed an order between 25 November and 1 December and received an email confirmation of purchase but then had the order cancelled,"" a spokeswoman told the BBC. ""If we are out of stock on their item of choice we will give the customer a 10% discount off a similar product."" She added that a form would be added to the store's website by the end of Thursday to help those who qualify resolve the matter. Currys PC World - which is owned by Dixons Carphone - said it had experienced an ""unprecedented volume of customers"" on 27 November, which had caused its site to fail. The outage led it to lose details of transactions made via gift cards as well as some Order and Collect purchases. In addition, it said, some users who bought goods for home delivery via debit or credit cards had their orders cancelled for other reasons. Many of the firm's stores were closed because of coronavirus restrictions, putting more pressure on the website Many customers did not suspect there was an issue as they had been sent an order confirmation email. And they only discovered there was a problem after the sale ended when they contacted the firm to chase up undelivered items or arrived to pick up goods. ""I waited in all day [for the delivery], rang them up and they said it had been cancelled,"" one Surrey-based shopper who had ordered two computers told the BBC. ""It was very disappointing. I could have obtained the laptops from Amazon, and like my son said I probably should have."" Another from North Ayrshire who had tried to buy a discounted television said: ""I had to take it upon myself to contact them to find out what was happening with my order just to be told that due to their own fault I wouldn't be receiving [the TV] for the price I had ordered it for - I was very angry."" The store has now told its customer service team to honour the original sales prices and it intends to contact shoppers who had previously been given different advice. The law does not oblige retailers to honour discounts on cancelled orders so long as money is not taken from customers' accounts. However, the consumer rights group Which? had earlier suggested Currys PC World's reputation was on the line. ""The tech retailer has earned itself a poor reputation for customer service and in a recent Which? survey received just two stars for its after-sales service,"" said the organisation's consumer rights expert Adam French. ""The company must up its game or customers will rightly go looking elsewhere for a good deal.""

Man jailed for murdering niece in woods,"Louise Smith had moved in with her aunt who is married to Shane Mays A man has been jailed for life for murdering his teenage niece in woodland and violating and burning her body. Louise Smith, 16, was found dead at Havant Thicket, Hampshire, on 21 May - 13 days after she went missing. Her uncle Shane Mays, 30, was previously found guilty of murder by a jury at Winchester Crown Court. Imposing a minimum term of 25 years, the judge, Mrs Justice May, said he had committed ""the most gross abuse of trust"". Shane Mays was jailed for a minimum of 25 years Louise went to live with her aunt and Mays, who was her uncle through marriage, in late April after an argument with her mother. Mays ""flirted"" with the ""anxious and vulnerable"" teenager, including by tickling her feet in a video found on her phone, his trial was told. The defendant, who had admitted manslaughter, told the jury the teenager lured him to woods to ""bond"" with him. This video can not be played Louise Smith filmed a video showing her killer Shane Mays tickling her feet Giving evidence, Mays said he became enraged when she hit him with a stick during an argument over drugs. He told the court he did not know how many times he punched her as she lay on the ground, only stopping when he heard her moaning. The defendant, of Ringwood House, Leigh Park, said someone else must have later interfered with and burned her body. Louise's father Bradley Smith said he was ""tortured by nightmares"" while her mother Rebbecca Cooper described Mays as a ""monster"" Louise suffered ""repeated, heavy blows"" to the head but the cause of death could not be determined due to the fire, the jury was told. Mays, who was assessed by a psychologist as having an extremely low IQ of 63, said he forgot what he had done until he was in prison on remand in June. This video can not be played The last known footage of Louise Smith was shown in court In a victim personal statement read out in court, Louise's mother Rebbecca Cooper said her ""strong-willed, happy, smiley"" daughter had ""the whole world to look forward to"". Addressing Mays, she said: ""You killed her in such a traumatic way and what you did afterwards is beyond words. You are a monster... ""You damaged her so bad that I didn't have a chance to say goodbye, hold her hand or even kiss her. I will never forgive you for this."" A statement from the teenager's father, Bradley Smith, said he was ""tortured by nightmares"" and felt he might ""never recover"". This video can not be played CCTV showed Shane Mays buying pizzas after killing Louise Smith Rejecting a whole life term for Mays, the judge said she could not be sure that the murder was ""sexually motivated"". ""Shane Mays was in a position of trust in relation to Louise; theirs was like a father-daughter relationship,"" she said. ""That being, he committed the most gross abuse of trust."" She added: ""Louise had all her life before her. Her death was bleak, dreadfully so... She was grotesquely and cruelly injured and her body defiled."" Det Insp Adam Edwards, of Hampshire Constabulary, said: ""Mays has shown no remorse throughout this case, and has lied to police in a bid to deflect any blame for Louise's murder away from himself. ""I am pleased that the jury were able to see through these lies."" Hampshire Safeguarding Children Partnership said it was reviewing how authorities had cared for Louise, who had an allocated social worker.

LiveLiveUK PM and EU chief in bid to unlock Brexit talks2 minutes ago2 minutes ago WATCH: Johnson arrives at EmbassyWATCH: Johnson arrives at Embassy4 minutes ago So what will they discuss tonight?So what will they discuss tonight?13 minutes ago Known unknownsKnown unknownsLive UK PM and EU chief in bid to unlock Brexit talks  2 minutes ago,"Talks have ended in Brussels between Boris Johnson and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen Downing Street said ""very large gaps remain between the two sides and it is still unclear whether these can be bridged"" The two leaders will come to a decision about the future of the talks by Sunday Johnson and von der Leyen were working through a list of sticking points that have so far blocked a Brexit trade deal being agreed Three ""critical issues"" need to be resolved - fishing rights, government support for industry and how a deal is enforced Time is running out to reach a deal before 31 December, when the UK stops following EU trading rules. The UK left the EU on 31 January, but remains under its trading rules until the end of the year If a deal is not agreed by then, tariffs - or taxes on goods - could come into force Jennifer Scott and Paul Seddon We're leaving it there for our live coverage this evening. As Boris Johnson returns to London after his Brussels dinner with Ursula von der Leyen the fate of Brexit trade talks hangs in the balance. To recap: The team with you tonight were Jennifer Scott, Paul Seddon and editing Johanna Howitt. Thanks for following along with us. Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent So No 10 describes tonightâs talks as âfrankâ, while Ursula von der Leyen says they were âlivelyâ. All diplomatic speak,
surely, for a difficult evening, and thatâs evidenced by whatâs come from it. Large gaps remain between the two sides, we're told. The point of this dinner
was to try and gives the negotiations, which had stalled, a political push. But itâs far from clear that the negotiators will enter the room tomorrow with
any kind of fresh mandate, or any more flexibility, than they had before. Meanwhile, Sunday is the latest deadline. A government source tonight said it really will be a firm end point - a day to decide whether a deal can be
done or if itâs time to walk away. Brexit deadlines have been missed before, of
course, but the ticking clock of the transition period tells us this canât go on
much longer. We now have an official statement from No 10 on tonight's meeting and here it is in full: The prime minister and President von der Leyen met for dinner in Brussels this evening.  The leaders had a frank discussion about the state of play in the negotiations. They acknowledged that the situation remained very difficult and there were still major differences between the two sides.  They agreed that chief negotiators would continue talks over the next few days and that a firm decision should be taken about the future of the talks by Sunday.  The prime minister is determined not to leave any route to a fair deal untested, but any agreement must respect the independence and sovereignty of the UK. Downing Street spokesman UK PM Boris Johnson leaving the talks in Brussels earlier The SNP's leader in Westminster is warning against the ""self-harm"" of leaving the EU without a deal. Ian Blackford took to Twitter after the news broke from the Brussels dinner, saying: ""A no deal would be a massive failure of diplomacy and leadership which Boris Johnson has to take ownership of."" He said it would do particular damage in light of the ""health and economic impact"" of coronavirus. And he added: ""Disruption to trade, tariffs, higher prices and lost jobs is never a price worth paying."" Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick says he does not want to ""give false hope"" about getting a trade deal with the EU. Speaking to ITV's Peston programme, he said he had talked to the prime minister's team tonight and there were ""still very significant areas of disagreement"" between the UK and EU. He admitted things were getting close to the wire with the transition period deadline looming. And he said Sunday would be the ""decision point... whether ultimately there is a deal to be done or to accept disagreements are too great and we need to move forward"". But Jenrick promised ""concerted efforts to break those divides"" between the two negotiating teams, even if he believed the UK would ""thrive under any arrangement"" - or lack thereof. Since the news broke in Brussels that the latest Brexit talks hadended without clear agreementon a UK-EU trade deal, the UK newspaper front pages have started to come in. Both sides said a decision on the future of the talks should be taken by Sunday. Downing Street has published a number of pictures from the meeting in Brussels tonight... First, from left to right, is the UK's chief Brexit negotiator, Lord David Frost, Prime Minister Boris Johnson, European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, and EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier Here are the two leaders just before heading into the dinner, discussing when to wear a mask ""After you prime minister"" - Von der Leyen points the way into the meeting We've just heard from European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who says her three-hour long dinner with UK PM Boris Johnson tonight was ""a lively and interesting discussion"" on ""outstanding issues"":  "" We had a lively & interesting discussion on the state of play on outstanding issues. We gained a clear understanding of each otherÂ´s positions. They remain far apart. ""We agreed that the teams should immediately reconvene to try to resolve these essential issues.  ""We will come to a decision by the end of the weekend."" Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor It's been made clear Downing Street that tonight's meeting has not gone well. Reading between the lines, it appears tonight has been far from any kind of breakthrough. But in politics, in the whole Brexit process, the distance been Wednesday and Sunday is a very, very long time. So while this appears tonight towards being a big and significant step towards leaving the transition period without a firm arrangement in place, it's still not impossible a deal could happen. Labour's shadow Cabinet Office minister, Rachel Reeves, is one of the first UK opposition MPs to respond to the news from Brussels. She says the prime minister ""promised an oven ready deal"" for Brexit, and now ""needs to get it done so we can focus on what matters to the British people"". Allow Twitter content?

Talks between the UK and the EU are under way, in an attempt to secure a post-Brexit trade deal. If no agreement is reached by 31 December, charges will be introduced on many things the UK buys and sells, which could push up prices. But what is a trade deal, and how many has the UK struck around the world since it left the EU in January? You can read more here.  BBC Politics We are all waiting to find out how the meeting is going between the leaders. We know Johnson arrived shortly after 19:00 GMT, and they have been locked in a room since then discussing a future deal. But a spokesman from No 10 said the dinner was ongoing at 21:30 GMT. That's one lengthy meal... UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson arriving in Brussels earlier for talks with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen In the last post we mentioned that, even though the UK left the EU on 31 January it continued to follow EU rules. And it will do so until 31 December. That 11 month gap is known as the transition period - or implementation period. So what is the transition period and why is it necessary? In short - yes - the UK has already signed a deal with the European Union. That was thewithdrawal agreement- or the 'divorce deal' - which passed in 2019, setting out the terms of the UKâs exit from the EU. Tonight's talks are about the next step: the possibility of a new trade agreement between the two sides. If they were to strike deal - it would set out new joint rules on how they do business with each other in the future. But time is running out - the UK will stop following current EU trading rules on 31 December. And just to quickly recap - UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen are meeting right now in Brussels to try to find a breakthrough in the âsignificant differences"" that remain on getting a deal.  BBC News Channel Tom Tugendhat also chairs the Commons foreign affairs committee. So that's who Ursula von der Leyen is, but why is she talking to Boris Johnson tonight? Well, it's because she's in charge of the European Commission, the Brussels-based body negotiating a trade deal on behalf of the 27 EU countries. But it's worth remembering that ultimately, the Commission negotiators will be taking their instructions from the European governments they represent. Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat tells BBC News this means Mrs von der Leyen is ""a bit like the lawyer
you hire to sell your house, or to buy somebody elseâsâ. ""Her room for manoeuvre is very limited,â he adds. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Human-made objects to outweigh living thingsThe mass of human-made objects will for the first time likely exceed that of living things in 2020.Science & EnvironmentComments,"Buildings and roads make up the majority of human-made mass Scientists say the weight of human-made objects will likely exceed that of living things by the end of the year. In other words, the combined weight of all the plastic, bricks, concrete and other things we've made in the world will outweigh all animals and plants on the planet for the first time. The estimated weight of human-made objects is about one teratonne. For every person in the world, more than their body weight in stuff is now being produced each week. These astonishing figures have been calculated by a team at the Weizmann Institute of Sciences in Rehovot, Israel, to show how our species is transforming the Earth. ""The significance is symbolic in the sense that it tells us something about the major role that humanity now plays in shaping the world and the state of the Earth around us,"" Dr Ron Milo, who led the research, told BBC News. ""It is a reason for all of us to ponder our role, how much consumption we do and how can we try to get a better balance between the living world and humanity."" Plastic heading for oceans quantified 'Case is made' for Anthropocene Epoch Search for Anthropocene 'golden spike' Since the first agricultural revolution, humans have halved plant biomass The scientists worked out the combined mass of all human-made stuff from 1900 to the present day and compared this with the weight of all the living things on the planet (known as biomass). From plastic bottles to the bricks and concretes we use for buildings and roads, the weight of all the things we produce has been doubling every 20 years recently. At the same time, the weight of living things has been falling, mainly due to the loss of plant life in forests and natural spaces. The scientists knew at some point we would reach a crossover point. And according to their estimates, 2020 is the year when human-made mass from the likes of roads, buildings and machines, will likely overtake that of all the living things in the world. The exact timing is sensitive to definitions, so there may be some variability in the estimates by a few years either side, they say. But if we continue as we are, by 2040, the weight of all human-made stuff will have almost tripled from 1.1 teratonnes (1,100,000,000,000 tonnes) to about three teratonnes. Buildings and roads make up the majority of human-made mass This means humanity is now producing stuff at a rate of more than 30 gigatonnes (30,000,000,000 tonnes) per year. The research, published in Nature, is further evidence that we have entered a new geological age, known as the Anthropocene, where humanity's impacts on Earth will be visible in sediments and rocks millions of years into the future. The formal start date could be the 1950s, which marks the beginning of the ""Great Acceleration"", when the human population and its consumption patterns suddenly speeded up. It coincides with the spread of ubiquitous materials, such as aluminium, concrete and plastic. Follow Helen onTwitter,external.

Cambridge University votes to protect free speech,"A vote on free speech at Cambridge University has strongly rejected guidelines requiring opinions to be ""respectful"" - after warnings this could limit freedom of expression. Instead the policy on free speech will support ""tolerance"" of differing views. The proposed rules would have required staff, students and visiting speakers to remain ""respectful"" of the views and ""identities"" of others. But there were claims this would block controversial ideas and debates. The university's governing body, the Regent House, has voted by a big majority in support of amendments from those worried about a threat to academic freedom, introducing a commitment to ""tolerance"" rather than ""respect"". The revised wording on free speech ensures the right to express ""controversial or unpopular opinions within the law, without fear of intolerance or discrimination"". The guidelines, adopted after the vote, will expect ""staff, students and visitors to be tolerant of the differing opinions of others"". There is also an assertion of the need to hear from outside speakers, even if controversial, as long as they remain within the law. Is free speech under threat in universities? Free speech row over new hate crime bill The row at Cambridge, which gained attention in terms of wider ""culture wars"" and a so-called ""cancel culture"", was prompted by the university's plan to update a statement on how it upholds free speech. The proposal that views would have to remain ""respectful"" prompted complaints from some academics, who argued that controversial opinions or subjects could be blocked if they were accused of being disrespectful or causing offence. There were also concerns about having to be respectful to claims or concerns, regardless of their merit. The academics, headed by reader in philosophy Arif Ahmed, put forward an amendment saying that free speech should operate without ""fear of intolerance"". This was backed by Professor Ross Anderson who argued that requiring ""respect"" would undermine the ""freedom to question"", with academics being afraid to examine controversial views in case they were reported for being disrespectful to the opinions of others. ""It's our duty to tolerate colleagues even when they say things that we consider foolish, when we find their views offensive we should point that out politely. We should not be running to the vice chancellor asking him to censor them,"" said Prof Anderson. The actor Stephen Fry was among those worried about the threat to free speech - saying calls for ""respect"" might have been well-intentioned, but people could not ""demand"" that their views would always be respected by others. The university's vice chancellor, Stephen Toope, said the aim had been to protect the ""core values"" of freedom of speech, but also ""recognising the need to maintain civility in debate"". The outcome of the vote was an ""emphatic reaffirmation of free speech in our university,"" said Prof Toope.

Queen's granddaughter Zara expecting third child,"Zara and Mike Tindall have two daughters, Mia, six, and Lena, two The Queen's granddaughter Zara Tindall is expecting her third child, her husband has announced. Former England rugby player Mike Tindall revealed a ""third Tindall"" is ""on its way"" in a podcast he co-hosts. The couple have two daughters, Mia, six, and Lena, two, and Mr Tindall said he ""would like a boy"". The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh, who already have eight great-grandchildren, were ""delighted"" to hear the news, Buckingham Palace said. ""It's been a good week for me, had a little scan last week - third Tindall on its way,"" Mr Tindall, 42, said during an episode of The Good, The Bad and The Rugby.

Zara Tindall reveals second miscarriage Royal Family tree and line of succession Former equestrian champion Mrs Tindall, 39,has spoken about suffering two miscarriages before having her second child. She said for a time ""you don't talk about it because it's too raw"" but ""as with everything, time's a great healer"". Mr Tindall said: ""Z is very good, always careful because of things that have happened in the past, and really looking forward to it."" Last month, the Duchess of Sussex alsorevealed she had a miscarriage in July. Mrs Tindall, who is the daughter of the Queen's only daughter, the Princess Royal, married Mr Tindall in 2011. They live at Princess Anne's estate in Gatcombe, Gloucester. As a member of the Great Britain eventing team, Mrs Tindall won the Eventing World Championship in 2006 and was named BBC Sports Personality later that year, before securing a silver medal at the London 2012 Olympics.

for following our live coverage of the pandemic. Today's
live page was edited by Helier Cheung and Sarah Collerton and written by Becky
Morton, Joshua Nevett and Alex Therrien. We'll
be back with all the latest updates tomorrow morning. Margaret Keenan, the first person to receive the Pfizer vaccine outside medical trials, left hospital on Wednesday Weâre wrapping up our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic for the day soon. Before we do, letâs have a look at the stories that made headlines today, the 273rd day since a pandemic was declared by the World Health Organization (WHO). In the UK:  Elsewhere: Alistair ColemanBBC Monitoring Some people are claiming that this vaccine event was staged The roll-out of a coronavirus vaccine in the UK was met immediately - and predictably - by an uptick in misinformation and false claims online. Among posts on social media are claims that patients and
medical staff seen on television âwerenât real peopleâ, and that a âfake
vaccination eventâ was staged for the media. Although on the face of it these wild claims are
preposterous, we checked anyway â and found the theories full of holes. Take one allegation that gained traction on Twitter â that
yesterdayâs vaccination footage first appeared on CNNâs website in October. This, however, is a characteristic of the CNN websiteâs
video player - a feature used by many news organisations. What readers actually saw was a constantly updated playlist
of relevant stories, meaning new videos appear on older stories. Other untrue claims were even more contrived, alleging
actors and bizarre secret codes. One feature they seem to have in common is the lack of any real evidence. Weâve been tracking some of the more popular anti-vaccine conspiracy theories during the pandemic- theories that are far from legitimate questions or reports, such as todayâs reports of allergic reactions. The military has helped set up the testing site at Rochester Cathedral The crypt of England's second oldest cathedral has been turned into a coronavirus testing centre. Rochester Cathedral, which has stood in Medway, Kent, for some 1,400 years, is one of the area's new targeted community testing centres being run in partnership with the military. The county has some of the highest case numbers in the country and was recently placed under tier three - the highest level of restrictions in England. Residents without symptoms are being encouraged to book a test to help tackle a rise in infections. This video can not be played Covid: 'Don't mix with other outside household' plea People in Wales have been urged not to mix with others outside of their household between now and Christmas. The country's chief medical officer, Frank Atherton, told a Welsh government briefing: ""The best present we can give our families this year is a coronavirus-free Christmas."" Groups of four people from different householdsare allowed to meetindoors at pubs, cafes and restaurants. Previously the Welsh government had said people should limit themselves to seeing thesame ""one or two friends"". Dr Atherton said: ""We all have to work to reduce the number of people we have contact with between now and Christmas. ""My message on this is really very simple - don't mix with people outside your household between now and Christmas."" Read more  Oregon has experienced a surge in infections in recent weeks (file photo) A nurse in Oregon has been fired after claiming she does not
follow pandemic restrictions outside of her job. In a TikTok video apparently filmed in her hospitalâs break room,
Ashley Grames â a cancer nurse â said she does not wear a mask away from work.
She added that she still travels and lets her children have play dates. The now-deleted video caused a stir on social media, forcing Ms
Gramesâ employer Salem Health to condemn her behaviour andplace her on administrative leavepending an
investigation. The hospital told local media on Tuesday that it no longer employs
Ms Grames. State records also indicate she will stop practising nursing for
the time being, an agreement that will remain in effect until the state board
of nursing allows her to practice again. Oregon has experienced a surge of the virus over the past few
weeks, setting records in daily caseloads and hospital admissions. After the first Covid-19 peak in April, cases in the UK started rising again in July, with the rate of growth increasing sharply in September and October, before falling again in November following tougher restrictions. The rate of decline now appears to have slowed, with a further 16,578 confirmed cases announced by the government on Wednesday. It is thought the infection rate was much higher during the first peak in spring, but testing capacity at the time was too limited to detect the true number of daily cases. Lockdowns worldwide have reduced carbon emissions Flights have been grounded. Fewer cars have been on the roads. Economic activity has slowed. The coronavirus pandemic has brought much of life as we know it to a halt. As a result, carbon emissions are predicted to fall by about 7% globally this year,according to a new report by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP),external. Yet, this yearâs projected reduction in greenhouse gases will have a ânegligibleâ impact on climate change, the report says. The forecasted dip, it says, only translates to a 0.01C reduction of global warming by 2050. Such a reduction would do little to keep global temperatures within 2C of pre-industrial levels, the target set bythe Paris Agreement on climate change. A green pandemic recovery, however, can bring emissions close to levels needed to achieve the 2C goal by 2030, the report adds. While the report looks at the plans that governments have submitted to curb their CO2, it also examines the roles of lifestyles and consumption patterns of individuals. It says that the top 10% of earners would need to cut their carbon footprints to around one tenth of their current level to help restrict the rise in temperatures this century to 1.5C You can read more about these findingshere. The airline industry has been scuppered by the pandemic Robin Levinson KingBBC News, Toronto Canada hasofficially approved Pfizer's coronavirus vaccine, which means the first doses could be delivered by the end of the month. The drug will be indicated for people over 16-years-old, while its use in children continues to be studied, the health department said. Earlier this week, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said 249,000 doses could go out to people in long term-care homes as early as the end of December. In total, the Canadian government has purchased 20 million doses of the vaccine - enough to inoculate 10 million people - with the option to buy 56 million more. The country's population is about 37 million. That gives Canada the most doses per capita than anywhere else in the world,according to a recent study.,external Amnesty International has accused Canada,externaland other rich countries of ""hoarding"" the vaccine, and says it could lead to more deaths in the developing world. Maddy SavageBBC News, Stockholm Swedenâs capital has almost reached its limit for providing intensive care beds for the first time during the pandemic, with 99% of all spots filled with serious Covid-19 cases alongside other patients, according to BjÃ¶rn Eriksson, Health and Medical care director for the Stockholm region. He told a news conference that his team had thought they were seeing a âplateau or the beginning of a declineâ of coronavirus admissions, but that the opposite had happened. In a separate interview with major Swedish daily newspaper Dagens Nyheter, he admitted there was a risk that some patients in need of care may not be able to receive it, describing a âvery serious situationâ. Earlier this week intensive care staff from Blekinge in southern Sweden were called in to help doctors at Stockholmâs largest hospital, Karolinska. Sweden, which relied largely on voluntary social distancing guidelines at the start of the pandemic, has recently toughened its restrictions, banning public gatherings of more than eight people and alcohol sales after 10pm. Students over the age of 16 have also switched back to distance-learning, having returned to classrooms in August. However there are ongoing concerns about overcrowding in shops and on public transport. On Tuesday, Health Minister Lena Hallengren promised that everyone aged over 18 would be offered a Covid-19 vaccine within the first six months of 2021. The Pfizer/BioNtech vaccine must be stored at a temperature of -70C We can bring you a response from US Health Secretary Alex Azar to the vaccine advice issued by UK regulators earlier today. UK regulators have advised people with a history of significant allergic reactions against taking the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine. That's because two people had a reaction shortly after having the new jab, though they received treatment and are both fine now (read more about thishere). The vaccine is yet to be approved by the USâs regulatory body, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA),though it has found no safety concerns yet. In an interview with broadcaster CNN,external, Azar was asked if the advice issued in the UK would have any impact on the regulatory authorisation of the vaccine in the US. He said the FDA would examine the data on allergic reactions and speak to UK regulators. âFDA is going to not cut any corners,â Azar said. âTheyâre looking at the data. Theyâre looking under the hood at everything. So Iâm sure thatâll be something the FDA looks at here.â Helier CheungBBC News Hong Kong has had 7,180 coronavirus cases and 114 deaths Hong Kong is struggling under what officials are calling a ""fourth wave"". For several days in the past two weeks, the territory has seen more than 100 new infections per day - a sharp contrast from earlier this year, when the city seemed to have the outbreak contained, and some days with zero local transmissions. Now, authorities have banned dining in restaurants after 6pm - a significant move in a city where many work long hours, and eating out in an essential part of local culture. The government has also orderedcompulsory Covid-19 testing for taxi drivers,externalworking between over Christmas and January, and for residents oftwo housing estate blocks with clusters of infections,external. Mandatory testing is a touchy subject to some in Hong Kong - some activists have raised concerns that testing could be used to collect DNA samples for surveillance purposes - claims the authorities have dismissed as a smear campaign. A survey last month,externalfound 49% of people said they did not trust the government (compared to 30% who said they did). However, attitudes may be changing as infection numbers rise, says Victoria Hui, a Hong Konger and politics professor at Notre Dame University. ""While people didn't want to sign up before, there seems to be more acceptance of testing now... Covid-19 now seems to be the immediate concern, with the possibility of DNA collection becoming a secondary concern,"" she told the BBC. Margaret Keenan left hospital with her daughter Sue The 90-year-old grandmotherwho became the first person in the world to have the Pfizer vaccinehas been discharged from hospital. Margaret Keenan was admitted to University Hospital Coventry a few days before she was given the jab early on Tuesday. Mrs Keenan, who turns 91 next week, said the injection was the ""best early birthday present"". It was the first of 800,000 doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine that will be dispensed in the UK in the coming weeks. Burley is likely to be off screen until the New Year Sky News presenter Kay Burley and three colleagueshave been taken off airwhile an investigation into breaches of Covid guidelines is carried out. Political editor Beth Rigby, north of England correspondent Inzamam Rashid and presenter Sam Washington are off air while the inquiry takes place. BBC media editor Amol Rajan said Burley's job was hanging in the balance. It follows Burley's admission that she ""inadvertently broke the rules"" while celebrating her 60th birthday at the weekend. The journalist said she could ""only apologise"" for her ""error of judgment"". Writing on Twitter on Monday,external, Burley said she had been at a ""Covid compliant"" restaurant on Saturday and had later ""popped into another"" venue to use the toilet. Beth Rigby has also been taken off air Amol Rajan said she was one of a party of 10 people at the Century Club, a private members' club on London's Shaftesbury Avenue. Her group took up two tables, with six people on one and four on the other. Burley then went on to Folie restaurant, where she used the toilet, before moving on to a private residence where individuals from at least three households mixed, Rajan said. London is under tier two restrictions, which means people are not allowed to socialise with anyone from outside their household or support bubble indoors, either in a private home or a public place. The EU regulatory body is assessing whether Covid-19 vaccines are safe for use in European countries The medicines regulator for the European Union (EU) says it has been the victim of a cyber-attack. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) is currently working on approval of two Covid-19 vaccines, which it expects to conclude within weeks. The EMA did not say what the nature of the cyber-attack was, if it was successful, or if it was linked to the vaccine approval process. The agency authorises the use of medicines across the EU. It is trying to decide if the Pfizer/BioNTech jab - which is being rolled out in the UK - and another made by Moderna, are safe for use in EU countries. There has been a string of warnings about hacking threats against vaccine-makers and public health bodies. Security serviceswarned in the summer that Russian intelligencehad been targeting organisations attempting to develop a successful vaccine. Read the full story Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Care home worker Pillay Jagambrun, 61, receiving the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine on Tuesday One of the big unknowns about the vaccines that are being developed is whether they prevent people from passing on the virus. The trials that have taken place have only established that they stop people getting ill. But it is quite possible that someone who is vaccinated could still infect others. The assumption is vaccination will at least disrupt this to some extent - but it may not end transmission completely. For that reason, those who are vaccinated will still be expected to wear masks and self-isolate if they are a close contact of someone who is infected. That does not mean these precautions can never be lifted. Once all the vulnerable people are immunised, there will be a strong case that these steps are not needed â or at least not needed on the scale they are currently being used. However, it will take many months to get to that point. Masks, self-isolation and social distancing are here for a while. Marianna SpringSpecialist disinformation reporter Patricia from Texas is suffering from an unexplained skin condition on her feet - but a misunderstanding about what might have caused it set off a chain of events that turned her into fodder for anti-vaccine activists. Mistaken claims she was injured in a vaccine trial were shared on a fundraiser page. That fuelled rumours and conspiracy theories. They all were based on the idea that Patricia had received the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. She had been part of a trial, but medical records show that instead of the vaccine itself, she received a placebo, a small injection of salt water. Dermatologists confirmed that such an injection would not cause a skin reaction. That didn't stop activists twisting her story to advance their own agendas. The disinformation they fuelled online is worlds apart from legitimate safety concerns and todayâs reports about allergic reactions. On top of the physical pain caused by her condition, Patricia received a wave of online abuse. Read more The Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine has been deemed safe for use by regulators in Canada, paving the way for mass vaccination in the country. Health Canada approved the Covid-19 vaccine on Wednesday, shortly after the UK's move at the start of December. ""The approval of the vaccine is supported by evidence that it is safe, effective and of good quality,"" Health Canada said in a statement. On Monday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Canadians would start receiving their first doses of Pfizer's vaccine before the end of December. A further 533 coronavirus deaths have been recorded in the UK, taking the total number of people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for the virus to 62,566. The latest government figures,externalalso show there have been a further 16,578 cases across the UK. James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News Thestory about two people having allergic reactionsto the Pfizer/BioNTech jab is one to assess with your head and not your gut. No effective medicine is without side effects so you have to balance the risk and the benefit. Remember, one in 1,000 people in the UK have died after being infected with coronavirus this year and that figure is rising daily. Two people, out of thousands vaccinated yesterday, had an allergic reaction which they recovered from. Such reactions can happen with any vaccine and are treated with drugs such as steroids or adrenaline. The trials reportedone possible allergic reaction,externalper 1,000 people immunised that may have been related to the jab. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency has given targeted advice to those most at risk, but for the overwhelming majority of people this changes nothing.

Four charged over toppling of Colston statue,"The bronze statue was thrown into Bristol harbour after being pulled down and rolled through the streets in June Four people have been charged with criminal damage over the toppling of the statue of Edward Colston. Rhian Graham, 29, Milo Ponsford, 25, Jake Skuse, 32, and Sage Willoughby, 21, are all due to appear at Bristol Magistrates' Court on 25 January. The 17th Century slave trader's statue was pulled down on June 7 during a Black Lives Matter protest in Bristol. Six people have already accepted conditional cautionsfor criminal damage for their part in the incident. The CPS said it had authorised charges following a review of a file of evidence from Avon and Somerset Police. The bronze memorial to the controversial figure was dumped in Bristol harbour by protesters after it was pulled down. The statue of Edward Colston was erected in 1895 It was recovered four days later by Bristol City Council and assessed to have suffered Â£3,750 worth of damage. The city council carried out preservation work on the statue and it is expected to be given a new home in a city museum. The city divided by a slave trader's legacy Colston made his fortune in the slave trade and bequeathed his money to charities in Bristol, which led to many venues, streets and landmarks bearing his name. Following the toppling of the statue, Colston's Girls School changed its name to Montpelier High School and the city's Colston Hall music venue is now known as the Bristol Beacon.

for following our live coverage of the pandemic. Today's
live page was edited by Helier Cheung and Sarah Collerton and written by Becky
Morton, Joshua Nevett and Alex Therrien. We'll
be back with all the latest updates tomorrow morning. Margaret Keenan, the first person to receive the Pfizer vaccine outside medical trials, left hospital on Wednesday Weâre wrapping up our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic for the day soon. Before we do, letâs have a look at the stories that made headlines today, the 273rd day since a pandemic was declared by the World Health Organization (WHO). In the UK:  Elsewhere: Alistair ColemanBBC Monitoring Some people are claiming that this vaccine event was staged The roll-out of a coronavirus vaccine in the UK was met immediately - and predictably - by an uptick in misinformation and false claims online. Among posts on social media are claims that patients and
medical staff seen on television âwerenât real peopleâ, and that a âfake
vaccination eventâ was staged for the media. Although on the face of it these wild claims are
preposterous, we checked anyway â and found the theories full of holes. Take one allegation that gained traction on Twitter â that
yesterdayâs vaccination footage first appeared on CNNâs website in October. This, however, is a characteristic of the CNN websiteâs
video player - a feature used by many news organisations. What readers actually saw was a constantly updated playlist
of relevant stories, meaning new videos appear on older stories. Other untrue claims were even more contrived, alleging
actors and bizarre secret codes. One feature they seem to have in common is the lack of any real evidence. Weâve been tracking some of the more popular anti-vaccine conspiracy theories during the pandemic- theories that are far from legitimate questions or reports, such as todayâs reports of allergic reactions. The military has helped set up the testing site at Rochester Cathedral The crypt of England's second oldest cathedral has been turned into a coronavirus testing centre. Rochester Cathedral, which has stood in Medway, Kent, for some 1,400 years, is one of the area's new targeted community testing centres being run in partnership with the military. The county has some of the highest case numbers in the country and was recently placed under tier three - the highest level of restrictions in England. Residents without symptoms are being encouraged to book a test to help tackle a rise in infections. This video can not be played Covid: 'Don't mix with other outside household' plea People in Wales have been urged not to mix with others outside of their household between now and Christmas. The country's chief medical officer, Frank Atherton, told a Welsh government briefing: ""The best present we can give our families this year is a coronavirus-free Christmas."" Groups of four people from different householdsare allowed to meetindoors at pubs, cafes and restaurants. Previously the Welsh government had said people should limit themselves to seeing thesame ""one or two friends"". Dr Atherton said: ""We all have to work to reduce the number of people we have contact with between now and Christmas. ""My message on this is really very simple - don't mix with people outside your household between now and Christmas."" Read more  Oregon has experienced a surge in infections in recent weeks (file photo) A nurse in Oregon has been fired after claiming she does not
follow pandemic restrictions outside of her job. In a TikTok video apparently filmed in her hospitalâs break room,
Ashley Grames â a cancer nurse â said she does not wear a mask away from work.
She added that she still travels and lets her children have play dates. The now-deleted video caused a stir on social media, forcing Ms
Gramesâ employer Salem Health to condemn her behaviour andplace her on administrative leavepending an
investigation. The hospital told local media on Tuesday that it no longer employs
Ms Grames. State records also indicate she will stop practising nursing for
the time being, an agreement that will remain in effect until the state board
of nursing allows her to practice again. Oregon has experienced a surge of the virus over the past few
weeks, setting records in daily caseloads and hospital admissions. After the first Covid-19 peak in April, cases in the UK started rising again in July, with the rate of growth increasing sharply in September and October, before falling again in November following tougher restrictions. The rate of decline now appears to have slowed, with a further 16,578 confirmed cases announced by the government on Wednesday. It is thought the infection rate was much higher during the first peak in spring, but testing capacity at the time was too limited to detect the true number of daily cases. Lockdowns worldwide have reduced carbon emissions Flights have been grounded. Fewer cars have been on the roads. Economic activity has slowed. The coronavirus pandemic has brought much of life as we know it to a halt. As a result, carbon emissions are predicted to fall by about 7% globally this year,according to a new report by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP),external. Yet, this yearâs projected reduction in greenhouse gases will have a ânegligibleâ impact on climate change, the report says. The forecasted dip, it says, only translates to a 0.01C reduction of global warming by 2050. Such a reduction would do little to keep global temperatures within 2C of pre-industrial levels, the target set bythe Paris Agreement on climate change. A green pandemic recovery, however, can bring emissions close to levels needed to achieve the 2C goal by 2030, the report adds. While the report looks at the plans that governments have submitted to curb their CO2, it also examines the roles of lifestyles and consumption patterns of individuals. It says that the top 10% of earners would need to cut their carbon footprints to around one tenth of their current level to help restrict the rise in temperatures this century to 1.5C You can read more about these findingshere. The airline industry has been scuppered by the pandemic Robin Levinson KingBBC News, Toronto Canada hasofficially approved Pfizer's coronavirus vaccine, which means the first doses could be delivered by the end of the month. The drug will be indicated for people over 16-years-old, while its use in children continues to be studied, the health department said. Earlier this week, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said 249,000 doses could go out to people in long term-care homes as early as the end of December. In total, the Canadian government has purchased 20 million doses of the vaccine - enough to inoculate 10 million people - with the option to buy 56 million more. The country's population is about 37 million. That gives Canada the most doses per capita than anywhere else in the world,according to a recent study.,external Amnesty International has accused Canada,externaland other rich countries of ""hoarding"" the vaccine, and says it could lead to more deaths in the developing world. Maddy SavageBBC News, Stockholm Swedenâs capital has almost reached its limit for providing intensive care beds for the first time during the pandemic, with 99% of all spots filled with serious Covid-19 cases alongside other patients, according to BjÃ¶rn Eriksson, Health and Medical care director for the Stockholm region. He told a news conference that his team had thought they were seeing a âplateau or the beginning of a declineâ of coronavirus admissions, but that the opposite had happened. In a separate interview with major Swedish daily newspaper Dagens Nyheter, he admitted there was a risk that some patients in need of care may not be able to receive it, describing a âvery serious situationâ. Earlier this week intensive care staff from Blekinge in southern Sweden were called in to help doctors at Stockholmâs largest hospital, Karolinska. Sweden, which relied largely on voluntary social distancing guidelines at the start of the pandemic, has recently toughened its restrictions, banning public gatherings of more than eight people and alcohol sales after 10pm. Students over the age of 16 have also switched back to distance-learning, having returned to classrooms in August. However there are ongoing concerns about overcrowding in shops and on public transport. On Tuesday, Health Minister Lena Hallengren promised that everyone aged over 18 would be offered a Covid-19 vaccine within the first six months of 2021. The Pfizer/BioNtech vaccine must be stored at a temperature of -70C We can bring you a response from US Health Secretary Alex Azar to the vaccine advice issued by UK regulators earlier today. UK regulators have advised people with a history of significant allergic reactions against taking the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine. That's because two people had a reaction shortly after having the new jab, though they received treatment and are both fine now (read more about thishere). The vaccine is yet to be approved by the USâs regulatory body, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA),though it has found no safety concerns yet. In an interview with broadcaster CNN,external, Azar was asked if the advice issued in the UK would have any impact on the regulatory authorisation of the vaccine in the US. He said the FDA would examine the data on allergic reactions and speak to UK regulators. âFDA is going to not cut any corners,â Azar said. âTheyâre looking at the data. Theyâre looking under the hood at everything. So Iâm sure thatâll be something the FDA looks at here.â Helier CheungBBC News Hong Kong has had 7,180 coronavirus cases and 114 deaths Hong Kong is struggling under what officials are calling a ""fourth wave"". For several days in the past two weeks, the territory has seen more than 100 new infections per day - a sharp contrast from earlier this year, when the city seemed to have the outbreak contained, and some days with zero local transmissions. Now, authorities have banned dining in restaurants after 6pm - a significant move in a city where many work long hours, and eating out in an essential part of local culture. The government has also orderedcompulsory Covid-19 testing for taxi drivers,externalworking between over Christmas and January, and for residents oftwo housing estate blocks with clusters of infections,external. Mandatory testing is a touchy subject to some in Hong Kong - some activists have raised concerns that testing could be used to collect DNA samples for surveillance purposes - claims the authorities have dismissed as a smear campaign. A survey last month,externalfound 49% of people said they did not trust the government (compared to 30% who said they did). However, attitudes may be changing as infection numbers rise, says Victoria Hui, a Hong Konger and politics professor at Notre Dame University. ""While people didn't want to sign up before, there seems to be more acceptance of testing now... Covid-19 now seems to be the immediate concern, with the possibility of DNA collection becoming a secondary concern,"" she told the BBC. Margaret Keenan left hospital with her daughter Sue The 90-year-old grandmotherwho became the first person in the world to have the Pfizer vaccinehas been discharged from hospital. Margaret Keenan was admitted to University Hospital Coventry a few days before she was given the jab early on Tuesday. Mrs Keenan, who turns 91 next week, said the injection was the ""best early birthday present"". It was the first of 800,000 doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine that will be dispensed in the UK in the coming weeks. Burley is likely to be off screen until the New Year Sky News presenter Kay Burley and three colleagueshave been taken off airwhile an investigation into breaches of Covid guidelines is carried out. Political editor Beth Rigby, north of England correspondent Inzamam Rashid and presenter Sam Washington are off air while the inquiry takes place. BBC media editor Amol Rajan said Burley's job was hanging in the balance. It follows Burley's admission that she ""inadvertently broke the rules"" while celebrating her 60th birthday at the weekend. The journalist said she could ""only apologise"" for her ""error of judgment"". Writing on Twitter on Monday,external, Burley said she had been at a ""Covid compliant"" restaurant on Saturday and had later ""popped into another"" venue to use the toilet. Beth Rigby has also been taken off air Amol Rajan said she was one of a party of 10 people at the Century Club, a private members' club on London's Shaftesbury Avenue. Her group took up two tables, with six people on one and four on the other. Burley then went on to Folie restaurant, where she used the toilet, before moving on to a private residence where individuals from at least three households mixed, Rajan said. London is under tier two restrictions, which means people are not allowed to socialise with anyone from outside their household or support bubble indoors, either in a private home or a public place. The EU regulatory body is assessing whether Covid-19 vaccines are safe for use in European countries The medicines regulator for the European Union (EU) says it has been the victim of a cyber-attack. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) is currently working on approval of two Covid-19 vaccines, which it expects to conclude within weeks. The EMA did not say what the nature of the cyber-attack was, if it was successful, or if it was linked to the vaccine approval process. The agency authorises the use of medicines across the EU. It is trying to decide if the Pfizer/BioNTech jab - which is being rolled out in the UK - and another made by Moderna, are safe for use in EU countries. There has been a string of warnings about hacking threats against vaccine-makers and public health bodies. Security serviceswarned in the summer that Russian intelligencehad been targeting organisations attempting to develop a successful vaccine. Read the full story Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Care home worker Pillay Jagambrun, 61, receiving the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine on Tuesday One of the big unknowns about the vaccines that are being developed is whether they prevent people from passing on the virus. The trials that have taken place have only established that they stop people getting ill. But it is quite possible that someone who is vaccinated could still infect others. The assumption is vaccination will at least disrupt this to some extent - but it may not end transmission completely. For that reason, those who are vaccinated will still be expected to wear masks and self-isolate if they are a close contact of someone who is infected. That does not mean these precautions can never be lifted. Once all the vulnerable people are immunised, there will be a strong case that these steps are not needed â or at least not needed on the scale they are currently being used. However, it will take many months to get to that point. Masks, self-isolation and social distancing are here for a while. Marianna SpringSpecialist disinformation reporter Patricia from Texas is suffering from an unexplained skin condition on her feet - but a misunderstanding about what might have caused it set off a chain of events that turned her into fodder for anti-vaccine activists. Mistaken claims she was injured in a vaccine trial were shared on a fundraiser page. That fuelled rumours and conspiracy theories. They all were based on the idea that Patricia had received the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. She had been part of a trial, but medical records show that instead of the vaccine itself, she received a placebo, a small injection of salt water. Dermatologists confirmed that such an injection would not cause a skin reaction. That didn't stop activists twisting her story to advance their own agendas. The disinformation they fuelled online is worlds apart from legitimate safety concerns and todayâs reports about allergic reactions. On top of the physical pain caused by her condition, Patricia received a wave of online abuse. Read more The Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine has been deemed safe for use by regulators in Canada, paving the way for mass vaccination in the country. Health Canada approved the Covid-19 vaccine on Wednesday, shortly after the UK's move at the start of December. ""The approval of the vaccine is supported by evidence that it is safe, effective and of good quality,"" Health Canada said in a statement. On Monday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Canadians would start receiving their first doses of Pfizer's vaccine before the end of December. A further 533 coronavirus deaths have been recorded in the UK, taking the total number of people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for the virus to 62,566. The latest government figures,externalalso show there have been a further 16,578 cases across the UK. James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News Thestory about two people having allergic reactionsto the Pfizer/BioNTech jab is one to assess with your head and not your gut. No effective medicine is without side effects so you have to balance the risk and the benefit. Remember, one in 1,000 people in the UK have died after being infected with coronavirus this year and that figure is rising daily. Two people, out of thousands vaccinated yesterday, had an allergic reaction which they recovered from. Such reactions can happen with any vaccine and are treated with drugs such as steroids or adrenaline. The trials reportedone possible allergic reaction,externalper 1,000 people immunised that may have been related to the jab. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency has given targeted advice to those most at risk, but for the overwhelming majority of people this changes nothing.

Families pay tributes to workers killed by blast,"The four workers died after an explosion in a biofuel silo The families of three men and a teenage boy who died in last week's explosion near Bristol have paid tribute to them. Luke Wheaton, 16, Ray White, 57, Brian Vickery, 63, and Mike James, 64,died in the incidentat the Wessex Water site on 3 December. Luke's family described him as ""the most gorgeous, loving, happy, talented, perfect son"". Avon and Somerset Police said a cordon at the site was removed on Tuesday evening, but investigations continued. In a statement, Luke's family said: ""Luke knows how much he is loved and will be dearly missed by everyone. ""We just wish we could bring him back."" Witness describes search A 'tragic incident' Mr James' family said he was a brother, husband, father and grandfather who would be missed while Mr White's family described him as a ""wonderful son, brother and father to his two sons"". Mr Vickery's family said he ""brightened everyone's lives with his cheeky and wicked sense of humour"". Luke, of Bradley Stoke, Mr White, of Portishead, Mr Vickery, of Clevedon and Mr James, of Bath, were killed bythe explosion in a biosolids storage silo. Wessex Water's chief executive Colin Skellett said the company had been ""absolutely devastated"" by the deaths More than Â£143,000 has been donated to a crowdfunding page set up by Wessex Water to support the families of the four workers. A separate fundraiser started by Stoke Lane Football Club, where Luke played for the under-18s, has raised more than Â£15,000 towards funeral costs. It is understood Mr James was a contractor working at the site, while Mr Vickery and Mr White were employees of Wessex Water, which owns the plant, and Luke was an apprentice at the firm. Weston College, which Luke attended as part of his course, said it was ""shocked and saddened"" to hear of his death. It said in a statement: ""We have extended our deepest condolences to Luke's family at this incredibly sad time and are providing support to students and staff here at the college.

US Supreme Court rejects bid to overturn Biden win,"Supporters of Donald Trump demonstrated outside the Supreme Court on Tuesday The US Supreme Court has rejected a challenge against President-elect Joe Biden's victory in Pennsylvania. Republicans in the state wanted to overturn certification of the result, but justices rejected the request in a one sentence ruling. It is a blow to President Donald Trump, who has previously suggested without evidence that the election result would be settled in the Supreme Court. Mr Trump lost his bid for re-election last month. Since then he and his supporters have launched dozens of lawsuits questioning the vote results. None have come close to overturning Mr Biden's victory. Where does the Republican Party go after Trump? 'Overvoting' and other US fraud claims fact-checked Can Trump overturn the election result? The Democratic candidate defeated Mr Trump by a margin of 306 to 232 votes in the US electoral college, which chooses the US president. Mr Biden won seven million more votes than the president nationwide. Pennsylvania's Governor Tom Wolf has already certified Mr Biden's victory in the state. Under the rules of the electoral college, the state's 20 electors will meet on 14 December to officially cast their votes for the president-elect. Republicans in the state however wanted to overturn Mr Wolf's certification. The state's top court had rejected their bid last week, which made them appeal to the US Supreme Court in Washington. This video can not be played How are Biden voters in a Trump heartland dealing with the election aftermath? Lawyers for the state and Governor Wolf criticised the case as ""fundamentally frivolous"". ""No court has ever issued an order nullifying a governor's certification of presidential election results,"" they wrote. And on Tuesday the Supreme Court dismissed the suit.The one-sentence ruling,externaldid not even cover the Republicans' allegations, reading simply: ""The application for injunctive relief presented to Justice Alito and by him referred to the Court is denied."" Before, during and after the election, Mr Trump has made unsubstantiated claims of electoral fraud and suggested that the result would eventually be decided in the Supreme Court. The president appointed three of the court's justices during his single term in office. Most recently he controversially placed conservative judge Amy Coney Barrett on the bench after the death of the court's most liberal justice, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, just weeks before the election. This video can not be played Judge Barrett, in her confirmation hearing in October, said she hadn't discussed the elections with President Trump This is not the end of legal challenges to Mr Biden's victory. Republicans in the state of Texas fileda lawsuit in the Supreme Court,externalon Tuesday accusing four other states of election irregularities - a challenge legal experts have sharply criticised. Plaintiffs want the court to stop the use of ""unlawful election results without review and ratification by the defendant states' legislatures"". What legal challenges remain for Trump? 'In his mind, he will not have lost' One law professor at the University of Texas tweeted,externalthat this was ""a new leader in the 'craziest lawsuit filed to purportedly challenge the election' category"", while another law professor at the University of California dismissed it as a ""press release masquerading as a lawsuit"" ina blog post,external. Last weekUS Attorney General William Barr said his justice department had found no proof of mass fraudin the 2020 election.

Students' mental health hit by Covid isolation,"This video can not be played Klaudia moved back home after struggling at university More than 50% of students say their mental health has declined since the Covid pandemic began, says a survey for the National Union of Students (NUS). Many of the 4,241 students surveyed in November say they have suffered stress, loneliness, anxiety and depression. Students have seen most face-to-face teaching and social events cancelled. And the drop-off in interaction with other students appears to hit some students hard, with some finding themselves living completely alone. Despite these difficulties, only a fifth of the students surveyed had sought mental health support. That rose to 29% for those who reported worsening mental health, the survey found. Loneliness and isolation appear to have had a huge impact on wellbeing and mood, with many students socialising and meeting others far less after term began. Shaakir, a second-year journalism student at South Bank University, lives alone in a studio flat in London and is one of those who did not seek support. He has had no face-to-face lessons, and is living in a ""bubble of one"". He often walks the streets just to get out of his room, he says. ""I don't get to socialise with anyone, as my accommodation - and government - rules are that my bubble is myself. ""I'm not allowed to speak to anyone apart from reception, if I'm collecting a parcel. And I'm not allowed to socialise with any of my neighbours."" Shaakir passes the time by walking the streets alone Shaakir describes himself as having ""zero motivation"" - a common symptom of depression. ""On the bad days, usually I'll just stay in bed, stay under the covers, and just sleep as I scroll through my phone, on Twitter or Instagram, whatever it is, and then just go back to sleep."" He adds: ""I think at its worst, it's been like three days of just lights out, blinds down. And just the only time I ever leave bed is to go to the bathroom."" But he feels cheated, as he had been expecting in-person teaching once a week. A South Bank university spokesman said almost all of its courses had face-to-face teaching, and it was made clear at the start of the year if that was not  happening. ""If it hasn't happened in this case we apologise,"" the spokesman added. He said students had been offered comprehensive mental health support, and those who found themselves living alone had been offered the chance to change accommodation. But Shaakir feels his university could have done more to reach out to students like him who are struggling, rather than just sending emails, many of which he could not face opening because of his mental state. The NUS is calling for more investment in student counselling and wellbeing services, as well as individual student unions for the support they offer. Klaudia says her lecturers are supportive Klaudia, a first-year student at Liverpool Hope University who suffers with anxiety, found herself being forced to isolate within a few days of arriving. The philosophy student knew no-one, had no face-to-face teaching scheduled - despite that being promised - and was completely alone in her room for days at a time. She describes how she was not even allowed to move freely in the communal areas of where she was living. ""Every sort of fire door's shut, and everything was cut off ....  the living room - where the shared area was - was completely shut off."" Klaudia says she fell into ""a very depressing state of mind"" in which she felt that everything was ""hopeless"". She reached out to university counselling services, which offered her some sessions, but she found it difficult to engage and open up to ""strangers"". ""It was really hard to discuss the amount of overwhelming things that were happening in my mind at that time,"" she says. But she says she survived with the support of her parents, her boyfriend and the kindness of her lecturers.. Eventually she took the tough decision, following advice from her counsellor, to return home to Newcastle to study. ""It was whether I wanted to fall down a hole by myself, or try and fight through it but lose out on things,"" she says. Klaudia also says the students stuck inside were monitored by security guards, which she found frightening and led to her feeling like ""a criminal in isolation"". ""With the rising [Covid] cases and the thinking that there'll be another lockdown, I didn't want to stay there, you know, through that."" A spokesman for Liverpool Hope University said it took the wellbeing of its students extremely seriously, and worked tirelessly to offer mental health and other support. This includes a team of pastoral advisers who make daily contact with those isolating, mental health and well-being advisers, a laundry service and food deliveries He added: ""Students had access to outside space in a regulated manner according to guidelines. ""Security personnel worked diligently to ensure the safety of both the Hope family and the wider community, in line with government policy."" NUS president Larissa Kennedy said it was no surprise students had experienced deteriorating mental health as a result of the pandemic. ""It is deeply troubling that students are not getting the support that they need, with only 29% of those reporting worse mental health accessing services. ""Students deserve better than their treatment this term. It is time for governments to fund university, college and NHS mental health services to ensure all students can get the support they require. ""Students' unions also need greater investment to continue to provide essential services to students."" A Department for Education (DfE) spokesman said it recognised it had been a very difficult time for students, and protecting their mental health and wellbeing continued to be a top priority. ""We encourage students to contact their university's support and welfare team if they are struggling with their mental health. Many universities have adapted their resources to better support students online and at distance."" The DfE had provided up to Â£3m to fund the mental health platform Student Space, designed to work alongside university and NHS services, he added.

Giuliani given same Covid-19 treatment as Trump,"This video can not be played Mr Giuliani asked a witness to remove her mask at a hearing on alleged election fraud last week President Donald Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, has revealed in a call to his own radio show that he is being treated for coronavirus with the same drug cocktail his boss received when he was ill with Covid-19. He was admitted to hospital on Sunday after becoming the latest official close to Mr Trump to test positive. Mr Giuliani, 76, told the show he expects to leave hospital on Wednesday. He has been treated with Remdesivir and Dexamethasone, he explained. Mr Trump tweeted on Sunday that his ally, who has been leading the Trump campaign's legal challenges to the November election outcome, had beendiagnosed with the virus. ""I am doing fine. Pretty much all the symptoms are gone. The minute I took the cocktail I felt 100% better. It works very quickly, wow,""he told his colleagues on his weekly show with 77 WABC radio,externalfrom the Medstar Georgetown University Hospital in Washington DC. Mr Trump has strongly praised the experimental combination of drugs he received when he spent three nights in hospital with Covid-19 in October. The president's Covid healthcare v the average American's Donald Trump's Covid treatment cocktail explained Where has been hardest hit by the pandemic? Dozens of people in Mr Trump's orbit are said to have tested positive for Covid-19 since October. This video can not be played Four Covid rules broken by Trump and the White House Mr Giuliani said the president's doctor had urged him to go to hospital where he could ""get it [Covid-19] over with in three days"".

During the election campaign earlier this year, Mr Trump's campaign attacked his rival Joe Biden for ""hiding in his basement"" during the pandemic. Dexamethasoneis a tried-and-tested steroid that saves lives by calming the immune system, but it needs to be used at the right time. It is not a drug normally given in a ""mild"" stage of coronavirus Remdesiviris a more experimental drug.

There is no evidence that lives have been saved with this drug Mr Trump also tookmonoclonal antibody therapymade by the company Regeneron. The antibodies physically stick to the coronavirus so they can't get inside the body's cells In 2017 the president owned shares in Gilead, which makes Remdesevir, and Regeneron - but neither company appears on his most recent financial disclosure Mr Giuliani, a former mayor of New York City, had been on a cross-country tour in an effort to convince state governments to overturn the results of the November election vote when he contracted the disease.

'Don't mix with people outside your household',"This video can not be played 'Don't mix' outside your household bubble was the message from Dr Frank Atherton Case rates in more than half of council areas have hit their highest levels yet, according to latest figures from Public Health Wales. Neath Port Talbot - with 693.6 cases per 100,000 in the last week - is the highest in Wales. But 11 other local areas from Ceredigion to Monmouthshire are also at their peak for positive cases. It follows a warning from Wales' chief medical officer not to mix with people outside your household up to Christmas. Dr Frank Atherton told a Welsh Government briefing: ""The best present we can give our families this year is a coronavirus-free Christmas."" Groups of four people from different householdsare allowed to meetindoors at pubs, cafes and restaurants. Previously the Welsh Government has said people should limit themselves to seeing thesame ""one or two friends"". The rule of four also applies when meeting people from different households outdoors, away from your home, but meeting anyone from outside your household bubble in someone's garden is not allowed. Two families can form an extended household and these are the only people allowed to mix inside a home. The case rate for Wales as a whole has also now reached its highest point yet - 351.5 cases per 100,000 people in the last seven days. Neath Port Talbot still has the highest case rate in Wales but it has risen sharply to 693.6 per 100,000. In recent days, according to comparable figures, it has had the worst case rate in the UK. Seven of its communities are in the highest 20 places for localised case rates in Wales, with Aberdulais and Resolven the second highest in Wales on 1,418 cases per 100,000 with 97 positive tests in the past week. The county is also one of four council areas with positivity rates above 20%. The World Health Organisation has recommended the positivity proportion of tests should be no more than 5% before areas come out of restrictions. Public health officials have already warnedCovid rates could soon reach ""catastrophic levels""unless people in the Swansea Bay area followed the rules on social distancing over Christmas. Caerau, near Maesteg, has the highest localised case rate - 1,779.9 per 100,000 - for the past seven days, with 126 cases. The wider Bridgend county has also reached its highest case rate. Newport,with its case rate increasing rapidly and beyond 500, is another which has reached its highest case rate yet, while Cardiff passed 400 cases per 100,000 for the first time. Although comparatively lower, Ceredigion, Carmarthenshire and Monmouthshire are among others witnessing their highest rates since the pandemic began. Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales Q&A: Can I meet friends under new Covid rules? Covid not out of control in Wales, FM insists Beer ban: How are pubs and restaurants coping? Up to 15 people can take part in activities indoors and up to 30 outdoors - providing social distancing, hand hygiene and other Covid safety measures are followed. ""Covid thrives on human contact,"" Dr Atherton said. ""We all have to work to reduce the number of people we have contact with between now and Christmas. ""My message on this is really very simple - don't mix with people outside your household between now and Christmas."" Four people from different households in Wales are currently allowed to meet indoors at pubs, cafes and restaurants and outdoors He said he had cancelled his own plans to visit family in Northern Ireland when it comes out of lockdown and also plans to see his children in England. ""My main priority is to keep my whole family safe and healthy,"" he said. ""The best way I can do that is to stay at home and have a small Christmas this year"". He added that he wouldn't be going out to pubs, restaurants and Christmas fairs in the run up to the holiday. When asked about introducing further restrictions before the festive period, he said ministers were considering ""what further things might be possible in the run up to Christmas"", adding ""that needs to be considered"". ""We also need to think about the Christmas period - managing our risks to make it as low as possible during that five days,"" he said. Dr Atherton told journalists there had been some expectation from the Welsh Government that the public in Wales would limit mixing after the firebreak had ended, but that had ""not happened as anticipated"". He added: ""That's probably understandable given people's enthusiasm to start to think about Christmas, given the tiredness of everybody because of what's happened over the last few months."" On Tuesday, Welsh Government advisers said the number of people in Wales dying with the virus wasabove the worst case scenario. Prior to the firebreak, it was projected under Swansea University's reasonable worse case scenario model that6,000 people could die by March, but a new model has been commissioned which has not yet been published. Mr Atherton said present transmission levels were above what the Welsh Government had expected. ""We are at risk of getting into the Christmas period with much higher rates than we had anticipated or had hoped,"" he said. Q&A: Can I meet friends under new Covid rules?

What you need to know about vaccine safety,"An NHS pharmacy technician at the Royal Free Hospital, London, simulates the preparation of the Pfizer vaccine to support staff training ahead of the rollout In any conversation about vaccine safety, there is one statistic worth holding on to: one in 1,000. One in 1,000 of the entire UK population has already died after being infected with coronavirus during the pandemic. This is the known threat from the disease that any risks have to be balanced against. In medicine there is an important difference between ""safe"" and ""harmless"" and between ""risk"" and something being ""risky"". Andtwo people whowere given the Pfizer vaccine had allergic reactions. So, what do we mean when we talk about Covid vaccines being ""safe"" to use? ""If you mean absolutely no adverse effect, then no vaccine is 'safe' and no drug is 'safe'. Every effective medicine has unwanted effects"" says Prof Stephen Evans, from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine. ""What I mean by safe is the balance of unwanted effects compared with the benefit is very clearly in favour of the benefit."" The UK's medicines regulator, the MHRA, has decided the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine has met that standard. How did they make it so quickly? How worried should we be? There are some drugs that have truly brutal consequences on the body, but are still approved because they are considered worth the risk. Chemotherapy drugs havea huge list of damaging effects,externalinclude exhaustion, hair loss, anaemia, infertility, memory and sleep problems. Yet when those are pitted against dying from terminal cancer, nobody questions the drugs being used. Others can have severe side-effects which are incredibly rare. The painkiller ibuprofen, which nearly all of us have at home and would take without thinking, can causebleeding and holes to form in your stomach,externaland intestines, difficulty breathing and kidney damage. The risks are there, but they are far outweighed by the benefits. ""Safe is not an absolute thing, it is safe in the context of the usage,"" Prof Evans told the BBC. The key difference with vaccines is they are given to healthy people and that massively shifts the balance. Any risk has to be incredibly small. Regulators make the assessment based on far more data than has been made publicly available, much of which has been in the form of press releases. There will be nowhere to hide - if there are safety concerns then the regulators will see them. Companies have to hand over data from laboratory studies, animal studies, the phase one safety trials, the phase two dosing trials and the large phase three ""does it work?"" trials. ""It will amount to at least 10,000 pages of information,"" said Prof Evans. The Pfizer vaccine cuts cases of Covid by about 95%, but it does havevery common side-effects,externalincluding pain from the injection, headache, chills and muscle pain. These could affect more than one in 10 people. These are all symptoms of the immune system kicking into gear and can be managed with paracetamol. ""The MHRA are very experienced, we can be reassured if the regulator says the benefits clearly outweigh the risks, that should be the end of it really,"" says Dr Penny Ward, from King's College London and the Faculty of Pharmaceutical Medicine. It is always possible that vaccines have health consequences that have not yet become clear. There is data on about 20,000 people who were immunised in the Pfizer trial, 15,000 for the Moderna vaccine and 10,000 for the one developed by Oxford/AstraZeneca. That is enough to show the vaccines works and to detect common problems. But they may not pick up something that affects one-in-50,000 people who are immunised. ""You can't always spot them before you license without a trial of millions of people if the side-effect is vanishingly rare,"" says Dr Ward. But this is true for every vaccine that gets approved. It is not a unique or new issue with the Covid jabs. The seasonal flu jab has been linked to about a one-in-a-million chance ofthe nerve disorder Guillain-Barre syndrome,external, although even more cases are caused by the flu virus itself. And about one in 900,000 people havesevere allergic reactions,external, known as anaphylaxis, to a vaccine. ""Not many of us think twice about driving somewhere, but the risk of a car accident is a lot higher than serious effects of a vaccine,"" says Dr Ward. Fake news and conspiracy theories about vaccines are already spreading on social media The danger is people falsely assume health problems that happen by coincidence are caused by the vaccine. It is easy to predict there will be scare stories in the coming months - whether in the press or on social media, have origins that are misguided or plain malicious. But the truth is that people get sick all the time. Every five minutes in the UK one personhas a heart attack,externalandone person has a stroke,external. More than 600,000 people die each year. There will be cases where somebody has a jab one day and then, shortly after, has a serious health problem that would have happened whether they were jabbed or not. ""We could see things that happen by unhappy chance,"" cautions Dr Ward. There is a real threat of repeating mistakes made when the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) jab became falsely linked to autism and led to a drop in children being immunised. It is why you will need to keep your wits about you as the vaccination programme kicks into gear. And it is why safety is monitored long after a vaccine is approved to see if there are any unknown health problems. The MHRA has aYellow Card scheme,externalfor reporting concerns and monitors anonymised data from GP surgeries for any warning signs. FollowJameson Twitter,external TESTING:How do I get a virus test?

Supermarkets will get 'grace period' for NI food,"Supermarkets will be given extra time to phase in new checks, ensuring food supplies from GB to Northern Ireland do not face disruption from 1 January - whether or not there is a Brexit deal. This will allow supermarkets to adapt their systems to deal with new Brexit controls required by the EU. It is part of the agreement reached between the UK and EU on how the new Irish Sea border will operate. The rules will apply whether or not the two sides can agree a trade deal. The so-called ""grace period"" will initially be for three months, with six months guaranteed for chilled meat products. The UK and EU have also agreed, under the part of the original withdrawal deal that deals with Northern Ireland - known as the NI Protocol: A trusted trader scheme, which means all goods going from Great Britain to Northern Ireland will not face any tariffs There will be no European Union embassy in Northern Ireland but Brussels officials will be permitted at border checks in the region once the transition period ends The supply of medicines from GB to Northern Ireland will also avoid disruption, with the industry granted a period of 12 months to adapt to the changes On Wednesday, Downing Street said""very large gaps remain between the two sides""on a trade deal after Prime Minister Boris Johnson met European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in Brussels. The leaders agreed that ""by Sunday a firm decision should be taken about the future of the talks"", a source told the BBC. Ursula von der Leyen confirmed that positions remained ""far apart"", adding that negotiating teams ""should immediately reconvene to try to resolve these essential issues"". ""We will come to a decision by the end of the weekend,"" she said. Outlining details of the agreement reached with the EU on the NI Protocol in parliament on Wednesday, Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove said the government had heard ""loud and clear"" the concerns of supermarket firms and that more flexibility was needed. From 1 January, Northern Ireland will stay in the EU single market for goods, but the rest of the UK will leave. That means a proportion of food products arriving in Northern Ireland from Great Britain will need to be checked. Michael Gove outlined the contents of the agreement in the House of Commons The EU has strict rules on products of animal origin: meat, milk, fish and eggs. These products must enter through a border control post where paperwork is checked and a proportion of goods are physically inspected. Several supermarket chains had warned the supply ofsome products from GB to NI could be reduced, due to extra administrative burdens. On Wednesday,Britain's biggest supermarket Tesco said it was stockpiling food ahead of a potential no-deal Brexit. Mr Gove said the agreement ""also prevents any disruption at the end of the transition period on the movements of chilled meats"". ""British sausages will continue to make their way to Belfast and Ballymena in the new year,"" he added. There is going to be a hard Brexit but the EU and UK are trying to give Northern Ireland a soft landing. The immediate fear about disruption to the flows of supermarket goods across the Irish Sea is addressed with a three-month ""grace period"". But what happens after that? Will there be time to negotiate a more durable arrangement or is this about giving supermarkets time to source more goods on the island of Ireland? And what about those food suppliers which aren't supermarkets? They are anxiously seeking more details. Read more:'Devil in detail' as NI deal gets guarded welcome But Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) Westminster leader, said ""safeguarding the union is not a three-month project"" - but an enduring commitment. He asked Mr Gove to commit, if necessary, to introducing ongoing ""safeguard measures"" to maintain unfettered access between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. The DUPhad opposed the protocol in Parliament, arguing it would create a divide between NI and the rest of the UK that threatened to break up the union. Brexit happened but rules didn't change at once:The UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020, but leaders needed time to negotiate a deal for life afterwards - they got 11 months. Talks are happening:The UK and the EU have until 31 December 2020 to agree a trade deal as well as other things, such as fishing rights. If there is no deal:Border checks and taxes will be introduced for goods travelling between the UK and the EU. But deal or no deal, we will still see changes. What happens next with Brexit? Mr Gove said the government had delivered on its commitment to ensure unfettered access for NI firms shipping goods to the rest of the UK. ""No additional requirements will be placed on NI businesses for these movements, with the very limited and specific exception of trade in endangered species and conflict diamonds,"" he said. Belfast Port will be one of the locations where officials will continue to enforce EU customs codes after 1 January The Northern Ireland Protocol created a category of ""at risk goods"". These are goods which the EU fear could travel from GB through NI into the Republic of Ireland and the wider EU, without paying the correct EU tariff. The protocol makes a provision for tariffs to be charged on these goods. It was feared that a large proportion of goods going from GB-NI could have attracted tariffs in this way. ""Internal UK trade will be protected as we promised - whether we have a free trade agreement or not,"" said Mr Gove. The ""at risk"" goods problem would be almost entirely solved if there was a trade deal between the EU and UK, eliminating tariffs on all goods. But in the absence of a trade deal the trusted trader scheme would minimise the issue. The government also confirmed there will be an EU presence in NI after 1 January, but Mr Gove said it would not amount to a ""Belfast mini-embassy"". ""The EU officials will not have any powers to carry out checks themselves,"" he said, adding there would be ""sensible and practical"" cooperation and data sharing on both sides. Downing Street said it remained committed to peace and prosperity in Northern Ireland and that NI Secretary Brandon Lewis would shortly set out further measures of financial support to help businesses and communities in NI. Its fundamental purpose is to prevent a hardening of the land border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. It does that by keeping Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods and by having Northern Ireland apply EU customs rules at its ports. That means goods arriving from Great Britain are supposed to be checked and controlled at Northern Ireland's ports from 1 January. This arrangement will apply whether or not a wider trade deal is agreed. It will also mean when relevant EU laws are amended or new ones are drawn up, they will apply in Northern Ireland. Under the plan, NI will leave the EU customs union with the rest of the UK at the end of this year, but will continue to enforce the EU's customs code at its ports.

Tesco warns no-deal Brexit will push up food costs,"Brits could turn back to cheddar if the price of French cheese shoots up after a no-deal Brexit. Tesco's chair John Allan told the BBC that import taxes could push up the price of brie by as much as 40%. He said it might ""change the mix of what people eat"", leading to people buying more British cheddar. He added food bills could climb by 5% on average in the event of a no-deal Brexit, with some products increasing even more. He warned consumers could face some disruption to supplies while the industry adjusted to the new situation next year. Earlier, Mr Allen said the grocer had been stockpiling some non-fresh food as it prepares for potential shortages. Last ditch trade talks between the UK and EUended without agreement on Wednesday evening when Prime Minister Boris Johnson met in Brussels with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. Time is running out to reach a deal before 31 December, when the UK stops following EU trading rules. Mr Allen forecast that without a deal food inflation would climb between 3% and 5%, and ""vastly more on some selected items"". Tesco, along with other supermarkets, have reported a jump in sales recently Despite the impact on prices, he said consumers can expect ""pretty much the same choice of products"" on the shelves once Tesco had adjusted to the new set-up. Supermarkets will get 'grace period' for NI food PM: EU demands in Brexit talks 'unacceptable' Could Brexit make your food more expensive? Mr Allan said Tesco was able to stockpile what he called ""longer-life food"", but there could be temporary shortages of ""short-life fresh foods"". He told Bloomberg: ""We are trying to ensure that we have stockpiled as much as we can of long-life products either in our own warehouses or with our suppliers."" Under WTO rules, supermarkets and other importers would have to pay substantial tariffs on many foods they bring in from the EU. Meat and dairy products face particularly high tariffs, but many other areas including fruit and vegetables would be also affected. As an extreme case, the London School of Economics estimates that some speciality cheeses such as halloumi and roquefort could be 55% more expensive. (Tariffs don't just apply to food - cars made in the EU, for instance, would attract a 10% tariff. But food and drinks are the area where the highest tariffs apply.) Government minister George Eustice said prices on average would rise less than 2%, although he admitted some items such as pork and beef would be hit harder. In the short term, shops could absorb those extra costs themselves. But in the longer term they would likely pass some or all of that cost on to customers, in the form of higher prices. Read more here Earlier on Wednesday, the government announced a series of measures to address urgent concerns about the operation of trade between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. With a couple of rare exceptions, all goods going from UK to Northern Ireland will be exempt from EU tariffs. Proposed food safety checks on goods entering NI will be waived for a grace period of three months. Mr Allen said three months was better than nothing and a ""a step in the right direction"". Brexit happened but rules didn't change at once:The UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020, but leaders needed time to negotiate a deal for life afterwards - they got 11 months. Talks are happening:The UK and the EU have until 31 December 2020 to agree a trade deal as well as other things, such as fishing rights. If there is no deal:Border checks and taxes will be introduced for goods travelling between the UK and the EU. But deal or no deal, we will still see changes. What happens next with Brexit? Tesco has also been diverting shipments to ports other than Dover, which he described as ""the throat that gets squeezed"". It comes as ports such as Felixstowe and Southampton face severe delays caused by a surge in imports, leading some to warn that soaring freight costs could be passed on to UK consumers. On Wednesday, trade group Logistics UK blamed the disruption on concerns about a no-deal Brexit, as well as Covid and the Christmas rush. Tesco sorry after online issues amid Christmas rush What happens if there's no trade deal? Mr Allan cautioned against altering UK food regulations after Brexit, telling the BBC that food suppliers had ""no wish to deviate from current food standards"". He spoke out against allowing imports of US chlorine-washed chicken, saying: ""I think most of the food industry is opposed to it."" He added: ""I can't see us being enthusiastic about contributing to anything that would lower food standards in the UK."" Like other supermarkets, Tesco has seen its profits surge in the pandemic as people spend more time at home and splash out on food. Last week, the retailer said it would repay Â£585m in business rates relief after it was criticised for paying dividends to shareholders.

Rich countries 'hoarding Covid vaccines',"Rich countries are hoarding doses of Covid vaccines and people living in poor countries are set to miss out, a coalition of campaigning bodies warns. The People's Vaccine Alliance says nearly 70 lower-income countries will only be able to vaccinate one in 10 people. This is despite Oxford-AstraZeneca pledging to provide 64% of its doses to people in developing nations. Steps are being taken to ensure access to vaccines is fair around the globe. This vaccine commitment, known as Covax, has managed to secure 700 million doses of vaccines to be distributed between the 92 lower-income countries that have signed up. This video can not be played Five challenges of distributing a Covid-19 vaccine around the world. But even with this plan in place,the People's Vaccine Alliance - a network of organisations including Amnesty International, Oxfam and Global Justice Now - says there is not enough to go round,external, and drug companies should share their technology to make sure more doses are produced. Their analysis found that rich countries have bought enough doses to vaccinate their entire populations three times over if all the vaccines are approved for use. Canada, for example, has ordered enough vaccines to protect each Canadian five times, it claims. And even though rich nations represent just 14% of the world's population, they have bought up 53% of the most promising vaccines so far, according to data from eight leading vaccine candidates in Phase 3 trials that have done substantial deals with countries worldwide. Will countries be left behind in the vaccine race? What you need to know about vaccine safety ""No-one should be blocked from getting a life-saving vaccine because of the country they live in or the amount of money in their pocket,"" said Anna Marriott, Oxfam's health policy manager. ""But unless something changes dramatically, billions of people around the world will not receive a safe and effective vaccine for Covid-19 for years to come."" The People's Vaccine Alliance is calling on all pharmaceutical corporations working on Covid-19 vaccines to openly share their technology and intellectual property so that billions more doses can be manufactured and made available to everyone who needs them. This can be done through the World Health Organization Covid-19 technology access pool, it says. This video can not be played 90-year-old woman first to get Pfizer vaccine The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine has already received approval in the UK and the most vulnerable are starting to be vaccinated this week. It is likely to receive approval from regulators in the US and Europe soon. Two other vaccines, from Moderna and Oxford-AstraZeneca, are awaiting regulatory approval in a number of countries. The alliance says that, so far, all of Moderna's doses and 90% of Pfizer/BioNTech's have been acquired by rich countries. AstraZeneca, the company manufacturing the Covid vaccine developed by the University of Oxford, has committed to making it available on a not-for-profit basis to the developing world. It is cheaper than the others and can be stored at fridge temperatures, making it easier to distribute across the globe. While the alliance called this ""a welcome contrast"", it said Oxford/AstraZeneca could ""still only reach 18% of the world's population next year at most"" and ""demonstrates that one company alone cannot hope to supply the whole world"". The Russian vaccine, Sputnik, has also announced positive trial results, and four other vaccines are going through late-stage clinical trials. Meanwhile, shipments of Beijing-based biopharmaceutical companySinovac's Covid-19 vaccine Coronavac have arrived in Indonesiain preparation for a mass vaccination campaign, even though it is yet to finish its late-stage trials.

Loughlin's daughter sorry for college scandal,"Lori Loughlin (right) was jailed for paying to get daughter Olivia Jade into a top university Actress Lori Loughlin's daughter Olivia Jade Giannulli has apologised for her family's actions in the college admissions scandal. Loughlin and her husband Mossimo Giannulli were jailed after paying $500,000 (Â£374,000) to get Olivia Jade and her sister into university. Olivia Jadetold Red Table Talk,externalshe wanted to ""learn from the mistake"". ""I think what was important was for me to come here and say, 'I'm sorry. I acknowledge what was wrong,'"" she said. The 21-year-old gave her first interview to the Facebook Watch show, hosted by actress Jada Pinkett Smith, her mother Adrienne Banfield-Jones and her daughter Willow Smith. Dozens of prominent people including Loughlin, her husband and Desperate Housewives star Felicity Huffman have been prosecuted for their roles in the scandal. More than 30 well-off parents were found to be paying substantial bribes to get their children into elite universities. Loughlin, best known for playing Aunt Becky on sitcom Full House, admitted paying to get places for Olivia Jade and her 22-year-old sister Isabella. Actress Felicity Huffman served 11 days in jail for her part in the admissions scandal Olivia Jade, who is a social media influencer, lost brand deals and left the University of Southern California following the controversy. Loughlin, 56, started a two-month sentence at a California prison in October and is due for release within weeks. Her husband, 57, a fashion designer, began his five-month sentence last month. Olivia Jade said she had been unable to speak to her parents due to quarantine restrictions amid the coronavirus pandemic. She said she did not initially realise her parents were breaking the law because she knew of other children whose parents had done the same thing. ""When all this first happened and it became public I remember thinking, how are people mad about this? It sounds so silly, but in the bubble that I grew up in, a lot of kids' parents were donating to schools,"" she explained. ""It's not fair and it's not right but it was happening."" She added that she now feels embarrassed that she didn't realise at the time she had grown up as part of a privileged bubble. This video can not be played Students react to cheating scam: ""This is how we got into an elite college"" Apologising for her family's part in the scandal, she said: ""I'm not trying to victimise myself. I don't want pity. I don't deserve pity. ""We messed up. I just want a second chance to be like, 'I recognise I messed up.' And for so long I wasn't able to talk about this because of the legalities behind it. ""What's so important to me is to learn from the mistake, not to be shamed and punished and never given a second chance."" Lori Loughlin jailed over college cheating scam TV network drops Loughlin over 'bribes' She added: ""It's been hard. For anybody, no matter what the situation is, you don't want to see your parents go to prison, but also I think it's necessary for us to move on and move forward."" Olivia Jade said she had been working with disadvantaged schoolchildren in Los Angeles since the controversy, adding: ""I understand that I, just based off my skin colour, I already had my foot in the door and I was already ahead of everybody else.

Iran 'makes arrests' over scientist's killing,"Mohsen Fakhrizadeh was head of Iran's Organization of Defensive Innovation and Research Some of the individuals involved in the assassination of Iran's top nuclear scientist have been arrested, an Iranian parliamentary adviser has said. Hossein Amir Abdollahian told Al-Alam TV he was unable to share the details for security reasons, but that the perpetrators would not escape justice. He also said there was evidence proving Israeli involvement. Israel has neither confirmed nor denied responsibility. The scientist, Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, was killed near Tehran on 27 November. How will Iran respond to nuclear scientist's killing? What were the motives behind the killing? After Trump, what will Biden do about Iran? The Iranian authorities have put out conflicting accounts of how he was shot dead as he travelled in a convoy through the town of Absard. On the day of the attack, the defence ministry said there was a gunfight between Fakhrizadeh's bodyguards and several gunmen. An Iranian report also cited witnesses as saying that ""three to four"" assailants had been killed. A remote-controlled machine-gun fired 13 bullets at Mohsen Fakhrizadeh's car, according to Brig-Gen Ali Fadavi But on Sunday, a senior Revolutionary Guards commander saida satellite-controlled machine-gun with ""artificial intelligence"" had fired at Fakhrizadeh's car. Brig-Gen Ali Fadavi told local media that the weapon, mounted in a pick-up truck, was able to ""zoom in"" on the scientist's head and shoot him without hitting his wife beside him. The claim could not be independently verified and was greeted with scepticism by experts in electronic warfare. This video can not be played Mohsen Fakhrizadeh was buried in Tehran following his assassination two weeks ago In an interview with Al-Alam TV, Iran's state-run Arabic-language channel, Mr Abdollahian said: ""Some of the individuals involved in the execution of this assassination have been identified by our security apparatuses and even arrested."" He also said that, in his personal opinion, there were various pieces of evidence ""about those who planned and carried out the assassination that prove the Zionists [Israelis] were involved"". ""But whether the Zionists did so on their own and without the co-operation of, for example, the American [intelligence] service or another service? For sure, they could not have done so on their own,"" he added, without elaborating. The Israeli government has not commented on Iran's assertion that it was behind the assassination, although one unnamed official told Israeli TV two days afterwards that ""Fakhrizadeh's activities had to be stopped"" and that ""the world is a safer place without him"". This video can not be played In 2018, Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu unveiled what he claimed to be Iran's secret atomic archive Israeli and Western security sources say Fakhrizadeh, the head of Iran's Organisation of Defensive Innovation and Research (SPND), was instrumental in the Iranian nuclear programme. They believe the physics professor led ""Project Amad"", a covert programme that Iran allegedly established in 1989 to carry out research on a potential nuclear bomb. The project was shut down in 2003, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency. However, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu said in 2018 that documents obtained by his country showed Fakhrizadeh had led a programme that was secretly continuing Project Amad's work. Iran insists its nuclear programme is entirely peaceful and that it has never sought a nuclear weapon.

Fraud risk warning: 'I was desperate for a job',"Helen Barker says she felt boxed in by the fraudsters At a difficult time in her life, Helen Barker was desperate for a job - and fraudsters tried to take advantage. The 29-year-old, who has since been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, was looking for work in the care sector. She answered a job advert on a big recruitment website. She sent off an application form and other details, only to be told that she had to pay for a DBS check - ensuring she had no criminal convictions - and training. ""They were asking for Â£250 for the training,"" she said. ""It all seemed above board and I thought it must be company policy. ""I felt boxed in and thought I had to do it to get a job."" She had already sent a copy of her passport, but was now being hassled for bank card details to pay. ""They were convincing, but I managed to step out of my desperation for a minute, and knew I should think about it first,"" she said. She talked to people she trusted, realised it was a scam, and managed to avoid losing the money. Since then, she has secured a job managing volunteers, and is warning others that if anyone gets ""pushy"" in that kind of situation, the alarm bells should ring. On top of that, she knows that her mental state at the time made her more vulnerable. Seven ways scammers will exploit coronavirus Fraud: 'I got the shakes every time I went online' People with mental health issues are three times more likely to fall victim to a scam, according to a report by the Money and Mental Health Policy Institute. Its survey and research suggested that 23% of those with mental health problems had been duped by an online scam compared with 8% of the general population. The institute wants more protection written into the forthcomingOnline Harms Bill, with online technology companies required to do more to police and prevent harmful content. Martin Lewis, who founded the institute, said vulnerable people were ""easy prey"" for online criminals, particularly during the pandemic. ""The UK already faced an epidemic of scams, but now lockdown has accelerated it, especially online,"" he said. ""These vicious criminals are exploiting the fact that more people are stuck at home, spending more time online, and potentially struggling with their mental health - all of which increase the risk of falling victim to these schemes."" The fight against scams has also been hit by trading standards officers - the front line against fraudsters - being transferred from their normal duties to other coronavirus-related work, according to the Association of Chief Trading Standards Officers. It said officers had been moved to local authority work ensuring businesses were complying with restrictions, had been seconded as Covid marshals, or had been helping the distribution of food and supplies to people who had been shielding or were vulnerable. ""Rogue traders, scammers and those who sell dangerous products haven't stopped because of Covid-19, but the reality is that many trading standards officers are being pulled away from their usual work tackling criminal activity,"" said Steve Ruddy, who chairs the association. ""It is right that as a country we all pull together to combat this pandemic, but the danger of leaving some of society's most vulnerable people exposed to criminals is something that must be addressed.""

Key to Norman tower returned 50 years on,"St Leonard's Tower is a well-preserved example of a small, free-standing Norman tower keep. A key which opened the doors of an 11th Century tower has been returned almost 50 years after it disappeared. The brass key to St Leonard's Tower in West Malling, Kent, was sent along with an anonymous note to English Heritage. The mystery sender, who said they ""borrowed"" the key in 1973 wrote: ""Sorry for the delay."" English Heritage properties curator Samantha Stone said the sender was not in trouble and hoped they would get back in touch to give more information. ""Sorry for the delay"", wrote the sender, after having the key for almost 50 years The key - thought to have been made at some point in the 19th Century - still fits in the keyhole of the doors to the Norman tower keep, although it no longer rotates. Very little is known about the history of the building or its original purpose. Some believe the tower was once part of a castle, built by Gundulf, Bishop of Rochester, while others say the builder was Bishop Odo of Bayeux, the half-brother of William the Conqueror. The key fits in the lock, but no longer works as the locks were changed Speaking to BBC's Today programme, Ms Stone said: ""There is no evidence of latrines or fireplaces, or anything that would suggest a domestic purpose, so its purpose has always been slightly mysterious. ""We assume it was for the administration of the bishop's manor. ""So the mystery of the key is very fitting in the wider history of the tower."" She said the sender had ""kept it safe all this time, which shows some care and dedication"" and English Heritage was ""very grateful"" and intrigued by the unusual story. She urged the sender to get back in touch, saying she would like to offer them English Heritage membership.

PM to go to Brussels in Brexit breakthrough bid,"Phone calls between Mr Johnson and Ursula von der Leyen have so far failed to find a way through Boris Johnson will fly to Brussels later for talks on a post-Brexit deal with the European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. Time is running out to reach a deal before 31 December, when the UK stops following EU trading rules. The pair will hold talks over dinner, after negotiations between officials ended in deadlock. Major disagreements remain on fishing rights, business competition rules and how a deal will be policed. At the dinner, expected to begin at 19:00 GMT, the prime minister will work through a list of the major sticking points with Mrs von der Leyen, who is representing the leaders of the 27 EU nations. A UK government source said progress at a political level may allow the negotiations - between the UK's Lord Frost and EU's Michel Barnier - to resume over the coming days. But the source added that it was important to be ""realistic"" that an agreement might not be possible. Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Johnson said ""a good deal is still there to be done"", but stressed that the EU's position was to have an ""automatic right to punish us"" if the UK's rules and regulations didn't move in step with the EU in the future. Meanwhile German Chancellor Angela Merkel has said a Brexit deal was still possible but insisted that the integrity of the EU single market must be respected. Kuenssberg analysis: Will Brexit dinner prove to be the last supper? What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? What happens if there's no trade deal? EU sources told the BBC that Mr Barnier briefed the bloc's Europe ministers that talks were tilting towards no deal being reached before the deadline. This video can not be played A deal with the EU can't come ""at any price,"" says Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg says that the purpose of the dinner is not to call a halt or to proclaim that a deal's been done. ""The reason for the meeting is to see if both sides are willing in principle to tolerate the notion of budging, after the negotiations, and frankly negotiators, have been exhausted,"" she says. EU leaders are due to meet for a summit of their own on Thursday. It comes as no surprise at all that EU-UK talks have gone down to the wire. That was widely predicted. As was the ""both making last-minute political compromises"" part, believed to come right at the end, after the two sides abandon their high-stakes game of chicken. But tonight's dinner is far more complex than the prime minister declaring ""OK, Ursula, we'll give you your level playing field, if you (EU) give us our fish."" The clash of ideologies, clear from the start, is still very much present. We have the government's determination to protect its post-Brexit sovereignty, and not sign up to another Brussels rule book on the one side and on the other, the EU focus on protecting its single market a) from what it views as potentially unfair competition from the UK and b) in terms of global reputation. Brussels believes compromising single market rules for a UK deal, would weaken it in the eyes of other future trade partners. Conclusion: As much as Boris Johnson and Ursula von der Leyen, say they still hope for a deal, 'no deal' is still very much on the table tonight, alongside dinner. In separate talks on Tuesday, the UK and EUreached an agreementon specific trade arrangements for Northern Ireland - including on post-Brexit border checks and trading rules for NI, and how the new Irish Sea border will work. It means the UK has now dropped plans to override sections of its EU exit agreement signed last year, which would have potentially broken international law. UK to drop US goods tariffs in bid for trade deal UK and EU reach deal over NI border checks Details of the NI agreement have not yet been published, but Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove is making a statement in the Commons on Wednesday. The agreement was an important moment for businesses, said BBC Northern Ireland political reporter Jayne McCormack. ""But some firms and political parties may be less receptive when they see the finer details of what's been decided,"" she said. Brexit happened but rules didn't change at once:The UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020, but leaders needed time to negotiate a deal for life afterwards - they got 11 months. Talks are happening:The UK and the EU have until 31 December 2020 to agree a trade deal as well as other things, such as fishing rights. If there is no deal:Border checks and taxes will be introduced for goods travelling between the UK and the EU. But deal or no deal, we will still see changes. What happens next with Brexit? Speaking to the BBC, Mr Gove confirmed that EU officials would be present in Northern Ireland ""to make sure the processes, that we are in control of, will be running appropriately"". Former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith said there would be a need ""for some explanation"" from the government because MPs had been ""assured by the government that there were would be no customs officials sitting around"". The UK and EU are at loggerheads over the so-called ""level playing field"" - a set of shared rules and standards to ensure businesses in one country do not have an unfair advantage over their competitors in others. Brussels wants the UK to follow EU rules closely in areas such as workers' rights and environmental regulations, but the UK says the goal of Brexit is to break free from following common rules and reassert national sovereignty. And the two sides disagree on how any future trading disputes should be resolved. On fishing, the two sides continue to haggle over how much access European fishing boats should have to British waters, and how much they would be allowed to catch from next year.

What you need to know about vaccine safetyAnd how to immunise yourself against the spread of fake news about what medicines work.HealthComments,"An NHS pharmacy technician at the Royal Free Hospital, London, simulates the preparation of the Pfizer vaccine to support staff training ahead of the rollout In any conversation about vaccine safety, there is one statistic worth holding on to: one in 1,000. One in 1,000 of the entire UK population has already died after being infected with coronavirus during the pandemic. This is the known threat from the disease that any risks have to be balanced against. In medicine there is an important difference between ""safe"" and ""harmless"" and between ""risk"" and something being ""risky"". Andtwo people whowere given the Pfizer vaccine had allergic reactions. So, what do we mean when we talk about Covid vaccines being ""safe"" to use? ""If you mean absolutely no adverse effect, then no vaccine is 'safe' and no drug is 'safe'. Every effective medicine has unwanted effects"" says Prof Stephen Evans, from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine. ""What I mean by safe is the balance of unwanted effects compared with the benefit is very clearly in favour of the benefit."" The UK's medicines regulator, the MHRA, has decided the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine has met that standard. How did they make it so quickly? How worried should we be? There are some drugs that have truly brutal consequences on the body, but are still approved because they are considered worth the risk. Chemotherapy drugs havea huge list of damaging effects,externalinclude exhaustion, hair loss, anaemia, infertility, memory and sleep problems. Yet when those are pitted against dying from terminal cancer, nobody questions the drugs being used. Others can have severe side-effects which are incredibly rare. The painkiller ibuprofen, which nearly all of us have at home and would take without thinking, can causebleeding and holes to form in your stomach,externaland intestines, difficulty breathing and kidney damage. The risks are there, but they are far outweighed by the benefits. ""Safe is not an absolute thing, it is safe in the context of the usage,"" Prof Evans told the BBC. The key difference with vaccines is they are given to healthy people and that massively shifts the balance. Any risk has to be incredibly small. Regulators make the assessment based on far more data than has been made publicly available, much of which has been in the form of press releases. There will be nowhere to hide - if there are safety concerns then the regulators will see them. Companies have to hand over data from laboratory studies, animal studies, the phase one safety trials, the phase two dosing trials and the large phase three ""does it work?"" trials. ""It will amount to at least 10,000 pages of information,"" said Prof Evans. The Pfizer vaccine cuts cases of Covid by about 95%, but it does havevery common side-effects,externalincluding pain from the injection, headache, chills and muscle pain. These could affect more than one in 10 people. These are all symptoms of the immune system kicking into gear and can be managed with paracetamol. ""The MHRA are very experienced, we can be reassured if the regulator says the benefits clearly outweigh the risks, that should be the end of it really,"" says Dr Penny Ward, from King's College London and the Faculty of Pharmaceutical Medicine. It is always possible that vaccines have health consequences that have not yet become clear. There is data on about 20,000 people who were immunised in the Pfizer trial, 15,000 for the Moderna vaccine and 10,000 for the one developed by Oxford/AstraZeneca. That is enough to show the vaccines works and to detect common problems. But they may not pick up something that affects one-in-50,000 people who are immunised. ""You can't always spot them before you license without a trial of millions of people if the side-effect is vanishingly rare,"" says Dr Ward. But this is true for every vaccine that gets approved. It is not a unique or new issue with the Covid jabs. The seasonal flu jab has been linked to about a one-in-a-million chance ofthe nerve disorder Guillain-Barre syndrome,external, although even more cases are caused by the flu virus itself. And about one in 900,000 people havesevere allergic reactions,external, known as anaphylaxis, to a vaccine. ""Not many of us think twice about driving somewhere, but the risk of a car accident is a lot higher than serious effects of a vaccine,"" says Dr Ward. Fake news and conspiracy theories about vaccines are already spreading on social media The danger is people falsely assume health problems that happen by coincidence are caused by the vaccine. It is easy to predict there will be scare stories in the coming months - whether in the press or on social media, have origins that are misguided or plain malicious. But the truth is that people get sick all the time. Every five minutes in the UK one personhas a heart attack,externalandone person has a stroke,external. More than 600,000 people die each year. There will be cases where somebody has a jab one day and then, shortly after, has a serious health problem that would have happened whether they were jabbed or not. ""We could see things that happen by unhappy chance,"" cautions Dr Ward. There is a real threat of repeating mistakes made when the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) jab became falsely linked to autism and led to a drop in children being immunised. It is why you will need to keep your wits about you as the vaccination programme kicks into gear. And it is why safety is monitored long after a vaccine is approved to see if there are any unknown health problems. The MHRA has aYellow Card scheme,externalfor reporting concerns and monitors anonymised data from GP surgeries for any warning signs. FollowJameson Twitter,external TESTING:How do I get a virus test?

Tesco stockpiles food in case of no-deal Brexit,"Brits could turn back to cheddar if the price of French cheese shoots up after a no-deal Brexit. Tesco's chair John Allan told the BBC that import taxes could push up the price of brie by as much as 40%. He said it might ""change the mix of what people eat"", leading to people buying more British cheddar. He added food bills could climb by 5% on average in the event of a no-deal Brexit, with some products increasing even more. He warned consumers could face some disruption to supplies while the industry adjusted to the new situation next year. Earlier, Mr Allen said the grocer had been stockpiling some non-fresh food as it prepares for potential shortages. Last ditch trade talks between the UK and EUended without agreement on Wednesday evening when Prime Minister Boris Johnson met in Brussels with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. Time is running out to reach a deal before 31 December, when the UK stops following EU trading rules. Mr Allen forecast that without a deal food inflation would climb between 3% and 5%, and ""vastly more on some selected items"". Tesco, along with other supermarkets, have reported a jump in sales recently Despite the impact on prices, he said consumers can expect ""pretty much the same choice of products"" on the shelves once Tesco had adjusted to the new set-up. Supermarkets will get 'grace period' for NI food PM: EU demands in Brexit talks 'unacceptable' Could Brexit make your food more expensive? Mr Allan said Tesco was able to stockpile what he called ""longer-life food"", but there could be temporary shortages of ""short-life fresh foods"". He told Bloomberg: ""We are trying to ensure that we have stockpiled as much as we can of long-life products either in our own warehouses or with our suppliers."" Under WTO rules, supermarkets and other importers would have to pay substantial tariffs on many foods they bring in from the EU. Meat and dairy products face particularly high tariffs, but many other areas including fruit and vegetables would be also affected. As an extreme case, the London School of Economics estimates that some speciality cheeses such as halloumi and roquefort could be 55% more expensive. (Tariffs don't just apply to food - cars made in the EU, for instance, would attract a 10% tariff. But food and drinks are the area where the highest tariffs apply.) Government minister George Eustice said prices on average would rise less than 2%, although he admitted some items such as pork and beef would be hit harder. In the short term, shops could absorb those extra costs themselves. But in the longer term they would likely pass some or all of that cost on to customers, in the form of higher prices. Read more here Earlier on Wednesday, the government announced a series of measures to address urgent concerns about the operation of trade between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. With a couple of rare exceptions, all goods going from UK to Northern Ireland will be exempt from EU tariffs. Proposed food safety checks on goods entering NI will be waived for a grace period of three months. Mr Allen said three months was better than nothing and a ""a step in the right direction"". Brexit happened but rules didn't change at once:The UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020, but leaders needed time to negotiate a deal for life afterwards - they got 11 months. Talks are happening:The UK and the EU have until 31 December 2020 to agree a trade deal as well as other things, such as fishing rights. If there is no deal:Border checks and taxes will be introduced for goods travelling between the UK and the EU. But deal or no deal, we will still see changes. What happens next with Brexit? Tesco has also been diverting shipments to ports other than Dover, which he described as ""the throat that gets squeezed"". It comes as ports such as Felixstowe and Southampton face severe delays caused by a surge in imports, leading some to warn that soaring freight costs could be passed on to UK consumers. On Wednesday, trade group Logistics UK blamed the disruption on concerns about a no-deal Brexit, as well as Covid and the Christmas rush. Tesco sorry after online issues amid Christmas rush What happens if there's no trade deal? Mr Allan cautioned against altering UK food regulations after Brexit, telling the BBC that food suppliers had ""no wish to deviate from current food standards"". He spoke out against allowing imports of US chlorine-washed chicken, saying: ""I think most of the food industry is opposed to it."" He added: ""I can't see us being enthusiastic about contributing to anything that would lower food standards in the UK.""

"'Price rises likely' due to UK shipping problemsBusinesses say importing goods to the UK is now so difficult, higher costs will be passed on to consumers.BusinessComments","A container ship docked at Felixstowe port last month Businesses say a global shipping crisis is causing freight costs to soar and UK consumers may soon see price rises for imported goods. On top of skyrocketing shipping rates, carriers are adding congestion charges for imports to Felixstowe and Southampton, because of severe delays. The logistics industry has written to the Department for Transport calling for it to help clear port backlogs. One freight director said the UK's ports are currently ""broken"". Global shipping schedules were initially disrupted during the early stages of the pandemic, but recently a surge in demand for imports and a backlog of empty shipping containers are causing bottlenecks at UK ports. This week, two major cargo shipping companies, Maersk and MSC, said they were swapping Felixstowe port for Liverpool in order to ""provide stability"" to their transatlantic trade services. Alex Veitch, boss of trade group Logistics UK, blamed the disruption on ""the three C's"". ""It's the Christmas rush, coronavirus, which is still causing supply chain disruption, and now customs - or the uncertainty around it, with businesses taking the decision to move goods in and out of the UK in case there is a no-deal Brexit,"" he told the BBC. Home appliance importer Adam Russell says it's ""near impossible"" to ship goods out of China Adam Russell, who imports home appliances such as heaters and air conditioners for One Retail Group based in London, said the situation is ""scary"". ""We used to pay $2,000 to ship a 40-ft container to the UK, now we're paying at least $8,000 up to $10,000. ""Ultimately that means we're going to have to stop importing or we're going to have to pass that on to the consumer."" He said it's ""near impossible"" to get goods out of China now because fewer vessels than normal are sailing to the UK and there's also a shortage of empty containers ready to be filled in Chinese ports. He's not the only one facing disruption: Major shipping companies including Marseille-based CMA-CGM have told UK importers no more bookings can be made for ships sailing from Asia until the last week of December. TheJapanese carmaker Honda said delays at UK portsare holding up imports of parts and production will temporarily cease at its Swindon plant from Wednesday. The Builders Merchants Federation has also complained of delays for building supplies such as screws and timber, crucial for building new homes. Organisations representing the UK's ports, shipping and logistics sectors have written to Transport Secretary Grant Shapps, urging the government to do what it can to improve the situation. ""We recognise government's capacity to step in is limited, but where they can, they should look at ways of increasing the capacity for moving containers on and off ports,"" said Tim Morris, chief executive of the UK Major Ports Group. ""That could mean running more and longer trains to and from ports, allowing hauliers more flexibility to collect containers out of normal hours, and for drivers to take on longer shifts where that can be done safely."" The UK Chamber of Shipping said the shipping industry was not in crisis but acknowledged the backlogs, adding: ""We are confident the resilience within the supply chain can cope with this disruption."" The letter to the Transport Secretary also warns of further potential disruption when the Brexit transition period ends on 31 December. The Department for Transport said partners across government are working closely with the freight industry to resolve the challenges. Logistics firms that are responsible for transporting goods from ports to warehouses say the situation is creating huge amounts of stress. ""We've had one staff member leave because she can't take the customer complaints,"" said Ryan Clark, director of the Essex-based freight forwarder Westbound Logistics Services. Mr Clark said that as shipping orders into the UK have surged, the unloading time for vessels has increased. That means there are fewer berthing slots available at ports and congestion problems are getting worse. Problems that have been plaguing Felixstowe for weeks have now spread to Southampton and the system is ""broken"", he said. ""The increase in freight is either creating more expensive prices for the consumer, or unsustainability for businesses that will be forced to close where the onward price cannot be increased."" Honda warns of parts shortage due to UK port woes Felixstowe port in 'chaos' as Christmas and Brexit loom Port troubles leave UK bookseller with no books A spokesperson for DP World in the UK, which operates Southampton port, said: ""We are currently dealing with higher than usual yard volumes and also bad weather, including fog, leading to our truck turnaround times being longer. ""We expect levels to return to normal over the next week."" Paving importer Ben Charlton said shipping services have become ""shockingly unreliable"" But Ben Charlton, a business manager for paving importer Hanson Stone, based in Mansfield, said logistics firms are telling him it will be two to three months before the situation returns to normal. He said he's been waiting since the start of the month for containers to be unloaded at Felixstowe. ""We're a start-up company, we've only been running a year, we've had Covid to contend with, and now we've got this,"" he said. He says he is paying about Â£1,200 more per container in increased shipping costs which adds up. The company also operates on a credit system, where suppliers in India are paid 30-60 days after the stock arrives in the UK but the delays at Felixstowe are making cash flow a problem. ""Ultimately it's [all] going to get passed on to the end consumer and landscaping companies who buy from us down the line,"" he said. Eleanor Hadland, a ports analyst at the maritime consultancy Drewry, said ""the whole global container supply chain is basically out of balance"". The system stopped working properly when economies in various parts of the world shut down and re-opened at different times, as they dealt with Covid-19, she said. She warned the end result could resemble the credit crunch of 2008 when importers' lines of credit dried up. ""If the time it takes to receive goods at your shop is lengthening, you're having to find the cash to pay your suppliers sooner,"" she said, and that could have huge ramifications for global trade. ""What we're seeing is a trend away from globalised supply chains and people looking to buy goods regionally,"" she said.

LiveLivePMQs: Boris Johnson faces MPs' questionsLess than a minute ago,"Boris Johnson and Labour leader Keir Starmer clashed at PMQs on the status of ongoing Brexit talks Mr Johnson said ""a good deal is still there to be done"", but said the EU's position was to have an ""automatic right to punish us"" Cabinet minister Michael Gove outlined details of a Brexit deal for EU goods that reach the UK via the new Irish Sea border Supermarkets will be given a ""grace period"" to ensure food supplies from GB to NI do not face disruption from 1 January Boris Johnson and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen will meet in Brussels this evening for talks on a post-Brexit deal Time is running out to reach a deal before 31 December, when the UK stops following EU trading rules. UK medicines regulator has advices people with a history of significant allergic reactions should not have the new Covid jab Kate Whannel, Katie Wright and Richard Morris BBC Politics That's all from us for now. We'll pop up again later this evening to take you through any developments from the PM's dinner in Brussels with EU chief Ursula von der Leyen, which is due to start around 19:00 GMT. We don't know what the outcome of their talks will be tonight, but we do know they have the same 'menu' in front of them as they did when the spoke on the telephone earlier this week. And so far they've found their differences over a Brexit deal hard to digest. (Ok, we'll stop with the terrible food puns now). And as our political editorLaura Kuenssberg explains hereit is certainly ""more than a standard diplomatic dinner"". Boris Johnson and Ursula von der Leyen outside No 10 in January Our team with you this afternoon were Kate Whannel, Katie Wright and Richard Morris, with Johanna Howitt in the editor's chair. Thanks for following along with us. We hope you'll come back to join us later. Reality Check The post-Brexit trade talks between the UK and the EU are going down to the wire, and need to make progress in the next few days if a deal is to emerge before the end of the year. But the negotiators appear to have hit a brick wall on some fundamental issues.  Our Reality Check team look at the issues in detailhere Chris MorrisBBC Reality Check The prime minister has repeatedly talked about leaving the
European Union with an Australia-style deal â if he canât reach a trade deal
with the EU -  and he did so again at Prime Ministerâs Questions today. What an âAustralia-styleâ arrangement means is no deal with
the EU on free trade, no agreement on removing tariffs (or taxes) on goods
crossing borders, and having to rely on the basic rules of the World Trade
Organisation (WTO). Other countries â including the United States â trade with
the EU on WTO terms, but they also have a variety of separate agreements easing
trade in various sectors of the economy (as does Australia). The UK would not have any such agreements if talks with the
EU break down. Australia itself has been negotiating a free trade deal with
the EU since 2018, but it does far less trade with the EU than the UK does. You can read more about this here. This video can not be played PMQs: Johnson and Leigh on UK-EU post Brexit trade talks As we wrap up our coverage of events in the Commons this afternoon, all eyes in Westminster will now begin to move their gaze to the talks this evening in Brussels. Boris Johnson will have dinner tonight with EU Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen.  The dinner is expected to begin at 19:00 GMT. The PM and Mrs Von der Leyen will work through a list of the major sticking points in the Brexit talks. At PMQs earlier, Mr Johnson told MPs ""a good deal is still there to be done"".  But he suggested the EU could not accept the UK having sovereign control over its fishing waters after Brexit.. Time is running out to reach a deal before 31 December, when the UK stops following EU trading rules. Read more on tonight's talks here. Conservative Simon Hoare - who chairs the Common's Northern Ireland Committee - closes the session with the final question to Mr Gove. He congratulates him for protecting theGood Friday Agreementand upholding the rule of law. He asks for assurances that during the grace period, businesses will be supported and helped through the new customs regime. Michael Gove says concluding this agreement ""is just one step"" and the government needs to continue supporting businesses in Northern Ireland, ""large and small"" through the months ahead.  Port of Belfast On Tuesday, the UK and EU reached an agreement on how the new Irish Sea border will operate after the UK leaves the current border arrangements on 31 December. Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove has been outlining further details of the agreement reached with the EU on how the Northern Ireland part of the Brexit withdrawal deal - known as the Protocol - will work. Mr Gove told MPs supermarkets will be given a ""grace period"" to ensure food supplies from GB to NI do not face disruption. Read more here.  Japanese carmaker Honda has warned thatproduction at its Swindon plant will be disrupted, after transport problems caused a shortage of parts. Labour's Matt Western raises the paused production with Mr Gove, asking if this is the fault of the government or Honda. Mr Gove replies to say there is a ""global problem in container traffic"" which has been well-documented. Labour's Chi Onwurah asks what deal businesses should be preparing for, because there is no clarity. She adds that small businesses are being affected by the pandemic already are now facing Brexit uncertainty. Much of what most small businesses need to do is ""broadly the same"" says Michael Gove. The fate and future of businesses in the North East are ""very dear to me"". He adds that these areas in the North East are now voting Conservative because ""we stand up for workers"". Conservative MP Marco Longhi seeks assurance that if there is a trade agreement ""the government will not compromise on fishing, borders and laws"". Michael Gove replies that he is ""bang on"". Another Conservative, Miriam Cates, wants to know that the government will keep in place the rest of the Internal Market Bill. She says it is important to ensure goods can flow across all four nations Michael Gove says the bill is a ""critical law"" which safeguards the rights of consumers and businesses. He says he hopes the bill will passnow the controversial clauses have been removed. ""Northern Ireland Protocol"", ""unfettered access"", ""withdrawal agreement"". The Commons statement has been pretty jargon-heavy. If you are reading some of these terms for the first time - or just want to brush up on your Brexit chat -our jargon-busting guide might help. The DUP leader in Westminster Sir Jeffrey Donaldson says the Act of Union states there should be no barrier to trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. He also says the Northern Ireland Protocol allows the UK government to take unilateral action if the Protocol leads to economic or environmental difficulties. He asks the government if it will take safeguarding measures to secure unfettered access in both directions for trade between GB and NI. Michael Gove replies that he hopes future issues can be resolved ""through patience and pragmatic discussion"". Liberal Democrat Christine Jardine asks if this agreement might end up being used to undermine Scotland's position within the UK union. Mr Gove says that Northern Ireland ""is in a unique position within the UK"" and that ""the vast majority of people in the UK recognise that"". He says it is important that the government recognises that there are unique things Scotland contributes to the UK economy. Plaid Cymru MP Hywel Williams says that what Northern Ireland has what Wales wants, ""unfettered access"" to the UK as well as the EU. He asks what steps have been taken by the government to avoid disruption. Mr Gove replies that the government has been working well with the Welsh government, to ensure that the busiest port in the UK, Holyhead, can ""continue to prosper"". Labour MP and Brexit committee chair Hilary Benn worries that the deal reached is ""not a permanent arrangement but a series of grace periods"". He notes that food will be exempt from export health certificates for a period of three months while chilled meat will be allowed ""for a period of time after which they might be prevented from moving from GB to NI"". ""What is going to happen after those dates?"", he asks Michael Gove says the government has been working with supermarkets to ensure they are ready and some requested a grace period. ""Those in the European Commission said it would not be possible... but we managed to secure three months which he says ""is sufficient time to ensure supermarkets are ready"". He adds that the deal will ""ensure we provide people in NI with access to the food we currently enjoy without any disruption to the supply chain of supermarkets"". Jayne McCormackBBC News NI political reporter Supermarkets will be given a ""grace
period"" to ensure food supplies from GB to NI do not face disruption from
1 January. This will give supermarkets time to adapt
their systems to deal with new Brexit checks required by the EU. It is part of the agreement reached
between the UK and EU on how the new Irish Sea border will operate. The rules will apply regardless of whether
the two sides can agree a trade deal. Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove is
outlining further details of the agreement reached with the EU on how the NI
part of the original withdrawal deal, known as the Protocol, will work. He said the government had heard âloud and
clearâ the concerns of supermarket firms, and that ânecessary additional
flexibilitiesâ would be made. From 1 January, Northern Ireland will stay
in the EU single market for goods but the rest of the UK will leave. That means a proportion of food products
arriving in Northern Ireland from Great Britain will need to be checked. The EU has strict rules on products of
animal origin: meat, milk, fish and eggs. These products must enter through a border
control post where paperwork is checked and a proportion of goods are
physically inspected. Several supermarket chains had warnedthe supply of some products from GB to NI could be reduced, due to extra administrative burdens. The supply of medicines from GB to NI will
also avoid disruption, Mr Gove said the government had delivered
on its commitment to ensure unfettered access for NI firms shipping goods to
the rest of the UK. âNo additional requirements will be placed
on NI businesses for these movements, with the very limited and specific
exception of trade in endangered species and conflict diamonds,â he said. Replying to Rachel Reeves Michael Gove says there will be ""border facilities"" to ensure ""limited and proportionate"" sanitary checks can be carried out. He says the government has spent Â£200m to support NI businesses. And he emphasises that ""no additional customs checks which will be facing goods going from Northern Ireland to great Britain"". On the issue of regulations, Mr Gove says the UK has ""a proud tradition of upholding workers' rights"". ""That will not change,"" he says adding: ""One thing we can't accept is the demand from some in the EU that if the EU adopts new laws we should automatically follow those laws.""  Labour's shadow minister Rachel Reeves says Labour ""welcomes the statement"" and is glad that there have been agreements reached on Northern Ireland. She says game-playing, with threats to break international law ""is dangerous"" and can lead to ""destruction"". Manufacturing NI has warned that just 9% of businesses are ready for Brexit, she adds. She asks why the documents show that trade from Great Britain to Northern Ireland will face checks, and there is only a grace period for three and a half years. She asks if additional customs checks will be required from April 2021, as alluded to in the documents. She says this is a ""disgraceful way to treat businesses"", especially during a pandemic. There are some in the Conservative Party who view any agreement with the EU as a ""betrayal,"" she says, but losing jobs and businesses is a ""betrayal to the British people"". She asks once again how many customs agents will be ready on January 1st, and how ready border facilities are. Michael Gove continues that firms in Great Britain will stay outside state aid rules ""where there is no impact on NI-EU trade"". He also says the deal ensures Northern Ireland will be out of the Common Agricultural Policy ""so Northern Ireland has freedom to set own agricultural subsidies"". And he says Northern Ireland service industries will be outside the scope ofthe Northern Ireland protocol. Mr Gove insists that there will be no ""mini EU embassy in Belfast"" and that EU officials will not be able to carry out checks themselves. However he says there will be data sharing between the UK and the EU. The Northern Ireland protocol can be implemented in a ""pragmatic"" way, he says, and adds that the people of Northern Ireland will be able to decide if the arrangements continue in the future. Following Brexit, Northern Ireland's 310-mile border with the Republic of Ireland is the only land border between the UK and the European Union (EU). Under an arrangement known as the Northern Ireland protocol, goods will not need to be checked along the Irish border when the new UK-EU relationship begins on 1 January. Read our explanation of the Protocol hereand why avoiding border checks so important  Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove starts by saying the UK government has worked this year to ensure that the Northern Ireland Protocol can be agreed with the EU. The protocol was a section of the Brexit withdrawal deal to protect trade across the border in Northern Ireland and the UK mainland. It said that goods will not need to be checked along the Irish border when the new UK-EU relationship begins on 1 January. Mr Gove starts by explaining that the Protocol set out objectives on trading. Mr Gove says yesterday the UK reached a deal in principle which allows the UK to reach those commitments, and which puts the people on Northern Ireland first. He says there will be no additional checks between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, unless it is rare and endangered species of animals. Northern Ireland businesses selling to consumers or trading between businesses will face no tariffs, he adds. This will happen whether there is a deal or not. There are additional flexibilities to protect supermarkets. There will be a grace period for supermarkets to implement new rules and trades. He says this is three commitments the UK government has held. We'll turn now from PMQs to a statement from the Cabinet office minister Michael Gove. Yesterday Mr Gove brokered a deal with EU commissioner MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ onhow rules in the Brexit divorce deal will be implemented, particularly in relation to Northern Ireland.

Most GB-NI goods 'will not face tariffs' with planA trusted trader scheme will form part of plans for how the new Irish Sea border will operate.,"Supermarkets will be given extra time to phase in new checks, ensuring food supplies from GB to Northern Ireland do not face disruption from 1 January - whether or not there is a Brexit deal. This will allow supermarkets to adapt their systems to deal with new Brexit controls required by the EU. It is part of the agreement reached between the UK and EU on how the new Irish Sea border will operate. The rules will apply whether or not the two sides can agree a trade deal. The so-called ""grace period"" will initially be for three months, with six months guaranteed for chilled meat products. The UK and EU have also agreed, under the part of the original withdrawal deal that deals with Northern Ireland - known as the NI Protocol: A trusted trader scheme, which means all goods going from Great Britain to Northern Ireland will not face any tariffs There will be no European Union embassy in Northern Ireland but Brussels officials will be permitted at border checks in the region once the transition period ends The supply of medicines from GB to Northern Ireland will also avoid disruption, with the industry granted a period of 12 months to adapt to the changes On Wednesday, Downing Street said""very large gaps remain between the two sides""on a trade deal after Prime Minister Boris Johnson met European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in Brussels. The leaders agreed that ""by Sunday a firm decision should be taken about the future of the talks"", a source told the BBC. Ursula von der Leyen confirmed that positions remained ""far apart"", adding that negotiating teams ""should immediately reconvene to try to resolve these essential issues"". ""We will come to a decision by the end of the weekend,"" she said. Outlining details of the agreement reached with the EU on the NI Protocol in parliament on Wednesday, Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove said the government had heard ""loud and clear"" the concerns of supermarket firms and that more flexibility was needed. From 1 January, Northern Ireland will stay in the EU single market for goods, but the rest of the UK will leave. That means a proportion of food products arriving in Northern Ireland from Great Britain will need to be checked. Michael Gove outlined the contents of the agreement in the House of Commons The EU has strict rules on products of animal origin: meat, milk, fish and eggs. These products must enter through a border control post where paperwork is checked and a proportion of goods are physically inspected. Several supermarket chains had warned the supply ofsome products from GB to NI could be reduced, due to extra administrative burdens. On Wednesday,Britain's biggest supermarket Tesco said it was stockpiling food ahead of a potential no-deal Brexit. Mr Gove said the agreement ""also prevents any disruption at the end of the transition period on the movements of chilled meats"". ""British sausages will continue to make their way to Belfast and Ballymena in the new year,"" he added. There is going to be a hard Brexit but the EU and UK are trying to give Northern Ireland a soft landing. The immediate fear about disruption to the flows of supermarket goods across the Irish Sea is addressed with a three-month ""grace period"". But what happens after that? Will there be time to negotiate a more durable arrangement or is this about giving supermarkets time to source more goods on the island of Ireland? And what about those food suppliers which aren't supermarkets? They are anxiously seeking more details. Read more:'Devil in detail' as NI deal gets guarded welcome But Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) Westminster leader, said ""safeguarding the union is not a three-month project"" - but an enduring commitment. He asked Mr Gove to commit, if necessary, to introducing ongoing ""safeguard measures"" to maintain unfettered access between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. The DUPhad opposed the protocol in Parliament, arguing it would create a divide between NI and the rest of the UK that threatened to break up the union. Brexit happened but rules didn't change at once:The UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020, but leaders needed time to negotiate a deal for life afterwards - they got 11 months. Talks are happening:The UK and the EU have until 31 December 2020 to agree a trade deal as well as other things, such as fishing rights. If there is no deal:Border checks and taxes will be introduced for goods travelling between the UK and the EU. But deal or no deal, we will still see changes. What happens next with Brexit? Mr Gove said the government had delivered on its commitment to ensure unfettered access for NI firms shipping goods to the rest of the UK. ""No additional requirements will be placed on NI businesses for these movements, with the very limited and specific exception of trade in endangered species and conflict diamonds,"" he said. Belfast Port will be one of the locations where officials will continue to enforce EU customs codes after 1 January The Northern Ireland Protocol created a category of ""at risk goods"". These are goods which the EU fear could travel from GB through NI into the Republic of Ireland and the wider EU, without paying the correct EU tariff. The protocol makes a provision for tariffs to be charged on these goods. It was feared that a large proportion of goods going from GB-NI could have attracted tariffs in this way. ""Internal UK trade will be protected as we promised - whether we have a free trade agreement or not,"" said Mr Gove. The ""at risk"" goods problem would be almost entirely solved if there was a trade deal between the EU and UK, eliminating tariffs on all goods. But in the absence of a trade deal the trusted trader scheme would minimise the issue. The government also confirmed there will be an EU presence in NI after 1 January, but Mr Gove said it would not amount to a ""Belfast mini-embassy"". ""The EU officials will not have any powers to carry out checks themselves,"" he said, adding there would be ""sensible and practical"" cooperation and data sharing on both sides. Downing Street said it remained committed to peace and prosperity in Northern Ireland and that NI Secretary Brandon Lewis would shortly set out further measures of financial support to help businesses and communities in NI. Its fundamental purpose is to prevent a hardening of the land border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. It does that by keeping Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods and by having Northern Ireland apply EU customs rules at its ports. That means goods arriving from Great Britain are supposed to be checked and controlled at Northern Ireland's ports from 1 January. This arrangement will apply whether or not a wider trade deal is agreed. It will also mean when relevant EU laws are amended or new ones are drawn up, they will apply in Northern Ireland. Under the plan, NI will leave the EU customs union with the rest of the UK at the end of this year, but will continue to enforce the EU's customs code at its ports.

Thanks for following along with us. We hope you'll come back to join us later. Reality Check The post-Brexit trade talks between the UK and the EU are going down to the wire, and need to make progress in the next few days if a deal is to emerge before the end of the year. But the negotiators appear to have hit a brick wall on some fundamental issues.  Our Reality Check team look at the issues in detailhere Chris MorrisBBC Reality Check The prime minister has repeatedly talked about leaving the
European Union with an Australia-style deal â if he canât reach a trade deal
with the EU -  and he did so again at Prime Ministerâs Questions today. What an âAustralia-styleâ arrangement means is no deal with
the EU on free trade, no agreement on removing tariffs (or taxes) on goods
crossing borders, and having to rely on the basic rules of the World Trade
Organisation (WTO). Other countries â including the United States â trade with
the EU on WTO terms, but they also have a variety of separate agreements easing
trade in various sectors of the economy (as does Australia). The UK would not have any such agreements if talks with the
EU break down. Australia itself has been negotiating a free trade deal with
the EU since 2018, but it does far less trade with the EU than the UK does. You can read more about this here. This video can not be played PMQs: Johnson and Leigh on UK-EU post Brexit trade talks As we wrap up our coverage of events in the Commons this afternoon, all eyes in Westminster will now begin to move their gaze to the talks this evening in Brussels. Boris Johnson will have dinner tonight with EU Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen.  The dinner is expected to begin at 19:00 GMT. The PM and Mrs Von der Leyen will work through a list of the major sticking points in the Brexit talks. At PMQs earlier, Mr Johnson told MPs ""a good deal is still there to be done"".  But he suggested the EU could not accept the UK having sovereign control over its fishing waters after Brexit.. Time is running out to reach a deal before 31 December, when the UK stops following EU trading rules. Read more on tonight's talks here. Conservative Simon Hoare - who chairs the Common's Northern Ireland Committee - closes the session with the final question to Mr Gove. He congratulates him for protecting theGood Friday Agreementand upholding the rule of law. He asks for assurances that during the grace period, businesses will be supported and helped through the new customs regime. Michael Gove says concluding this agreement ""is just one step"" and the government needs to continue supporting businesses in Northern Ireland, ""large and small"" through the months ahead.  Port of Belfast On Tuesday, the UK and EU reached an agreement on how the new Irish Sea border will operate after the UK leaves the current border arrangements on 31 December. Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove has been outlining further details of the agreement reached with the EU on how the Northern Ireland part of the Brexit withdrawal deal - known as the Protocol - will work. Mr Gove told MPs supermarkets will be given a ""grace period"" to ensure food supplies from GB to NI do not face disruption. Read more here.  Japanese carmaker Honda has warned thatproduction at its Swindon plant will be disrupted, after transport problems caused a shortage of parts. Labour's Matt Western raises the paused production with Mr Gove, asking if this is the fault of the government or Honda. Mr Gove replies to say there is a ""global problem in container traffic"" which has been well-documented. Labour's Chi Onwurah asks what deal businesses should be preparing for, because there is no clarity. She adds that small businesses are being affected by the pandemic already are now facing Brexit uncertainty. Much of what most small businesses need to do is ""broadly the same"" says Michael Gove. The fate and future of businesses in the North East are ""very dear to me"". He adds that these areas in the North East are now voting Conservative because ""we stand up for workers"". Conservative MP Marco Longhi seeks assurance that if there is a trade agreement ""the government will not compromise on fishing, borders and laws"". Michael Gove replies that he is ""bang on"". Another Conservative, Miriam Cates, wants to know that the government will keep in place the rest of the Internal Market Bill. She says it is important to ensure goods can flow across all four nations Michael Gove says the bill is a ""critical law"" which safeguards the rights of consumers and businesses. He says he hopes the bill will passnow the controversial clauses have been removed. ""Northern Ireland Protocol"", ""unfettered access"", ""withdrawal agreement"".

Currys asked to honour lost Black Friday salesShoppers say they are being charged full price to re-order products cancelled because of a fault.,"Currys PC World said its website was processing about six orders per second at times on Black Friday Currys PC World is facing a growing number of complaints about cancelled Black Friday purchases, which customers only learned about after the sales period was over. The firm has blamed a technical fault for causing some orders to fail even though it had sent confirmation emails. The electronics retailer has apologised for ""the inconvenience caused"". But many of those involved want it to go further and to honour the discounts it had offered. A spokeswoman for the company  - which is owned by Dixons Carphone - was unable to say how many people had been affected. But she indicated the firm would treat complaints on a case-by-case basis. The issue follows reports of a related problem involving customers being left out of pocket after failed gift card payments to Currys PC World on Black Friday, which wasrevealed by MoneySavingExpert's news site last month,external. In those cases, the companyhas allowed goods to be repurchased at their discounted prices,external. However, it has subsequently emerged that other types of purchases were also affected. Deals for reduced-priced televisions, computers and speakers are among those shoppers have complained of missing out on. ""I had ordered a 65in TV in the Black Friday sale,"" Iain Fairfield from Kilwinning told the BBC. ""But it never arrived, so I went onto live chat with Currys and they said that due to a technical glitch the order hadn't gone through properly, even though I had confirmation of it. ""They then informed me that I would have to pay full price for the TV again even though it was a Black Friday deal. ""I was very angry with this as they wouldn't be honouring the original price I had got the item for. And at no point did they ever inform me, from purchase point until delivery day, that the order had been cancelled."" Charlie, another shopper who asked that his surname not be published, said he had a similar experience after a laptop he had ordered was not delivered. ""Glitches happen, everyone understands that. But not offering the goods now at [what was] the advertised price seems wrong,"" he said. ""What's most irritating is that I would have carried on shopping around on Black Friday had I known the sale hadn't gone through."" In some cases Currys did email users to inform them of the cancellations, but it appears not others. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The company is now working through complaints, but the extent of the problem is still unclear. ""Due to the unprecedented volume of customers shopping online with Currys PC World on Black Friday, our website experienced a temporary outage,"" said a spokeswoman. ""We can confirm that transactions made by gift cards and some Order & Collect purchases were affected, but home delivery was not.

'Price rises likely' due to UK shipping problems,"A container ship docked at Felixstowe port last month Businesses say a global shipping crisis is causing freight costs to soar and UK consumers may soon see price rises for imported goods. On top of skyrocketing shipping rates, carriers are adding congestion charges for imports to Felixstowe and Southampton, because of severe delays. The logistics industry has written to the Department for Transport calling for it to help clear port backlogs. One freight director said the UK's ports are currently ""broken"". Global shipping schedules were initially disrupted during the early stages of the pandemic, but recently a surge in demand for imports and a backlog of empty shipping containers are causing bottlenecks at UK ports. This week, two major cargo shipping companies, Maersk and MSC, said they were swapping Felixstowe port for Liverpool in order to ""provide stability"" to their transatlantic trade services. Alex Veitch, boss of trade group Logistics UK, blamed the disruption on ""the three C's"". ""It's the Christmas rush, coronavirus, which is still causing supply chain disruption, and now customs - or the uncertainty around it, with businesses taking the decision to move goods in and out of the UK in case there is a no-deal Brexit,"" he told the BBC. Home appliance importer Adam Russell says it's ""near impossible"" to ship goods out of China Adam Russell, who imports home appliances such as heaters and air conditioners for One Retail Group based in London, said the situation is ""scary"". ""We used to pay $2,000 to ship a 40-ft container to the UK, now we're paying at least $8,000 up to $10,000. ""Ultimately that means we're going to have to stop importing or we're going to have to pass that on to the consumer."" He said it's ""near impossible"" to get goods out of China now because fewer vessels than normal are sailing to the UK and there's also a shortage of empty containers ready to be filled in Chinese ports. He's not the only one facing disruption: Major shipping companies including Marseille-based CMA-CGM have told UK importers no more bookings can be made for ships sailing from Asia until the last week of December. TheJapanese carmaker Honda said delays at UK portsare holding up imports of parts and production will temporarily cease at its Swindon plant from Wednesday. The Builders Merchants Federation has also complained of delays for building supplies such as screws and timber, crucial for building new homes. Organisations representing the UK's ports, shipping and logistics sectors have written to Transport Secretary Grant Shapps, urging the government to do what it can to improve the situation. ""We recognise government's capacity to step in is limited, but where they can, they should look at ways of increasing the capacity for moving containers on and off ports,"" said Tim Morris, chief executive of the UK Major Ports Group. ""That could mean running more and longer trains to and from ports, allowing hauliers more flexibility to collect containers out of normal hours, and for drivers to take on longer shifts where that can be done safely."" The UK Chamber of Shipping said the shipping industry was not in crisis but acknowledged the backlogs, adding: ""We are confident the resilience within the supply chain can cope with this disruption."" The letter to the Transport Secretary also warns of further potential disruption when the Brexit transition period ends on 31 December. The Department for Transport said partners across government are working closely with the freight industry to resolve the challenges. Logistics firms that are responsible for transporting goods from ports to warehouses say the situation is creating huge amounts of stress. ""We've had one staff member leave because she can't take the customer complaints,"" said Ryan Clark, director of the Essex-based freight forwarder Westbound Logistics Services. Mr Clark said that as shipping orders into the UK have surged, the unloading time for vessels has increased. That means there are fewer berthing slots available at ports and congestion problems are getting worse. Problems that have been plaguing Felixstowe for weeks have now spread to Southampton and the system is ""broken"", he said. ""The increase in freight is either creating more expensive prices for the consumer, or unsustainability for businesses that will be forced to close where the onward price cannot be increased."" Honda warns of parts shortage due to UK port woes Felixstowe port in 'chaos' as Christmas and Brexit loom Port troubles leave UK bookseller with no books A spokesperson for DP World in the UK, which operates Southampton port, said: ""We are currently dealing with higher than usual yard volumes and also bad weather, including fog, leading to our truck turnaround times being longer. ""We expect levels to return to normal over the next week."" Paving importer Ben Charlton said shipping services have become ""shockingly unreliable"" But Ben Charlton, a business manager for paving importer Hanson Stone, based in Mansfield, said logistics firms are telling him it will be two to three months before the situation returns to normal. He said he's been waiting since the start of the month for containers to be unloaded at Felixstowe. ""We're a start-up company, we've only been running a year, we've had Covid to contend with, and now we've got this,"" he said. He says he is paying about Â£1,200 more per container in increased shipping costs which adds up. The company also operates on a credit system, where suppliers in India are paid 30-60 days after the stock arrives in the UK but the delays at Felixstowe are making cash flow a problem. ""Ultimately it's [all] going to get passed on to the end consumer and landscaping companies who buy from us down the line,"" he said. Eleanor Hadland, a ports analyst at the maritime consultancy Drewry, said ""the whole global container supply chain is basically out of balance"". The system stopped working properly when economies in various parts of the world shut down and re-opened at different times, as they dealt with Covid-19, she said. She warned the end result could resemble the credit crunch of 2008 when importers' lines of credit dried up. ""If the time it takes to receive goods at your shop is lengthening, you're having to find the cash to pay your suppliers sooner,"" she said, and that could have huge ramifications for global trade. ""What we're seeing is a trend away from globalised supply chains and people looking to buy goods regionally,"" she said.

"Biden vows 100m vaccinations in first 100 daysThe US president-elect says he cannot promise to end Covid quickly, but he can change its course.US & CanadaRich countries 'hoarding Covid vaccines'Poorer nations will miss out despite steps to ensure access is fair, campaigners warn.HealthComments","This video can not be played ""Masking, vaccinations, opening schools"": Joe Biden's key goals for his first 100 days US President-elect Joe Biden has set a goal of 100 million Covid vaccinations in his first 100 days in office. He said his first months in office would not end the outbreak and gave few details on a rollout plan but he said he would change the course of Covid-19. Introducing his health team for when he takes office on 20 January, he urged Americans to ""mask up for 100 days"". On Tuesday, a report paved the way for a Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine to be approved and rolled out for Americans. Emergency authorisation for its use could be issued by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Thursday, with the country's top infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci sayingmass vaccination could start as soon as next week. Also on Tuesday, President Donald Trump attended a summit at the White House of his Covid-19 vaccination programme, Operation Warp Speed, and hailed the expected approval of vaccines. His administration hopes to vaccinate as many as 24 million people by mid-January. The US has recorded more than 15 million cases so far and 285,000 deaths,according to Johns Hopkins University research,external, both global highs. Many parts of the country are seeing peak infections, with record numbers of people in hospital, with some experts blaming travel by millions over the recent Thanksgiving holiday. Safety data on Pfizer jab released by US How many doses will be given to each US state Where has been hit hardest? At a news conference on Tuesday, Mr Biden laid out how he plans to address the pandemic in his first 100 days in office. That period is traditionally seen as a benchmark for new presidents to make their mark with new policies and ideas. He vowed to get ""at least 100 million Covid vaccine shots into the arms of the American people"". ""My first 100 days won't end the Covid-19 virus. I can't promise that. But we did not get into this mess quickly. We're not going to get out of it quickly,"" he said at the event in Delaware, giving few details of how the largest vaccination programme in US history would be carried out. This video can not be played One travel nurse's journey to US Covid hotspots Last week, Mr Biden complained he had been given no rollout plans by the Trump administration. Operation Warp Speed's top scientist Moncef Slaoui has still to meet the Biden team and is expected to do so this week. Getting children back to school would also be a priority, the president-elect said. Mr Biden also introduced California Attorney General Xavier Becerra as his nomination for health secretary and his choice of Rochelle Walensky as head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Among his other aides will be Dr Anthony Fauci as chief Covid medical adviser. The expert also advised the Trump team and often fell foul of the president for his views. Getting 100 million vaccines to Americans in just over three months is not expected to be easy. The large geographical size of the US and the logistics of rolling out a new vaccine could present challenges in achieving the goal. Helen Branswell, senior writer on global health at US-based website Stat News, has described Mr Biden's plan as ""potentially realistic"" if the supplies of the drug are available and Mr Trump successfully begins the vaccination programme before his term ends. ""I think the early part of the vaccine delivery programme is going to be very bumpy in the US so by the time he [Mr Biden] takes office some of those bumps may have been levelled out a bit,"" Ms Branswell told the BBC. This video can not be played Five challenges of distributing a Covid-19 vaccine around the world Dr Fauci suggested the plan was ""bold but doable"", warning ""the road ahead will not be easy"". By comparison, 51.8% of Americans older than six months were vaccinated against flu in 2019-20,according to the CDC,external. The US population is 316 million people, which means that around 158 million people were given flu jabs between July 2019 and May 2020. In the UK, the government says it aims to vaccinate 800,000 people over the next few weeks after it beganthe world's first approved rollout of the vaccine. The event was mainly a celebration of Operation Warp Speed's efforts to get a vaccine to the American people. President Trump said of the expected vaccine approvals: ""They say it's somewhat of a miracle and I think that's true."" He added: ""Every American who wants the vaccine will be able to get the vaccine and we think by spring we're going to be in a position nobody would have believed possible just a few months ago."" This video can not be played Trump: ""Every American who wants the Covid vaccine will get it"" The president also signed an executive order aimed at ensuring that Americans had first priority in receiving doses. But it remains unclear how that will affect contracts that US companies have already signed with other countries. The Trump administration did sign up for an initial 100 million doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine but a member of the Pfizer board said the chance to buy more was turned down a number of times and more doses might not be available until June. The Operation Warp Speed team said its policy was to deal with a number of manufacturers of vaccines. US media reported the executive order reflected concern that supplies might not be enough. On Tuesday, US regulators confirmed the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid vaccine was 95% effective, paving the way for it to be approved for emergency use. The FDA found no safety concerns to stop approval of the vaccine. Although two doses are needed to offer full protection, the first jab prevented 89% of the most severe cases. Some side-effects such as redness or swelling at the injection site, short-term fatigue, headaches and muscle-pain were reported but were considered mild. US biotech firm Moderna has reported similar successes with its vaccine and it is also expected to get FDA approval before Christmas. Estimates of the cost of both vaccines are in-line with the flu jab, which is about $40 (Â£30) per person in the US. Mr Trump's government is taking steps to provide the vaccine at no cost to elderly people and those who receive government assistance for healthcare costs,according to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS).,external Meanwhile, the coalition People's Vaccine Alliance warned thatrich countries were hoarding doses of Covid-19 vaccinesand people living in poor countries were set to miss out.

"Rich countries 'hoarding Covid vaccines'Poorer nations will miss out despite steps to ensure access is fair, campaigners warn.HealthComments","Rich countries are hoarding doses of Covid vaccines and people living in poor countries are set to miss out, a coalition of campaigning bodies warns. The People's Vaccine Alliance says nearly 70 lower-income countries will only be able to vaccinate one in 10 people. This is despite Oxford-AstraZeneca pledging to provide 64% of its doses to people in developing nations. Steps are being taken to ensure access to vaccines is fair around the globe. This vaccine commitment, known as Covax, has managed to secure 700 million doses of vaccines to be distributed between the 92 lower-income countries that have signed up. This video can not be played Five challenges of distributing a Covid-19 vaccine around the world. But even with this plan in place,the People's Vaccine Alliance - a network of organisations including Amnesty International, Oxfam and Global Justice Now - says there is not enough to go round,external, and drug companies should share their technology to make sure more doses are produced. Their analysis found that rich countries have bought enough doses to vaccinate their entire populations three times over if all the vaccines are approved for use. Canada, for example, has ordered enough vaccines to protect each Canadian five times, it claims. And even though rich nations represent just 14% of the world's population, they have bought up 53% of the most promising vaccines so far, according to data from eight leading vaccine candidates in Phase 3 trials that have done substantial deals with countries worldwide. Will countries be left behind in the vaccine race? What you need to know about vaccine safety ""No-one should be blocked from getting a life-saving vaccine because of the country they live in or the amount of money in their pocket,"" said Anna Marriott, Oxfam's health policy manager. ""But unless something changes dramatically, billions of people around the world will not receive a safe and effective vaccine for Covid-19 for years to come."" The People's Vaccine Alliance is calling on all pharmaceutical corporations working on Covid-19 vaccines to openly share their technology and intellectual property so that billions more doses can be manufactured and made available to everyone who needs them. This can be done through the World Health Organization Covid-19 technology access pool, it says. This video can not be played 90-year-old woman first to get Pfizer vaccine The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine has already received approval in the UK and the most vulnerable are starting to be vaccinated this week. It is likely to receive approval from regulators in the US and Europe soon. Two other vaccines, from Moderna and Oxford-AstraZeneca, are awaiting regulatory approval in a number of countries. The alliance says that, so far, all of Moderna's doses and 90% of Pfizer/BioNTech's have been acquired by rich countries. AstraZeneca, the company manufacturing the Covid vaccine developed by the University of Oxford, has committed to making it available on a not-for-profit basis to the developing world. It is cheaper than the others and can be stored at fridge temperatures, making it easier to distribute across the globe. While the alliance called this ""a welcome contrast"", it said Oxford/AstraZeneca could ""still only reach 18% of the world's population next year at most"" and ""demonstrates that one company alone cannot hope to supply the whole world"". The Russian vaccine, Sputnik, has also announced positive trial results, and four other vaccines are going through late-stage clinical trials. Meanwhile, shipments of Beijing-based biopharmaceutical companySinovac's Covid-19 vaccine Coronavac have arrived in Indonesiain preparation for a mass vaccination campaign, even though it is yet to finish its late-stage trials.

US Supreme Court rejects bid to overturn Biden winRepublicans in Pennsylvania wanted to overturn certification of Joe Biden's victory in the state.US & Canada,"Supporters of Donald Trump demonstrated outside the Supreme Court on Tuesday The US Supreme Court has rejected a challenge against President-elect Joe Biden's victory in Pennsylvania. Republicans in the state wanted to overturn certification of the result, but justices rejected the request in a one sentence ruling. It is a blow to President Donald Trump, who has previously suggested without evidence that the election result would be settled in the Supreme Court. Mr Trump lost his bid for re-election last month. Since then he and his supporters have launched dozens of lawsuits questioning the vote results. None have come close to overturning Mr Biden's victory. Where does the Republican Party go after Trump? 'Overvoting' and other US fraud claims fact-checked Can Trump overturn the election result? The Democratic candidate defeated Mr Trump by a margin of 306 to 232 votes in the US electoral college, which chooses the US president. Mr Biden won seven million more votes than the president nationwide. Pennsylvania's Governor Tom Wolf has already certified Mr Biden's victory in the state. Under the rules of the electoral college, the state's 20 electors will meet on 14 December to officially cast their votes for the president-elect. Republicans in the state however wanted to overturn Mr Wolf's certification. The state's top court had rejected their bid last week, which made them appeal to the US Supreme Court in Washington. This video can not be played How are Biden voters in a Trump heartland dealing with the election aftermath? Lawyers for the state and Governor Wolf criticised the case as ""fundamentally frivolous"". ""No court has ever issued an order nullifying a governor's certification of presidential election results,"" they wrote. And on Tuesday the Supreme Court dismissed the suit.The one-sentence ruling,externaldid not even cover the Republicans' allegations, reading simply: ""The application for injunctive relief presented to Justice Alito and by him referred to the Court is denied."" Before, during and after the election, Mr Trump has made unsubstantiated claims of electoral fraud and suggested that the result would eventually be decided in the Supreme Court. The president appointed three of the court's justices during his single term in office. Most recently he controversially placed conservative judge Amy Coney Barrett on the bench after the death of the court's most liberal justice, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, just weeks before the election.

Currys asked to honour lost Black Friday sales,"Currys PC World said its website was processing about six orders per second at times on Black Friday Currys PC World is facing a growing number of complaints about cancelled Black Friday purchases, which customers only learned about after the sales period was over. The firm has blamed a technical fault for causing some orders to fail even though it had sent confirmation emails. The electronics retailer has apologised for ""the inconvenience caused"". But many of those involved want it to go further and to honour the discounts it had offered. A spokeswoman for the company  - which is owned by Dixons Carphone - was unable to say how many people had been affected. But she indicated the firm would treat complaints on a case-by-case basis. The issue follows reports of a related problem involving customers being left out of pocket after failed gift card payments to Currys PC World on Black Friday, which wasrevealed by MoneySavingExpert's news site last month,external. In those cases, the companyhas allowed goods to be repurchased at their discounted prices,external. However, it has subsequently emerged that other types of purchases were also affected. Deals for reduced-priced televisions, computers and speakers are among those shoppers have complained of missing out on. ""I had ordered a 65in TV in the Black Friday sale,"" Iain Fairfield from Kilwinning told the BBC. ""But it never arrived, so I went onto live chat with Currys and they said that due to a technical glitch the order hadn't gone through properly, even though I had confirmation of it. ""They then informed me that I would have to pay full price for the TV again even though it was a Black Friday deal. ""I was very angry with this as they wouldn't be honouring the original price I had got the item for. And at no point did they ever inform me, from purchase point until delivery day, that the order had been cancelled."" Charlie, another shopper who asked that his surname not be published, said he had a similar experience after a laptop he had ordered was not delivered. ""Glitches happen, everyone understands that. But not offering the goods now at [what was] the advertised price seems wrong,"" he said. ""What's most irritating is that I would have carried on shopping around on Black Friday had I known the sale hadn't gone through."" In some cases Currys did email users to inform them of the cancellations, but it appears not others. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""We can confirm that transactions made by gift cards and some Order & Collect purchases were affected, but home delivery was not. ""Any customer who paid by gift card had funds put back in full by 20:00 on Wednesday 2 December.

However, the BBC has spoken to four customers who said they were affected after trying to buy products for home delivery without using a gift card. The firm said it was still looking into the matter and urged all those affected to contact customer services if they still had a proof of purchase.

"Key to Norman tower returned 50 years onThe mystery sender, who said they ""borrowed"" the key in 1973 wrote: ""Sorry for the delay.""Kent","St Leonard's Tower is a well-preserved example of a small, free-standing Norman tower keep. A key which opened the doors of an 11th Century tower has been returned almost 50 years after it disappeared. The brass key to St Leonard's Tower in West Malling, Kent, was sent along with an anonymous note to English Heritage. The mystery sender, who said they ""borrowed"" the key in 1973 wrote: ""Sorry for the delay."" English Heritage properties curator Samantha Stone said the sender was not in trouble and hoped they would get back in touch to give more information. ""Sorry for the delay"", wrote the sender, after having the key for almost 50 years The key - thought to have been made at some point in the 19th Century - still fits in the keyhole of the doors to the Norman tower keep, although it no longer rotates. Very little is known about the history of the building or its original purpose. Some believe the tower was once part of a castle, built by Gundulf, Bishop of Rochester, while others say the builder was Bishop Odo of Bayeux, the half-brother of William the Conqueror. The key fits in the lock, but no longer works as the locks were changed Speaking to BBC's Today programme, Ms Stone said: ""There is no evidence of latrines or fireplaces, or anything that would suggest a domestic purpose, so its purpose has always been slightly mysterious. ""We assume it was for the administration of the bishop's manor. ""So the mystery of the key is very fitting in the wider history of the tower."" She said the sender had ""kept it safe all this time, which shows some care and dedication"" and English Heritage was ""very grateful"" and intrigued by the unusual story. She urged the sender to get back in touch, saying she would like to offer them English Heritage membership.

Low-carbon revolution 'cheaper than thought',"A landmark report says the UK can make major cuts to carbon emissions more cheaply than previously thought. The Climate Change Committee says that, for less than 1% of national wealth, the UK can reduce 78% of emissions by 2035, based on 1990 levels. This brings forward the UKâs clean energy timetable by 15 years - a previously unimaginable leap. The report says the low costs for the transformation are due to new clean technologies also being more efficient. The authors say people can play their part by eating less red meat, curbing flying, driving less and installing low-carbon heating. They estimate the costs of the low-carbon revolution will scale up to an annual Â£50bn by 2030 from around $10bn today, with most being private investment. PM's climate vision: 10 steps forward, 10 steps back? UK climate plan: What do the terms mean? 'Ditch high definition to fight climate change' By 2030, they estimate that some of these costs will be offset by fuel savings of Â£18bn. Prof Euan Nisbet from Royal Holloway, University of London, who was not involved with the report, said: ""This is a massively important report that maps out a whole new economy for Britain to create a better country. âThis shows it can be done. It can be afforded. This is world-leading, and itâll persuade other countries also to follow the path.â But sceptics say that the committee, which advises the government on climate matters, has underestimated the eventual bill and overestimated the governmentâs ability to deliver change on the scale projected. Some experts believe that dangerous climate change may already have occurred But the committee, also known as the CCC, says: âThe message to the government is clear: the 2020s must be the decisive decade of progress and action on climate changeâ. If its recommendations are carried out, the CCC says the UK will achieve its share of the UN target agreed under the Paris agreement drafted five years ago. This international deal aims to keep the global temperature rise well below 2C and âpursue effortsâ to keep it under 1.5C. So far, temperatures have increased around 1.1C and are contributing to devastating forest fires and ice loss at the poles. As a result, some scientists believe dangerous climate change may have already begun. CCC members say the targets proposed for the UK's âcarbon budgetâ period of 2033-2035 are definitely achievable, so long as the government moves urgently. The advisory body says the shift to electric vehicles will prove cheaper than sticking with petrol cars because the former is about three times more efficient. That means the government may need to claw back tax income by imposing pay-as-you-drive schemes. But the committee warns that ministers will need to shield the poorest in society. It will cost, for instance, an average of Â£10,000 to insulate a home and install low-carbon heating such as heat pumps. The report says the government must find Â£3-4bn a year to support households make the transition. Ministers will also need to cushion low-income households from whatâs estimated to be a Â£100-a-year rise in electricity bills by 2030, although the report says this cost may be reduced by making appliances more efficient. Environmental campaign groups have expressed delight that the costs of a clean society will be cheaper than previously thought, although they need convincing that the government will grasp the challenge. They point out that recently the Chancellor committed just Â£1bn to insulating homes to save emissions, whilst pledging Â£127bn to HS2 and new roads that will increase emissions. Large infrastructure projects funded by the Treasury could undermine efforts to cut carbon, say campaigners The report says to get the best results, the UK government must start cutting emissions aggressively, to prevent them accumulating in the atmosphere. It sets out the following conditions for success: To reduce demand for activities that increase carbon emissions. This means curbing the projected growth in flying and leaving cars at home wherever possible To reduce meat-eating. The committee thinks current dietary trends will result in a cut in red meat consumption of 24% by 2035, and suggests low-carbon lab-grown meat may be on the table by then To encourage the take-up of clean technology, such as electric cars, heat pumps, hydrogen boilers and carbon capture and storage (CCS) â where emissions are buried underground To expand low-carbon energy: wind power, solar power, hydrogen and, probably, nuclear To offset emissions that canât readily be cut by that time, such as from farming and aviation. This would include planting trees and using CCS. The report says: âMany people can make low-carbon choices, about how they travel, how they heat their homes, what they buy and what they eat.â It also includes a measure of popular opinion, gleaned through the recent UK Climate Assembly â where members of the public participated in sessions with climate experts to establish a dialogue on the best ways to cut emissions. The assembly called for a tax on frequent flyers, a ban on selling polluting sports utility vehicles (SUVs), and a cut in meat consumption - although it stressed that people shouldnât be coerced into changing behaviours. The CCC estimates that 16% of the effort to achieve the targets will come from behaviour change, such as shifts in diet or flying less. Another 41% will come from painless improvements in low carbon technology, and 43% will be a combination of technology and behaviour change. There will be a revolution in homes and how they're heated. This will involve insulating many more homes, making all new gas boilers hydrogen-ready - able to use cleaner hydrogen as a fuel - and making greater use of heat pumps.

French Alps helicopter crash kills five,"Private company Service AÃ©rien FranÃ§ais runs air services across France A helicopter has crashed in the French Alps killing five of the six people on board, officials say. The aircraft, owned by a private company, was carrying out a rescue mission when it went down near the town of Bonvillard in the Savoie area. The cause of the crash is unclear, but officials say it could have been caused by poor weather. The alarm was raised by the pilot who managed to escape from the helicopter and was found seriously injured. The helicopter belongs to Service AÃ©rien FranÃ§ais, a private company that conducts search-and-rescue missions and other air services across France. In a tweet, French President Emmanuel Macron shared ""support from the nation to the families, friend and colleagues of these French heroes"". French authorities said the helicopter - a Eurocopter EC135 - was carrying an air rescue crew on a training mission when it fell from an altitude of 1,800 metres (5,900ft). The surviving pilot raised the alarm at around 19:10 local time (18:10 GMT) after managing to escape from the helicopter. The crew onboard consisted of two pilots - one in training - along with two winch operators and two mountain rescue workers. Police union Synergie-Officiers hasnamed Amaury Lagroy de Croutte as one of the victims,external. Since 2018, Mr de Croutte had led a local mountain unit of the CRS, France's riot police. Three helicopters have been sent to the site as part of a rescue team of over 40 people. But the aircraft have been unable to reach the site due to fog. Instead, the pilot was recovered by a group of rescuers who approached on foot. French Interior Minister GÃ©rald Darmaninhas said he will visit the site of the incident on Wednesday,external.

Allergy warning over Covid vaccinePeople with history of significant allergic reactions told not to have Covid jab for the moment.Health,"People with a history of significant allergic reactions should not have the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid jab, regulators say. It came after two NHS workers had allergic reactions on Tuesday. The advice applies to those who have had reactions to medicines, food or vaccines, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency said. The two people had a reaction shortly after having the new jab, had treatment and are both fine now. They are understood to have had an anaphylactoid reaction, which tends to involve a skin rash, breathlessness and sometimes a drop in blood pressure. This is not the same as anaphylaxis which can be fatal. Both NHS workers have a history of serious allergies and carry adrenaline pens around with them. How does the Pfizer vaccine work? What you need to know about vaccine safety When can you get the Covid vaccine? Professor Stephen Powis, medical director for the NHS in England, said both individuals were recovering well. He said this was ""common with new vaccines"", describing it as a precautionary measure. Dr June Raine, head of the MHRA, said it was only right to take this step now that ""we've had this experience"". Reactions like this are uncommon, but do happen with other vaccines, including the annual flu jab. Several thousand people were vaccinated on Tuesday in hospital clinics on the first day of the UK rollout of the new Covid jab. Prof Peter Openshaw, an expert in immunology at Imperial College London, said: ""The fact that we know so soon about these two allergic reactions and that the regulator has acted on this to issue precautionary advice shows that this monitoring system is working well."" This is a story to assess with your head and not your gut. No effective medicine is without side effects so you have to balance the risk and the benefit. Remember, one in a thousand of the entire UK population have died after being infected with coronavirus this year and that figure is rising daily. Two people, out of thousands vaccinated yesterday, had an allergic reaction which they recovered from. Such reactions can happen with any vaccine and are treated with drugs such as steroids or adrenaline. The trials reportedone possible allergic reaction,externalper thousand people immunised that may have been related to the jab. The MHRA has given targeted advice to those most at risk, but for the overwhelming majority of people, this changes nothing. More from James:What you need to know about vaccine safety The development came after the NHS has announced the vaccination programme will be expanded out to GP surgeries from next week. Doses are expected to be delivered to around 200 GP surgeries initially to allow them to start on Tuesday. The over-80s will be invited first. Once the first 200 GP practices have received their doses the programme will be expanded out to more than 1,000 surgeries - with each local area having a designated site. It means most patients will be invited to a GP centre that is not their usual one. Similar arrangements are being made in the rest of the UK. Dr Richard Vautrey, GP leader from the British Medical Association, said GPs were ""ready to go"". ""We have a wealth of experience in delivering vaccines - and will be able to do millions of people a week. It is really dependent on supply and how quickly we can get our hands on it."" Meanwhile, one of the key people behind another Covid vaccine developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca has played down fears the jab may not be effective in older people. Data published by the Lancet on Tuesdaysuggested there was a lack of certainty over the effectiveness of the vaccine in the over-55s. Prof Sarah Gilbert said older people were only recruited into the trials later in the process, and the next trial results provided were likely to include information about how well the jab worked in people over the age of 55. But she said there ""was no difference"" in the immune response seen in younger adults and people over 70 in earlier trials. This meant the regulator could support licensing of the vaccine to the elderly, she said. The MHRA is currently considering the Oxford University-Astra Zeneca jab. The vaccine is crucial to fast rollout as it is much easier to store and distribute, because it does not need to be kept at ultra-cold temperatures. There are more than 5 million doses of the vaccine currently in the country. The latestdaily figures for the UK,external, published on Wednesday, showed a further 533 people have now died within 28 days of a positive Covid-19 test. A further 16,578 people have tested positive for Covid-19, taking the UK's total cases to 1,766,819. All's well that ends well?

for following our live coverage of the pandemic. Today's
live page was edited by Helier Cheung and Sarah Collerton and written by Becky
Morton, Joshua Nevett and Alex Therrien. We'll
be back with all the latest updates tomorrow morning. Margaret Keenan, the first person to receive the Pfizer vaccine outside medical trials, left hospital on Wednesday Weâre wrapping up our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic for the day soon. Before we do, letâs have a look at the stories that made headlines today, the 273rd day since a pandemic was declared by the World Health Organization (WHO). In the UK:  Elsewhere: Alistair ColemanBBC Monitoring Some people are claiming that this vaccine event was staged The roll-out of a coronavirus vaccine in the UK was met immediately - and predictably - by an uptick in misinformation and false claims online. Among posts on social media are claims that patients and
medical staff seen on television âwerenât real peopleâ, and that a âfake
vaccination eventâ was staged for the media. Although on the face of it these wild claims are
preposterous, we checked anyway â and found the theories full of holes. Take one allegation that gained traction on Twitter â that
yesterdayâs vaccination footage first appeared on CNNâs website in October. This, however, is a characteristic of the CNN websiteâs
video player - a feature used by many news organisations. What readers actually saw was a constantly updated playlist
of relevant stories, meaning new videos appear on older stories. Other untrue claims were even more contrived, alleging
actors and bizarre secret codes. One feature they seem to have in common is the lack of any real evidence. Weâve been tracking some of the more popular anti-vaccine conspiracy theories during the pandemic- theories that are far from legitimate questions or reports, such as todayâs reports of allergic reactions. The military has helped set up the testing site at Rochester Cathedral The crypt of England's second oldest cathedral has been turned into a coronavirus testing centre. Rochester Cathedral, which has stood in Medway, Kent, for some 1,400 years, is one of the area's new targeted community testing centres being run in partnership with the military. The county has some of the highest case numbers in the country and was recently placed under tier three - the highest level of restrictions in England. Residents without symptoms are being encouraged to book a test to help tackle a rise in infections. This video can not be played Covid: 'Don't mix with other outside household' plea People in Wales have been urged not to mix with others outside of their household between now and Christmas. The country's chief medical officer, Frank Atherton, told a Welsh government briefing: ""The best present we can give our families this year is a coronavirus-free Christmas."" Groups of four people from different householdsare allowed to meetindoors at pubs, cafes and restaurants. Previously the Welsh government had said people should limit themselves to seeing thesame ""one or two friends"". Dr Atherton said: ""We all have to work to reduce the number of people we have contact with between now and Christmas. ""My message on this is really very simple - don't mix with people outside your household between now and Christmas."" Read more  Oregon has experienced a surge in infections in recent weeks (file photo) A nurse in Oregon has been fired after claiming she does not
follow pandemic restrictions outside of her job. In a TikTok video apparently filmed in her hospitalâs break room,
Ashley Grames â a cancer nurse â said she does not wear a mask away from work.
She added that she still travels and lets her children have play dates. The now-deleted video caused a stir on social media, forcing Ms
Gramesâ employer Salem Health to condemn her behaviour andplace her on administrative leavepending an
investigation. The hospital told local media on Tuesday that it no longer employs
Ms Grames. State records also indicate she will stop practising nursing for
the time being, an agreement that will remain in effect until the state board
of nursing allows her to practice again. Oregon has experienced a surge of the virus over the past few
weeks, setting records in daily caseloads and hospital admissions. After the first Covid-19 peak in April, cases in the UK started rising again in July, with the rate of growth increasing sharply in September and October, before falling again in November following tougher restrictions. The rate of decline now appears to have slowed, with a further 16,578 confirmed cases announced by the government on Wednesday. It is thought the infection rate was much higher during the first peak in spring, but testing capacity at the time was too limited to detect the true number of daily cases. Lockdowns worldwide have reduced carbon emissions Flights have been grounded. Fewer cars have been on the roads. Economic activity has slowed. The coronavirus pandemic has brought much of life as we know it to a halt. As a result, carbon emissions are predicted to fall by about 7% globally this year,according to a new report by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP),external. Yet, this yearâs projected reduction in greenhouse gases will have a ânegligibleâ impact on climate change, the report says. The forecasted dip, it says, only translates to a 0.01C reduction of global warming by 2050. Such a reduction would do little to keep global temperatures within 2C of pre-industrial levels, the target set bythe Paris Agreement on climate change. A green pandemic recovery, however, can bring emissions close to levels needed to achieve the 2C goal by 2030, the report adds. While the report looks at the plans that governments have submitted to curb their CO2, it also examines the roles of lifestyles and consumption patterns of individuals. It says that the top 10% of earners would need to cut their carbon footprints to around one tenth of their current level to help restrict the rise in temperatures this century to 1.5C You can read more about these findingshere. The airline industry has been scuppered by the pandemic Robin Levinson KingBBC News, Toronto Canada hasofficially approved Pfizer's coronavirus vaccine, which means the first doses could be delivered by the end of the month. The drug will be indicated for people over 16-years-old, while its use in children continues to be studied, the health department said. Earlier this week, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said 249,000 doses could go out to people in long term-care homes as early as the end of December. In total, the Canadian government has purchased 20 million doses of the vaccine - enough to inoculate 10 million people - with the option to buy 56 million more. The country's population is about 37 million. That gives Canada the most doses per capita than anywhere else in the world,according to a recent study.,external Amnesty International has accused Canada,externaland other rich countries of ""hoarding"" the vaccine, and says it could lead to more deaths in the developing world. Maddy SavageBBC News, Stockholm Swedenâs capital has almost reached its limit for providing intensive care beds for the first time during the pandemic, with 99% of all spots filled with serious Covid-19 cases alongside other patients, according to BjÃ¶rn Eriksson, Health and Medical care director for the Stockholm region. He told a news conference that his team had thought they were seeing a âplateau or the beginning of a declineâ of coronavirus admissions, but that the opposite had happened. In a separate interview with major Swedish daily newspaper Dagens Nyheter, he admitted there was a risk that some patients in need of care may not be able to receive it, describing a âvery serious situationâ. Earlier this week intensive care staff from Blekinge in southern Sweden were called in to help doctors at Stockholmâs largest hospital, Karolinska. Sweden, which relied largely on voluntary social distancing guidelines at the start of the pandemic, has recently toughened its restrictions, banning public gatherings of more than eight people and alcohol sales after 10pm. Students over the age of 16 have also switched back to distance-learning, having returned to classrooms in August. However there are ongoing concerns about overcrowding in shops and on public transport. On Tuesday, Health Minister Lena Hallengren promised that everyone aged over 18 would be offered a Covid-19 vaccine within the first six months of 2021. The Pfizer/BioNtech vaccine must be stored at a temperature of -70C We can bring you a response from US Health Secretary Alex Azar to the vaccine advice issued by UK regulators earlier today. UK regulators have advised people with a history of significant allergic reactions against taking the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine. That's because two people had a reaction shortly after having the new jab, though they received treatment and are both fine now (read more about thishere). The vaccine is yet to be approved by the USâs regulatory body, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA),though it has found no safety concerns yet. In an interview with broadcaster CNN,external, Azar was asked if the advice issued in the UK would have any impact on the regulatory authorisation of the vaccine in the US. He said the FDA would examine the data on allergic reactions and speak to UK regulators. âFDA is going to not cut any corners,â Azar said. âTheyâre looking at the data. Theyâre looking under the hood at everything. So Iâm sure thatâll be something the FDA looks at here.â Helier CheungBBC News Hong Kong has had 7,180 coronavirus cases and 114 deaths Hong Kong is struggling under what officials are calling a ""fourth wave"". For several days in the past two weeks, the territory has seen more than 100 new infections per day - a sharp contrast from earlier this year, when the city seemed to have the outbreak contained, and some days with zero local transmissions. Now, authorities have banned dining in restaurants after 6pm - a significant move in a city where many work long hours, and eating out in an essential part of local culture. The government has also orderedcompulsory Covid-19 testing for taxi drivers,externalworking between over Christmas and January, and for residents oftwo housing estate blocks with clusters of infections,external. Mandatory testing is a touchy subject to some in Hong Kong - some activists have raised concerns that testing could be used to collect DNA samples for surveillance purposes - claims the authorities have dismissed as a smear campaign. A survey last month,externalfound 49% of people said they did not trust the government (compared to 30% who said they did). However, attitudes may be changing as infection numbers rise, says Victoria Hui, a Hong Konger and politics professor at Notre Dame University. ""While people didn't want to sign up before, there seems to be more acceptance of testing now... Covid-19 now seems to be the immediate concern, with the possibility of DNA collection becoming a secondary concern,"" she told the BBC. Margaret Keenan left hospital with her daughter Sue The 90-year-old grandmotherwho became the first person in the world to have the Pfizer vaccinehas been discharged from hospital. Margaret Keenan was admitted to University Hospital Coventry a few days before she was given the jab early on Tuesday. Mrs Keenan, who turns 91 next week, said the injection was the ""best early birthday present"". It was the first of 800,000 doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine that will be dispensed in the UK in the coming weeks. Burley is likely to be off screen until the New Year Sky News presenter Kay Burley and three colleagueshave been taken off airwhile an investigation into breaches of Covid guidelines is carried out. Political editor Beth Rigby, north of England correspondent Inzamam Rashid and presenter Sam Washington are off air while the inquiry takes place. BBC media editor Amol Rajan said Burley's job was hanging in the balance. It follows Burley's admission that she ""inadvertently broke the rules"" while celebrating her 60th birthday at the weekend. The journalist said she could ""only apologise"" for her ""error of judgment"". Writing on Twitter on Monday,external, Burley said she had been at a ""Covid compliant"" restaurant on Saturday and had later ""popped into another"" venue to use the toilet. Beth Rigby has also been taken off air Amol Rajan said she was one of a party of 10 people at the Century Club, a private members' club on London's Shaftesbury Avenue. Her group took up two tables, with six people on one and four on the other. Burley then went on to Folie restaurant, where she used the toilet, before moving on to a private residence where individuals from at least three households mixed, Rajan said. London is under tier two restrictions, which means people are not allowed to socialise with anyone from outside their household or support bubble indoors, either in a private home or a public place. The EU regulatory body is assessing whether Covid-19 vaccines are safe for use in European countries The medicines regulator for the European Union (EU) says it has been the victim of a cyber-attack. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) is currently working on approval of two Covid-19 vaccines, which it expects to conclude within weeks. The EMA did not say what the nature of the cyber-attack was, if it was successful, or if it was linked to the vaccine approval process. The agency authorises the use of medicines across the EU. It is trying to decide if the Pfizer/BioNTech jab - which is being rolled out in the UK - and another made by Moderna, are safe for use in EU countries. There has been a string of warnings about hacking threats against vaccine-makers and public health bodies. Security serviceswarned in the summer that Russian intelligencehad been targeting organisations attempting to develop a successful vaccine. Read the full story Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Care home worker Pillay Jagambrun, 61, receiving the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine on Tuesday One of the big unknowns about the vaccines that are being developed is whether they prevent people from passing on the virus. The trials that have taken place have only established that they stop people getting ill. But it is quite possible that someone who is vaccinated could still infect others. The assumption is vaccination will at least disrupt this to some extent - but it may not end transmission completely. For that reason, those who are vaccinated will still be expected to wear masks and self-isolate if they are a close contact of someone who is infected. That does not mean these precautions can never be lifted. Once all the vulnerable people are immunised, there will be a strong case that these steps are not needed â or at least not needed on the scale they are currently being used. However, it will take many months to get to that point. Masks, self-isolation and social distancing are here for a while. Marianna SpringSpecialist disinformation reporter Patricia from Texas is suffering from an unexplained skin condition on her feet - but a misunderstanding about what might have caused it set off a chain of events that turned her into fodder for anti-vaccine activists. Mistaken claims she was injured in a vaccine trial were shared on a fundraiser page. That fuelled rumours and conspiracy theories. They all were based on the idea that Patricia had received the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. She had been part of a trial, but medical records show that instead of the vaccine itself, she received a placebo, a small injection of salt water. Dermatologists confirmed that such an injection would not cause a skin reaction. That didn't stop activists twisting her story to advance their own agendas. The disinformation they fuelled online is worlds apart from legitimate safety concerns and todayâs reports about allergic reactions. On top of the physical pain caused by her condition, Patricia received a wave of online abuse. Read more The Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine has been deemed safe for use by regulators in Canada, paving the way for mass vaccination in the country. Health Canada approved the Covid-19 vaccine on Wednesday, shortly after the UK's move at the start of December. ""The approval of the vaccine is supported by evidence that it is safe, effective and of good quality,"" Health Canada said in a statement. On Monday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Canadians would start receiving their first doses of Pfizer's vaccine before the end of December. A further 533 coronavirus deaths have been recorded in the UK, taking the total number of people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for the virus to 62,566. The latest government figures,externalalso show there have been a further 16,578 cases across the UK. James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News Thestory about two people having allergic reactionsto the Pfizer/BioNTech jab is one to assess with your head and not your gut. No effective medicine is without side effects so you have to balance the risk and the benefit. Remember, one in 1,000 people in the UK have died after being infected with coronavirus this year and that figure is rising daily. Two people, out of thousands vaccinated yesterday, had an allergic reaction which they recovered from. Such reactions can happen with any vaccine and are treated with drugs such as steroids or adrenaline. The trials reportedone possible allergic reaction,externalper 1,000 people immunised that may have been related to the jab. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency has given targeted advice to those most at risk, but for the overwhelming majority of people this changes nothing.

First care home residents in NI receive Covid jab,"Residents at Palmerston have welcomed the vaccines The first care home residents have been vaccinated against Covid-19 in Northern Ireland. Twenty-five men and women from Palmerston residential home in east Belfast were vaccinated on Tuesday morning. Thirty-five members of staff are in the process of getting the jab. Earlier on Tuesday, the first Covid-19 vaccination in Northern Ireland was administered. Sister Joanna Sloan - who will head up the vaccine roll out in Belfast - received the jab just after 08:00 GMT at the Royal Victoria Hospital. The roll outinvolves 70 hospital hubs across the UK which are gearing up to provide the Pfizer/BioNTech jab. On Tuesday, the Belfast Trust confirmed to BBC Radio Ulster's Evening Extra programme that 250 people had received the vaccination in Northern Ireland. Margaret Keenan, who turns 91 next week, becamethe first person in the world to get the jab as part of a mass vaccination programme, She is originally from Enniskillen, County Fermanagh and called the vaccination the ""best early birthday present"". This video can not be played Coronavirus: First Covid-19 vaccine in NI given to nurse Palmerston is a purpose built dementia care home providing 24 hour care to older people in East Belfast. As well as the residents, 35 members of staff are in the process of  getting the jab. Speaking to BBC News NI, home manager Paul Johnston said it had been a ""good day"". The home had outbreaks of the virus in October but is now virus-free. Mr Johnston, who also was vaccinated, said it was only yesterday that he received the call from the Belfast Health Trust to arrange the vaccinations but was delighted and relieved to be able to protect the residents. ""We had to gain consent from the families - it has been full on but we are getting there,"" he said. ""Really it has been no different from administering the flu jab. It wasn't painful at all and so far so good with all the residents."" The Department of Health recorded 14 further deaths linked to Covid-19 on Tuesday, taking its total death toll to 1,073. It also confirmed 351 new positive cases of Covid-19, bringing the total number of positive cases in Northern Ireland to 55,795. In the Republic of Ireland, there was one further death linked to coronavirus reported, with 2,097 people having died in total. There were also 215 further confirmed cases of the virus, meaning there have been 74,682 cases recorded in the country since the pandemic began. The first recipient of the vaccine in Northern Ireland, Ms Sloan, will manage the Belfast Trust's vaccination centre. Speaking earlier on Tuesday, she said she felt emotional and proud to be part of history. This video can not be played Joanna Sloan on being the first person in NI to get a Covid-19 vaccine Meanwhile, a 90-year-old woman from Northern Irelandbecame the first person in the world to receive the vaccine outside trial conditions. Margaret Keenan, who turns 91 next week, said it was the ""best early birthday present"". The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is one of a number that have been developed so far, withOxford-AstraZenecaandModernaseeking approval for their vaccines. Health Minister Robin Swann hailed the vaccination rollout as a ""game changer"". Mr Swann warned that distribution of the vaccine would be a massive logistical challenge - particularly in care homes, which will require 12,000 doses -  but he said those in care homes would start to receive the vaccine soon. The vaccine must be stored at about -70C and needs to be transported in special boxes, packed in dry ice. Once delivered, it can be kept for up to five days in a fridge. NI woman gets first Covid-19 vaccine outisde trial conditions Mass vaccination programme begins Who will be the first to get the vaccine? Vaccine rumours debunked What are the safety checks for vaccines? Stocks of the vaccine were transported to Northern Ireland via the Republic of Ireland, having arrived into Dublin port from Holyhead. They are being kept at an undisclosed central storage facility operated by a private company. Dr Alan Stout, chairman of Northern Ireland's GP committee, warned the vaccine rollout did not symbolise the end of the pandemic. ""It is so important that people still follow the rules and follow the guidance,"" he told BBC Radio Foyle. More than 600 volunteer vaccinators across Northern Ireland will be given the injection this week, ahead of the biggest inoculation programme in UK history. The UK will be the first country in the world to start using the Pfizer vaccine after regulators approved its use last week. About 25,000 doses were delivered to Northern Ireland last Friday. Vaccination will not be compulsory. Ministers have warned it could be Easter by the time restrictions are lifted in a significant way. The vaccine will be rolled out at seven sites across Northern Ireland: â¢Belfast Trust - Royal Victoria Hospital, Belfast â¢South Eastern Trust - Ulster Hospital, Dundonald â¢Southern Trust - South Lake Leisure Centre, Craigavon â¢Northern Trust - Seven Towers Leisure Centre, Ballymena â¢Western Trust  - Foyle Arena, Londonderry, Omagh Leisure Centre and Lakeside Leisure Centre, Enniskillen.

Wales' Covid self-isolation period cut to 10 days,"The self-isolation period in Wales is currently 14 days - but that is changing All people who need to self-isolate or quarantine will only need to do so for 10 days from Thursday, the Welsh Government has announced. The current period for those without the virus is 14 days, which has been changed after medical endorsement. It will now apply to people who have tested positive for the virus or are at risk of having it, including those returning fromnon-exempt countries,external. It means Wales will have a shorter isolation period than England. Currently in England, the only people who have a 10-day isolation periodare those who have had a positive test or coronavirus symptoms,external, as has been the case in Wales. Contacts of those people must still isolate for 14 days. At present, people in Wales whose close contacts have coronavirus and travellers returning from non-exempt countries are required by law to self-isolate for 14 days - unless they subsequently test positive, in which case they are required to isolate for 10 days from the date of the positive test.

US Army leaders fired over abuse of women soldiers,"Serving soldier Vanessa Guillen, 20, was killed earlier this year The US Army has fired or suspended 14 commanders and lower-level leaders at the Fort Hood base in Texas over a pattern of violence there, including murder, sexual assaults and harassment. An investigation into problems at the base was launched following the killing of soldier Vanessa Guillen this year. Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy said the ""issues at Fort Hood are directly related to leadership failures"". The army has also ordered a new policy on dealing with missing soldiers. The firings and suspensions announced on Tuesday include major generals Scott Efflandt and Jeffery Broadwater. Mr McCarthy said Ms Guillen's murder ""shocked our conscience and brought attention to deeper problems"" at Fort Hood and in the US Army more widely. It ""forced us to take a critical look at our systems, our policies, and ourselves"", he told reporters. Ms Guillen, 20, was missing for about two monthsbefore her remains were found in late June. Investigators say she was bludgeoned to death at Fort Hood. The suspect in her death, Specialist Aaron Robinson,took his own life on 1 July as police were trying to take him into custody. Ms Guillen's family allege that she had been harassed by Mr Robinson, but officials say they have no report to indicate she was sexually harassed or assaulted. The case is still under investigation. This video can not be played Vanessa Guillen family: ""My sister is a human being, and I want justice"" The action by the US Army on Tuesday follows a year that saw 25 soldiers assigned to Fort Hood die as a result of suicide, homicide or accidents, according to the Associated Press news agency. A statement from the US Army said ""when a senior leader loses trust and confidence in a subordinate commander or leader, it is appropriate and necessary to relieve that person."" Mr McCarthy also announced on Tuesday a new policy aimed at ensuring that the army ""maximises efforts to find missing soldiers"". The policy requires commanders to classify missing soldiers as ""absent-unknown"" for up to 48 hours, while doing everything they can to locate the soldier and determine if their absence is voluntary before declaring them Awol, or absent without leave.

Uber sells off flying taxi unitElevate is the second business Uber has sold off this week as the company seeks profitability.,"Ride sharing business Uber has sold off its flying taxi unit Elevate to California-based electric aircraft developer Joby Aviation. Elevate is the second business Uber has sold off this week as the company seeks a path to profitability. On Monday, Uber announced the sale of its self-driving unit to autonomous vehicle start-up Aurora. Joby and Uber, however, described the latest transaction as an ""expanded partnership"". ""This deal allows us to deepen our partnership with Joby, the clear leader in this field, to accelerate the path to market for these technologies,"" Uber's chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi said in a statement. Uber sells self-driving cars to focus on profits Is the airborne commute a flight of fancy? Under the deal, Uber will also invest and additional $75m (Â£56m) in Joby Aviation. Elevate began in 2016 and, until earlier this year, its team had promised the launch of flying taxi services in Los Angeles, Dallas and Melbourne in 2023. Joby was a partner in Elevate before taking over the business, and the two companies said they would each integrate the other company's services into their own app. ""These tools and new team members will be invaluable to us as we accelerate our plans for commercial launch,"" said Joby founder JoeBen Bevirt in a statement. This video can not be played Volocopter's air taxi Joby said its ""zero emissions"" aircraft will seat four passengers and will feature vertical take-off and landing. It will have a range of up to 241km and a top speed of 321kmh, the company said. The company is currently still testing the aircraft. The latest move comes as Uber tries to cut costs in an effort to become profitable. Although Uber had promised investors that it will achieve profitability by the end of 2021, the company still reported a $625m loss last quarter. Uber was initially hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic, with rides - its main source of income - plummeting by about 80% in April, before rebounding. In order to reach profitability, the company has vowed to focus on its core ride-hailing and food delivery platforms, while cutting costs. In May, the company said it would slash thousands of jobs, while closing or consolidating more than 40 offices. In addition to selling off Elevate, Uber also sold off its driverless car subsidiary to Aurora Technologies on Monday, while taking a 26% stake in the driverless start-up. Driverless technologies were once seen as a key priority for Uber, but the program has faced numerous setbacks. One of its cars was involved in a deadly crash in Arizona, though officials blamed human error for the accident and declined to bring criminal charges against the company. The driverless car unit was also tangled up in legal fights over allegations of technology theft. Uber sells self-driving cars to focus on profits Is the airborne commute a flight of fancy?

Covid case cuts short Singapore 'cruise to nowhere',"The coronavirus pandemic has largely shut down the cruise industry A Royal Caribbean ship has returned to Singapore on day three of a four-day ""cruise to nowhere"" after a passenger tested positive for Covid-19. The city state's ""cruises to nowhere"" - starting and ending at the same port without stops - launched last month. They are an attempt to revive the hard-hit cruise industry, which largely came to a global standstill after ships saw  large outbreaks early in the pandemic. Singapore's special cruises are only open to its residents. The Royal Caribbean cruise ship Quantum of the Seas left Singapore on Monday for a four-day round trip as part of a ""safe cruising"" scheme announced by the country's tourism board in October. The cruise company said it had turned the ship around after one guest tested positive for coronavirus after checking in with the on-board medical team. Are cruise ships really 'floating Petri dishes'? The 'last cruise ship on Earth' finally comes home ""We identified and isolated all guests and crew who had close contact with this guest, and each of those individuals have subsequently tested negative for the virus,"" it said in a statement. The firm added that passengers would be allowed to disembark ""after a review of contact tracing is completed"". According to Singaporean daily newspaper The Straits Times, there were 1,680 guests and 1,448 crew members on board. The passenger who tested positive for Covid-19 was an 83-year-old Singaporean who first reported to the ship's medical centre with diarrhoea and underwent a coronavirus test as part of on-board protocols, it added. A raft of safety measures were introduced for passengers on the special cruises to nowhere, including Covid-19 tests before boarding and after disembarking. The ships were also running at half their usual capacity for safe distancing purposes. The first 'cruise to nowhere' launched on another ship in November with stringent safety checks ""That we were able to quickly identify this single case and take immediate action is a sign that the system is working as it was designed to do,"" said the Royal Caribbean. Late on Wednesday morning, a Reddit user, who said they were quarantined on the ship, posted that passengers were ""not cleared to disembark yet"". The user had first posted on the social media platform at 02:42 local time (18:43 GMT) to say the captain had just announced the cruise would be cut short due to the Covid-19 case. The cruise industry was hit hard early in the pandemic, whenthe virus first swept the Diamond Princess in Japanand thenthe Grand Princess in the US, resulting in passengers being quarantined at sea after hundreds contracted the virus onboard. Royal Caribbean has said another cruise scheduled to depart on Thursday will go ahead, local media reported. By Andreas Illmer, BBC News, Singapore Singaporeans are desperate to get off their little island. For months, the border has been effectively closed and the thirst for travel has taken bizarre forms like eating airline food on a plane parked on the tarmac or booking staycations at the airport. An eagerly awaited travel bubble with Hong Kong was delayed because of rising cases there. So the ""cruises to nowhere"" were the first real travel option for months - and the initial trips all sold out in no time. Returning guests were beaming with praise and enthusiasm, both about the cruise experience and the safety protocols. After all, in the early days of the pandemic, cruise ships had been hotbeds for the virus, sometimes stranded for weeks at sea with those on board not allowed to get off. But Singapore has had only a handful cases over the past few months and people put a lot of trust in the authorities' stringent contact tracing. The Covid case on the Quantum of the Seas will put that trust to the test and cruise operators once again are facing a very uncertain future.

Seven things that will change in January,"From 1 January, the free movement of people and goods and services between the UK and the EU will end. This means significant differences to how people live, work and travel. Here are some of the most important things that are changing. From January, UK nationals will only be able to travel without a visa toSchengen area countries,externalfor up to 90 days in any 180-day period (this includes most EU nations and Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and Liechtenstein). In addition, you will need to: Have at least six months left on your passport, except for trips to Ireland. Have travel insurance with health cover. Your current EHIC cardwill be valid until its expiry dateand will be replaced by a new scheme in the future, but the government still advises you to get travel insurance with health cover. Make sure you've checked roaming charges with your mobile provider, as theguarantee of free roaming will end. Have obtained an animal health certificate from your vet at least 10 days before you travel -if you are travelling with your pet- including from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. The current EU pet passport scheme will no longer apply. Use separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens at border control. Significantly, because of the Covid pandemic, travellers from non-EU countries - including the UK - will not be able to visit the EU at the moment, except for a certain number of essential reasons. When the UK was an EU member, you were allowed to bring unlimited amounts of alcohol and tobacco back from an EU country without paying any duty at the border, as long as duty had been paid in the country where you bought it and you could prove it was for your own use. From 2021, duty-free shopping will be available if you travel to the EU, although there will now be limits to the amount you can bring in duty-free from the EU, as there are for arrivals from non-EU countries. The permitted amount of duty-free tobacco and alcoholwill increase,externalhowever. So you will be able, for example, to bring 18 litres of still wine and 42 litres of beer. If you're already living in an EU country, you will have certain protections under thewithdrawal agreement.,external But even then, you shouldcheck that country's specific rules.,externalYou may need to register or apply for residency, get new documents, or meet specific requirements - like having a job. For example, UK nationalsliving in France,externalwill need to obtain new residents' permits. If you plan to move to the EU in 2021, you willno longer have an automatic rightto live, work, study or retire there. You will need a visa if you are going there for any reason other than tourism. The rules will depend on the country you want to move to, and the reason for your move. You shouldcheck the rules,externalfor the country that you are intending to move to. People planning tomove to Ireland,externalwill be largely unaffected. If you're an EU citizen living in the UK by 31 December 2020 - or from Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway or Switzerland - your rights remain the same until 30 June 2021. But you shouldcheck if you can stay,externalafter that. If you have ""indefinite leave to remain"" or ""indefinite leave to enter"" the UK there's no need for you to do anything. If you don't, you'll need to apply for theEU Settlement Scheme,externalor become aUK citizen,externalif you qualify. Again, because of theCommon Travel Area,,externalrights of Irish citizens will not change. From January, there'll be a newpoints-based system,externalfor foreign citizens (except Irish nationals) wanting to move to the UK. The government says it'll treat EU and non-EU citizens equally and will aim to attract people who can contribute to the UK economy. People wanting to move to the UK to work, live or study will have to apply and pay for a visa. It will costÂ£348 to apply for a student visa from outside the UK,external, or Â£475 to extend or switch one from inside the UK. Applying for a visa as a skilled workerwill cost between Â£610 and Â£1,408 per person,external- unless an individual has skills the country is short of. People applying for visas will also have to pay a health surcharge of Â£624 per person per year, unless they are healthcare workers. How will the UK points-based immigration system work? The UK and the EU have agreed there'll be no taxes on each other's goods when they cross borders and no limits on the amount of things that can be traded. However, traders in England, Wales and Scotland (for the case of Northern Ireland, see below) will need to make customs declarations as if they were dealing with countries elsewhere in the world - this means a lot of paperwork. Some products, including plants, live animals and some foods, will also needspecial licences and certificates,external. Others will have to be labelled in specific ways. There will no longer be automatic recognition of professional qualifications - people will need to check each country's rules to make sure their qualifications are still recognised. And while the UK government has chosen to delay - by six months - the imposition of full controls, the EU will be carrying out checks from 1 January. Even though trade with the EU will become trickier,the UK is free to negotiate its own trade deals with other countries, like the US. Brexit supporters say this will benefit the economy in the long run, although critics say it's more important to remain close to the EU. A quick guide to what's in the Brexit deal The UK and EU have agreed to keep an all-but-invisible border, without checkpoints, between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland (which remains in the EU). Northern Ireland will continue to follow many of the EU's rules, meaning that lorries can continue to drive across the border without having to be inspected. However, some new checks will be needed on certain goods arriving into Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK (England, Scotland and Wales) instead. Food products - such as meat, fish and eggs - will need to be checked to ensure they comply with EU standards. However, in order to reduce any potential disruption,supermarkets will be given an initial three-month ""grace period""where the rules will not be enforced on the food they bring into Northern Ireland. Certain meat products will have a longer, six-month grace period. What happens after this period is unclear and will be the subject of future negotiations. An agreement has also been reached to eliminate tariffs - extra charges on goods - for most trade between Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) and Northern Ireland. Some new paperwork will nevertheless be required from 1 January and businesses will need be ready for the changes. What will happen in Northern Ireland after Brexit?

PM to fly to Brussels for last ditch Brexit talks,"Phone calls between Mr Johnson and Ursula von der Leyen have so far failed to find a way through Boris Johnson will fly to Brussels later for talks on a post-Brexit deal with the European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. Time is running out to reach a deal before 31 December, when the UK stops following EU trading rules. The pair will hold talks over dinner, after negotiations between officials ended in deadlock. Major disagreements remain on fishing rights, business competition rules and how a deal will be policed. At the dinner, expected to begin at 19:00 GMT, the prime minister will work through a list of the major sticking points with Mrs von der Leyen, who is representing the leaders of the 27 EU nations. A UK government source said progress at a political level may allow the negotiations - between the UK's Lord Frost and EU's Michel Barnier - to resume over the coming days. But the source added that it was important to be ""realistic"" that an agreement might not be possible. Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Johnson said ""a good deal is still there to be done"", but stressed that the EU's position was to have an ""automatic right to punish us"" if the UK's rules and regulations didn't move in step with the EU in the future. Meanwhile German Chancellor Angela Merkel has said a Brexit deal was still possible but insisted that the integrity of the EU single market must be respected. Kuenssberg analysis: Will Brexit dinner prove to be the last supper? What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? What happens if there's no trade deal? EU sources told the BBC that Mr Barnier briefed the bloc's Europe ministers that talks were tilting towards no deal being reached before the deadline. This video can not be played A deal with the EU can't come ""at any price,"" says Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg says that the purpose of the dinner is not to call a halt or to proclaim that a deal's been done. ""The reason for the meeting is to see if both sides are willing in principle to tolerate the notion of budging, after the negotiations, and frankly negotiators, have been exhausted,"" she says. EU leaders are due to meet for a summit of their own on Thursday. It comes as no surprise at all that EU-UK talks have gone down to the wire. That was widely predicted. As was the ""both making last-minute political compromises"" part, believed to come right at the end, after the two sides abandon their high-stakes game of chicken. But tonight's dinner is far more complex than the prime minister declaring ""OK, Ursula, we'll give you your level playing field, if you (EU) give us our fish."" The clash of ideologies, clear from the start, is still very much present. We have the government's determination to protect its post-Brexit sovereignty, and not sign up to another Brussels rule book on the one side and on the other, the EU focus on protecting its single market a) from what it views as potentially unfair competition from the UK and b) in terms of global reputation. Brussels believes compromising single market rules for a UK deal, would weaken it in the eyes of other future trade partners. Conclusion: As much as Boris Johnson and Ursula von der Leyen, say they still hope for a deal, 'no deal' is still very much on the table tonight, alongside dinner. In separate talks on Tuesday, the UK and EUreached an agreementon specific trade arrangements for Northern Ireland - including on post-Brexit border checks and trading rules for NI, and how the new Irish Sea border will work. It means the UK has now dropped plans to override sections of its EU exit agreement signed last year, which would have potentially broken international law. UK to drop US goods tariffs in bid for trade deal UK and EU reach deal over NI border checks Details of the NI agreement have not yet been published, but Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove is making a statement in the Commons on Wednesday. The agreement was an important moment for businesses, said BBC Northern Ireland political reporter Jayne McCormack. ""But some firms and political parties may be less receptive when they see the finer details of what's been decided,"" she said. Brexit happened but rules didn't change at once:The UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020, but leaders needed time to negotiate a deal for life afterwards - they got 11 months. Talks are happening:The UK and the EU have until 31 December 2020 to agree a trade deal as well as other things, such as fishing rights. If there is no deal:Border checks and taxes will be introduced for goods travelling between the UK and the EU. But deal or no deal, we will still see changes. What happens next with Brexit? Speaking to the BBC, Mr Gove confirmed that EU officials would be present in Northern Ireland ""to make sure the processes, that we are in control of, will be running appropriately"". Former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith said there would be a need ""for some explanation"" from the government because MPs had been ""assured by the government that there were would be no customs officials sitting around"". The UK and EU are at loggerheads over the so-called ""level playing field"" - a set of shared rules and standards to ensure businesses in one country do not have an unfair advantage over their competitors in others. Brussels wants the UK to follow EU rules closely in areas such as workers' rights and environmental regulations, but the UK says the goal of Brexit is to break free from following common rules and reassert national sovereignty. And the two sides disagree on how any future trading disputes should be resolved. On fishing, the two sides continue to haggle over how much access European fishing boats should have to British waters, and how much they would be allowed to catch from next year.

First person receives Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine,"This video can not be played Margaret Keenan was given the vaccine by May Parsons, at University Hospital in Coventry A UK grandmother has become the first person in the world to be given the Pfizer Covid-19 jab as part of a mass vaccination programme. Margaret Keenan, who turns 91 next week, said the injection she received at 06:31 GMT was the ""best early birthday present"". It was the first of 800,000 doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine that will be dispensed in the coming weeks. Up to four million more are expected by the end of the month. Hubs in the UK are starting the rollout by vaccinating the over-80s and some health and care staff. Senior NHS sources told the BBC ""thousands of vaccinations"" had taken place across the UK on Tuesday. 'Hopefully next year we'll be living a normal life' 'Mix-and-match' Covid vaccines to be tested 'V-day' as first people have Covid jab Dubbing the day ""V-day"", Health Secretary Matt Hancock said it was ""a tribute to scientific endeavour and human ingenuity and to the hard work of so many people. ""Today marks the start of the fightback against our common enemy, the coronavirus,"" he said. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, on a visit to a London hospital to see some of the first people getting the jab, said getting vaccinated was ""good for you and good for the whole country"". Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: ""Today we should all allow ourselves a smile - but we must not drop our guard."" On Tuesday, the UK government reported a further 616 people had died within 28 days of a positive test, taking the total, by that measure, to 62,033. A further 12,282 people tested positive for the virus. This video can not be played How the vaccine rollout unfolded â and how a certain William Shakespeare was involved At University Hospital, Coventry, matron May Parsons administered the very first injection to Ms Keenan. ""I feel so privileged to be the first person vaccinated against Covid-19,"" said Ms Keenan, who is originally from Enniskillen, Co Fermanagh. ""It's the best early birthday present I could wish for because it means I can finally look forward to spending time with my family and friends in the new year, after being on my own for most of the year. ""My advice to anyone offered the vaccine is to take it. If I can have it at 90, then you can have it too,"" she added. Scotland's toughest Covid restrictions to be eased Covid deaths 'above worst case scenario' in Wales Further Covid-19 restrictions in NI 'not ruled out' Prof Stephen Powis, national medical director of NHS England, who witnessed the ""historic moment"", said: ""We couldn't hug her but we could clap, and everybody did so in the room."" An emotional Sister Joanna Sloan said she had been looking forward to the vaccine for so long Throughout the day, patients and health workers at some 50 hospitals around the UK have been getting the jab: Sister Joanna Sloan, who will head up the vaccine rollout in Belfast,received the first vaccine administered in Northern Ireland, just after 08:00 GMT at the Royal Victoria Hospital In Wales, a nervousCraig Atkins, 48, from Ebbw Vale, became the first person to get the jab. It was ""scary"" but he could smile now, the care home worker said Consultant anaesthetist Dr Katie Stewart was among the first people in Scotland to get the jab, saying there was something to celebrate after ""a very long hard year"" looking after Covid patients and staying apart to protect each other The UK is the first country in the world to start using the Pfizer vaccine afterregulators approved its use last week. On Tuesday,US regulators confirmed the vaccine is 95% effective, paving the way for it to be approved for emergency use. The Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine has alsobeen found to be ""safe and effective"", according to a paper published on Tuesday and assessed by independent scientists. This video can not be played Matt Hancock says he is thrilled but warns that people must still stick to the rules Speaking in the Commons, the health secretary stressed people did not need to apply for the vaccine. He said the NHS would be in touch with those eligible and urged them to ""please step forward for your country"". Mr Hancock went on to warn that there was ""still a long march ahead"", saying there were ""worrying signs"" of the virus growing in Essex, London and Kent. What are the safety checks for vaccines? Who will get the Covid vaccine first? NHS staff: 'Vaccine is a game changer' New data released by national statisticians for the week ending 27 November showed that of the 14,106 deaths registered in the UK, nearly 3,400 involved Covid. This is 20% higher than the five-year average but similar to the percentages seen in the past two weeks. NHS England chief executive Sir Simon Stevens called the first vaccinations ""remarkable achievement"", but cautioned it was a ""first step"" and ""incredibly important"" people continued to act sensibly. This video can not be played Boris Johnson: 'It will gradually make a huge, huge difference... but we haven't defeated this virus yet"" On a visit to London's Guy's Hospital, the prime minister spoke to 81-year-old Lyn Wheeler, who was the first to receive the vaccine there. ""It is really very moving to hear her say she is doing it for Britain, which is exactly right - she is protecting herself, but also helping to protect the entire country,"" Mr Johnson said. Earlier, he thanked the NHS, volunteers and ""all of the scientists who worked so hard to develop this vaccine"". Labour's shadow health secretary Jon Ashworth said it was ""absolutely fabulous"" to see people getting the vaccine and thanked everyone involved in making it happen. Some800,000 doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine have been secured by the governmentto be administered in the coming weeks - although vaccination is not compulsory. Orders have been placed for 40 million in total - enough for 20 million people, as two courses are needed. However, most supplies are not expected to become available until next year. Mr Hancock said he expected it to take ""several weeks"" to get the first group of health workers, care staff and over-80s vaccinated. This is a momentous day, but make no mistake the NHS faces a huge task in rolling out this vaccine. First, there needs to be a smooth supply - and already there are reports of manufacturing problems, which means the UK is expecting less than half of the 10 million doses of the Pfizer jab it was planning for by the end of the year. The fact it needs to be kept in ultra-cold storage and in batches of 975 units is an added complication that has meant it cannot yet be taken into care homes to vaccinate residents - the very highest priority group - or sent out to GPs to run vaccination clinics in the community. NHS bosses hope to receive guidance from the regulator next week on how to get around this. But these factors illustrate why the UK is still pinning its hopes on a second vaccine developed by Oxford University. That one can be kept in fridges and so is easier to distribute, is British-made and - what is more - there is an ever-growing stockpile ready to use. If that vaccine gets the green light from regulators, there will be a genuine hope the first few months of 2021 will see rapid progress in offering jabs to the most vulnerable people, so the UK can return to something closer to normality.

"England schools can shut for Christmas a day earlyTo give teachers ""a break"" from identifying potential Covid-19 cases, schools can have an inset day.","Schools in England will be allowed to close a day early for Christmas to give teachers ""a proper break"" from identifying potential Covid-19 cases. Schools minister Nick Gibb told MPs that schools could schedule an inset day next Friday to allow ""six clear days"" before Christmas Eve. He said this would ensure teachers and heads do not have to engage with ""track and trace issues"" throughout the break. Teachers unions have been calling for flexibility over school term dates. Last month, the government had told schools in England not to change their Christmas holidays or close early this termin its Covid-19 Winter Plan.,external Government resists calls to shut England's schools What's happening with next year's exams? Speaking to a virtual education select committee, Mr Gibb said: ""We are about to announce that inset days can be used on Friday December 18, even if an inset day had not been originally scheduled for that day. ""We want there to be a clear six days so that, by the time we reach Christmas Eve, staff can have a proper break without having to engage in the track and trace issues."" Inset days - or in-service training days - mean teachers will be in schools for professional development but pupils will be absent. Unions have been asking for the government to give schools the flexibility to switch to remote learning for the final few days of term and reduce the risk of pupils and staff having to self-isolate over Christmas. Mr Gibb said that the government wanted schools to stay open until the end of term as it was the ""best place for young people for their education"", development and for their mental health. But he added: ""We want to make sure that they (school staff) can have a proper break over Christmas. We know they've been under huge stress. ""I don't think some of these senior leadership teams of schools have had a break at all since the pandemic began."" Schools will be allowed to finish term on Thursday next week, but there may be one less scheduled inset day in 2021 if they decide to do this, Mr Gibb added. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), described the announcement of an inset day as a ""small concession"", saying they had hoped for ""more flexibility than has been granted"". ""A single day is better than nothing, but it still means that school and college leaders will have to continue contact tracing in the event of positive cases through to Wednesday December 23,"" he said. ""It also leaves them responsible, at very short notice, for informing families that they will need to self-isolate over the Christmas period."" He added that it was ""frustrating"" the government had taken so long to agree the decision as there was ""so little time left for schools to make the necessary arrangements"". Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the NAHT school leaders' union, said the move could still be ""insufficient"" to meet the needs of some families and schools. He added: ""A chaotic and disruptive end of term is still possible, especially in areas where there are large numbers of Covid cases and high levels of staff and pupil absence already.""

Covid case cuts short Singapore 'cruise to nowhere'The ship returned to port early after a passenger tested positive for coronavirus.Asia,"The coronavirus pandemic has largely shut down the cruise industry A Royal Caribbean ship has returned to Singapore on day three of a four-day ""cruise to nowhere"" after a passenger tested positive for Covid-19. The city state's ""cruises to nowhere"" - starting and ending at the same port without stops - launched last month. They are an attempt to revive the hard-hit cruise industry, which largely came to a global standstill after ships saw  large outbreaks early in the pandemic. Singapore's special cruises are only open to its residents. The Royal Caribbean cruise ship Quantum of the Seas left Singapore on Monday for a four-day round trip as part of a ""safe cruising"" scheme announced by the country's tourism board in October. The cruise company said it had turned the ship around after one guest tested positive for coronavirus after checking in with the on-board medical team. Are cruise ships really 'floating Petri dishes'? The 'last cruise ship on Earth' finally comes home ""We identified and isolated all guests and crew who had close contact with this guest, and each of those individuals have subsequently tested negative for the virus,"" it said in a statement. The firm added that passengers would be allowed to disembark ""after a review of contact tracing is completed"". According to Singaporean daily newspaper The Straits Times, there were 1,680 guests and 1,448 crew members on board. The passenger who tested positive for Covid-19 was an 83-year-old Singaporean who first reported to the ship's medical centre with diarrhoea and underwent a coronavirus test as part of on-board protocols, it added. A raft of safety measures were introduced for passengers on the special cruises to nowhere, including Covid-19 tests before boarding and after disembarking. The ships were also running at half their usual capacity for safe distancing purposes. The first 'cruise to nowhere' launched on another ship in November with stringent safety checks ""That we were able to quickly identify this single case and take immediate action is a sign that the system is working as it was designed to do,"" said the Royal Caribbean. Late on Wednesday morning, a Reddit user, who said they were quarantined on the ship, posted that passengers were ""not cleared to disembark yet"". The user had first posted on the social media platform at 02:42 local time (18:43 GMT) to say the captain had just announced the cruise would be cut short due to the Covid-19 case. The cruise industry was hit hard early in the pandemic, whenthe virus first swept the Diamond Princess in Japanand thenthe Grand Princess in the US, resulting in passengers being quarantined at sea after hundreds contracted the virus onboard. Royal Caribbean has said another cruise scheduled to depart on Thursday will go ahead, local media reported. By Andreas Illmer, BBC News, Singapore Singaporeans are desperate to get off their little island. For months, the border has been effectively closed and the thirst for travel has taken bizarre forms like eating airline food on a plane parked on the tarmac or booking staycations at the airport. An eagerly awaited travel bubble with Hong Kong was delayed because of rising cases there. So the ""cruises to nowhere"" were the first real travel option for months - and the initial trips all sold out in no time. Returning guests were beaming with praise and enthusiasm, both about the cruise experience and the safety protocols. After all, in the early days of the pandemic, cruise ships had been hotbeds for the virus, sometimes stranded for weeks at sea with those on board not allowed to get off. But Singapore has had only a handful cases over the past few months and people put a lot of trust in the authorities' stringent contact tracing. The Covid case on the Quantum of the Seas will put that trust to the test and cruise operators once again are facing a very uncertain future.

PM heads to Brussels on Wednesday for Brexit talks,"Boris Johnson is heading to Brussels on Wednesday for talks with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on a post-Brexit trade deal. The pair are under pressure to get an agreement before the UK stops following EU trading rules on 31 December. The dinner meeting comes after intensive talks between EU and UK officials ended in deadlock. Major disagreements remain on fishing rights, business competition rules and how a deal will be policed. Mr Johnson will work through a list of the major sticking points with Mrs von der Leyen, who is representing the leaders of the 27 EU nations. UK and EU reach deal over NI border checks What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? What happens if there's no trade deal? He will take part in Prime Minister's Questions before travelling to the Belgian capital. EU leaders are due to meet for a summit of their own on Thursday. A UK government source said ""political impetus"" would be required if the talks are to make any more progress. ""If we can make progress at a political level, it may allow Lord Frost and his team to resume negotiations over the coming days,"" the source added. EU sources told the BBC that EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier briefed the bloc's Europe ministers that talks were tilting towards no deal being reached before the deadline. The purpose of Wednesday's dinner is not to call a halt to talks. But nor is the purpose to proclaim that a deal's been done. The reason for the meeting is to see if both sides are willing in principle to tolerate the notion of budging, after the negotiations, and frankly negotiators, have been exhausted. If the prime minister and Mrs von der Leyen can look each other in the eye and agree that there are still compromises to be had, then a deal is still possible. If they are willing to make that kind of pact - to say privately to each other, I'm willing to budge if you are too - then that would in theory allow technical talks to get going again. Read more from Laura Earlier, Mr Johnson said he hoped the ""power of sweet reason"" will allow both sides to clinch an agreement before the end of the year. If an agreement is not reached and ratified by this date, the UK and EU could introduce import charges on each other's goods. Brexit happened but rules didn't change at once:The UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020, but leaders needed time to negotiate a deal for life afterwards - they got 11 months. Talks are happening:The UK and the EU have until 31 December 2020 to agree a trade deal as well as other things, such as fishing rights. If there is no deal:Border checks and taxes will be introduced for goods travelling between the UK and the EU. But deal or no deal, we will still see changes. What happens next with Brexit? News of Wednesday's meeting comes as the UK announced it hadreached agreement with the EUon post-Brexit border checks and trading rules for Northern Ireland. It means UK has now dropped plans to override sections of its EU exit agreement it signed last year, which would have potentially broken international law. The government had previously said it needed the powers as a ""safety net"" to prevent a ""border down the Irish Sea"" in case talks with the EU over the border broke down. The agreement, the details of which have yet to be made public, follows talks in Brussels between Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove and EU commissioner MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ, which have taken place alongside the negotiations over a new trade agreement. Speaking after the announcement, Mr Gove said he was ""delighted"" and thanked the EU team for their ""constructive and pragmatic approach"". Mr Å efÄoviÄ said the agreement had removed ""one big obstacle"" from the trade talks, and would create ""positive momentum"" for the negotiators. But he warned the two negotiating teams were ""still very far apart, and we are not hiding this from anyone"". The two sides are at loggerheads over the so-called ""level playing field"" - a set of shared rules and standards to ensure businesses in one country do not have an unfair advantage over their competitors in others. Brussels wants the UK to follow EU rules closely in areas such as workers' rights and environmental regulations, but the UK says the goal of Brexit is to break free from following common rules and reassert national sovereignty. And the two sides disagree on how any future trading disputes should be resolved. On fishing, the two sides are continuing to haggle over how much access European fishing boats should have to British waters, and how much they would be allowed to catch from next year.

Higher exams to be cancelled for Scottish pupilsThe country's education secretary says the decision was based on the disruption Covid has caused for many pupils.Scotland politics,"This video can not be played Swinney: 'No Higher or Advanced Higher exams in 2021 Next year's Higher and Advanced Highers exams are to be cancelled in Scottish schools, it has been confirmed. Education Secretary John Swinney said the decision was based on the disruption that Covid has caused to the education system rather than safety concerns. The move means that pupils' final grades will be based on the judgement of their teachers. The country's National 5 exams have already been cancelled. There were more than 200,000 entries for Higher and Advanced Higher courses this year. The Scottish government had previously said a final decision on whether the exams would go ahead would not be taken until the middle of February. Scottish National 5 exams to be cancelled in 2021 Scottish school pupils have results upgraded School pupils join protests over SQA exam results But teaching unions had warned that timescale would be too late, with the EIS calling last week for an early decision to be made to cancel the exams and switch to an alternative assessment model. Mr Swinney told the Scottish Parliament that many pupils had already lost ""significant learning time"" through having to self-isolate in addition to the teaching time they lost before the summer holidays. And he said the level of disruption had not been equal - with pupils from the poorest backgrounds the most likely to have been affected. S6 pupil Carly said some of her friends have had to isolate two or three times Mr Swinney added: ""I am therefore announcing today that there will be no Higher or Advanced Higher exams in 2021. ""Instead we will adopt the new model that has been developed and base awards on teacher judgement of evidence of learner attainment. ""This is safe, it is fair, and it better recognises the reality of the disruption so many pupils have already had to their learning"". Mr Swinney also stressed that there would be no algorithms used to adjust the estimated grades put forward by teachers aftercontroversy about their use in deciding this year's results. Some pupils have told BBC Scotland that they were relieved the exams had been cancelled. They included Carly, an S6 pupil at Govan High School in Glasgow, who is studying Advanced Higher History, Higher Modern Studies and Higher Care and is hoping to do nursing at university. She said: ""It's been hard learning this year. I've had to isolate once but some of my friends have had to isolate two or three times. ""I feel relieved that exams are cancelled and can make sure that I am getting everything done that I need to and not just working towards something that's not going to happen."" Protests were held over this year's exams after some pupils had their results downgraded by the Scottish Qualifications Authority This year's exams were also cancelled due to the pandemic and lockdown, with the results initially decided using teacher estimated grades which the Scottish Qualifications Authority then moderated based on the past performance of different schools. There was an outcry and protests took place after it emerged that 125,000 of those teacher estimates were downgraded, with claims the system was unfair to children at schools with worse records in exams. The Scottish government then agreed to accept just the teacher estimates. Opposition parties have regularly accused the education secretary of ""dithering"" over key decisions, which they said had left pupils, staff and parents in the dark. Opposition parties have accused Mr Swinney of ""dithering"" over whether the exams should be held Scottish Conservative education spokesman Jamie Greene said Mr Swinney had failed to show leadership throughout the pandemic. He added: ""First it was the exams fiasco, then it was throwing the towel in over National 5 exams, and now he has dithered and delayed over Higher and Advanced Higher exams. ""By his own admission, the education secretary now accepts that it is our poorest students who have been deprived of their education this year. ""No wonder beleaguered teachers are writing in their droves to confirm they have completely lost confidence in John Swinney's abilities."" Parents group UsForThem Scotland said the ""inexcusably bad"" decision would have a ""terrible impact on childrens' futures"". The group's Jo Bisset said: ""The fact the Scottish government couldn't get its act together and run an exams diet tells you exactly how seriously the system takes children's interests in the short, medium and long term."" The announcement was welcomed by the EIS, Scotland's biggest teaching union, which described it as a ""common-sense decision that is in the best interests of students."" But the union also warned that agreement needed to be reached on the ""additional workload"" that would be created for teachers by the alternative assessment programme. Wales has cancelled all GCSE and A-level exams in 2021. Welsh Education Minister Kirsty Williams said it was impossible to guarantee a level playing field for pupils due to the Covid pandemic. Grades will be decided using classroom assessments. In England, A-levels and GCSEs are due to go ahead next summer, starting three weeks later than usual. Plans for how to manage them in a pandemic are expected to be published later this week. Northern Ireland is planning to hold all exams in 2021, with its education minister, Peter Weir, saying they represented the ""fairest way of judging students"". The decision to cancel Highers and Advanced Higher exams is not straightforward. There are, of course, questions over the best way to ensure fairness towards students whose learning has been badly disrupted The original plan was to delay Highers and Advanced Highers by a few weeks and give a greater choice of questions. The hope was this would make up for any disruption. Many students have faced disruption. But could this disruption all have been anticipated when the original plan was announced two months ago? One challenge now is to ensure the system for awarding grades is seen as credible and robust. Nobody wants the real achievements of candidates questioned in future years because they didn't sit exams. It is also worth noting that most  new university students this year will not have sat exams since their National 5s in fourth year - and some may not have sat any at all.

However, pregnant women can have the RSV vaccine at the same time as the Covid jab. What are the symptoms of the new XEC Covid variant and is it spreading in the UK? Vaccines from two companies are currently in use across the UK: Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna. People are advised to take whichever vaccine they are offered, as both provide protection against severe illness or death. AstraZenecapulled its Covid vaccine worldwidebecause of the surplus of updated vaccines from its competitors. At the firm's request, in May 2024, the European Medicines Authoritywithdrew authorisation for the vaccine,,externalwhich is no longer being manufactured or supplied. Covid vaccine safety - What we know NHS England: About the Covid vaccination,external A number of High Street chemists and private clinics sell and administer the Pfizer Covid vaccine directly to the public. The cost varies from about Â£45 to Â£99. You need to be aged 12 or above, and must not have had a Covid vaccine in the previous three months. You also need to talk to a health professional to check that it is suitable. A protein-based booster vaccine made by Novavax, which works differently to the Pfizer and Moderna jabs, is also available. Moderna is hoping to launch a combinedflu and Covid vaccinein 2025 or 2026, afterthe jab passed a vital part of final-stage scientific checksin June 2024. Pfizer and BioNTech are testing a similar two-in-one mRNA vaccine against flu and Covid.

But there is no need to wait if you have recently recovered from Covid and feel well. The vaccines do not infect people with Covid, and cannot cause positive test results. What to do if you have Covid Is Covid now just a regular winter bug? For most people,side effects are mild,external. Themost common include a sore arm, headache, chills, fatigue and nausea.

How do I know the Covid vaccine is safe?How does the Pfizer vaccine work?,"More than 60% of the world's population - 4.8 billion people - have received at least one dose of coronavirus vaccine. There are different approved types and brands available and all have undergone rigorous testing and safety checks. Safety trials begin in the lab, with tests and research on cells and animals, before moving on to human studies. The principle is to start small and only move to the next stage of testing if there are no outstanding safety concerns. When will I get a coronavirus vaccine? If the safety data from the labs is good, scientists can check the vaccine or treatment is effective. That means tests on large numbers of volunteers - about 40,000 in the case of Pfizer-BioNTech,the first to be approved in the UK. Half are given the vaccine and the other half a placebo jab. The researchers and participants are not told which group is which, until after the results, to avoid bias. This video can not be played BBC's Laura Foster explains the order in which the Covid vaccine will be given All of the work and findings are checked and verified independently. The Covid vaccine trials happened at breakneck speed, but they didn't skip any steps - they were able to move faster because so many people were involved and other projects were put aside. Approval is only given if regulators are happy that a vaccine is safe and effective. Checks continue after approval to make sure there are no further side effects or long-term risks. In the UK, independent experts on the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation decide how best to use a vaccine and who should get it after approval by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency. Scientists hope to tweak coronavirus vaccines to ensure they continue to offer high protection as new variants of the disease emerge. The UK's drug regulator says new vaccines can befast-tracked for approvalif needed. No corners will be cut, with safety paramount. But lengthy clinical trials with thousands of volunteers will not be needed. Instead, data from existing studies and ongoing real-world use could be used. Pfizer-BioNTech's vaccine (and Moderna's) uses bits of genetic code to cause an immune response. These are called mRNA vaccines. They do not alter human cells, but merely present the body with instructions to build immunity to Covid. The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine uses a harmless virus altered to look a lot more like the pandemic virus. Vaccines sometimes contain other ingredients, like aluminium, that make the vaccine stable or more effective. Vaccines do not give you a disease. Instead, they teach your body's immune system to recognise and fight the infection they have been designed to protect against. Some people do experience mild to moderate symptoms after being vaccinated. This is not the disease itself, but the body's response to the vaccine. Common reactions,externalthat may affect more than one in 10 people and typically get better within days include chills, tiredness and aching muscles. It is rare to find that health problems occurring following a vaccine are actually caused by the vaccine itself. Events may be coincidental and unrelated to vaccination. The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine has beenlinked to very rare cases of blood clots,external. This is not proof that the vaccine is to blame. Covid infection itself can also make clots more likely and they can occur naturally too. The chance of this happening to an individual is still extremely low, but as a precaution, younger age groups in the UK have been offered alternative Covid vaccines. Allergic reactions to vaccines are rare. For any approved vaccine, the ingredients arelisted.,external There have been serious but treatable allergic reactions in a very small number of people given the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. As a precaution, the MHRA says people with a history of significant allergic reactions to any of the ingredients in this vaccine should not currently have this jab. Be aware that anti-vaccine stories are spread online through social media. These posts are not based on scientific advice (or blend facts with misinformation). People will still be offered the jab even if they have had Covid in the past. That's because natural immunity may not be long-lived and immunisation could offer more protection. Guidance,externalsays there are no safety concerns about giving jabs to people with ""long"" Covid either. But people who are currently unwell with Covid-19 should not receive the vaccine until they have recovered. Some vaccines, such as the shingles vaccine and the children's nasal flu vaccine, can contain pork gelatine. The Covid vaccines from Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca do not contain this, or any other animal products. TheBritish Islamic Medical Association,externalsays there is negligible alcohol in it - no more than in bread, for example. How will the vulnerable be protected from Covid?

"Biden vows 100m vaccinations in first 100 daysThe US President-elect says he can't promise to end Covid quickly, but he can change its course.US & Canada","This video can not be played ""Masking, vaccinations, opening schools"": Joe Biden's key goals for his first 100 days US President-elect Joe Biden has set a goal of 100 million Covid vaccinations in his first 100 days in office. He said his first months in office would not end the outbreak and gave few details on a rollout plan but he said he would change the course of Covid-19. Introducing his health team for when he takes office on 20 January, he urged Americans to ""mask up for 100 days"". On Tuesday, a report paved the way for a Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine to be approved and rolled out for Americans. Emergency authorisation for its use could be issued by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Thursday, with the country's top infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci sayingmass vaccination could start as soon as next week. Also on Tuesday, President Donald Trump attended a summit at the White House of his Covid-19 vaccination programme, Operation Warp Speed, and hailed the expected approval of vaccines. His administration hopes to vaccinate as many as 24 million people by mid-January. The US has recorded more than 15 million cases so far and 285,000 deaths,according to Johns Hopkins University research,external, both global highs. Many parts of the country are seeing peak infections, with record numbers of people in hospital, with some experts blaming travel by millions over the recent Thanksgiving holiday. Safety data on Pfizer jab released by US How many doses will be given to each US state Where has been hit hardest? At a news conference on Tuesday, Mr Biden laid out how he plans to address the pandemic in his first 100 days in office. That period is traditionally seen as a benchmark for new presidents to make their mark with new policies and ideas. He vowed to get ""at least 100 million Covid vaccine shots into the arms of the American people"". ""My first 100 days won't end the Covid-19 virus. I can't promise that. But we did not get into this mess quickly. We're not going to get out of it quickly,"" he said at the event in Delaware, giving few details of how the largest vaccination programme in US history would be carried out. This video can not be played One travel nurse's journey to US Covid hotspots Last week, Mr Biden complained he had been given no rollout plans by the Trump administration. Operation Warp Speed's top scientist Moncef Slaoui has still to meet the Biden team and is expected to do so this week. Getting children back to school would also be a priority, the president-elect said. Mr Biden also introduced California Attorney General Xavier Becerra as his nomination for health secretary and his choice of Rochelle Walensky as head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Among his other aides will be Dr Anthony Fauci as chief Covid medical adviser. The expert also advised the Trump team and often fell foul of the president for his views. Getting 100 million vaccines to Americans in just over three months is not expected to be easy. The large geographical size of the US and the logistics of rolling out a new vaccine could present challenges in achieving the goal. Helen Branswell, senior writer on global health at US-based website Stat News, has described Mr Biden's plan as ""potentially realistic"" if the supplies of the drug are available and Mr Trump successfully begins the vaccination programme before his term ends. ""I think the early part of the vaccine delivery programme is going to be very bumpy in the US so by the time he [Mr Biden] takes office some of those bumps may have been levelled out a bit,"" Ms Branswell told the BBC. This video can not be played Five challenges of distributing a Covid-19 vaccine around the world Dr Fauci suggested the plan was ""bold but doable"", warning ""the road ahead will not be easy"". By comparison, 51.8% of Americans older than six months were vaccinated against flu in 2019-20,according to the CDC,external. The US population is 316 million people, which means that around 158 million people were given flu jabs between July 2019 and May 2020. In the UK, the government says it aims to vaccinate 800,000 people over the next few weeks after it beganthe world's first approved rollout of the vaccine. The event was mainly a celebration of Operation Warp Speed's efforts to get a vaccine to the American people. President Trump said of the expected vaccine approvals: ""They say it's somewhat of a miracle and I think that's true."" He added: ""Every American who wants the vaccine will be able to get the vaccine and we think by spring we're going to be in a position nobody would have believed possible just a few months ago."" This video can not be played Trump: ""Every American who wants the Covid vaccine will get it"" The president also signed an executive order aimed at ensuring that Americans had first priority in receiving doses. But it remains unclear how that will affect contracts that US companies have already signed with other countries. The Trump administration did sign up for an initial 100 million doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine but a member of the Pfizer board said the chance to buy more was turned down a number of times and more doses might not be available until June. The Operation Warp Speed team said its policy was to deal with a number of manufacturers of vaccines. US media reported the executive order reflected concern that supplies might not be enough. On Tuesday, US regulators confirmed the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid vaccine was 95% effective, paving the way for it to be approved for emergency use. The FDA found no safety concerns to stop approval of the vaccine. Although two doses are needed to offer full protection, the first jab prevented 89% of the most severe cases. Some side-effects such as redness or swelling at the injection site, short-term fatigue, headaches and muscle-pain were reported but were considered mild. US biotech firm Moderna has reported similar successes with its vaccine and it is also expected to get FDA approval before Christmas. Estimates of the cost of both vaccines are in-line with the flu jab, which is about $40 (Â£30) per person in the US. Mr Trump's government is taking steps to provide the vaccine at no cost to elderly people and those who receive government assistance for healthcare costs,according to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS).,external Meanwhile, the coalition People's Vaccine Alliance warned thatrich countries were hoarding doses of Covid-19 vaccinesand people living in poor countries were set to miss out.
