I was convinced my baby deserved a better mum,"At the end of maternal mental health awareness week, Alexandra Vanotti details her experience of post-natal anxiety and the help she received - which she describes as a godsend. My sister was on honeymoon in South Africa when my baby boy was born.  It was almost a fortnight before she was due home and I had an overwhelming fear that my baby would die before my sister got a chance to meet him. In my mind, over the coming weeks and months my beautiful baby died a thousand deaths. This, despite his clean bill of health. You may have twigged already that I wasn't well.  It took me a bit longer to realise. I had an uneventful pregnancy, albeit under the care of the high risk team at Chelsea and Westminster hospital in London. At the age of 21, I had undergone heart surgery, but at this stage my heart was fine and it was years since I had seen a cardiologist. During the first trimester, I was the textbook example of a glowing mother-to-be, full of excitement and wonder at the life growing inside me.  But as I approached the 18-week scan, I started feeling anxious. I read a leaflet on the potential health issues that might be picked up at the anomaly scan and I cried tears of terror.  But we passed it with no concern. The baby also passed the foetal heart ultrasound - a necessity with my congenital heart problem.  And yet I couldn't shake off the sense of foreboding. As my due date grew nearer, my focus shifted to childbirth and I was bombarded with unwelcome thoughts of sudden heart failure, a twisted umbilical cord around the baby's neck. Stillbirth. On the surface, though, I was more serene and calm than my family had ever seen. I told nobody of my fears. ""Pack your hospital bag,"" my mother and sister urged,  alarmed that with only one month to go, I'd not made one baby purchase.  My husband dragged me to choose buggies and cots, rather than the other way round.  I was told many times it was wonderful that I was so laid back.  My mind, however, was telling me that my baby would die, so what was the point of buying anything? Our baby boy was born on 22 January, 2014. Strangely, despite the pain of contractions, I was calm and cheerful throughout labour.  When he arrived I was awestruck, spending 12 hours straight just gazing at him in wonder.  He was the most beautiful baby I'd ever seen in my life and I happily told anyone who'd listen.  I was completely besotted and blissfully happy. Above all, I was relieved that despite my fears, he and I had survived childbirth together. It was two days later in hospital that I suddenly felt my stomach clench with fear, as I was hit by a crushing sense of responsibility.  How could I keep my baby safe in this big scary world?  In my mind, the ways in which he could be harmed were infinite.  I would have to be on guard the whole time to make sure nothing happened to him. My nightmare with postnatal anxiety, OCD and insomnia had begun. My primary obsession was that my baby would die in his sleep - therefore, I had to stay awake while he slept.  To be fair, this is a common concern to new parents. Like many new dads, my husband was also on edge and would hover over the sleeping baby to check he was breathing.  But for him, the solution was simple - he bought an under-mattress movement sensor, which would sound an alarm if the baby stopped breathing. My husband slept soundly after this. I, on the other hand, would just be drifting off, only to jolt awake as I felt the need to check, double check, triple check that I'd turned the sensor on.  In my mind, the sensor became the only thing standing between my baby and cot death, so I took it everywhere, even slotting it under the mattress in the pram, switching it on whenever I stopped. Walking down the high street on one of our first excursions out as a family of three, we were overtaken by a little boy on a scooter, his mother close behind.  Instantly a series of intrusive disturbing images flitted through my mind - the scooter veering off the pavement into traffic, the boy hit by a car, a little body lying in the street, the mother screaming hysterically.  My legs turned to jelly and I had to hold onto the buggy to stop myself falling.  The little boy and his mother continued on their way, oblivious. These intrusive images continued, several times a day. Some seemed like reasonable and appropriate fears, such as dropping the baby as I carried him down the stairs, letting go of the buggy and watching it roll into the road in the path of a car.  But others were shocking and strange - accidentally putting the baby in the microwave,  opening our front door to a stranger who'd fling acid at me and the baby, dropping him off the side of a ferry and watching him disappear into the waves below. Torturous little horror films that ran through my mind all day. I felt fearful the whole time, full of adrenalin, the way you feel when you've almost tripped while descending a flight of stairs - racing heart, plummeting stomach, jelly legs.  I was so preoccupied with my anxious thoughts that I was disconnected from everything else. When the baby was not even a week old, my husband, alarmed by my mental state, made an emergency doctor's appointment.  Initially the doctor talked about baby blues and how I might find myself feeling better in a week or so, but my husband put his foot down and demanded a referral for therapy. On the NHS it would be a four-to-six-week wait.  But thanks to our private medical insurance, a week later I was sitting in the waiting room at the Priory in Roehampton waiting for my first psychiatric assessment. a persistent feeling of sadness and low mood no longer enjoying things you used to enjoy lack of energy and feeling tired all the time trouble sleeping at night feeling you're unable to look after your baby problems concentrating and making decisions loss of appetite or an increased appetite (comfort eating) feeling agitated, irritable or very apathetic (you ""can't be bothered"") feelings of guilt, hopelessness and self-blame difficulty bonding with your baby frightening thoughts - for example, about hurting your baby; these can be scary, but they're very rarely acted upon thinking about suicide and self-harm Source:NHS mental health problems and pregnancy,external #maternalmentalhealth, #maternalmentalhealthawareness, #askher The initial assessment involved no therapy, but what seemed like hundreds of questions.  The psychiatrist very quickly ascertained that I was suffering from postnatal anxiety and OCD, and that I would benefit from cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT).  She explained a sliding scale of anxiety, with most people experiencing it to a certain extent.  On her scale I wasn't even near the top, and she reassured me that with therapy I would soon start to feel better.  I nodded numbly, wondering just how bad you had to feel to reach the top of the anxiety scale.  I felt I was living in my own private hell. The following week I left the baby with my mother and arrived at the Priory for my first therapy session with a CBT specialist.  Cognitive behavioural therapy doesn't involve going back over past issues, instead it looks at current problems and, in particular, it identifies your core beliefs.  These are often unrecognised deep-seated beliefs that can affect your life and your behaviour. In our first session, my therapist quickly identified that I felt utterly crushed by the responsibility of keeping the baby safe.  She questioned me gently for almost the whole 90-minute session. Reaching the core belief was like peeling individual layers of an onion, with searching questions that probed deeper and deeper until the fundamental core was revealed. I broke down in tears and shook with emotion as I finally admitted out loud, ""I'm the only person who can keep my baby safe"".  This was my belief - and I hadn't even known it.  Now to work on contesting that belief. I didn't get better immediately.  Not at all. In fact it took nine months of counselling.  I found therapy really hard work and didn't look forward to my weekly sessions.  I would leave them feeling completely wrung out, emotionally exhausted, and sometimes I couldn't understand why my therapist often went - in my opinion - off on a tangent. One week she questioned me on my aspirations as a mother and, after listening to me talk about home-cooked food, a clean and tidy house, losing my baby weight, she suggested gently that I stop striving for perfection, and instead aim for ""good enough"".  I looked at her blankly.  ""What do you mean 'good enough?'  Why would I settle for good enough?  I want to be the best mum possible,"" I said.  She kept pressing.  I kept resisting.  I left that session feeling frustrated.  In my opinion, good enough meant not enough.  And why were we wasting valuable time on this when we should be tackling the ""bully in my head"" as I had come to call my anxiety?  I yearned to be better, back to my old self. Everywhere I went, I saw danger.  It was worse at night.  I could almost feel a tangible sense of impending doom.  I knew I wouldn't get more than three or four hours' sleep - the baby suffered from silent reflux and woke every 45 minutes after midnight.  But even the corners of the room seemed darker and more threatening in the evening. At night, trying to stop myself falling asleep mid-feed, I found even more horrors on the internet.  ""The dog ate my baby's head,"" was one particularly unhelpful headline which had me jumping out of bed at four in the morning, running downstairs to shake my husband awake.  ""He's going to get mauled by a dog,"" I cried.  He looked at me uncomprehending, bleary eyed, but I couldn't be calmed until he got out of bed and helped me compose an email to my parents and sister about the family cockapoos. Another news article about baby seats sent shock waves through my core.  Babies shouldn't be kept in their car seats for longer than two hours, it said.  After reading this, nothing my husband said could convince me to take a car journey longer than half an hour, in case the baby asphyxiated en route. ""I am so anxious,"" I confided tearfully in my mother.  She nodded knowingly and said, ""It never goes away, once you're a parent"".  She didn't realise the extent of my anxiety.  I took her words quite literally to mean that I would feel this horrendous for the rest of my life.  The bully would never go away.  I couldn't possibly survive at that level of anxiety. I thought I had made a mistake, that I was not cut out for motherhood.  And then came guilt for not being thankful for my beautiful child. Ironically I embraced the days when I just felt a dull depression rather than racing anxiety - it was a relief. ""This is normal,"" I told myself. ""All mothers feel this and it will pass."" To say I lost myself that first year is no over-exaggeration.  I don't recognise my face in photos, my false smile.  Delirious and headachy from sleep deprivation, sugar became my crutch and I piled on all the weight I'd lost after giving birth.  I didn't get my hair done for more than six months.  Putting on a pair of earrings was too much effort.  Never mind ""good enough"", I was failing miserably at being an alpha mum and I knew everyone would be able to see through the camouflage of makeup so it wasn't worth the effort.  And I was so very tired, all the time.  I hated what was happening to me, and I imagined that my little boy would one day realise he'd drawn the short straw and reject me.  I felt he deserved better than me. The light bulb moment came a few months in, after the ""good enough"" session.  My therapist helped me finally realise that my quest for perfection was fuelling my anxiety.  My core belief in this instance?  That my self worth was measured by how well I could do things.  Before baby, everything from documents at work, to the way my home was decorated, to sourcing a quirky restaurant for dinner with friends, I had put a huge amount of effort into making it as good as possible.  I prided myself on being super-organised. My school friends had a nickname for me - The Guru.  I never missed a birthday.  I loved doing thoughtful things for my friends and family.  My self worth was completely tied up in being this Guru.  Naturally I had wanted to be the best mother possible.  Before having a baby I had all the time in the world to invest in my pursuit of perfection.  But as most new parents discover, you can't control anything about a baby, and it's natural to feel like your life has been turned upside down. What would happen if I just stopped? I listened to my therapist and reluctantly decided to give it a go, settling for ""good enough"" rather than perfection.  The world didn't stop turning.  The house didn't fall down.  I started being kinder and more forgiving of myself.  I scrapped my epic ""to do"" list.  I stopped frantically cleaning the kitchen and making the house presentable when the baby napped. Instead, I would curl up next to him and nap too.  Or I'd relax with a half-hour treat of daytime TV or trashy magazines (""The trashier the better,"" my therapist encouraged).  I ordered takeaways.  I let the dirty washing pile up and ordered myself not to panic about it. Gradually, life got easier.  It felt almost rebellious and sloppy at first, deliberately turning my back on everything I'd strived towards for such a long time.  But I soon realised that nobody noticed these changes apart from me.  My family and friends didn't love me for the things I did, or how well I did them.  They loved me, to quote Bridget Jones, ""Just the way you are"". It was deliriously freeing.  As I stopped fretting about everything being perfect, I started living in the moment - not dwelling on the past or worrying about the future.  Concentrating on one day at a time, I suddenly realised one day that the scary visions and intrusive thoughts were receding. ""You're wearing earrings,"" exclaimed my therapist one week.  I self-consciously touched my ear and smiled.  Somehow it hadn't seemed like such an effort this morning. Like many people, my life has been touched by tragic and traumatic periods, but my first year of motherhood was undoubtedly the toughest time of my life.   I think it is safe to say that I was traumatised afterwards.  It took a huge toll on my husband, too, watching his wife, his best friend, fall apart before his eyes, turning into someone he didn't recognise. Three years later, we felt ready to try for our second baby and I was lucky to fall pregnant quickly.  I was excited but feared I would fall ill again.  The Chelsea and Westminster midwives were really on the ball, though. As soon as I mentioned my previous history during my first check-up, I was referred to the hospital's perinatal service. I met with psychotherapist Danny once a month or so during my pregnancy.  I talked at length about my past experiences and he quickly saw I had convinced myself that the same thing would happen all over again.  Danny reassured me that I had a good support network and that we could act swiftly if I fell unwell.  I also saw the hospital psychiatrist, who strongly recommended anti-depressants if I started feeling down.  My husband, who previously had quite strong opinions on anti-depressants, was in full agreement that this time I should take them if needed. It started so well.  Our baby's birth was calm and without complications.  Another beautiful little boy.  Bringing him home, I felt our little family was complete, and was elated I'd never have to go through pregnancy again.  For the first two weeks I was on a real high - this is what motherhood was meant to feel like.  But then he started showing signs of reflux - coughing and spluttering during feeds, hugely disrupted sleep, grimacing in pain.  I braced myself for a tough few months but knew that we would survive - after all, we'd done it before with his older brother. A month after the baby arrived, we lost my elderly father-in-law when he suffered a bad fall.  My grieving husband had to organise not just a UK funeral but his father's repatriation to Italy, an enormous task which took up all his time.  I developed mastitis.  The baby failed his hearing test, showing signs of hearing loss.  He wasn't putting on weight (due to his struggles with reflux and breastfeeding).  I was diagnosed with a hernia, which needed surgery - and subsequently developed a dangerous infection which required daily visits to hospital.  Our troubles seemed never-ending. I felt massively overwhelmed when left to look after both boys by myself.  I literally couldn't put the baby down because of his reflux, which meant that showering, getting dressed, even going to the bathroom was an issue.  Getting out of the house with both boys felt like planning a mission to Mars.  ""Don't you feel utterly panicked when you need to be somewhere at a certain time?"" I asked a friend, who was a new mum.  ""Well,"" she said, frowning, ""It's a mammoth task, of course, but I wouldn't say I panic.""  I felt self-conscious for over-sharing.  I was convinced I couldn't cope.  What totally passed me by was that everyone struggles.  Looking after babies is hard work, end of story.  But for some reason, I felt I needed to have a handle on it - my need for control creeping back in. Danny came to visit me several times at home and often carried out my therapy sessions while I nursed the baby.  There was no way I could have managed the journey to the hospital in those early days. Both my babies suffered from digestive problems and would scream in discomfort for hours at a time, and both times I cut out cows milk from my diet. But I became obsessive over everything that passed my lips, convinced I was slowly poisoning my baby through my breast milk. At one point, I considered a total elimination diet, eating only pear and lamb, until my mother talked me out of it. One night, staying at my parents' house while my husband was in Italy, I was delirious with exhaustion after two hours trying to settle my miserable screaming baby.  I thought about putting the baby down, walking out the front door and stepping in front of a bus.  Five minutes later I was tearfully apologising to my son, nuzzling his neck, promising I'd never leave him.  I have never had suicidal thoughts and that moment terrified me into action.  In the morning I told my mother how I'd felt.  And after half an hour of arguing with her - I insisted I could get better by myself - I agreed to start taking anti-depressants.  Within a week, I had stopped crying every day - something I hadn't even realised I'd been doing - and the cloud lifted. A year later, I am still on anti-depressants, and still see Danny and the team from the Chelsea and Westminster perinatal service. They've been a godsend. I feel content with being ""good enough"".  I feel no shame about my struggles.  In fact I feel like shouting my story from the rooftops - if only to help other new mothers who feel like I did. I know how lucky I am but I am concerned for the women who aren't, who don't have someone fighting their corner with the GP, who don't have private medical insurance, who don't live in a postcode that provides such excellent services.   In the four years since my first baby, I've noticed a real change in the way people talk about mental health, but I would like to see a real change in the way mothers-to-be are prepared for what might happen, so it doesn't come as such a shock. And if a new mother even breathes a whisper about feeling down, she should be taken deadly seriously - because this can be deadly.  If you feel like I did, you don't have the ""baby blues"", you are unwell and need medical attention, just as you would for a broken leg or the flu. New mothers are vulnerable enough (both physically and mentally) without having to fight to be heard. Becoming a mother is life changing in a way that nobody can prepare for, but what we can prepare for is better support for maternal mental health.

Charity reveals abuse incident in Malawi,"The incident was said to have taken place in Malawi in 2009 An aid worker on a Scottish government-funded project was dismissed and reported to police for sexually abusing a 16-year-old girl, it has emerged. Christian charity Tearfund revealed details of the Malawi incident after the Scottish government contacted organisations it works with in the wake of the Oxfam abuse allegations. It involved a staff member at a partner organisation of Tearfund in 2009. The charity said it took ""swift and appropriate action"" to help the girl. Tearfund added it was ""deeply saddened"" by the incident. The Scottish government said International Development Minister Alasdair Allan had since met with Tearfund to ""discuss their response"". In February, the UK's Charity Commission launched an investigation into Oxfam's handling of claims its staff in Haiti after the earthquake in 2010 had hired prostitutes. Following the Oxfam scandal, Mr Allanwrote to Scottish charities urging them to ensure robust policies were in place to protect vulnerable groups. Details of the Malawi incident emerged in the Times newspaper after afreedom of information request,externalobtained a report sent from Tearfund to the Scottish government. The incident happened on a project that was part-funded with Scottish government cash. A spokeswoman for Tearfund said: ""The project was run by a partner organisation Tearfund was working with at the time and was partially funded by a grant from the Scottish government. ""The incident involved an employee of the partner organisation who abused someone within that organisation's care. ""When a Tearfund staff member in Malawi was notified of the allegation of abuse, even though the allegation did not involve a Tearfund staff member, we ensured the safeguarding procedures we had at the time were followed. ""A Tearfund Child Protection Officer also intervened to ensure that swift and appropriate action was taken. ""This included providing care for the individual who was harmed, and the partner organisation launching an investigation. The individual was provided counselling and moved away from the project."" Tearfund said it had ceased working with the partner organisation involved in 2010. The freedom of information request says the incident was reported to the Malawi police but no charges were brought. A disciplinary panel of Tearfund's partner investigated the case and the staff member was dismissed for gross misconduct. A spokesman for the Scottish government said: ""The vast majority of those working in international development and humanitarian emergencies do so in a diligent and appropriate manner. ""However we are deeply concerned about any reports of serious misconduct within the sector and we will not tolerate any form of human rights abuses or misconduct, wherever they take place. ""We expect all partner organisations to monitor their work closely, and to be pen, honest and transparent, especially on projects funded by the public sector."" The spokesman said Mr Allan's letter to international NGOs ""brought a report of an incident on a Scottish government part-funded Tearfund project to our attention for the first time"". He added that the Scottish government would  ""continue to work with partner organisations that demonstrate they have safeguarding policies in place to protect vulnerable groups"".

Massive quake follows Hawaii eruptions,"This video can not be played Lava flows are continuing from the Kilauea volcano in Hawaii A number of strong earthquakes have hit Hawaii's Big Island, a day after the eruption of the Kilauea volcano. One 6.9 magnitude quake, south-east of the volcano, was the most powerful to hit the US state since 1975. It briefly cut power and sent people fleeing from buildings but there was no tsunami warning. Meanwhile, several fresh eruptions spewed fountains of lava 30m (100ft), destroying several homes and leaving fissures on three streets. The Civil Defense Agency told any remaining residents to evacuate. It said there were deadly levels of dangerous sulphur dioxide gas in the air and emergency crews would not be able to help anyone affected. The new volcanic activity in Mt Kilauea's lower east rift zone amounted to ""vigorous lava spattering"", the US Geological Survey (USGS) said, adding that additional outbreaks in the area were likely. The USGS said ""vigorous lava spattering"" was happening The lava was not travelling more than a ""few tens of yards"" from the vents, which were on streets in the Leilani Estates neighbourhood near Big Island's eastern tip, the USGS said. However, ground deformation was continuing and there was high earthquake activity in the area, it said. Meanwhile, the level of the lava lake inside the volcano was continuing to drop. Two homes were destroyed in the latest activity, ABC quoted Hawaii island Mayor Harry Kim as saying. Maija Stenback, an eyewitness, told the BBC the eruption ""was like when someone plays the bass really heavy: you could really feel the power and the lava"". ""The colour was unbelievable, and the sound was unbelievable,"" she said. ""You could hear and feel the eruption a good half a mile away, and the closer you got, the more you could feel it."" Residents described fleeing their homes on Thursday evening. ""My family is safe, the rest of the stuff can be replaced. When I bought here 14 years [ago], I knew that this day would eventually come. Butthe reality is sinking in now,external,"" one resident told Hawaii News Now. A spokesperson for Hawaii's Mayor, Janet Snyder, said ""elevated levels"" of sulphur dioxide were stopping people returning to evacuated areas. ""It is quite toxic and in fact, even our first responders find it too hazardous at this time to go back into the sub-divisions without heavy, protective equipment,"" she said. Steaming cracks appeared moments before a fissure opened early on Friday morning Thursday's eruption prompted a local state of emergency and the mandatory evacuation of 1,700 residents. Community centres have been opened to provide shelter for evacuees. Kilauea is one of the world's most active volcanoes and the eruption follows a series of recent earthquakes. Officials had been warning residents all week they should be prepared to evacuate as an eruption would give little warning. A volcanic crater vent - known as Puu Oo - collapsed earlier this week, sending lava down the mountain's slopes towards populated areas. Dr Dougal Jerram, an earth scientist at the University of Oslo, told the BBC that the quake had ""occurred in the middle of a housing estate effectively, erupting through the roads, with magma shooting 30 metres up into the sky"". Hawaii's Governor, David Ige, said he had activated military reservists from the National Guard to help evacuate thousands of people. Allow Twitter content?

We're ready, and we'll be doing this every year all over Scotland."" Mr Mackay said people had travelled from all over Scotland and further afield for the march.

Teen calls for apology over MP's tweet,"Darcy Norgate voted for the first time in 2017's general election A teenager has demanded an apology from her MP after he called her an offensive name on Twitter. Darcy Norgate, 19, said she was shocked when Michael Fabricant replied to her with a slang word for female genitalia. She said he launched a ""personal attack"" after she questioned his commitment to Burntwood, Staffordshire. The MP for Lichfield tweeted that Ms Darcy had not said she was his constituent and he thought of the word as a synonym for ""twit"". Michael Fabricant responded to people who criticised him for his tweet to Darcy The exchange began with a tweet on Friday afternoon in which the Conservative MP said Labour was failing to meet expectations in the local elections and it had been a disappointing day for the party. Ms Darcy replied: ""Not as disappointing as Burntwood since you neglected it."" Minutes later, Mr Fabricant, 67, responded with the insult, saying she ""seems unaware that there is no vote this year in Burntwood! ""And I neglect no part of my lovely constituency. That's why I'm loved!"" Later, in a statement on Twitter, Mr Fabricant said Ms Darcy's profile did not indicate her age or location. He added that ""for all I know, she is a Russian troll in St Petersburg"" but he would be ""happy to meet and talk about politics"" if she contacted him ""the proper way through my Parliamentary website or letter"". Ms Darcy, a media student who lives in Burntwood, said she felt Mr Fabricant had tried to ""publicly humiliate"" her. ""It isn't the way I would expect any professional to behave,"" she said. ""My mum is a teacher and my dad works for the NHS and if they had spoken to clients or students that way, they would be sacked,"" she added. ""I don't want him to be sacked. I just want an apology, just to say 'I am sorry I shouldn't have said that'."" Michael Fabricant has been an MP since 1992 ""I feel like he used [the word] in a way to try and shut people down. But I feel I want to stand up for myself and other young women,"" she said. ""I never attacked him personally.""

YouTube removes videos selling cheating,"Bounty hunter Patty Mayo's channel has had multiple videos taken down YouTube stars are complaining after hundreds of videos containing adverts for an essay-writing service were removed from their channels. It followsa BBC Trending investigationwhich found more than 250 channels had YouTubers plugging EduBirdie. Many of the adverts urge students to use EduBirdie to hire a ""super smart nerd"" to write their essays. YouTube says promotion of essay-writing services isbanned,externalby its advertising policies. The adverts appear in the middle of videos covering a range of interests including: pranks, video games, fashion and dating. In most of them, the YouTube star breaks off from what they are doing, in order to promote EduBirdie. The BBC investigation uncovered more than 1,400 videos with a total of more than 700 million views containing EduBirdie adverts. In response to the discovery, universities minister Sam Gyimah said YouTube had a moral responsibility to act because the adverts were ""enabling and normalising cheating potentially on an industrial scale."" Universities minister, Sam Gyimah, said the ads presented cheating as ""a lifestyle choice"" YouTube emailed some channels warning that it would take down videos which contained EduBirdie adverts if they did not edit out the promotions by Friday. Since then a wave of disgruntled YouTubers have turned to Twitter to complain at the removal of their videos. One channel, To Catch A Cheater, said 49 of its videos - a year's worth of work - had disappeared. AldosWorldTv said it had lost more than 30 videos, and questioned why he had been able to post so many videos containing the adverts. TwinzTV, a US-based pranks channel posted on Twitter that ""YouTube deleted 138 of our videos without any explanation"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Some YouTubers, like Patty Mayo, who makes bounty hunter videos, said they had been in the process of editing out the offending adverts when their videos were taken down. In several of his ads Patty Mayo urged viewers to ""hire the super smart nerds at Edubirdie.com to write your essays and your papers for you."" He told BBC Trending that he did not condone or endorse cheating. YouTube has declined to comment on how many videos have come down, or if it also will allow channels to re-upload the videos without the adverts from EduBirdie, a company based in Ukraine. In a statement given to the BBC last week it said: ""YouTube creators may include paid endorsements as part of their content only if the product or service they are endorsing complies with our advertising policies. ""We do not allow ads for essay writing and so paid promotions of these services will be removed when we discover them. We will be working with creators going forward so they better understand that in video promotions must not promote dishonest activity."" Some YouTube stars including Adam Saleh and JMX had already taken down videos containing EduBirdie adverts before the purge on Friday. Adam Saleh had already removed EduBirdie ads from his channel Essay-writing services are not illegal. But any university student found to have submitted work done by someone else would face disciplinary action. ""If you've worked hard to get to university, you potentially throw it all away by cheating and getting found out. It is wrong, full stop,"" Mr Gyimah told the BBC. EduBirdie is run by a company called Boosta which operates several online essay-writing companies. It says it cannot be held responsible for what social influencers say on their channels. ""We give influencers total freedom on how they prefer to present the EduBirdie platform to their audience in a way they feel would be most relevant to their viewers,"" its said in a statement. ""We do admit that many tend to copy and paste each others' shout-outs with a focus on 'get someone to do your homework for you', but this is their creative choice. It added that a disclaimer on its website suggested work provided by EduBirdie was supplied only as a sample or a reference. EduBirdie's own channel on YouTube has also been severely pruned back.

"Girl, 16, burnt alive after India rape","The latest incident comes as India reels under a string of violent sexual crimes. A 16-year-old girl in India was burnt alive after her parents complained to village elders that she had been raped, according to police. Fourteen people have been arrested in connection with the attacks in the eastern Indian state of Jharkhand. Police said the elders had ordered the accused rapists to do 100 sit-ups and pay a 50,000 rupee (Â£550; $750) fine as punishment. They were so enraged they beat the girl's parents then set her on fire. ""The two accused thrashed the parents and rushed to the house where they set the girl ablaze with the help of their accomplices,"" Ashok Ram, the officer in charge of the local police station, told AFP news agency. Why India's rape crisis shows no signs of abating How do Indian parents talk to their children about rape? The girl was believed to have been abducted from her home while her parents were attending a wedding. Local police said she was raped by two men in a forested area near the village of Raja Kendua. Upon discovering the assault, her parents went to village elders to pursue charges against the suspected perpetrators. Councils of village elders carry no legal weight. However, they have significant influence in many parts of rural India and are a way of settling disputes without having to go through India's expensive judicial system. Police in the state say that they have arrested 14 of the 18 people they want to investigate with regards to the rape and subsequent murder. One of the two men accused of carrying out the attack has yet to be arrested,external, Bokaro inspector general of police Shambhu Thakur told the Hindustan Times. However, several village elders have been charged with passing unlawful orders and tampering with evidence. The latest incident comes as India reels from a string of violent sexual crimes. About 40,000 rape cases were reported in India in 2016. Many cases, however, are believed to go unreported because of the stigma that is attached to rape and sexual assault.

Trump knife crime comments 'ridiculous',"This video can not be played Trump: Blood on London hospital floor A senior London surgeon has hit back at US President Donald Trump for criticising the level of knife crime in the city while defending US gun laws. Prof Karim Brohi, who heads the group overseeing the city's trauma treatment, said it was ""ridiculous"" to suggest guns could help combat knife violence. He said the capital faced a ""serious issue"" but gunshot wounds were at least twice as lethal as knife injuries. Mr Trump's comments came in a speech to the National Rifle Association (NRA). The US president's address at the firearms lobby's conference on Fridayalso caused anger in France. In it he suggested the 2015 attacks on Paris could have been stopped by giving people guns. He mimicked gunmen summoning and shooting victims one by one, saying ""Boom! Come over here!"" and using his hand to imitate a gun being fired. Has London's murder rate overtaken New York's? No easy answers to London's killings Nine charts on rising knife crime in England and Wales French outrage after Trump mimics Paris attackers In the speech in Dallas, Texas, Mr Trump referred to reading a story ""that in London, which has unbelievably tough gun laws, a once very prestigious hospital right in the middle is like a war zone for horrible stabbing wounds"". It is unclear where Mr Trump sourced his information. However, leading London trauma surgeon Dr Martin Griffiths, who works at the Royal London Hospital, told BBC Radio 4 a month ago that his hospital was likened to an Afghan war zone. The interview was the basis fora Daily Mail article.,external Prof Brohi, who is also a trauma surgeon at the Royal London, is clinical director of the London Major Trauma System Directorate. The organisation has responsibility for co-ordination and policy development between hospitals in and around London dealing with serious injuries. Karim Brohi is clinical director of the London Major Trauma System Directorate In astatement,externalreleased by Barts NHS Trust, he said: ""We are proud of the excellent trauma care we provide and of our violence reduction programmes. ""The Royal London Hospital has cut the number of our young patients returning after further knife attacks from 45% to 1%. ""There is more we can all do to combat this violence, but to suggest guns are part of the solution is ridiculous. Gunshot wounds are at least twice as lethal as knife injuries and more difficult to repair. ""We are proud of our world-leading service and to serve the people of London."" Dr Griffiths had earlier responded to Mr Trump on Twitter with an image suggesting the president had missed the point, adding that he was ""happy to invite Mr Trump to my prestigious hospital"".

Mr Trump is due to visit the UK on 13 July, after previously cancelling a trip amid calls for mass protests. Referring to London in his NRA speech, Mr Trump, had said they don't have guns. They have knives and instead there's blood all over the floors of this hospital. ""They say it's as bad as a military war zone hospital. Knives, knives, knives, knives."" He mimed a stabbing motion. ""London hasn't been used to that. They're getting used to it. It's pretty tough."" At least 38 people in London have lost their lives to knife crime so far this year, the Met Police has said. But Marian Fitzgerald, a criminologist at the University of Kent, said although there had been a spike in knife-related deaths in London, it was a separate issue to gun control. She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""It's just politically convenient, in a speech to the gun rights lobby, to try and make those comparisons and they are totally spurious. The Met Police and London Mayor Sadiq Khan declined to comment on Mr Trump's latest remarks. Last year Mr Trump criticised Mr Khan for his handling of terrorist attacks in the city. In atweet,external, shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said she could ""hardly see how violent crime in London justifies the licensing of guns in the US"". Lib Dem home affairs spokesman Sir Ed Davey acknowledged crime had risen in the capital, but said Mr Trump's remarks were ""nevertheless ridiculous"" and revealed ""his ignorance of Britain"". The Home Office has not responded to the comments. The US president was criticised by Prime Minister Theresa May after he retweeted anti-Muslim videos posted online by the deputy leader of the far-right Britain First group. Mr Trump told her to focus on ""destructive radical Islamic terrorism"" in the UK, rather than on him Mr Trump linked a rise in recorded crime in England and Wales last October with the ""spread of radical Islamic terror"". The statistics covered offences ranging from burglary to fraud, prompting politicians to describe his comments as ""inflammatory"" and ""ignorant"" During his campaign for the US presidency in 2015, Mr Trump told MSNBC police were afraid to enter certain parts of London because they were ""so radicalised that the police are afraid for their own lives"". Then prime minister David Cameron's official spokeswoman said the view was ""wrong"" It was Mr Trump's fourth address to the NRA and his second in office. The last president to do so was Ronald Reagan in 1983. The lobby supported Mr Trump during his 2016 presidential election, spending more than $11m (Â£8m) in advertisements for him,according to the Center for Responsive Politics,external. After a high school shooting in Parkland, Florida, left 17 dead in February, Mr Trump said he would ""fight"" the NRA on gun control. But he later said there was ""not much political support"". His administration, however,has taken steps to ban bump stocks, which allow a rifle to shoot hundreds of rounds a minute. Why is US gun lobby NRA so controversial?

Trump on London 'war zone',"This video can not be played Trump: Blood on London hospital floor US President Donald Trump has criticised the level of knife crime in London, comparing one of the city's hospitals to a ""war zone"". His comments came in a speech to the National Rifle Association (NRA), in which he defended US gun laws. He also told the firearms lobby's conference in Dallas, Texas, that American gun rights were ""under siege"". Mr Trump is due to visit the UK this summer, after previously cancelling a trip amid calls for mass protests. ""I recently read a story that in London, which has unbelievably tough gun laws, a once very prestigious hospital right in the middle is like a war zone for horrible stabbing wounds,"" he said on Friday. ""They don't have guns. They have knives and instead there's blood all over the floors of this hospital. ""They say it's as bad as a military war zone hospital. Knives, knives, knives, knives."" He mimed a stabbing motion. ""London hasn't been used to that. They're getting used to it. It's pretty tough."" Has London's murder rate overtaken New York's? No easy answers to London's killings Nine charts on rising knife crime in England and Wales It is unclear where Mr Trump sourced his information.

Mr Trump also claimed that the terror attack in Paris in 2015 - in which 130 people were killed - could have been prevented if more people had been armed. ""The terrorists would have fled or been shot and it would have been a whole different story,"" he said. It was Mr Trump's fourth address to the NRA and his second in office. The last president to do so was Ronald Reagan in 1983. An estimated 80,000 people have attended this year's NRA convention in Dallas. The lobby supported Mr Trump during his 2016 presidential election, spending more than $11m (Â£8m) in advertisements for him,according to the Center for Responsive Politics,external. After a high school shooting in Parkland, Florida, left 17 dead in February, Mr Trump said he would ""fight"" the NRA on gun control.

UK knife crime in nine charts,"After falling for several years, knife crime in England and Wales is rising again. So what is happening? There were 43,516 knife crime offences in the 12 months ending March 2019. This is an 80% increase from the low-point in the year ending March 2014, when there were 23,945 offences, and is the highest number since comparable data was compiled. These statistics do not include those from Greater Manchester Police because of data recording issues. Out of the 44 police forces, 43 recorded a rise in knife crime since 2011. Police figures are prone to changes in counting rules and methods, but data for NHS hospitals in England over a similar period showed an 8% increase in admissions for assault by a sharp object, leading the Office for National Statistics (ONS) to conclude there had been a ""real change"" to the downward trend in knife crime. Doctors said the injuries they were treating were becoming more severe and the victims were getting younger, with increasing numbers of girls involved. All of the statistics here relate to England and Wales. Policing, criminal justice and sentencing are devolved in Scotland and Northern Ireland, which also collect crime data in slightly different ways. In the latest figures, which include only selected knife offences, about half, 21,700, were assaults that caused an injury or where there was an intent to cause serious harm; a further 20,172 involved robberies. These figures focus on homicides, or killings, a category comprising cases of murder, manslaughter and infanticide. In about two out of every five killings, the victim was fatally assaulted with a sharp object or stabbed to death. The number of knife-related homicides went from 272 in 2007 to 186 in 2015.  Since then it's risen every year, with a steep increase in 2017-18, when there were 285 killings, the highest figure since 1946. One in four victims were men aged 18-24. The figures also show 25% of victims were black - the highest proportion since data was first collected in 1997. Although knife crime is on the increase, it should be seen in context. It's relatively unusual for a violent incident to involve a knife, and rarer still for someone to need hospital treatment. Most violence is caused by people hitting, kicking, shoving or slapping someone, sometimes during a fight and often when they're drunk; the police figures on violence also include crimes of harassment and stalking. The Crime Survey for England and Wales, which includes offences that aren't reported to police, indicates that overall levels of violence have fallen by about a quarter since 2013. However, the police-recorded statistics - which tend to pick up more ""high harm"" crimes - have indicated that the most serious violent crime is increasing. In the year to March 2019, 22,041 people were cautioned, reprimanded or convicted for carrying a knife in England and Wales, most of whom were adults. But one in five - 4,451 - was under the age of 18. Knife crime tends to be more prevalent in large cities, particularly in London. For every 100,000 people in the capital, there were 169 knife offences in 2018-19. In 2018, figures from the mayor's office showed that young black and minority ethnic teenage boys and men were disproportionately affected, as both victims and perpetrators. The Metropolitan Police Chief Commissioner Cressida Dick has said tackling violence in London is her ""priority"". Next highest was the North West, with 93 knife offences per 100,000 population, and Yorkshire and the Humber, 86. The explanations for rising knife crime have ranged from police budget cuts, to gang violence and disputes between drug dealers. Some have also cited the steep decline in the use by police of stop and search. The powers enable officers to search people on the street if they have reasonable grounds to suspect they may be carrying weapons, illegal drugs, stolen property or items to be used to commit a crime. People can also be searched without reasonable grounds if a senior officer believes there's a risk of serious violence in a particular area. From 2009, the number of stops fell sharply across England and Wales, especially in London, primarily because of concerns that the measures unfairly targeted young black men, wasted police resources and were ineffective at catching criminals. Theresa May, as home secretary, led efforts to drive down the number of stops, but there's anecdotal evidence from police that young people are now more inclined to carry knives because of growing confidence they won't be stopped. The statistical basis for that is far from clear - but Scotland Yard, with the mayor of London's support, has begun increasing the use of stop and search again. Since 2010, police numbers have decreased by almost 20,000. Prime Minister Theresa Mayhas said there is no ""direct correlation""between the rise in knife crime and a fall in police numbers, but the issue is contested. In 2018, a Home Affairs Committee reportsaid police forces were ""struggling to cope""amid falling staff numbers anda leaked Home Office documentsaid they had ""likely contributed"" to a rise in serious violent crime. The average prison term for those jailed for carrying a knife or other offensive weapon has gone up from almost five months to well over eight months, with 85% serving at least three months, compared with 53% only 10 years ago. Sentences for all kinds of violent crime have been getting tougher, particularly for knife crime. The Ministry of Justice tracks the penalties imposed for those caught carrying knives and other offensive weapons in England and Wales. In the year ending December 2018, 37% of those dealt with were jailed and a further 18% were given a suspended prison sentence. The figures for 2008, when the data was first compiled, were 20% and 9% respectively. Over the same period, there's been a steady decline in the use of community sentences, and a sharp drop in cautions, from 30% to 11%. Public anxiety about knife crime, legislative changes and firmer guidance for judges and magistrates have led to the stiffer sentences, although offenders under 18 are still more likely to be cautioned than locked up.

Bank holiday set for record temperatures,"Geoff Barlow's Labrador retriever Jake enjoyed the sea at Southbourne, Essex, having just learned to swim UK temperatures are forecast to soar over the weekend, with Monday heading for a record high. Forecasters say temperatures could reach 28C (82F) on Monday in parts of England, making it the hottest early May Bank Holiday on record. The highest temperatures are expected in south-east England, particularly around London, as well as in East Anglia and the East Midlands. Northern England and Wales are likely to have highs of 23C. How hot is it where you are? It will be slightly cooler in south-west England, Scotland and Northern Ireland, with temperatures expected to range from 19C to 22C. The warmest early May Bank Holiday Monday on record was 23.6C, in 1999 - and this Monday could be the hottest since 1978, when the holiday was first introduced. The average high for the May Bank Holiday in London is about 18C. Red and Ginny soaked up the sun in Airmyn near Goole, East Yorkshire Dominic Wong, in Bournemouth, went for a spontaneous dip after taking this photo James and his dog Archie also basked in the sunshine in the Chiltern Hills, in south-east England Met Office forecaster Craig Snell said the record for Monday is likely to be broken, but not the record for the hottest day over the whole May Bank Holiday weekend - that was a temperature of 28.6C set on the Saturday in 1995. He said: ""23.6C is what we've got to beat, and we're forecasting highs of at least 26C, 27C, possibly 28C, so I think we can safely say that's going to be beaten. ""But whether or not we will beat the record for the whole weekend put together, we'll be close, but at the moment looking at it we may just come short."" Walkers were among those enjoying the Kennet and Avon Canal in Newbury, Berkshire Wind turbines dominate the horizon at Moreton, Wirral It will come in sharp contrast to last Monday, whensome parts of the UK experienced ""unseasonably cold weather""and saw more than half a month's rainfall in a day. Meanwhile the week before that, London experiencedthe warmest April day for nearly 70 yearswith temperatures over 29C, as well asthe hottest London Marathon on record. And in early April, parts of Scotland, northern England and north Wales were covered in heavy snow.

"I was convinced my baby deserved a better mumAt the end of maternal mental health week, one mother details her experiences with post-natal depression and the help she describes as being a ""godsend"".","At the end of maternal mental health awareness week, Alexandra Vanotti details her experience of post-natal anxiety and the help she received - which she describes as a godsend. My sister was on honeymoon in South Africa when my baby boy was born.  It was almost a fortnight before she was due home and I had an overwhelming fear that my baby would die before my sister got a chance to meet him. In my mind, over the coming weeks and months my beautiful baby died a thousand deaths. This, despite his clean bill of health. You may have twigged already that I wasn't well.  It took me a bit longer to realise. I had an uneventful pregnancy, albeit under the care of the high risk team at Chelsea and Westminster hospital in London. At the age of 21, I had undergone heart surgery, but at this stage my heart was fine and it was years since I had seen a cardiologist. During the first trimester, I was the textbook example of a glowing mother-to-be, full of excitement and wonder at the life growing inside me.  But as I approached the 18-week scan, I started feeling anxious. I read a leaflet on the potential health issues that might be picked up at the anomaly scan and I cried tears of terror.  But we passed it with no concern. The baby also passed the foetal heart ultrasound - a necessity with my congenital heart problem.  And yet I couldn't shake off the sense of foreboding. As my due date grew nearer, my focus shifted to childbirth and I was bombarded with unwelcome thoughts of sudden heart failure, a twisted umbilical cord around the baby's neck. Stillbirth. On the surface, though, I was more serene and calm than my family had ever seen. I told nobody of my fears. ""Pack your hospital bag,"" my mother and sister urged,  alarmed that with only one month to go, I'd not made one baby purchase.  My husband dragged me to choose buggies and cots, rather than the other way round.  I was told many times it was wonderful that I was so laid back.  My mind, however, was telling me that my baby would die, so what was the point of buying anything? Our baby boy was born on 22 January, 2014. Strangely, despite the pain of contractions, I was calm and cheerful throughout labour.  When he arrived I was awestruck, spending 12 hours straight just gazing at him in wonder.  He was the most beautiful baby I'd ever seen in my life and I happily told anyone who'd listen.  I was completely besotted and blissfully happy. Above all, I was relieved that despite my fears, he and I had survived childbirth together. It was two days later in hospital that I suddenly felt my stomach clench with fear, as I was hit by a crushing sense of responsibility.  How could I keep my baby safe in this big scary world?  In my mind, the ways in which he could be harmed were infinite.  I would have to be on guard the whole time to make sure nothing happened to him. My nightmare with postnatal anxiety, OCD and insomnia had begun. My primary obsession was that my baby would die in his sleep - therefore, I had to stay awake while he slept.  To be fair, this is a common concern to new parents. Like many new dads, my husband was also on edge and would hover over the sleeping baby to check he was breathing.  But for him, the solution was simple - he bought an under-mattress movement sensor, which would sound an alarm if the baby stopped breathing. My husband slept soundly after this. I, on the other hand, would just be drifting off, only to jolt awake as I felt the need to check, double check, triple check that I'd turned the sensor on.  In my mind, the sensor became the only thing standing between my baby and cot death, so I took it everywhere, even slotting it under the mattress in the pram, switching it on whenever I stopped. Walking down the high street on one of our first excursions out as a family of three, we were overtaken by a little boy on a scooter, his mother close behind.  Instantly a series of intrusive disturbing images flitted through my mind - the scooter veering off the pavement into traffic, the boy hit by a car, a little body lying in the street, the mother screaming hysterically.  My legs turned to jelly and I had to hold onto the buggy to stop myself falling.  The little boy and his mother continued on their way, oblivious. These intrusive images continued, several times a day. Some seemed like reasonable and appropriate fears, such as dropping the baby as I carried him down the stairs, letting go of the buggy and watching it roll into the road in the path of a car.  But others were shocking and strange - accidentally putting the baby in the microwave,  opening our front door to a stranger who'd fling acid at me and the baby, dropping him off the side of a ferry and watching him disappear into the waves below. Torturous little horror films that ran through my mind all day. I felt fearful the whole time, full of adrenalin, the way you feel when you've almost tripped while descending a flight of stairs - racing heart, plummeting stomach, jelly legs.  I was so preoccupied with my anxious thoughts that I was disconnected from everything else. When the baby was not even a week old, my husband, alarmed by my mental state, made an emergency doctor's appointment.  Initially the doctor talked about baby blues and how I might find myself feeling better in a week or so, but my husband put his foot down and demanded a referral for therapy. On the NHS it would be a four-to-six-week wait.  But thanks to our private medical insurance, a week later I was sitting in the waiting room at the Priory in Roehampton waiting for my first psychiatric assessment. a persistent feeling of sadness and low mood no longer enjoying things you used to enjoy lack of energy and feeling tired all the time trouble sleeping at night feeling you're unable to look after your baby problems concentrating and making decisions loss of appetite or an increased appetite (comfort eating) feeling agitated, irritable or very apathetic (you ""can't be bothered"") feelings of guilt, hopelessness and self-blame difficulty bonding with your baby frightening thoughts - for example, about hurting your baby; these can be scary, but they're very rarely acted upon thinking about suicide and self-harm Source:NHS mental health problems and pregnancy,external #maternalmentalhealth, #maternalmentalhealthawareness, #askher The initial assessment involved no therapy, but what seemed like hundreds of questions.  The psychiatrist very quickly ascertained that I was suffering from postnatal anxiety and OCD, and that I would benefit from cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT).  She explained a sliding scale of anxiety, with most people experiencing it to a certain extent.  On her scale I wasn't even near the top, and she reassured me that with therapy I would soon start to feel better.  I nodded numbly, wondering just how bad you had to feel to reach the top of the anxiety scale.  I felt I was living in my own private hell. The following week I left the baby with my mother and arrived at the Priory for my first therapy session with a CBT specialist.  Cognitive behavioural therapy doesn't involve going back over past issues, instead it looks at current problems and, in particular, it identifies your core beliefs.  These are often unrecognised deep-seated beliefs that can affect your life and your behaviour. In our first session, my therapist quickly identified that I felt utterly crushed by the responsibility of keeping the baby safe.  She questioned me gently for almost the whole 90-minute session. Reaching the core belief was like peeling individual layers of an onion, with searching questions that probed deeper and deeper until the fundamental core was revealed. I broke down in tears and shook with emotion as I finally admitted out loud, ""I'm the only person who can keep my baby safe"".  This was my belief - and I hadn't even known it.  Now to work on contesting that belief. I didn't get better immediately.  Not at all. In fact it took nine months of counselling.  I found therapy really hard work and didn't look forward to my weekly sessions.  I would leave them feeling completely wrung out, emotionally exhausted, and sometimes I couldn't understand why my therapist often went - in my opinion - off on a tangent. One week she questioned me on my aspirations as a mother and, after listening to me talk about home-cooked food, a clean and tidy house, losing my baby weight, she suggested gently that I stop striving for perfection, and instead aim for ""good enough"".  I looked at her blankly.  ""What do you mean 'good enough?'  Why would I settle for good enough?  I want to be the best mum possible,"" I said.  She kept pressing.  I kept resisting.  I left that session feeling frustrated.  In my opinion, good enough meant not enough.  And why were we wasting valuable time on this when we should be tackling the ""bully in my head"" as I had come to call my anxiety?  I yearned to be better, back to my old self. Everywhere I went, I saw danger.  It was worse at night.  I could almost feel a tangible sense of impending doom.  I knew I wouldn't get more than three or four hours' sleep - the baby suffered from silent reflux and woke every 45 minutes after midnight.  But even the corners of the room seemed darker and more threatening in the evening. At night, trying to stop myself falling asleep mid-feed, I found even more horrors on the internet.  ""The dog ate my baby's head,"" was one particularly unhelpful headline which had me jumping out of bed at four in the morning, running downstairs to shake my husband awake.  ""He's going to get mauled by a dog,"" I cried.  He looked at me uncomprehending, bleary eyed, but I couldn't be calmed until he got out of bed and helped me compose an email to my parents and sister about the family cockapoos. Another news article about baby seats sent shock waves through my core.  Babies shouldn't be kept in their car seats for longer than two hours, it said.  After reading this, nothing my husband said could convince me to take a car journey longer than half an hour, in case the baby asphyxiated en route. ""I am so anxious,"" I confided tearfully in my mother.  She nodded knowingly and said, ""It never goes away, once you're a parent"".  She didn't realise the extent of my anxiety.  I took her words quite literally to mean that I would feel this horrendous for the rest of my life.  The bully would never go away.  I couldn't possibly survive at that level of anxiety. I thought I had made a mistake, that I was not cut out for motherhood.  And then came guilt for not being thankful for my beautiful child. Ironically I embraced the days when I just felt a dull depression rather than racing anxiety - it was a relief. ""This is normal,"" I told myself. ""All mothers feel this and it will pass."" To say I lost myself that first year is no over-exaggeration.  I don't recognise my face in photos, my false smile.  Delirious and headachy from sleep deprivation, sugar became my crutch and I piled on all the weight I'd lost after giving birth.  I didn't get my hair done for more than six months.  Putting on a pair of earrings was too much effort.  Never mind ""good enough"", I was failing miserably at being an alpha mum and I knew everyone would be able to see through the camouflage of makeup so it wasn't worth the effort.  And I was so very tired, all the time.  I hated what was happening to me, and I imagined that my little boy would one day realise he'd drawn the short straw and reject me.  I felt he deserved better than me. The light bulb moment came a few months in, after the ""good enough"" session.  My therapist helped me finally realise that my quest for perfection was fuelling my anxiety.  My core belief in this instance?  That my self worth was measured by how well I could do things.  Before baby, everything from documents at work, to the way my home was decorated, to sourcing a quirky restaurant for dinner with friends, I had put a huge amount of effort into making it as good as possible.  I prided myself on being super-organised. My school friends had a nickname for me - The Guru.  I never missed a birthday.  I loved doing thoughtful things for my friends and family.  My self worth was completely tied up in being this Guru.  Naturally I had wanted to be the best mother possible.  Before having a baby I had all the time in the world to invest in my pursuit of perfection.  But as most new parents discover, you can't control anything about a baby, and it's natural to feel like your life has been turned upside down. What would happen if I just stopped? I listened to my therapist and reluctantly decided to give it a go, settling for ""good enough"" rather than perfection.  The world didn't stop turning.  The house didn't fall down.  I started being kinder and more forgiving of myself.  I scrapped my epic ""to do"" list.  I stopped frantically cleaning the kitchen and making the house presentable when the baby napped. Instead, I would curl up next to him and nap too.  Or I'd relax with a half-hour treat of daytime TV or trashy magazines (""The trashier the better,"" my therapist encouraged).  I ordered takeaways.  I let the dirty washing pile up and ordered myself not to panic about it. Gradually, life got easier.  It felt almost rebellious and sloppy at first, deliberately turning my back on everything I'd strived towards for such a long time.  But I soon realised that nobody noticed these changes apart from me.  My family and friends didn't love me for the things I did, or how well I did them.  They loved me, to quote Bridget Jones, ""Just the way you are"". It was deliriously freeing.  As I stopped fretting about everything being perfect, I started living in the moment - not dwelling on the past or worrying about the future.  Concentrating on one day at a time, I suddenly realised one day that the scary visions and intrusive thoughts were receding. ""You're wearing earrings,"" exclaimed my therapist one week.  I self-consciously touched my ear and smiled.  Somehow it hadn't seemed like such an effort this morning. Like many people, my life has been touched by tragic and traumatic periods, but my first year of motherhood was undoubtedly the toughest time of my life.   I think it is safe to say that I was traumatised afterwards.  It took a huge toll on my husband, too, watching his wife, his best friend, fall apart before his eyes, turning into someone he didn't recognise. Three years later, we felt ready to try for our second baby and I was lucky to fall pregnant quickly.  I was excited but feared I would fall ill again.  The Chelsea and Westminster midwives were really on the ball, though. As soon as I mentioned my previous history during my first check-up, I was referred to the hospital's perinatal service. I met with psychotherapist Danny once a month or so during my pregnancy.  I talked at length about my past experiences and he quickly saw I had convinced myself that the same thing would happen all over again.  Danny reassured me that I had a good support network and that we could act swiftly if I fell unwell.  I also saw the hospital psychiatrist, who strongly recommended anti-depressants if I started feeling down.  My husband, who previously had quite strong opinions on anti-depressants, was in full agreement that this time I should take them if needed. It started so well.  Our baby's birth was calm and without complications.  Another beautiful little boy.  Bringing him home, I felt our little family was complete, and was elated I'd never have to go through pregnancy again.  For the first two weeks I was on a real high - this is what motherhood was meant to feel like.  But then he started showing signs of reflux - coughing and spluttering during feeds, hugely disrupted sleep, grimacing in pain.  I braced myself for a tough few months but knew that we would survive - after all, we'd done it before with his older brother. A month after the baby arrived, we lost my elderly father-in-law when he suffered a bad fall.  My grieving husband had to organise not just a UK funeral but his father's repatriation to Italy, an enormous task which took up all his time.  I developed mastitis.  The baby failed his hearing test, showing signs of hearing loss.  He wasn't putting on weight (due to his struggles with reflux and breastfeeding).  I was diagnosed with a hernia, which needed surgery - and subsequently developed a dangerous infection which required daily visits to hospital.  Our troubles seemed never-ending. I felt massively overwhelmed when left to look after both boys by myself.  I literally couldn't put the baby down because of his reflux, which meant that showering, getting dressed, even going to the bathroom was an issue.  Getting out of the house with both boys felt like planning a mission to Mars.  ""Don't you feel utterly panicked when you need to be somewhere at a certain time?"" I asked a friend, who was a new mum.  ""Well,"" she said, frowning, ""It's a mammoth task, of course, but I wouldn't say I panic.""  I felt self-conscious for over-sharing.  I was convinced I couldn't cope.  What totally passed me by was that everyone struggles.  Looking after babies is hard work, end of story.  But for some reason, I felt I needed to have a handle on it - my need for control creeping back in. Danny came to visit me several times at home and often carried out my therapy sessions while I nursed the baby.  There was no way I could have managed the journey to the hospital in those early days. Both my babies suffered from digestive problems and would scream in discomfort for hours at a time, and both times I cut out cows milk from my diet. But I became obsessive over everything that passed my lips, convinced I was slowly poisoning my baby through my breast milk. At one point, I considered a total elimination diet, eating only pear and lamb, until my mother talked me out of it. One night, staying at my parents' house while my husband was in Italy, I was delirious with exhaustion after two hours trying to settle my miserable screaming baby.  I thought about putting the baby down, walking out the front door and stepping in front of a bus.  Five minutes later I was tearfully apologising to my son, nuzzling his neck, promising I'd never leave him.  I have never had suicidal thoughts and that moment terrified me into action.  In the morning I told my mother how I'd felt.  And after half an hour of arguing with her - I insisted I could get better by myself - I agreed to start taking anti-depressants.  Within a week, I had stopped crying every day - something I hadn't even realised I'd been doing - and the cloud lifted. A year later, I am still on anti-depressants, and still see Danny and the team from the Chelsea and Westminster perinatal service. They've been a godsend. I feel content with being ""good enough"".  I feel no shame about my struggles.  In fact I feel like shouting my story from the rooftops - if only to help other new mothers who feel like I did. I know how lucky I am but I am concerned for the women who aren't, who don't have someone fighting their corner with the GP, who don't have private medical insurance, who don't live in a postcode that provides such excellent services.   In the four years since my first baby, I've noticed a real change in the way people talk about mental health, but I would like to see a real change in the way mothers-to-be are prepared for what might happen, so it doesn't come as such a shock. And if a new mother even breathes a whisper about feeling down, she should be taken deadly seriously - because this can be deadly.  If you feel like I did, you don't have the ""baby blues"", you are unwell and need medical attention, just as you would for a broken leg or the flu. New mothers are vulnerable enough (both physically and mentally) without having to fight to be heard. Becoming a mother is life changing in a way that nobody can prepare for, but what we can prepare for is better support for maternal mental health.

Police seize Navalny at Putin protestThe opposition leader is detained at a rally in Moscow before the Russian president's inauguration.4h4 hours agoEurope,"This video can not be played Police seize the opposition leader at a rally in Moscow Riot police have seized Russia's most prominent opposition leader, Alexei Navalny, at a Moscow rally two days before Vladimir Putin's inauguration. He was carried away struggling through the crowd of demonstrators, who had gathered to protest at Mr Putin's forthcoming fourth term in office. The rallies in Moscow and Russia's second city, St Petersburg, were not approved by the authorities. At least 1,000 arrests were reportedly made at rallies across Russia. Early on Sunday, Mr Navalny was released from police custody after being charged with organising a rally and resisting the police.

US revives Second Fleet to counter Russia,"The Second Fleet will be based at its former home - Norfolk, Virginia The US Navy has said it will re-establish its Second Fleet, as Russia becomes more assertive. Chief of Naval Operations Adm John Richardson said the fleet, disbanded in 2011, would oversee forces on the US East Coast and North Atlantic. He said the National Defense Strategy, published earlier this year, made it clear that the era of great power competition had returned. The strategy makes countering Russia and China a priority. The fleet, which was disbanded for cost-saving and structural reasons, will be based in its previous home - Norfolk, Virginia. ""Our National Defense Strategy makes clear that we're back in an era of great power competition as the security environment continues to grow more challenging and complex,"" Adm Richardson said in an announcement on board the USS George H W Bush at Norfolk. ""That's why today, we're standing up Second Fleet to address these changes, particularly in the north Atlantic."" US-Russia at dangerous low, Trump says Putin nuclear slideshow echoes Cold War By Jonathan Marcus, defence and diplomatic correspondent The re-establishment of the US Second Fleet is part of a wider strategy of re-orientating the US armed forces towards a world of renewed big power competition and away from the counter-insurgency campaigns they have been fighting over recent decades. In this case the focus is Russia - a response to its stepped up naval activity of recent years. The new headquarters will give more coherent command arrangements for US warships operating in the Atlantic. Nato is also planning to set up a new Joint Forces Command covering much the same region - the Americans have offered to host this in Norfolk, Virginia. The existing pattern of US naval operations is also due to change significantly. US Defence Secretary James Mattis insists that he wants less predictable deployments, of shorter duration. Experts say a carrier strike group is likely to be deployed more frequently in European waters. Adm Richardson added that the fleet would ""exercise operational and administrative authority over assigned ships, aircraft and landing forces"". The headquarters staff would begin with just 15 personnel, increasing to more than 200. It has not yet been decided who will command the fleet and what assets it will include. Norfolk has also been proposed as a host for the new Nato Joint Force Command for the Atlantic. Nato officials say Russia has increased naval patrols in the Baltic Sea, the North Atlantic and the Arctic, and its submarine activity is at its highest level since the Cold War. Relations between Russia and the West have deteriorated in recent months amid allegations of Russian meddling in US elections, Moscow's support for President Bashar al-Assad of Syria and the poisoning of former spy Sergei Skripal, for which the UK blames Russia. Formed as Second Task Fleet after World War Two Redesignated as Second Fleet in 1950 to support Nato Responsible for 17m sq km (6.7m sq miles) of the North Atlantic Before 2011 oversaw 126 ships, 4,500 aircraft and 90,000 personnel Putin nuclear slideshow echoes Cold War Russian jet 'flew close to US plane' US Navy video captures Russian flyby.

Stoke City relegated after defeat,"Patrick van Aanholt's goal denied Stoke a draw that would have kept alive their survival hopes until at least later on Saturday Stoke's 10-year stay in the Premier League has come to an end after they were relegated to the Championship by Crystal Palace's second-half resurgence. Home fans streamed out of the Bet365 Stadium immediately after Patrick van Aanholt's winner, with long-time chairman Peter Coates looking on miserably. The afternoon had started far better for the hosts. Manager Paul Lambert - appointed in January to turn the Potters around -  had celebrated wildly with Xherdan Shaqiri after the midfielder's free-kick opened the scoring just before the break. But James McArthur skipped clear down the left and side-footed home the leveller, before Van Aanholt pounced on Ryan Shawcross' under-hit backpass to consign Stoke to the second tier. Patrick van Aanholt commiserated with Stoke after scoring the winner that condemned them to the second tier... ...a gesture appreciated by the hosts The Potters' players - who finished 13th last season - collapsed to the turf as a first top-flight relegation since 1985 sank in. Crystal Palace's Mamadou Sakho was one of a number of visiting players to console their opponents after the final whistle, with goalkeeper Jack Butland in tears as some of the remaining home supporters defiantly chanted their lifelong allegiance to the club. Reaction: Stoke too big to stay down - Lambert Xherdan Shaqiri signed for Â£12m from Inter Milan in 2015 Before kick-off, a fan implored the rest of the Bet365 Stadium to do ""whatever it takes"" for victory over the public address system. The crowd responded with incessant noise, but - for the vast majority of the match - the Stoke attack was too quiet. As so often, it was only when Shaqiri got on the ball that the hosts looked able to unpick the opposition defence. The Switzerland international's cross was headed weakly wide by Mame Biram Diouf in Stoke's best chance before his free-kick found the net with the game's first shot on target. The 26-year-old's pass should have put Badou Ndiaye clean through on goal in the second half, but the Senegal midfielder miscontrolled when a settling second goal beckoned for Stoke. Shaqiri has spoken this season ofa ""lack of quality"" among his team-mates,externaland was planning talks with the Stoke management in the summer regardless of whether the club had stayed up. Formerly of Inter Milan and Bayern Munich, he will surely be playing top-flight football somewhere next season, with the likes of England international Butland and Wales midfielder Joe Allen also likely to exit. All the reaction after Stoke are relegated Peter Coates (centre) was joined in the executive seats by Stoke legend Gordon Banks (in red tie) Stoke's demise is even more damning on those who do not share the teamsheet with Shaqiri. Record signing Giannelli Imbula has spent the campaign on loan at French strugglers Toulouse. Defender Kevin Wimmer, bought last summer for Â£18m, has been dropped down to the club's under-23 side, where he is joined by out-of-favour Â£12m striker Saido Berahino. Lambert's midfield options on the bench consisted of the ageing trio of Darren Fletcher, Charlie Adam and Stephen Ireland. The club have not lacked for funds from Coates, but too many of their big-money purchases have been missing in inaction. How it looks at the bottom of the Premier League Roy Hodgson took charge after Palace's owners called time on Frank de Boer's short tenure at the club It was a result that mathematically confirmed Crystal Palace's place in the Premier League next season, even if survival had become increasingly clear through an unbeaten April. Considering the visitors' start to the season, it will also ensure an almighty final-day party at the always-boisterous Selhurst Park. Palace lost their first seven league matches this season without scoring a single goal. The appointment of Roy Hodgson in September was greeted with doubts by many whose most recent memory of the 70-year-old was leading England's calamitous Euro 2016 campaign. But he has shored up the Eagles' defence while, less predictably, giving the likes of Wilfried Zaha and Ruben Loftus-Cheek the freedom to pose a threat at the opposite end. In the final, wide-open exchanges, the visitors looked more likely to add to the scoreline than the hosts salvage their survival chances. McArthur knitted together the visitors' midfield, scored the goal that turned the game and recorded the joint-highest passing accuracy in the Stoke half of any Palace starter Stoke manager Paul Lambert, speaking to Sky Sports:""It is a tough afternoon. I am feeling for everyone connected with the club. ""When teams don't get results you can be sleep-walking into positions you don't want to be in. We never had enough. Since I came in the lads have given everything, but we came short. It is a chance to rebuild. ""It is difficult to come in mid-January to try to assess the team and I had a chat with the players on what went wrong. ""No-one can point a finger at the effort of the players."" This video can not be played Stoke have to bounce back up - Lambert Crystal Palace manager Roy Hodgson:""After seven games, or after 11 games with four points, I never saw it coming. ""I was hoping it would be a low-scoring year in terms of points for the lower sides and we'd just scrape over the line. ""But we came here basically safe. I couldn't see us going down with 38 points, so I think it was a great show of character from us to come here and play really well. ""It's not easy having that euphoria from last week and then to come to a place like this, where they're fighting for their lives, and put on a performance like we did."" This video can not be played Hodgson sympathises with relegated Stoke after Palace win Crystal Palace are the first top-flight team since Liverpool in the 1899-1900 season to avoid relegation despite losing their first seven matches of the season. Since beating Huddersfield in his first Premier League match in charge, the Potters have collected just seven points from 13 games under Lambert. Crystal Palace have not lost any of their past 13 Premier League games against sides starting the day in the bottom half of the division, winning eight. Of players with at least 15 Premier League goals, no player has scored a higher percentage from outside the box than Shaqiri (67%, level with former Newcastle and Tottenham winger David Ginola). Stoke have failed to win any of the four Premier League matches they have been leading at half-time under Lambert. By contrast, Crystal Palace have won three of their past seven Premier League games they have trailed at the break. Stoke head to Swansea on Sunday, 13 May for their final Premier League game for at least a year, while Palace take on West Brom at the same time.

"'Most wanted' man arrested in BarcelonaJamie Acourt had evaded capture for two years by using false identities, police say.1han hour agoLondon","Jamie Acourt, pictured in police custody in Spain, faces an extradition hearing One of Britain's most wanted fugitives, Jamie Acourt, has been captured in Spain on suspicion of drug offences. A Spanish police source told the BBC that the 41-year-old from south London had used false identities to evade capture for two years. Mr Acourt, who was wanted by police investigating the large-scale supply of drugs, was arrested in Barcelona on Friday. On Saturday he was remanded in custody by a Spanish high court judge. He appeared in front of the judge in Madrid via video-link from Barcelona. A former suspect inStephen Lawrence's murder in 1993, Mr Acourt has always denied any involvement in the killing. Armed officers detained Mr Acourt after he left the Metropolitan Sagrada Familia Gym in the Spanish city on Friday afternoon. He was arrested as part of operation Captura, a joint effort by the National Crime Agency (NCA), Metropolitan Police and Spanish National Police. A senior Spanish police source told the BBC police believe Mr Acourt had taken ""great care"" and ""plenty of security measures"" to avoid getting caught. ""He had protection. He had help. He didn't live a normal, relaxing life. He was using false identities, false names,"" the source said. This video can not be played Jamie Acourt was led away in handcuffs from a gym in Barcelona, witness Simon McDonald told the BBC's Tom Burridge Police believe Mr Acourt was using four or five different branches of the Metropolitan chain of gyms in Barcelona. The BBC understands from a source at the gym that he had been a member at the one near the Sagrada Familia cathedral for ""a long time"" and he was seen there on a regular basis. Police said he was moving around Spain and spending time in ""places where a tourist could disappear"". Recently, police believe he had been living in Barcelona. The investigation to find him took years and was a close collaboration between Spanish National Police and the NCA. When arrested he told police he was an Italian tourist, according to the source. Jamie Acourt at the 1998 public inquiry into the killing of Stephen Lawrence Mr Acourt was last seen in the UK on 1 February 2016, in the Eltham area and was known to visit south-west London and areas of Surrey. A spokesman for the Met said: ""The European Arrest Warrant was issued as part of the Met's efforts to trace Mr Acourt in relation to an investigation into the unlawful supply of controlled substances. ""This relates to an investigation launched in 2016 by detectives from the Serious and Organised Crime Command. ""Extradition proceedings now await.""

"I was convinced my baby deserved a better mum'Most wanted' man arrested in BarcelonaJamie Acourt had evaded capture for two years by using false identities, police say.2h2 hours agoLondon","At the end of maternal mental health awareness week, Alexandra Vanotti details her experience of post-natal anxiety and the help she received - which she describes as a godsend. My sister was on honeymoon in South Africa when my baby boy was born.  It was almost a fortnight before she was due home and I had an overwhelming fear that my baby would die before my sister got a chance to meet him. In my mind, over the coming weeks and months my beautiful baby died a thousand deaths. This, despite his clean bill of health. You may have twigged already that I wasn't well.  It took me a bit longer to realise. I had an uneventful pregnancy, albeit under the care of the high risk team at Chelsea and Westminster hospital in London. At the age of 21, I had undergone heart surgery, but at this stage my heart was fine and it was years since I had seen a cardiologist. During the first trimester, I was the textbook example of a glowing mother-to-be, full of excitement and wonder at the life growing inside me.  But as I approached the 18-week scan, I started feeling anxious. I read a leaflet on the potential health issues that might be picked up at the anomaly scan and I cried tears of terror.  But we passed it with no concern. The baby also passed the foetal heart ultrasound - a necessity with my congenital heart problem.  And yet I couldn't shake off the sense of foreboding. As my due date grew nearer, my focus shifted to childbirth and I was bombarded with unwelcome thoughts of sudden heart failure, a twisted umbilical cord around the baby's neck. Stillbirth. On the surface, though, I was more serene and calm than my family had ever seen. I told nobody of my fears. ""Pack your hospital bag,"" my mother and sister urged,  alarmed that with only one month to go, I'd not made one baby purchase.  My husband dragged me to choose buggies and cots, rather than the other way round.  I was told many times it was wonderful that I was so laid back.  My mind, however, was telling me that my baby would die, so what was the point of buying anything? Our baby boy was born on 22 January, 2014. Strangely, despite the pain of contractions, I was calm and cheerful throughout labour.  When he arrived I was awestruck, spending 12 hours straight just gazing at him in wonder.  He was the most beautiful baby I'd ever seen in my life and I happily told anyone who'd listen.  I was completely besotted and blissfully happy. Above all, I was relieved that despite my fears, he and I had survived childbirth together. It was two days later in hospital that I suddenly felt my stomach clench with fear, as I was hit by a crushing sense of responsibility.  How could I keep my baby safe in this big scary world?  In my mind, the ways in which he could be harmed were infinite.  I would have to be on guard the whole time to make sure nothing happened to him. My nightmare with postnatal anxiety, OCD and insomnia had begun. My primary obsession was that my baby would die in his sleep - therefore, I had to stay awake while he slept.  To be fair, this is a common concern to new parents. Like many new dads, my husband was also on edge and would hover over the sleeping baby to check he was breathing.  But for him, the solution was simple - he bought an under-mattress movement sensor, which would sound an alarm if the baby stopped breathing. My husband slept soundly after this. I, on the other hand, would just be drifting off, only to jolt awake as I felt the need to check, double check, triple check that I'd turned the sensor on.  In my mind, the sensor became the only thing standing between my baby and cot death, so I took it everywhere, even slotting it under the mattress in the pram, switching it on whenever I stopped. Walking down the high street on one of our first excursions out as a family of three, we were overtaken by a little boy on a scooter, his mother close behind.  Instantly a series of intrusive disturbing images flitted through my mind - the scooter veering off the pavement into traffic, the boy hit by a car, a little body lying in the street, the mother screaming hysterically.  My legs turned to jelly and I had to hold onto the buggy to stop myself falling.  The little boy and his mother continued on their way, oblivious. These intrusive images continued, several times a day. Some seemed like reasonable and appropriate fears, such as dropping the baby as I carried him down the stairs, letting go of the buggy and watching it roll into the road in the path of a car.  But others were shocking and strange - accidentally putting the baby in the microwave,  opening our front door to a stranger who'd fling acid at me and the baby, dropping him off the side of a ferry and watching him disappear into the waves below. Torturous little horror films that ran through my mind all day. I felt fearful the whole time, full of adrenalin, the way you feel when you've almost tripped while descending a flight of stairs - racing heart, plummeting stomach, jelly legs.  I was so preoccupied with my anxious thoughts that I was disconnected from everything else. When the baby was not even a week old, my husband, alarmed by my mental state, made an emergency doctor's appointment.  Initially the doctor talked about baby blues and how I might find myself feeling better in a week or so, but my husband put his foot down and demanded a referral for therapy. On the NHS it would be a four-to-six-week wait.  But thanks to our private medical insurance, a week later I was sitting in the waiting room at the Priory in Roehampton waiting for my first psychiatric assessment. a persistent feeling of sadness and low mood no longer enjoying things you used to enjoy lack of energy and feeling tired all the time trouble sleeping at night feeling you're unable to look after your baby problems concentrating and making decisions loss of appetite or an increased appetite (comfort eating) feeling agitated, irritable or very apathetic (you ""can't be bothered"") feelings of guilt, hopelessness and self-blame difficulty bonding with your baby frightening thoughts - for example, about hurting your baby; these can be scary, but they're very rarely acted upon thinking about suicide and self-harm Source:NHS mental health problems and pregnancy,external #maternalmentalhealth, #maternalmentalhealthawareness, #askher The initial assessment involved no therapy, but what seemed like hundreds of questions.  The psychiatrist very quickly ascertained that I was suffering from postnatal anxiety and OCD, and that I would benefit from cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT).  She explained a sliding scale of anxiety, with most people experiencing it to a certain extent.  On her scale I wasn't even near the top, and she reassured me that with therapy I would soon start to feel better.  I nodded numbly, wondering just how bad you had to feel to reach the top of the anxiety scale.  I felt I was living in my own private hell. The following week I left the baby with my mother and arrived at the Priory for my first therapy session with a CBT specialist.  Cognitive behavioural therapy doesn't involve going back over past issues, instead it looks at current problems and, in particular, it identifies your core beliefs.  These are often unrecognised deep-seated beliefs that can affect your life and your behaviour. In our first session, my therapist quickly identified that I felt utterly crushed by the responsibility of keeping the baby safe.  She questioned me gently for almost the whole 90-minute session. Reaching the core belief was like peeling individual layers of an onion, with searching questions that probed deeper and deeper until the fundamental core was revealed. I broke down in tears and shook with emotion as I finally admitted out loud, ""I'm the only person who can keep my baby safe"".  This was my belief - and I hadn't even known it.  Now to work on contesting that belief. I didn't get better immediately.  Not at all. In fact it took nine months of counselling.  I found therapy really hard work and didn't look forward to my weekly sessions.  I would leave them feeling completely wrung out, emotionally exhausted, and sometimes I couldn't understand why my therapist often went - in my opinion - off on a tangent. One week she questioned me on my aspirations as a mother and, after listening to me talk about home-cooked food, a clean and tidy house, losing my baby weight, she suggested gently that I stop striving for perfection, and instead aim for ""good enough"".  I looked at her blankly.  ""What do you mean 'good enough?'  Why would I settle for good enough?  I want to be the best mum possible,"" I said.  She kept pressing.  I kept resisting.  I left that session feeling frustrated.  In my opinion, good enough meant not enough.  And why were we wasting valuable time on this when we should be tackling the ""bully in my head"" as I had come to call my anxiety?  I yearned to be better, back to my old self. Everywhere I went, I saw danger.  It was worse at night.  I could almost feel a tangible sense of impending doom.  I knew I wouldn't get more than three or four hours' sleep - the baby suffered from silent reflux and woke every 45 minutes after midnight.  But even the corners of the room seemed darker and more threatening in the evening. At night, trying to stop myself falling asleep mid-feed, I found even more horrors on the internet.  ""The dog ate my baby's head,"" was one particularly unhelpful headline which had me jumping out of bed at four in the morning, running downstairs to shake my husband awake.  ""He's going to get mauled by a dog,"" I cried.  He looked at me uncomprehending, bleary eyed, but I couldn't be calmed until he got out of bed and helped me compose an email to my parents and sister about the family cockapoos. Another news article about baby seats sent shock waves through my core.  Babies shouldn't be kept in their car seats for longer than two hours, it said.  After reading this, nothing my husband said could convince me to take a car journey longer than half an hour, in case the baby asphyxiated en route. ""I am so anxious,"" I confided tearfully in my mother.  She nodded knowingly and said, ""It never goes away, once you're a parent"".  She didn't realise the extent of my anxiety.  I took her words quite literally to mean that I would feel this horrendous for the rest of my life.  The bully would never go away.  I couldn't possibly survive at that level of anxiety. I thought I had made a mistake, that I was not cut out for motherhood.  And then came guilt for not being thankful for my beautiful child. Ironically I embraced the days when I just felt a dull depression rather than racing anxiety - it was a relief. ""This is normal,"" I told myself. ""All mothers feel this and it will pass."" To say I lost myself that first year is no over-exaggeration.  I don't recognise my face in photos, my false smile.  Delirious and headachy from sleep deprivation, sugar became my crutch and I piled on all the weight I'd lost after giving birth.  I didn't get my hair done for more than six months.  Putting on a pair of earrings was too much effort.  Never mind ""good enough"", I was failing miserably at being an alpha mum and I knew everyone would be able to see through the camouflage of makeup so it wasn't worth the effort.  And I was so very tired, all the time.  I hated what was happening to me, and I imagined that my little boy would one day realise he'd drawn the short straw and reject me.  I felt he deserved better than me. The light bulb moment came a few months in, after the ""good enough"" session.  My therapist helped me finally realise that my quest for perfection was fuelling my anxiety.  My core belief in this instance?  That my self worth was measured by how well I could do things.  Before baby, everything from documents at work, to the way my home was decorated, to sourcing a quirky restaurant for dinner with friends, I had put a huge amount of effort into making it as good as possible.  I prided myself on being super-organised. My school friends had a nickname for me - The Guru.  I never missed a birthday.  I loved doing thoughtful things for my friends and family.  My self worth was completely tied up in being this Guru.  Naturally I had wanted to be the best mother possible.  Before having a baby I had all the time in the world to invest in my pursuit of perfection.  But as most new parents discover, you can't control anything about a baby, and it's natural to feel like your life has been turned upside down. What would happen if I just stopped? I listened to my therapist and reluctantly decided to give it a go, settling for ""good enough"" rather than perfection.  The world didn't stop turning.  The house didn't fall down.  I started being kinder and more forgiving of myself.  I scrapped my epic ""to do"" list.  I stopped frantically cleaning the kitchen and making the house presentable when the baby napped. Instead, I would curl up next to him and nap too.  Or I'd relax with a half-hour treat of daytime TV or trashy magazines (""The trashier the better,"" my therapist encouraged).  I ordered takeaways.  I let the dirty washing pile up and ordered myself not to panic about it. Gradually, life got easier.  It felt almost rebellious and sloppy at first, deliberately turning my back on everything I'd strived towards for such a long time.  But I soon realised that nobody noticed these changes apart from me.  My family and friends didn't love me for the things I did, or how well I did them.  They loved me, to quote Bridget Jones, ""Just the way you are"". It was deliriously freeing.  As I stopped fretting about everything being perfect, I started living in the moment - not dwelling on the past or worrying about the future.  Concentrating on one day at a time, I suddenly realised one day that the scary visions and intrusive thoughts were receding. ""You're wearing earrings,"" exclaimed my therapist one week.  I self-consciously touched my ear and smiled.  Somehow it hadn't seemed like such an effort this morning. Like many people, my life has been touched by tragic and traumatic periods, but my first year of motherhood was undoubtedly the toughest time of my life.   I think it is safe to say that I was traumatised afterwards.  It took a huge toll on my husband, too, watching his wife, his best friend, fall apart before his eyes, turning into someone he didn't recognise. Three years later, we felt ready to try for our second baby and I was lucky to fall pregnant quickly.  I was excited but feared I would fall ill again.  The Chelsea and Westminster midwives were really on the ball, though. As soon as I mentioned my previous history during my first check-up, I was referred to the hospital's perinatal service. I met with psychotherapist Danny once a month or so during my pregnancy.  I talked at length about my past experiences and he quickly saw I had convinced myself that the same thing would happen all over again.  Danny reassured me that I had a good support network and that we could act swiftly if I fell unwell.  I also saw the hospital psychiatrist, who strongly recommended anti-depressants if I started feeling down.  My husband, who previously had quite strong opinions on anti-depressants, was in full agreement that this time I should take them if needed. It started so well.  Our baby's birth was calm and without complications.  Another beautiful little boy.  Bringing him home, I felt our little family was complete, and was elated I'd never have to go through pregnancy again.  For the first two weeks I was on a real high - this is what motherhood was meant to feel like.  But then he started showing signs of reflux - coughing and spluttering during feeds, hugely disrupted sleep, grimacing in pain.  I braced myself for a tough few months but knew that we would survive - after all, we'd done it before with his older brother. A month after the baby arrived, we lost my elderly father-in-law when he suffered a bad fall.  My grieving husband had to organise not just a UK funeral but his father's repatriation to Italy, an enormous task which took up all his time.  I developed mastitis.  The baby failed his hearing test, showing signs of hearing loss.  He wasn't putting on weight (due to his struggles with reflux and breastfeeding).  I was diagnosed with a hernia, which needed surgery - and subsequently developed a dangerous infection which required daily visits to hospital.  Our troubles seemed never-ending. I felt massively overwhelmed when left to look after both boys by myself.  I literally couldn't put the baby down because of his reflux, which meant that showering, getting dressed, even going to the bathroom was an issue.  Getting out of the house with both boys felt like planning a mission to Mars.  ""Don't you feel utterly panicked when you need to be somewhere at a certain time?"" I asked a friend, who was a new mum.  ""Well,"" she said, frowning, ""It's a mammoth task, of course, but I wouldn't say I panic.""  I felt self-conscious for over-sharing.  I was convinced I couldn't cope.  What totally passed me by was that everyone struggles.  Looking after babies is hard work, end of story.  But for some reason, I felt I needed to have a handle on it - my need for control creeping back in. Danny came to visit me several times at home and often carried out my therapy sessions while I nursed the baby.  There was no way I could have managed the journey to the hospital in those early days. Both my babies suffered from digestive problems and would scream in discomfort for hours at a time, and both times I cut out cows milk from my diet. But I became obsessive over everything that passed my lips, convinced I was slowly poisoning my baby through my breast milk. At one point, I considered a total elimination diet, eating only pear and lamb, until my mother talked me out of it. One night, staying at my parents' house while my husband was in Italy, I was delirious with exhaustion after two hours trying to settle my miserable screaming baby.  I thought about putting the baby down, walking out the front door and stepping in front of a bus.  Five minutes later I was tearfully apologising to my son, nuzzling his neck, promising I'd never leave him.  I have never had suicidal thoughts and that moment terrified me into action.  In the morning I told my mother how I'd felt.  And after half an hour of arguing with her - I insisted I could get better by myself - I agreed to start taking anti-depressants.  Within a week, I had stopped crying every day - something I hadn't even realised I'd been doing - and the cloud lifted. A year later, I am still on anti-depressants, and still see Danny and the team from the Chelsea and Westminster perinatal service. They've been a godsend. I feel content with being ""good enough"".  I feel no shame about my struggles.  In fact I feel like shouting my story from the rooftops - if only to help other new mothers who feel like I did. I know how lucky I am but I am concerned for the women who aren't, who don't have someone fighting their corner with the GP, who don't have private medical insurance, who don't live in a postcode that provides such excellent services.   In the four years since my first baby, I've noticed a real change in the way people talk about mental health, but I would like to see a real change in the way mothers-to-be are prepared for what might happen, so it doesn't come as such a shock. And if a new mother even breathes a whisper about feeling down, she should be taken deadly seriously - because this can be deadly.  If you feel like I did, you don't have the ""baby blues"", you are unwell and need medical attention, just as you would for a broken leg or the flu. New mothers are vulnerable enough (both physically and mentally) without having to fight to be heard. Becoming a mother is life changing in a way that nobody can prepare for, but what we can prepare for is better support for maternal mental health.

"'Most wanted' man arrested in BarcelonaJamie Acourt had evaded capture for two years by using false identities, police say.2h2 hours agoLondon","Jamie Acourt, pictured in police custody in Spain, faces an extradition hearing One of Britain's most wanted fugitives, Jamie Acourt, has been captured in Spain on suspicion of drug offences. A Spanish police source told the BBC that the 41-year-old from south London had used false identities to evade capture for two years. Mr Acourt, who was wanted by police investigating the large-scale supply of drugs, was arrested in Barcelona on Friday. On Saturday he was remanded in custody by a Spanish high court judge. He appeared in front of the judge in Madrid via video-link from Barcelona. A former suspect inStephen Lawrence's murder in 1993, Mr Acourt has always denied any involvement in the killing. Armed officers detained Mr Acourt after he left the Metropolitan Sagrada Familia Gym in the Spanish city on Friday afternoon. He was arrested as part of operation Captura, a joint effort by the National Crime Agency (NCA), Metropolitan Police and Spanish National Police. A senior Spanish police source told the BBC police believe Mr Acourt had taken ""great care"" and ""plenty of security measures"" to avoid getting caught. ""He had protection. He had help.

The BBC understands from a source at the gym that he had been a member at the one near the Sagrada Familia cathedral for ""a long time"" and he was seen there on a regular basis. Police said he was moving around Spain and spending time in ""places where a tourist could disappear"". Recently, police believe he had been living in Barcelona. The investigation to find him took years and was a close collaboration between Spanish National Police and the NCA. When arrested he told police he was an Italian tourist, according to the source. Jamie Acourt at the 1998 public inquiry into the killing of Stephen Lawrence Mr Acourt was last seen in the UK on 1 February 2016, in the Eltham area and was known to visit south-west London and areas of Surrey. A spokesman for the Met said: ""The European Arrest Warrant was issued as part of the Met's efforts to trace Mr Acourt in relation to an investigation into the unlawful supply of controlled substances. ""This relates to an investigation launched in 2016 by detectives from the Serious and Organised Crime Command. ""Extradition proceedings now await."" Steve Reynolds, the NCA's regional head of international operations, toldRadio 4's Today Programmethat many fugitives ""believe they can hide in plain sight"" among Spain's large British community. Mr Reynolds said Mr Acourt's extradition is likely to take ""days or weeks rather than months"". Mr Acourt will appear at court in Madrid early next week for an extradition hearing.

Police seize Navalny at Putin protestThe opposition leader is detained at a rally in Moscow before the Russian president's inauguration.5m6 minutes agoEurope,"This video can not be played Police seize the opposition leader at a rally in Moscow Riot police have seized Russia's most prominent opposition leader, Alexei Navalny, at a Moscow rally two days before Vladimir Putin's inauguration. He was carried away struggling through the crowd of demonstrators, who had gathered to protest at Mr Putin's forthcoming fourth term in office. The rallies in Moscow and Russia's second city, St Petersburg, were not approved by the authorities. At least 1,000 arrests were reportedly made at rallies across Russia. Early on Sunday, Mr Navalny was released from police custody after being charged with organising a rally and resisting the police. At the rally, protesters on Moscow's Pushkin Square shouted slogans such as ""Down with the tsar!"" - ""tsar"" was the historical title of Russia's pre-revolutionary emperors - and ""Russia without Putin!"". In St Petersburg, Russia's second city, they shouted ""Jail the tsar!"". Activists have been using a Russian hash tag on Twitter which translates as ""He's not our tsar"". The pro-Kremlin National Liberation Movement held a rival rally at the same location in Moscow. Alexei Navalny: Russia's vociferous Putin critic Does Putin's Russia reject the West? The long-time anti-corruption campaigner is not an elected politician but has led protests against the rule of Mr Putin and his allies since the parliamentary election of 2011. Protesters gathered at the Pushkin monument in Moscow He was barred from running for president against Mr Putin this year because of a conviction for embezzlement, which he denies, saying the case against him was  politically motivated. He has been arrested at protests on numerous occasions before, and is typically held for a few weeks before being released. Reports say he was forced to stay at a secret location on Friday night in order to make it to the Moscow rally at all. When the Moscow city authorities warned people of possible ""negative consequences"" of taking part in unsanctioned rallies on Saturday, Mr Navalny tweeted back:""And I would like to warn everyone of the negative consequences of non-participation in the rallies."",external ""If you stay at home, Putin's gang will tear the country apart and deprive you personally of a future,"" he said. Mr Putin was re-elected president with more than 76% of the vote, his best ever election performance. He has effectively ruled Russia since 2000, including a period of four years when he served as prime minister (2008-12). Presidents elected in other countries normally serve a maximum of two terms. Anger at Mr Putin's long hold on power has been compounded by allegations of ballot-rigging at the last and previous presidential elections Widespread irregularities were reported by some international observers at the election in March. Putin rival barred from Russian election Putin basks in election he could not lose According to OVD-Info, a website which monitors arrests, 1,029 arrests were made,externalin 19 cities across Russia, nearly half of them in Moscow. There was some confusion about numbers with one opposition source talking of 50 arrests at an unapproved rally in Krasnoyarsk, western Siberia, and another of ""at least 10"" while OVD-Info counted 35 in the same city. Turnout at the rally in the Russian capital was about 1,500, according to police, but Reuters news agency estimated there were ""several thousand"" people at the event. In a tweet, the mayor of Yekaterinburg, Yevgeny Roizman, estimated a turnout of at least 5,000 in the Urals city. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Has London's murder rate overtaken New York's?,"Police in Chalgrove Road, Tottenham, where a 17-year old girl was shot dead in a drive-by attack Claim:London has overtaken New York for murders for the first time in modern history after a surge in knife crime across the capital. Verdict:A selective use of statistics from the start of 2018 appears to bear this out - but the reality is that New York still appears to be more violent than London. Criminologists and police chiefs love studying the differences and similarities in violence between big cities because the huge amounts of data can give clues as to what works best to keep people safe. There has been no end of comparisons down the decades of London and New York because, on the face of things, the cities are broadly comparable. They're both cosmopolitan ""world cities"" with broadly similar populations of more than 8 million people. They also have big gaps between rich and poor inhabitants. But there has always been one significant difference: the crime rate. So this weekend'sreport,externalin the Sunday Times, which could be interpreted as suggesting that London was now more dangerous than New York, needs some unpicking. And, as you may have come to expect from BBC Reality Check, the truth is a little more complex. New York police have opened 50 murder files so far this year - this compares with 48 in London According to the newspaper, London overtook New York's ""murder rate"" in February ""as the capital endured a dramatic surge in knife crime"". That is true. The New York Police Department dealt with 11 homicides in February - while London's Metropolitan Police opened investigations into 15 deaths. And in March, there were 22 killings in London and one fewer on the other side of the Atlantic. But that grim month-by-month tally is not quite the whole story. The one thing that's always true about statistics is that there will be blips - sudden rises or falls in the data. These two high months for London could ultimately turn out to be outliers. We don't yet know. But older data shows why we should be cautious. In January, for example, the Met investigated eight murders in London. The NYPD looked into 18 killings. And that means that while Scotland Yard has opened 48 homicide inquiries so far this year, New York has in fact opened 50 murder files. Looking at 2017, the homicide rate per 100,000 population stood at 1.2 in London and 3.4 in New York. While the difference between the two cities has definitely narrowed - the trend is far from fixed. And even older figures are also quite revealing. In 2007, New York witnessed 496 homicides. That was three times more than in London. Last year, the American city suffered 292 killings and London 130. The rate of killings so far this year in London is higher than it was during the same period last year. The fatalities include five shootings and 31 stabbings. Nine of those killed were teenagers and crimes involving knives and sharp instruments across England and Wales are at their highest level since 2011. Why the rate is going up in London, so far this year, is unclear. There's a push for police to stop and search more suspects for weapons after a big fall in the use of the power since 2010. But New York police have also reduced their use of similar powers over the same period - and their murder rate has fallen. New York is definitely a much safer place than in 1990 when there were 2,262 murders. But it's not remotely clear yet that London is becoming more murderous than its American cousin.

Simba the cat turns up near lion enclosure,"Simba (left) was named after a cartoon film lion cub A cat named after the Lion King film character Simba has been found seven months after going missing - near Colchester Zoo's big cats enclosure. The tabby was spotted trying to catch birds of prey close to the lion house. Owner Raymond Bateman thinks his pet had been living at the zoo, four miles from home, for at least a month, asthe Colchester Gazette reported,external. He said the cat disappeared after they began building an extension, as it was not feeling the love for the noise. The family pet had always been shy and frightened of visitors, so the disruption caused by the builders was a bit much for the sensitive moggy, and it left. Simba was shy and did not usually like noise or strangers, its owner said The Batemans put up posters but there were no real sightings of the five-year-old microchipped puss, ""although someone did say they saw a cat at Colchester Zoo a couple of months ago,"" Mr Bateman told the BBC. The zoo is a favourite place for the family to visit, but they had never taken their cat there. However, Simba seemed keen to live up to its name and mix with the other kings of the cat world. ""We got a call from the zoo on Thursday to say he had been seen hanging around the birds of prey, trying to catch them close to the lion enclosure,"" said Mr Bateman. The cat was scanned and returned home. Zoo curator, Clive Barwick, said for some time staff had been ""aware of Simba's presence but he had always steered himself away from direct contact with anyone that approached him"", but they were ""delighted"" to have found his owner. Mr Bateman said: ""He's got a few scratches on his nose and ears, and was like a different cat when he came back. ""For a while he was very brave, but now he's settled into his old ways, hiding under the bed if anyone comes round.""

Stoke City 1-2 Crystal Palace,"Patrick van Aanholt's goal denied Stoke a draw that would have kept alive their survival hopes until at least later on Saturday Stoke's 10-year stay in the Premier League has come to an end after they were relegated to the Championship by Crystal Palace's second-half resurgence. Home fans streamed out of the Bet365 Stadium immediately after Patrick van Aanholt's winner, with long-time chairman Peter Coates looking on miserably. The afternoon had started far better for the hosts. Manager Paul Lambert - appointed in January to turn the Potters around -  had celebrated wildly with Xherdan Shaqiri after the midfielder's free-kick opened the scoring just before the break. But James McArthur skipped clear down the left and side-footed home the leveller, before Van Aanholt pounced on Ryan Shawcross' under-hit backpass to consign Stoke to the second tier. Patrick van Aanholt commiserated with Stoke after scoring the winner that condemned them to the second tier... ...a gesture appreciated by the hosts The Potters' players - who finished 13th last season - collapsed to the turf as a first top-flight relegation since 1985 sank in. Crystal Palace's Mamadou Sakho was one of a number of visiting players to console their opponents after the final whistle, with goalkeeper Jack Butland in tears as some of the remaining home supporters defiantly chanted their lifelong allegiance to the club. Reaction: Stoke too big to stay down - Lambert Xherdan Shaqiri signed for Â£12m from Inter Milan in 2015 Before kick-off, a fan implored the rest of the Bet365 Stadium to do ""whatever it takes"" for victory over the public address system. The crowd responded with incessant noise, but - for the vast majority of the match - the Stoke attack was too quiet. As so often, it was only when Shaqiri got on the ball that the hosts looked able to unpick the opposition defence. The Switzerland international's cross was headed weakly wide by Mame Biram Diouf in Stoke's best chance before his free-kick found the net with the game's first shot on target. The 26-year-old's pass should have put Badou Ndiaye clean through on goal in the second half, but the Senegal midfielder miscontrolled when a settling second goal beckoned for Stoke. Shaqiri has spoken this season ofa ""lack of quality"" among his team-mates,externaland was planning talks with the Stoke management in the summer regardless of whether the club had stayed up. Formerly of Inter Milan and Bayern Munich, he will surely be playing top-flight football somewhere next season, with the likes of England international Butland and Wales midfielder Joe Allen also likely to exit. All the reaction after Stoke are relegated Peter Coates (centre) was joined in the executive seats by Stoke legend Gordon Banks (in red tie) Stoke's demise is even more damning on those who do not share the teamsheet with Shaqiri. Record signing Giannelli Imbula has spent the campaign on loan at French strugglers Toulouse. Defender Kevin Wimmer, bought last summer for Â£18m, has been dropped down to the club's under-23 side, where he is joined by out-of-favour Â£12m striker Saido Berahino. Lambert's midfield options on the bench consisted of the ageing trio of Darren Fletcher, Charlie Adam and Stephen Ireland. The club have not lacked for funds from Coates, but too many of their big-money purchases have been missing in inaction. How it looks at the bottom of the Premier League Roy Hodgson took charge after Palace's owners called time on Frank de Boer's short tenure at the club It was a result that mathematically confirmed Crystal Palace's place in the Premier League next season, even if survival had become increasingly clear through an unbeaten April. Considering the visitors' start to the season, it will also ensure an almighty final-day party at the always-boisterous Selhurst Park. Palace lost their first seven league matches this season without scoring a single goal. The appointment of Roy Hodgson in September was greeted with doubts by many whose most recent memory of the 70-year-old was leading England's calamitous Euro 2016 campaign. But he has shored up the Eagles' defence while, less predictably, giving the likes of Wilfried Zaha and Ruben Loftus-Cheek the freedom to pose a threat at the opposite end. In the final, wide-open exchanges, the visitors looked more likely to add to the scoreline than the hosts salvage their survival chances. McArthur knitted together the visitors' midfield, scored the goal that turned the game and recorded the joint-highest passing accuracy in the Stoke half of any Palace starter Stoke manager Paul Lambert, speaking to Sky Sports:""It is a tough afternoon. I am feeling for everyone connected with the club. ""When teams don't get results you can be sleep-walking into positions you don't want to be in. We never had enough. Since I came in the lads have given everything, but we came short. It is a chance to rebuild. ""It is difficult to come in mid-January to try to assess the team and I had a chat with the players on what went wrong. ""No-one can point a finger at the effort of the players."" This video can not be played Stoke have to bounce back up - Lambert Crystal Palace manager Roy Hodgson:""After seven games, or after 11 games with four points, I never saw it coming. ""I was hoping it would be a low-scoring year in terms of points for the lower sides and we'd just scrape over the line. ""But we came here basically safe. I couldn't see us going down with 38 points, so I think it was a great show of character from us to come here and play really well. ""It's not easy having that euphoria from last week and then to come to a place like this, where they're fighting for their lives, and put on a performance like we did."" This video can not be played Hodgson sympathises with relegated Stoke after Palace win Crystal Palace are the first top-flight team since Liverpool in the 1899-1900 season to avoid relegation despite losing their first seven matches of the season. Since beating Huddersfield in his first Premier League match in charge, the Potters have collected just seven points from 13 games under Lambert. Crystal Palace have not lost any of their past 13 Premier League games against sides starting the day in the bottom half of the division, winning eight. Of players with at least 15 Premier League goals, no player has scored a higher percentage from outside the box than Shaqiri (67%, level with former Newcastle and Tottenham winger David Ginola). Stoke have failed to win any of the four Premier League matches they have been leading at half-time under Lambert.

Breast screening 'more harmful than good',"Routine breast cancer screening can do ""more harm than good"" and women who missed appointments should ""carry on with their lives"", doctors have said. A group of 15 health experts have written tothe Times,,externalsaying women must not be subjected to ""fear-mongering"". It comes after450,000 women in England were not invited for routine screeningbecause of a computer error. Breast cancer charities say the screening programme offers women the ""best chance"" of early detection. In the letter to the newspaper, the group of academics and GPs say women aged 70-79 who are being offered catch-up appointments should only seek help if they notice a lump or other symptoms. ""[They] would be well advised to look this gift horse in the mouth,"" the medical professionals wrote in the newspaper. ""The breast screening programme mostly causes more unintended harm than good, which is slowly being recognised internationally. ""Many women and doctors now avoid breast screening because it has no impact on all-cause death."" The claims of lives saved because of breast screening are counteracted by deaths resulting from interventions, the medics said. And the most dangerous and advanced cancers are not prevented by screening programmes, they said. Is the NHS programme working? Breast screening: What went wrong? Thousands of calls made to breast screen error helpline The lemon-aid to breast cancer signs Why isn't breast cancer screening totally reliable? The letter added: ""Although counter-intuitive, catching some things that look like cancer down a microscope (before it exists) can be too early and unnecessary."" Among those who have signed the letter are Susan Bewley, professor of women's health at King's College London, and Michael Baum, professor emeritus of surgery at University College London. The error, which dated back to 2009, was revealed earlier this week. Up to 270 women in England may have died because they did not receive invitations to screening. The 309,000 women affected - those who are still alive - will be contacted by letter by the end of May, with the offer of catch-up mammograms. The NHSestimates that its screening programme saves about one life for every 200 womenwho are scanned for breast cancer, adding up to about 1,300 lives saved each year in the UK. But about three in every 200 women screened are diagnosed with a cancer that would never have become life-threatening, equating to about 4,000 women each year being offered unnecessary treatment. Retired nurse Maggie Whyte, 61, from Edinburgh discovered she had stage one breast cancer when she went for a routine mammogram last year. ""I was lucky as it hadn't spread to my lymph nodes,"" she said. The treatment she underwent - a lumpectomy and radiotherapy - was successful. ""It could have been so different,"" she said. ""Another three years, I don't know what would have happened. ""How dare they say screening is no good? I am so grateful to have my health."" Fiona Hazell, of charity Breast Cancer Now, said it is ""absolutely right"" that PHE is offering catch-up appointments. The screening programme is the ""best chance"" of breast cancer being detected at an ""early, more treatable stage"", Ms Hazell said. Dr Emma Pennery, clinical director at Breast Cancer Care, agreed that screening ""remains our best tool"" for detecting breast cancer early, but added: ""There are two sides to the coin and it's estimated that for every life saved, three women will have unnecessary treatment."" She added it is ""crucial"" that every woman eligible is offered screening and is given information about risks and benefits to make their own choice. This video can not be played Helen has been affected and says ""People at the top need to admit to the problem"" Meanwhile, Sara Hiom at Cancer Research UK, said women can be ""reassured"" that the impact of the error is ""likely to be significantly less than the worst-case scenario predictions"". ""Screening has harms as well as benefits and, while an unknown number of women will have missed the opportunity to have their breast cancer diagnosed earlier by screening, others will have avoided treatment that would not have extended their lives,"" she said. ""It's also helpful to remember that 72% of breast cancers are diagnosed by women finding a lump or noticing other symptoms themselves, so screening is not the only way of discovering something is wrong."" Breast cancer screening is automatically offered once every three years to women aged 50 to 70 in the UK. Public Health England (PHE) says it was not aware of the national problem with the screening programme until January. On Saturday, PHE said it would make further support available to women aged over 72 so they can understand the potential benefits and harms of screening later in life. Dr Jenny Harries, PHE's deputy medical director, said: ""All of our actions are based on the best available clinical advice... ""We are aware of the debate and evidence of screening in older women and we know it can lead to over-diagnosis, which is why we have published a new advice leaflet specially for women over 70."" Announcing the computer error earlier this week,Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt acknowledged there,externalis ""currently no clinical consensus about the benefits of screening"" for the 68-71 age group.

Woman 'critical' after drill attack,"This video can not be played Corey French talked to the woman attacked with a drill in Strabane, minutes before the incident. A 38-year-old woman is in a critical but stable condition after being attacked with a cordless drill in Strabane, County Tyrone. The incident happened in the Railway Street area at about 02:00 BST on Saturday morning. Police said a 17-year-old boy was being questioned by detectives. They said the ""victim sustained a very serious head injury"" and they were ""exploring a possible homophobic motive for the crime"". They have appealed for information and video footage of the incident. Det Sgt Brian Reid said: ""This was a brutal attack and the injuries sustained by the victim are extremely grave."" Police said the attack happened at Railway Street at about 02:00 BST on Saturday morning SDLP assembly member for West Tyrone, Daniel McCrossan, said it was ""one of the most horrific incidents"" he had learned of during his time as a politician. ""It is a monstrous attack and one that has sent shockwaves across the entirety of the wider Strabane community today,"" he added. ""I actually felt sick, that this could happen."" Forensic officers at the scene of the attack Ulster Unionist councillor Chris Smyth said the attack was ""despicable"". ""This was an absolutely brutal attack. It is hard to comprehend what goes through an individual's head that they would attack a woman with a drill,"" he said.

Women allowed into Japan bullfight ring,"No bull is killed in Japanese bullfighting A woman has been allowed to enter a Japanese traditional bullfighting ring for the first time after a ban was lifted in a bid to modernise the sport. Yuki Araki accompanied her animal on the opening day of the season in Niigata's Yamakoshi district. Women had previously been banned once the ring was deemed to have been purified with salt and rice wine. Japanese bullfighting, known as ""togyu"", differs from the Spanish version in that no bull is killed. Instead two of the animals lock horns and attempt to push each other back. The bulls have coaches to encourage them and the fight is over if one gores the other. There is no bullfighter in the centuries-old sport. Sumo wrestling's growing sexism problem When Japan's women broke their silence Bullfighting officials said the move was necessary for the sport to appeal to the #MeToo generation. In recent months Japanese women have spoken out about sexual harassment. Twotop officials subsequently resigned over sex scandals. ""Equality for men and women is a trend of the times,"" said Katsushi Seki, an official with the Yamakoshi bullfight organisation. ""By opening the ring to women, we hope this traditional bullfighting will continue far into the future,"" he told AFP. The ring had been regarded as a pure space forbidden to women The move to lift the ban on women also follows an incident in a sumo wrestling ring last month wherewomen performing first aid on a man who had collapsed were ordered by a referee to leavebecause women were banned from the space. The women ran into the ring when the mayor of the central city of Maizuru, Ryozo Tatami, became ill while giving a speech. Traditionally seen as ""impure"", women are not allowed into sumo rings, which are regarded as sacred. Inside the scandal-hit world of sumo Mongolian girl grappling with sumo world The head of Japan's sumo association later apologised to the women.

"TSB fiasco: 'Our 24 hours of moving chaos'The Jones' belongings were packed to go, but TSB's computer fiasco put their move in doubt.","Chris and Sally Jones spent 24 hours fearing they could be left stranded TSB's reputation will depend on how it compensates customers for the distress and inconvenience caused by its IT fiasco, an expert has said. Richard Lloyd, chairman of complaints service Resolver, said the bank would be ""in big trouble"" if it failed with customers' less tangible losses. A perfect illustration is the case of the Jones family - TSB mortgage-holders - who were expecting to move house. For 24 hours they faced the prospect of having to move to a hotel instead. The migration of data on TSB's five million customers from former owner Lloyds' IT system to a new one managed by Sabadell has led to nearly two weeks of difficulties for the bank and more than 40,000 customer complaints so far. TSB boss Paul Pester to give up Â£2m bonus amid IT mess How it all went so wrong for TSB Mother-of-two Sally Jones, 40, said their saga began with a concerned call from their solicitor on Wednesday afternoon - the day before the family were expecting to move to their new home in south London. The solicitor explained that, for no apparent reason, a new account number could not be uploaded on to TSB's new IT system, so funds might not be released for their house purchase. At exactly the same time, TSB chief executive Paul Pester was telling MPs that the ""underlying engine"" of the bank was working well. A sleepless night followed, before the removals van arrived early on Thursday, and their belongings were loaded up. Their daughters - Hannah, six, and Sophie, three - were despatched to school and nursery. Then, their moving day stress became even more acute. ""The TSB staff were being as helpful as possible, but they were hampered by the terrible IT mess. It was a ridiculous situation to be in. We were in limbo,"" she said. As the day went on they started to call hotels. Decorators were expecting to arrive the next day, and the removals company said the next available slot for delivering their belongings was after the bank holiday. First they sat outside their new home waiting for the money to come through. Then, powerless to do anything, the couple's wait continued in the pub. Eventually, with the clock ticking the call came through that the TSB computer had at last said ""yes"". They could finally pick up the keys and move into their new home. Mrs Jones said they would complain, but the extra stress will be difficult to quantify in terms of compensation. TSB has said that no customers will be left out of pocket, and it has called in accountancy firm Deloitte to devise a system of redress for customers. ""I do not think that is going to make consumers feel particularly confident that they are going to be treated fairly,"" said Mr Lloyd, of Resolver. He said that there were no clear industry rules on what kind of compensation should be agreed for stress and inconvenience. ""How TSB deals with this will be as important to their reputation in the future as the meltdown itself,"" he told Radio 4's Today programme. ""If they do not deal with this less tangible loss properly and fairly then they will be in big trouble."" He suggested that anyone affected should document what had happened, and consider taking a case to the financial ombudsman if they were unhappy with how TSB dealt with their complaint. TSB apologised and promised the couple would not be left out of pocket. A spokesperson said: ""We're really sorry for the experience Mr and Mrs Jones have had whilst moving home and the inconvenience this has caused them. ""This isn't the level of service that we pride ourselves on providing, and isn't what our customers have come to expect from TSB. We have reached out to Mr and Mrs Jones, and we will ensure that they are not left out of pocket.""

No clear winner in final election result,"No clear party winner has emerged following Thursday's local elections in England. As the final election result was declared in the London borough of Tower Hamlets overnight, Labour sealed their best result in the capital since 1971. But their failure to secure key targets such as Wandsworth saw Theresa May claiming ""success"" for the Tories. ""We have to do better if we're going to be in government,"" said Lady Smith, Labour's leader in the House of Lords. ""Not much went wrong, but not as much went as well as we'd have liked,"" she told BBC's Newsnight. The results in full Analysis suggested the two main parties were neck and neck overall in terms of national vote share - on 35% each. Last year Labour's vote share was estimated to be narrowly ahead of the Tories. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he was ""disappointed at any places where we lost a bit of ground"". However, he insisted it was a ""solid set of results"" which left the party ""well placed to fight and win the next general election"". This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: ""There's much more to come and it's going to get even better"" BBC political correspondent Chris Mason said neither Labour nor the Tories could claim a ""substantial breakthrough"". ""But while the overriding sentiment among Conservatives is one of relief, within Labour, it's introspection,"" our correspondent said. Laura Kuenssberg: Parties must break out of comfort zones Sir John Curtice: How important was Brexit? UKIP official compares party to the Black Death The Conservatives are widely seen to have benefitted from the collapse of the UKIP vote - prompting leading Brexiters such as Boris Johnson and Iain Duncan Smith to urge the prime minister to press on with plans for a clean break with the EU. According to the BBC's projected national vote share, the Conservative party is three points down on what it achieved in 2017's county council elections but, after eight years in government, it is better than its performance in any of the local elections held between 2012 and 2014 and in 2016. This video can not be played Theresa May hails Tory campaigners in Wandsworth The party saw a small swing in their favour outside the capital and clung on to key London boroughs including Westminster, Wandsworth and Kensington & Chelsea - despite Labour ambitions. Mrs May praised Tory councillors after winning Basildon, Peterborough and Barnet. The final council to be declared was Tower Hamlets, which was gained by Labour from no overall control. With all councils declared, Labour won 2,350 seats, up 77, the Conservatives won 1,332, down 33, the Lib Dems won 536, up 75, the Greens won 39, up eight and UKIP won three, down 123. The Conservativesgained the London council of Barnetfrom no overall control, and held their flagship London councils of Westminster and Wandsworth. They also won Basildon and Peterborough, which had both also been under no overall control. But they havelost control of their northern flagship Trafford Councilafter 14 years of Conservative rule. Labour had high hopes for the night, and havewon Plymouth from the Toriesand gained Kirklees from no overall control butlost Nuneaton and BedworthandDerby. The Lib Dems have gained four councils, winning neighbouringKingston-upon-ThamesandRichmond-upon-Thamesin Greater London andSouth Cambridgeshirefrom the Tories andThree Riversfrom no overall control. The Greenshave gained seats- taking some from Labour in Sheffield and from the Tories in Richmond upon Thames. UKIP, which performed strongly last time most of the seats were fought in 2014,has seen its vote collapse. It had just three councillors elected, after losing 123. Sinn FÃ©inhas won the Westminster by-election in West Tyrone. Labour MP Dan Jarvis has beenelected mayor of the Sheffield City Region.     But the Tory triumph in Barnet was largely attributed to Mr Corbyn's failure to deal with anti-Semitism within his party - and saw a further flurry of criticism from Labour MPs. Deputy leader Tom Watson acknowledged the Jewish community had ""sent us a message"" and said the party had to learn lessons when it came to dealing with anti-Semitism in its own ranks. Shadow justice secretary Richard Burgon denied that Mr Corbyn's response to Syria and the poisoning of the Russian spy in Salisbury were issues on the doorstep for traditional Labour voters. In his experience of doorknocking in these elections, it was ""very rare"" for the public to raise Mr Corbyn's leadership in a negative way, he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Backbencher Jess Phillips said the party had to look at what had gone wrong in white working class areas in northern England, while Chuka Umunna called for an internal inquiry into the party's campaign, to look at why expected gains hadn't materialised. Mr Umunna said the government was ""divided and incompetent"" yet Labour had not seen ""the big win in Wandsworth or Kensington that was expected"". This video can not be played Professor Sir John Curtice on three things we learnt from the local election results Alastair Campbell, Tony Blair's former director of communications - and well-known critic of Mr Corbyn - said Labour should be destroying the Conservatives given the ""disastrous Brexit negotiations"" and ""serial incompetence"" in the government. The results were bad, he told the Today programme. ""You do not get into a winning position by being in denial,"" he added. The election was seen as a bloodbath for UKIP, which lost dozens of councillors - andits own general secretary compared the party with the Black Death. But the Liberal Democrats enjoyed success as it gained control of four extra councils, winning back Kingston-upon-Thames - which they lost to the Tories four years ago - as well as neighbouring Richmond. The party also gained control of Three Rivers, south-west Hertfordshire, which had been under no overall control and has won South Cambridgeshire from the Tories. Party leader Sir Vince Cable said was ""the beginning of the comeback of the Lib Dems"", but warned: ""It's not going to happen overnight - Rome wasn't built in a day.""

Nasa probe blasts off to study Mars quakes,"This video can not be played Nasa's InSight rocket takes off for Mars The American space agency Nasa has launched its latest mission to Mars. InSight,externalwill be the first probe to focus its investigations predominantly on the interior of the Red Planet. The lander - due to touch down in November - will put seismometers on the surface to feel for ""Marsquakes"". These tremors should reveal how the underground rock is layered - data that can be compared with Earth to shed further light on the formation of the planets 4.6 billion years ago. ""As seismic waves travel through [Mars] they pick up information along the way; as they travel through different rocks,"" explained Dr Bruce Banerdt, InSight's principal investigator. ""And all those wiggles you see on seismograms - scientists understand how to pull that information out. After we've gotten many, many Marsquakes from different directions, we can put together a three dimensional view of the inside of Mars."" Thick fog did not affect the launch on an Atlas rocket from the Vandenberg Air Force Base in California at 04:05 local time (12:05 BST) on Saturday. Mars mission: Ready to rumble InSight: A look inside Mars Nasa last sent seismometers to the Red Planet on the Viking landers in the 1970s. But these missions failed to detect ground vibrations because the instruments were positioned on the body of the probes. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

All they recorded was the landers' shaking as the wind whistled by. InSight, by contrast, is going to place its seismometers directly in the Martian dirt. How many quakes will be detected over the course of a year is uncertain, but estimates suggest perhaps a couple of dozen. They are likely to be small - probably well less than a Magnitude 3, which many people on Earth would sleep through. However, even these gentler signals will carry sufficient information about the subsurface to allow scientists to construct a model of Mars' depths and composition. InSight will have to endure 'seven minutes of terror' when it lands on Mars The planet should have a metal core, a dense mantle and a lighter crust - but where precisely the boundaries lie is speculative. The seismometer experiment is French-led. The European nation has provided the broadband sensors that will detect low-frequency vibrations of the ground, while the UK has contributed a trio of microseismometers, about the size of a pound coin, that will go after the higher frequencies. This video can not be played Tom Pike: The relationship between life and a planet's interior is profound A good source of these short period vibrations is likely to be meteorite impacts. The Franco-British systems should be able to locate the origin of quakes to within a few hundred km. ""The pattern of Marsquakes is going to be very important,"" said Prof Tom Pike from Imperial College London. ""On Earth, earthquakes are very much aligned with the edge of tectonic plates. ""We don't think that plate tectonics is active on Mars but we fundamentally don't know at the moment, and so just seeing the pattern of seismicity that comes in - that's going to be just a critical bit of information in and of itself."" Agencies aim to bring back Mars rocks Europe's Mars rover takes shape Researchers believe Mars once had a liquid core, as evidenced by the magnetism this generated and which is still retained in many of the planet's rocks. Whether any of that ancient fluid persists is something InSight will test by using radio equipment to observe how Mars shifts on its axis of rotation. This video can not be played Suzanne Smrekar: The Viking seismometers recorded the landers wobbling in the wind ""If you take a raw egg and a cooked egg and you spin them, they wobble differently because of the distribution of liquid in the interior,"" explained InSight's deputy project scientist, Dr Suzanne Smrekar. ""So by tracking our spacecraft very precisely, we're able to see how Mars wobbles and that really tells us a lot of information about the core of Mars."" For those who recall the ill-fated Beagle Mars lander from 2003, there will be interest in the heat probe InSight plans to deploy. This incorporates a hammer to dig itself up to 5m into the ground. The technology, from Germany, has heritage in the ""mole"" designed for Beagle. InSight's heat probe will provide information on how much energy inside Mars is available to drive changes at the surface. InSight now has a six-month cruise before landing on 26 November. As ever, getting down in one piece will not be easy. Like all surface missions before it, InSight will have to endure the ""seven minutes of terror"" - the time it takes for a spacecraft entering the top of Mars' atmosphere at 6km/s to slow itself to a standstill at the touchdown point. InSight will enter the top of Mars' atmosphere at almost 6km/s Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk,externaland follow me on Twitter:@BBCAmos,external Mars mission: Ready to rumble InSight: A look inside Mars Death toll rises amid most destructive wildfire in Los Angeles' history Moment friends abandon house as Palisades fire closes in 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Chris Mason: Is Starmer leaving the door open to an abuse inquiry?

Nasa mission to target 'Marsquakes',"This video can not be played Nasa's InSight rocket takes off for Mars The American space agency Nasa has launched its latest mission to Mars. InSight,externalwill be the first probe to focus its investigations predominantly on the interior of the Red Planet. The lander - due to touch down in November - will put seismometers on the surface to feel for ""Marsquakes"". These tremors should reveal how the underground rock is layered - data that can be compared with Earth to shed further light on the formation of the planets 4.6 billion years ago. ""As seismic waves travel through [Mars] they pick up information along the way; as they travel through different rocks,"" explained Dr Bruce Banerdt, InSight's principal investigator. ""And all those wiggles you see on seismograms - scientists understand how to pull that information out. After we've gotten many, many Marsquakes from different directions, we can put together a three dimensional view of the inside of Mars."" Thick fog did not affect the launch on an Atlas rocket from the Vandenberg Air Force Base in California at 04:05 local time (12:05 BST) on Saturday. Mars mission: Ready to rumble InSight: A look inside Mars Nasa last sent seismometers to the Red Planet on the Viking landers in the 1970s. But these missions failed to detect ground vibrations because the instruments were positioned on the body of the probes. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

All they recorded was the landers' shaking as the wind whistled by. InSight, by contrast, is going to place its seismometers directly in the Martian dirt. How many quakes will be detected over the course of a year is uncertain, but estimates suggest perhaps a couple of dozen. They are likely to be small - probably well less than a Magnitude 3, which many people on Earth would sleep through. However, even these gentler signals will carry sufficient information about the subsurface to allow scientists to construct a model of Mars' depths and composition. InSight will have to endure 'seven minutes of terror' when it lands on Mars The planet should have a metal core, a dense mantle and a lighter crust - but where precisely the boundaries lie is speculative. The seismometer experiment is French-led. The European nation has provided the broadband sensors that will detect low-frequency vibrations of the ground, while the UK has contributed a trio of microseismometers, about the size of a pound coin, that will go after the higher frequencies. This video can not be played Tom Pike: The relationship between life and a planet's interior is profound A good source of these short period vibrations is likely to be meteorite impacts. The Franco-British systems should be able to locate the origin of quakes to within a few hundred km. ""The pattern of Marsquakes is going to be very important,"" said Prof Tom Pike from Imperial College London. ""On Earth, earthquakes are very much aligned with the edge of tectonic plates. ""We don't think that plate tectonics is active on Mars but we fundamentally don't know at the moment, and so just seeing the pattern of seismicity that comes in - that's going to be just a critical bit of information in and of itself."" Agencies aim to bring back Mars rocks Europe's Mars rover takes shape Researchers believe Mars once had a liquid core, as evidenced by the magnetism this generated and which is still retained in many of the planet's rocks. Whether any of that ancient fluid persists is something InSight will test by using radio equipment to observe how Mars shifts on its axis of rotation. This video can not be played Suzanne Smrekar: The Viking seismometers recorded the landers wobbling in the wind ""If you take a raw egg and a cooked egg and you spin them, they wobble differently because of the distribution of liquid in the interior,"" explained InSight's deputy project scientist, Dr Suzanne Smrekar. ""So by tracking our spacecraft very precisely, we're able to see how Mars wobbles and that really tells us a lot of information about the core of Mars."" For those who recall the ill-fated Beagle Mars lander from 2003, there will be interest in the heat probe InSight plans to deploy. This incorporates a hammer to dig itself up to 5m into the ground. The technology, from Germany, has heritage in the ""mole"" designed for Beagle. InSight's heat probe will provide information on how much energy inside Mars is available to drive changes at the surface. InSight now has a six-month cruise before landing on 26 November. As ever, getting down in one piece will not be easy. Like all surface missions before it, InSight will have to endure the ""seven minutes of terror"" - the time it takes for a spacecraft entering the top of Mars' atmosphere at 6km/s to slow itself to a standstill at the touchdown point. InSight will enter the top of Mars' atmosphere at almost 6km/s Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk,externaland follow me on Twitter:@BBCAmos,external Mars mission: Ready to rumble InSight: A look inside Mars Death toll rises amid most destructive wildfire in Los Angeles' history Moment friends abandon house as Palisades fire closes in 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Chris Mason: Is Starmer leaving the door open to an abuse inquiry?

Clinics for recalled patients to begin,"More than 2,500 patients have been recalled following a case review by the Belfast Health and Social Care Trust Two hundred special clinics to review patients of neurology consultant Dr Michael Watt began on Saturday. More than 2,500 of Dr Watt's patients have beenrecalled following a case reviewby the Belfast Health and Social Care Trust. It comes amid concernssome patients may have been misdiagnosed. The patients had attended Dr Watt's clinics at the Royal Victoria Hospital and privately at the Ulster Independent Clinic and Hillsborough Private Clinic. It is the biggest ever patient recall in the Belfast Health Trust. The clinics will be taking place over the next 12 weeks. In a statement,the Ulster Independent Clinic said that as an independent clinical practitioner who used its facilities, ""Dr Watt retains his own patient records"". It said it has sought advice ""on obtaining access to the information required from these files urgently to allow us to accurately identify any patients who may need to be contacted"". ""We are acutely aware of the seriousness of this situation and the anxiety it is causing many patients and their families,"" it said. ""As we focus on identifying those private patients who may need to be contacted in light of the concerns raised, we would like to reassure any of Dr Watt's patients, potentially impacted by this issue, that we are moving as quickly as possible to alleviate their concerns.""

US Navy resurrects Atlantic fleet,"The Second Fleet will be based at its former home - Norfolk, Virginia The US Navy has said it will re-establish its Second Fleet, as Russia becomes more assertive. Chief of Naval Operations Adm John Richardson said the fleet, disbanded in 2011, would oversee forces on the US East Coast and North Atlantic. He said the National Defense Strategy, published earlier this year, made it clear that the era of great power competition had returned. The strategy makes countering Russia and China a priority. The fleet, which was disbanded for cost-saving and structural reasons, will be based in its previous home - Norfolk, Virginia. ""Our National Defense Strategy makes clear that we're back in an era of great power competition as the security environment continues to grow more challenging and complex,"" Adm Richardson said in an announcement on board the USS George H W Bush at Norfolk. ""That's why today, we're standing up Second Fleet to address these changes, particularly in the north Atlantic."" US-Russia at dangerous low, Trump says Putin nuclear slideshow echoes Cold War By Jonathan Marcus, defence and diplomatic correspondent The re-establishment of the US Second Fleet is part of a wider strategy of re-orientating the US armed forces towards a world of renewed big power competition and away from the counter-insurgency campaigns they have been fighting over recent decades. In this case the focus is Russia - a response to its stepped up naval activity of recent years. The new headquarters will give more coherent command arrangements for US warships operating in the Atlantic. Nato is also planning to set up a new Joint Forces Command covering much the same region - the Americans have offered to host this in Norfolk, Virginia. The existing pattern of US naval operations is also due to change significantly. US Defence Secretary James Mattis insists that he wants less predictable deployments, of shorter duration. Experts say a carrier strike group is likely to be deployed more frequently in European waters. Adm Richardson added that the fleet would ""exercise operational and administrative authority over assigned ships, aircraft and landing forces"". The headquarters staff would begin with just 15 personnel, increasing to more than 200. It has not yet been decided who will command the fleet and what assets it will include. Norfolk has also been proposed as a host for the new Nato Joint Force Command for the Atlantic. Nato officials say Russia has increased naval patrols in the Baltic Sea, the North Atlantic and the Arctic, and its submarine activity is at its highest level since the Cold War. Relations between Russia and the West have deteriorated in recent months amid allegations of Russian meddling in US elections, Moscow's support for President Bashar al-Assad of Syria and the poisoning of former spy Sergei Skripal, for which the UK blames Russia. Formed as Second Task Fleet after World War Two Redesignated as Second Fleet in 1950 to support Nato Responsible for 17m sq km (6.7m sq miles) of the North Atlantic Before 2011 oversaw 126 ships, 4,500 aircraft and 90,000 personnel Putin nuclear slideshow echoes Cold War Russian jet 'flew close to US plane' US Navy video captures Russian flyby.

"'Most wanted' man arrested in BarcelonaJamie Acourt, a former Stephen Lawrence murder suspect, is held in Spain on suspicion of drug offences.1han hour agoLondon","Jamie Acourt, pictured in police custody in Spain, faces an extradition hearing One of Britain's most wanted fugitives, Jamie Acourt, has been captured in Spain on suspicion of drug offences. A Spanish police source told the BBC that the 41-year-old from south London had used false identities to evade capture for two years. Mr Acourt, who was wanted by police investigating the large-scale supply of drugs, was arrested in Barcelona on Friday. On Saturday he was remanded in custody by a Spanish high court judge. He appeared in front of the judge in Madrid via video-link from Barcelona. A former suspect inStephen Lawrence's murder in 1993, Mr Acourt has always denied any involvement in the killing. Armed officers detained Mr Acourt after he left the Metropolitan Sagrada Familia Gym in the Spanish city on Friday afternoon. He was arrested as part of operation Captura, a joint effort by the National Crime Agency (NCA), Metropolitan Police and Spanish National Police. A senior Spanish police source told the BBC police believe Mr Acourt had taken ""great care"" and ""plenty of security measures"" to avoid getting caught. ""He had protection. He had help. He didn't live a normal, relaxing life. He was using false identities, false names,"" the source said. This video can not be played Jamie Acourt was led away in handcuffs from a gym in Barcelona, witness Simon McDonald told the BBC's Tom Burridge Police believe Mr Acourt was using four or five different branches of the Metropolitan chain of gyms in Barcelona. The BBC understands from a source at the gym that he had been a member at the one near the Sagrada Familia cathedral for ""a long time"" and he was seen there on a regular basis. Police said he was moving around Spain and spending time in ""places where a tourist could disappear"". Recently, police believe he had been living in Barcelona. The investigation to find him took years and was a close collaboration between Spanish National Police and the NCA. When arrested he told police he was an Italian tourist, according to the source. Jamie Acourt at the 1998 public inquiry into the killing of Stephen Lawrence Mr Acourt was last seen in the UK on 1 February 2016, in the Eltham area and was known to visit south-west London and areas of Surrey. A spokesman for the Met said: ""The European Arrest Warrant was issued as part of the Met's efforts to trace Mr Acourt in relation to an investigation into the unlawful supply of controlled substances. ""This relates to an investigation launched in 2016 by detectives from the Serious and Organised Crime Command. ""Extradition proceedings now await."" Steve Reynolds, the NCA's regional head of international operations, toldRadio 4's Today Programmethat many fugitives ""believe they can hide in plain sight"" among Spain's large British community. Mr Reynolds said Mr Acourt's extradition is likely to take ""days or weeks rather than months"". Mr Acourt will appear at court in Madrid early next week for an extradition hearing. Spanish police confirmed Mr Accourt had been refused bail by a high court judge and transferred to a prison ahead of the hearing.

Proctor sues over false child abuse claimsThe former MP says the accusations led to him losing his job and home and suffering from depression.12h12 hours agoUK,"Harvey Proctor was a Conservative MP between 1979 and 1987 A former MP is claiming Â£1m in damages from the Metropolitan Police after being falsely accused of child sexual abuse and murder. Harvey Proctor is also taking legal action against his accuser - a man known by the pseudonym ""Nick"". Mr Proctor says the allegations and subsequent investigation by the Met resulted in him losing his job and home, and suffering from depression. Scotland Yard said it would be defending the claim. The investigation, known as Operation Midland, began in 2014 when Nick named Mr Proctor as one of a number of men who he claimed were part of an establishment paedophile ring in the 1970s and 1980s. The former MP was cleared in 2016 when the Met said it had found insufficient evidence to consider any criminal charges.  Scotland Yard apologised and a review of the case strongly criticised the investigation. Mr Proctor's claim - filed at the High Court and seen by the BBC - identifies the Met Police Commissioner and Nick as the two defendants. Mr Proctor's legal claim says that Nick's allegations were ""false and malicious"" and designed to damage him in an attempt to pervert the course of justice. He claims police could have carried out ""elementary research"" to dismiss them before taking any action that would have resulted in him being affected. He is accusing the Met of conspiring with Nick and a news agency, Exaro, which first published the allegations and facilitated a meeting with detectives. Mr Proctor's claim highlights the statement by a senior police officer in late 2014 that Nick's claims were ""credible and true"". He also says a police application for a warrant to search his home in Leicestershire amounted to an attempt to pervert the course of justice because it relied on Nick's allegations. His legal claim details how police raised ""child protection concerns"" about him during the investigation and asked his employer - Belvoir Castle in Leicestershire - to suspend him. He ended being forced to resign and lost his home, which was part of his employment at the castle. Mr Proctor is also claiming his privacy was breached. Since the investigation he has suffered what his doctor describes in the claim as a ""major depressive episode"". Operation Midland began in 2014 after Nick claimed boys had been sexually abused and that three had been murdered by a group of powerful men from politics, the military and law enforcement agencies. Retired judge Sir Richard Henriques later reviewed the investigation and identified 43 serious failings in his report, including that Nick had been believed for too long and that search warrants had been applied for with flawed information. Northumbria Police has carried out an criminal investigation into Nick's actions and the CPS is currently considering the evidence. Nick is separately facing a trial in connection with six charges of possessing images of child abuse and voyeurism. The Metropolitan Police has already paid damages to Lord Bramall, the former chief of the defence staff, and the family of Lord Brittan, both of whom were also accused by Nick and investigated.

TSB fiasco: 'Our 24 hours of moving chaos',"Chris and Sally Jones spent 24 hours fearing they could be left stranded TSB's reputation will depend on how it compensates customers for the distress and inconvenience caused by its IT fiasco, an expert has said. Richard Lloyd, chairman of complaints service Resolver, said the bank would be ""in big trouble"" if it failed with customers' less tangible losses. A perfect illustration is the case of the Jones family - TSB mortgage-holders - who were expecting to move house. For 24 hours they faced the prospect of having to move to a hotel instead. The migration of data on TSB's five million customers from former owner Lloyds' IT system to a new one managed by Sabadell has led to nearly two weeks of difficulties for the bank and more than 40,000 customer complaints so far. TSB boss Paul Pester to give up Â£2m bonus amid IT mess How it all went so wrong for TSB Mother-of-two Sally Jones, 40, said their saga began with a concerned call from their solicitor on Wednesday afternoon - the day before the family were expecting to move to their new home in south London. The solicitor explained that, for no apparent reason, a new account number could not be uploaded on to TSB's new IT system, so funds might not be released for their house purchase. At exactly the same time, TSB chief executive Paul Pester was telling MPs that the ""underlying engine"" of the bank was working well. A sleepless night followed, before the removals van arrived early on Thursday, and their belongings were loaded up. Their daughters - Hannah, six, and Sophie, three - were despatched to school and nursery. Then, their moving day stress became even more acute. ""The TSB staff were being as helpful as possible, but they were hampered by the terrible IT mess. It was a ridiculous situation to be in. We were in limbo,"" she said. As the day went on they started to call hotels. Decorators were expecting to arrive the next day, and the removals company said the next available slot for delivering their belongings was after the bank holiday. First they sat outside their new home waiting for the money to come through. Then, powerless to do anything, the couple's wait continued in the pub. Eventually, with the clock ticking the call came through that the TSB computer had at last said ""yes"". They could finally pick up the keys and move into their new home. Mrs Jones said they would complain, but the extra stress will be difficult to quantify in terms of compensation. TSB has said that no customers will be left out of pocket, and it has called in accountancy firm Deloitte to devise a system of redress for customers. ""I do not think that is going to make consumers feel particularly confident that they are going to be treated fairly,"" said Mr Lloyd, of Resolver. He said that there were no clear industry rules on what kind of compensation should be agreed for stress and inconvenience. ""How TSB deals with this will be as important to their reputation in the future as the meltdown itself,"" he told Radio 4's Today programme. ""If they do not deal with this less tangible loss properly and fairly then they will be in big trouble."" He suggested that anyone affected should document what had happened, and consider taking a case to the financial ombudsman if they were unhappy with how TSB dealt with their complaint. TSB apologised and promised the couple would not be left out of pocket. A spokesperson said: ""We're really sorry for the experience Mr and Mrs Jones have had whilst moving home and the inconvenience this has caused them. ""This isn't the level of service that we pride ourselves on providing, and isn't what our customers have come to expect from TSB. We have reached out to Mr and Mrs Jones, and we will ensure that they are not left out of pocket.""

Relations between Russia and the West have deteriorated in recent months amid allegations of Russian meddling in US elections, Moscow's support for President Bashar al-Assad of Syria and the poisoning of former spy Sergei Skripal, for which the UK blames Russia.

Honduras migrants to lose protected US status,"Tens of thousands of Hondurans in the US could be affected The Trump administration has announced the end of temporary protections for thousands of Honduran immigrants. Up to 57,000 people could be forced to leave the US by 5 January 2020, when their temporary protected status (TPS) will be revoked. Hondurans were granted this status after Hurricane Mitch hit the Central American country in 1998. The Department of Homeland Security said conditions in the country had ""notably improved"" since the disaster. The 2020 deadline gives time for people with TPS ""to arrange for their departure or to seek an alternative lawful immigration,""the statement reads,external. What is temporary protected status? The people protesting Trump's immigration deadline Honduras's government said it ""profoundly regrets"" the end of the programme. The country's ambassador to the US, Marlon Tabora, said the country could not handle repatriating tens of thousands of people, Reuters news agency reports. The Trump administration has announced plans to end TPS for several nationalities ""These families have lived in the United States for 20 years and re-integrating them into the country will not be easy if they decide to return,"" he said. The Trump administration previously announced plans to cancel TPS for immigrants from Haiti and El Salvador, which they had been given after natural disasters in those countries. US to end Haitian immigrant scheme Trump gives Salvadoreans deadline to leave Critics believe the US government is ignoring continuing dangers in home countries in its decisions to cancel TPS. But some argue the repeated extension of the programme has resulted in de facto residency rights for those who benefit. A legal group in Boston, the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights and Economic Justice, said they would amend a legal complaint about the recent cancellation of TPS status to include the Hondurans.

"Massive quake follows Hawaii eruptionsSeveral quakes including a magnitude 6.9 hit the US state, a day after the Kilauea volcano erupted.11m12 minutes agoUS & Canada","This video can not be played Lava flows are continuing from the Kilauea volcano in Hawaii A number of strong earthquakes have hit Hawaii's Big Island, a day after the eruption of the Kilauea volcano. One 6.9 magnitude quake, south-east of the volcano, was the most powerful to hit the US state since 1975. It briefly cut power and sent people fleeing from buildings but there was no tsunami warning. Meanwhile, several fresh eruptions spewed fountains of lava 30m (100ft), destroying several homes and leaving fissures on three streets. The Civil Defense Agency told any remaining residents to evacuate. It said there were deadly levels of dangerous sulphur dioxide gas in the air and emergency crews would not be able to help anyone affected. The new volcanic activity in Mt Kilauea's lower east rift zone amounted to ""vigorous lava spattering"", the US Geological Survey (USGS) said, adding that additional outbreaks in the area were likely. The USGS said ""vigorous lava spattering"" was happening The lava was not travelling more than a ""few tens of yards"" from the vents, which were on streets in the Leilani Estates neighbourhood near Big Island's eastern tip, the USGS said. However, ground deformation was continuing and there was high earthquake activity in the area, it said. Meanwhile, the level of the lava lake inside the volcano was continuing to drop. Two homes were destroyed in the latest activity, ABC quoted Hawaii island Mayor Harry Kim as saying. Maija Stenback, an eyewitness, told the BBC the eruption ""was like when someone plays the bass really heavy: you could really feel the power and the lava"". ""The colour was unbelievable, and the sound was unbelievable,"" she said. ""You could hear and feel the eruption a good half a mile away, and the closer you got, the more you could feel it."" Residents described fleeing their homes on Thursday evening. ""My family is safe, the rest of the stuff can be replaced. When I bought here 14 years [ago], I knew that this day would eventually come. Butthe reality is sinking in now,external,"" one resident told Hawaii News Now. A spokesperson for Hawaii's Mayor, Janet Snyder, said ""elevated levels"" of sulphur dioxide were stopping people returning to evacuated areas. ""It is quite toxic and in fact, even our first responders find it too hazardous at this time to go back into the sub-divisions without heavy, protective equipment,"" she said. Steaming cracks appeared moments before a fissure opened early on Friday morning Thursday's eruption prompted a local state of emergency and the mandatory evacuation of 1,700 residents. Community centres have been opened to provide shelter for evacuees. Kilauea is one of the world's most active volcanoes and the eruption follows a series of recent earthquakes. Officials had been warning residents all week they should be prepared to evacuate as an eruption would give little warning. A volcanic crater vent - known as Puu Oo - collapsed earlier this week, sending lava down the mountain's slopes towards populated areas. Dr Dougal Jerram, an earth scientist at the University of Oslo, told the BBC that the quake had ""occurred in the middle of a housing estate effectively, erupting through the roads, with magma shooting 30 metres up into the sky"". Hawaii's Governor, David Ige, said he had activated military reservists from the National Guard to help evacuate thousands of people. Allow Twitter content?

College loses weapons-grade plutonium,"A US university faces a fine of $8,500 (Â£6,280) for apparently losing a small amount of weapons-grade plutonium. The US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) said Idaho State University is unable to account for 1 gram (0.03oz) of the material. The plutonium is used in reactors and to make nuclear bombs but the NRC says the amount missing is too small to make a nuclear weapon. The university says documents show the material was on campus from 2003-04. However, anNRC report says that in October 2017 three teams at the university conducted a physical search,externalfor the material and failed to find it. ""The NRC considers the loss of control of licensed radioactive material a significant regulatory concern because of the potential for unauthorised possession or use of licensed radioactive material or the unnecessary exposure of members of the public to radiation,"" a statement said. Experts say that although the amount of plutonium is not sufficient to build a weapon, it could be used in a ""dirty bomb"" to spread radiation. The university has not yet responded to the latest NRC statement.
