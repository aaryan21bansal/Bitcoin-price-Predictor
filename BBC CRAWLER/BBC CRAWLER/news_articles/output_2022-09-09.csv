Born: 2023 Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank's second son was born on 30 May 2023. It is the first royal birth since the coronation of King Charles, Eugenie's uncle. Ernest is13th in line to the throne, moving the Duke of Edinburgh down to 14th place. Born: 1964 Prince Edward was given the title Duke of Edinburgh on his 59th birthday, almost two years after the death of his father Prince Philip, who previously held the title. It was understood that Philip had wanted Edward to take on the title, but the decision was left to King Charles. Prince Edward's wife Sophie becomes the Duchess of Edinburgh and the prince's former title, the Earl of Wessex, has now been given to his son James, Viscount Severn. The couple also have a daughter, Lady Louise, born in 2003. After a brief period with the Royal Marines, the prince formed his own TV production company.

When James was born, he was given the title Viscount Severn - a ""courtesy"" title as son of an earl, rather than using prince. It is thought his parents made this decision to avoid some of the burdens of royal titles. Born: 2003 Born in 2003, Lady Louise Windsor is the elder child of the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh. However, she is lower in the line of succession than her younger brother because she was born before a law came into force scrapping the system that meant a younger son could displace an older daughter.

She was given the title Princess Royal in June 1987.

The princess was the first royal to use the surname Mountbatten-Windsor in an official document, in the marriage register after her wedding to Capt Phillips. She competed in equestrian events for Great Britain in the 1976 Montreal Olympics and is involved with a number of charities, including Save the Children, of which she has been president since 1970. Born: 1977 Peter Phillips is the eldest of the late queen's grandchildren. He married Canadian Autumn Kelly in 2008 and together they have two daughters, Savannah, born in 2010, and Isla, born in 2012. The children of the Princess Royal do not have royal titles, as they are descended from the female line. Mark Phillips refused the offer of an earldom when he married so their children do not have courtesy titles. Peter Phillips and his wife announced they were getting divorced in February 2020. Born: 2010 Savannah, born in 2010, is the elder daughter of Peter Phillips and Autumn Kelly and was the late queen's first great-grandchild. Born: 2012 Isla, born in 2012, is the second daughter of Peter Phillips and Autumn Kelly.

Queen's children remember 'that fantastic twinkle',"This video can not be played Watch: Three of Queen Elizabeth II's children pay tribute after her death Queen Elizabeth's children have shared their favourite memories of their mother's sense of humour, love of family holidays and ""fantastic twinkle"". The royals were speaking as part of a BBC One Special - A Tribute to Her Majesty The Queen. King Charles recalled a moment before Queen Elizabeth's coronation in 1953. ""I shall never forget, when we were small, having a bath and she came in practicing wearing the crown before the coronation,"" he said. ""All those sorts of marvellous moments, I shall never forget."" Charles was just three years old when his mother ascended to the throne. Now 73, he has had more training in the lead up to becoming King than any other British monarch. But he will miss having his mother to talk to: ""She was always there, I could talk to her about this, that, or the other. I think that's always going to be something that will be very difficult not to have."" The Queen and her daughter Princess Anne, shown here in Sandringham, England in 1979, shared a love of horses During a life of public service, moments of privacy were treasured, and they were often found in family holidays, the Queen's only daughter, Princess Anne, said. ""There was a lot going on in those periods... it was probably the times she most enjoyed,"" the 72-year-old Princess Royal told the BBC. ""Partly because it included all the things she enjoyed - the countryside, the dogs, the horses, and just being out and about - and being able to get away a bit from that public gaze."" The Queen's youngest son reminisced about ""probably the most jaw-dropping moment in any film television production"": her entrance to the 2012 London Olympic Games opening ceremony. A short film shows the Queen at Buckingham Palace meeting Daniel Craig, who played the famed secret agent James Bond in five films. With corgies in tow, the monarch boards a helicopter and then skydives into the Olympic stadium - with some help from a stunt double. ""There was Daniel Craig as James Bond, arriving at Buckingham Palaceâ¦ and everybody, wherever you were in the world, was thinking exactly the same thought - who will be playing the Queen? And it was the Queen,"" Prince Edward, 58, said. ""And it had the same effect on everybody who was watching - they just couldn't believe it. ""I thought it was an extraordinary moment because it just showed that fantastic twinkle and sense of humour - the fact that my mother kept that completely to herself, and the team didn't tell anybody was just brilliant.""

MPs share funny and moving memories of Queen,"This video can not be played Watch: Tears and laughter as MPs and peers pay tribute to Queen Elizabeth II Politicians from both Houses of Parliament have gathered to mark the death of Queen Elizabeth II and share their memories of the late monarch. Prime Minister Liz Truss described the Queen as one of the world's greatest-ever leaders, as she opened two days of special tributes in Parliament. MPs and ex-PMs paid their respects in personal speeches that aroused both tears and laughter in emotional scenes. A minute's silence was held to remember the Queen after 70 years on the throne. Both Houses of Parliament are sitting on Friday and Saturday to allow politicians to pay tribute to the Queen, following her death on Thursday. Follow the latest developments A life well lived - King pays tribute to his mother Former prime ministers reflect on Queen's reign Obituary: A long life marked by a sense of duty Friday's proceedings in Parliament paused at 18:00 BST for MPs and peers to watch the new king, Charles III, deliver a televised address to the nation, his first as monarch. Earlier, King Charles III was greeted by crowds singing ""God save the king"" outside Buckingham Palace, where he held his first in-person audience with Ms Truss. On Saturday, Ms Truss and senior ministers will attend the Accession Council at St James's Palace, where Charles will be formally proclaimed king. In Parliament on Friday, MPs and peers from all sides, dressed in dark clothing, paid tribute to the Queen by sharing memories of their own encounters with her. There have been many anecdotes about the Queen's wisdom, sense of humour and ability to put people at their ease. Some MPs laughed uproariously as former Prime Minister Theresa May recalled how mortified she was when the Queen caught her returning a dropped piece of cheese to a plate, as she helped prepare a picnic at Balmoral. ""I looked at her. She looked at me. And she just smiled. And the cheese remained on the table."" But the session began in solemn fashion, as Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle invited a packed Commons chamber to rise and observe a minute's silence. MPs stood for a minute's silence as they gathered for tributes to the Queen As the silence ended, Sir Lindsay described the Queen as a ""devoted monarch"" who had seen 57 complete sessions of Parliament during her reign in a brief speech. Ms Truss, who was appointed prime minister by the Queen just three days ago at Balmoral, paid tribute to her ""sheer humanity"", which she said had made her ""loved and admired"" all over the world. She said her reign had been ""dignified but not distant"" and credited her with re-inventing the British monarchy for the modern age. The Queen's successor, her eldest son King Charles III, now carried the ""awesome responsibility"" of the British crown, added the prime minister. ""The crown endures. Our nation endures. And in that spirit, I say God save the King."" Cheers of approval erupted from MPs, with some shouting ""God save the King"" from the side gallery in the moments after Ms Truss's speech concluded. This video can not be played Liz Truss: Queen 'one of the greatest leaders the world has known' Next to speak was the leader of the Opposition, Labour MP Sir Keir Starmer, who reflected on the tumultuous political events of recent times and the extraordinary national change heralded by the Queen's death. ""When everything is spinning, a nation requires a still point, when times are difficult, it requires comfort, and when direction is hard to find, it requires leadership,"" Sir Keir said. ""The loss of our Queen robs this country of its stillest point, its greatest comfort, at precisely the time we need those things most."" He said the Queen had enjoyed a ""personal relationship with us all"", based on ""total commitment"" to duty and a ""deep devotion to the country, the Commonwealth, and the people she loved"". This video can not be played Watch: Sir Keir Starmer pays tribute to the Queen Boris Johnson - who offered the Queen his resignation as prime minister at Balmoral on Tuesday - reflected on that meeting, saying the late monarch ""was as radiant and as knowledgeable and as fascinated by politics as ever I can remember"". Praising the late monarch as ""Elizabeth the Great"", he recalled her ""humility"" and, like other former leaders, spoke of informal gatherings with the Royal Family, at Balmoral. ""Unlike us politicians, with our outriders and our armour-plated convoys, I can tell you as a direct eyewitness that she drove herself in her own car with no detectives and no bodyguard, bouncing at alarming speed over the Scottish landscape to the total amazement of the ramblers and the tourists we encountered."" Mrs May described her weekly prime ministerial meetings with the Queen as ""a conversation with a woman of experience and knowledge and immense wisdom"". ""They were also the one meeting I went to, which I knew it would not be briefed out to the media,"" Mrs May said, to laughter from MPs. Harriet Harman, who is known as Mother of the House, told MPs about the Queen's kindness after she lost her senior government role in 1998. ""My diary was empty, and my phone stopped ringing. My office was astonished to get a call from Buckingham Palace. No one else wanted to have anything to do with me, but the Queen wanted to see me. ""I was invited to take tea with the Queen for her to thank me for my service as secretary of state."" This video can not be played Theresa May shares an amusing story about how down-to-earth the Queen was SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford used his speech to draw attention to the Queen's well-known affection for Scotland, where she spent her final days at Balmoral Castle. ""The relationship between Scotland and the Queen was one of shared admiration,"" Mr Blackford said. ""Indeed, whilst she was everyone's Queen, for many in Scotland, she was Elizabeth, Queen of Scots."" Former Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett said she was one of the few MPs to remember the Queen's coronation in 1953. The veteran Labour MP shared fond memories of the Queen's sense of fun, and choked back tears as she hailed ""a remarkable person, a remarkable monarch"". Meanwhile in the Lords, the newly appointed leader of Parliament's upper house, Lord True, led tributes to the Queen, calling her an ""anchor of stability in a changing world"". Ending his moving tribute, Lord True looked poignantly at the sovereign's throne, where the Queen had sat for numerous state openings of Parliament, and said: ""Thank you, Ma'am. May you ever rest in peace as you will ever rest in our hearts."" His words were followed by those of Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, who spoke of the Queen's ""profound sense of being called by God"" and her dry sense of humour. And former Labour cabinet minister Lord Blunkett recalled how the Queen came to his aid after he ended up facing the wrong way as he knelt during a royal audience. The blind peer said the Queen, in a ""careful and never patronising way"" managed to ""gently - by touching my arm - shift me round"". On Saturday evening, Parliament will be postponed until after 21 September, during a period of national mourning.

It is thought his parents made this decision to avoid some of the burdens of royal titles. Born: 2003 Born in 2003, Lady Louise Windsor is the elder child of the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh. However, she is lower in the line of succession than her younger brother because she was born before a law came into force scrapping the system that meant a younger son could displace an older daughter. Born: 1950 Anne, Princess Royal is Elizabeth II and Prince Philip's second child and only daughter. When she was born she was third in line to the throne, but is now17th. She was given the title Princess Royal in June 1987. Princess Anne has married twice; her first husband Captain Mark Phillips is the father of her two children, Peter and Zara, while her second is Vice-Admiral Sir Timothy Laurence. The princess was the first royal to use the surname Mountbatten-Windsor in an official document, in the marriage register after her wedding to Capt Phillips. She competed in equestrian events for Great Britain in the 1976 Montreal Olympics and is involved with a number of charities, including Save the Children, of which she has been president since 1970. Born: 1977 Peter Phillips is the eldest of the late queen's grandchildren. He married Canadian Autumn Kelly in 2008 and together they have two daughters, Savannah, born in 2010, and Isla, born in 2012. The children of the Princess Royal do not have royal titles, as they are descended from the female line. Mark Phillips refused the offer of an earldom when he married so their children do not have courtesy titles. Peter Phillips and his wife announced they were getting divorced in February 2020. Born: 2010 Savannah, born in 2010, is the elder daughter of Peter Phillips and Autumn Kelly and was the late queen's first great-grandchild. Born: 2012 Isla, born in 2012, is the second daughter of Peter Phillips and Autumn Kelly. Born: 1981 Zara Tindall followed her mother and father with a highly successful riding career - including winning a silver medal at the London 2012 Olympics. She married former England rugby player Mike Tindall in 2011 and the couple had their first child, Mia Grace, in 2014. The children of the Princess Royal do not hold a royal title, as they are descended from the female line, but she remains21st in line to the throne.Their father, Mark Phillips, turned down an earldom when he married Princess Anne, so they do not have courtesy titles. Born: 2014 Zara Tindall gave birth to her first child, Mia Grace, in January 2014. Born: 2018 The couple's second child was born on 18 June 2018 at Stroud Maternity Unit, Gloucestershire, weighing 9lb 3oz. Lena Elizabeth was named in honour of her great-grandmother. Like her sister, Lena does not have a royal title and so will also be known as Miss Tindall.

King Charles III's address in full,"This video can not be played Watch: King Charles's first speech in full King Charles III gave the following address to the nation and Commonwealth. I speak to you today with feelings of profound sorrow. Throughout her life, Her Majesty the Queen - my beloved Mother - was an inspiration and example to me and to all my family, and we owe her the most heartfelt debt any family can owe to their mother; for her love, affection, guidance, understanding and example. Queen Elizabeth's was a life well lived; a promise with destiny kept and she is mourned most deeply in her passing. That promise of lifelong service I renew to you all today. Alongside the personal grief that all my family are feeling, we also share with so many of you in the United Kingdom, in all the countries where the Queen was head of state, in the Commonwealth and across the world, a deep sense of gratitude for the more than 70 years in which my mother, as Queen, served the people of so many nations. In 1947, on her 21st birthday, she pledged in a broadcast from Cape Town to the Commonwealth to devote her life, whether it be short or long, to the service of her peoples. That was more than a promise: it was a profound personal commitment which defined her whole life. She made sacrifices for duty. Her dedication and devotion as sovereign never wavered, through times of change and progress, through times of joy and celebration, and through times of sadness and loss. In her life of service we saw that abiding love of tradition, together with that fearless embrace of progress, which make us great as nations. The affection, admiration and respect she inspired became the hallmark of her reign. And, as every member of my family can testify, she combined these qualities with warmth, humour and an unerring ability always to see the best in people. I pay tribute to my mother's memory and I honour her life of service. I know that her death brings great sadness to so many of you and I share that sense of loss, beyond measure, with you all. When the Queen came to the throne, Britain and the world were still coping with the privations and aftermath of the Second World War, and still living by the conventions of earlier times. In the course of the last 70 years we have seen our society become one of many cultures and many faiths. The institutions of the state have changed in turn. But, through all changes and challenges, our nation and the wider family of realms - of whose talents, traditions and achievements I am so inexpressibly proud - have prospered and flourished. Our values have remained, and must remain, constant. The role and the duties of monarchy also remain, as does the sovereign's particular relationship and responsibility towards the Church of England - the Church in which my own faith is so deeply rooted. In that faith, and the values it inspires, I have been brought up to cherish a sense of duty to others, and to hold in the greatest respect the precious traditions, freedoms and responsibilities of our unique history and our system of parliamentary government. As the Queen herself did with such unswerving devotion, I too now solemnly pledge myself, throughout the remaining time God grants me, to uphold the constitutional principles at the heart of our nation. And wherever you may live in the United Kingdom, or in the realms and territories across the world, and whatever may be your background or beliefs, I shall endeavour to serve you with loyalty, respect and love, as I have throughout my life. My life will of course change as I take up my new responsibilities. It will no longer be possible for me to give so much of my time and energies to the charities and issues for which I care so deeply. But I know this important work will go on in the trusted hands of others. This is also a time of change for my family. I count on the loving help of my darling wife, Camilla. In recognition of her own loyal public service since our marriage seventeen years ago, she becomes my Queen Consort. I know she will bring to the demands of her new role the steadfast devotion to duty on which I have come to rely so much. As my heir, William now assumes the Scottish titles which have meant so much to me. He succeeds me as Duke of Cornwall and takes on the responsibilities for the Duchy of Cornwall which I have undertaken for more than five decades. Today, I am proud to create him Prince of Wales, Tywysog Cymru, the country whose title I have been so greatly privileged to bear during so much of my life and duty. With Catherine beside him, our new Prince and Princess of Wales will, I know, continue to inspire and lead our national conversations, helping to bring the marginal to the centre ground where vital help can be given. I want also to express my love for Harry and Meghan as they continue to build their lives overseas. In a little over a week's time we will come together as a nation, as a Commonwealth and indeed a global community, to lay my beloved mother to rest. In our sorrow, let us remember and draw strength from the light of her example. On behalf of all my family, I can only offer the most sincere and heartfelt thanks for your condolences and support. They mean more to me than I can ever possibly express. And to my darling Mama, as you begin your last great journey to join my dear late Papa, I want simply to say this: thank you. Thank you for your love and devotion to our family and to the family of nations you have served so diligently all these years. May ""flights of Angels sing thee to thy rest"".

The Queen's life in pictures,"Queen Elizabeth II lived her life in the spotlight. We look back at her reign, from baby to heir to Britain's longest-reigning monarch. Elizabeth Alexandra Mary Windsor was born on 21 April 1926, in a house off Berkeley Square in London. She was the first child of Albert, Duke of York - the second son of George V - and his wife, the former Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon In her early years, the throne was not her destiny However, she was said to have shown a sense of responsibility from a very young age Both Elizabeth and her sister, Margaret Rose, who was born in 1930, were educated at home Following the abdication of King Edward VIII in 1936, Elizabeth's father became King George VI and she became heir During World War Two, Elizabeth and her sister Margaret were evacuated to Windsor. This picture shows them broadcasting to the nation for Children's Hour on the BBC The young princess briefly joined the Auxiliary Territorial Service (ATS) towards the end of the war, learning to drive and service a lorry In 1947 she married a distant cousin, Philip Mountbatten, who became Duke of Edinburgh Their first child, Charles (pictured), was born in 1948, followed by a sister, Anne, who arrived in 1950 Elizabeth remained very close to her mother throughout her life. They are pictured here in 1951 attending a wedding In January 1952, Elizabeth and Philip set off on an overseas tour in place of her father, who had been ill. The King died in his sleep just days later Elizabeth returned home immediately. The new Queen was just 25 years old First came the King's funeral. Here Queen Mary, his mother, watches as the body of George VI is brought to Westminster Hall, London, for the lying-in-state. Queen Elizabeth stands behind her grandmother, and the Queen Mother is on the right Then, in June 1953, Elizabeth was crowned at Westminster Abbey Following the coronation, Queen Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edinburgh made an appearance on the Buckingham Palace balcony and waved to the cheering crowds Although Britain was still enduring post-war austerity, some commentators described the coronation as the dawn of a new Elizabethan age. Here, Queen Elizabeth II ascends the Grand Staircase at the Opera in Paris, France In 1957, the Queen made the first of many televised Christmas Day broadcasts to the nation British society and attitudes to the monarchy were changing and the term ""the Monarchy"" was gradually replaced by ""the Royal Family"". The Queen is the object of the neighbours' gaze while visiting the home of Mr and Mrs Eddie Hammond at Crawley New Town, Sussex in 1958 Between official engagements Elizabeth spent time with her family - here with her daughter Princess Anne at Frogmore, Windsor Castle In 1966, at Wembley, the Queen presented the Jules Rimet Trophy to England captain Bobby Moore after he led his team to a 4-2 World Cup final victory over West Germany On 29 October 1966, the Queen visited the Welsh village of Aberfan, eight days after a coal tip landslide engulfed Pantglas Junior School killing 144 people, 116 of them children. The Queen was visibly moved and it remains one of the most emotive moments of her reign In 1969, the documentary Royal Family was first broadcast. It gave audiences an unprecedented view of a year in the private and public life of the Queen and her family The Queen formally invested her son Prince Charles with the Coronet of the Prince of Wales during a ceremony at Caernarfon Castle. He took on the title when he was nine, but the Queen insisted the ceremony should wait until he fully understood its significance In 1972 the Queen was pictured on board HMY Britannia as part of series of photographs taken for use during her Silver Wedding Celebrations. Throughout her reign the Queen has been pictured with corgis at her side. The Royal Family's ties with the breed began when the future George VI bought a corgi called Dookie for his daughters in 1933 In 1977 the country celebrated the Queen's Silver Jubilee, marking 25 years on the throne. The Queen was met by enthusiastic crowds as she toured the country Her Majesty visited 36 counties over 10 weeks - including Avon, where she observed people making the most of the summer weather. She also travelled 56,000 miles around the world in celebration The Queen and the duke were on hand to wave as Concorde flew low past by the Royal Yacht Britannia as the royal couple neared Barbados Year by year, the Queen's public duties continued. Her Majesty and the Duke of Edinburgh received a New Zealand Maori welcome at the opening of the Royal New Zealand Polynesian Festival In August 1979, Prince Philip's uncle and a cousin of the Queen, Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma, was killed by an IRA bomb while on his boat in Ireland. As well as being a close family member, Lord Mountbatten had held many senior military positions, and his funeral was held in Westminster Abbey In 1981, Elizabeth's eldest son Charles married Lady Diana Spencer. Charles and Diana had two sons, William and Harry, before divorcing. Diana died in a car accident in Paris in 1997 During her Christmas speech the Queen described 1992 as her ""annus horribilis"", expressing sorrow at a year which saw the break-up of three of her children's marriages and a fire at Windsor Castle Public opinion was against the government paying for repairs to the castle. The monarchy was on the defensive, and Buckingham Palace was opened to visitors in order to raise the funds. The Queen fired the last shot on a standard SA80 rifle with the Army Rifle Association at Bisley After the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, in 1997, the Queen faced criticism for not appearing in public. Eventually she viewed tributes outside Buckingham Palace and made a live broadcast to the nation The Queen joined Mrs Susan McCarron for tea in her home in the Castlemilk area of Glasgow, as the Royal Family experimented with a more intimate, informal approach to meeting the public In 2000, the Queen Mother celebrated her 100th birthday - here with her daughters Princess Margaret and Queen Elizabeth In 2002, the Queen faced the deaths of her sister, Princess Margaret, and her mother, the Queen Mother, pictured here, just seven weeks apart The Queen enjoyed a swell of support that summer as she celebrated her Golden Jubilee. Huge numbers turned out for a parade and a million people crowded into The Mall on the evening of the Jubilee on 4 June In 2005, Queen Elizabeth watched her eldest son get married for a second time. Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles wed in a civil ceremony at Windsor Guildhall, followed by a blessing at St George's Chapel in Windsor Castle Elizabeth, Duke of Edinburgh, the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall share a moment at the Braemar Highland Games in Aberdeenshire In 2007 the Queen was pictured sheltering from the rain during the opening of the Lawn Tennis Association's new headquarters in Roehampton The Queen quoted Groucho Marx's dictum on ageing in a speech to celebrate her official 80th birthday saying: ""Anyone can get old; all you have to do is to live long enough"" One of the happiest events in her later years was the wedding of her grandson Prince William to Catherine Middleton in 2011. Here Prince William and his new bride bow to the Queen The Queen nearly lost her hat on arrival at a windy RAF Valley in Anglesey where she and Prince Philip were visiting Prince William, who was posted to the base at the time A visit to Leicester marked the start of her 60th anniversary Diamond Jubilee tour of the UK in 2012 This was closely followed by an appearance in the opening ceremony of the London Olympics, in a filmed sequence alongside another British icon, James Bond, played by actor Daniel Craig Sixty years after enjoying a first Royal Ascot winner as an owner, the Queen's horse Estimate won the 207th Gold Cup, bringing great joy to both herself and her racing manager John Warren At 17:30 BST on 9 September 2015, Elizabeth had reigned for 23,226 days, 16 hours and approximately 30 minutes - surpassing the reign of her great-great-grandmother Queen Victoria. She spent the day in Scotland opening a new railway The Queen was joined by other members of the Royal Family for her official birthday celebrations in June 2016. She had turned 90 earlier that year The Queen continued with her public duties, often alone after the retirement of the Duke of Edinburgh.

"Camilla, the new Queen Consort","She is the love of Charles's life, his confidante since they were young and his wife of 17 years. And now, she is his Queen Consort. The public has got used to seeing Camilla by her husband's side at key national and international events and celebrations, but as she has admitted, it has been far from easy. Few women have been as publicly vilified as Camilla Parker Bowles. She was ""the other woman""  in the marriage break-up of the century, endlessly compared to Diana, Princess of Wales. In choosing Charles, she upended her life. For years she was hounded by the press, her character and appearance relentlessly attacked. But she weathered the storm and gradually cemented her position as the most senior female member of the Royal Family. Camilla Parker Bowles (L), age 4, with her brother Mark Shand and sister Annabel Camilla (L) aged 16 with Virginia Crookshank and Rosemary Boord at Lords Cricket Ground in 1963 It has been quite a journey for the woman who, it is said, Prince Charles immediately fell for when they met in their early 20s. Full acceptance from Queen Elizabeth II took time, but in her final years she was unequivocal in her support for Camilla. The new Queen may never achieve full acceptance from the public, but as she said herself, in an interview with Vogue magazine earlier this year: ""I sort of rise above it and get on with it. You've got to get on with life."" Marrying the heir to the throne would not have been the future predicted for Camilla Rosemary Shand, who was born on 17 July 1947. Her family were upper-class, wealthy and well-connected, but definitely not royal.â¯ She grew up in a close-knit, loving environment, playing with her brother and sister on a picturesque family estate in Sussex. Her father, Bruce Shand, a retired Army officer, liked to read her bedtime stories, and her mother, Rosalind, ferried the children to school, activities, and the beach. It was a very different childhood to that of Charles, who had long periods of time without his parents as they travelled the world. A finishing school in Switzerland prepared Camilla for life as a debutante in London society. She was popular, and from the mid-60s she was in an on-off relationship with a Household Cavalry officer called Andrew Parker Bowles. After years of an on-and-off relationship, Camilla married Andrew Parker Bowles in 1973 In the early 1970s she was introduced to the young Prince Charles. According to Jonathan Dimbleby, who wrote a biography of the prince, ""she was affectionate, she was unassuming, and - with all the intensity of first love - he lost his heart to her almost at once"". But the timing was not right. Charles was still in his early 20s and pursuing a career in the Navy. He set off on an eight-month deployment overseas in late 1972. And while he was away, Andrew proposed to Camilla, and she accepted. Why not wait for Charles to ask? Friends have speculated she simply never saw herself as Queen material. However spurned Charles might have felt, they continued to be a part of each other's lives. They moved in the same social circles, Charles and Andrew played polo together, and the couple asked Charles to be godfather to their first child, Tom. Photographs of Charles and Camilla at polo meets show a relaxed intimacy. Charles, left, and Camilla were first pictured together in 1972 They would go on to be repeatedly photographed together on the edge of polo matches By the summer of 1981, Charles had met and proposed to the young Lady Diana Spencer. Still Camilla was a part of his life. In Diana: Her True Story, author Andrew Morton detailed how Diana almost called off the wedding two days before it was due to take place after finding a bracelet Charles had had made for Camilla engraved with the letters ""F"" and ""G"" - their pet names for each other were Fred and Gladys. King Charles III, the new monarch That Diana struggled with Camilla's relationship with her husband is without question. Charles insisted that they only rekindled their romance when his marriage had ""irretrievably broken down"". But as Diana so memorably stated in the now-discredited 1995 Panorama interview ""there were three of us in this marriage"". As both Charles and Camilla's marriages deteriorated, some of the headlines were excruciating, perhaps none more so than the details of a late night phone call secretly recorded in 1989 and made public four years later. Charles's expressed wish to be Camilla's tampon made clear the level of intimacy between them. Camilla, left, and Lady Diana Spencer at Ludlow racecourse in 1980, watching Charles compete Camilla's divorce was finalised in 1995. Charles and Diana's marriage officially ended in 1996. It is a mark of the strength of feeling Camilla had for Charles that she chose to be with him, despite the public hostility and disruption it caused to her own family, especially her two children Tom and Laura.â¯ Tom Parker Bowles has spoken about the days when the paparazzi used to hide in bushes outside the family home in Wiltshire. ""There is nothing anyone could say about our family that would offend us any more,"" he wrote in The Times newspaper in 2017, adding: ""My mother is bullet-proof."" Of those days, Camilla said: ""Nobody likes to be looked at all the time. You just have to find a way to live with it."" Finding a way to deal with the criticism became even more difficult in 1997 after Diana's death. Publicly, Charles focused on his sons William and Harry, and Camilla retreated out of view.â¯ But their relationship continued. Charles's position was that Camilla was non-negotiable in his life, and so began a carefully choreographed campaign to rehabilitate her in the public eye. It began with a late-night departure from the Ritz Hotel in 1999 where they had been celebrating Camilla's sister's 50th birthday. Six years later, they married in a small, civil ceremony at Windsor Guildhall.â¯ Charles and Camilla made their first official appearance as a couple by leaving a party together in 1999 Any concerns the couple might have had that the crowd might react negatively to the newly-weds proved unfounded, as they were greeted by cheers and applause from well-wishers. But for many years the debate continued over whether she would ever be known as Queen. While legally entitled to use the title, the official line had been that she would instead be known as Princess Consort, as a way to appease those who blamed her for the breakdown of Charles's marriage to Diana. In the end, the matter was settled by the Queen, who said in 2022 that it was her ""sincere wish that, when that time comes, Camilla will be known as Queen Consort"". Here was the confirmation that Camilla had earned her place by Charles's side. Any public debate was effectively ended. If the Queen was initially wary of Camilla, that must have been even more the case for Princes William and Harry. Both had to deal with the very public break-up of their parents' marriage, and then the death of their mother when William was 15 and Harry just 12. The couple married in a civil ceremony at Windsor Guildhall on 9 April 2005 In 2005, a few months after their wedding, an almost 21-year-old Harry said Camilla was a ""wonderful woman"" who had made their father very happy. ""William and I love her to bits and get on really well with her."" Little has been said by either brother about their feelings for Camilla in the years since. However, watching the interactions and body language between William, his wife Catherine, and Camilla at public engagements - there is a warmth and familiarity which suggests relations, with the Cambridges at least, are good. Camilla with her son Tom and daughter Laura from her marriage to Andrew Parker Bowles Camilla has become a key member of the Royal Family at events like the christening of Princess Charlotte in 2015 Now in her mid-70s, Camilla's life revolves around supporting her husband and her family. Her Windsor relations may generate the headlines, but away from the spotlight Camilla is also an enthusiastic grandmother of five. She has kept her Wiltshire home, Ray Mill House, where she escapes to relax. ""She has a very close and supportive family, and a close group of old friends,"" her nephewBen Elliott told Vanity Fair magazine.,external""She adores her husband, children and grandchildren."" Camilla has also made her own mark in areas about which she feels passionate - raising awareness about osteoporosis, which afflicted her mother and grandmother; pointing a spotlight on difficult subjects such as domestic abuse, rape and sexual violence; and seeking to pass on a love of books inherited from her father with a book club on Instagram. Perhaps because she came to royalty late in life, she seems almost embarrassed by the fuss that surrounds her.â¯ While covering a charity reception at Clarence House, I spotted the duchess poking her head round the corner at the top of the sweeping staircase, checking everyone was ready. Happy that we were, she came down and gave an enthusiastic hug and kiss to the charity's chief executive.â¯ During lockdown, the duchess spoke of her sadness at not being able to give her grandchildren a ""huge hug"". As restrictions eased, she clearly enjoyed being able to get back to her physically demonstrative self. Charles and Camilla are regularly seen laughing together at public engagements Watching her work a room, it is clear she can put people at their ease. She has made no secret of the fact she finds having to make speeches nerve-wracking, but she has grown in confidence over the years. Charles and Camilla have now been married for 17 years. In public, their connection is obvious. A shared look, a laugh - rarely is there an event where at some point they do not appear to be sharing a private joke. ""They love and respect each other and laugh at the same thing,"" Mr Elliott told Vanity Fair. They live lives of luxury but under the most intense scrutiny, and the pressure can be unrelenting. ""It's always nice to have somebody on your side,"" Prince Charles told broadcaster CNN in the run-up to their 10th wedding anniversary. ""She is an enormous support and sees the funny side of life, thank God."" ""Sometimes it's like ships passing in the night,"" she said of their life together, ""but we always sit down together and have a cup of tea and discuss the day. We have a moment."" The role of king is a solitary one - and Charles's reluctance to give up Camilla is perhaps because he knew she was the only person who could provide the companionship he will need in the role he is taking on.

which touched so many people. Over the past 10 days, we've been asking you to share your memories of seeing and meeting Queen Elizabeth II or to send in your personal tributes. Thousands of people have sent their own messages of condolence. ""The stories speak to how many people felt a personal connection to Her Majesty,"" says BBC Media and Arts Correspondent David Sillito. ""It reminds us that, while the official record of the life of the Queen will be a series of great moments of national pageantry, those were rare special occasions. ""Her life was much more about handshakes, birthday cards and meeting ordinary, but often remarkable, people. ""No-one forgets a conversation with the Queen. And our tributes page has been a little reminder that for hundreds of thousands of us, the Queen was more than a distant figure in a palace. She was someone with whom they felt a personal connection."" You can read more from David on the tributes here. Sibella Laing went to Cambridge University with King Charles III, has known the Royal Family since she was a child and has met the Queen. She was, is, and always has been, incredibly kind to everybody, always anxious to put people at their ease, always anxious to make you feel you are the only person in the room.  Iâm sure this huge support across the country that Charles must have been seeing will have been really inspirational and uplifting for him. He has had the Queen as a wonderful role model all his life and I think in a sense his whole life has been preparation for this, so I think he is ready for it."" Sibella Laing Dinkie Flowers in the queue to pay her respects to Queen Elizabeth II in Westminster Hall Dinkie Flowers (nee Stapleton), aged 101, queued for several hours on Saturday to pay her respects to Queen Elizabeth II. Dinkie, who lives in Shoreham-by-Sea is holding a letter she received from Buckingham Palace 70 years ago thanking her for her performance in the Celebrity Ice Show at Queens Ice Dance Club on 30 April 1952. Dinkie entertained other members of the public in the queue with some of her memorabilia including the card from Her Majesty for her 100th birthday in 2021. Lesley Tomlinson, Dinkie's hairdresser In Ghana students at Legon Hills International School paid tribute to her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II on the day of her funeral. The school held a special assembly reflecting her long reign. Pupils also wrote heartfelt condolence messages, while the little ones watched the Paddington film. Akua Agyemang, Founder of Legon Hills Internatonal School, Ghana The children wrote messages of farewell to the Queen Marie came to Windsor for the Queen's funeral with her friend Lee Stabler Marie Wood, 56, lived in Windsor for eight years when she was training to be a nurse and saw the Queen one day while out for a walk. Marie came to Windsor for the Queen's funeral on Monday, watching the procession from the Long Walk. I was walking in Great Park and she drove her Land Rover further up. I was just gobsmacked.  We always felt that she belonged here. This was her home. I am glad that she is in Windsor now, this was her favourite place. She will be missed."" Marie Wood Frances came from Italy to leave a portrait of the Queen drawn by her son Alex I have been living in Italy for the last 22 years. My son, Alex (13) drew this portrait of the Queen and I asked him if he wanted me to take it to London so I could leave it as a tribute for the Queen. He said yes.  On Saturday I got on a plane from Verona to come especially to leave the portrait before the funeral. Yesterday I took the 5.20am train from Havant to London and I left his portrait in Green Park. The policemen were very kind to take it for me as the park had already closed for laying flowers."" Frances King Simone Kennett was head teacher of Jersey College for Girls when the Queen visited to open a new building in 2001. The Queen said we had a beautiful school and that she had really enjoyed this visit. She made you feel as if you were important at that moment in her life. The students did the college proud and it was a successful visit.  We also had a light-hearted moment during the her visit. The Queen stamped her foot on the school's front terrace and said: 'This is hollow.' I said, 'Yes, Your Majesty, and if Your Majesty continues to bounce up and down she will find herself sitting in Home Economics,' and she absolutely roared with laughter!"" Simone Kennett, Former head of Jersey College for Girls Glyn Sherman, from Coventry, was serving in the Royal Horse Artillery in 1984 when as a guard of honour he met the Queen at a birthday parade. When she came along I said 'all right, Liz'? The top brass went to come down and she put her hand up to stop them, so I was lucky. I felt bad about it but had to explain to her that I've got a daughter called Elizabeth and it just came out like that.  She turned around and said 'I like to be unofficial sometimes'. It was brilliant. The memory will never go out of me.  Her death has left me heartbroken. I don't look at her as being Her Majesty. We call her our boss. Glyn Sherman I was born in 1926, a Londoner, and saw the Queen on the balcony with her parents on the day her father was crowned George VI. That memory is still very vivid in my mind. Beryl Smith Alicia Finn-OâShea, who is 10, met the Queen as a four-month-old baby. The family were so impressed by that encounter they named Alicia's little sister Elizabeth. She's now aged seven and prefers to be called Eliza, but they came to the Mall on Monday to watch the funeral procession with their mum Claire. It was really magical and amazing but also upsetting. The nice thought is the Queen is having marmalade sandwiches and tea with her family in heaven."" Alicia Finn-OâShea We arrived early from Birmingham to secure our place opposite Buckingham Palace gates to bid farewell to Her Majesty. We are really tired today but so happy we made it. It was an absolutely amazing day."" Claire Finn-O'Shea I used to make cakes and pastries for Her Majesty when I worked at Buckingham Palace from 2001 to 2002 and Sandringham from 2005 to 2006. I got really lucky. I did a modern apprenticeship under the patronage of the now King Charles III... On my days off I went and worked at Buckingham Palace two days a week. Over time I ended up working in the pastry kitchen and had the privilege of making some of the cakes and pastries that used to go out to the Queen during her teatime.  When I heard the news of the Queen's death I stepped outside for a good 10 minutes and really cried, I needed to get away from everyone. There are no Brits near me [in America] and so it's more of a challenge for people to understand what's going on.  It feels like more of a part of you has gone rather than a parent or relative. It feels a little bit of your identity has been lost. Kieron Hales Peter John Wailes, who served in the RAF for 25 years, met the Queen many times and headed to Windsor on the day of her funeral to pay his respects. The 63-year-old recalls how once at Buckingham Palace during a VJ Day parade the Queen noticed a veteran was struggling in the heat and ordered an officer to get them some water. âShe was fantastic and in charge of everything,â he says. Iâm here to pay respects to my ex-boss, I feel great respect for her and want to say thanks for everything - I enjoyed working for her and meeting her.â Peter John Wailes Paul Hayden and his sister handing flowers to the Queen during her visit to Essex My memory is a rather distant one: I think I was about five, and the Queen visited the Essex county show. I was photographed handing a bouquet of flowers to the Queen with my younger sister. Prince Phillip stood alongside the Queen. The photo ended up on the front page of the local newspaper and a framed photo was proudly displayed by my parents in their hallway for at least 20 years.  You can imagine the enjoyment all my friends (and my sister) have had over the years making fun of their once angelic mate and his little sister giving flowers to the Queen but I must admit to being rather proud of the occasion, particularly now.  Rest in Peace HRH Queen Elizabeth II."" Paul Hayden The Archbishop of York Stephen Cottrell shared a jigsaw puzzle and watched TV with the Queen at Sandringham. It was a great privilege to be alongside her. We sat down after dinner and did a jigsaw and the television was on.  It's a bereavement, and with every bereavement there is shock, there is loss but there is also thankfulness for a life lived well. A life of astonishing service. She was a person of simple but profound faith, and it was that faith that shaped her."" Archbishop of York Stephen Cottrell Raven Harlow Aspenwood is severely visually impaired and has channeled her grief into her portrait of the young Queen Elizabeth II I am registered severely visually impaired, but I felt compelled to do something to channel my overwhelming and surprising level of grief following the sad passing of HRH, Queen Elizabeth II. I think my strongest memory of the queen is how comforting her presence has been during every stage of my 28 years of life, when something difficult has happened she has comforted us with her words, when something wonderful has happened she has filled our hearts with joy, with her wonderful smile and calming presence. She has been the grandmother of our nation, the matriarch we all need in times of hardship and times of joy. Her dignity, strength and consistency has been a great comfort and I thank her for her seventy years of steadfast service. Raven Harlow Aspenwood from East Yorkshire What a smile. She could lift a room with that wonderful smile and that genuine interest that she has in the people of this country."" Warwickshire County Council Leader, Izzi Seccombe I do remember her smile, I experienced that myself. It not only lit up a room, it lit up a nation - and she had the capacity to make us smile too."" Bishop of Coventry, Reverend Christopher Cocksworth Zara Umar gave flowers to the Queen in 2002 My daughter Zara and I went down to the City Square in Dundee to see the Queen in 2002. We waited for a long time. Soon the time came and the Queen was walking towards us. She was about five or six steps away from us when one of her security personnel guided the Queen away to the car to leave. Zara was so disappointed and my heart sank. Just then a plain clothes man came and asked me if he could lift Zara over the barrier. Much to my delight, Zara presented the flowers to the Queen and said 'here you are then, take your flowers.' I couldnt believe it! The Queen must have found it funny though and watched Zara return to me with a big smile on her face. I will treasure this memory forever."" Ishrat Umar, Dundee Three army veterans from Worcestershire pay tribute to the Queen... She was our head, she was our leader, she was the person we were serving and she's the one that we would follow. It hits you, it hits your heart."" Eric Braithwaite, who served for 23 years with the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers Everyone called her the boss in one way or another. I've actually guarded the Queen and Prince Philip on other duties. A big lump in the throat, lost the boss, getting a new one."" Dave Sandy, who served in the territorial army from the late 1970s until the 1990s I've done a lot of parades for the Queen, she was a lovely lady and worked so hard for the country. I was in tears, I will be honest. It was an honour to be with her and be a soldier for her."" Anthony Goodway, who spent two years in national service from 1958 until 1960 I met the Queen when she visited the Isle of Skye as part of her Golden Jubilee tour. As a nurse then at the local care home, myself and other staff members were invited to bring some of our residents to meet Her Majesty. The great day came, our ladies looking beautiful, wheelchairs polished. One of our residents had worked at the palace as a younger woman and had photos of the Queen all around her room in the care home, so, if any one was to be there that day, it was her.  As the Queen approached our little group that day she asked me: âAre these the ladies from the care home?' I replied in the positive and then said this resident had worked in the palace. The Queen looked down a little and asked her: âWhen did you work at the palace?â To which, the lady looked up and and replied, in a rather gruff voice: âAnd who are you?â What a moment. I apologised. The Queen just smiled and moved on.  I was quite overwhelmed, I donât have photos of the Queen all over the house, but Iâve always respected her, especially as a Christian woman. She had a real true faith, so meeting her was very special. I didnât expect to be so overcome by the moment. Her demeanour was that of interest and she handled the situation really well. She left us all feeling very special and honoured. Barbara Matheson from Glasgow Barbara Matheson has recalled the moment she met the Queen during Her Majesty's Golden Jubilee tour Â© 2025 BBC.

'I see the Queen as my granny as well'People across Northern Ireland express their shock and sadness at the death of the Queen.,"Julie Stockman on the Shankill Road where people have been gathering in tribute to the Queen People across Northern Ireland have been reacting to the news of the Queen's death with many describing a sense of shock and loss. On Belfast's Shankill Road, a recently unveiled mural marking the Queen's Jubilee has become a focal point for the community's grief. Julie Stockman is one four local women who have booked flights to London to see the Queen's funeral cortÃ¨ge. ""We want to pay our respects. We loved the Queen and always will,"" she said. The Queen died at her Balmoral estate in Scotland on Thursday at the age of 96. Within minutes of her death being announced, people began laying flowers at the gates of Hillsborough Castle, her official residence in Northern Ireland. Some were close to tears, moved by the death of the only monarch they had known. Queen Elizabeth II stayed at Hillsborough Castle many times over the years. Edwin Parks put the union flag outside his house at half-mast. An emotional Mr Parks, a former presenter at BBC Radio Guernsey and ex-major in the Royal Horse Artillery, said it was ""a very, very sad day"". Hillsborough man Edwin Parks places the Union flag outside his house at half-mast Living just across the road from the castle, Mr Parks used to see Her Majesty ""every now and again"". ""She was a very lovely woman and I was very privileged to have met her on three or four occasions,"" he said. ""And one of the amazing things about her was that when you met her, without the cameras and all of that around, she was a very ordinary woman. ""I always used to say she reminds me of my mother. She was just the same sort of person - very informed. ""She had a wicked sense of humour - I mean a really, really wicked sense of humour which, away from the cameras, appeared the whole time. ""She was just a lovely person to talk to. ""She was part of Hillsborough. And presumably her son will continue to be part of Hillsborough."" Stephen Gilmore: ""One day you've a new prime minister, the next a new monarch"" Speaking at the castle gates, as people laid tributes while a light drizzle fell, Stephen Gilmore told BBC News NI he was ""very shocked"" by the Queen's death ""because we saw her on the TV yesterday appointing the new prime minister"". ""Yes, she was frail but she looked in good health - and today she's gone,"" he said. Mr Gilmore described Queen Elizabeth as ""a tremendous woman of faith and of leadership"". A clearly emotional Colin McCrory said he had travelled especially to Hillsborough to lay flowers. Colin McCrory, from the Shankill area of Belfast, travelled to Hillsborough to pay his respects ""It's just a day everyone expected but you never thought you'd see it,"" he said. ""My granny loved her. I was brought up loving her. There's a picture of the Queen in every single room in my house. ""It's just loyalty and devotion. She had it to the world and to the UK, and we had it to her."" Live: Northern Ireland reacts The Queen's delight on Irish visits Queen Elizabeth II: Island of Ireland pays tribute In pictures: Royal visits over the years Laura Porter, who was also at the castle to pay her respects, told BBC News NI: ""She's been the longest-reigning monarch and as a woman she is just so inspirational. ""After the past couple of years with her family, as well, they kind of put her through the rounds a little bit. I feel quite sad for her today but I think she's with Philip, the love of her life. ""She was a mother and she had a full time job as well. Many women can relate to that. ""And she was our servant too. I just heard today that she signed off in all her communications as 'Your servant' and that just means a lot to me."" Ms Porter expressed hope that everyone in Northern Ireland could come together to pay respect to Queen Elizabeth. Laura Porter: ""As a woman she is just so inspirational"" Lyndsey Gault, from Dromore, County Down, spoke of a sense of ""tremendous sadness for the nation"". She said she had come to Hillsborough to pay her respects to ""a godly lady"". ""Her service has been impeccable,"" she said. ""My granny would have remembered the Queen's coronation. This video can not be played Those laying flowers at Hillsborough Castle spoke of their admiration for the Queen ""And I would almost see the Queen as my granny as well. I think a lot of people would. You know, she is the nation's granny."" In Londonderry's Fountain Estate, there was a sombre, reflective mood. Community worker Jeanette Warke was awarded an MBE by the Queen in 1999. ""I will always remember that day and I will never forget that lady,"" Ms Warke told BBC Radio Foyle on Friday. Jeanette Warke says meeting the Queen in 1999 was a day she will never forget ""It was just a privilege to stand before her and look into her eyes. ""She made every single person feel the same way, you feel as if you're the only one in that room and that is so special - it's not just simply handing over a medal. ""She actually knew the work that I did and it's just something I'll never forget."" The union flag flying at half-mast over Belfast City Hall Tributes were paid on the Shankill Road in Belfast with a recently unveiled Jubilee mural a focal point for the community's grief On the Shankill Road in Belfast, many local residents expressed their grief. Community development worker, Stacey Graham, lay flowers with her husband and children and said the experience was ""really really moving"". ""I'm showing my respect because I'm British and I love the Queen. We had helped organise the Jubilee mural that everybody is now using as a focal point for their grief,"" she said. Stacey Graham said she was moved by the tributes on the Shankill Road ""It's only right that we come down and remember such an amazing, admirable woman. ""Her grace to the very end was just unbelievable and I don't think we'll ever see another lady like her again.""

""Queen Elizabeth lived a life of dedicated public service - at no small personal cost to herself,""  he said, Hr called her ""a model of

Foundation, Dr SÃ©an Farran, has extended the foundation's condolences to the Queen's family ""and to all who regarded
her as their sovereign, especially those in Northern Ireland"". ""Her long reign witnessed many changes and developments
in British-Irish relationships,"" Dr Farren, a former NI Executive minister, said.

Queen Elizabeth II with her racing manager after her horse, Estimate, won the Gold Cup at Royal Ascot in 2013 Among the Queen's most well-known passions was horse racing. The outpouring from the horse racing community has been strong and emotional. Legendary jockey Sir Tony McCoy, better known as AP McCoy, led the tributes on BBC's Evening Extra programme. ""She was a hugely successful owner and breeder for pretty much all her life and she brought so much interest to it,"" he says.

Queen Elizabeth II with her corgis watching the Royal Windsor Horse Show in 1973 She only missed Royal Ascot for the first time in June 2022. ""I was lucky enough to spend some time with her and she made you feel very at ease - that was one of her special traits. ""She also had a real sense of humour,"" he adds. Sir Tony did not go to Buckingham Palace to get his MBE in 2002 as he was racing on the day and when he came to get his OBE she said ""nice of you to come along this time"". ""I apologised but she told me she got the Racing Post and knew why I had not been there."" A Belfast schoolboy has received his own little bit of treasure from the palace. It's been a week of highs and lows for 11-year-old James Patterson - a mixture of joy and sorrow. Last June, James decided to write to the Queen to wish her well on her Platinum Jubilee. ""I just wanted to congratulate her,"" he told BBC News NI. Imagine his surprise when, on Wednesday, a card with a special postmark landed on the doorstep. It had the royal crest on it. 

Inside was a picture of the Queen and on the back a picture of her in a more relaxed style. wearing a headscarf. ""She's such a good person and I was so surprised to get the card,"" said James. ""I felt really good. but then I was so sad to hear she had died."" Florence
Walker in Ballinamallard, County Fermanagh, has been looking at photographs of the
Royal Visit to the village in 2004, during the Queenâs Golden Jubilee. Florence

humour and they all had a good laugh over that and many of them remembered
that."" She had a great sense of humour, great twinkle in her eyes and a beautiful smile and she put everybody at ease.â  Florence also recalled the historic visit to Enniskillen during the Diamond Jubilee when the Queen crossed the street from St Macartinâs Church of Ireland Cathedral to St Michaelâs Roman Catholic Church. ""It was lovely the way she was received by all of the community and I think thatâs the one thing about her, she was the Queen of us all.â Tidying up of larger towns in the Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council area will begin tomorrow after negotiations with unions over strike action that has affected bin collections.

BBC News NI headed to Belfast's Shankill Road where there are many murals of the Queen, and she is held dearly in the hearts of the people who live there.  This video can not be played 'We are her most loyal subjects' - people on Belfast's Shankill Road react Among the thousands gathered outside Buckingham Palace, where the standard is flying and the King is in residence, is William Holland from Belfast. âItâs
sad that Elizabeth has passed away but Charles has waited a long time for this
moment. He now takes the throneâ¦ so I have mixed emotions,â he said. âThe
crowds here are tremendous. The amount of people is scary. ""The
rain hasnât put people off and the amount of different cultures here  it is
really international.â William said it would be strange now that the Queen has died. âShe
has been the Queen as long as I can remember, time will tell how it will affect
me. âWeâll
see how good a job Charles does.â Taoiseach MicheÃ¡l Martin
and Prime Minister Liz Truss spoke by phone this afternoon, with Mr Martin extending his condolences to the UK government, King Charles
III and the Royal Family, and the British people on the loss of Queen
Elizabeth II. He also discussed the Queen's historic state visit to Ireland in 2011 and its contribution
to advancing reconciliation and relations between the two countries.  The taoiseach also offered his congratulations to the prime minister on her appointment, and discussed a number of issues including the war in Ukraine and the Northern Ireland Protocol. They agreed to keep in close contact in the weeks ahead. Former Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader and Northern Ireland first minister Dame Arlene Foster says the Queen took a tremendous interest in Northern Ireland. ""Her work on reconciliation will probably be one of the key
parts of her legacy going forward,"" she says. Mrs Foster recalled meeting the Queen shortly after becoming first minister. ""When I met her in 2016 we had just left the Euros, we had just been beaten by Wales, and we had a conversation about that,"" she said. ""But it was very, very open - she put us all at ease, obviously realising that in my case I was a new first minister who was probably quite anxious about meeting Her Majesty The Queen. It was a memory I will cherish for as long as I live."" Dame Arlene Foster, Former NI first minister Instrumental in arranging the monumental meeting between the Queen and Sinn FÃ©in's Martin McGuinness, was Peter Sheridan, the chief executive of Co-operation Ireland. He tells BBC's Evening Extra that the meeting had been influenced by her state visit the year before to the Republic of Ireland and how well it had gone. ""I don't think anyone could have imagined it ever happening. It was extraordinary in the nature of it,"" he explains. ""I was feet away from it and I remember thinking I was going to watch it in slow motion to capture the moment,"" he says. However he says one thing that struck him was how ""ordinary"" it was at the same time. ""Here were two people who met, smiled and shook hands, something we all do as humans every day despite the significance of it,"" he says. ""The Queen achieved so much in Anglo-Irish relations on these islands and her own determination to pursue reconciliation was clear from her speech in Dublin Castle - to bow to the past but not be bound by it. Too often many of us are still bound by it, holding us back from better relations on these islands."" Peter Sheridan, Co-operation Ireland Peter Sheridan meets The Queen ""But - it's impossible not to recognise the historical significance of that moment,"" he says. Was it her biggest legacy? ""The Queen achieved so much in Anglo-Irish relations on these islands and her own determination to pursue reconciliation was clear from her speech in Dublin Castle - to bow to the past but not be bound by it,"" he says ""Too often many of us are still bound by it holding us back from better relations on these islands.""

One person who got many birthday cards from the Queen, was Ethel Barbour from Limavady, who died aged 106, less than three months from her 107th birthday, in April 2020. Her daughter, Miriam Stewart, from Coleraine, sent in a picture of her first 100th birthday card she received in 2013, with great grandson Reuben, and a picture of the last card she received before she died. Miriam says her mum loved the Queen and her parents, and indeed, the Queenâs grandmother, Queen Mary. Though, she added, ""she wasnât above criticising the occasional royal who did something she disapproved of"". ""She often talked of the radio broadcasts by the Queen's father during World War Two, and gave them great credit for staying in London with their people."" She also met the Queen's sister, Princess Margaret, when she visited Limavady in 1963, and was given the job of entertaining her. She met the Queen when she accompanied her husband to Buckingham Palace when he got the MBE in 1981.

Peter Robinson, Former NI first minister The Queen was ""prepared to go the second mile, she was an encourager all the way"" for the peace process in Northern Ireland, former first minister Peter Robinson told Radio Ulster. In his role, he met the Queen on a number of occasions and also got to know her in private audiences. ""She was a wonderful person, she was driven by faith and duty,"" he said. ""Those who met her personally found that infectious spirit she had."" When the cameras were not around, Mr Robinson said that he found she had been ""well briefed"" and had a """"really acute inquiring mind"". ""She went for the kind of areas you weren't expecting. She'd ask: What is it like to work with him?"" he said. This was not just about Sinn FÃ©in's Martin McGuinness, the late deputy first minister, but other politicians well known in Northern Ireland, he said. Speaking about the historic handshake between Her Majesty and Mr McGuinness, he said: ""It wasn't an easy occasion for either of the two individuals. ""There was a lot of history on both sides. It was an important part of our overall process.  The flag at the Irish Embassy in London has been lowered to half-mast. On Thursday, flags outside government buildings in the Republic of Ireland were lowered to half-mast. Taoiseach (Irish PM) MicheÃ¡l Martin said that the Queen's death marked the ""end of an era"".

Against medical advice, the King went to the airport to see the couple off. It was to be the last time Elizabeth, then just 25 years old, would see her father. She heard the news of his death while staying at a game lodge in Kenya and immediately returned to London as the Queen. She later recalled: ""In a way, I didn't have an apprenticeship. My father died much too young, so it was all a very sudden kind of taking on and making the best job you can.â Queen Elizabeth II returns to England Welsh politicians will be recalled to the Senedd - the Welsh

""One of the reasons we got them was because the Queen had them,"" she said, pushing a pram with two corgis patiently sitting inside. The Queen was known for her love of corgis dating back to when she was a child, and kept dozens of them over the course of her 70-year reign. Read more abouthow the Queen's love of corgis started a global phenomenon On Saturday, Windsor Castle became the site of a rare joint appearance by the new Prince of Wales, William, with his brother Prince Harry, and their wives. It is a building that had deep significance to the monarch throughout her life - a place of work but also her own private retreat. The Queen's special association with Windsor Castle began when she was a child. 
The then-Princess Elizabeth and her family made Royal Lodge - a mansion in the grounds of the Windsor Estate - their weekend country home. The first instinct of many mourning the death of Queen Elizabeth II has been to leave flowers at Windsor Castle.  At the age of 14, the then-princess and her sister Margaret were sent to the castle for much of World War Two while their home in London faced the threat of being bombed. The castle has been inhabited continuously by 40 monarchs across almost 1,000 years. With 1,000 rooms, 13 acres (five hectares) of grounds and reminders of its rich history amid the gothic architecture, it is little wonder the Queen saw the castle as a sanctuary.

From world leaders to members of the public, people reflected on Her Majesty's legacy. Tributes for the Queen have poured in from statesmen around the world, and on Saturday, the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken was the latest to issue his  condolences. On Twitter, Blinken posted a photo from the US embassy in Washington, thanking the Queen for her ""steadfast leadership"" and ""unwavering commitment to service"". Dame Karen Pierce, the UK ambassador to the US, thanked Blinken for the message, calling the Queen ""our foremost diplomat"" and ""active supporter"" of the two countries' ""special relationship"" - a phrase that had been coined by her first prime minister, Churchill.

Katty KayUS special correspondent Queen Elizabeth and Ronald Reagan ride horses in Windsor Home Park in 1982 US presidents wield hard power. They control the
biggest military in the world and its richest country. Yet,
one after one, they would walk into Buckingham Palace and go jelly-kneed. This
diminutive woman reduced powerful presidents to grinning school boys. She traded scone recipes with Dwight Eisenhower, danced
with Gerald Ford and rode with Ronald Reagan. Somehow she managed to find a way to
connect with each of them, not just as a fellow head of state, but as a person. The one president who, according to someone who worked
for him, didn't go into his first meeting with the Queen already star struck
was Barack Obama. Apparently he rather resisted the ""hype,"" as
this staffer put it. But then he met her. And, like the 11 presidents
before him, he, too, was won over. Indeed, the two developed such a good
relationship that the Queen reportedly asked him to come and visit even after
he left office. I'm told that what changed the 44th president's view was her
sense of responsibility and duty - she was, in Obama language, a no-drama
Queen. US presidents often have a keen sense of history and all those years on the throne wasn't lost on them. As a long day draws to a close in the UK, let's look back at what happened today: Charles III was proclaimed kingby the Accession Council in a ceremony at St James's Palace in London.Read more here. In Balmoral, three of the Queen's children -Princess Anne, Prince Andrew and Prince Edward -attended a church service along with other members of the royal family, and stopped to greet well-wishers outside the gates of Balmoral. Details of the Queen's funeral were announced- it will take place at 11am on Monday, 19 September at Westminster Abbey.Get more details here.

King Charlesheld audiences with ministers and met opposition politicians at Buckingham Palace. Princes Harry and William, joined by their wives,delighted crowds as they went for a walkabout in Windsor, collecting floral tributes and meeting some of those who turned out to pay their respects.Watch the moment here. The Queen was a big part of the community in the village near Balmoral, says the church minister Balmoral, the Scottish castle where the Queen died, was the place where she ""enjoyed being normal"", according to royal historian Robert Lacey, So it's no surprise thatpeople in the nearby village of Ballater remember her with special affection. ""She was not just our Queen, she was a neighbour - and a big part of this community,"" says Rev David Barr at Glenmuick Church in the village. Alistair Cassie, who runs a hardware shop in Ballater and has a royal warrant for supplying Balmoral with its televisions, remembered being called to the castle to fix interference with the radio. The Royal Banner of Scotland flies at half-mast at Balmoral Castle ""I was walking along this corridor, and who did I meet but the Queen,"" he says. They chatted about her appreciation for the BBC Radio 2 presenter Jimmy Young. The sprawling Balmoral Estate includes dozens of houses, many occupied by estate staff, and Cassie says at times the Queen would appear unannounced at someone's home, asking: ""How are you doing?"" Grant Harrold, a former butler to King Charles when he was Prince of Wales, says the Queen and Prince Philip would sometimes stay at a small cottage on the estate. He says: ""From what I was told - I never witnessed it - she would be in the kitchen cooking away and he would lay the table, so it was very much a chance for them to be a normal couple."" Alistair Cassie met the Queen on a formal visit - and unexpectedly in the corridor of the castle Crowds continued to form at Buckingham Palace on Saturday night as people paid tribute to the Queen Many took photos at the gates, where flowers have been left in memory of the monarch Six-year-old Penelope is among the people to have left tributes for the Queen near the palace As the nation continues to mourn the death of Queen Elizabeth II, here's what we know about the plans for tomorrow:  Sean CoughlanBBC News, royal correspondent Headline writers will be thinking about ""Brothers in arms"" or maybe ""Brothers in grief"" for their coverage. The sight of Princes William and Harry meeting the crowds together will become one of the stand-out and most unexpected images from what have been sombre days. With their wives, Catherine and Meghan, they greeted people in Windsor, in a way that couldn't have been predicted last week, when the Sussexes returned to the UK. The talk then was of feuds and unbridgeable differences between couples. They were said to be staying in houses close together on the Windsor estate, while emotionally many miles apart. The couple hadn't been seen together in public for more than two years. That all changed on Thursday. If William and Harry were not planning to see each other, they were brought together in ways that couldn't have been predicted.

Chi Chi IzunduReporting from Washington DC A
small group of people were making their way to the British Embassy in
Washington DC to lay flowers and read some of the messages that people had
left. Dignitaries
are expected to continue to make their way to the embassy and pay their
respects. Wanita Harris-Wise was
carrying a small bunch of flowers and wanted to go and show her respects to the
monarch. âQueen Elizabeth was all we
knew growing up. Iâm 64 years of age and when you thought of the Queen thatâs
who the Queen was. We call our children princesses. We want our children to

     here in the capital of Canada, Ottawa. Justin Trudeau and his
     son walked slowly up to Rideau Hall, the residency of the Governor
     General, Mary Simon - she is the representative of the monarch in Canada
     and the first indigenous person to hold that position. Itâs a quiet residency
     just out of town. Wild turkeys walk around the grounds and among the
     trees, some of which have been planted by royals. There are 14
     commonwealth realms in addition to the UK. A realm is a country whose
     monarch is the King. Canada is one of the realms and today, like in the
     UK, there was an official proclamation of the King. Trumpets sounded, the
     doors opened and the Chief Herald walked out of Rideau Hall to announce
     the King of Canada. Firstly in English and then in French, with Trudeau at
     his side, Samy Khalid, proclaimed His Royal Highness Prince Charles III,
     King. Cannon shots were fired,
     flags were raised and Guardsmen marched among the small crowd that had
     gathered.  Tributes for Queen Elizabeth II are continuing to pour in from around the world. Oliver Atkin from Bromley says he remembers meeting the monarch on the Balmoral estate in 2012 while on a family day out. She ""walked straight up to us and said hello.

She was hosted by Belfast native Mary McAleese, the then president of Ireland. Mrs McAleese described the four-day trip as ""magical"" and said the Queen had made a ""very special pilgrimage of reconciliation"". During the visit, the Queen laid a wreath in Dublin's Garden of Remembrance - a park dedicated to Irish people who fought against British rule. She also spoke a few words in Irish at a state dinner in Dublin Castle, the former seat of British power in Ireland. A moment of reflection during the Queen's visit to Ireland in May 2011 Speaking to the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme, Mrs McAleese said the Queen was a person who transcended politics and who was ""deeply respected"" by people from different backgrounds and political persuasions. ""Many, many people across the island who would not be supporters of the idea of monarchy, for example people who would be republicans, and many Irish nationalists would share with me deep sorrow at her passing, because she was always a woman who was worthy of respect,"" the former president said. ""Why? Because she earned that respect over seven decades."" The 2011 visit was ""an extraordinary moment"" in British-Irish relations, according to the Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs, Simon Coveney. At the time, Mr Coveney escorted the Queen on a walkabout around the English Market in his native Cork. The Queen visited the English Market in Cork in 2011, accompanied by Simon Coveney (right) He told the BBC's Talkback's programme the royal guest ""managed to charm an entire country"" during her trip. ""And she addressed the British-Irish relationship in terms of our history - with all its tragedy, but with all it's closeness - in a way that really I think resulted in so many Irish people seeing her with a new affection. ""It was just one of her many achievements over 70 years of an extraordinary reign."" The following year, the Queen broke new ground in herfirst meeting with the then deputy first minister, and former IRA commander, Martin McGuinness. Speaking to Evening Extra, the former first minister Peter Robinson recalled his memories of the historic handshake. ""I felt that she very strongly wanted to make a contribution. She felt we were on the right path, that the kind of reconciliation and way forward that we were moving was something that was worthy of her support,"" he said. ""She showed that by her own endeavours in Northern Ireland as well as her visit to the south. This video can not be played Former First Minister Peter Robinson speaks to BBC Radio Ulster's Evening Extra about his memories of the Queen ""It wasn't an easy occasion for either of the two individuals because there was a lot of history on both sides. I think it was an important part of our overall process."" Mr Robinson said Mr McGuinness ""did take some flak"" from some people around him over the occasions he met the Queen. ""It wasn't always an easy thing for republicans to do but I think it did just indicate that we were moving on in Northern Ireland,"" he added.

Against medical advice, the King went to the airport to see the couple off. It was to be the last time Elizabeth, then just 25 years old, would see her father. She heard the news of his death while staying at a game lodge in Kenya and immediately returned to London as the Queen. She later recalled: ""In a way, I didn't have an apprenticeship. My father died much too young, so it was all a very sudden kind of taking on and making the best job you can.â Queen Elizabeth II returns to England Welsh politicians will be recalled to the Senedd - the Welsh

""One of the reasons we got them was because the Queen had them,"" she said, pushing a pram with two corgis patiently sitting inside. The Queen was known for her love of corgis dating back to when she was a child, and kept dozens of them over the course of her 70-year reign. Read more abouthow the Queen's love of corgis started a global phenomenon On Saturday, Windsor Castle became the site of a rare joint appearance by the new Prince of Wales, William, with his brother Prince Harry, and their wives. It is a building that had deep significance to the monarch throughout her life - a place of work but also her own private retreat. The Queen's special association with Windsor Castle began when she was a child. 
The then-Princess Elizabeth and her family made Royal Lodge - a mansion in the grounds of the Windsor Estate - their weekend country home. The first instinct of many mourning the death of Queen Elizabeth II has been to leave flowers at Windsor Castle.  At the age of 14, the then-princess and her sister Margaret were sent to the castle for much of World War Two while their home in London faced the threat of being bombed. The castle has been inhabited continuously by 40 monarchs across almost 1,000 years. With 1,000 rooms, 13 acres (five hectares) of grounds and reminders of its rich history amid the gothic architecture, it is little wonder the Queen saw the castle as a sanctuary.

From world leaders to members of the public, people reflected on Her Majesty's legacy.

On Twitter, Blinken posted a photo from the US embassy in Washington, thanking the Queen for her ""steadfast leadership"" and ""unwavering commitment to service"". Dame Karen Pierce, the UK ambassador to the US, thanked Blinken for the message, calling the Queen ""our foremost diplomat"" and ""active supporter"" of the two countries' ""special relationship"" - a phrase that had been coined by her first prime minister, Churchill.

Katty KayUS special correspondent Queen Elizabeth and Ronald Reagan ride horses in Windsor Home Park in 1982 US presidents wield hard power. They control the
biggest military in the world and its richest country. Yet,
one after one, they would walk into Buckingham Palace and go jelly-kneed. This
diminutive woman reduced powerful presidents to grinning school boys. She traded scone recipes with Dwight Eisenhower, danced
with Gerald Ford and rode with Ronald Reagan. Somehow she managed to find a way to
connect with each of them, not just as a fellow head of state, but as a person. The one president who, according to someone who worked
for him, didn't go into his first meeting with the Queen already star struck
was Barack Obama. Apparently he rather resisted the ""hype,"" as
this staffer put it. But then he met her. And, like the 11 presidents
before him, he, too, was won over. Indeed, the two developed such a good
relationship that the Queen reportedly asked him to come and visit even after
he left office. I'm told that what changed the 44th president's view was her
sense of responsibility and duty - she was, in Obama language, a no-drama
Queen. US presidents often have a keen sense of history and all those years on the throne wasn't lost on them. As a long day draws to a close in the UK, let's look back at what happened today: Charles III was proclaimed kingby the Accession Council in a ceremony at St James's Palace in London.Read more here. In Balmoral, three of the Queen's children -Princess Anne, Prince Andrew and Prince Edward -attended a church service along with other members of the royal family, and stopped to greet well-wishers outside the gates of Balmoral. Details of the Queen's funeral were announced- it will take place at 11am on Monday, 19 September at Westminster Abbey.Get more details here.

Princes Harry and William, joined by their wives,delighted crowds as they went for a walkabout in Windsor, collecting floral tributes and meeting some of those who turned out to pay their respects.Watch the moment here. The Queen was a big part of the community in the village near Balmoral, says the church minister Balmoral, the Scottish castle where the Queen died, was the place where she ""enjoyed being normal"", according to royal historian Robert Lacey, So it's no surprise thatpeople in the nearby village of Ballater remember her with special affection. ""She was not just our Queen, she was a neighbour - and a big part of this community,"" says Rev David Barr at Glenmuick Church in the village. Alistair Cassie, who runs a hardware shop in Ballater and has a royal warrant for supplying Balmoral with its televisions, remembered being called to the castle to fix interference with the radio. The Royal Banner of Scotland flies at half-mast at Balmoral Castle ""I was walking along this corridor, and who did I meet but the Queen,"" he says. They chatted about her appreciation for the BBC Radio 2 presenter Jimmy Young. The sprawling Balmoral Estate includes dozens of houses, many occupied by estate staff, and Cassie says at times the Queen would appear unannounced at someone's home, asking: ""How are you doing?"" Grant Harrold, a former butler to King Charles when he was Prince of Wales, says the Queen and Prince Philip would sometimes stay at a small cottage on the estate. He says: ""From what I was told - I never witnessed it - she would be in the kitchen cooking away and he would lay the table, so it was very much a chance for them to be a normal couple."" Alistair Cassie met the Queen on a formal visit - and unexpectedly in the corridor of the castle Crowds continued to form at Buckingham Palace on Saturday night as people paid tribute to the Queen Many took photos at the gates, where flowers have been left in memory of the monarch Six-year-old Penelope is among the people to have left tributes for the Queen near the palace As the nation continues to mourn the death of Queen Elizabeth II, here's what we know about the plans for tomorrow:  Sean CoughlanBBC News, royal correspondent Headline writers will be thinking about ""Brothers in arms"" or maybe ""Brothers in grief"" for their coverage. The sight of Princes William and Harry meeting the crowds together will become one of the stand-out and most unexpected images from what have been sombre days. With their wives, Catherine and Meghan, they greeted people in Windsor, in a way that couldn't have been predicted last week, when the Sussexes returned to the UK. The talk then was of feuds and unbridgeable differences between couples. They were said to be staying in houses close together on the Windsor estate, while emotionally many miles apart. The couple hadn't been seen together in public for more than two years. That all changed on Thursday. If William and Harry were not planning to see each other, they were brought together in ways that couldn't have been predicted.

     commonwealth realms in addition to the UK. A realm is a country whose

Russia currently has heavy economic sanctions imposed on it by Western nations, including the UK, because of its invasion of Ukraine. Prince Philip, followed by the Queen, and Jordan's King Hussein and Queen Noor visiting the Petra archaeological site in 1984 African leaders also shared tributes for Queen Elizabeth - who knew many of them well and, as the head of the Commonwealth, was sympathetic to their cause. Kenyan President-elect William Ruto praised her ""historic legacy"" and said Kenyans would ""miss the cordial ties she enjoyed"" with the country. Kenya, a former British colony that became independent in 1963, was a very special place for the monarch. For a start, it was where she became Queen. The young princess, then just 25 years old, was on holiday there when her father, King George VI, died in his sleep in 1952. President Ali Bongo Ondimba of Gabon, which is one of the newest nations to join the Commonwealth, said: ""The Queen was a great friend of Africa and Africa showed her affection in return."" And Ghana's President Nana Akufo-Addo tweeted that his country had fond memories of the two visits the Queen made, remarking on ""her friendliness, elegance, style and sheer joy she brought to the performance of her duties"". Her first trip to Ghana, also a former British colony, was controversial and there were concerns for the monarch's safety. Five days earlier, bombs had gone off in the capital, Accra, but the Queen was not deterred, in part because she had already cancelled a previous visit when she became pregnant with Prince Andrew. Kenya was always a special place for Queen Elizabeth - shown here alongside President Daniel arap Moi during a state visit in 1983 Â© 2025 BBC.

have the honour to write the closing message on this page of thousands of
tributes to Queen Elizabeth II. And itâs a message of thanks to every single
person who has taken the time to share their story. When the death of Queen Elizabeth was
announced, we at the BBC wanted to create a place where people could come
together to share their tributes, their photos and recollections. The
response has been incredible. We have received thousands of touching stories of
meeting the Queen, special moments, memories and messages of condolence. Thank you to everyone - from all
over the world - for coming together here in this virtual space for very real
acts a of remembrance. Looking at the contributions, the
common theme that emerges is that the Queen had a way of making each person she
met feel like the most important person in that moment. Thank you again for helping us remember
a woman whose promise to serve her people was fulfilled through a life of duty,
which touched so many people. Over the past 10 days, we've been asking you to share your memories of seeing and meeting Queen Elizabeth II or to send in your personal tributes. Thousands of people have sent their own messages of condolence. ""The stories speak to how many people felt a personal connection to Her Majesty,"" says BBC Media and Arts Correspondent David Sillito. ""It reminds us that, while the official record of the life of the Queen will be a series of great moments of national pageantry, those were rare special occasions. ""Her life was much more about handshakes, birthday cards and meeting ordinary, but often remarkable, people. ""No-one forgets a conversation with the Queen. And our tributes page has been a little reminder that for hundreds of thousands of us, the Queen was more than a distant figure in a palace. She was someone with whom they felt a personal connection."" You can read more from David on the tributes here. Sibella Laing went to Cambridge University with King Charles III, has known the Royal Family since she was a child and has met the Queen. She was, is, and always has been, incredibly kind to everybody, always anxious to put people at their ease, always anxious to make you feel you are the only person in the room.  Iâm sure this huge support across the country that Charles must have been seeing will have been really inspirational and uplifting for him. He has had the Queen as a wonderful role model all his life and I think in a sense his whole life has been preparation for this, so I think he is ready for it."" Sibella Laing Dinkie Flowers in the queue to pay her respects to Queen Elizabeth II in Westminster Hall Dinkie Flowers (nee Stapleton), aged 101, queued for several hours on Saturday to pay her respects to Queen Elizabeth II. Dinkie, who lives in Shoreham-by-Sea is holding a letter she received from Buckingham Palace 70 years ago thanking her for her performance in the Celebrity Ice Show at Queens Ice Dance Club on 30 April 1952. Dinkie entertained other members of the public in the queue with some of her memorabilia including the card from Her Majesty for her 100th birthday in 2021. Lesley Tomlinson, Dinkie's hairdresser In Ghana students at Legon Hills International School paid tribute to her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II on the day of her funeral. The school held a special assembly reflecting her long reign. Pupils also wrote heartfelt condolence messages, while the little ones watched the Paddington film. Akua Agyemang, Founder of Legon Hills Internatonal School, Ghana The children wrote messages of farewell to the Queen Marie came to Windsor for the Queen's funeral with her friend Lee Stabler Marie Wood, 56, lived in Windsor for eight years when she was training to be a nurse and saw the Queen one day while out for a walk. Marie came to Windsor for the Queen's funeral on Monday, watching the procession from the Long Walk. I was walking in Great Park and she drove her Land Rover further up. I was just gobsmacked.  We always felt that she belonged here. This was her home. I am glad that she is in Windsor now, this was her favourite place. She will be missed."" Marie Wood Frances came from Italy to leave a portrait of the Queen drawn by her son Alex I have been living in Italy for the last 22 years. My son, Alex (13) drew this portrait of the Queen and I asked him if he wanted me to take it to London so I could leave it as a tribute for the Queen. He said yes.  On Saturday I got on a plane from Verona to come especially to leave the portrait before the funeral. Yesterday I took the 5.20am train from Havant to London and I left his portrait in Green Park. The policemen were very kind to take it for me as the park had already closed for laying flowers."" Frances King Simone Kennett was head teacher of Jersey College for Girls when the Queen visited to open a new building in 2001. The Queen said we had a beautiful school and that she had really enjoyed this visit. She made you feel as if you were important at that moment in her life. The students did the college proud and it was a successful visit.  We also had a light-hearted moment during the her visit. The Queen stamped her foot on the school's front terrace and said: 'This is hollow.' I said, 'Yes, Your Majesty, and if Your Majesty continues to bounce up and down she will find herself sitting in Home Economics,' and she absolutely roared with laughter!"" Simone Kennett, Former head of Jersey College for Girls Glyn Sherman, from Coventry, was serving in the Royal Horse Artillery in 1984 when as a guard of honour he met the Queen at a birthday parade. When she came along I said 'all right, Liz'? The top brass went to come down and she put her hand up to stop them, so I was lucky. I felt bad about it but had to explain to her that I've got a daughter called Elizabeth and it just came out like that.  She turned around and said 'I like to be unofficial sometimes'. It was brilliant. The memory will never go out of me.  Her death has left me heartbroken. I don't look at her as being Her Majesty. We call her our boss. Glyn Sherman I was born in 1926, a Londoner, and saw the Queen on the balcony with her parents on the day her father was crowned George VI. That memory is still very vivid in my mind. Beryl Smith Alicia Finn-OâShea, who is 10, met the Queen as a four-month-old baby. The family were so impressed by that encounter they named Alicia's little sister Elizabeth. She's now aged seven and prefers to be called Eliza, but they came to the Mall on Monday to watch the funeral procession with their mum Claire. It was really magical and amazing but also upsetting. The nice thought is the Queen is having marmalade sandwiches and tea with her family in heaven."" Alicia Finn-OâShea We arrived early from Birmingham to secure our place opposite Buckingham Palace gates to bid farewell to Her Majesty. We are really tired today but so happy we made it. It was an absolutely amazing day."" Claire Finn-O'Shea I used to make cakes and pastries for Her Majesty when I worked at Buckingham Palace from 2001 to 2002 and Sandringham from 2005 to 2006. I got really lucky. I did a modern apprenticeship under the patronage of the now King Charles III... On my days off I went and worked at Buckingham Palace two days a week. Over time I ended up working in the pastry kitchen and had the privilege of making some of the cakes and pastries that used to go out to the Queen during her teatime.  When I heard the news of the Queen's death I stepped outside for a good 10 minutes and really cried, I needed to get away from everyone. There are no Brits near me [in America] and so it's more of a challenge for people to understand what's going on.  It feels like more of a part of you has gone rather than a parent or relative. It feels a little bit of your identity has been lost. Kieron Hales Peter John Wailes, who served in the RAF for 25 years, met the Queen many times and headed to Windsor on the day of her funeral to pay his respects. The 63-year-old recalls how once at Buckingham Palace during a VJ Day parade the Queen noticed a veteran was struggling in the heat and ordered an officer to get them some water. âShe was fantastic and in charge of everything,â he says. Iâm here to pay respects to my ex-boss, I feel great respect for her and want to say thanks for everything - I enjoyed working for her and meeting her.â Peter John Wailes Paul Hayden and his sister handing flowers to the Queen during her visit to Essex My memory is a rather distant one: I think I was about five, and the Queen visited the Essex county show. I was photographed handing a bouquet of flowers to the Queen with my younger sister. Prince Phillip stood alongside the Queen. The photo ended up on the front page of the local newspaper and a framed photo was proudly displayed by my parents in their hallway for at least 20 years.  You can imagine the enjoyment all my friends (and my sister) have had over the years making fun of their once angelic mate and his little sister giving flowers to the Queen but I must admit to being rather proud of the occasion, particularly now.  Rest in Peace HRH Queen Elizabeth II."" Paul Hayden The Archbishop of York Stephen Cottrell shared a jigsaw puzzle and watched TV with the Queen at Sandringham. It was a great privilege to be alongside her. We sat down after dinner and did a jigsaw and the television was on.  It's a bereavement, and with every bereavement there is shock, there is loss but there is also thankfulness for a life lived well. A life of astonishing service. She was a person of simple but profound faith, and it was that faith that shaped her."" Archbishop of York Stephen Cottrell Raven Harlow Aspenwood is severely visually impaired and has channeled her grief into her portrait of the young Queen Elizabeth II I am registered severely visually impaired, but I felt compelled to do something to channel my overwhelming and surprising level of grief following the sad passing of HRH, Queen Elizabeth II. I think my strongest memory of the queen is how comforting her presence has been during every stage of my 28 years of life, when something difficult has happened she has comforted us with her words, when something wonderful has happened she has filled our hearts with joy, with her wonderful smile and calming presence. She has been the grandmother of our nation, the matriarch we all need in times of hardship and times of joy. Her dignity, strength and consistency has been a great comfort and I thank her for her seventy years of steadfast service. Raven Harlow Aspenwood from East Yorkshire What a smile. She could lift a room with that wonderful smile and that genuine interest that she has in the people of this country."" Warwickshire County Council Leader, Izzi Seccombe I do remember her smile, I experienced that myself. It not only lit up a room, it lit up a nation - and she had the capacity to make us smile too."" Bishop of Coventry, Reverend Christopher Cocksworth Zara Umar gave flowers to the Queen in 2002 My daughter Zara and I went down to the City Square in Dundee to see the Queen in 2002. We waited for a long time. Soon the time came and the Queen was walking towards us. She was about five or six steps away from us when one of her security personnel guided the Queen away to the car to leave. Zara was so disappointed and my heart sank. Just then a plain clothes man came and asked me if he could lift Zara over the barrier. Much to my delight, Zara presented the flowers to the Queen and said 'here you are then, take your flowers.' I couldnt believe it! The Queen must have found it funny though and watched Zara return to me with a big smile on her face. I will treasure this memory forever."" Ishrat Umar, Dundee Three army veterans from Worcestershire pay tribute to the Queen... She was our head, she was our leader, she was the person we were serving and she's the one that we would follow. It hits you, it hits your heart."" Eric Braithwaite, who served for 23 years with the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers Everyone called her the boss in one way or another. I've actually guarded the Queen and Prince Philip on other duties. A big lump in the throat, lost the boss, getting a new one."" Dave Sandy, who served in the territorial army from the late 1970s until the 1990s I've done a lot of parades for the Queen, she was a lovely lady and worked so hard for the country. I was in tears, I will be honest. It was an honour to be with her and be a soldier for her."" Anthony Goodway, who spent two years in national service from 1958 until 1960 I met the Queen when she visited the Isle of Skye as part of her Golden Jubilee tour. As a nurse then at the local care home, myself and other staff members were invited to bring some of our residents to meet Her Majesty. The great day came, our ladies looking beautiful, wheelchairs polished. One of our residents had worked at the palace as a younger woman and had photos of the Queen all around her room in the care home, so, if any one was to be there that day, it was her.  As the Queen approached our little group that day she asked me: âAre these the ladies from the care home?' I replied in the positive and then said this resident had worked in the palace. The Queen looked down a little and asked her: âWhen did you work at the palace?â To which, the lady looked up and and replied, in a rather gruff voice: âAnd who are you?â What a moment. I apologised. The Queen just smiled and moved on.  I was quite overwhelmed, I donât have photos of the Queen all over the house, but Iâve always respected her, especially as a Christian woman. She had a real true faith, so meeting her was very special. I didnât expect to be so overcome by the moment. Her demeanour was that of interest and she handled the situation really well. She left us all feeling very special and honoured. Barbara Matheson from Glasgow Barbara Matheson has recalled the moment she met the Queen during Her Majesty's Golden Jubilee tour Â© 2025 BBC.

Parliament stirred by personal tributes to monarch,"This video can not be played Watch: Tears and laughter as MPs and peers pay tribute to Queen Elizabeth II Politicians from both Houses of Parliament have gathered to mark the death of Queen Elizabeth II and share their memories of the late monarch. Prime Minister Liz Truss described the Queen as one of the world's greatest-ever leaders, as she opened two days of special tributes in Parliament. MPs and ex-PMs paid their respects in personal speeches that aroused both tears and laughter in emotional scenes. A minute's silence was held to remember the Queen after 70 years on the throne. Both Houses of Parliament are sitting on Friday and Saturday to allow politicians to pay tribute to the Queen, following her death on Thursday. Follow the latest developments A life well lived - King pays tribute to his mother Former prime ministers reflect on Queen's reign Obituary: A long life marked by a sense of duty Friday's proceedings in Parliament paused at 18:00 BST for MPs and peers to watch the new king, Charles III, deliver a televised address to the nation, his first as monarch. Earlier, King Charles III was greeted by crowds singing ""God save the king"" outside Buckingham Palace, where he held his first in-person audience with Ms Truss. On Saturday, Ms Truss and senior ministers will attend the Accession Council at St James's Palace, where Charles will be formally proclaimed king. In Parliament on Friday, MPs and peers from all sides, dressed in dark clothing, paid tribute to the Queen by sharing memories of their own encounters with her. There have been many anecdotes about the Queen's wisdom, sense of humour and ability to put people at their ease. Some MPs laughed uproariously as former Prime Minister Theresa May recalled how mortified she was when the Queen caught her returning a dropped piece of cheese to a plate, as she helped prepare a picnic at Balmoral. ""I looked at her. She looked at me. And she just smiled. And the cheese remained on the table."" But the session began in solemn fashion, as Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle invited a packed Commons chamber to rise and observe a minute's silence. MPs stood for a minute's silence as they gathered for tributes to the Queen As the silence ended, Sir Lindsay described the Queen as a ""devoted monarch"" who had seen 57 complete sessions of Parliament during her reign in a brief speech. Ms Truss, who was appointed prime minister by the Queen just three days ago at Balmoral, paid tribute to her ""sheer humanity"", which she said had made her ""loved and admired"" all over the world. She said her reign had been ""dignified but not distant"" and credited her with re-inventing the British monarchy for the modern age. The Queen's successor, her eldest son King Charles III, now carried the ""awesome responsibility"" of the British crown, added the prime minister. ""The crown endures. Our nation endures. And in that spirit, I say God save the King."" Cheers of approval erupted from MPs, with some shouting ""God save the King"" from the side gallery in the moments after Ms Truss's speech concluded. This video can not be played Liz Truss: Queen 'one of the greatest leaders the world has known' Next to speak was the leader of the Opposition, Labour MP Sir Keir Starmer, who reflected on the tumultuous political events of recent times and the extraordinary national change heralded by the Queen's death. ""When everything is spinning, a nation requires a still point, when times are difficult, it requires comfort, and when direction is hard to find, it requires leadership,"" Sir Keir said. ""The loss of our Queen robs this country of its stillest point, its greatest comfort, at precisely the time we need those things most."" He said the Queen had enjoyed a ""personal relationship with us all"", based on ""total commitment"" to duty and a ""deep devotion to the country, the Commonwealth, and the people she loved"". This video can not be played Watch: Sir Keir Starmer pays tribute to the Queen Boris Johnson - who offered the Queen his resignation as prime minister at Balmoral on Tuesday - reflected on that meeting, saying the late monarch ""was as radiant and as knowledgeable and as fascinated by politics as ever I can remember"". Praising the late monarch as ""Elizabeth the Great"", he recalled her ""humility"" and, like other former leaders, spoke of informal gatherings with the Royal Family, at Balmoral. ""Unlike us politicians, with our outriders and our armour-plated convoys, I can tell you as a direct eyewitness that she drove herself in her own car with no detectives and no bodyguard, bouncing at alarming speed over the Scottish landscape to the total amazement of the ramblers and the tourists we encountered."" Mrs May described her weekly prime ministerial meetings with the Queen as ""a conversation with a woman of experience and knowledge and immense wisdom"". ""They were also the one meeting I went to, which I knew it would not be briefed out to the media,"" Mrs May said, to laughter from MPs. Harriet Harman, who is known as Mother of the House, told MPs about the Queen's kindness after she lost her senior government role in 1998. ""My diary was empty, and my phone stopped ringing. My office was astonished to get a call from Buckingham Palace. No one else wanted to have anything to do with me, but the Queen wanted to see me. ""I was invited to take tea with the Queen for her to thank me for my service as secretary of state."" This video can not be played Theresa May shares an amusing story about how down-to-earth the Queen was SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford used his speech to draw attention to the Queen's well-known affection for Scotland, where she spent her final days at Balmoral Castle. ""The relationship between Scotland and the Queen was one of shared admiration,"" Mr Blackford said. ""Indeed, whilst she was everyone's Queen, for many in Scotland, she was Elizabeth, Queen of Scots."" Former Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett said she was one of the few MPs to remember the Queen's coronation in 1953. The veteran Labour MP shared fond memories of the Queen's sense of fun, and choked back tears as she hailed ""a remarkable person, a remarkable monarch"". Meanwhile in the Lords, the newly appointed leader of Parliament's upper house, Lord True, led tributes to the Queen, calling her an ""anchor of stability in a changing world"". Ending his moving tribute, Lord True looked poignantly at the sovereign's throne, where the Queen had sat for numerous state openings of Parliament, and said: ""Thank you, Ma'am. May you ever rest in peace as you will ever rest in our hearts."" His words were followed by those of Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, who spoke of the Queen's ""profound sense of being called by God"" and her dry sense of humour. And former Labour cabinet minister Lord Blunkett recalled how the Queen came to his aid after he ended up facing the wrong way as he knelt during a royal audience. The blind peer said the Queen, in a ""careful and never patronising way"" managed to ""gently - by touching my arm - shift me round"". On Saturday evening, Parliament will be postponed until after 21 September, during a period of national mourning.

The moment palace crowds learned the news,"This video can not be played Crowds sing God save the Queen outside Buckingham Palace As the union jack at Buckingham Palace was lowered to half mast, the crowds outside stood still in shock. The silence was broken only by a symphony of news alerts on people's phones, and the messages that followed. The mood had shifted: it was inquisitive, then suddenly sombre. It was now official. The Queen had died. People had gathered throughout the afternoon after hearing she was ill. The gravity of the moment was all over 77-year-old Sheila De Bellaigue's teary face. ""I didn't realise until I saw the flag lower,"" she said, ""and then I knew. I'm feeling very sad, as is everybody who is here."" The Londoner remembers getting her coronation mug as a schoolgirl. ""She's been a wonderful queen, and she'll be very much missed."" Also watching the flag being lowered was Michael Hammond, 23, from Southampton. ""I thought she embodied the British spirit, she gave her entire life, and just united generations,"" he said. It was not long before a sea of people came through Green Park and over the road to the palace, forcing traffic to stop. Hayley Jarvis, from Wolverhampton, had been at Euston station waiting for a train when she saw the news on a departure board. She caught the tube straight to the palace to share in the national moment. ""I just wanted to come down just to show my respects,"" she says. ""It's terribly sad. I lost my own dad recently, so I've got a lot of empathy for how the family must be feeling."" Hayley Jarvis says the Queen's Speech was an annual tradition for her and her family There were hundreds of people outside the palace by the time she arrived. ""It's going to be a shockwave,"" she said, ""and there will be ripples for days and days."" The pavement outside the palace gates filled with young and old, Brits and tourists. Some stood alone, in silence, in the rain. Others gathered under umbrellas with their friends. Dave Baldwin was at the gym when the news alert pinged to his phone. He jumped on a bike and headed for the palace from Oxford Street, around a mile away. ""It's quite sombre isn't it - at the same time we kind of knew it was coming,"" he said. ""But it's nice to see people turn out and giving flowers. I'm sure it's just the start of people coming and showing their appreciation."" People forced their way through the crowds, by now dozens of people-deep, to lay flowers at the gates. Harry Wang came to lay flowers after learning about the Queen's death at home Looking visibly upset as he clutched a bouquet of gerberas and chrysanthemums was Harry Wang. ""I was at home when I heard the news,"" the 44-year-old air steward, from London, said. ""She was a symbol of this country, and of this nation."" Suzette Williams, who's 51 and from Norwich, was on the London Underground, on the way to the palace, when the announcement was made. ""I feel more sad than I was expecting,"" she said. ""I just thought this is the end of an era. The Queen has been here all my life.""

"This is the moment history stopsIt was the Queenâs life and work to be the best of Britain - this is the service she gave, writes the BBCâs Jonny Dymond.UK","This is the moment history stops; for a minute, an hour, for a day or a week; this is the moment history stops. Across a life and reign, two moments from two very different eras illuminate the thread that bound the many decades together. At each a chair, a desk, a microphone, a speech. In each, that high-pitched voice, those clipped precise vowels, that slight hesitation about public speaking that would never quite seem to leave her. One moment is sun-dappled, though the British people were suffering through a terrible post-war winter. A young woman, barely more than a girl really, sits straight-backed, her dark hair pulled up, two strings of pearls around her neck. Her youthful skin is flawless, she is very beautiful. A life opens out ahead of her. She pledges that life to her audience around the world. She tells them: ""I shall not have the strength to carry out this resolution alone."" And she asks for their company in the years to come. Two moments from two eras - the Queen makes a broadcast on her 21st birthday, top, and on the 75th anniversary of the end of the Second World War in Europe The other speech is more formal. More than seven decades later, on the 75th anniversary of the day the war in Europe ended, she sits behind a desk, a picture of her father, the late King, in uniform, to her right. Her hair - still pulled up - is white now. She wears a blue dress, two brooches, three strings of pearls. The many decades have left their mark, but her eyes still sparkle and her voice is still clear. The desk is practically empty but for the photo and to the right, in the foreground, a dark khaki cap, with a badge on its front. ""All had a part to play,"" she says of a long-ago war. The cap belonged to Second Subaltern Windsor, of the Auxiliary Territorial Service; the young Princess Elizabeth nagged her adoring father to allow her to join, so she could serve in uniform, even as the war that defined her - and for many decades her nation - drew to an end. Now, 75 years on, the cap has pride of place as she speaks to the nation on the anniversary of a great and heroic victory. Service to the UK military - inspecting Grenadier Guards in 1952, and RAF crews in 1957 The cap is a simple reminder of what she admired most - service: the service she offered that golden day decades beforehand, the service she saw in her formative years as nation, Commonwealth and Empire gave life and limb so that others could be free; the service that she believed lay at the heart of the Crown she inherited and devoted her long life to. Three decades on from that vow of service, she would allow herself a rare moment of public introspection; ""Although that vow was made 'in my salad days when I was green in judgement',"" she told the Guildhall on her Silver Jubilee, ""I do not regret or retract one word of it."" Over the decades she spoke little, and revealed even less, about herself in public. She - a child of the broadcast age - never gave an interview. Once or twice she would be filmed ""in conversation"" with a trusted friend, talking amicably about something uncontroversial, like the royal jewellery collection. Her words would be scoured for a hint of controversy or an opening into her character. But she was too careful - and her friends too loyal - for anything important to slip out. She did not neglect the medium that came of age as she did. It was her decision to allow her coronation to be televised, her decision to televise the Christmas Broadcast, her decision to speak live to the nation after the death of Diana, Princess of Wales. ""I have to be seen to be believed,"" she would say. Service to the nation - being crowned in 1953, and with then Prime Minister Edward Heath at a concert in 1973 Broadcast and newspaper coverage, the endless pictures of her in well-chosen gowns and dresses - these were part of what it was to be Queen, part of the job she had pledged her life to. Talking about her feelings publicly was not. And she came from a generation - and from a nation -  that did not feel the need to share its feelings. The nation would change. She would not. Here fate and character would collide. It was her fate to take the Crown as the country moved into far-reaching change. But the Queen was open about her liking for tradition, for the ways things had always been done, and her dislike of change. Her heart was in the countryside, and there, with horses and dogs and amongst those who loved animals as she did, was the reassurance of a place that changed incrementally, if at all. ""I find that one of the sad things,"" she would say in the late 1980s, is ""that people don't take on jobs for life, they try different things the whole time."" Monarch and monarchy fitted hand-in-glove; a sovereign who relished tradition leading an institution established upon it. A life-long love of the countryside - in Windsor Great Park with Prince Charles and Princess Anne in 1956, and with Prince Philip at a farm on the Balmoral Estate in Scotland in 1972 Beyond the palace gates, a whirlwind of change would transform Britain. She came to the throne at a tipping point in British history. Victorious in - but exhausted by - war, the country was no longer a global, military or economic power. The rise of trade unions, the collective provision of services and the creation of a universal welfare state signalled a sea-change in the organisation of state and economy. The stately withdrawal from Empire became a hurried exit. As her reign progressed, the old order - Church and aristocracy, the gradations of class and knowing your place - crumbled. Financial success and celebrity overtook accident of birth as a measure of societal achievement. Consumer goods - fridges, washing machines, televisions and vacuum cleaners - transformed homes and social lives. Women joined the workforce; old working-class communities were swept away with the slums that housed them; a society once cohesive and homogeneous became mobile, atomised and diverse, uprooted from old certainties and loyalties. There was some change at the Palace too, especially early in the reign - the end of the debutante ""season"" would mean the daughters of the ""best"" families would no longer be presented at court, fresh faces were seen among those invited to lunch and dinner, and television meant Britons could see their Queen and how she lived - first for the Christmas broadcast, then for a full-length documentary in the late 1960s. But this was change with a very small ""c""; as her seventh decade on the throne drew to a close, the rhythm of the monarchy remained one which would be recognisable from the first, one which her father or even her grandfather would be unsurprised by: Christmas and New year at Sandringham, Easter at Windsor, the long summer break in Balmoral, Trooping the Colour, Royal Ascot, the Investitures, the Changing of the Guard, Remembrance Sunday. Changing times - riding the London Underground in 1969, and preparing to deliver her televised Christmas message in 1967, the first to be delivered in colour When change pressed in all around, she resisted. Her fate was to inherit the crown as the country stood on the cusp of change, and to reign as change swirled around the palace. Her character dictated that she would not change with it, would not bend to fashion. That resistance, that deep appreciation - love, even -  of tradition, was her greatest strength, and led to perhaps her greatest test and gravest crisis, as her family unravelled. Family always came second to the Crown. When her first two children, Prince Charles and Princess Anne, were little more than toddlers, they were left behind - as she and her sister Princess Margaret had been left behind by their parents two decades earlier - as the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh went on a six-month world tour. She was not an unfeeling mother, but she was a remote one. The Crown and its responsibilities had come to her when she was just 25, and she took those responsibilities very seriously. Many decisions about the children were delegated to the duke. Three of her four children's marriages would end in divorce. She believed in marriage, it was part of her Christian faith and her understanding of what knitted society together. ""Divorce and separation,"" she once said, ""are responsible for some of the darkest evils in our society today."" No doubt that view, held by many in the late 1940s, mellowed as the years went by. But no parent relishes seeing their child's marriage fail. The Queen's self-proclaimed ""annus horribilis"" in 1992 saw the separation of the Duke and Duchess of York, the divorce of Princess Anne and Captain Mark Phillips and the separation of the Prince and Princess of Wales. ""A low point in her life,"" wrote one biographer, not because of what had led to the rare public admission of tough times, ""but because of the lack of gratitude, even derision, with which her 40 years of dedication appeared to have been crowned."" Her first decade had passed in a dazzle of adulation, at home and abroad. Vast crowds turned out for her on international tours. Back home, some proclaimed a new Elizabethan Age, although the Queen was clever enough to immediately disavow it. Family time and personal loss - with Prince Philip and their four children in 1972, and looking at fire damage to Windsor Castle in 1992 The 1960s saw a slow cooling off - the Queen was more involved with her family, the novelty of a new monarch had passed, the generation of the post-war baby boom now coming of age was gripped by different passions than their parents. The 1970s and 80s saw no let-up in her service, but the focus of some Royalty enthusiasts - and the media - shifted to her children, their marriages and their partners. By the mid-90s, the monarchy seemed to some to be out of touch with the popular mood; in the newspaper comment columns there was direct criticism of the Queen, and contemplation of the monarchy's future. Her reign at times seemed associated with another epoch. What was her place - and the monarchy's - in the new ""Cool Britannia"" and the informal style embraced by Tony Blair? How did the Palace - repository of tradition - fit in with the popular demand for change expressed in Labour's crushing election victory? Just months after that victory, one hot August night in Paris, came the death of Diana, Princess of Wales. A broiling carpet of flowers soon stretched out in front of Kensington Palace. The flag-pole above Buckingham Palace remained bare. Many in the nation found themselves desolate at the loss of the Princess. ""Show us you care, Ma'am"" bayed the Daily Express headline. ""Where is our Queen? Where is her flag?"" demanded the Sun. For five long days, the Queen remained in Balmoral, seemingly unaware of the spasm sweeping parts of the country. Perhaps, as the Palace would brief afterwards, it was to protect and console the young Princes William and Harry. But given her character, that deep dislike of change appears to have driven the decisions taken at the time; Balmoral was not to be interrupted, no flag ever flew from Buckingham Palace in her absence, the Royal Standard never flew at half-mast. It was a terrible misjudgement. She hurried back to the capital, back to Buckingham Palace. She stopped to look at the flowers piling up all around. ""We were not confident,"" one former official told a biographer, ""that when the Queen got out of the car, she would not be hissed and jeered."" It was that bad. Joy and tragedy - the Queen with Prince Charles and his then-fiancÃ©e Lady Diana Spencer in 1981, and with Prince Philip among the floral tributes following the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, in 1997 She had refused to broadcast at first, then yielded, then agreed to speak live. She spoke to the nation, just before the BBC Six O'clock news. She - who had once driven broadcast executives to despair with her wooden delivery - barely had time to prepare. Her performance was flawless, her speech brief but perfectly pitched. She spoke of ""lessons to be learned""; she spoke ""as a grandmother""; she spoke of the ""determination to cherish"" Diana's memory. It was a triumph, pulled from the jaws of deep crisis. The poison swirling around the Royal Family, around the Palace and around the very institution of the monarchy, was drawn. Once in her reign - just once - fate and character had collided with near-disastrous consequences. They would combine more happily in the Queen's international role. By the time of her death, she had not toured for many years. But for decades she was not only a global celebrity like no other, but also a subtle instrument of influence. Nothing would compare to the first dazzling decade of her reign, before television made her image commonplace and her tours accessible from the living room. On her long 1954 tour of Australia, two-thirds of the country is thought to have turned out to see her; in 1961 two million people lined the road from the airport to the Indian capital Delhi; in Calcutta three-and-half million would stand and wait to see the daughter of the last Emperor. Fate would dictate that she would oversee the long twilight of Empire, though not once did the Queen attend a flag-lowering ceremony. Many times in the 1950s and 60s, a member of the Royal Family would stand as the Union flag came down over a former colony, the national anthem playing one last time. A determination that something should emerge from the imperial family which she had pledged to serve, would mean that she would build a new association on the ashes of Britain's imperial legacy. In palaces and houses dotted across the capital and the country, lived her blood family. Across the world was spread her territorial family - a group of wildly diverse nations, vast and tiny, rich and impoverished, republics and monarchies - that she charmed and cajoled and nudged to remember what bound them together, and what together they might achieve. International tours were taken on behalf of the government of the day; they were tools of foreign policy - if not explicitly, then on the understanding that the Queen's influence would be beneficial to the relationships between Britain and the places she visited. It looked glamorous - the Royal Yacht, the Queen's Flight, banquets and galas - and before international air travel became commonplace, it was an extraordinary experience. But it was always hard work, long days and weeks of receptions, exhibitions, openings, lunches with officials, state dinners and speeches given and listened to patiently. Those who have observed a royal tour find it hard to imagine it is any fun for those at the heart of it. A global role - with Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie in at the waterfall where the Nile begins, in 1965, and greeted coming off the royal yacht Britannia by the Emir of Bahrain in 1979 She would rarely take a holiday outside the UK - travelling abroad meant work. Her foreign travel would mark the step-changes in Britain's relationship with the places she visited: post-war Germany in 1965; a liberalising China in 1986; Russia in 1994, once the regime that had murdered her relatives had been swept away. A trip to post-apartheid South Africa in 1995 she would call: ""One of the most outstanding experiences of my life"". President Nelson Mandela replied: ""One of the most unforgettable moments in our history."" And no visit marked and sealed a changed relationship more than her trip to Ireland in 2011. Not for a century had a British monarch been to the south. When her grandfather had visited in 1911 the island of Ireland was one, part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. Violent revolt, partition and independence would follow. After World War Two came acts of violence against the existence of the partition border and then, for 30 terrible years, a brutal terrorist campaign in Northern Ireland and Britain against British rule, with harsh acts of repression by the British government which polarised opinion in the Republic. There was never a right time for a royal visit, because of the distrust across the narrow stretch of water which separates Britain and Ireland. With the signing of the Good Friday Agreement and the establishment of a power-sharing assembly, came the end of Ireland's constitutional claim to the six counties that make up Northern Ireland. On her state visit, extended by the Queen's wish, there was no escaping history. In the Garden of Remembrance, in the centre of Georgian Dublin, where all who fought for Ireland's independence are remembered and honoured, she laid a wreath and, unscripted and spontaneous, bowed her head to the men and women who had fought against British rule, an electrifying moment. At dinner she would open her speech in the Irish language, winning nearly every Irish heart. In that speech she spoke the language, if not the words, of apology; ""With the benefit of historical hindsight, we can all see things which we wish had been done differently, or not at all."" Before the Ireland state visit one biographer would write that ""it was difficult to point to major achievements"" in her reign. That judgement would not hold afterwards. The four days of pitch-perfect words and actions helped sweep away centuries of ill-will and distrust. Perhaps no greater single service did the Queen give her Crown, or her country. Ireland had haunted so many of her prime ministers. Her first, Winston Churchill, had spoken of the ""dreary steeples of Fermanagh and Tyrone"" rising again after World War One to bedevil British politics. One of her last, Boris Johnson, would grapple with the implications of the border within the island, and how to square that with the UK's departure from the European Union. All had the benefit of her ear, her experience, her perspective on British and world history. Her job in the weekly audiences she shared with the prime minister of the day was not to lobby for any individual cause, or to try to sway a government one way or another. She was there to advise, to encourage and to warn. And she was there to listen. All her prime ministers could be entirely confident that nothing they told her would escape. So she was the one person to whom they could freely talk who truly understood the machinery of state. For so many prime ministers, so often embattled, this was also a relief, an escape from watching their back and holding their tongue when around colleagues and rivals. ""They unburden themselves to me or tell me what's going on,"" she would say mid-reign. ""If they've got any problems, sometimes one can help in that way too. I think it'sâ¦as if one's sort of a sponge."" Here she was too self-deprecating. Almost nothing broke the confessional silence around those audiences, apart from praise for the extraordinary effort the Queen put into her work. The red boxes containing state papers - in Whitehall she was known as Reader No. 1 - went everywhere with her, to Balmoral, on tour, on the royal train, even winched aboard the Royal Yacht. For three hours a day, her private secretary estimated in the early 1970s, she read Foreign Office telegrams, reports of parliamentary proceedings, ministerial memoranda and cabinet minutes. And she remembered what she read, sometimes catching her prime ministers out with her grasp and her recall. ""I was astonished,"" wrote Harold Macmillan ""at Her Majesty's grasp of all the details sent in messages and telegrams."" Politically neutral, diplomatically useful - alongside former and current prime ministers in 1985, and with then US President Ronald Reagan in 1983 The Crown's political role had dwindled to almost nothing by the time she came to the throne. Two areas of discretion - where she as monarch had a say - survived: who to call to become prime minister and form a government, and when Parliament could be dissolved. Early in her reign, before the Conservatives started electing their leaders, she exercised her judgement, amid some controversy, as to who she would call to form a government when a Conservative prime minister resigned between general elections. But once the Conservatives started electing their leaders, that judgement was no longer called for. And over the decades, the very idea of the Palace becoming involved in such a decision became alien to British politics. The talk around closely fought elections was of ""protecting"" the Palace from having to make political decisions over who to call to form a government if there were no decisive winner. The Queen never had reason to deny a dissolution of Parliament, and it would have been an extraordinary act to do so. She well understood the tightly circumscribed role she had inherited. And the Crown's political voice was almost silent too. Much - too much, really - has been read into what one biographer calls the ""truism"" that she got on better with Labour leaders than their Conservative counterparts. For all the social difficulties there may have been with Margaret Thatcher, the Queen would attend her funeral, an honour bestowed on a prime minister only once before - Winston Churchill. Her personal political belief may well have leaned towards the centre; she came of age at the creation of that peacetime monument to wartime struggle, the National Health Service, and as the state extended its responsibilities for citizens' welfare and education. The strife of the early 1980s - rocketing unemployment, riots in the great cities, budget cuts and the miners' strike setting communities against each other - marked the end of one vision of Britain. An over-enthusiastic briefing by a Palace press officer to the Sunday Times in 1986 suggested unhappiness with the direction of government policy and what he said the Queen saw as the corrosion of the post-war political consensus. It was a brief glimpse into the thinking of a sovereign who believed that one of her roles was to unify an increasingly divided and disparate nation. And twice she stepped - very gingerly - into the debate over Scottish independence, once in a speech in the 1970s and once just before the referendum of 2014. Was this too political? To some nationalists, yes. But it was hardly surprising that she would urge a little caution on those preparing to decide on the break-up of her kingdom. Did her conservative character drive the way she carried out her political role? Perhaps, to some degree. But the last monarch to involve himself in political matters was her grandfather George V. By the time she took the throne, the political role had fallen away. Her institutional fate was to be a cipher, someone who did the bidding of others. That she would have understood from the start. Here, fate and character walked hand in hand. It was this avoidance of any political controversy as head of state, and her refusal to bend the monarchy to the winds of fashion, that enabled her to triumph in the role that would earn her the love and respect of so many, as head of nation. This is the great unwritten role of modern monarchy. This is where, unprotected by tradition and unprepared by precedent, character alone drove her reign. Formal and informal - in a carriage on her way to the state opening of Parliament in 2002, and laughing with Prince Philip in 2014 Her grandfather laid the foundations for a monarchy that served rather than ruled the nation, but spent much of his time blasting birds from the skies. Her father's reign was decided for him by fate: he was thrust into a role he did not expect and wore military uniform for much of his time as King. After catastrophe and criticism in the 1990s, the monarchy's fortunes rose again. As disillusionment followed the high hopes for political change, as cynicism became entrenched and political leaders derided, an uncontroversial and never-too-fashionable Queen became a figure of incorruptible continuity to a nation buffeted by change, disappointment and division. This was the nation's reward for her endless patience, for her refusal to emote in public, to share her thoughts, to lean left or right, to involve herself in fashionable causes or respond to the slings and arrows hurled at her and her family over the many decades. She remained apart from all that not because of hierarchy but because she - with a prescience that still rather astonishes - never engaged in the superficial of the day-to-day, the back and forth of modern life. She understood that the rhythm of monarchy - the traditions and ceremonies, the births and the weddings and the deaths - provided a comfort to those sometimes bewildered by the uprooting of the past, and served as a reminder that the drumbeat of life was shared across class, age and circumstance. And she understood that not everything in national life had to have an explicit purpose, that for a conservative nation in the throes of near-ceaseless change, the continuity she represented in person and in office had a value beyond measure. She, who with intuition beyond her years, pledged a life of service so many decades ago, made the monarchy the repository of much that the nation loved of itself. She could do that because her character reflected much of what Britons like to think of as the best of themselves; modest, uncomplaining, thrifty, intelligent if not intellectual, sensible, feet-on-the-ground, unfussy, a dry sense of humour with a great big laugh, slow to anger and always well-mannered. ""I am the last bastion of standards,"" she once said.  She was not boasting of better manners or finer etiquette than others. She was explaining her role and her life. It was her life and her work to be the best of Britain. This was the service she gave. Picture credits: Alamy, Getty Images, National Portrait Gallery and Jersey Heritage Trust. Â© 2025 BBC.

PM Liz Truss opens tributes to Queen in Parliament,"This video can not be played Watch: Tears and laughter as MPs and peers pay tribute to Queen Elizabeth II Politicians from both Houses of Parliament have gathered to mark the death of Queen Elizabeth II and share their memories of the late monarch. Prime Minister Liz Truss described the Queen as one of the world's greatest-ever leaders, as she opened two days of special tributes in Parliament. MPs and ex-PMs paid their respects in personal speeches that aroused both tears and laughter in emotional scenes. A minute's silence was held to remember the Queen after 70 years on the throne. Both Houses of Parliament are sitting on Friday and Saturday to allow politicians to pay tribute to the Queen, following her death on Thursday. Follow the latest developments A life well lived - King pays tribute to his mother Former prime ministers reflect on Queen's reign Obituary: A long life marked by a sense of duty Friday's proceedings in Parliament paused at 18:00 BST for MPs and peers to watch the new king, Charles III, deliver a televised address to the nation, his first as monarch. Earlier, King Charles III was greeted by crowds singing ""God save the king"" outside Buckingham Palace, where he held his first in-person audience with Ms Truss. On Saturday, Ms Truss and senior ministers will attend the Accession Council at St James's Palace, where Charles will be formally proclaimed king. In Parliament on Friday, MPs and peers from all sides, dressed in dark clothing, paid tribute to the Queen by sharing memories of their own encounters with her. There have been many anecdotes about the Queen's wisdom, sense of humour and ability to put people at their ease. Some MPs laughed uproariously as former Prime Minister Theresa May recalled how mortified she was when the Queen caught her returning a dropped piece of cheese to a plate, as she helped prepare a picnic at Balmoral. ""I looked at her. She looked at me. And she just smiled. And the cheese remained on the table."" But the session began in solemn fashion, as Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle invited a packed Commons chamber to rise and observe a minute's silence. MPs stood for a minute's silence as they gathered for tributes to the Queen As the silence ended, Sir Lindsay described the Queen as a ""devoted monarch"" who had seen 57 complete sessions of Parliament during her reign in a brief speech. Ms Truss, who was appointed prime minister by the Queen just three days ago at Balmoral, paid tribute to her ""sheer humanity"", which she said had made her ""loved and admired"" all over the world. She said her reign had been ""dignified but not distant"" and credited her with re-inventing the British monarchy for the modern age. The Queen's successor, her eldest son King Charles III, now carried the ""awesome responsibility"" of the British crown, added the prime minister. ""The crown endures. Our nation endures. And in that spirit, I say God save the King."" Cheers of approval erupted from MPs, with some shouting ""God save the King"" from the side gallery in the moments after Ms Truss's speech concluded. This video can not be played Liz Truss: Queen 'one of the greatest leaders the world has known' Next to speak was the leader of the Opposition, Labour MP Sir Keir Starmer, who reflected on the tumultuous political events of recent times and the extraordinary national change heralded by the Queen's death. ""When everything is spinning, a nation requires a still point, when times are difficult, it requires comfort, and when direction is hard to find, it requires leadership,"" Sir Keir said. ""The loss of our Queen robs this country of its stillest point, its greatest comfort, at precisely the time we need those things most."" He said the Queen had enjoyed a ""personal relationship with us all"", based on ""total commitment"" to duty and a ""deep devotion to the country, the Commonwealth, and the people she loved"". This video can not be played Watch: Sir Keir Starmer pays tribute to the Queen Boris Johnson - who offered the Queen his resignation as prime minister at Balmoral on Tuesday - reflected on that meeting, saying the late monarch ""was as radiant and as knowledgeable and as fascinated by politics as ever I can remember"". Praising the late monarch as ""Elizabeth the Great"", he recalled her ""humility"" and, like other former leaders, spoke of informal gatherings with the Royal Family, at Balmoral. ""Unlike us politicians, with our outriders and our armour-plated convoys, I can tell you as a direct eyewitness that she drove herself in her own car with no detectives and no bodyguard, bouncing at alarming speed over the Scottish landscape to the total amazement of the ramblers and the tourists we encountered."" Mrs May described her weekly prime ministerial meetings with the Queen as ""a conversation with a woman of experience and knowledge and immense wisdom"". ""They were also the one meeting I went to, which I knew it would not be briefed out to the media,"" Mrs May said, to laughter from MPs. Harriet Harman, who is known as Mother of the House, told MPs about the Queen's kindness after she lost her senior government role in 1998. ""My diary was empty, and my phone stopped ringing. My office was astonished to get a call from Buckingham Palace. No one else wanted to have anything to do with me, but the Queen wanted to see me. ""I was invited to take tea with the Queen for her to thank me for my service as secretary of state."" This video can not be played Theresa May shares an amusing story about how down-to-earth the Queen was SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford used his speech to draw attention to the Queen's well-known affection for Scotland, where she spent her final days at Balmoral Castle. ""The relationship between Scotland and the Queen was one of shared admiration,"" Mr Blackford said. ""Indeed, whilst she was everyone's Queen, for many in Scotland, she was Elizabeth, Queen of Scots."" Former Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett said she was one of the few MPs to remember the Queen's coronation in 1953. The veteran Labour MP shared fond memories of the Queen's sense of fun, and choked back tears as she hailed ""a remarkable person, a remarkable monarch"". Meanwhile in the Lords, the newly appointed leader of Parliament's upper house, Lord True, led tributes to the Queen, calling her an ""anchor of stability in a changing world"". Ending his moving tribute, Lord True looked poignantly at the sovereign's throne, where the Queen had sat for numerous state openings of Parliament, and said: ""Thank you, Ma'am. May you ever rest in peace as you will ever rest in our hearts."" His words were followed by those of Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, who spoke of the Queen's ""profound sense of being called by God"" and her dry sense of humour. And former Labour cabinet minister Lord Blunkett recalled how the Queen came to his aid after he ended up facing the wrong way as he knelt during a royal audience. The blind peer said the Queen, in a ""careful and never patronising way"" managed to ""gently - by touching my arm - shift me round"". On Saturday evening, Parliament will be postponed until after 21 September, during a period of national mourning.

Queen Elizabeth with the Duke of Edinburgh at a lodge in Kenya In January 1952, Princess Elizabeth and her husband the Duke of Edinburgh set off on an overseas tour in place of the monarch, who was terminally ill with lung cancer. Against medical advice, the King went to the airport to see the couple off. It was to be the last time Elizabeth, then just 25 years old, would see her father. She heard the news of his death while staying at a game lodge in Kenya and immediately returned to London as the Queen. She later recalled: ""In a way, I didn't have an apprenticeship. My father died much too young, so it was all a very sudden kind of taking on and making the best job you can.â Queen Elizabeth II returns to England Welsh politicians will be recalled to the Senedd - the Welsh
Parliament - on Sunday to pay tribute to Queen Elizabeth II. The session, in Cardiff Bay, will take place at 14:00 BST and

""One of the reasons we got them was because the Queen had them,"" she said, pushing a pram with two corgis patiently sitting inside. The Queen was known for her love of corgis dating back to when she was a child, and kept dozens of them over the course of her 70-year reign. Read more abouthow the Queen's love of corgis started a global phenomenon On Saturday, Windsor Castle became the site of a rare joint appearance by the new Prince of Wales, William, with his brother Prince Harry, and their wives. It is a building that had deep significance to the monarch throughout her life - a place of work but also her own private retreat. The Queen's special association with Windsor Castle began when she was a child. 
The then-Princess Elizabeth and her family made Royal Lodge - a mansion in the grounds of the Windsor Estate - their weekend country home. The first instinct of many mourning the death of Queen Elizabeth II has been to leave flowers at Windsor Castle.  At the age of 14, the then-princess and her sister Margaret were sent to the castle for much of World War Two while their home in London faced the threat of being bombed. The castle has been inhabited continuously by 40 monarchs across almost 1,000 years. With 1,000 rooms, 13 acres (five hectares) of grounds and reminders of its rich history amid the gothic architecture, it is little wonder the Queen saw the castle as a sanctuary.

From world leaders to members of the public, people reflected on Her Majesty's legacy. Tributes for the Queen have poured in from statesmen around the world, and on Saturday, the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken was the latest to issue his  condolences. On Twitter, Blinken posted a photo from the US embassy in Washington, thanking the Queen for her ""steadfast leadership"" and ""unwavering commitment to service"". Dame Karen Pierce, the UK ambassador to the US, thanked Blinken for the message, calling the Queen ""our foremost diplomat"" and ""active supporter"" of the two countries' ""special relationship"" - a phrase that had been coined by her first prime minister, Churchill.

Katty KayUS special correspondent Queen Elizabeth and Ronald Reagan ride horses in Windsor Home Park in 1982 US presidents wield hard power. They control the
biggest military in the world and its richest country. Yet,
one after one, they would walk into Buckingham Palace and go jelly-kneed. This
diminutive woman reduced powerful presidents to grinning school boys. She traded scone recipes with Dwight Eisenhower, danced
with Gerald Ford and rode with Ronald Reagan. Somehow she managed to find a way to
connect with each of them, not just as a fellow head of state, but as a person. The one president who, according to someone who worked
for him, didn't go into his first meeting with the Queen already star struck
was Barack Obama. Apparently he rather resisted the ""hype,"" as
this staffer put it. But then he met her. And, like the 11 presidents
before him, he, too, was won over. Indeed, the two developed such a good
relationship that the Queen reportedly asked him to come and visit even after
he left office. I'm told that what changed the 44th president's view was her
sense of responsibility and duty - she was, in Obama language, a no-drama
Queen. US presidents often have a keen sense of history and all those years on the throne wasn't lost on them. As a long day draws to a close in the UK, let's look back at what happened today: Charles III was proclaimed kingby the Accession Council in a ceremony at St James's Palace in London.Read more here. In Balmoral, three of the Queen's children -Princess Anne, Prince Andrew and Prince Edward -attended a church service along with other members of the royal family, and stopped to greet well-wishers outside the gates of Balmoral. Details of the Queen's funeral were announced- it will take place at 11am on Monday, 19 September at Westminster Abbey.Get more details here.

Princes Harry and William, joined by their wives,delighted crowds as they went for a walkabout in Windsor, collecting floral tributes and meeting some of those who turned out to pay their respects.Watch the moment here. The Queen was a big part of the community in the village near Balmoral, says the church minister Balmoral, the Scottish castle where the Queen died, was the place where she ""enjoyed being normal"", according to royal historian Robert Lacey, So it's no surprise thatpeople in the nearby village of Ballater remember her with special affection. ""She was not just our Queen, she was a neighbour - and a big part of this community,"" says Rev David Barr at Glenmuick Church in the village. Alistair Cassie, who runs a hardware shop in Ballater and has a royal warrant for supplying Balmoral with its televisions, remembered being called to the castle to fix interference with the radio. The Royal Banner of Scotland flies at half-mast at Balmoral Castle ""I was walking along this corridor, and who did I meet but the Queen,"" he says. They chatted about her appreciation for the BBC Radio 2 presenter Jimmy Young. The sprawling Balmoral Estate includes dozens of houses, many occupied by estate staff, and Cassie says at times the Queen would appear unannounced at someone's home, asking: ""How are you doing?"" Grant Harrold, a former butler to King Charles when he was Prince of Wales, says the Queen and Prince Philip would sometimes stay at a small cottage on the estate. He says: ""From what I was told - I never witnessed it - she would be in the kitchen cooking away and he would lay the table, so it was very much a chance for them to be a normal couple."" Alistair Cassie met the Queen on a formal visit - and unexpectedly in the corridor of the castle Crowds continued to form at Buckingham Palace on Saturday night as people paid tribute to the Queen Many took photos at the gates, where flowers have been left in memory of the monarch Six-year-old Penelope is among the people to have left tributes for the Queen near the palace As the nation continues to mourn the death of Queen Elizabeth II, here's what we know about the plans for tomorrow:  Sean CoughlanBBC News, royal correspondent Headline writers will be thinking about ""Brothers in arms"" or maybe ""Brothers in grief"" for their coverage. The sight of Princes William and Harry meeting the crowds together will become one of the stand-out and most unexpected images from what have been sombre days. With their wives, Catherine and Meghan, they greeted people in Windsor, in a way that couldn't have been predicted last week, when the Sussexes returned to the UK. The talk then was of feuds and unbridgeable differences between couples. They were said to be staying in houses close together on the Windsor estate, while emotionally many miles apart. The couple hadn't been seen together in public for more than two years. That all changed on Thursday. If William and Harry were not planning to see each other, they were brought together in ways that couldn't have been predicted.

     son walked slowly up to Rideau Hall, the residency of the Governor
     General, Mary Simon - she is the representative of the monarch in Canada

     commonwealth realms in addition to the UK. A realm is a country whose
     monarch is the King. Canada is one of the realms and today, like in the
     UK, there was an official proclamation of the King. Trumpets sounded, the

     the King of Canada. Firstly in English and then in French, with Trudeau at
     his side, Samy Khalid, proclaimed His Royal Highness Prince Charles III,

     gathered.  Tributes for Queen Elizabeth II are continuing to pour in from around the world. Oliver Atkin from Bromley says he remembers meeting the monarch on the Balmoral estate in 2012 while on a family day out. She ""walked straight up to us and said hello.

Simon Coveney said many Irish people saw her with ""new affection"" after she became thefirst UK monarch to visit the independent statein May 2011. Across Northern Ireland, people have been laying flowers and signing books of condolence for the late Queen. A number ofsports events have been postponedas a mark of respect.

This video can not be played Those laying flowers at Hillsborough Castle spoke of their admiration for the Queen In particular, they have praised her contribution to the peace process on the island of Ireland, remembering her first and only visit to the Republic of Ireland 11 years ago. She was hosted by Belfast native Mary McAleese, the then president of Ireland. Mrs McAleese described the four-day trip as ""magical"" and said the Queen had made a ""very special pilgrimage of reconciliation"". During the visit, the Queen laid a wreath in Dublin's Garden of Remembrance - a park dedicated to Irish people who fought against British rule. She also spoke a few words in Irish at a state dinner in Dublin Castle, the former seat of British power in Ireland. A moment of reflection during the Queen's visit to Ireland in May 2011 Speaking to the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme, Mrs McAleese said the Queen was a person who transcended politics and who was ""deeply respected"" by people from different backgrounds and political persuasions. ""Many, many people across the island who would not be supporters of the idea of monarchy, for example people who would be republicans, and many Irish nationalists would share with me deep sorrow at her passing, because she was always a woman who was worthy of respect,"" the former president said. ""Why? Because she earned that respect over seven decades."" The 2011 visit was ""an extraordinary moment"" in British-Irish relations, according to the Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs, Simon Coveney. At the time, Mr Coveney escorted the Queen on a walkabout around the English Market in his native Cork. The Queen visited the English Market in Cork in 2011, accompanied by Simon Coveney (right) He told the BBC's Talkback's programme the royal guest ""managed to charm an entire country"" during her trip. ""And she addressed the British-Irish relationship in terms of our history - with all its tragedy, but with all it's closeness - in a way that really I think resulted in so many Irish people seeing her with a new affection. ""It was just one of her many achievements over 70 years of an extraordinary reign."" The following year, the Queen broke new ground in herfirst meeting with the then deputy first minister, and former IRA commander, Martin McGuinness. Speaking to Evening Extra, the former first minister Peter Robinson recalled his memories of the historic handshake. ""I felt that she very strongly wanted to make a contribution. She felt we were on the right path, that the kind of reconciliation and way forward that we were moving was something that was worthy of her support,"" he said. ""She showed that by her own endeavours in Northern Ireland as well as her visit to the south. This video can not be played Former First Minister Peter Robinson speaks to BBC Radio Ulster's Evening Extra about his memories of the Queen ""It wasn't an easy occasion for either of the two individuals because there was a lot of history on both sides. I think it was an important part of our overall process."" Mr Robinson said Mr McGuinness ""did take some flak"" from some people around him over the occasions he met the Queen. ""It wasn't always an easy thing for republicans to do but I think it did just indicate that we were moving on in Northern Ireland,"" he added.

Tributes paid from all political quarters,"Tributes have been paid across Northern Ireland and the Republic to Queen Elizabeth II, the UK's longest-serving monarch, following her death. Politicians and church leaders have sent their condolences to the Royal family. ""This is just the saddest news and our hearts are breaking. ""Her Majesty The Queen was a wonderful lady and I had the privilege of meeting her many times including here at Hillsborough Castle. ""People right across Northern Ireland tonight will be deeply sorrowful for the loss of this marvellous, wonderful Queen. ""There is no doubt Her Majesty The Queen played a very important role in helping to build reconciliation. Her visit to Dublin was a cathartic moment in the history of British-Irish relations."" ""I wish to extend deepest sympathy to the British Royal Family on the death of Queen Elizabeth II. ""Her passing marks the end of an era. ""Relationships between our two countries, for so long marked by conflict and suffering, have been recast and reimagined through the Good Friday Agreement. ""The Queen proved a powerful advocate and ally of those who believe in peace and reconciliation. ""I salute her contribution to the huge change that has evolved in recent years."" ""The Queen's passing is indeed the end of an era. Her state visit to Ireland in 2011 marked a crucial step in the normalisation of relations with our nearest neighbour. ""That visit was a great success, largely because of the many gracious gestures and warm remarks made by the Queen during her time in Ireland. ""Her popularity with the Irish people was also very evident and clearly made a very positive impact on the Queen. In particular, I recall the warmth of the welcome she received from the public in Cork during her walkabout at the English Market.

""On behalf of the people of Ireland, may I express my heartfelt sympathy to His Majesty King Charles and to the Royal Family on their very great personal loss. ""May I offer my deepest condolences to the British people and to the members of the Commonwealth on the loss of a unique, committed and deeply respected Head of State. ""Her Majesty served the British people with exceptional dignity. ""Her personal commitment to her role and extraordinary sense of duty were the hallmarks of her period as Queen, which will hold a unique place in British history."" ""I am deeply saddened at the news of the loss of Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth II. ""Throughout her reign, Her Majesty has been the matriarch and pillar of our country and the Commonwealth. ""She has always provided wise counsel, admirably and selflessly, fulfilling a lifetime commitment to public service. ""Her Majesty dedicated herself to our family of nations - no more so was this apparent than in Northern Ireland. ""We will always be greatly indebted for her efforts to promote reconciliation and the fostering of better community relations, ensuring peace and stability.""

""All deaths are inevitable, but few are as unimaginable as that of Queen Elizabeth II. ""For all who met her, it was clear that she was interested in people from all backgrounds and that she respected them. ""In the privacy of their meetings she also shared the riches of her incomparable experience of public affairs with 15 prime ministers. ""Her many visits to Northern Ireland were evidence of her awareness that she had been crowned Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and her conscientiousness in living out that role."" ""For those in Northern Ireland who express their loyalty to the Crown, few can remember a time when The Queen was not part of the very fabric of national life, as her Platinum Jubilee in June demonstrated. ""At the same time, for many who do not share that same sense of loyalty, in her long life Queen Elizabeth became one of the most recognisable and respected figures across these islands.

Simon Coveney said many Irish people saw her with ""new affection"" after she became thefirst UK monarch to visit the independent statein May 2011. Across Northern Ireland, people have been laying flowers and signing books of condolence for the late Queen. A number ofsports events have been postponedas a mark of respect. The UK is in mourning after its longest-reigning monarch died on Thursday afternoon at Balmoral Castle in Scotland. The Northern Ireland Assembly will be recalled on Monday at 12:30 BST to allow members to pay tribute. Politicians and dignitaries from across the island of Ireland have expressed their admirationfor the Queen's 70 years of service as Britain's head of state. This video can not be played Those laying flowers at Hillsborough Castle spoke of their admiration for the Queen In particular, they have praised her contribution to the peace process on the island of Ireland, remembering her first and only visit to the Republic of Ireland 11 years ago. She was hosted by Belfast native Mary McAleese, the then president of Ireland. Mrs McAleese described the four-day trip as ""magical"" and said the Queen had made a ""very special pilgrimage of reconciliation"". During the visit, the Queen laid a wreath in Dublin's Garden of Remembrance - a park dedicated to Irish people who fought against British rule. She also spoke a few words in Irish at a state dinner in Dublin Castle, the former seat of British power in Ireland. A moment of reflection during the Queen's visit to Ireland in May 2011 Speaking to the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme, Mrs McAleese said the Queen was a person who transcended politics and who was ""deeply respected"" by people from different backgrounds and political persuasions. ""Many, many people across the island who would not be supporters of the idea of monarchy, for example people who would be republicans, and many Irish nationalists would share with me deep sorrow at her passing, because she was always a woman who was worthy of respect,"" the former president said. ""Why? Because she earned that respect over seven decades."" The 2011 visit was ""an extraordinary moment"" in British-Irish relations, according to the Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs, Simon Coveney. At the time, Mr Coveney escorted the Queen on a walkabout around the English Market in his native Cork. The Queen visited the English Market in Cork in 2011, accompanied by Simon Coveney (right) He told the BBC's Talkback's programme the royal guest ""managed to charm an entire country"" during her trip. ""And she addressed the British-Irish relationship in terms of our history - with all its tragedy, but with all it's closeness - in a way that really I think resulted in so many Irish people seeing her with a new affection. ""It was just one of her many achievements over 70 years of an extraordinary reign."" The following year, the Queen broke new ground in herfirst meeting with the then deputy first minister, and former IRA commander, Martin McGuinness. Speaking to Evening Extra, the former first minister Peter Robinson recalled his memories of the historic handshake. ""I felt that she very strongly wanted to make a contribution. She felt we were on the right path, that the kind of reconciliation and way forward that we were moving was something that was worthy of her support,"" he said. ""She showed that by her own endeavours in Northern Ireland as well as her visit to the south. This video can not be played Former First Minister Peter Robinson speaks to BBC Radio Ulster's Evening Extra about his memories of the Queen ""It wasn't an easy occasion for either of the two individuals because there was a lot of history on both sides. I think it was an important part of our overall process."" Mr Robinson said Mr McGuinness ""did take some flak"" from some people around him over the occasions he met the Queen. ""It wasn't always an easy thing for republicans to do but I think it did just indicate that we were moving on in Northern Ireland,"" he added.

""She was a very lovely woman and I was very privileged to have met her on three or four occasions,"" he said. ""And one of the amazing things about her was that when you met her, without the cameras and all of that around, she was a very ordinary woman. ""I always used to say she reminds me of my mother. She was just the same sort of person - very informed. ""She had a wicked sense of humour - I mean a really, really wicked sense of humour which, away from the cameras, appeared the whole time. ""She was just a lovely person to talk to. ""She was part of Hillsborough. And presumably her son will continue to be part of Hillsborough."" Stephen Gilmore: ""One day you've a new prime minister, the next a new monarch"" Speaking at the castle gates, as people laid tributes while a light drizzle fell, Stephen Gilmore told BBC News NI he was ""very shocked"" by the Queen's death ""because we saw her on the TV yesterday appointing the new prime minister"".

""After the past couple of years with her family, as well, they kind of put her through the rounds a little bit. I feel quite sad for her today but I think she's with Philip, the love of her life. ""She was a mother and she had a full time job as well. Many women can relate to that. ""And she was our servant too. I just heard today that she signed off in all her communications as 'Your servant' and that just means a lot to me.""

Queen Elizabeth II has died,"Queen Elizabeth II, the UK's longest-serving monarch, has died at Balmoral aged 96, after reigning for 70 years. She died peacefully on Thursday afternoon at her Scottish estate, where she had spent much of the summer. The Queen came to the throne in 1952 and witnessed enormous social change. Her son King Charles III said the death of his beloved mother was a ""moment of great sadness"" for him and his family and that her loss would be ""deeply felt"" around the world. He said: ""We mourn profoundly the passing of a cherished sovereign and a much-loved mother. ""I know her loss will be deeply felt throughout the country, the realms and the Commonwealth, and by countless people around the world."" During the coming period of mourning, he said he and his family would be ""comforted and sustained by our knowledge of the respect and deep affection in which the Queen was so widely held"". The King and his wife, Camilla, now Queen Consort, will return to London on Friday, Buckingham Palace said. He is expected to address the nation. Senior royals had gathered at Balmoral after the Queen's doctors became concerned about her health earlier in the day. All the Queen's children travelled to Balmoral, near Aberdeen, after doctors placed the Queen under medical supervision. Her grandson and now heir to the throne, Prince William, and his brother, Prince Harry, also gathered there. Obituary: A long life marked by a sense of duty Moment her death was announced on the BBC Politicians pay tribute to Queen Elizabeth II King Charles III, the new monarch Prime Minister Liz Truss, who was appointed by the Queen on Tuesday, said the monarch was the rock on which modern Britain was built, who had ""provided us with the stability and strength that we needed"". Speaking about the new King, she said: ""We offer him our loyalty and devotion, just as his mother devoted so much, to so many, for so long. ""And with the passing of the second Elizabethan age, we usher in a new era in the magnificent history of our great country, exactly as Her Majesty would have wished, by saying the words 'God save the King'."" The Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby - spiritual leader to the Church of England of which the monarch is supreme governor - expressed his ""profound sadness"". He said his ""prayers are with the King and the Royal Family"". This video can not be played Queen's death a huge shock to the nation and the world - Prime Minister Truss Queen Elizabeth II's tenure as head of state spanned post-war austerity, the transition from empire to Commonwealth, the end of the Cold War and the UK's entry into - and withdrawal from - the European Union. Her reign spanned 15 prime ministers starting with Winston Churchill, born in 1874, and including Ms Truss, born 101 years later in 1975. She held weekly audiences with her prime minister throughout her reign. At Buckingham Palace in London, crowds awaiting updates on the Queen's condition began crying as they heard of her death. The union flag on top of the palace was lowered to half-mast at 18:30 BST and an official notice announcing the death was posted outside. On the Queen's death, Prince William and his wife, Catherine, became the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Cornwall. The official notice read: ""The Queen died peacefully at Balmoral this afternoon. The King and Queen Consort will remain at Balmoral this evening and will return to London tomorrow."" The Queen was born Elizabeth Alexandra Mary Windsor, in Mayfair, London, on 21 April 1926. Few could have foreseen she would become monarch but in December 1936 her uncle, Edward VIII, abdicated from the throne to marry the twice-divorced American, Wallis Simpson. Elizabeth's father became King George VI and, at age 10, Lilibet, as she was known in the family, became heir to the throne. Within three years, Britain was at war with Nazi Germany. Elizabeth and her younger sister, Princess Margaret, spent much of wartime at Windsor Castle after their parents rejected suggestions they be evacuated to Canada. After turning 18, Elizabeth spent five months with the Auxiliary Territorial Service and learned basic motor mechanic and driving skills. ""I began to understand the esprit de corps that flourishes in the face of adversity,"" she recalled later. Through the war, she exchanged letters with her third cousin, Philip, Prince of Greece, who was serving in the Royal Navy. Their romance blossomed and the couple married at Westminster Abbey on 20 November 1947, with the prince taking the title of Duke of Edinburgh. She would later describe him as ""my strength and stay"" through 74 years of marriage, before his death in 2021, aged 99. The Duke of Edinburgh was at the Queen's side for more than six decades of reign, becoming the longest-serving consort in British history in 2009 Their first son, Charles, was born in 1948, followed by Princess Anne, in 1950, Prince Andrew, in 1960, and Prince Edward, in 1964. Between them, they gave their parents eight grandchildren and 12 great-grandchildren. Princess Elizabeth was in Kenya in 1952, representing the ailing King, when Philip broke the news that her father had died. She immediately returned to London as the new Queen. ""It was all a very sudden kind of taking on and making the best job you can,"" she later recalled. Elizabeth was crowned at Westminster Abbey on 2 June 1953, aged 27, in front of a then-record TV audience estimated at more than 20 million people. Subsequent decades would see great change, with the end of the British Empire overseas and the Swinging '60s sweeping away social norms at home. Thousands gathered outside Buckingham Palace after the death was announced Charles, as the Prince of Wales, delivered the Queen's speech on behalf of his mother for the first time in May Elizabeth reformed the monarchy for this less deferential age, engaging with the public through walkabouts, royal visits and attendance at public events. Her commitment to the Commonwealth was a constant - she visited every Commonwealth country at least once. But there were periods of private and public pain. In 1992, the Queen's ""annus horribilis"", fire devastated Windsor Castle - a private residence as well as working palace - and three of her children's marriages broke down. After the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, in a car accident in Paris in 1997, the Queen drew criticism for appearing reluctant to respond publicly. There were questions about the monarchy's relevance in modern society. ""No institutionâ¦ should expect to be free from the scrutiny of those who give it their loyalty and support, not to mention those who don't,"" she acknowledged. Elizabeth Alexandra Mary Windsor was born in Mayfair, London, on 21 April 1926, the first child of the Duke and Duchess of York As a 21-year-old princess, Elizabeth had vowed to devote her life to service. Reflecting on those words decades later, during her Silver Jubilee in 1977, she declared: ""Although that vow was made in my salad days, when I was green in judgment, I do not regret nor retract one word of it."" That same commitment to serving was made 45 years later in a thank you letter to the nation on the weekend of her Platinum Jubilee in June. The milestone was celebrated with a mix of state ceremonies and a colourful festival of all things British, as well as lively street parties. Although the Queen's health kept her from some events, she said: ""My heart has been with you all."" In a moment met with cheers from huge crowds in the Mall, she was joined by three generations of her family on the Buckingham Palace balcony for the finale of a pageant. On her Platinum Jubilee, the Queen delighted crowds by appearing on the balcony with three generations of her family King Charles, aged 73, becomes head of state in 15 Commonwealth realms, including the UK. He and his wife, Camilla, are at Balmoral alongside his siblings, Princess Anne, and Princes Andrew and Edward. They are accompanied by Edward's wife, Sophie, as well as Princes William and Harry. William's wife, Catherine, remained at Windsor with their children - George, Charlotte and Louis - as it has been their first full day at a new school. Prince William drove a group of senior royals - including Prince Andrew and Prince Edward - to Balmoral Prince Harry arrived at Balmoral later to join other senior royals The Royal Family has now entered a period of mourning. In the coming days, much of national life will be put on hold. Official engagements will be cancelled and union flags will be flown at half-mast on royal residences, government buildings, across the Armed Forces and on UK posts overseas. Members of Parliament will pay tribute to the Queen and take an oath to King Charles. There will be church bells tolling and gun salutes as local and national organisations and charities organise ways to pay their respects, with commemorative events and books of condolence. A state funeral for the Queen is expected in the next two weeks. Foreign leaders have paid tribute to the Queen, with US President Joe Biden recalling how she stood in solidarity with the US in their ""darkest days"" after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. To France's president, Emmanuel Macron, she was a ""kind-hearted Queen"" and ""friend of France"". For Justin Trudeau, Canada's prime minister, the Queen was a constant in Canadians' lives and one of his ""favourite people in the world"".

Elsewhere,external, Low recalls how the Queen - ""with a twinkle in her eye"" - once advised a local dignitary ""during some tour or other"" not to talk to the Times' royal correspondent: he was from the Times, she said, and would only put him in the paper.

The Daily Express strips the colour from its front page and declares: ""Our beloved Queen is dead"".

The Guardian points out,externalthat her reign saw some of the greatest changes in industrial, economic, technical and social development of any era. It says, therefore, that it is difficult to see her name being bestowed, as Queen Victoria's was to the Victorians, as the ""defining symbol of an age"".

Queen Elizabeth II with her racing manager after her horse, Estimate, won the Gold Cup at Royal Ascot in 2013 Among the Queen's most well-known passions was horse racing. The outpouring from the horse racing community has been strong and emotional. Legendary jockey Sir Tony McCoy, better known as AP McCoy, led the tributes on BBC's Evening Extra programme. ""She was a hugely successful owner and breeder for pretty much all her life and she brought so much interest to it,"" he says.

Sir Tony did not go to Buckingham Palace to get his MBE in 2002 as he was racing on the day and when he came to get his OBE she said ""nice of you to come along this time"".

""I just wanted to congratulate her,"" he told BBC News NI. Imagine his surprise when, on Wednesday, a card with a special postmark landed on the doorstep. It had the royal crest on it. 

Inside was a picture of the Queen and on the back a picture of her in a more relaxed style. wearing a headscarf. ""She's such a good person and I was so surprised to get the card,"" said James. ""I felt really good. but then I was so sad to hear she had died."" Florence
Walker in Ballinamallard, County Fermanagh, has been looking at photographs of the
Royal Visit to the village in 2004, during the Queenâs Golden Jubilee. Florence

humour and they all had a good laugh over that and many of them remembered
that."" She had a great sense of humour, great twinkle in her eyes and a beautiful smile and she put everybody at ease.â  Florence also recalled the historic visit to Enniskillen during the Diamond Jubilee when the Queen crossed the street from St Macartinâs Church of Ireland Cathedral to St Michaelâs Roman Catholic Church. ""It was lovely the way she was received by all of the community and I think thatâs the one thing about her, she was the Queen of us all.â Tidying up of larger towns in the Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council area will begin tomorrow after negotiations with unions over strike action that has affected bin collections.

BBC News NI headed to Belfast's Shankill Road where there are many murals of the Queen, and she is held dearly in the hearts of the people who live there.  This video can not be played 'We are her most loyal subjects' - people on Belfast's Shankill Road react Among the thousands gathered outside Buckingham Palace, where the standard is flying and the King is in residence, is William Holland from Belfast. âItâs
sad that Elizabeth has passed away but Charles has waited a long time for this
moment. He now takes the throneâ¦ so I have mixed emotions,â he said. âThe
crowds here are tremendous. The amount of people is scary. ""The
rain hasnât put people off and the amount of different cultures here  it is
really international.â William said it would be strange now that the Queen has died. âShe
has been the Queen as long as I can remember, time will tell how it will affect
me. âWeâll
see how good a job Charles does.â Taoiseach MicheÃ¡l Martin
and Prime Minister Liz Truss spoke by phone this afternoon, with Mr Martin extending his condolences to the UK government, King Charles
III and the Royal Family, and the British people on the loss of Queen
Elizabeth II. He also discussed the Queen's historic state visit to Ireland in 2011 and its contribution
to advancing reconciliation and relations between the two countries.  The taoiseach also offered his congratulations to the prime minister on her appointment, and discussed a number of issues including the war in Ukraine and the Northern Ireland Protocol. They agreed to keep in close contact in the weeks ahead. Former Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader and Northern Ireland first minister Dame Arlene Foster says the Queen took a tremendous interest in Northern Ireland. ""Her work on reconciliation will probably be one of the key
parts of her legacy going forward,"" she says. Mrs Foster recalled meeting the Queen shortly after becoming first minister. ""When I met her in 2016 we had just left the Euros, we had just been beaten by Wales, and we had a conversation about that,"" she said. ""But it was very, very open - she put us all at ease, obviously realising that in my case I was a new first minister who was probably quite anxious about meeting Her Majesty The Queen. It was a memory I will cherish for as long as I live."" Dame Arlene Foster, Former NI first minister Instrumental in arranging the monumental meeting between the Queen and Sinn FÃ©in's Martin McGuinness, was Peter Sheridan, the chief executive of Co-operation Ireland. He tells BBC's Evening Extra that the meeting had been influenced by her state visit the year before to the Republic of Ireland and how well it had gone. ""I don't think anyone could have imagined it ever happening. It was extraordinary in the nature of it,"" he explains. ""I was feet away from it and I remember thinking I was going to watch it in slow motion to capture the moment,"" he says. However he says one thing that struck him was how ""ordinary"" it was at the same time. ""Here were two people who met, smiled and shook hands, something we all do as humans every day despite the significance of it,"" he says. ""The Queen achieved so much in Anglo-Irish relations on these islands and her own determination to pursue reconciliation was clear from her speech in Dublin Castle - to bow to the past but not be bound by it. Too often many of us are still bound by it, holding us back from better relations on these islands."" Peter Sheridan, Co-operation Ireland Peter Sheridan meets The Queen ""But - it's impossible not to recognise the historical significance of that moment,"" he says. Was it her biggest legacy? ""The Queen achieved so much in Anglo-Irish relations on these islands and her own determination to pursue reconciliation was clear from her speech in Dublin Castle - to bow to the past but not be bound by it,"" he says ""Too often many of us are still bound by it holding us back from better relations on these islands.""

One person who got many birthday cards from the Queen, was Ethel Barbour from Limavady, who died aged 106, less than three months from her 107th birthday, in April 2020. Her daughter, Miriam Stewart, from Coleraine, sent in a picture of her first 100th birthday card she received in 2013, with great grandson Reuben, and a picture of the last card she received before she died. Miriam says her mum loved the Queen and her parents, and indeed, the Queenâs grandmother, Queen Mary. Though, she added, ""she wasnât above criticising the occasional royal who did something she disapproved of"". ""She often talked of the radio broadcasts by the Queen's father during World War Two, and gave them great credit for staying in London with their people."" She also met the Queen's sister, Princess Margaret, when she visited Limavady in 1963, and was given the job of entertaining her. She met the Queen when she accompanied her husband to Buckingham Palace when he got the MBE in 1981. It's been confirmed that Northern Ireland Assembly members will gather in the assembly chamber in Stormont at 12:30 on Monday to pay tributes to the Queen. Assembly Speaker Alex Maskey wrote to assembly members to confirm the timing of the sitting. He also said a book of condolence will open afterwards in Stormont for assembly members and other users of the building. A link to the official online books of condolences will be posted on the assembly's website. The letter added that Mr Maskey would meet party whips on Friday evening to make arrangements for the expression of condolences in the chamber on Monday.

The response from the ordinary person on the street [in the Republic], indicated the welcome there was in the south for a new beginning and for relations north south and east west."" Peter Robinson, Former NI first minister The Queen was ""prepared to go the second mile, she was an encourager all the way"" for the peace process in Northern Ireland, former first minister Peter Robinson told Radio Ulster. In his role, he met the Queen on a number of occasions and also got to know her in private audiences. ""She was a wonderful person, she was driven by faith and duty,"" he said. ""Those who met her personally found that infectious spirit she had."" When the cameras were not around, Mr Robinson said that he found she had been ""well briefed"" and had a """"really acute inquiring mind"". ""She went for the kind of areas you weren't expecting. She'd ask: What is it like to work with him?"" he said. This was not just about Sinn FÃ©in's Martin McGuinness, the late deputy first minister, but other politicians well known in Northern Ireland, he said. Speaking about the historic handshake between Her Majesty and Mr McGuinness, he said: ""It wasn't an easy occasion for either of the two individuals. ""There was a lot of history on both sides. It was an important part of our overall process.  The flag at the Irish Embassy in London has been lowered to half-mast. On Thursday, flags outside government buildings in the Republic of Ireland were lowered to half-mast. Taoiseach (Irish PM) MicheÃ¡l Martin said that the Queen's death marked the ""end of an era"".

Politicians and church leaders have sent their condolences to the Royal family. ""This is just the saddest news and our hearts are breaking. ""Her Majesty The Queen was a wonderful lady and I had the privilege of meeting her many times including here at Hillsborough Castle. ""People right across Northern Ireland tonight will be deeply sorrowful for the loss of this marvellous, wonderful Queen. ""There is no doubt Her Majesty The Queen played a very important role in helping to build reconciliation. Her visit to Dublin was a cathartic moment in the history of British-Irish relations."" ""I wish to extend deepest sympathy to the British Royal Family on the death of Queen Elizabeth II. ""Her passing marks the end of an era. ""Relationships between our two countries, for so long marked by conflict and suffering, have been recast and reimagined through the Good Friday Agreement. ""The Queen proved a powerful advocate and ally of those who believe in peace and reconciliation. ""I salute her contribution to the huge change that has evolved in recent years."" ""The Queen's passing is indeed the end of an era. Her state visit to Ireland in 2011 marked a crucial step in the normalisation of relations with our nearest neighbour. ""That visit was a great success, largely because of the many gracious gestures and warm remarks made by the Queen during her time in Ireland. ""Her popularity with the Irish people was also very evident and clearly made a very positive impact on the Queen. In particular, I recall the warmth of the welcome she received from the public in Cork during her walkabout at the English Market. ""To her grieving family and people, the Irish government join with you in mourning the loss of an exceptional woman who led by quiet and dignified example and who touched so many lives over her exceptionally long reign."" ""It is with profound regret and a deep personal sadness that I have learnt of the passing of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II. ""On behalf of the people of Ireland, may I express my heartfelt sympathy to His Majesty King Charles and to the Royal Family on their very great personal loss. ""May I offer my deepest condolences to the British people and to the members of the Commonwealth on the loss of a unique, committed and deeply respected Head of State. ""Her Majesty served the British people with exceptional dignity. ""Her personal commitment to her role and extraordinary sense of duty were the hallmarks of her period as Queen, which will hold a unique place in British history."" ""I am deeply saddened at the news of the loss of Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth II. ""Throughout her reign, Her Majesty has been the matriarch and pillar of our country and the Commonwealth. ""She has always provided wise counsel, admirably and selflessly, fulfilling a lifetime commitment to public service. ""Her Majesty dedicated herself to our family of nations - no more so was this apparent than in Northern Ireland. ""We will always be greatly indebted for her efforts to promote reconciliation and the fostering of better community relations, ensuring peace and stability."" ""Queen Elizabeth II was, without doubt, one of the most consequential civic figures of the last century. ""My thoughts and the thoughts of all those in the SDLP are with Queen Elizabeth's family at an extraordinarily difficult time. ""The blessing of a long life does not make the burden of saying goodbye any lighter.

""Elizabeth's influence on Ireland, our people and our peace cannot be underestimated."" ""The passing of Queen Elizabeth II is one of the saddest days the United Kingdom has ever known. ""The Queen was a regular visitor to Northern Ireland in good times and bad, and even during the decades of violence she was determined to come here to see her people and, in the process, provide comfort and reassurance. ""Her state visit to the Republic of Ireland in May 2011 went a long way to healing old wounds and normalising relations between two close neighbours and indicated very clearly her great wisdom and sound instincts.

""Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II is one of the figures who came to define the 20th Century, as well as a large part of the 21st due not only to her longevity but her commitment and dedication to the country and Commonwealth. ""The majority of us have only ever known her in the role of sovereign and it will be incredibly strange to not see her there carrying out her duties.

Â ""Since the Queen's coronation in 1953, she has shown immense commitment, not only to her royal duties and responsibilities, but also to the wider common good.Â ""What stands out for me is her dedication to faith, to family, and to peace and reconciliation."" ""All deaths are inevitable, but few are as unimaginable as that of Queen Elizabeth II. ""For all who met her, it was clear that she was interested in people from all backgrounds and that she respected them. ""In the privacy of their meetings she also shared the riches of her incomparable experience of public affairs with 15 prime ministers. ""Her many visits to Northern Ireland were evidence of her awareness that she had been crowned Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and her conscientiousness in living out that role."" ""For those in Northern Ireland who express their loyalty to the Crown, few can remember a time when The Queen was not part of the very fabric of national life, as her Platinum Jubilee in June demonstrated. ""At the same time, for many who do not share that same sense of loyalty, in her long life Queen Elizabeth became one of the most recognisable and respected figures across these islands.

The Queen's delight at trips to Northern Ireland,"A smiling Queen greets guests during a garden party in Coleraine, Northern Ireland in June 2007 during an one-day visit to Northern Ireland The Queen played a part in Northern Ireland's peace process with her words and her actions. She visited Belfast more than 20 times but it was perhapsher visit to Dublin in 2011that was the most politically and historically significant. She was the first British monarch to visit the city for more than 100 years. The Queen was also the first to set foot in the Republic of Ireland since it gained independence, following the Anglo-Irish war. She used the ground-breaking four-day trip to try to heal the wounds of the past. Irish President Mary McAleese and Queen Elizabeth II laid a wreath at Dublin's Garden of Rememberance in May 2011 This was epitomised by her address to a state banquet in Dublin when she began by speaking in Irish. The then Irish president Mary McAleese looked stunned, and exclaimed: ""Wow"". It was seen as a personal way of making the political point that after many years of hostility, Ireland and Britain were now friends. The Queen also laid a wreath at the Dublin's Garden of Remembrance, which commemorates those who fought against Britain to achieve Irish independence. The following year, the Queen shook hands with Sinn FÃ©in's Martin McGuinness, a former IRA leader at an event in Belfast. Queen Elizabeth's historic four-second handshake with former IRA leader Martin McGuinness in Belfast on 27 June 2012 Again, it was seen as a bridge-building gesture. In 1979, Lord Louis Mountbatten, who was related to the Royal family, was killed by the IRA while holidaying on the Irish coast. For security reasons, the Queen's visits to Northern Ireland were less frequent during the violent years of the 1970s, 1980s and early 1990s. The then Princess Elizabeth waving as she arrived at Dungannon High School for Girls in County Tyrone in March 1946 She visited in the summer of 1977 on the Royal yacht Britannia as part of her silver jubilee celebrations, but did not return until June 1991. Her first visit to Northern Ireland was back in 1945, one of three visits before she became Queen. In July 1953, she made her first visit as monarch. When she stayed overnight at Hillsborough Castle, local Orangemen arrived playing Lambeg drums to mark her coronation. In total, she made 25 visits to Northern Ireland, the majority of them coming in the 1990s and 2000s after the peace process took hold. John Warden Brooke, 2nd Viscount Brookeborough (L), Queen Elizabeth II and her husband Prince Philip listen to drummers in July 1953 during an official visit to Northern Ireland Following the Good Friday Agreement, she visited the power-sharing Northern Ireland Assembly at Stormont in 2002. In an address, she said: ""Over the last half century I have always enjoyed my visits to Northern Ireland. Even in the most troubled of times I have been heartened by the warmth and good humour of the people I have met."" The Queen and Duke of Edinburgh arrive to attend a State Banquet in Dublin Castle in May 2011 in Dublin, Ireland Ten years later, she returned to Stormont, and was driven through the estate in an open-topped vehicle. An estimated 20,000 people gathered to see her and the Duke of Edinburgh. In 2014, she visited Belfast's largest indoor market, St George's, and was shown around by the then chief executive of Belfast City Council, Suzanne Wylie. Security staff had a momentary scare when a teenager suddenly emerged from the crowd in front of the Queen, but it was merely to take a ""selfie"" photograph with the monarch. The Royal couple chat to stall holder Simon Matthews during a visit to St George's market in Belfast in June 2014 in Belfast During her many speeches and statements about Northern Ireland, she always chose her words carefully. In remarks issued to mark the centenary of Northern Ireland in May 2021, she said: ""The continued peace is a credit to its people, upon whose shoulders the future rests.""

A life marked by a sense of duty,"The long reign of Queen Elizabeth II was marked by her strong sense of duty and her determination to dedicate her life to her throne and to her people. She became for many the one constant point in a rapidly changing world as British influence declined, society changed beyond recognition and the role of the monarchy itself came into question. Her success in maintaining the monarchy through such turbulent times was even more remarkable given that, at the time of her birth, no-one could have foreseen that the throne would be her destiny. Elizabeth Alexandra Mary Windsor was born on 21 April 1926, in a house just off Berkeley Square in London, the first child of Albert, Duke of York, second son of George V, and his duchess, the former Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon. Baby Elizabeth with her parents at her christening Both Elizabeth and her sister, Margaret Rose, who was born in 1930, were educated at home and brought up in a loving family atmosphere. Elizabeth was extremely close to both her father and her grandfather, George V. At the age of six, Elizabeth told her riding instructor that she wanted to become a ""country lady with lots of horses and dogs"". She was said to have shown a remarkable sense of responsibility from a very early age. Winston Churchill, the future prime minister, was quoted as saying that she possessed ""an air of authority that was astonishing in an infant"". Despite not attending school, Elizabeth proved adept at languages and made a detailed study of constitutional history. A special Girl Guides company, the 1st Buckingham Palace, was formed so that she could socialise with girls of her own age. On the death of George V in 1936, his eldest son, known as David, became Edward VIII. However, his choice of wife, the twice-divorced American Wallis Simpson, was deemed to be unacceptable on political and religious grounds. At the end of the year he abdicated. Princess Elizabeth, with her parents and younger sister Margaret, at the time of her father's ""very, very wonderful"" Coronation Princesses Elizabeth (right) and Margaret broadcast to the nation in World War Two A reluctant Duke of York became King George VI. His Coronation gave Elizabeth a foretaste of what lay in store for her and she later wrote that she had found the service ""very, very wonderful"". Against a background of increasing tension in Europe, the new King, together with his wife, Queen Elizabeth, set out to restore public faith in the monarchy. Their example was not lost on their elder daughter. In 1939, the 13-year-old princess accompanied the King and Queen to the Royal Naval College at Dartmouth. Together with her sister Margaret, she was escorted by one of the cadets, her third cousin, Prince Philip of Greece. It was not the first time they had met, but it was the first time she took an interest in him. Prince Philip called on his royal relatives when on leave from the navy, and by 1944, when she was 18, Elizabeth was clearly in love with him. She kept his picture in her room and they exchanged letters. The young princess briefly joined the Auxiliary Territorial Service (ATS) towards the end of the war, learning to drive and service a lorry. On VE Day, she joined the Royal Family at Buckingham Palace as thousands gathered in The Mall to celebrate the end of the war in Europe. ""We asked my parents if we could go out and see for ourselves,"" she later recalled. ""I remember we were terrified of being recognised. I remember lines of unknown people linking arms and walking down Whitehall, all of us just swept along on a tide of happiness and relief."" After the war, her desire to marry Prince Philip faced a number of obstacles. The King was reluctant to lose a daughter on whom he doted, and Philip had to overcome the prejudice of an establishment that could not accept his foreign ancestry. Princess Elizabeth's wedding to Philip Mountbatten brightened the post-war gloom But the wishes of the couple prevailed and on 20 November 1947 the couple married in Westminster Abbey. The Duke of Edinburgh, as Philip had become, remained a serving naval officer. For a short time, a posting to Malta meant the young couple could enjoy a relatively normal life. Their first child, Charles, was born in 1948, followed by a sister, Anne, who arrived in 1950. But the King, having suffered considerable stress during the war years, was terminally ill with lung cancer, brought about by a lifetime of heavy smoking. In January 1952, Elizabeth, then 25, set off with Philip for an overseas tour. The King, against medical advice, went to the airport to see the couple off. It was to be the last time Elizabeth would see her father. Elizabeth heard of the death of the King while staying at a game lodge in Kenya and the new Queen immediately returned to London. ""In a way, I didn't have an apprenticeship,"" she later recalled. ""My father died much too young, so it was all a very sudden kind of taking on and making the best job you can."" Her Coronation in June 1953 was televised, despite the opposition of Prime Minister Winston Churchill, and millions gathered around TV sets, many of them for the first time, to watch as Queen Elizabeth II made her oath. With Britain still enduring post-war austerity, commentators saw the Coronation as the dawn of a new Elizabethan age. World War Two had served to hasten the end of the British Empire, and by the time the new Queen set off on a lengthy tour of the Commonwealth in November 1953, many former British possessions, including India, had gained independence. Her Coronation was the first to be broadcast live on British TV Elizabeth became the first reigning monarch to visit Australia and New Zealand. It was estimated that three-quarters of Australians turned out to see her in person. Throughout the 1950s, more countries hauled down the union flag and the former colonies and dominions now came together as a voluntary family of nations. Many politicians felt that the new Commonwealth could become a counter to the newly emerging European Economic Community and, to some extent, British policy turned away from the Continent. Her visit to the US in 1957 was just one of many overseas tours But the decline of British influence was hastened by the Suez debacle in 1956, when it became clear that the Commonwealth lacked the collective will to act together in times of crisis. The decision to send British troops to try to prevent Egypt's threatened nationalisation of the Suez Canal ended in an ignominious withdrawal and brought about the resignation of Prime Minister Anthony Eden. This embroiled the Queen in a political crisis. The Conservative Party had no mechanism for electing a new leader and, after a series of consultations, the Queen invited Harold Macmillan to form a new government. The Queen also found herself the subject of a personal attack by the writer Lord Altrincham. In a magazine article, he claimed her court was ""too British"" and ""upper-class"" and accused her of being unable to make a simple speech without a written text. His remarks caused a furore in the press and Lord Altrincham was physically attacked in the street by a member of the League of Empire Loyalists. Nevertheless, the incident demonstrated that British society and attitudes to the monarchy were changing fast and old certainties were being questioned. Encouraged by her husband, notoriously impatient with the court's stuffiness, the Queen began to adapt to the new order. The practice of receiving debutantes at court was abolished and the term ""the Monarchy"" was gradually replaced by ""the Royal Family"". The Queen was once more at the centre of a political row when in 1963, Harold Macmillan stood down as prime minister. With the Conservative Party still to set up a system for choosing a new leader, she followed his advice to appoint the Earl of Home in his place. It was a difficult time for the Queen. The hallmark of her reign was constitutional correctness, and a further separation of the monarchy from the government of the day. She took seriously her rights to be informed, to advise and to warn - but did not seek to step beyond them. It was to be the last time she would be put in such a position. The Conservatives finally did away with the tradition that new party leaders just ""emerged"", and a proper system was put in place. The documentary Royal Family gave an unprecedented look behind the public face of the monarchy By the late 1960s, Buckingham Palace had decided that it needed to take a positive step to show the Royal Family in a far less formal and more approachable way. The result was a ground-breaking documentary, Royal Family. The BBC was allowed to film the Windsors at home. There were pictures of the family at a barbecue, decorating the Christmas tree, taking their children for a drive - all ordinary activities, but never seen before. Critics claimed that Richard Cawston's film destroyed the mystique of the royals by showing them to be ordinary people, including scenes of the Duke of Edinburgh barbecuing sausages in the grounds at Balmoral. But the film echoed the more relaxed mood of the times and did much to restore public support for the monarchy. By 1977, the Silver Jubilee was celebrated with genuine enthusiasm in street parties and in ceremonies across the kingdom. The monarchy seemed secure in the public's affection and much of that was down to the Queen herself. Two years later, Britain had, in Margaret Thatcher, its first woman prime minister. Relations between the female head of state and female head of government were sometimes said to have been awkward. One difficult area was the Queen's devotion to the Commonwealth, of which she was head. The Queen knew the leaders of Africa well and was sympathetic to their cause. She was reported to have found Thatcher's attitude and confrontational style ""puzzling"", not least over the prime minister's opposition to sanctions against apartheid South Africa. Year by year, the Queen's public duties continued. After the Gulf War in 1991, she went to the United States to become the first British monarch to address a joint session of Congress. President George HW Bush said she had been ""freedom's friend for as long as we can remember"". The Windsor Castle fire contributed to the Queen's ""annus horribilis"" However, a year later, a series of scandals and disasters began to affect the Royal Family. The Queen's second son, the Duke of York, and his wife Sarah separated, while Princess Anne's marriage to Mark Phillips ended in divorce. Then the Prince and Princess of Wales were revealed to be deeply unhappy and eventually split up. The year culminated in a huge fire at the Queen's favourite residence, Windsor Castle. It seemed a grimly appropriate symbol of a royal house in trouble. It was not helped by a public row over whether the taxpayer, or the Queen, should foot the bill for the repairs. The Queen described 1992 as her ""annus horribilis"" and, in a speech in the City of London, appeared to concede the need for a more open monarchy in return for a less hostile media. ""No institution, city, monarchy, whatever, should expect to be free from the scrutiny of those who give it their loyalty and support, not to mention those who don't. But we are all part of the same fabric of our national society and that scrutiny can be just as effective if it is made with a measure of gentleness, good humour and understanding."" The institution of monarchy was very much on the defensive. Buckingham Palace was opened to visitors to raise money to pay for the repairs at Windsor and it was announced that the Queen and the Prince of Wales would pay tax on investment income. The Queen was committed to the Commonwealth throughout her reign Abroad, the hopes for the Commonwealth, so high early in her reign, had not been fulfilled. Britain had turned its back on its old partners with new arrangements in Europe. The Queen still saw value in the Commonwealth and was deeply gratified when South Africa, where she had come of age, at last threw apartheid aside. She celebrated with a visit in March 1995. At home, the Queen sought to maintain the dignity of the monarchy while public debate continued on whether the institution had any future. The Queen faced criticism after the death of Diana, Princess of Wales As Britain struggled to find a new destiny, she tried to remain a reassuring figure, and with a sudden smile could lighten a solemn moment. The role she valued above all was that of symbol of the nation. However, the monarchy was shaken and the Queen herself attracted unusual criticism after the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, in a car accident in Paris in August 1997. As the public crowded around the palaces in London with tributes of flowers, the Queen seemed reluctant to provide the focus that she had always tried to do during great national moments. Many of her critics failed to understand that she was from a generation that recoiled from the almost hysterical displays of public mourning that typified the aftermath of the princess's death. She also felt as a caring grandmother that she needed to comfort Diana's sons in the privacy of the family circle. Eventually, she made a live broadcast, paying tribute to her daughter-in-law and making a commitment that the monarchy would adapt. The deaths of the Queen Mother and Princess Margaret, in the Queen's Golden Jubilee year, 2002, cast a shadow over nationwide celebrations of her reign. But despite this, and the recurring debate over the future of the monarchy, a million people crowded into The Mall, in front of Buckingham Palace, on the evening of the jubilee. The wedding of Prince William to Catherine Middleton was a happy occasion In April 2006, thousands of well-wishers lined the streets of Windsor as the Queen performed an informal walkabout on her 80th birthday. And in November 2007, she and Prince Philip celebrated 60 years of marriage with a service attended by 2,000 people at Westminster Abbey. There was yet another happy occasion in April 2011 when the Queen attended the wedding of her grandson, William, Duke of Cambridge, to Catherine Middleton. In May that year she became the first British monarch to make an official visit to the Irish Republic, an event of great historical significance. In a speech, which she began in Irish, she called for forbearance and conciliation and referred to ""things we wish had been done differently or not at all"". A year later, on a visit to Northern Ireland as part of the Diamond Jubilee celebrations, she shook hands with the former IRA commander Martin McGuinness. It was a poignant moment for a monarch whose much-loved cousin, Lord Louis Mountbatten, had been killed by an IRA bomb in 1979. Her handshake with Martin McGuinness was a landmark moment The Diamond Jubilee brought hundreds of thousands of people on to the streets and culminated in a weekend of celebrations in London. The referendum on Scottish independence, in September 2014, was a testing time for the Queen. Few had forgotten her speech to Parliament in 1977 in which she made clear her commitment to a United Kingdom. ""I number kings and queens of England and of Scotland, and princes of Wales among my ancestors and so I can readily understand these aspirations. But I cannot forget that I was crowned Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland."" In a remark to well-wishers at Balmoral on the eve of the Scottish referendum, which was overheard, she said she hoped people would think very carefully about the future. Once the result of the vote was known, her public statement underlined the relief she felt that the Union was still intact, although recognising that the political landscape had changed. ""Now, as we move forward, we should remember that despite the range of views that have been expressed, we have in common an enduring love of Scotland, which is one of the things that helps to unite us all."" In later years the Queen withdrew from much of public life though she appeared on the balcony at Buckingham Palace for her Platinum Jubilee in 2022 On 9 September 2015 she became the longest reigning monarch in British history, surpassing the reign of her great-great-grandmother Queen Victoria. In typical style she refused to make any fuss saying the title was ""not one to which I have ever aspired"". Less than a year later, in April 2016, she celebrated her 90th birthday. She continued with her public duties, often alone after the retirement of the Duke of Edinburgh in 2017. There were continued strains on the family - including her husband's car accident, the Duke of York's ill-judged friendship with convicted American businessman Jeffrey Epstein and Prince Harry's growing disillusionment with life in the royal family. These were unsettling moments, presided over by a monarch who demonstrated that she was still firmly in control. There was also the death of Prince Philip in April 2021, in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, and her Platinum Jubilee a year later. Although the monarchy might not have been as strong at the end of the Queen's reign as it was at the start, she was determined that it should continue to command a place of affection and respect in the hearts of the British people. On the occasion of her Silver Jubilee, she recalled the pledge she had made on a visit to South Africa 30 years before. ""When I was 21, I pledged my life to the service of our people and I asked for God's help to make good that vow. Although that vow was made in my salad days, when I was green in judgement, I do not regret, or retract, one word of it."" The British Monarchy Â© 2025 BBC.

have the honour to write the closing message on this page of thousands of
tributes to Queen Elizabeth II. And itâs a message of thanks to every single
person who has taken the time to share their story. When the death of Queen Elizabeth was
announced, we at the BBC wanted to create a place where people could come
together to share their tributes, their photos and recollections. The
response has been incredible. We have received thousands of touching stories of
meeting the Queen, special moments, memories and messages of condolence. Thank you to everyone - from all
over the world - for coming together here in this virtual space for very real
acts a of remembrance. Looking at the contributions, the
common theme that emerges is that the Queen had a way of making each person she
met feel like the most important person in that moment. Thank you again for helping us remember
a woman whose promise to serve her people was fulfilled through a life of duty,
which touched so many people. Over the past 10 days, we've been asking you to share your memories of seeing and meeting Queen Elizabeth II or to send in your personal tributes. Thousands of people have sent their own messages of condolence. ""The stories speak to how many people felt a personal connection to Her Majesty,"" says BBC Media and Arts Correspondent David Sillito. ""It reminds us that, while the official record of the life of the Queen will be a series of great moments of national pageantry, those were rare special occasions. ""Her life was much more about handshakes, birthday cards and meeting ordinary, but often remarkable, people. ""No-one forgets a conversation with the Queen. And our tributes page has been a little reminder that for hundreds of thousands of us, the Queen was more than a distant figure in a palace. She was someone with whom they felt a personal connection."" You can read more from David on the tributes here. Sibella Laing went to Cambridge University with King Charles III, has known the Royal Family since she was a child and has met the Queen. She was, is, and always has been, incredibly kind to everybody, always anxious to put people at their ease, always anxious to make you feel you are the only person in the room.  Iâm sure this huge support across the country that Charles must have been seeing will have been really inspirational and uplifting for him. He has had the Queen as a wonderful role model all his life and I think in a sense his whole life has been preparation for this, so I think he is ready for it."" Sibella Laing Dinkie Flowers in the queue to pay her respects to Queen Elizabeth II in Westminster Hall Dinkie Flowers (nee Stapleton), aged 101, queued for several hours on Saturday to pay her respects to Queen Elizabeth II. Dinkie, who lives in Shoreham-by-Sea is holding a letter she received from Buckingham Palace 70 years ago thanking her for her performance in the Celebrity Ice Show at Queens Ice Dance Club on 30 April 1952. Dinkie entertained other members of the public in the queue with some of her memorabilia including the card from Her Majesty for her 100th birthday in 2021. Lesley Tomlinson, Dinkie's hairdresser In Ghana students at Legon Hills International School paid tribute to her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II on the day of her funeral. The school held a special assembly reflecting her long reign. Pupils also wrote heartfelt condolence messages, while the little ones watched the Paddington film. Akua Agyemang, Founder of Legon Hills Internatonal School, Ghana The children wrote messages of farewell to the Queen Marie came to Windsor for the Queen's funeral with her friend Lee Stabler Marie Wood, 56, lived in Windsor for eight years when she was training to be a nurse and saw the Queen one day while out for a walk. Marie came to Windsor for the Queen's funeral on Monday, watching the procession from the Long Walk. I was walking in Great Park and she drove her Land Rover further up. I was just gobsmacked.  We always felt that she belonged here. This was her home. I am glad that she is in Windsor now, this was her favourite place. She will be missed."" Marie Wood Frances came from Italy to leave a portrait of the Queen drawn by her son Alex I have been living in Italy for the last 22 years. My son, Alex (13) drew this portrait of the Queen and I asked him if he wanted me to take it to London so I could leave it as a tribute for the Queen. He said yes.  On Saturday I got on a plane from Verona to come especially to leave the portrait before the funeral. Yesterday I took the 5.20am train from Havant to London and I left his portrait in Green Park. The policemen were very kind to take it for me as the park had already closed for laying flowers."" Frances King Simone Kennett was head teacher of Jersey College for Girls when the Queen visited to open a new building in 2001. The Queen said we had a beautiful school and that she had really enjoyed this visit. She made you feel as if you were important at that moment in her life. The students did the college proud and it was a successful visit.  We also had a light-hearted moment during the her visit. The Queen stamped her foot on the school's front terrace and said: 'This is hollow.' I said, 'Yes, Your Majesty, and if Your Majesty continues to bounce up and down she will find herself sitting in Home Economics,' and she absolutely roared with laughter!"" Simone Kennett, Former head of Jersey College for Girls Glyn Sherman, from Coventry, was serving in the Royal Horse Artillery in 1984 when as a guard of honour he met the Queen at a birthday parade. When she came along I said 'all right, Liz'? The top brass went to come down and she put her hand up to stop them, so I was lucky. I felt bad about it but had to explain to her that I've got a daughter called Elizabeth and it just came out like that.  She turned around and said 'I like to be unofficial sometimes'. It was brilliant. The memory will never go out of me.  Her death has left me heartbroken. I don't look at her as being Her Majesty. We call her our boss. Glyn Sherman I was born in 1926, a Londoner, and saw the Queen on the balcony with her parents on the day her father was crowned George VI. That memory is still very vivid in my mind. Beryl Smith Alicia Finn-OâShea, who is 10, met the Queen as a four-month-old baby. The family were so impressed by that encounter they named Alicia's little sister Elizabeth. She's now aged seven and prefers to be called Eliza, but they came to the Mall on Monday to watch the funeral procession with their mum Claire. It was really magical and amazing but also upsetting. The nice thought is the Queen is having marmalade sandwiches and tea with her family in heaven."" Alicia Finn-OâShea We arrived early from Birmingham to secure our place opposite Buckingham Palace gates to bid farewell to Her Majesty. We are really tired today but so happy we made it. It was an absolutely amazing day."" Claire Finn-O'Shea I used to make cakes and pastries for Her Majesty when I worked at Buckingham Palace from 2001 to 2002 and Sandringham from 2005 to 2006. I got really lucky. I did a modern apprenticeship under the patronage of the now King Charles III... On my days off I went and worked at Buckingham Palace two days a week. Over time I ended up working in the pastry kitchen and had the privilege of making some of the cakes and pastries that used to go out to the Queen during her teatime.  When I heard the news of the Queen's death I stepped outside for a good 10 minutes and really cried, I needed to get away from everyone. There are no Brits near me [in America] and so it's more of a challenge for people to understand what's going on.  It feels like more of a part of you has gone rather than a parent or relative. It feels a little bit of your identity has been lost.

The 63-year-old recalls how once at Buckingham Palace during a VJ Day parade the Queen noticed a veteran was struggling in the heat and ordered an officer to get them some water. âShe was fantastic and in charge of everything,â he says.

I was photographed handing a bouquet of flowers to the Queen with my younger sister. Prince Phillip stood alongside the Queen. The photo ended up on the front page of the local newspaper and a framed photo was proudly displayed by my parents in their hallway for at least 20 years.  You can imagine the enjoyment all my friends (and my sister) have had over the years making fun of their once angelic mate and his little sister giving flowers to the Queen but I must admit to being rather proud of the occasion, particularly now.  Rest in Peace HRH Queen Elizabeth II."" Paul Hayden The Archbishop of York Stephen Cottrell shared a jigsaw puzzle and watched TV with the Queen at Sandringham. It was a great privilege to be alongside her. We sat down after dinner and did a jigsaw and the television was on.  It's a bereavement, and with every bereavement there is shock, there is loss but there is also thankfulness for a life lived well. A life of astonishing service. She was a person of simple but profound faith, and it was that faith that shaped her.""

I think my strongest memory of the queen is how comforting her presence has been during every stage of my 28 years of life, when something difficult has happened she has comforted us with her words, when something wonderful has happened she has filled our hearts with joy, with her wonderful smile and calming presence. She has been the grandmother of our nation, the matriarch we all need in times of hardship and times of joy. Her dignity, strength and consistency has been a great comfort and I thank her for her seventy years of steadfast service. Raven Harlow Aspenwood from East Yorkshire What a smile. She could lift a room with that wonderful smile and that genuine interest that she has in the people of this country.""

Bishop of Coventry, Reverend Christopher Cocksworth Zara Umar gave flowers to the Queen in 2002 My daughter Zara and I went down to the City Square in Dundee to see the Queen in 2002. We waited for a long time. Soon the time came and the Queen was walking towards us. She was about five or six steps away from us when one of her security personnel guided the Queen away to the car to leave. Zara was so disappointed and my heart sank. Just then a plain clothes man came and asked me if he could lift Zara over the barrier. Much to my delight, Zara presented the flowers to the Queen and said 'here you are then, take your flowers.' I couldnt believe it! The Queen must have found it funny though and watched Zara return to me with a big smile on her face. I will treasure this memory forever.""

The great day came, our ladies looking beautiful, wheelchairs polished. One of our residents had worked at the palace as a younger woman and had photos of the Queen all around her room in the care home, so, if any one was to be there that day, it was her.  As the Queen approached our little group that day she asked me: âAre these the ladies from the care home?' I replied in the positive and then said this resident had worked in the palace. The Queen looked down a little and asked her: âWhen did you work at the palace?â To which, the lady looked up and and replied, in a rather gruff voice: âAnd who are you?â What a moment. I apologised. The Queen just smiled and moved on.  I was quite overwhelmed, I donât have photos of the Queen all over the house, but Iâve always respected her, especially as a Christian woman. She had a real true faith, so meeting her was very special. I didnât expect to be so overcome by the moment. Her demeanour was that of interest and she handled the situation really well.

"Queen Elizabeth II has diedHer son King Charles III pays tribute to his ""beloved mother"" who has died peacefully at Balmoral.UK","Queen Elizabeth II, the UK's longest-serving monarch, has died at Balmoral aged 96, after reigning for 70 years. She died peacefully on Thursday afternoon at her Scottish estate, where she had spent much of the summer. The Queen came to the throne in 1952 and witnessed enormous social change. Her son King Charles III said the death of his beloved mother was a ""moment of great sadness"" for him and his family and that her loss would be ""deeply felt"" around the world. He said: ""We mourn profoundly the passing of a cherished sovereign and a much-loved mother. ""I know her loss will be deeply felt throughout the country, the realms and the Commonwealth, and by countless people around the world."" During the coming period of mourning, he said he and his family would be ""comforted and sustained by our knowledge of the respect and deep affection in which the Queen was so widely held"". The King and his wife, Camilla, now Queen Consort, will return to London on Friday, Buckingham Palace said. He is expected to address the nation. Senior royals had gathered at Balmoral after the Queen's doctors became concerned about her health earlier in the day. All the Queen's children travelled to Balmoral, near Aberdeen, after doctors placed the Queen under medical supervision. Her grandson and now heir to the throne, Prince William, and his brother, Prince Harry, also gathered there. Obituary: A long life marked by a sense of duty Moment her death was announced on the BBC Politicians pay tribute to Queen Elizabeth II King Charles III, the new monarch Prime Minister Liz Truss, who was appointed by the Queen on Tuesday, said the monarch was the rock on which modern Britain was built, who had ""provided us with the stability and strength that we needed"". Speaking about the new King, she said: ""We offer him our loyalty and devotion, just as his mother devoted so much, to so many, for so long. ""And with the passing of the second Elizabethan age, we usher in a new era in the magnificent history of our great country, exactly as Her Majesty would have wished, by saying the words 'God save the King'."" The Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby - spiritual leader to the Church of England of which the monarch is supreme governor - expressed his ""profound sadness"". He said his ""prayers are with the King and the Royal Family"". This video can not be played Queen's death a huge shock to the nation and the world - Prime Minister Truss Queen Elizabeth II's tenure as head of state spanned post-war austerity, the transition from empire to Commonwealth, the end of the Cold War and the UK's entry into - and withdrawal from - the European Union. Her reign spanned 15 prime ministers starting with Winston Churchill, born in 1874, and including Ms Truss, born 101 years later in 1975. She held weekly audiences with her prime minister throughout her reign. At Buckingham Palace in London, crowds awaiting updates on the Queen's condition began crying as they heard of her death. The union flag on top of the palace was lowered to half-mast at 18:30 BST and an official notice announcing the death was posted outside. On the Queen's death, Prince William and his wife, Catherine, became the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Cornwall. The official notice read: ""The Queen died peacefully at Balmoral this afternoon. The King and Queen Consort will remain at Balmoral this evening and will return to London tomorrow."" The Queen was born Elizabeth Alexandra Mary Windsor, in Mayfair, London, on 21 April 1926. Few could have foreseen she would become monarch but in December 1936 her uncle, Edward VIII, abdicated from the throne to marry the twice-divorced American, Wallis Simpson. Elizabeth's father became King George VI and, at age 10, Lilibet, as she was known in the family, became heir to the throne. Within three years, Britain was at war with Nazi Germany. Elizabeth and her younger sister, Princess Margaret, spent much of wartime at Windsor Castle after their parents rejected suggestions they be evacuated to Canada. After turning 18, Elizabeth spent five months with the Auxiliary Territorial Service and learned basic motor mechanic and driving skills. ""I began to understand the esprit de corps that flourishes in the face of adversity,"" she recalled later. Through the war, she exchanged letters with her third cousin, Philip, Prince of Greece, who was serving in the Royal Navy. Their romance blossomed and the couple married at Westminster Abbey on 20 November 1947, with the prince taking the title of Duke of Edinburgh. She would later describe him as ""my strength and stay"" through 74 years of marriage, before his death in 2021, aged 99. The Duke of Edinburgh was at the Queen's side for more than six decades of reign, becoming the longest-serving consort in British history in 2009 Their first son, Charles, was born in 1948, followed by Princess Anne, in 1950, Prince Andrew, in 1960, and Prince Edward, in 1964. Between them, they gave their parents eight grandchildren and 12 great-grandchildren. Princess Elizabeth was in Kenya in 1952, representing the ailing King, when Philip broke the news that her father had died. She immediately returned to London as the new Queen. ""It was all a very sudden kind of taking on and making the best job you can,"" she later recalled. Elizabeth was crowned at Westminster Abbey on 2 June 1953, aged 27, in front of a then-record TV audience estimated at more than 20 million people. Subsequent decades would see great change, with the end of the British Empire overseas and the Swinging '60s sweeping away social norms at home. Thousands gathered outside Buckingham Palace after the death was announced Charles, as the Prince of Wales, delivered the Queen's speech on behalf of his mother for the first time in May Elizabeth reformed the monarchy for this less deferential age, engaging with the public through walkabouts, royal visits and attendance at public events. Her commitment to the Commonwealth was a constant - she visited every Commonwealth country at least once. But there were periods of private and public pain. In 1992, the Queen's ""annus horribilis"", fire devastated Windsor Castle - a private residence as well as working palace - and three of her children's marriages broke down. After the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, in a car accident in Paris in 1997, the Queen drew criticism for appearing reluctant to respond publicly. There were questions about the monarchy's relevance in modern society. ""No institutionâ¦ should expect to be free from the scrutiny of those who give it their loyalty and support, not to mention those who don't,"" she acknowledged. Elizabeth Alexandra Mary Windsor was born in Mayfair, London, on 21 April 1926, the first child of the Duke and Duchess of York As a 21-year-old princess, Elizabeth had vowed to devote her life to service. Reflecting on those words decades later, during her Silver Jubilee in 1977, she declared: ""Although that vow was made in my salad days, when I was green in judgment, I do not regret nor retract one word of it."" That same commitment to serving was made 45 years later in a thank you letter to the nation on the weekend of her Platinum Jubilee in June. The milestone was celebrated with a mix of state ceremonies and a colourful festival of all things British, as well as lively street parties. Although the Queen's health kept her from some events, she said: ""My heart has been with you all."" In a moment met with cheers from huge crowds in the Mall, she was joined by three generations of her family on the Buckingham Palace balcony for the finale of a pageant. On her Platinum Jubilee, the Queen delighted crowds by appearing on the balcony with three generations of her family King Charles, aged 73, becomes head of state in 15 Commonwealth realms, including the UK. He and his wife, Camilla, are at Balmoral alongside his siblings, Princess Anne, and Princes Andrew and Edward. They are accompanied by Edward's wife, Sophie, as well as Princes William and Harry. William's wife, Catherine, remained at Windsor with their children - George, Charlotte and Louis - as it has been their first full day at a new school. Prince William drove a group of senior royals - including Prince Andrew and Prince Edward - to Balmoral Prince Harry arrived at Balmoral later to join other senior royals The Royal Family has now entered a period of mourning. In the coming days, much of national life will be put on hold. Official engagements will be cancelled and union flags will be flown at half-mast on royal residences, government buildings, across the Armed Forces and on UK posts overseas. Members of Parliament will pay tribute to the Queen and take an oath to King Charles. There will be church bells tolling and gun salutes as local and national organisations and charities organise ways to pay their respects, with commemorative events and books of condolence. A state funeral for the Queen is expected in the next two weeks. Foreign leaders have paid tribute to the Queen, with US President Joe Biden recalling how she stood in solidarity with the US in their ""darkest days"" after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. To France's president, Emmanuel Macron, she was a ""kind-hearted Queen"" and ""friend of France"". For Justin Trudeau, Canada's prime minister, the Queen was a constant in Canadians' lives and one of his ""favourite people in the world"".

LiveLiveYour tributes to the Queen1 minute ago,"We've been sharing your tributes to Queen Elizabeth II following her death aged 96 You've told us what she meant to you, moments you remember from her life and your stories of meeting the UK's longest-reigning monarch On Monday, the nation paid a final farewell to the Queen, with a state funeral and military procession Our tributes page has been a reminder that hundreds of thousands of us felt a personal connection with the Queen, says BBC Media and Arts Correspondent David Sillito ""She made you feel as if you were important at that moment in her life,"" says Simone Kennett, who was head teacher of a school when it was visited by the Queen We'll be preserving this page so people in the UK and around the world can continue to read the tributes so many of you have left for the Queen Deborah TurnessCEO, BBC News and Current Affairs As the Chief Executive of BBC News I
have the honour to write the closing message on this page of thousands of
tributes to Queen Elizabeth II. And itâs a message of thanks to every single
person who has taken the time to share their story. When the death of Queen Elizabeth was
announced, we at the BBC wanted to create a place where people could come
together to share their tributes, their photos and recollections. The
response has been incredible. We have received thousands of touching stories of
meeting the Queen, special moments, memories and messages of condolence. Thank you to everyone - from all
over the world - for coming together here in this virtual space for very real
acts a of remembrance. Looking at the contributions, the
common theme that emerges is that the Queen had a way of making each person she
met feel like the most important person in that moment. Thank you again for helping us remember
a woman whose promise to serve her people was fulfilled through a life of duty,
which touched so many people. Over the past 10 days, we've been asking you to share your memories of seeing and meeting Queen Elizabeth II or to send in your personal tributes. Thousands of people have sent their own messages of condolence. ""The stories speak to how many people felt a personal connection to Her Majesty,"" says BBC Media and Arts Correspondent David Sillito. ""It reminds us that, while the official record of the life of the Queen will be a series of great moments of national pageantry, those were rare special occasions. ""Her life was much more about handshakes, birthday cards and meeting ordinary, but often remarkable, people. ""No-one forgets a conversation with the Queen. And our tributes page has been a little reminder that for hundreds of thousands of us, the Queen was more than a distant figure in a palace. She was someone with whom they felt a personal connection."" You can read more from David on the tributes here. Sibella Laing went to Cambridge University with King Charles III, has known the Royal Family since she was a child and has met the Queen. She was, is, and always has been, incredibly kind to everybody, always anxious to put people at their ease, always anxious to make you feel you are the only person in the room.  Iâm sure this huge support across the country that Charles must have been seeing will have been really inspirational and uplifting for him. He has had the Queen as a wonderful role model all his life and I think in a sense his whole life has been preparation for this, so I think he is ready for it."" Sibella Laing Dinkie Flowers in the queue to pay her respects to Queen Elizabeth II in Westminster Hall Dinkie Flowers (nee Stapleton), aged 101, queued for several hours on Saturday to pay her respects to Queen Elizabeth II. Dinkie, who lives in Shoreham-by-Sea is holding a letter she received from Buckingham Palace 70 years ago thanking her for her performance in the Celebrity Ice Show at Queens Ice Dance Club on 30 April 1952. Dinkie entertained other members of the public in the queue with some of her memorabilia including the card from Her Majesty for her 100th birthday in 2021. Lesley Tomlinson, Dinkie's hairdresser In Ghana students at Legon Hills International School paid tribute to her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II on the day of her funeral. The school held a special assembly reflecting her long reign. Pupils also wrote heartfelt condolence messages, while the little ones watched the Paddington film. Akua Agyemang, Founder of Legon Hills Internatonal School, Ghana The children wrote messages of farewell to the Queen Marie came to Windsor for the Queen's funeral with her friend Lee Stabler Marie Wood, 56, lived in Windsor for eight years when she was training to be a nurse and saw the Queen one day while out for a walk. Marie came to Windsor for the Queen's funeral on Monday, watching the procession from the Long Walk. I was walking in Great Park and she drove her Land Rover further up. I was just gobsmacked.  We always felt that she belonged here. This was her home. I am glad that she is in Windsor now, this was her favourite place. She will be missed."" Marie Wood Frances came from Italy to leave a portrait of the Queen drawn by her son Alex I have been living in Italy for the last 22 years. My son, Alex (13) drew this portrait of the Queen and I asked him if he wanted me to take it to London so I could leave it as a tribute for the Queen. He said yes.  On Saturday I got on a plane from Verona to come especially to leave the portrait before the funeral. Yesterday I took the 5.20am train from Havant to London and I left his portrait in Green Park. The policemen were very kind to take it for me as the park had already closed for laying flowers."" Frances King Simone Kennett was head teacher of Jersey College for Girls when the Queen visited to open a new building in 2001. The Queen said we had a beautiful school and that she had really enjoyed this visit. She made you feel as if you were important at that moment in her life. The students did the college proud and it was a successful visit.  We also had a light-hearted moment during the her visit. The Queen stamped her foot on the school's front terrace and said: 'This is hollow.' I said, 'Yes, Your Majesty, and if Your Majesty continues to bounce up and down she will find herself sitting in Home Economics,' and she absolutely roared with laughter!"" Simone Kennett, Former head of Jersey College for Girls Glyn Sherman, from Coventry, was serving in the Royal Horse Artillery in 1984 when as a guard of honour he met the Queen at a birthday parade. When she came along I said 'all right, Liz'? The top brass went to come down and she put her hand up to stop them, so I was lucky. I felt bad about it but had to explain to her that I've got a daughter called Elizabeth and it just came out like that.  She turned around and said 'I like to be unofficial sometimes'. It was brilliant. The memory will never go out of me.  Her death has left me heartbroken. I don't look at her as being Her Majesty. We call her our boss.

response has been incredible. We have received thousands of touching stories of
meeting the Queen, special moments, memories and messages of condolence. Thank you to everyone - from all
over the world - for coming together here in this virtual space for very real
acts a of remembrance. Looking at the contributions, the
common theme that emerges is that the Queen had a way of making each person she
met feel like the most important person in that moment. Thank you again for helping us remember
a woman whose promise to serve her people was fulfilled through a life of duty,
which touched so many people. Over the past 10 days, we've been asking you to share your memories of seeing and meeting Queen Elizabeth II or to send in your personal tributes. Thousands of people have sent their own messages of condolence. ""The stories speak to how many people felt a personal connection to Her Majesty,"" says BBC Media and Arts Correspondent David Sillito. ""It reminds us that, while the official record of the life of the Queen will be a series of great moments of national pageantry, those were rare special occasions. ""Her life was much more about handshakes, birthday cards and meeting ordinary, but often remarkable, people. ""No-one forgets a conversation with the Queen. And our tributes page has been a little reminder that for hundreds of thousands of us, the Queen was more than a distant figure in a palace. She was someone with whom they felt a personal connection."" You can read more from David on the tributes here. Sibella Laing went to Cambridge University with King Charles III, has known the Royal Family since she was a child and has met the Queen. She was, is, and always has been, incredibly kind to everybody, always anxious to put people at their ease, always anxious to make you feel you are the only person in the room.  Iâm sure this huge support across the country that Charles must have been seeing will have been really inspirational and uplifting for him. He has had the Queen as a wonderful role model all his life and I think in a sense his whole life has been preparation for this, so I think he is ready for it."" Sibella Laing Dinkie Flowers in the queue to pay her respects to Queen Elizabeth II in Westminster Hall Dinkie Flowers (nee Stapleton), aged 101, queued for several hours on Saturday to pay her respects to Queen Elizabeth II. Dinkie, who lives in Shoreham-by-Sea is holding a letter she received from Buckingham Palace 70 years ago thanking her for her performance in the Celebrity Ice Show at Queens Ice Dance Club on 30 April 1952. Dinkie entertained other members of the public in the queue with some of her memorabilia including the card from Her Majesty for her 100th birthday in 2021. Lesley Tomlinson, Dinkie's hairdresser In Ghana students at Legon Hills International School paid tribute to her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II on the day of her funeral. The school held a special assembly reflecting her long reign. Pupils also wrote heartfelt condolence messages, while the little ones watched the Paddington film. Akua Agyemang, Founder of Legon Hills Internatonal School, Ghana The children wrote messages of farewell to the Queen Marie came to Windsor for the Queen's funeral with her friend Lee Stabler Marie Wood, 56, lived in Windsor for eight years when she was training to be a nurse and saw the Queen one day while out for a walk. Marie came to Windsor for the Queen's funeral on Monday, watching the procession from the Long Walk. I was walking in Great Park and she drove her Land Rover further up. I was just gobsmacked.  We always felt that she belonged here. This was her home. I am glad that she is in Windsor now, this was her favourite place. She will be missed."" Marie Wood Frances came from Italy to leave a portrait of the Queen drawn by her son Alex I have been living in Italy for the last 22 years. My son, Alex (13) drew this portrait of the Queen and I asked him if he wanted me to take it to London so I could leave it as a tribute for the Queen. He said yes.  On Saturday I got on a plane from Verona to come especially to leave the portrait before the funeral. Yesterday I took the 5.20am train from Havant to London and I left his portrait in Green Park. The policemen were very kind to take it for me as the park had already closed for laying flowers."" Frances King Simone Kennett was head teacher of Jersey College for Girls when the Queen visited to open a new building in 2001. The Queen said we had a beautiful school and that she had really enjoyed this visit. She made you feel as if you were important at that moment in her life. The students did the college proud and it was a successful visit.  We also had a light-hearted moment during the her visit. The Queen stamped her foot on the school's front terrace and said: 'This is hollow.' I said, 'Yes, Your Majesty, and if Your Majesty continues to bounce up and down she will find herself sitting in Home Economics,' and she absolutely roared with laughter!"" Simone Kennett, Former head of Jersey College for Girls Glyn Sherman, from Coventry, was serving in the Royal Horse Artillery in 1984 when as a guard of honour he met the Queen at a birthday parade. When she came along I said 'all right, Liz'? The top brass went to come down and she put her hand up to stop them, so I was lucky. I felt bad about it but had to explain to her that I've got a daughter called Elizabeth and it just came out like that.  She turned around and said 'I like to be unofficial sometimes'. It was brilliant. The memory will never go out of me.  Her death has left me heartbroken. I don't look at her as being Her Majesty. We call her our boss. Glyn Sherman I was born in 1926, a Londoner, and saw the Queen on the balcony with her parents on the day her father was crowned George VI. That memory is still very vivid in my mind. Beryl Smith Alicia Finn-OâShea, who is 10, met the Queen as a four-month-old baby. The family were so impressed by that encounter they named Alicia's little sister Elizabeth. She's now aged seven and prefers to be called Eliza, but they came to the Mall on Monday to watch the funeral procession with their mum Claire. It was really magical and amazing but also upsetting. The nice thought is the Queen is having marmalade sandwiches and tea with her family in heaven."" Alicia Finn-OâShea We arrived early from Birmingham to secure our place opposite Buckingham Palace gates to bid farewell to Her Majesty. We are really tired today but so happy we made it. It was an absolutely amazing day."" Claire Finn-O'Shea I used to make cakes and pastries for Her Majesty when I worked at Buckingham Palace from 2001 to 2002 and Sandringham from 2005 to 2006. I got really lucky. I did a modern apprenticeship under the patronage of the now King Charles III... On my days off I went and worked at Buckingham Palace two days a week. Over time I ended up working in the pastry kitchen and had the privilege of making some of the cakes and pastries that used to go out to the Queen during her teatime.  When I heard the news of the Queen's death I stepped outside for a good 10 minutes and really cried, I needed to get away from everyone. There are no Brits near me [in America] and so it's more of a challenge for people to understand what's going on.  It feels like more of a part of you has gone rather than a parent or relative. It feels a little bit of your identity has been lost. Kieron Hales Peter John Wailes, who served in the RAF for 25 years, met the Queen many times and headed to Windsor on the day of her funeral to pay his respects. The 63-year-old recalls how once at Buckingham Palace during a VJ Day parade the Queen noticed a veteran was struggling in the heat and ordered an officer to get them some water. âShe was fantastic and in charge of everything,â he says. Iâm here to pay respects to my ex-boss, I feel great respect for her and want to say thanks for everything - I enjoyed working for her and meeting her.â Peter John Wailes Paul Hayden and his sister handing flowers to the Queen during her visit to Essex My memory is a rather distant one: I think I was about five, and the Queen visited the Essex county show. I was photographed handing a bouquet of flowers to the Queen with my younger sister. Prince Phillip stood alongside the Queen. The photo ended up on the front page of the local newspaper and a framed photo was proudly displayed by my parents in their hallway for at least 20 years.  You can imagine the enjoyment all my friends (and my sister) have had over the years making fun of their once angelic mate and his little sister giving flowers to the Queen but I must admit to being rather proud of the occasion, particularly now.  Rest in Peace HRH Queen Elizabeth II."" Paul Hayden The Archbishop of York Stephen Cottrell shared a jigsaw puzzle and watched TV with the Queen at Sandringham. It was a great privilege to be alongside her. We sat down after dinner and did a jigsaw and the television was on.  It's a bereavement, and with every bereavement there is shock, there is loss but there is also thankfulness for a life lived well. A life of astonishing service. She was a person of simple but profound faith, and it was that faith that shaped her."" Archbishop of York Stephen Cottrell Raven Harlow Aspenwood is severely visually impaired and has channeled her grief into her portrait of the young Queen Elizabeth II I am registered severely visually impaired, but I felt compelled to do something to channel my overwhelming and surprising level of grief following the sad passing of HRH, Queen Elizabeth II. I think my strongest memory of the queen is how comforting her presence has been during every stage of my 28 years of life, when something difficult has happened she has comforted us with her words, when something wonderful has happened she has filled our hearts with joy, with her wonderful smile and calming presence. She has been the grandmother of our nation, the matriarch we all need in times of hardship and times of joy. Her dignity, strength and consistency has been a great comfort and I thank her for her seventy years of steadfast service. Raven Harlow Aspenwood from East Yorkshire What a smile. She could lift a room with that wonderful smile and that genuine interest that she has in the people of this country."" Warwickshire County Council Leader, Izzi Seccombe I do remember her smile, I experienced that myself. It not only lit up a room, it lit up a nation - and she had the capacity to make us smile too."" Bishop of Coventry, Reverend Christopher Cocksworth Zara Umar gave flowers to the Queen in 2002 My daughter Zara and I went down to the City Square in Dundee to see the Queen in 2002. We waited for a long time. Soon the time came and the Queen was walking towards us. She was about five or six steps away from us when one of her security personnel guided the Queen away to the car to leave. Zara was so disappointed and my heart sank. Just then a plain clothes man came and asked me if he could lift Zara over the barrier. Much to my delight, Zara presented the flowers to the Queen and said 'here you are then, take your flowers.' I couldnt believe it! The Queen must have found it funny though and watched Zara return to me with a big smile on her face. I will treasure this memory forever."" Ishrat Umar, Dundee Three army veterans from Worcestershire pay tribute to the Queen... She was our head, she was our leader, she was the person we were serving and she's the one that we would follow. It hits you, it hits your heart."" Eric Braithwaite, who served for 23 years with the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers Everyone called her the boss in one way or another. I've actually guarded the Queen and Prince Philip on other duties. A big lump in the throat, lost the boss, getting a new one."" Dave Sandy, who served in the territorial army from the late 1970s until the 1990s I've done a lot of parades for the Queen, she was a lovely lady and worked so hard for the country. I was in tears, I will be honest. It was an honour to be with her and be a soldier for her."" Anthony Goodway, who spent two years in national service from 1958 until 1960 I met the Queen when she visited the Isle of Skye as part of her Golden Jubilee tour. As a nurse then at the local care home, myself and other staff members were invited to bring some of our residents to meet Her Majesty. The great day came, our ladies looking beautiful, wheelchairs polished. One of our residents had worked at the palace as a younger woman and had photos of the Queen all around her room in the care home, so, if any one was to be there that day, it was her.  As the Queen approached our little group that day she asked me: âAre these the ladies from the care home?' I replied in the positive and then said this resident had worked in the palace. The Queen looked down a little and asked her: âWhen did you work at the palace?â To which, the lady looked up and and replied, in a rather gruff voice: âAnd who are you?â What a moment. I apologised. The Queen just smiled and moved on.  I was quite overwhelmed, I donât have photos of the Queen all over the house, but Iâve always respected her, especially as a Christian woman. She had a real true faith, so meeting her was very special. I didnât expect to be so overcome by the moment. Her demeanour was that of interest and she handled the situation really well. She left us all feeling very special and honoured. Barbara Matheson from Glasgow Barbara Matheson has recalled the moment she met the Queen during Her Majesty's Golden Jubilee tour Â© 2025 BBC.

The students did the college proud and it was a successful visit.  We also had a light-hearted moment during the her visit. The Queen stamped her foot on the school's front terrace and said: 'This is hollow.' I said, 'Yes, Your Majesty, and if Your Majesty continues to bounce up and down she will find herself sitting in Home Economics,' and she absolutely roared with laughter!"" Simone Kennett, Former head of Jersey College for Girls Glyn Sherman, from Coventry, was serving in the Royal Horse Artillery in 1984 when as a guard of honour he met the Queen at a birthday parade. When she came along I said 'all right, Liz'? The top brass went to come down and she put her hand up to stop them, so I was lucky. I felt bad about it but had to explain to her that I've got a daughter called Elizabeth and it just came out like that.  She turned around and said 'I like to be unofficial sometimes'. It was brilliant. The memory will never go out of me.  Her death has left me heartbroken. I don't look at her as being Her Majesty. We call her our boss. Glyn Sherman I was born in 1926, a Londoner, and saw the Queen on the balcony with her parents on the day her father was crowned George VI. That memory is still very vivid in my mind. Beryl Smith Alicia Finn-OâShea, who is 10, met the Queen as a four-month-old baby. The family were so impressed by that encounter they named Alicia's little sister Elizabeth. She's now aged seven and prefers to be called Eliza, but they came to the Mall on Monday to watch the funeral procession with their mum Claire. It was really magical and amazing but also upsetting. The nice thought is the Queen is having marmalade sandwiches and tea with her family in heaven."" Alicia Finn-OâShea We arrived early from Birmingham to secure our place opposite Buckingham Palace gates to bid farewell to Her Majesty. We are really tired today but so happy we made it. It was an absolutely amazing day."" Claire Finn-O'Shea I used to make cakes and pastries for Her Majesty when I worked at Buckingham Palace from 2001 to 2002 and Sandringham from 2005 to 2006. I got really lucky. I did a modern apprenticeship under the patronage of the now King Charles III... On my days off I went and worked at Buckingham Palace two days a week. Over time I ended up working in the pastry kitchen and had the privilege of making some of the cakes and pastries that used to go out to the Queen during her teatime.  When I heard the news of the Queen's death I stepped outside for a good 10 minutes and really cried, I needed to get away from everyone. There are no Brits near me [in America] and so it's more of a challenge for people to understand what's going on.  It feels like more of a part of you has gone rather than a parent or relative. It feels a little bit of your identity has been lost. Kieron Hales Peter John Wailes, who served in the RAF for 25 years, met the Queen many times and headed to Windsor on the day of her funeral to pay his respects. The 63-year-old recalls how once at Buckingham Palace during a VJ Day parade the Queen noticed a veteran was struggling in the heat and ordered an officer to get them some water. âShe was fantastic and in charge of everything,â he says. Iâm here to pay respects to my ex-boss, I feel great respect for her and want to say thanks for everything - I enjoyed working for her and meeting her.â Peter John Wailes Paul Hayden and his sister handing flowers to the Queen during her visit to Essex My memory is a rather distant one: I think I was about five, and the Queen visited the Essex county show. I was photographed handing a bouquet of flowers to the Queen with my younger sister. Prince Phillip stood alongside the Queen. The photo ended up on the front page of the local newspaper and a framed photo was proudly displayed by my parents in their hallway for at least 20 years.  You can imagine the enjoyment all my friends (and my sister) have had over the years making fun of their once angelic mate and his little sister giving flowers to the Queen but I must admit to being rather proud of the occasion, particularly now.  Rest in Peace HRH Queen Elizabeth II."" Paul Hayden The Archbishop of York Stephen Cottrell shared a jigsaw puzzle and watched TV with the Queen at Sandringham. It was a great privilege to be alongside her. We sat down after dinner and did a jigsaw and the television was on.  It's a bereavement, and with every bereavement there is shock, there is loss but there is also thankfulness for a life lived well. A life of astonishing service. She was a person of simple but profound faith, and it was that faith that shaped her."" Archbishop of York Stephen Cottrell Raven Harlow Aspenwood is severely visually impaired and has channeled her grief into her portrait of the young Queen Elizabeth II I am registered severely visually impaired, but I felt compelled to do something to channel my overwhelming and surprising level of grief following the sad passing of HRH, Queen Elizabeth II. I think my strongest memory of the queen is how comforting her presence has been during every stage of my 28 years of life, when something difficult has happened she has comforted us with her words, when something wonderful has happened she has filled our hearts with joy, with her wonderful smile and calming presence. She has been the grandmother of our nation, the matriarch we all need in times of hardship and times of joy. Her dignity, strength and consistency has been a great comfort and I thank her for her seventy years of steadfast service. Raven Harlow Aspenwood from East Yorkshire What a smile. She could lift a room with that wonderful smile and that genuine interest that she has in the people of this country."" Warwickshire County Council Leader, Izzi Seccombe I do remember her smile, I experienced that myself. It not only lit up a room, it lit up a nation - and she had the capacity to make us smile too."" Bishop of Coventry, Reverend Christopher Cocksworth Zara Umar gave flowers to the Queen in 2002 My daughter Zara and I went down to the City Square in Dundee to see the Queen in 2002. We waited for a long time. Soon the time came and the Queen was walking towards us. She was about five or six steps away from us when one of her security personnel guided the Queen away to the car to leave. Zara was so disappointed and my heart sank. Just then a plain clothes man came and asked me if he could lift Zara over the barrier. Much to my delight, Zara presented the flowers to the Queen and said 'here you are then, take your flowers.' I couldnt believe it! The Queen must have found it funny though and watched Zara return to me with a big smile on her face. I will treasure this memory forever."" Ishrat Umar, Dundee Three army veterans from Worcestershire pay tribute to the Queen... She was our head, she was our leader, she was the person we were serving and she's the one that we would follow. It hits you, it hits your heart."" Eric Braithwaite, who served for 23 years with the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers Everyone called her the boss in one way or another. I've actually guarded the Queen and Prince Philip on other duties. A big lump in the throat, lost the boss, getting a new one."" Dave Sandy, who served in the territorial army from the late 1970s until the 1990s I've done a lot of parades for the Queen, she was a lovely lady and worked so hard for the country. I was in tears, I will be honest. It was an honour to be with her and be a soldier for her."" Anthony Goodway, who spent two years in national service from 1958 until 1960 I met the Queen when she visited the Isle of Skye as part of her Golden Jubilee tour. As a nurse then at the local care home, myself and other staff members were invited to bring some of our residents to meet Her Majesty. The great day came, our ladies looking beautiful, wheelchairs polished. One of our residents had worked at the palace as a younger woman and had photos of the Queen all around her room in the care home, so, if any one was to be there that day, it was her.  As the Queen approached our little group that day she asked me: âAre these the ladies from the care home?' I replied in the positive and then said this resident had worked in the palace. The Queen looked down a little and asked her: âWhen did you work at the palace?â To which, the lady looked up and and replied, in a rather gruff voice: âAnd who are you?â What a moment. I apologised. The Queen just smiled and moved on.  I was quite overwhelmed, I donât have photos of the Queen all over the house, but Iâve always respected her, especially as a Christian woman. She had a real true faith, so meeting her was very special. I didnât expect to be so overcome by the moment. Her demeanour was that of interest and she handled the situation really well. She left us all feeling very special and honoured. Barbara Matheson from Glasgow Barbara Matheson has recalled the moment she met the Queen during Her Majesty's Golden Jubilee tour Â© 2025 BBC.

LiveLiveYour tributes to the Queen7 minutes ago,"We've been sharing your tributes to Queen Elizabeth II following her death aged 96 You've told us what she meant to you, moments you remember from her life and your stories of meeting the UK's longest-reigning monarch On Monday, the nation paid a final farewell to the Queen, with a state funeral and military procession Our tributes page has been a reminder that hundreds of thousands of us felt a personal connection with the Queen, says BBC Media and Arts Correspondent David Sillito ""She made you feel as if you were important at that moment in her life,"" says Simone Kennett, who was head teacher of a school when it was visited by the Queen We'll be preserving this page so people in the UK and around the world can continue to read the tributes so many of you have left for the Queen Deborah TurnessCEO, BBC News and Current Affairs As the Chief Executive of BBC News I
have the honour to write the closing message on this page of thousands of
tributes to Queen Elizabeth II. And itâs a message of thanks to every single
person who has taken the time to share their story. When the death of Queen Elizabeth was
announced, we at the BBC wanted to create a place where people could come
together to share their tributes, their photos and recollections. The
response has been incredible. We have received thousands of touching stories of
meeting the Queen, special moments, memories and messages of condolence. Thank you to everyone - from all
over the world - for coming together here in this virtual space for very real
acts a of remembrance. Looking at the contributions, the
common theme that emerges is that the Queen had a way of making each person she
met feel like the most important person in that moment. Thank you again for helping us remember
a woman whose promise to serve her people was fulfilled through a life of duty,
which touched so many people. Over the past 10 days, we've been asking you to share your memories of seeing and meeting Queen Elizabeth II or to send in your personal tributes. Thousands of people have sent their own messages of condolence. ""The stories speak to how many people felt a personal connection to Her Majesty,"" says BBC Media and Arts Correspondent David Sillito. ""It reminds us that, while the official record of the life of the Queen will be a series of great moments of national pageantry, those were rare special occasions. ""Her life was much more about handshakes, birthday cards and meeting ordinary, but often remarkable, people. ""No-one forgets a conversation with the Queen. And our tributes page has been a little reminder that for hundreds of thousands of us, the Queen was more than a distant figure in a palace. She was someone with whom they felt a personal connection."" You can read more from David on the tributes here. Sibella Laing went to Cambridge University with King Charles III, has known the Royal Family since she was a child and has met the Queen. She was, is, and always has been, incredibly kind to everybody, always anxious to put people at their ease, always anxious to make you feel you are the only person in the room.  Iâm sure this huge support across the country that Charles must have been seeing will have been really inspirational and uplifting for him. He has had the Queen as a wonderful role model all his life and I think in a sense his whole life has been preparation for this, so I think he is ready for it."" Sibella Laing Dinkie Flowers in the queue to pay her respects to Queen Elizabeth II in Westminster Hall Dinkie Flowers (nee Stapleton), aged 101, queued for several hours on Saturday to pay her respects to Queen Elizabeth II. Dinkie, who lives in Shoreham-by-Sea is holding a letter she received from Buckingham Palace 70 years ago thanking her for her performance in the Celebrity Ice Show at Queens Ice Dance Club on 30 April 1952.

Marie came to Windsor for the Queen's funeral on Monday, watching the procession from the Long Walk. I was walking in Great Park and she drove her Land Rover further up. I was just gobsmacked.  We always felt that she belonged here. This was her home. I am glad that she is in Windsor now, this was her favourite place. She will be missed."" Marie Wood Frances came from Italy to leave a portrait of the Queen drawn by her son Alex I have been living in Italy for the last 22 years. My son, Alex (13) drew this portrait of the Queen and I asked him if he wanted me to take it to London so I could leave it as a tribute for the Queen. He said yes.  On Saturday I got on a plane from Verona to come especially to leave the portrait before the funeral. Yesterday I took the 5.20am train from Havant to London and I left his portrait in Green Park. The policemen were very kind to take it for me as the park had already closed for laying flowers.""

Bishop of Coventry, Reverend Christopher Cocksworth Zara Umar gave flowers to the Queen in 2002 My daughter Zara and I went down to the City Square in Dundee to see the Queen in 2002. We waited for a long time. Soon the time came and the Queen was walking towards us. She was about five or six steps away from us when one of her security personnel guided the Queen away to the car to leave. Zara was so disappointed and my heart sank. Just then a plain clothes man came and asked me if he could lift Zara over the barrier. Much to my delight, Zara presented the flowers to the Queen and said 'here you are then, take your flowers.' I couldnt believe it! The Queen must have found it funny though and watched Zara return to me with a big smile on her face. I will treasure this memory forever."" Ishrat Umar, Dundee Three army veterans from Worcestershire pay tribute to the Queen... She was our head, she was our leader, she was the person we were serving and she's the one that we would follow. It hits you, it hits your heart."" Eric Braithwaite, who served for 23 years with the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers Everyone called her the boss in one way or another. I've actually guarded the Queen and Prince Philip on other duties. A big lump in the throat, lost the boss, getting a new one."" Dave Sandy, who served in the territorial army from the late 1970s until the 1990s I've done a lot of parades for the Queen, she was a lovely lady and worked so hard for the country. I was in tears, I will be honest. It was an honour to be with her and be a soldier for her."" Anthony Goodway, who spent two years in national service from 1958 until 1960 I met the Queen when she visited the Isle of Skye as part of her Golden Jubilee tour. As a nurse then at the local care home, myself and other staff members were invited to bring some of our residents to meet Her Majesty. The great day came, our ladies looking beautiful, wheelchairs polished. One of our residents had worked at the palace as a younger woman and had photos of the Queen all around her room in the care home, so, if any one was to be there that day, it was her.  As the Queen approached our little group that day she asked me: âAre these the ladies from the care home?' I replied in the positive and then said this resident had worked in the palace. The Queen looked down a little and asked her: âWhen did you work at the palace?â To which, the lady looked up and and replied, in a rather gruff voice: âAnd who are you?â What a moment. I apologised. The Queen just smiled and moved on.  I was quite overwhelmed, I donât have photos of the Queen all over the house, but Iâve always respected her, especially as a Christian woman. She had a real true faith, so meeting her was very special. I didnât expect to be so overcome by the moment. Her demeanour was that of interest and she handled the situation really well. She left us all feeling very special and honoured. Barbara Matheson from Glasgow Barbara Matheson has recalled the moment she met the Queen during Her Majesty's Golden Jubilee tour Â© 2025 BBC.

Obituary: One constant in a changing world,"The long reign of Queen Elizabeth II was marked by her strong sense of duty and her determination to dedicate her life to her throne and to her people. She became for many the one constant point in a rapidly changing world as British influence declined, society changed beyond recognition and the role of the monarchy itself came into question. Her success in maintaining the monarchy through such turbulent times was even more remarkable given that, at the time of her birth, no-one could have foreseen that the throne would be her destiny. Elizabeth Alexandra Mary Windsor was born on 21 April 1926, in a house just off Berkeley Square in London, the first child of Albert, Duke of York, second son of George V, and his duchess, the former Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon. Baby Elizabeth with her parents at her christening Both Elizabeth and her sister, Margaret Rose, who was born in 1930, were educated at home and brought up in a loving family atmosphere. Elizabeth was extremely close to both her father and her grandfather, George V. At the age of six, Elizabeth told her riding instructor that she wanted to become a ""country lady with lots of horses and dogs"". She was said to have shown a remarkable sense of responsibility from a very early age. Winston Churchill, the future prime minister, was quoted as saying that she possessed ""an air of authority that was astonishing in an infant"". Despite not attending school, Elizabeth proved adept at languages and made a detailed study of constitutional history. A special Girl Guides company, the 1st Buckingham Palace, was formed so that she could socialise with girls of her own age. On the death of George V in 1936, his eldest son, known as David, became Edward VIII. However, his choice of wife, the twice-divorced American Wallis Simpson, was deemed to be unacceptable on political and religious grounds. At the end of the year he abdicated. Princess Elizabeth, with her parents and younger sister Margaret, at the time of her father's ""very, very wonderful"" Coronation Princesses Elizabeth (right) and Margaret broadcast to the nation in World War Two A reluctant Duke of York became King George VI. His Coronation gave Elizabeth a foretaste of what lay in store for her and she later wrote that she had found the service ""very, very wonderful"". Against a background of increasing tension in Europe, the new King, together with his wife, Queen Elizabeth, set out to restore public faith in the monarchy. Their example was not lost on their elder daughter. In 1939, the 13-year-old princess accompanied the King and Queen to the Royal Naval College at Dartmouth. Together with her sister Margaret, she was escorted by one of the cadets, her third cousin, Prince Philip of Greece. It was not the first time they had met, but it was the first time she took an interest in him. Prince Philip called on his royal relatives when on leave from the navy, and by 1944, when she was 18, Elizabeth was clearly in love with him. She kept his picture in her room and they exchanged letters. The young princess briefly joined the Auxiliary Territorial Service (ATS) towards the end of the war, learning to drive and service a lorry. On VE Day, she joined the Royal Family at Buckingham Palace as thousands gathered in The Mall to celebrate the end of the war in Europe. ""We asked my parents if we could go out and see for ourselves,"" she later recalled. ""I remember we were terrified of being recognised. I remember lines of unknown people linking arms and walking down Whitehall, all of us just swept along on a tide of happiness and relief."" After the war, her desire to marry Prince Philip faced a number of obstacles. The King was reluctant to lose a daughter on whom he doted, and Philip had to overcome the prejudice of an establishment that could not accept his foreign ancestry. Princess Elizabeth's wedding to Philip Mountbatten brightened the post-war gloom But the wishes of the couple prevailed and on 20 November 1947 the couple married in Westminster Abbey. The Duke of Edinburgh, as Philip had become, remained a serving naval officer. For a short time, a posting to Malta meant the young couple could enjoy a relatively normal life. Their first child, Charles, was born in 1948, followed by a sister, Anne, who arrived in 1950. But the King, having suffered considerable stress during the war years, was terminally ill with lung cancer, brought about by a lifetime of heavy smoking. In January 1952, Elizabeth, then 25, set off with Philip for an overseas tour. The King, against medical advice, went to the airport to see the couple off. It was to be the last time Elizabeth would see her father. Elizabeth heard of the death of the King while staying at a game lodge in Kenya and the new Queen immediately returned to London. ""In a way, I didn't have an apprenticeship,"" she later recalled. ""My father died much too young, so it was all a very sudden kind of taking on and making the best job you can."" Her Coronation in June 1953 was televised, despite the opposition of Prime Minister Winston Churchill, and millions gathered around TV sets, many of them for the first time, to watch as Queen Elizabeth II made her oath. With Britain still enduring post-war austerity, commentators saw the Coronation as the dawn of a new Elizabethan age. World War Two had served to hasten the end of the British Empire, and by the time the new Queen set off on a lengthy tour of the Commonwealth in November 1953, many former British possessions, including India, had gained independence. Her Coronation was the first to be broadcast live on British TV Elizabeth became the first reigning monarch to visit Australia and New Zealand. It was estimated that three-quarters of Australians turned out to see her in person. Throughout the 1950s, more countries hauled down the union flag and the former colonies and dominions now came together as a voluntary family of nations. Many politicians felt that the new Commonwealth could become a counter to the newly emerging European Economic Community and, to some extent, British policy turned away from the Continent. Her visit to the US in 1957 was just one of many overseas tours But the decline of British influence was hastened by the Suez debacle in 1956, when it became clear that the Commonwealth lacked the collective will to act together in times of crisis. The decision to send British troops to try to prevent Egypt's threatened nationalisation of the Suez Canal ended in an ignominious withdrawal and brought about the resignation of Prime Minister Anthony Eden. This embroiled the Queen in a political crisis. The Conservative Party had no mechanism for electing a new leader and, after a series of consultations, the Queen invited Harold Macmillan to form a new government. The Queen also found herself the subject of a personal attack by the writer Lord Altrincham. In a magazine article, he claimed her court was ""too British"" and ""upper-class"" and accused her of being unable to make a simple speech without a written text. His remarks caused a furore in the press and Lord Altrincham was physically attacked in the street by a member of the League of Empire Loyalists. Nevertheless, the incident demonstrated that British society and attitudes to the monarchy were changing fast and old certainties were being questioned. Encouraged by her husband, notoriously impatient with the court's stuffiness, the Queen began to adapt to the new order. The practice of receiving debutantes at court was abolished and the term ""the Monarchy"" was gradually replaced by ""the Royal Family"". The Queen was once more at the centre of a political row when in 1963, Harold Macmillan stood down as prime minister. With the Conservative Party still to set up a system for choosing a new leader, she followed his advice to appoint the Earl of Home in his place. It was a difficult time for the Queen. The hallmark of her reign was constitutional correctness, and a further separation of the monarchy from the government of the day. She took seriously her rights to be informed, to advise and to warn - but did not seek to step beyond them. It was to be the last time she would be put in such a position. The Conservatives finally did away with the tradition that new party leaders just ""emerged"", and a proper system was put in place. The documentary Royal Family gave an unprecedented look behind the public face of the monarchy By the late 1960s, Buckingham Palace had decided that it needed to take a positive step to show the Royal Family in a far less formal and more approachable way. The result was a ground-breaking documentary, Royal Family. The BBC was allowed to film the Windsors at home. There were pictures of the family at a barbecue, decorating the Christmas tree, taking their children for a drive - all ordinary activities, but never seen before. Critics claimed that Richard Cawston's film destroyed the mystique of the royals by showing them to be ordinary people, including scenes of the Duke of Edinburgh barbecuing sausages in the grounds at Balmoral. But the film echoed the more relaxed mood of the times and did much to restore public support for the monarchy. By 1977, the Silver Jubilee was celebrated with genuine enthusiasm in street parties and in ceremonies across the kingdom. The monarchy seemed secure in the public's affection and much of that was down to the Queen herself. Two years later, Britain had, in Margaret Thatcher, its first woman prime minister. Relations between the female head of state and female head of government were sometimes said to have been awkward. One difficult area was the Queen's devotion to the Commonwealth, of which she was head. The Queen knew the leaders of Africa well and was sympathetic to their cause. She was reported to have found Thatcher's attitude and confrontational style ""puzzling"", not least over the prime minister's opposition to sanctions against apartheid South Africa. Year by year, the Queen's public duties continued. After the Gulf War in 1991, she went to the United States to become the first British monarch to address a joint session of Congress. President George HW Bush said she had been ""freedom's friend for as long as we can remember"". The Windsor Castle fire contributed to the Queen's ""annus horribilis"" However, a year later, a series of scandals and disasters began to affect the Royal Family. The Queen's second son, the Duke of York, and his wife Sarah separated, while Princess Anne's marriage to Mark Phillips ended in divorce. Then the Prince and Princess of Wales were revealed to be deeply unhappy and eventually split up. The year culminated in a huge fire at the Queen's favourite residence, Windsor Castle. It seemed a grimly appropriate symbol of a royal house in trouble. It was not helped by a public row over whether the taxpayer, or the Queen, should foot the bill for the repairs. The Queen described 1992 as her ""annus horribilis"" and, in a speech in the City of London, appeared to concede the need for a more open monarchy in return for a less hostile media. ""No institution, city, monarchy, whatever, should expect to be free from the scrutiny of those who give it their loyalty and support, not to mention those who don't. But we are all part of the same fabric of our national society and that scrutiny can be just as effective if it is made with a measure of gentleness, good humour and understanding."" The institution of monarchy was very much on the defensive. Buckingham Palace was opened to visitors to raise money to pay for the repairs at Windsor and it was announced that the Queen and the Prince of Wales would pay tax on investment income. The Queen was committed to the Commonwealth throughout her reign Abroad, the hopes for the Commonwealth, so high early in her reign, had not been fulfilled. Britain had turned its back on its old partners with new arrangements in Europe. The Queen still saw value in the Commonwealth and was deeply gratified when South Africa, where she had come of age, at last threw apartheid aside. She celebrated with a visit in March 1995. At home, the Queen sought to maintain the dignity of the monarchy while public debate continued on whether the institution had any future. The Queen faced criticism after the death of Diana, Princess of Wales As Britain struggled to find a new destiny, she tried to remain a reassuring figure, and with a sudden smile could lighten a solemn moment. The role she valued above all was that of symbol of the nation. However, the monarchy was shaken and the Queen herself attracted unusual criticism after the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, in a car accident in Paris in August 1997. As the public crowded around the palaces in London with tributes of flowers, the Queen seemed reluctant to provide the focus that she had always tried to do during great national moments. Many of her critics failed to understand that she was from a generation that recoiled from the almost hysterical displays of public mourning that typified the aftermath of the princess's death. She also felt as a caring grandmother that she needed to comfort Diana's sons in the privacy of the family circle. Eventually, she made a live broadcast, paying tribute to her daughter-in-law and making a commitment that the monarchy would adapt. The deaths of the Queen Mother and Princess Margaret, in the Queen's Golden Jubilee year, 2002, cast a shadow over nationwide celebrations of her reign. But despite this, and the recurring debate over the future of the monarchy, a million people crowded into The Mall, in front of Buckingham Palace, on the evening of the jubilee. The wedding of Prince William to Catherine Middleton was a happy occasion In April 2006, thousands of well-wishers lined the streets of Windsor as the Queen performed an informal walkabout on her 80th birthday. And in November 2007, she and Prince Philip celebrated 60 years of marriage with a service attended by 2,000 people at Westminster Abbey. There was yet another happy occasion in April 2011 when the Queen attended the wedding of her grandson, William, Duke of Cambridge, to Catherine Middleton. In May that year she became the first British monarch to make an official visit to the Irish Republic, an event of great historical significance. In a speech, which she began in Irish, she called for forbearance and conciliation and referred to ""things we wish had been done differently or not at all"". A year later, on a visit to Northern Ireland as part of the Diamond Jubilee celebrations, she shook hands with the former IRA commander Martin McGuinness. It was a poignant moment for a monarch whose much-loved cousin, Lord Louis Mountbatten, had been killed by an IRA bomb in 1979. Her handshake with Martin McGuinness was a landmark moment The Diamond Jubilee brought hundreds of thousands of people on to the streets and culminated in a weekend of celebrations in London. The referendum on Scottish independence, in September 2014, was a testing time for the Queen. Few had forgotten her speech to Parliament in 1977 in which she made clear her commitment to a United Kingdom. ""I number kings and queens of England and of Scotland, and princes of Wales among my ancestors and so I can readily understand these aspirations. But I cannot forget that I was crowned Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland."" In a remark to well-wishers at Balmoral on the eve of the Scottish referendum, which was overheard, she said she hoped people would think very carefully about the future. Once the result of the vote was known, her public statement underlined the relief she felt that the Union was still intact, although recognising that the political landscape had changed. ""Now, as we move forward, we should remember that despite the range of views that have been expressed, we have in common an enduring love of Scotland, which is one of the things that helps to unite us all."" In later years the Queen withdrew from much of public life though she appeared on the balcony at Buckingham Palace for her Platinum Jubilee in 2022 On 9 September 2015 she became the longest reigning monarch in British history, surpassing the reign of her great-great-grandmother Queen Victoria. In typical style she refused to make any fuss saying the title was ""not one to which I have ever aspired"". Less than a year later, in April 2016, she celebrated her 90th birthday. She continued with her public duties, often alone after the retirement of the Duke of Edinburgh in 2017. There were continued strains on the family - including her husband's car accident, the Duke of York's ill-judged friendship with convicted American businessman Jeffrey Epstein and Prince Harry's growing disillusionment with life in the royal family. These were unsettling moments, presided over by a monarch who demonstrated that she was still firmly in control. There was also the death of Prince Philip in April 2021, in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, and her Platinum Jubilee a year later. Although the monarchy might not have been as strong at the end of the Queen's reign as it was at the start, she was determined that it should continue to command a place of affection and respect in the hearts of the British people. On the occasion of her Silver Jubilee, she recalled the pledge she had made on a visit to South Africa 30 years before. ""When I was 21, I pledged my life to the service of our people and I asked for God's help to make good that vow. Although that vow was made in my salad days, when I was green in judgement, I do not regret, or retract, one word of it."" The British Monarchy Â© 2025 BBC.

Heaton-Harris makes first visit as NI Secretary,"Chris Heaton-Harris is the MP for Daventry Sinn FÃ©in vice-president Michelle O'Neill said she told the new secretary of state that the absence of an executive in Northern Ireland was no longer tolerable. Ms O'Neill said the government needed to stop ""pandering"" to the DUP. DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said Sinn FÃ©in ""need to grow up"". After meeting Chris Heaton-Harris, Ms O'Neill accused the government of being ""in hock"" to the right-wing European Research Group (ERG). The new secretary of state also met DUP leaders on Thursday. However, he did not meet representatives of Alliance, the Ulster Unionist Party or the SDLP. Mr Heaton-Harris said he looked forward to meeting ""all political parties"" in the coming days. Speaking after meeting him in Dungannon, Ms O'Neill said: ""There must be a deal. We must find a way forward. ""We have a new prime minister and a new secretary of state but it's still the Tory party; different people at the helm but it's still the Tory party. ""My focus and I suppose my message to the new secretary of state this morning was very clear: 'It's get down to business; work with others, find an agreed way forward. ""'Bring that certainty and stability that is required. Get an executive up and running and stop pandering to the DUP."" Mr Heaton-Harris and the new minister of state at the Northern Ireland office, Steve Baker, are past chairmen of the pro-Brexit group ERG within the parliamentary Conservative Party. ""The ERG have been dictating the pace and bringing a very toxic influence to our local politics,"" Ms O'Neill said. Michelle O'Neill said she welcomed the secretary of state's ""warm words"" about the restoration of the executive being his priority, but added that that had not been the case with the Conservative party to date ""So, regardless of who's there, that's a feature. My concern is that I stand up for people here and the people want an executive up and running. ""They want us to put money into their pockets to help them get us through this nightmare of a cost-of-living crisis."" Sir Jeffrey said Mr Heaton-Harris and Mr Baker ""understand the difficulties we face at this time and the challenges we need to overcome"". ""I'm sure the secretary of state will share our view that decisive action needs to be taken to address those problems so that the political institutions can be restored here,"" the DUP leader said. He said his party was committed to helping the people of Northern Ireland, unlike Sinn FÃ©in who he said ""need to grow up."" He said there was a prospect of renewed negotiations but a ""change of stance by the European Union"" was required. ""When they talk about respecting the Belfast Agreement, that means, in article 1 of that agreement, respecting Northern Ireland's place in the United Kingdom - because that's what the people of Northern Ireland support."" Mr Heaton-Harris was in Dungannon for his first official visit to Northern Ireland.Heaton-Harris makes first visit as NI Secretary He was announced aspart of new Prime Minister Liz Truss's cabinet,following the sacking of Shailesh Vara. He was criticised for only holding meetings with Sinn FÃ©in and the DUP on the first day of his visit. However, UUP leader Doug Beattie will meet Mr Heaton-Harris on Tuesday. He said next week's meeting gave him time ""to go to him with our concerns and our proposals to get the executive up and running again"". Mr Heaton-Harris said he wanted to ""deliver enough pressure"" to get an executive restored and resolve the dispute over the Northern Ireland Protocol. In a statement, he said, ""It has been brilliant to be out and about in Northern Ireland today, and to talk to people about how we can deliver for the people of Northern Ireland."" Mr Heaton-Harris explained that the UK government was currently faced with a ""range of challenging issues"" including finding a solution to the Northern Ireland Protocol and the rising cost of living. Following the announcement by the prime minister of a energy support package he said he had been speaking to his Cabinet colleagues to ensure that support would be delivered in Northern Ireland ""as soon as possible."" At his first NI Questions on Wednesday Mr Heaton-Harris said the best way forward was to have a functioning executive. Ms Truss told the Commons the Northern Ireland Executive must return - and at the end of next month the new secretary of state will have to decide what to do if this does not happen. New secretary of state Chris Heaton-Harris speaks to the press in Dungannon If Stormont has not returned by 28 October, a 12-week period will be triggered during which he will have to call a fresh assembly election, unless the government instead chooses to push back the deadline. On Wednesday, Mr Heaton-Harris said he would ""work with everybody"" to resolve problems over the Northern Ireland Protocol. Brexit: What is the Northern Ireland Protocol? How does Northern Ireland's power-sharing government work? Read More: Who is Northern Ireland's new secretary of state? He also told the Commons that he wanted to negotiate a solution with the EU but that the UK government would legislate at Westminster if this did not happen. He called on the DUP to return to power sharing as soon as possible. But he is seen by some as an ally of the party because of his support for Brexit and his desire to change the protocol. Sinn FÃ©in's Conor Murphy, who met Mr Heaton-Harris alongside Ms O'Neill, earlier said he would encourage him to meet all Northern Ireland parties. He said: ""We will deal with any British secretary the way we've dealt with previous ones. British government policy in Ireland is the problem and particularly in relation to the protocol and other issues affecting Brexit. ""We need to see them back in proper negotiations with the EU so the benefits of the protocol can be felt here and we stop suffering the full effect of Brexit as is happening right across Britain at this moment."" DUP MP Sammy Wilson said the outcome of what Ms Truss's government does about the protocol was ""the most important thing"". ""Until that is dealt with, people will find that their cost of living goes up even more than the rest of the UK, due to additional costs which the protocol is imposing on goods coming into Northern Ireland,"" he said. ""The cost of living issues are not going to be dealt with by Stormont - Stormont doesn't have the money. ""It is going to come from Westminster so we'll be looking out for what's announced today in terms of energy help for people and then of course later on when the government brings its budget."" Meanwhile, SDLP MP Claire Hanna has described the appointments of Mr Heaton-Harris and Mr Baker as ""concerning"". ""It is fair to say Liz Truss has appointed two men known for being very much associated with having a very hardline Brexit view and they're former chairs of the ERG (European Research Group),"" she said. ""I would suggest it is that ERG ideology that has got Northern Ireland into the place we're in. Six years of not properly acknowledging, understanding and processing the realities of Brexit with the geography we have. ""We do think it is a concerning appointment - there are optimistic interpretations that she's sending a hardliner in to look tough and to do the deal but at the moment it doesn't send a good signal about her willingness to work with people who do not support a hardline Brexit and to work with the EU,"" she added.

He was created the Duke of York on his marriage to Sarah Ferguson, who became Duchess of York, in 1986. They had two daughters - Beatrice, in 1988, and Eugenie, in 1990. In March 1992 it was announced the duke and duchess were to separate. They divorced in 1996. The duke served for 22 years in the Royal Navy and saw active service in the Falklands War in 1982. In addition to royal engagements, he served as a special trade representative for the government until 2011. Prince Andrew stepped away from royal duties in 2019 after an interview with the BBC about his relationship with US financier Jeffrey Epstein, who killed himself while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking and conspiracy charges. In February 2022, the dukeagreed to pay an undisclosed sum to settle a civil sexual assault case brought against himin the US by one of Epstein's victims, although he made no admission of liability and had repeatedly denied the allegations.

Born: 1964 Prince Edward was given the title Duke of Edinburgh on his 59th birthday, almost two years after the death of his father Prince Philip, who previously held the title. It was understood that Philip had wanted Edward to take on the title, but the decision was left to King Charles. Prince Edward's wife Sophie becomes the Duchess of Edinburgh and the prince's former title, the Earl of Wessex, has now been given to his son James, Viscount Severn. The couple also have a daughter, Lady Louise, born in 2003. After a brief period with the Royal Marines, the prince formed his own TV production company. He subsequently supported the late queen in her official duties and carried out public engagements for charities. He is14th in line to the throne. Born: 2007 James, Earl of Wessex is the younger child of the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh. He was given the title after his father Prince Edward became the Duke of Edinburgh in March 2023. When James was born, he was given the title Viscount Severn - a ""courtesy"" title as son of an earl, rather than using prince. It is thought his parents made this decision to avoid some of the burdens of royal titles. Born: 2003 Born in 2003, Lady Louise Windsor is the elder child of the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh. However, she is lower in the line of succession than her younger brother because she was born before a law came into force scrapping the system that meant a younger son could displace an older daughter.

The moment Buckingham Palace crowds learned the news,"This video can not be played Crowds sing God save the Queen outside Buckingham Palace As the union jack at Buckingham Palace was lowered to half mast, the crowds outside stood still in shock.

The Queen had died. People had gathered throughout the afternoon after hearing she was ill. The gravity of the moment was all over 77-year-old Sheila De Bellaigue's teary face. ""I didn't realise until I saw the flag lower,"" she said, ""and then I knew. I'm feeling very sad, as is everybody who is here."" The Londoner remembers getting her coronation mug as a schoolgirl. ""She's been a wonderful queen, and she'll be very much missed."" Also watching the flag being lowered was Michael Hammond, 23, from Southampton.

It was not long before a sea of people came through Green Park and over the road to the palace, forcing traffic to stop.

""It's going to be a shockwave,"" she said, ""and there will be ripples for days and days."" The pavement outside the palace gates filled with young and old, Brits and tourists. Some stood alone, in silence, in the rain. Others gathered under umbrellas with their friends. Dave Baldwin was at the gym when the news alert pinged to his phone. He jumped on a bike and headed for the palace from Oxford Street, around a mile away. ""It's quite sombre isn't it - at the same time we kind of knew it was coming,"" he said. ""But it's nice to see people turn out and giving flowers. I'm sure it's just the start of people coming and showing their appreciation.""

She was the first child of Albert, Duke of York - the second son of George V - and his wife, the former Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon In her early years, the throne was not her destiny However, she was said to have shown a sense of responsibility from a very young age Both Elizabeth and her sister, Margaret Rose, who was born in 1930, were educated at home Following the abdication of King Edward VIII in 1936, Elizabeth's father became King George VI and she became heir During World War Two, Elizabeth and her sister Margaret were evacuated to Windsor.

Some strike action cancelled after the Queen's deathStrike action by postal workers and RMT train staff has been cancelled following the death of the Queen.,"Some of the UK's biggest strikes have been called off after the death of Queen Elizabeth II. Unions representing Royal Mail postal workers and rail staff said that ""out of respect for her service to the country and her family"" they had chosen to cancel immediate strike action. Queen Elizabeth II, the UK's longest-serving monarch, died at Balmoral aged 96, after reigning for 70 years. Some shops have announced temporary closures as a mark of respect. The planned strike action by postal workers on Friday 9 September and RMT rail worker walkouts on 15 and 17 September has been suspended. The train drivers' union Aslef has also postponed a strike planned for 15 September. The Rail Delivery Group said train timetables would be normal now that strikes were not going ahead. A spokesperson from the Rail Delivery Group, which represents train operators, said it welcomed the decision by the RMT to call off next week's strike action at a time of ""national mourning"". ""The whole railway family is united in sending our condolences to the Royal Family,"" the spokesperson said. Network Rail has confirmed that train services will run as normal next week. It will also look at any scheduled weekend engineering works that fall within the ""laying in state period"" and scale it back. Works might be postponed if they prevent people from travelling to London to pay their respects. Obituary: A long life marked by a sense of duty Queen Elizabeth II: A life in pictures This is the moment history stops King Charles III, the new monarch The RMT union intends to reschedule the strikes, but has not yet decided when. It would need to give two weeks' notice of any action, as would the Aslef union. RMT general secretary Mick Lynch said that his union joined the ""whole nation in paying its respects"" to Queen Elizabeth. ""We express our deepest condolences to her family, friends and the country,"" he added. Train drivers' union Aslef said: ""In light of the sad news of Queen Elizabeth II's death, Aslef is postponing its industrial action on 15 September. We express our deepest condolences to her family, friends and the country."" The TSSA rail union has also cancelled planned industrial action for September and said it would be ""respecting the period of public mourning"". The Trades Unions Congress said it would postpone its annual congress until later this autumn following the death of the Queen. A spokesman said it was ""as a mark of respect"" and recognised ""her many years of dedicated service to the country"". Staff in the CWU, which represents postal workers, had been on strike on Thursday. But the union cancelled Friday's planned walkout after the Queen's death was announced. CWU general secretary Dave Ward said the action had been cancelled, ""following the very sad news of the passing of the Queen, and out of respect for her service to the country and her family"". Workers across a range of industries including BT call centre staff, Openreach engineers, railway workers and barristers have walked out in recent weeks in pay disputes as wages fail to keep up with soaring prices. The Criminal Bar Association said that planned barristers' demonstrations next week had been cancelled ""out of respect"". But it added that there had been ""no movement"" from the government so industrial action would continue. Shops such as Selfridge's, which was granted a royal warrant in 2001, closed early on Thursday and it said it would remain shut on Friday before reopening this weekend. Toy store chain The Entertainer will also be closed on Friday and offered its ""sincere condolences"" to the Royal Family. Betting shops Betfred and William Hill have said they will close on Friday. Tourist attraction Legoland Windsor is also closed on Friday. The theme park said those who were due to visit would receive an email about their booking.
