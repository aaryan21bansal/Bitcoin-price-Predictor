"Pope: God still loves us all, even the worst of us","Pope Francis last week introduced sweeping changes to remove the rule of ""pontifical secrecy"" Pope Francis has ushered in Christmas by saying God loves everyone - ""even the worst of us"". He was speaking to thousands of people during Christmas Eve Mass in St Peter's Basilica at the Vatican. ""You may have mistaken ideas, you may have made a complete mess of things... but the Lord continues to love you,"" the Argentine pontiff said. This will be interpreted by some as a reference to Church scandals, including sex abuse, our correspondent says. Church abuse scandal: What you need to know Archbishop of Canterbury to reflect on attack in sermon In pictures: Christmas around the world Pope Francis will return to St Peter's Basilica later on Christmas Day to deliver the traditional papal message to the world. Among those taking part in the Mass were children chosen from countries including Venezuela, Iraq and Uganda. The BBC's Rome correspondent Mark Lowen says this is a clear gesture from the leader of 1.3 billion Catholics who often focuses on the plight of migrants and victims of war, as well as on extending the reach of the Church to its periphery. ""Christmas reminds us that God continues to love us all, even the worst of us. To me, to you, to each of us, he says today: 'I love you and I will always love you, for you are precious in my eyes,'"" the 83-year-old pontiff said. ""God does not love you because you think and act the right way. He loves you, plain and simple. His love is unconditional; it does not depend on you."" And the Pope also alluded to the clerical abuse and financial scandals afflicting the Church. ""Whatever goes wrong in our lives, whatever doesn't work in the Church, whatever problems there are in the world, will no longer serve as an excuse."" From Australian country towns to schools in Ireland and cities across the US, the Catholic Church has faced a catalogue of child sexual abuse accusations in the past few decades. High-profile cases and harrowing testimony given to public inquiries have continued to keep the issue in the headlines. This video can not be played George Pell is the most senior Catholic cleric to be convicted of such crimes In the most recent of these,Cardinal George Pell was convicted of abusing two choir boys in Melbourne in 1996. He is Australia's highest-ranking Catholic, and was previously Vatican treasurer - meaning he was widely seen as the Church's third most powerful official. Last week, the Pope introduced sweeping changes to remove the rule of ""pontifical secrecy"" that has pervaded the issue of clerical child abuse. The Church previously shrouded sexual abuse cases in secrecy, in what it said was an effort to protect the privacy of victims and reputations of the accused. But new papal documents lifted restrictions on those who report abuse or say they have been victims. The Pope also changed the Vatican's definition of child pornography, increasing the age of the subject from 14 or under to 18 or under. Pope Francis has faced serious pressure to provide leadership and generate workable solutions to the crisis, which has engulfed the Church in recent years.

He was created the Duke of York on his marriage to Sarah Ferguson, who became Duchess of York, in 1986. They had two daughters - Beatrice, in 1988, and Eugenie, in 1990. In March 1992 it was announced the duke and duchess were to separate. They divorced in 1996. The duke served for 22 years in the Royal Navy and saw active service in the Falklands War in 1982. In addition to royal engagements, he served as a special trade representative for the government until 2011.

Ernest is13th in line to the throne, moving the Duke of Edinburgh down to 14th place. Born: 1964 Prince Edward was given the title Duke of Edinburgh on his 59th birthday, almost two years after the death of his father Prince Philip, who previously held the title. It was understood that Philip had wanted Edward to take on the title, but the decision was left to King Charles. Prince Edward's wife Sophie becomes the Duchess of Edinburgh and the prince's former title, the Earl of Wessex, has now been given to his son James, Viscount Severn. The couple also have a daughter, Lady Louise, born in 2003. After a brief period with the Royal Marines, the prince formed his own TV production company. He subsequently supported the late queen in her official duties and carried out public engagements for charities. He is14th in line to the throne. Born: 2007 James, Earl of Wessex is the younger child of the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh. He was given the title after his father Prince Edward became the Duke of Edinburgh in March 2023. When James was born, he was given the title Viscount Severn - a ""courtesy"" title as son of an earl, rather than using prince. It is thought his parents made this decision to avoid some of the burdens of royal titles. Born: 2003 Born in 2003, Lady Louise Windsor is the elder child of the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh. However, she is lower in the line of succession than her younger brother because she was born before a law came into force scrapping the system that meant a younger son could displace an older daughter.

She was given the title Princess Royal in June 1987.

The princess was the first royal to use the surname Mountbatten-Windsor in an official document, in the marriage register after her wedding to Capt Phillips. She competed in equestrian events for Great Britain in the 1976 Montreal Olympics and is involved with a number of charities, including Save the Children, of which she has been president since 1970. Born: 1977 Peter Phillips is the eldest of the late queen's grandchildren. He married Canadian Autumn Kelly in 2008 and together they have two daughters, Savannah, born in 2010, and Isla, born in 2012. The children of the Princess Royal do not have royal titles, as they are descended from the female line. Mark Phillips refused the offer of an earldom when he married so their children do not have courtesy titles. Peter Phillips and his wife announced they were getting divorced in February 2020. Born: 2010 Savannah, born in 2010, is the elder daughter of Peter Phillips and Autumn Kelly and was the late queen's first great-grandchild. Born: 2012 Isla, born in 2012, is the second daughter of Peter Phillips and Autumn Kelly.

The 25-year-old also revealed he is to tour the US and his home nation between May and September. The singer announced as well he is to appear in a new documentary TV series. Bieber took an extended break from music in 2017 after cancelling the last 14 dates of his Purpose World Tour. Yet this year saw him appear as a guest vocalist on Ed Sheeran's I Don't Care and a remix of Billie Eilish's Bad Guy. This - together with an appearance with Ariana Grande at Coachella in April - led to speculation that he might be about to return with new solo material. Allow YouTube content?

Woman sues hospital for refusing to freeze eggs,"Teresa Xu said she felt she was representing many other single women too A woman in China is suing a hospital after doctors refused to freeze her eggs because she is unmarried, in line with a law on assisted reproduction. Teresa Xu visited Beijing Obstetrics and Gynaecology Hospital last year with the aim of freezing her eggs while she focused on her career. The freelance editor, 31, said hospital staff had urged her to have a child instead of freezing her eggs. She said she had been told later she could not proceed with treatment. ""I came here for a professional service, but instead I got someone who was urging me to put aside my work and have a child first,"" Ms Xu told Reuters news agency. Chao Wei, a spokesman for the hospital, saidthe facility was complying with government regulations,externalon assisted reproductive technologies, the New York Times reported. China is getting smarter - but at what cost? Freezing your eggs to enjoy life in China On Monday, a court in Beijing heard Ms Xu's lawsuit against the hospital. The case, which is expected to go on for several months, has been widely discussed on Chinese social media, where many have voiced support for Ms Xu. Speaking after her hearing, Ms Xu said: ""For me I didn't feel like I was at court as an individual. I felt I was standing there with the weight of many other single women's expectations."" A woman's eggs deteriorate in quality as she ages, making it more difficult for older women to have a child. There is a high demand for egg freezing in China, while women who can afford to tend to travel overseas for the treatment. In 2013, popular Chinese actress Xu Jinglei announced that she had frozen nine of her eggs. She travelled to the US at the age of 39 for the treatment. Ms Xu said she had considered going abroad but it was too expensive. She said she had been quoted prices of 100,000 yuan (Â£11,016) for the treatment in Thailand and 200,000 yuan (Â£22,032) in the US. Many users of China's social media site Weibo voiced their support for Ms Xu using a hashtag that translates as ""China's first unmarried frozen egg case"". One person wrote: ""Fertility should not be the sole value of women. Apart from being a mother, you are first and foremost an independent person."" Another said: ""If Chinese law changes, make sperm banks open to unmarried women! The population problem can be solved a little bit. There are still many people who don't want to get married and want to have a baby."" Chinese women's bodies have been subjected to stringent strict control by the state since a birth control policy was introduced in the 1970s. China replaced its one-child policy with a universal two-child policy in 2015, but there are still significant restrictions on fertility treatments and unmarried women are still not allowed to freeze their eggs. Some Weibo users asked why the woman was suing the hospital. ""I don't think there is any problem in the hospital's affairs and work. The parties should not sue the hospital but the State Family Planning Association,"" one person said.

Bloomberg says his campaign used prison labour,"Mr Bloomberg said his campaign had terminated its relationship with a firm which operated call centres in two US jails US presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg has said that his campaign ""unknowingly"" used prison workers to call voters on his behalf. The billionaire Democrat said he had cut ties with a vendor which operates two call centres in state jails. Mr Bloomberg said he learned about the company's use of prison labour only after receiving a call from a reporter. He entered the election race in November with one of the largest-ever political ad buys. His campaign's use of prison labourwas first reported by news site The Intercept,external, and confirmed by Mr Bloomberg in a statement on Tuesday. ""We do not support this practice and we are making sure our vendors more properly vet their subcontractors moving forward,"" said the former New York mayor. According to The Intercept, Mr Bloomberg - using a third-party vendor - hired call centre company ProCom to make phone calls for his campaign. How  Bloomberg could shake up 2020 race The key issues for 2020 Democrats The firm operates two centres in Oklahoma state prisons. An unidentified source told The Intercept that incarcerated people were contracted to make calls from at least one of these prisons - a minimum-security women's prison with a capacity of over 900 inmates. Matt Elliott, a spokesman for the Oklahoma Department of Corrections, told CBS News that inmates could earn $1.45 (Â£1.12) an hour working for call centres. ""We believe this type of work helps prepare inmates for release,"" he said. In a tweet Stu Loeser, Mr Bloomberg's long-time spokesman, said the campaign ""didn't know"" that ""a vendor of a vendor of a vendor used prison labour"". Allow Twitter content?

Before setting up a mass media empire, Mr Bloomberg made his billions from data terminals widely used in the financial industry. His net worth is $52bn (Â£40bn), according to Forbes - 17 times higher than Donald Trump. Since joining the presidential race, he has spent $59m (Â£45m) on advertising and recent polls show he has support from 5% of Democratic voters. Former Vice President Joe Biden, Senator Bernie Sanders and Senator Elizabeth Warren are currently leading the race for the party's nomination. The US has the highest incarceration rate in the world - far above other comparable industrialised nations While America's constitution outlaws slavery, the Thirteenth Amendment allows prisoners to be forced into labour for their crimes. Some labour is voluntary, while some is involuntary and non-compliance can be punished. In the past, many private firms have used so-called ""prison in-sourcing"" as an alternative to cheap labour in foreign countries. Inmates have been used for a variety of tasks like packaging Starbucks coffee and manufacturing lingerie. Prisoners were also paid $1 a day to battle wildfires in California last year. Supporters argue that the practice boosts local economies and helps to lower reconvictions by providing inmates with skills and income. But critics argue that prison labour is exploitative and prioritises private-sector profits over the rehabilitation of inmates. In 2018, incarcerated men and women took part in peaceful prison strikes across 17 US states to draw attention to jail conditions. As part of their demands, organisers called for an end to ""prison slavery"" by paying inmates proper wages. Suspected strike leaders were later punished with solitary confinement and the removal of their communication privileges.

Tributes paid to double murder victims,"Floral tributes to ""Sandy"" and ""Amy"" have been left outside the house where the women were killed Tributes have been paid to two women murdered outside a house in a West Sussex village. The victims were found dead in Hazel Way, Crawley Down, on Sunday morning. One woman, aged 76, has been named locally as Sandy Seagrave. Floral tributes have also been left at the scene to a woman called Amy. A 37-year-old man arrested on suspicion of murder is in a ""very unstable condition"" in hospital, after he was found injured inside the property. A double murder investigation was launched after the discovery of the dead women, one of whom was known to the suspect, Sussex Police said. The force confirmed a 76-year-old woman and a 32-year-old woman had died. Among the flowers left at the scene was a handwritten card dedicated to ""Amy"" A marked police car and uniformed officers were outside the house on Christmas Eve, as people laid flowers and paid their respects.

Woman sues hospital for 'refusing to freeze eggs',"Teresa Xu said she felt she was representing many other single women too A woman in China is suing a hospital after doctors refused to freeze her eggs because she is unmarried, in line with a law on assisted reproduction. Teresa Xu visited Beijing Obstetrics and Gynaecology Hospital last year with the aim of freezing her eggs while she focused on her career. The freelance editor, 31, said hospital staff had urged her to have a child instead of freezing her eggs. She said she had been told later she could not proceed with treatment. ""I came here for a professional service, but instead I got someone who was urging me to put aside my work and have a child first,"" Ms Xu told Reuters news agency. Chao Wei, a spokesman for the hospital, saidthe facility was complying with government regulations,externalon assisted reproductive technologies, the New York Times reported. China is getting smarter - but at what cost? Freezing your eggs to enjoy life in China On Monday, a court in Beijing heard Ms Xu's lawsuit against the hospital. The case, which is expected to go on for several months, has been widely discussed on Chinese social media, where many have voiced support for Ms Xu. Speaking after her hearing, Ms Xu said: ""For me I didn't feel like I was at court as an individual. I felt I was standing there with the weight of many other single women's expectations."" A woman's eggs deteriorate in quality as she ages, making it more difficult for older women to have a child. There is a high demand for egg freezing in China, while women who can afford to tend to travel overseas for the treatment. In 2013, popular Chinese actress Xu Jinglei announced that she had frozen nine of her eggs. She travelled to the US at the age of 39 for the treatment. Ms Xu said she had considered going abroad but it was too expensive. She said she had been quoted prices of 100,000 yuan (Â£11,016) for the treatment in Thailand and 200,000 yuan (Â£22,032) in the US. Many users of China's social media site Weibo voiced their support for Ms Xu using a hashtag that translates as ""China's first unmarried frozen egg case"". One person wrote: ""Fertility should not be the sole value of women. Apart from being a mother, you are first and foremost an independent person."" Another said: ""If Chinese law changes, make sperm banks open to unmarried women! The population problem can be solved a little bit. There are still many people who don't want to get married and want to have a baby."" Chinese women's bodies have been subjected to stringent strict control by the state since a birth control policy was introduced in the 1970s. China replaced its one-child policy with a universal two-child policy in 2015, but there are still significant restrictions on fertility treatments and unmarried women are still not allowed to freeze their eggs. Some Weibo users asked why the woman was suing the hospital. ""I don't think there is any problem in the hospital's affairs and work. The parties should not sue the hospital but the State Family Planning Association,"" one person said.

Girl's cancer treatment 'best Christmas present',"This video can not be played Jack Savoretti offers help to girl with cancer A girl's Christmas wish to receive a new cancer treatment has been granted after an anonymous donor helped her campaign reach its funding target. Anna Drysdale, eight, was diagnosed with osteosarcoma, a rare form of bone cancer, when she was five years old. Her family launched a crowdfunding page four months ago to pay for immunotherapy treatment in New York to prevent the cancer returning. Their Â£460,000 target was reached after ""an incredible anonymous donation"". Anna's mother Keeley, from Chipping Norton in Oxfordshire, said the family ""just couldn't believe it"" when they heard of the funding. ""We wondered, is it true? Is it really happening? It's definitely the best Christmas present we could ever have wished for,"" she added. Anna Drysdale will travel across the Atlantic for treatment in the new year Anna's campaign hit the headlines when Oxfordshire-based singer Jack Savoretti backed her campaign. Other stars, including Lewis Capaldi, Ricky Astley, Jo Whiley and Olly Murs also gave their support. Anna was first diagnosed in February 2017 and is currently in remission for a second time. Her family said the risk of the cancer returning was ""extremely high and very likely"", which is why they started their campaign for her to get new preventative treatment, which costs $500,000 (Â£386,600), at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. Anna will head to New York for the treatment in the new year. Jack Savoretti backs campaign for girl with cancer.

Thousands of UK troops to spend Christmas overseas,"Around 11,000 troops are serving on operations in countries including Iraq and Afghanistan Thousands of UK troops will spend Christmas away from home in more than 30 countries this year. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace praised the ""selflessness"" of the armed forces personnel and their families. Around 11,000 Army, Royal Navy and Royal Air Force personnel are serving on 35 overseas operations in countries including Iraq and Afghanistan. The troops have already begun sending messages to loved ones, the Ministry of Defence said. PM serves Christmas lunch to British troops Armed forces 'must cut cloth to match ambition' More than 1,000 personnel are stationed in the Falkland Islands in the South Atlantic, while in the Caribbean the air force remains on alert over the hurricane season, the MoD added. The Royal Navy will have 14 ships at sea on Christmas Day, including HMS Defender, which was used toseize Â£3.3m of crystal meth in the Arabian Sea on Monday. ""Over the festive period we should all take a moment to be grateful for the selflessness of our armed forces personnel and their families,"" Mr Wallace said. ""This Christmas, like any other day, our servicemen and women will be displaying their unique professionalism around the world and at home."" Mr Wallace, who was an officer in the Scots Guards before entering politics, said he knew what it was like to work away from home over Christmas and New Year. Meanwhile, the MoD has donated more than 14,000 unused ration packs to food waste charity FareShare, which will distribute the packages to charities running homeless outreach programmes in London over the Christmas period. The packages do not need to be refrigerated and include ingredients for breakfasts, lunches and dinners such as porridge, sausages, pasta and baked beans. On Thursday, the defence secretary confirmed that there was ashortfall of funding in the MoD's budget. The armed forces were given an extra Â£2.2bn in September's spending review when the chancellor announced a 2.6% increase in defence funding in 2020-21. But a defence spending squeeze between 2010 and 2015 has prompted questions about whether the UK is equipped to meet future security threats.

Addicts' deaths highlight Scotland's drugs crisisFigures seen by BBC Scotland suggest 2019 could be another record year for drugs deaths.Scotland,"Craig Wylie (left) died in July, a week after Scotland recorded its highest ever number of drug-related deaths Police have recorded 388 drug deaths in Scotland in the first six months of 2019 and a further 296 deaths are being investigated as drug-related, according to figures seen by the BBC. Last year's annual statistics were the highest since records began, with 1,187 fatalities in 2018. The rise prompted parliamentary inquiries and action by the Scottish government. Scotland has highest drug death rate in EU 'I lost my whole family to drugs' The data for 2019 is held by Police Scotland and if the cases being investigated are confirmed as drug deaths it would take the half-year total to 684 - higher than the same period last year. Earlier this year,BBC Scotland's The Nine programmerevealedthe trend in online drug purchases in one community. It has now returned to Dumfries and Galloway to tell the story of one rural addict and his partner. Craig and his partner Teressa (centre) were both addicts who bought pills online Craig Wyllie was a long-term drug user who lived in Langholm, the picturesque community where he was known locally for being an addict. The 36-year-old started using drugs in his teens. He was overweight, was addicted to benzodiazepine tablets such as fake Xanax and was a heavy drinker. His fiancÃ©e - or soul-mate, as described by a friend - was Teressa, who lived in nearby Canonbie. She was also addicted to various drugs and suffered severe epilepsy. She was 39. Watch The Nine's report from Langholm By this summer, the couple - well-known for their public arguments on the village bus - were dead. Like many users in the area, they had been ordering pills over the internet - diazepam, nitrazepam and fake batches of Xanax, a brand name for alprazolam. Craig was known as a long-term drug user in his local community of Langholm in Dumfries and Galloway Craig's father David told The Nine: ""He just said there were these blue tablets. ""It was only in the last few months that I knew he was ordering tablets over the internet. ""But he wouldn't say exactly what they were. I later found out from one of his friends that it was Xanax. ""I said to him, 'Craig, you've got to come off this stuff.' ""He said, 'Dad, I am trying, I am trying...Trust me, I know what I am doing.' ""But I guess he never."" Craig's brother Stewart raised concerns about the support services he was able to access Craig had been seeking help for his addiction and mental health issues from his local NHS. However, he had complained about the services that were provided. The Nine has seen a chain of emails between his brother Stewart, who lives in Canada, and local NHS staff sent from late 2017 until early 2019. In the emails, Stewart complained of his brother's care, including claims he had been turned away from psychiatric services due to a drink problem. But Craig was also missing appointments as he struggled with money and his drug use. Stewart told the BBC: ""His basic needs weren't being met. He wasn't working. There were days where he couldn't pay for his electricity, days where he couldn't even afford to buy food. He had his ongoing issues at home. ""But then to be expected to travel to take two, three separate buses to get to these appointments, it is just unacceptable."" NHS Dumfries and Galloway would not comment on an individual case. A spokesman said: ""A recognition that 40% non-attendance for first assessments was unsustainable resulted in measures introduced in January 2019 which have seen this non-attendance rate for first assessments fall to 30%."" Craig and Teressa were described as ""soul mates"" by a friend Craig had a turbulent relationship with Teressa. A friend and neighbour of Teressa and Craig, who did not want to be named, said that despite the fights and fall-outs, the two were often inseparable. ""Craig and Teressa always got back together,"" she said. ""It was up-and-down but they loved each other an incredible amount."" However, asked it she thought the couple's relationship would have survived without the presence of drugs or alcohol, she said: ""We won't know otherwise because they were never off drugs to find that answer out."" On 31 January this year, Craig was arrested at Teressa's home after he caused a disturbance and cut himself with a knife. He was remanded before special bail conditions meant the couple would be separated until a trial later in the year. Craig was well-known to police. He had a lengthy criminal history for drugs, assault and careless driving. A day before he was sentenced to a community payback order for the January incident, Craig was caught in Gretna carrying four different types of street tablets. He wasn't charged. However, by that time, it was already too late to return to Teressa. After failing to show up for her methadone subscription, she was found dead in her home on 15 March. Her cause of death is still listed as ""unascertained"". Craig's father David said: ""Craig was devastated. He blamed himself for not being there."" Craig's father, David Wylie, says the family had to wait 18 weeks to find out what killed his son According to his friends and family, Craig couldn't recover from his partner's death. In a letter to his brother, he wrote about his addiction to pills: ""I know I've not helped a bit but something has made me so bad on them, to make me drink and take so much without touching the sides."" He died in his Langholm home on 23 July 2019 - exactly a week after Scotland recorded its highest-ever number of drug-related deaths. Drug deaths taskforce meets for first time Scotland's drug death crisis in six charts What can be done about Scotland's drugs crisis? Despite Crown Office advice that post mortem examination results would be available between six and eight weeks after a death, the family waited 18 weeks to find out exactly what killed him. David received a letter from the Crown Office apologising for the delay, referencing ""detailed negotiations"" between it and the University of Glasgow for pathology services. Eventually, the results confirmed Craig had consumed nitrazepam, diazepam, cannabis and - the drug that ultimately killed him - heroin. Last week, the Crown Office confirmed it was investing an additional Â£300,000 in toxicology services at Glasgow University, which deals with the bulk of Scotland's drug death case. It said the money would ""help clear overdue post-mortem results that are impacting on a large number of bereaved families"". However, it added that a ""long term solution for future delivery"" was being sought from alternative providers as the Glasgow University contract ends next year. The Scottish government has called for greater powers over drug policy to help tackle the problem north of the border.

Salmon producer steps up war on food fraud,"Loch Duart co-founder Andy Bing said he had to take action to protect his company's brand A high-end Scottish salmon producer is taking on the illegal food fraud trade with forensic science, ahead of a big push into the US. Loch Duart has used the technology to launch sting operations on outlets suspected of selling inferior fish, falsely bearing the company's brand. The Sutherland-based firm says it prides itself on farming salmon in an ethical and sustainable way. Food fraudis estimated to cost UK firms up to Â£12bn a year. The practice of intentionally mislabelling cheap products as premium brandsled to the 2013 horsemeat scandal, and hasalso hit the olive oil and coffee industries. Unique markers Andy Bing, who co-founded Loch Duart 20 years ago, said: ""It's illegal, but people are very rarely caught. We want to change that."" He told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme: ""It normally happens in big cities where you get less scrupulous fish wholesalers who will go to a high-end restaurant, say they've got Loch Duart salmon, but they're selling something from a cheaper provenance and invoicing it as Loch Duart salmon."" Mr Bing said his company now exported its fish to 20 countries and protecting the brand was vital, given its ethos of farming salmon on a smaller, greener scale, using more expensive fish feed. Loch Duart teamed up with New Zealand-based firm Oritain, which uses science to find out exactly where products come from. ""Nature gives everything specific markers that is unique to its origin,"" said Mr Bing, who has been in the salmon business for 30 years. ""This technology can take trace elements from the loch in which it's farmed. You have a bank of information and you can match our salmon taken from any market in the world to that bank, and work out whether it's ours."" The technology used to spot fake products is based on forensic science Mr Bing added: ""We've tried to do a couple of stings. We've been led to somewhere by a loyal customer who says, 'I think I've been delivered something which is not the real deal'. ""We've gone down there with our sample bags and tried to apprehend them. ""We've been doing several checks in the south of England over the last few months. A couple of restaurants refused to give us samples. You can draw your own conclusions from that."" Mr Bing said the science, which requires 100 grams of uncooked salmon for a test to be carried out, could be used as evidence in a court case. And he said the science could be used across the food and drink industry. ""Next year we're gong to make a push into America where our brand's very strong, and we're taking this technology with us,"" said Mr Bing. He added: ""We're heavily export-orientated, but we've got to get through Brexit. ""We've got to get the right trade deal, but we believe people want our salmon, they want Scottish whisky and, on a trade level, we'll find a way.""

Addicts' deaths highlight Scotland's drugs crisis,"Craig Wylie (left) died in July, a week after Scotland recorded its highest ever number of drug-related deaths Police have recorded 388 drug deaths in Scotland in the first six months of 2019 and a further 296 deaths are being investigated as drug-related, according to figures seen by the BBC. Last year's annual statistics were the highest since records began, with 1,187 fatalities in 2018. The rise prompted parliamentary inquiries and action by the Scottish government. Scotland has highest drug death rate in EU 'I lost my whole family to drugs' The data for 2019 is held by Police Scotland and if the cases being investigated are confirmed as drug deaths it would take the half-year total to 684 - higher than the same period last year. Earlier this year,BBC Scotland's The Nine programmerevealedthe trend in online drug purchases in one community. It has now returned to Dumfries and Galloway to tell the story of one rural addict and his partner. Craig and his partner Teressa (centre) were both addicts who bought pills online Craig Wyllie was a long-term drug user who lived in Langholm, the picturesque community where he was known locally for being an addict. The 36-year-old started using drugs in his teens. He was overweight, was addicted to benzodiazepine tablets such as fake Xanax and was a heavy drinker. His fiancÃ©e - or soul-mate, as described by a friend - was Teressa, who lived in nearby Canonbie. She was also addicted to various drugs and suffered severe epilepsy. She was 39. Watch The Nine's report from Langholm By this summer, the couple - well-known for their public arguments on the village bus - were dead. Like many users in the area, they had been ordering pills over the internet - diazepam, nitrazepam and fake batches of Xanax, a brand name for alprazolam. Craig was known as a long-term drug user in his local community of Langholm in Dumfries and Galloway Craig's father David told The Nine: ""He just said there were these blue tablets. ""It was only in the last few months that I knew he was ordering tablets over the internet. ""But he wouldn't say exactly what they were. I later found out from one of his friends that it was Xanax. ""I said to him, 'Craig, you've got to come off this stuff.' ""He said, 'Dad, I am trying, I am trying...Trust me, I know what I am doing.' ""But I guess he never."" Craig's brother Stewart raised concerns about the support services he was able to access Craig had been seeking help for his addiction and mental health issues from his local NHS. However, he had complained about the services that were provided. The Nine has seen a chain of emails between his brother Stewart, who lives in Canada, and local NHS staff sent from late 2017 until early 2019. In the emails, Stewart complained of his brother's care, including claims he had been turned away from psychiatric services due to a drink problem. But Craig was also missing appointments as he struggled with money and his drug use. Stewart told the BBC: ""His basic needs weren't being met. He wasn't working. There were days where he couldn't pay for his electricity, days where he couldn't even afford to buy food. He had his ongoing issues at home. ""But then to be expected to travel to take two, three separate buses to get to these appointments, it is just unacceptable."" NHS Dumfries and Galloway would not comment on an individual case. A spokesman said: ""A recognition that 40% non-attendance for first assessments was unsustainable resulted in measures introduced in January 2019 which have seen this non-attendance rate for first assessments fall to 30%."" Craig and Teressa were described as ""soul mates"" by a friend Craig had a turbulent relationship with Teressa. A friend and neighbour of Teressa and Craig, who did not want to be named, said that despite the fights and fall-outs, the two were often inseparable. ""Craig and Teressa always got back together,"" she said. ""It was up-and-down but they loved each other an incredible amount."" However, asked it she thought the couple's relationship would have survived without the presence of drugs or alcohol, she said: ""We won't know otherwise because they were never off drugs to find that answer out."" On 31 January this year, Craig was arrested at Teressa's home after he caused a disturbance and cut himself with a knife. He was remanded before special bail conditions meant the couple would be separated until a trial later in the year. Craig was well-known to police. He had a lengthy criminal history for drugs, assault and careless driving. A day before he was sentenced to a community payback order for the January incident, Craig was caught in Gretna carrying four different types of street tablets. He wasn't charged. However, by that time, it was already too late to return to Teressa. After failing to show up for her methadone subscription, she was found dead in her home on 15 March. Her cause of death is still listed as ""unascertained"". Craig's father David said: ""Craig was devastated. He blamed himself for not being there."" Craig's father, David Wylie, says the family had to wait 18 weeks to find out what killed his son According to his friends and family, Craig couldn't recover from his partner's death. In a letter to his brother, he wrote about his addiction to pills: ""I know I've not helped a bit but something has made me so bad on them, to make me drink and take so much without touching the sides."" He died in his Langholm home on 23 July 2019 - exactly a week after Scotland recorded its highest-ever number of drug-related deaths. Drug deaths taskforce meets for first time Scotland's drug death crisis in six charts What can be done about Scotland's drugs crisis? Despite Crown Office advice that post mortem examination results would be available between six and eight weeks after a death, the family waited 18 weeks to find out exactly what killed him. David received a letter from the Crown Office apologising for the delay, referencing ""detailed negotiations"" between it and the University of Glasgow for pathology services. Eventually, the results confirmed Craig had consumed nitrazepam, diazepam, cannabis and - the drug that ultimately killed him - heroin. Last week, the Crown Office confirmed it was investing an additional Â£300,000 in toxicology services at Glasgow University, which deals with the bulk of Scotland's drug death case. It said the money would ""help clear overdue post-mortem results that are impacting on a large number of bereaved families"". However, it added that a ""long term solution for future delivery"" was being sought from alternative providers as the Glasgow University contract ends next year. The Scottish government has called for greater powers over drug policy to help tackle the problem north of the border. A spokesman said: ""We have invested almost Â£800m to tackle problem alcohol and drug use since 2008, and our 2018 alcohol and drug strategy set out how an additional Â£20m per annum announced the year before is being used to improve local prevention, treatment, and recovery services in areas all across Scotland.""

The sacrifices of Australia's unpaid firefighters,"Daniel Knox stands among flaming bushland during a controlled burn in NSW ""We're doing it because it's a passion. It's a brotherhood,"" says Daniel Knox. ""When that photo was taken of me, I had done a 15-hour shift out there."" He is one of thousands of Australians who've dropped their ordinary lives to battle the nation's raging fire crisis. For weeks, the 22-year-old landscaper has lived around his phone, springing into action when called upon. He is part of the New South Wales Rural Fire Service (NSW RFS) which calls itself ""the world's largest volunteer firefighting organisation"". Its 70,000 members are extensively trained and, except for a few senior staff, mostly unpaid. Mr Knox joined his local brigade in Sydney's south-west five years ago, when he was 17. He bonded with a senior member - Andrew O'Dwyer - over football and photography. ""He took me under his wing, looked after me and helped me out so much. The respect he gave me, a young bloke, even when I made mistakes... he was my brother,"" he told the BBC. Last Thursday, Mr O'Dwyer and Geoffrey Keaton, the deputy captain at the Horsley Park Fire Brigade, were sent out late at night to a massive firefront. Volunteer firefighters Andrew O'Dwyer (left) and Geoffrey Keaton were both fathers to young children En route their truck was hit by a falling tree, which caused it to roll. Three firefighters in the back seat were injured but were able to escape. Mr O'Dwyer and Mr Keaton - both fathers to young children - were killed at the scene. They died five days before Christmas. Since September, close to 3,000 firefighters have been out every day in NSW battling blazes the size of small European countries. Close to 90% of those people on the ground are unpaid volunteers, says the NSW RFS, the government-funded organisation leading the fight. Volunteers make up the majority of the firefighting crews battling Australia's fires This century-old model is common across Victoria, South Australia, and Western Australia - Australian states which have traditionally had bushfires each summer. In recent years, fires have also flared up in Tasmania and sub-tropical Queensland. In NSW, most of the 2,000 or so brigades are found in country towns and rural centres dotted among eucalyptus bushland. Members are almost always locals, stepping in to save their own communities. Historically, the work has tended to be patchy, which has been a key factor behind the volunteerism. Fires don't rage all year round, and there have been years when many areas aren't affected at all. But this year, the situation has changed. Intense blazes typically seen in later summer have flared in spring, forcing authorities to wage full-blown campaigns earlier than ever before. They're also dealing with hundreds more fires, burning simultaneously in hotter and drier conditions. NSW has been in drought for years, and fires are ripping through the state. A visual guide to Australia's bushfire crisis The monstrous Gospers Mountain blaze, an hour's drive north-west of Sydney, has spread to more than 450,000 hectares in size in less than a month. Officials now consider it to be potentially one of the largest fires ever recorded in Australia. For weeks, Lucy Baranowski has been among the crews fighting that blaze, and others closer to her home in Kurrajong Heights. She and her partner took leave from their day jobs a few weeks ago - and are currently skating by on savings, credit cards and support from family and friends. She misses her children - she evacuated them to her parents' home over a week ago. On Saturday, her crew helped save a friend's property - a success. But then the wind changed, and the crew could only watch on as the blaze tore through the neighbouring village of Bilpin. How is Australia tackling climate change? How do you fight extreme wildfires? Why Australia will see a long and dangerous summer The situation is extreme, but she has been buoyed by the ""bubble of love"" from her community, she tells the BBC. Her friends have organised her children's Christmas presents. Others have manned shifts cooking and cleaning for crews at the station. A prolific blogger, her latest posts about her fireground days have gone viral on social media. Lucy Baranowski and her husband have been fighting the fires day after day ""So many people aren't making an income but are putting every part of their passion and blood into this campaign - it's really, really rough on a lot of people,"" she says. She describes the RFS as her family - and in her case this is a literal statement. Out on the fireground she's standing alongside her father and her younger brother, as well her friends, her neighbours, all of them communicating via radio. They've been running on adrenalin, but the prospect of a drawn-out summer and a seemingly endless fire front is weighing on all of them. ""You can just hear the fatigue in their voices and almost imagine their dirty, sweaty, ash-covered faces,"" she says. ""Everyone's working so hard to keep everything together but there's no rain forecast, and there's really nothing we can do to stop this fire."" ""Do we start to give up hope now that this isn't going to stop?"" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

News of the firefighters' deaths at Horsley Park, only a 40-minute drive away, ""shattered my heart"" she says. ""I didn't know them - but that could have been my husband, my father, my uncle, my friend,"" she said. ""After all this is over, we're probably going to fall down in a heap."" The mammoth, ongoing task has spurred a national conversation about support for firefighters. This video can not be played Russell Scholes's home in New South Wales was destroyed by bushfires The Labor opposition, town mayors, and a firefighters' union have called for them to be compensated. ""They volunteer as much as they can afford, sometimes even more than they can afford. It is not sustainable,"" says Mick Holton, president of the Volunteer Fire Fighters Association. It often involves long hours, weeks away from paid work, and accruing expenses along the way. Earlier this year, Mr Knox travelled to the town of Tenterfield to help fight blazes there. It was an eight-hour drive from Sydney - he paid for his own petrol. Why Australia's PM is facing anger over bushfires How climate change has contributed to bushfires Public support for the ""firies"" is at an all-time high. In the swing of the Christmas season, shops and restaurants are donating profits to the NSW RFS. Online, there have been fundraisers to buy masks, food, and other supplies for the crews. However,Australia's government has so far rejected the calls for compensation.,external ""Now is not the time to go into it. Let's get through this [bushfire crisis] first,"" said Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Monday. A day later he announced the government, as a ""model employer"", would grant a minimum 20 days leave entitlement for public servants who went to the fires. An unidentified firefighter seen in the thick smoke and light of a bushfire near Sydney ""When people join these organisations, they do it to protect their community and do it out of a sense of great service,"" he has said. That sentiment is what you hear from many firefighters. They're not motivated by money. They're reticent to speak up for any sort of handout. They've also been consumed with fighting the fires. ""People don't get it, people think how do you risk your life and not get paid for this stuff?"" Mr Knox says. ""And yeah, there have been times when I've been in the thick of it, and it's so fierce you can't breathe. And I'm thinking to myself, what am I doing here?"" ""But when you're on the truck, you're with your brothers,"" he said. He took care of Mr O'Dwyer's young daughter when the prime minister visited the station on Sunday, to meet with her grieving mother.

"Drowned PC was sucked into a whirlpool on holidayShazad Saddique, 38, died on the Isle of Skye while his wife was expecting their fourth child.Manchester","PC Shazad Saddique's family said he ""had a real passion for the outdoors and helping others"". A policeman drowned after being sucked into a whirlpool during an adventure holiday in Scotland, an inquest heard. PC Shazad Saddique, 38, died while swimming near the Fairy Pools waterfall on the Isle of Skye on 19 July. Tourists including a French policeman pulled the father-of-three, of Oldham, Greater Manchester clear but they could not revive him. The Greater Manchester Police (GMP) officer's wife was expecting their fourth child at the time. Rochdale Coroner's Court heard PC Saddique, who was a student officer based in Ashton-under-Lyne,was involved in outreach work with local youthsto get them into the countryside. He had arranged the Scottish trip for 30 people including his brother and 13-year-old son. The court heard that he jumped into the water at Fairy Pools - a natural waterfall phenomenon in the Cuillin Mountain Range in Glen Brittle - with goggles, wetsuit and swimming shoes. He had been swimming for about an hour when tragedy struck. PC Shazad Saddique was also a keen runner who ran marathons around the world and hiked Family friend Temour Ahmed said: ""I heard people shouting and went to the pool I could see Shazad was unresponsive in the water. ""I tried to get into the water but there was a very strong undercurrent which was pulling my trousers down so I got out."" He added: ""It was looking like a whirlpool effect. ''Eventually we were able to get to Shazad from the water but sadly his lips where blue and he was totally unresponsive."" PC Saddique, who joined GMP in 2018, was praised by the coroner for being a ""role model"" Recording a conclusion of death by drowning Coroner Joanne Kearsley recorded a conclusion of death by drowning and said it was a ""very, very sad case"". She added: ''More likely than not he became caught up in a strong current which created a vortex effect."" The coroner also praised PC Saddique for touching ""the lives of many"". His family said he was ""the most selfless person you could ever hope to meet"". Their statement added: ""He was the best dad, and his wife and kids were his absolute world.''

Boeing chief fired but 737 concerns persist,"Boeing has fired its chief executive, Dennis Muilenburg, in a bid to restore confidence in the firm after two deadly crashes involving its 737 Max plane. More than 340 people died in the disasters, prompting accusations that Boeing put profit before safety. Families of the victims welcomed Mr Muilenberg's resignation as overdue. But they said Boeing's decision to replace him with a long-time board member raised questions about its commitment to change. Boeing named David Calhoun, who has served on the firm's board since 2009 and is its current chairman, as chief executive and president. ""While the resignation of Mr Muilenburg is a step in the right direction, it is clear that the Boeing Company needs a revamp of its corporate governance,"" said Paul Njoroge, who lost his wife, three children and mother-in-law when Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 crashed in March. Mr Calhoun ""is not the right person for the job"", he added. What went wrong in Boeing's cockpit? Boeing to temporarily halt 737 Max production in January US regulator knew of Boeing 737 crash risks Boeing 'is not a trustworthy company anymore' Zipporah Kuria, whose father was also killed on the Ethiopian Airlines flight, said Mr Muilenburg should have been replaced ""a long time ago"" but responsibility for the crashes is shared. ""I feel as though a lot more people should have resigned including the person who's becoming CEO,"" she told the BBC. Boeing has been under intense scrutiny since two 737 Max planes crashed within five months of each other, first in Indonesia and then in Ethiopia. The 737 Max fleet has been grounded worldwide since March. While the company had been hoping to have the best-selling jet back in the air by the end of this year, US regulators have made it clear that it would not be certified to return to the skies that quickly. The crash site of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 Last week,Boeing said it would halt production of the aircraft. Then on Friday, the company's reputation took another hit when its Starliner spacecraft suffered technical problems that prevented it from taking the right path to the International Space Station. Boeing's board said it had ""decided that a change in leadership was necessary to restore confidence in the company moving forward as it works to repair relationships with regulators, customers, and all other stakeholders"". Mr Calhoun, a private equity executive, will take over from 13 January. Lawrence Kellner, a board member since 2011, is to become non-executive chairman immediately. ""Under the company's new leadership, Boeing will operate with a renewed commitment to full transparency, including effective and proactive communication with the FAA [Federal Aviation Administration], other global regulators and its customers,"" it said. This video can not be played Senator says he ""would walk before I got on a 737 Max"" Despite the ouster, some of the firm's harshest critics in Washington said they still had questions about the firm's commitment to change. Senator Richard Bumenthal said: ""The company needs new leadership across the board who will take safety seriously."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Michael Stumo, who lost his daughter Samya Rose on the Ethiopian Airlines flight and has organised victims' families against Boeing, called the resignation a ""good first step toward restoring Boeing to a company that focuses on safety and innovation"". ""The next step is for several board members who are underperforming or unqualified to resign,"" he said. Air safety officials investigating the tragedies have identified an automated control system in the plane, known as MCAS, as a factor in both crashes. Boeing has said the MCAS software system, which relied on a single sensor, received erroneous data, which led it to override pilot commands and push the aircraft downwards. It has said it is fixing the software and has overhauled its review procedures. But US lawmakers, who are investigating the company, have said the firm was aware that the software system could be unreliable. They have accused the company of trying to hide the risks and rush the plane back into service. Dennis Muilenburg had faced calls or his resignation Congressman Peter DeFazio, who leads a committee investigating Boeing, had called for Mr Muilenburg's resignation in an interview with the New York Times, published over the weekend. In a statement on Monday,external, he said the shake-up was ""long overdue"". Mr Muilenburg first joined Boeing in 1985. He led the company's defence, space and security division prior to his appointment as chief executive in 2015. He was stripped of his role as chairman of Boeing's board of directors in October andlater agreed to give up his bonus. However, Boeing, including Mr Calhoun, had continued to express confidence in him. Dennis Muilenburg's departure was inevitable, although the timing was unexpected. Since the two accidents, he has faced intense criticism over the corporate culture that existed at Boeing on his watch, and over the company's relationship with regulators. Questions have been asked about how a seemingly flawed aircraft was allowed into service in the first place, and why it was allowed to continue flying after the first accident. There have been claims - emphatically denied by the company - that it prioritised profits and speed of production over safety. His response to the crisis has also come under fire. Although he insisted that Boeing ""owned"" its failures, he also repeatedly said that the crashes were the result of a chain of events. This was seen by some as an attempt to divert blame away from the aerospace giant. The final humiliation came last week, when Boeing announced it would have to suspend production of the 737 Max, because regulators had yet to clear the aircraft as safe to fly again. For months, Mr Muilenburg had insisted the plane would be back in the air by the end of the year. He had lost credibility, and the board decided he had to go.

Salmon producer steps up war on food fraudScottish salmon farmer moves to tackle the sale of fake products ahead of planned US expansionScotland business,"Loch Duart co-founder Andy Bing said he had to take action to protect his company's brand A high-end Scottish salmon producer is taking on the illegal food fraud trade with forensic science, ahead of a big push into the US. Loch Duart has used the technology to launch sting operations on outlets suspected of selling inferior fish, falsely bearing the company's brand. The Sutherland-based firm says it prides itself on farming salmon in an ethical and sustainable way. Food fraudis estimated to cost UK firms up to Â£12bn a year. The practice of intentionally mislabelling cheap products as premium brandsled to the 2013 horsemeat scandal, and hasalso hit the olive oil and coffee industries. Unique markers Andy Bing, who co-founded Loch Duart 20 years ago, said: ""It's illegal, but people are very rarely caught. We want to change that."" He told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme: ""It normally happens in big cities where you get less scrupulous fish wholesalers who will go to a high-end restaurant, say they've got Loch Duart salmon, but they're selling something from a cheaper provenance and invoicing it as Loch Duart salmon."" Mr Bing said his company now exported its fish to 20 countries and protecting the brand was vital, given its ethos of farming salmon on a smaller, greener scale, using more expensive fish feed. Loch Duart teamed up with New Zealand-based firm Oritain, which uses science to find out exactly where products come from. ""Nature gives everything specific markers that is unique to its origin,"" said Mr Bing, who has been in the salmon business for 30 years. ""This technology can take trace elements from the loch in which it's farmed. You have a bank of information and you can match our salmon taken from any market in the world to that bank, and work out whether it's ours."" The technology used to spot fake products is based on forensic science Mr Bing added: ""We've tried to do a couple of stings. We've been led to somewhere by a loyal customer who says, 'I think I've been delivered something which is not the real deal'. ""We've gone down there with our sample bags and tried to apprehend them. ""We've been doing several checks in the south of England over the last few months. A couple of restaurants refused to give us samples. You can draw your own conclusions from that."" Mr Bing said the science, which requires 100 grams of uncooked salmon for a test to be carried out, could be used as evidence in a court case. And he said the science could be used across the food and drink industry. ""Next year we're gong to make a push into America where our brand's very strong, and we're taking this technology with us,"" said Mr Bing. He added: ""We're heavily export-orientated, but we've got to get through Brexit. ""We've got to get the right trade deal, but we believe people want our salmon, they want Scottish whisky and, on a trade level, we'll find a way.""

Boeing to halt 737 Max production,"Boeing will temporarily halt production of its troubled 737 Max airliner in January, the manufacturer said. Production of the jet had continued despite the model being grounded for nine months after two deadly crashes. More than 300 people died when two 737 Max aircraft crashed in Indonesia and Ethiopia after reported problems with a new feature. Boeing had been hoping to have the planes back in the air by the end of this year. But US regulators made it clear that they would not be certified to return to the skies that quickly. Boeing is one of the largest US exporters. The company said in a statement that it would not lay off workers associated with the 737 Max, but the stoppage is likely to affect suppliers and the wider economy. What went wrong in Boeing's cockpit? US regulator knew of Boeing 737 crash risks 'I lost all my children in the Boeing plane crash' ""Safely returning the 737 Max to service is our top priority,"" the aircraft manufacturer said. ""We know that the process of approving the 737 Max's return to service, and of determining appropriate training requirements, must be extraordinarily thorough and robust, to ensure that our regulators, customers, and the flying public have confidence in the 737 Max updates."" Last week a congressional hearing was told that US aviation regulators were aware, following the first crash in Indonesia in October 2018, that there was a risk of further accidents. The Federal Aviation Authority's analysis suggested there could be more than a dozen more crashes over the lifetime of the aircraft unless changes were made to its design. This video can not be played Boeing 737 crashes: What went wrong? Despite that, the 737 Max was not grounded until after the second crash in Ethiopia in March 2019. Boeing is redesigning the automated control system thought to have been the primary cause of the crashes. The manufacturer said it had 400 of the 737 Max aircraft in storage and would focus on delivering those to customers. While many airlines around the world have the planes on order, delivery was halted to allow Boeing's engineers to develop software fixes. The situation surrounding the 737 Max is extraordinary. Nine months after the aircraft was grounded worldwide, it is still not clear when it will be certified to fly again. Regulators - criticised for allowing a flawed aircraft to fly in the first place - are now playing hardball. For Boeing, being forced to shut down the production line is deeply embarrassing - and likely to prove costly. But it is a huge business, and it can at least redeploy many of its workers. But if the stoppage goes on for long, suppliers could be badly hit. Boeing sits at the top of a global supply chain, ranging from major businesses to small operators. Here in the UK, for example, the company works across 65 sites, including a factory in Sheffield. But it draws on a network of some 300 suppliers. For smaller firms in particular, losing 737-related work could prove serious - hitting revenues and potentially forcing them to lay off workers as well. Travel industry analyst Henry Harteveldt said the decision to suspend production was unprecedented and likely to have a ""massive impact on Boeing, its suppliers and the airlines"". ""It's really going to create some chaos for the airlines that are involved in this as well as the 600 or so companies that are part of the 737 Max supply chain and Boeing itself."" The suspension of the 737 Max has already cost Boeing around $9bn (Â£6.75bn). Boeing shares fell more than 4% on Monday amid speculation production would be suspended. All Boeing 737 Max planes are currently grounded The production freeze is expected to be felt across the plane's global supply chain. Teal Group aviation analyst Richard Aboulafia described Boeing's options for managing the blow to its suppliers as ""bad and worse"". He said the plane maker could either allow them to take a hit, or pay them to wait for when the 737 Max is finally cleared to fly. US carriers operate the largest 737 Max fleets, though airlines around the world also use it. ""The Chinese carriers would [also] be quite badly affected. They're some of the biggest users of the Max,"" said Shukor Yusof, aviation analyst at Endau Analytics. In fact, China's three largest carrierswere among the first to press Boeing for compensationover the grounded planes. Aviation analyst Chris Tarrytold the Today programme:""The last thing any manufacturer wants is to stop the production line and it's going to take time to get it going again when the aircraft takes to the skies. ""If we look at it in terms of the volume of the impact on capacity growth in the industry, it is significant and it will take time to recover the production. Boeing's reputation will take time to recover from this as well."" US regulator knew of Boeing 737 crash risks Can China's plane maker take on Boeing? Some suppliers, such as fuselage maker Spirit AeroSystems, are highly dependent on the jet, with half of its revenue attached to it, according to Mr Aboulafia. So far, the supplier has only said it is ""working closely"" with Boeing to determine what impact the production suspension may have. The move by Boeing is unlikely to affect passengers as airlines have leased additional aircraft to replace the 737 Max. It's a different story for airlines, who have the added expense of leasing planes and managing their grounded aircraft. In July,Boeing set aside nearly $5bnto compensate those affected. However, that figure assumed that the 737 Max would fly again this year.
