Winter Hill fire 'may burn for days',"This video can not be played The blaze has spread over Lancashire moorland Firefighters tackling a blaze near a major TV transmitter say it will take days to extinguish but ""fear it may be much longer"". The fire, which started at Winter Hill on Thursday, is smouldering across a 1.9 sq miles (5 sq km) area. A 22-year-old man, from Bolton, was arrested on Friday on suspicion of arson with intent to endanger life. The fire has ""intensified"" following increased winds during the afternoon, Lancashire fire service said. A helicopter has been dropping water over the plume It comes as crews from around the country have joinedfirefighters and the Army to deal with a separate fire at Saddleworth Moorin Greater Manchester, which started on Sunday. Along with the Winter Hill blaze, it has blanketed the region in smoke and ash. People in nearby areas have been asked to keep doors and windows closed. About 100 soldiers from the 4th Battalion, Royal Regiment of Scotland, were sent from their Yorkshire barracks on Thursday to aid firefighters for an initial 48-hour deployment. Their presence has been extended for a further three days following a request by Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham. Soldiers have been drafted in to help tackle the Saddleworth Moor fire The Winter Hill blaze started on Thursday A Lancashire Fire and Rescue Service spokesman said the Winter Hill blaze was currently smouldering between the TV transmitter, which serves viewers in north-west England, and Rivington Pike near Bolton. He said predicting when it would be fully extinguished was ""not an exact science"" and depended on the strength and direction of the wind. Following the hot weather and recent blazes across the region, he appealed for people not to use naked flames near dry grass. The Winter Hill blaze stretches over 1.6 sq miles (5 sq km) Area manager Ben Norman, from the service, explained: ""I wouldn't like to say when we'd be leaving the moors - we are hopeful it would be within the next few days but we fear it may be much longer."" A trench has also been dug to prevent the fire from reaching the highest house on the hill. Mike Sewell and his family were evacuated from their home as fire crews and the water firm United Utilities, which manages an area nearby, tried to protect the property. ""It's been a bit of a nightmare but the fire service has been brilliant, they're keeping us informed all the way,"" he said. ""We've had a few little fires before but nothing on this magnitude. ""Normally there are birds flying around but there are not as many now so that's one of the main downfalls."" A trench has been dug around one family's home About 60 firefighters and 10 fire engines were at the scene of the fire earlier. They have been aided by a helicopter crew, who have been dropping water to help douse the fire. Despite the location, the blaze is not expected to affect local TV transmission services.

Mix-and-match holidays get more protection,"Holidaymakers who book hotels and flights from different firms but via a single travel intermediary will now get the same protection as those buying traditional package holidays. Package holidaymakers are both financially and legally covered if things go wrong. But those who book different elements of their holiday separately have been less well protected. The new EU regulations attempt to close the gap in consumer protection. ""Proper package holidays are the gold standard of travel,"" Simon Calder, travel correspondent at The Independent, told the BBC. ""By booking flights and accommodation in a single transaction from a tour operator, you transfer all the risk to the company. They have to sort out things like cancelled flight or an overbooked hotel. ""They also have to provide a refund or compensation as appropriate. But with the growth of online travel agents, people have been buying what they think is a package holiday, only to discover when it all goes wrong that the travel firm denies all responsibility. ""With these new changes the basic rule is - if it looks like a package holiday, with flights, accommodation and possibly a rental car all included in a single transaction, then it should have with all the prodigious consumer protection that comes with a proper package."" He said that already some companies such as On The Beach and Travel Republic had changed their terms to reflect the change. However he warned that if you are asked to pay separately online for flights and accommodation, it is likely you won't get any extra protection. The government said the new rules would protect an extra 10 million package travel holidays a year. The Package Travel Regulations 2018 were prompted by the growing number of people who book flights, hotels and other tourist services, like car hire, online. Last year 83% of British people booked a holiday over the internet. The new rules will also apply to people who go into a High Street travel agent and pick and choose separate elements of their holiday and pay for them all together. Until now mix-and-match holidays were financially protected, if an airline went out of business, for example. However, if a holidaymaker had a grievance with a hotelier, for example, they would have had to pursue any legal action themselves. Widening the definition of a package holiday means that from now on in such a situation the travel company is ""responsible for making sure that you get the holiday you paid for"", theAssociation of British Travel Agents,external(Abta) said in its guidance on the new rules. ""If something isn't provided or isn't as expected, and your travel company or its suppliers is at fault, they will need to sort this out for you,"" it added. Travel litigation specialist Joanne Brine of JMW Solicitors said: ""Should anything happen while you're on holiday - such as an accident or injury on hotel property - subsequent claims will be more straightforward to deal with, since the operator you booked with will hold liability if travel services aren't provided with reasonable skill and care. ""Plus, if an operator goes bust, you're guaranteed to receive a full refund or, if you're already abroad, to be brought home. Added legal protection also gives the right to help if weather conditions or industrial action hamper your plans. The European Union (EU)Package Travel Directive,externalapplies in all 28 EU nations. Earlier this year, theUK government issued guidance,externalon what it means for the UK travel industry. ""Package holiday regulations have finally been dragged out of the dark ages,"" said Which? travel editor Rory Boland. ""These new rules mean far more holidays will be classed as packages, giving holidaymakers protection when something goes wrong."" However, there are instances when a holidaymaker might think they are fully covered when they are not. That is because there are separate rules for ""linked travel arrangements"" online. This is when someone buys a flight on an airline's website, for example, and pays for it. They might be encouraged to go to a separate accommodation site, either immediately or within the next 24 hours, and they pay for a hotel or car rental separately. This arrangement is not classed as a package. It does not have any legal protection and the financial protection is at a lower level than for packages.

Belgian boy off to university aged 8,"A Belgian boy has graduated secondary school aged eight after completing six years' study in just a year and a half. Laurent Simons, whose father is Belgian and mother Dutch, and has an IQ of 145 according to his parents, collected a diploma with a class of 18-year-olds. Speaking to Belgium's RTBF radio, Laurent said his favourite subject was maths ""because it's so vast, there's statistics, geometry, algebra"". After a two-month holiday from school, he will start university. His father said his son had struggled when he was younger to play with other children, and had not been particularly interested in toys. Laurent said he had considered becoming a surgeon and an astronaut but was now thinking about going into computers. ""If he decided tomorrow to become a carpenter, that would not be a problem for us, as long as he is happy,"" his father said.

NHS to stop 'ineffective' treatments,"Tonsils removal, breast reductions and snoring surgery will be offered to far fewer patients from next year, under plans being drawn up by NHS England. Officials are to discuss proposals to stop or reduce 17 routine procedures deemed to be ""ineffective or risky"". The treatment will be offered only if it is judged to be of ""compelling"" benefit and there are no alternatives. NHS England said the move would affect about 100,000 people every year and free up an estimated Â£200m. The British Society for Surgery of the Hand (BSSH) said cutting back on certain procedures would cost the economy more as people would be unable to work without surgery. Patients at risk of serious harm from their condition will continue to be offered treatment. It follows reviews last year to save Â£190m from supplying over-the-counter medications and treatments described as ""low value"". NHS plans to cut homeopathy treatments NHS plan: What we still need to know Theresa May unveils Â£20bn boost for NHS The announcement comes as thousands of people gathered in central London to mark the 70th anniversary of the NHS and demonstrate against cuts to the health service. Organisers of the rally, which include the People's Assembly - which campaigns against austerity cuts - and unions, are calling for more money for the NHS. This video can not be played Samantha Lilley: ""We are allowing the NHS to become unrecognisable"" NHS England says for most of the 17 procedures under consideration, alternative treatments including physiotherapy, a minor injection or change of diet are likely to be effective. It says the savings made by not carrying out the procedures will be reinvested in better frontline cancer, mental health and other critical services. Its national medical director, Prof Stephen Powis, said: ""If we want the very best clinical care for our patients, we need to stop putting them through treatments where risks and harms outweigh the benefits. ""By reducing unnecessary or risky procedures for some patients we can get better outcomes while reducing waste and targeting resource to where it is most needed."" The plans have the backing of health professionals and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, which advises on the clinical benefits and cost-effectiveness of treatments. It is proposed four treatments will be offered only when a patient makes an individual request. These include surgery for snoring, where there is said to be only limited clinical evidence of effectiveness and which poses significant risks to patients. The others are: dilatation and curettage for heavy menstrual bleeding, knee arthroscopies for osteoarthritis and injections for non-specific back pain. A further 13 procedures will only to be offered when specific criteria are met: Breast reduction Removal of benign skin lesions Grommets for Glue Ear Tonsillectomy for sore throats Haemorrhoid surgery Hysterectomy for heavy menstrual bleeding Chalazia (lesions on eyelids) removal Removal of bone spurs for shoulder pain Carpal tunnel syndrome release Dupuytren's contracture release for  tightening of fingers Ganglion excision - removal of noncancerous lumps on the wrist or hand Trigger finger release Varicose vein surgery NHS England plans to consult publicly on the proposals between 4 July and 28 September, with changes planned to start in 2019-20. Some have criticised the plans. Samantha Lilley, 29, was born with a rare genetic condition called epidermal nevus syndrome, which causes skin lesions. Throughout her life she has had procedures to help the physical and mental suffering but is worried about whether those would be discontinued. She said: ""They're not life threatening, but they're painful and unsightly, to leave them would be detrimental to my health."" She added: ""My condition is lifelong. Is this what the NHS is now - that you must be at death's door to receive treatment? This isn't what it was created for - its purpose was to improve the quality of life of British citizens."" Thousands march through the streets of London on Saturday marking the 70th anniversary of the NHS Matthew Bennett from Bracknell, Berkshire, said having grommets for glue ear fitted when he was a boy fully restored his hearing. He also said his brother benefited hugely from an operation after severe tonsillitis meant he missed time at university time and lost him a job. Mr Bennett said: ""If he hadn't had his tonsils out recently, he'd probably still be struggling with work."" Anthony Stuart, a 52-year-old artist blacksmith, has Dupuytren's contracture - where fingers become permanently bent or flexed - and has had surgery on one of his hands to correct this. He is due to have another procedure to try to correct his other hand in July. He said the treatment had a huge positive impact on his condition. ""I'm astounded that the government can call treatment for Dupuytren's ineffective,"" added Mr Stuart. ""My consultant says if people don't have this procedure it could lead to amputation, which is even more costly to the NHS."" GP Brian Hope said he hoped publishing the list would make people come up with healthier solutions to certain problems. He added: ""We have still got to try and get people to think, 'Wait a minute, could I do something myself - lose weight, be more active?' BSSH President David Shewring said conditions such as Mr Stuart's could force people to take time off work or stop altogether. He also said it was ""wrong"" to brand such procedures unnecessary or risky and did patients a ""huge disservice"". Physiotherapist Lucy Macdonald also welcomed the plans, saying she was pleased knee arthroscopies and shoulder decompressions would be limited, ""because for a long time research has shown they are largely ineffective"". Academy of Medical Royal Colleges chairwoman Prof Carrie MacEwen said the changes would benefit patients, clinicians and the NHS as a whole ""by reducing harm and targeting those who will benefit most"".

Migrant separation protests sweep US,"This video can not be played ""Our humanity is at stake,"" Alicia Keys tells a rally in Washington Tens of thousands of people have joined nationwide protests across the US over the Trump administration's hardline immigration policies. More than 630 events were planned, with protesters calling for migrant families split at the US border to be reunited. Some 2,000 children remain separated from their parents, despite President Donald Trump bowing to public outrage and curtailing the policy. Concerns remain that records were not kept linking parents and children. Major protests took place in Washington DC, New York, and many other cities, using the hashtag #familiesbelongtogether. Marchers held placards calling for no more family separations and for the controversial immigration agency ICE to be abolished. Analysis by Tara McKelvey, White House reporter, BBC News The nation is deeply divided about immigration policy, and the president ignited the debate again with his tweets on Saturday. From his golf resort at Bedminster, New Jersey, he defended the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) on Twitter, describing it as the ""smartest, toughest and most spirited"" of law-enforcement groups. Meanwhile the movement to abolish ICE has been ""going mainstream"", according to some activists, and thousands have taken to the streets to protest the president's policies. More than 100 protesters gathered near the president's resort (""My civility is locked in a cage"", said one of their signs). I drove past the protesters on my way to the resort where I spent part of the day. As demonstrations heated up in New Jersey and across the US, the president was doubling down on his effort to promote his hardline policies. ""It goes against everything we stand for as a country,"" one protester, Paula Flores-Marques, 27, told Reuters in front of the White House in Washington DC. President Trump was out of town. In New York they chanted, ""Say it loud, say it clear, refugees are welcome here"". In Chicago, protesters marched to the local offices of federal immigration authorities. The original Trump administration ""zero tolerance"" policy required authorities to arrest and detain anyone crossing the Mexico-US border illegally. That meant separating children from their parents and holding them separately. This video can not be played What do Trump supporters make of the family separations? Faced with a massive public outcry after recordings were published of distressed, crying children in detention centres, President Trump promised to ""keep families together"" in migrant detention centres. Migrant families separation: The big picture explained But critics say the order did not address the issue of families already separated, leaving uncertainty over the fate of 2,342 children taken away from their parents between 5 May and 9 June alone. Earlier this week,a judge in California ordered the families to be reunited within 30 days. It also still requires authorities to detain immigrant families, rather than release them with a court date to return. Organisers said they wanted to send a message to President Trump, prompted by concerns that he would renege on his executive order. ""We cannot slow down now since the court ruling alone isn't enough and could be overturned,"" said a statement on the movement's website. This video can not be played Veronica is terrified she'll be separated from her daughter when she seeks asylum at the US border As well as the reunification of parents and children, organisers called for an end to immigrant detention - even when families are kept together - and also planned to voice opposition to President Trump's travel ban targeting five majority-Muslim nations, which was upheld by the US Supreme Court earlier this week. What is the Trump travel ban? 'Imagine your child clinging to your leg' Children 'in cages' in Texas Demonstrations were also likely to focus on the shake-up of the Supreme Court after Anthony Kennedy announced his retirement last week,giving President Trump the opportunity to solidify a conservative majority on the country's top court. This video can not be played Drone footage shows a ""tent city"" immigration centre Much of the uproar over the separation policy came after news organisations reported on children being held in cells, converted warehouses and desert tents around the country. President Trump on Saturday defended the agency that played a central role in carrying out the separations - the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). He told its employees: ""You are doing a fantastic job of keeping us safe by eradicating the worst criminal elements. So brave!"" Organisers issued instructions for people to dress in white, to represent peace and unity. The main march is taking place in Washington DC, but one of the people behind the movement, Anna Galland, said separate events were planned in 50 states. Allow Twitter content?

The protests are not the first against Mr Trump's immigration policy. Nearly 600 women were arrested on Thursday during a sit-in at a US Senate building against the government's migration policy.Actress Susan Sarandon was among those detained. Many were draped in foil sheets to highlight the flimsy bedding given to migrant children held in border detention facilities. President Trump's ""zero tolerance"" policy has strong support among his key Republican support base. He has repeatedly defended the policy, saying it is simply enforcing the law. Under a crackdown rolled out in May, all border crossers - including first-time offenders - are criminally charged and jailed.

Where are Unesco's new World Heritage sites?,"Mountain monasteries in South Korea, a Saudi oasis and Mumbai's art deco buildings are among a number of sites to make it on to Unesco's World Heritage List. Being listed gives them legal protection under international treaties. The UN's cultural organisation, meeting in Bahrain, have been agreeing which landmark sites around the world need preserving for their cultural, historic or scientific significance. Here are some of the chosen sites,external: Bibi Maryam Mausoleum in Qalhat, Oman In the east of Oman, the walled city of Qalhat was a bustling port in the 11th and 15th Centuries. It is a ""unique archaeological testimony"" to the links between the east of Arabia and the rest of the world, says Unesco. Oman profile Nokubi Church, Nagasaki The site on Kyushu island consists of 10 villages, a castle and a cathedral and were built between the 18th and 19th Centuries, at a time when the Christian faith was banned in Japan. They reflect the earliest activities of Christian missionaries and settlers in Japan, and ""bear unique testimony to a cultural tradition nurtured by hidden Christians"", Unesco says. Japan country profile Art deco buildings adorn Mumbai's Marine Drive Having become a global trading hub in the late 19th century, Mumbai embarked on an ambitious urban planning project, constructing beautiful buildings for residential and commercial use. The Victorian buildings are more classical constructions with balconies and verandas, while the Art Deco buildings are cinemas, flats and hospitals in an array of colours. ""These two ensembles bear testimony to the phases of modernization that Mumbai has undergone in the course of the 19th and 20th centuries,"" Unesco says. Is Mumbai India's most unliveable city? Al-Ahsa boasts more than two million palm trees Al-Ahsa, in the eastern Arabian peninsula, is the largest oasis in the world and has been home to humans from the Neolithic era to the present day. It also boasts 2.5 million date palms, gardens, canals, springs, wells, a drainage lake, historical buildings and archaeological sites. Unesco called it ""an exceptional example of human interaction with the environment"". Saudi Arabia profile Saudi wastes no time to rap at the wheel Magoksa temple in Gongju is one of the seven ancient temples The Sansa mountain monasteries in the south of South Korea have been operating as centres of faith since the 7th Century. The seven temples contain open courtyards with lecture halls, pavilions and ornate Buddha halls. Unesco called them ""sacred places, which have survived as living centres of faith and daily religious practice to the present"". South Korea profile Qal'eh Dokhtar castle in Fars The mix of fortified structures, palaces, and city plans - at eight archaeological sites across Fars province - date back to the era of the Sassanian Empire, from the 3rd to 5th Centuries. The sites not only reflect the ""optimised utilisation of natural topography"", but also bear witness to the influence of Roman art and the Achaemenid and Parthian cultural traditions, Unesco says. Iran country profile An entrance at the Thimlich Ohinga dry-stone wall settlement The Thimlich Ohinga is the largest and best preserved dry-stone wall settlement, typical of Kenya's Lake Victoria region. The settlement, situated north-west of Migori town, is thought to have been built in the 16th Century and appears to have served as a fort for communities and livestock.

Women praise razor ad with real body hair,"Despite being a razor brand, Billie says it wants to remove the stigma around body hair ""Body hair. Everyone has it."" Simple words, but they've prompted a debate in the US and beyond this week thanks to a new razor advert that shows women actually shaving their body hair. Surely that's not so revolutionary? Except it is - because normally ads for women's razors show plastic-perfect, airbrushed legs that are already totally smooth. Razor brand Billie says it's the first to feature hairy women for 100 years and the advert has gone viral as a result. Allow Facebook content? This article contains content provided by Facebook.

On social media, many women applauded its close-ups of hairy female toes, armpits, monobrows and stomachs. ""THIS IS DAMN BEAUTIFUL"" wrote Instagram user @bigparadethroughtown. ""I don't like razors but that ad is dope,"" agreed @hanguk0. ""When brands pretend that all women have hairless bodies,it's a version of body-shaming,"" Billie co-founder Georgina Gooley told Glamour magazine,external. ""It's saying you should feel ashamed of having body hair."" As well as its advert, the brand has launched an online campaign to normalise images of fuzzy, stubbly, natural women. It has donated positive, unflinching pictures to the stock photo site Unsplash,external, which people can use for free. Fans of the ad campaign said it had made them feel more positive about their body hair Amid the tide of support, however, some asked why a razor company would be trying to reduce taboos around body hair. In a piece for US website Slate, writer Rachelle Hampton observed: ""It's true that at this point in life, I enjoy the feeling of a smooth leg as much as anybody else,external. But I wouldn't have started shaving had I not been convinced by the age of 11 that there was something fundamentally wrong with having body hair."" Can a company selling razors really say it's not complicit in that? Billie addresses the issue with a line of pop-up text: ""If and when you feel like shaving, we're here."" And interestingly, not all the women are smooth-shaven when the advert ends.

Dormant Oyster card ÃÂ£321m 'cash mountain',"More than 100 million people have used Oyster cards since they were launched 15 years ago More should be done to remind Transport for London customers to claim Â£321m from ""dormant"" Oyster cards, a London Assembly member has said. Liberal Democrat Caroline Pidgeon accused Transport for London (TfL) of keeping ""incredibly quiet"" about the ""cash mountain"". TfL said it is ""committed"" to helping passengers get their money back. More than 100 million people have used the electronic travel cards since they were launched 15 years ago. More than Â£321m of balances and deposits are sitting on Oyster cards that have not been used for at least a year, TfL figures show. Contactless payments are thought to have contributed to a reduction in Oyster card use Ms Pidgeon, chair of City Hall's transport committee, put the ""soaring"" figure partly down to the number of people switching in recent years to making contactless payments with their bank cards. She said: ""TfL never stops bombarding us with advertisements and information campaigns, but highlighting this cash mountain is one issue that they remain incredibly quiet about. ""It is time TfL devoted far more time and energy telling the public how they can get their own money back."" Oyster cards can be used to pay for journeys by Tube, rail, bus, boat and cable car.

Hunt for biker who 'mowed down' boy,"Mikaeel Miah was ""flipped in the air"" and suffered a serious leg injury An appeal to find a ""callous off-road biker"" who ""mowed down"" a six-year-old boy in Birmingham has begun. Mikaeel Miah was with his dad and eight-month-old sibling when he was hit by a scrambler bike in Burbury Park, Lozells, at 17:30 BST last Saturday. The boy was ""flipped in the air"" and has been left with a compound leg fracture, West Midlands Police said. Mikaeel required emergency surgery to put metal plates and pins into his leg. His father, Farouk, has been warned there is a chance his son could suffer permanent mobility difficulties as a result of the collision. The biker was racing in circuits around the park when Mikaeel was hit and left in ""agony"" as the ""callous offender sped off"". Sgt Martin Williams said police suspected the biker, who was wearing a green helmet, was from the local area and the bike, which had orange parts, was believed to be a scrambler or pit-bike. ""This is a truly callous offence: a man, or possibly a teenager, riding a bike recklessly in a public park has knocked down a little boy and left him with very serious injuries,"" he said. ""It's hard to imagine what kind of person would do this and then drive off, leaving the boy writhing in agony on the floor."" Sgt Williams said the force believes the person responsible is local to Lozells and asked people to ""do the right thing"" and contact police with any information. ""The offender does not deserve any protection; we need to find him as he is clearly a risk to children in the area,"" he said.

US braces for migrant separation protests,"This video can not be played ""Our humanity is at stake,"" Alicia Keys tells a rally in Washington Tens of thousands of people have joined nationwide protests across the US over the Trump administration's hardline immigration policies. More than 630 events were planned, with protesters calling for migrant families split at the US border to be reunited. Some 2,000 children remain separated from their parents, despite President Donald Trump bowing to public outrage and curtailing the policy. Concerns remain that records were not kept linking parents and children. Major protests took place in Washington DC, New York, and many other cities, using the hashtag #familiesbelongtogether. Marchers held placards calling for no more family separations and for the controversial immigration agency ICE to be abolished. Analysis by Tara McKelvey, White House reporter, BBC News The nation is deeply divided about immigration policy, and the president ignited the debate again with his tweets on Saturday. From his golf resort at Bedminster, New Jersey, he defended the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) on Twitter, describing it as the ""smartest, toughest and most spirited"" of law-enforcement groups. Meanwhile the movement to abolish ICE has been ""going mainstream"", according to some activists, and thousands have taken to the streets to protest the president's policies. More than 100 protesters gathered near the president's resort (""My civility is locked in a cage"", said one of their signs). I drove past the protesters on my way to the resort where I spent part of the day. As demonstrations heated up in New Jersey and across the US, the president was doubling down on his effort to promote his hardline policies. ""It goes against everything we stand for as a country,"" one protester, Paula Flores-Marques, 27, told Reuters in front of the White House in Washington DC. President Trump was out of town. In New York they chanted, ""Say it loud, say it clear, refugees are welcome here"". In Chicago, protesters marched to the local offices of federal immigration authorities. The original Trump administration ""zero tolerance"" policy required authorities to arrest and detain anyone crossing the Mexico-US border illegally. That meant separating children from their parents and holding them separately. This video can not be played What do Trump supporters make of the family separations? Faced with a massive public outcry after recordings were published of distressed, crying children in detention centres, President Trump promised to ""keep families together"" in migrant detention centres. Migrant families separation: The big picture explained But critics say the order did not address the issue of families already separated, leaving uncertainty over the fate of 2,342 children taken away from their parents between 5 May and 9 June alone. Earlier this week,a judge in California ordered the families to be reunited within 30 days. It also still requires authorities to detain immigrant families, rather than release them with a court date to return. Organisers said they wanted to send a message to President Trump, prompted by concerns that he would renege on his executive order. ""We cannot slow down now since the court ruling alone isn't enough and could be overturned,"" said a statement on the movement's website. This video can not be played Veronica is terrified she'll be separated from her daughter when she seeks asylum at the US border As well as the reunification of parents and children, organisers called for an end to immigrant detention - even when families are kept together - and also planned to voice opposition to President Trump's travel ban targeting five majority-Muslim nations, which was upheld by the US Supreme Court earlier this week. What is the Trump travel ban? 'Imagine your child clinging to your leg' Children 'in cages' in Texas Demonstrations were also likely to focus on the shake-up of the Supreme Court after Anthony Kennedy announced his retirement last week,giving President Trump the opportunity to solidify a conservative majority on the country's top court. This video can not be played Drone footage shows a ""tent city"" immigration centre Much of the uproar over the separation policy came after news organisations reported on children being held in cells, converted warehouses and desert tents around the country. President Trump on Saturday defended the agency that played a central role in carrying out the separations - the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). He told its employees: ""You are doing a fantastic job of keeping us safe by eradicating the worst criminal elements. So brave!"" Organisers issued instructions for people to dress in white, to represent peace and unity. The main march is taking place in Washington DC, but one of the people behind the movement, Anna Galland, said separate events were planned in 50 states. Allow Twitter content?

The protests are not the first against Mr Trump's immigration policy. Nearly 600 women were arrested on Thursday during a sit-in at a US Senate building against the government's migration policy.Actress Susan Sarandon was among those detained. Many were draped in foil sheets to highlight the flimsy bedding given to migrant children held in border detention facilities. President Trump's ""zero tolerance"" policy has strong support among his key Republican support base. He has repeatedly defended the policy, saying it is simply enforcing the law. Under a crackdown rolled out in May, all border crossers - including first-time offenders - are criminally charged and jailed. This video can not be played ""I have no information on my son"" - one woman's story of being separated from her son Migrant children are not permitted to be incarcerated with their parents and are kept in separate facilities maintained by the Department of Health and Human Services.

Winter Hill fire 'may burn for days'A man who was arrested on suspicion of arson is currently being held in police custody.Lancashire,"This video can not be played The blaze has spread over Lancashire moorland Firefighters tackling a blaze near a major TV transmitter say it will take days to extinguish but ""fear it may be much longer"". The fire, which started at Winter Hill on Thursday, is smouldering across a 1.9 sq miles (5 sq km) area. A 22-year-old man, from Bolton, was arrested on Friday on suspicion of arson with intent to endanger life. The fire has ""intensified"" following increased winds during the afternoon, Lancashire fire service said. A helicopter has been dropping water over the plume It comes as crews from around the country have joinedfirefighters and the Army to deal with a separate fire at Saddleworth Moorin Greater Manchester, which started on Sunday. Along with the Winter Hill blaze, it has blanketed the region in smoke and ash. People in nearby areas have been asked to keep doors and windows closed. About 100 soldiers from the 4th Battalion, Royal Regiment of Scotland, were sent from their Yorkshire barracks on Thursday to aid firefighters for an initial 48-hour deployment. Their presence has been extended for a further three days following a request by Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham. Soldiers have been drafted in to help tackle the Saddleworth Moor fire The Winter Hill blaze started on Thursday A Lancashire Fire and Rescue Service spokesman said the Winter Hill blaze was currently smouldering between the TV transmitter, which serves viewers in north-west England, and Rivington Pike near Bolton. He said predicting when it would be fully extinguished was ""not an exact science"" and depended on the strength and direction of the wind. Following the hot weather and recent blazes across the region, he appealed for people not to use naked flames near dry grass. The Winter Hill blaze stretches over 1.6 sq miles (5 sq km) Area manager Ben Norman, from the service, explained: ""I wouldn't like to say when we'd be leaving the moors - we are hopeful it would be within the next few days but we fear it may be much longer."" A trench has also been dug to prevent the fire from reaching the highest house on the hill. Mike Sewell and his family were evacuated from their home as fire crews and the water firm United Utilities, which manages an area nearby, tried to protect the property. ""It's been a bit of a nightmare but the fire service has been brilliant, they're keeping us informed all the way,"" he said. ""We've had a few little fires before but nothing on this magnitude. ""Normally there are birds flying around but there are not as many now so that's one of the main downfalls."" A trench has been dug around one family's home About 60 firefighters and 10 fire engines were at the scene of the fire earlier. They have been aided by a helicopter crew, who have been dropping water to help douse the fire. Despite the location, the blaze is not expected to affect local TV transmission services.

Rob Delaney's wife expecting baby,"Rob Delaney is best known for his role in the Channel 4 sitcom Catastrophe US actor and comedian Rob Delaney has announced he and his wife Leah are to become parents to their fourth child. The star of the Channel 4 sitcom Catastrophe, who lives in London, shared the news with fans on Twitter. It comes five months after the death of the couple's two-year-old son Henry, who was diagnosed with a brain tumour in 2016 and died in January. In a video, the actor praised the NHS and called for US citizens to campaign for better healthcare. US actor Rob Delaney's son dies aged two Delaney, who has two further children with Leah, wrote on Twitter that two ""typically wonderful"" midwives had visited him and his wife to assess them for a home birth. Continuing his praise for the health service, he sent his ""love"" to protesters marching in London on Saturday to mark the NHS' 70th birthday. The tweet also included a video he made for Democratic Socialists for Medicare for All, talking about the differences between the healthcare systems in the US and the UK. Allow Twitter content?

In the video, Delaney said: ""Our son Henry passed away in January of this year from cancer and he was a beautiful little boy from the moment he was born until the moment he died. ""And he benefited so much from the healthcare system here and so did we as his parents, because while we endured stress that was truly unbelievable, we didn't endure the financial stress of wondering, 'are we going to be able to pay for this?' ""'Are we going to have to move during his treatment because we have to move into a smaller house? Or move in with relatives?' ""That financial stress, we didn't have to endure here, and what a gift."" Delaney revealed his son's battle with the illness in February, saying Henry had been diagnosed with cancer shortly after his first birthday, following persistent vomiting and weight loss. The one-year-old had surgery to remove the tumour and continued with treatment in 2017, but later that year the cancer returned and he died in January, aged two. Then, Delaney thanked the health service,writing on Facebook,external: ""The NHS nurses and doctors and the home carers and charity workers who helped our family survive Henry's illness will be my heroes until the day I die. ""I am desperately sad right now, but I can say with authority that there is good in this world."" He also called on the public not to take the NHS ""for granted"".

Winter Hill fire 'may burn for days'A man who was arrested on suspicion of arson is currently being held in police custody.,"This video can not be played The blaze has spread over Lancashire moorland Firefighters tackling a blaze near a major TV transmitter say it will take days to extinguish but ""fear it may be much longer"". The fire, which started at Winter Hill on Thursday, is smouldering across a 1.9 sq miles (5 sq km) area. A 22-year-old man, from Bolton, was arrested on Friday on suspicion of arson with intent to endanger life. The fire has ""intensified"" following increased winds during the afternoon, Lancashire fire service said. A helicopter has been dropping water over the plume It comes as crews from around the country have joinedfirefighters and the Army to deal with a separate fire at Saddleworth Moorin Greater Manchester, which started on Sunday. Along with the Winter Hill blaze, it has blanketed the region in smoke and ash. People in nearby areas have been asked to keep doors and windows closed. About 100 soldiers from the 4th Battalion, Royal Regiment of Scotland, were sent from their Yorkshire barracks on Thursday to aid firefighters for an initial 48-hour deployment. Their presence has been extended for a further three days following a request by Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham. Soldiers have been drafted in to help tackle the Saddleworth Moor fire The Winter Hill blaze started on Thursday A Lancashire Fire and Rescue Service spokesman said the Winter Hill blaze was currently smouldering between the TV transmitter, which serves viewers in north-west England, and Rivington Pike near Bolton. He said predicting when it would be fully extinguished was ""not an exact science"" and depended on the strength and direction of the wind. Following the hot weather and recent blazes across the region, he appealed for people not to use naked flames near dry grass. The Winter Hill blaze stretches over 1.6 sq miles (5 sq km) Area manager Ben Norman, from the service, explained: ""I wouldn't like to say when we'd be leaving the moors - we are hopeful it would be within the next few days but we fear it may be much longer."" A trench has also been dug to prevent the fire from reaching the highest house on the hill. Mike Sewell and his family were evacuated from their home as fire crews and the water firm United Utilities, which manages an area nearby, tried to protect the property. ""It's been a bit of a nightmare but the fire service has been brilliant, they're keeping us informed all the way,"" he said. ""We've had a few little fires before but nothing on this magnitude. ""Normally there are birds flying around but there are not as many now so that's one of the main downfalls."" A trench has been dug around one family's home About 60 firefighters and 10 fire engines were at the scene of the fire earlier. They have been aided by a helicopter crew, who have been dropping water to help douse the fire. Despite the location, the blaze is not expected to affect local TV transmission services.

The rise and rise of Kylian Mbappe,"Kylian Mbappe grew up playing for Bondy on the outskirts of Paris and his talent was obvious from an early age A lot has happened in a short space of time for Kylian Mbappe. Aged 19, he is lighting up the World Cup for France, scoring twice in their4-3 victory over Argentinain the last 16. It is the latest step in a remarkable rise for a player who was celebrating passing his French high school exams just three summers ago. In less than two years he has become a double Ligue 1 title winner and a regular for France andParis St-Germain,for whom he is expected to sign permanently this summer for 180m euros. Mbappe spent his formative years developing his skills at AS Bondy in the north-eastern suburbs of Paris. The club are experiencing a surge in popularity and are inundated with new members wanting to follow in the footsteps of Mbappe. BBC Sport went to the club where Mbappe started his football journey when he was just a toddler and spoke to those who knew him. For more from BBC World Service, download theirWorld Football Podcast. AS Bondy's senior team play in the 10th tier of French football, in the ""Excellence"" division of the League of Paris ile-de-France but they have a very successful youth system. Players who have passed through their age groups include Sevilla's Sebastien Corchia and DR Congo international Fabrice N'Sakala. Up until only three months ago, Mbappe's father Wilfried was one of the sporting directors at the club looking after the age groups from under-10s up to under-17s but he has had various roles over 25 years at AS Bondy. AS Bondy may soon have to start turning new members away Atmane Airouche, president of AS Bondy:""You could say that Kylian was born here at this club. He was here as a baby when his father was a player and a coach. He was always here and learning about football, even as a toddler. ""When we played games, just before kick-off you'd see a two-year-old walk in with a ball and he'd sit with us to listen to the team talks. I think he's the player here who must have heard the record number of pre-match team talks."" Antonio Riccardi, 28, under-13s coach at AS Bondy:""His father is like my second father so I knew Kylian as a baby but the first time I coached him was when he was six years old. Just a few months after he had started playing here for the debutants age group you could tell he was different. ""Kylian could do much more than the other children. His dribbling was already fantastic and he was much faster than the others."" Airouche:""He was born into football and sport. His father was a youth leader, working with children in the local area and then he was brought in to AS Bondy. He only left us three months ago but his imprint will be here forever. He gave 25 years of his life to us. And his mother is also a big influence. She was a very good professional handball player."" Mbappe was at the famous Clairefontaine academy between the age of 12 and 15 but initially continued to play for Bondy. Riccardi:""Kylian would always think about football, always talk about football, always watch football - and if he wasn't doing that he'd be playing football games on the PlayStation. ""He'd even turn his living room into a football pitch. When he was young I used to take Kylian home from training and I'd babysit until his mother got home from work. ""He always wanted to play in the living room! The sofa or the table would be the goal. He'd say: 'Don't tell my mother, don't tell my father because they don't want me to play here. Please don't tell.' So we used to play and I kept that secret for him. Luckily he never broke anything."" Airouche:""He only thinks about football and that's what makes the difference compared to others. ""Other players think that once they've signed for a club or gone to Clairefontaine they've achieved something, that they've arrived. But no, the hard work is only just starting and Kylian knew that. He'd play anywhere. ""If he came here now and fancied a game he'd just play even now he's a pro. All he thinks about is the game."" Riccardi:""He was a big fan of Cristiano Ronaldo. They were the posters on his bedroom wall, but he was a fan of lots of great players. He didn't follow a particular team but he was a fan of many top footballers. Ronaldo was definitely his childhood hero though."" Mbappe agreed to sign for Monaco at the age of 14. He is said to have turned down every other Ligue 1 side, plus Real Madrid, Chelsea, Manchester City, Liverpool and Bayern Munich. He made his first-team debut for Monaco on 2 December 2015 as a late substitute - in the process breaking former France striker Thierry Henry's record to become Monaco's youngest player at 16 years, 347 days. Mbappe was one of the stars of the Under-19 Euros in Germany in 2016, scoring five goals, including two in the semi-final. The top scorer at that tournament was Jean-Kevin Augustin, who has just left PSG to join German side RB Leipzig. Riccardi:""Kylian was always enthusiastic. You have to work hard when you have a talent like he does because if you don't, others that are less talented but are working hard can catch up. ""In Bondy there were no real moments of difficulty for him because he was far better than the others. But I know that in Monaco the first year was difficult for him because he had a coach that didn't like him very much. Today that coach is no longer at Monaco and Kylian is in PSG and the national team. So it was the coach who was in the wrong."" Airouche:""We went to watch him at the under-19 final, which France won. We met him outside the stadium and we were shocked that he didn't want to go partying with his team-mates. Instead he wanted to go straight home. ""To him, he had achieved his goal to be European champion and was already thinking about his next goal: going back to Monaco, getting into their team, winning more titles. ""I remember when Monaco became champions he was the only player on the pitch who didn't have a mobile phone with him during the celebrations. All the others went out partying, he was the only one who went home to sleep. That's what is so great about him. ""Other professionals should learn from Kylian. You've never reached your goal. Work harder and harder every day."" Mbappe often posts on social media about his family and is very close to his father, Wilfried, and mother, Fayza. He passed his high school exams in science and technology management, combining his studies with his football development. Airouche:""He's a little boy from Bondy who loves football and respects people. That's what we give to our children here. He loves his town, he loves this club, he still talks about it to this day. He's always behind us and when he gets the chance to see the little ones here he does it. That's why lots of people like him because he is simply himself. ""He is a young man who seems to have the maturity of a 40-year-old when he speaks. That's his personality. Generous, respectful and when he comes here he's always just a boy from Bondy and a boy from ASB."" The popularity of AS Bondy has surged since Mbappe's rise to prominence and the club need new sponsors to keep up with demand Riccardi:""He's the same now as he was back then. If he came here now he would say hello to all the young players here, he would give all the coaches a hug, he would take a ball and play with the others. ""We still call and text each other and it's the same easy-going conversations that we had when I was his babysitter. He will never change because his education is so good. Behind him he has his parents, who are fantastic people. He has a great family unit. He believes in family and he doesn't want to let them down."" Airouche:""Kylian's personality - when you see him speaking at 18 but sounding like he's 30, talking with phenomenal maturity - is because of what his parents gave him. They're people that always had their hands on their hearts, they helped a lot. Not just their children but the children here at the club, for them it was the same."" Riccardi:""A move he used to do as a kid that he still does now in the 'passement de jambes' (the stepover). It was his trademark as a boy. From seven or eight years old he was doing that. ""He was the best player I've ever seen in 15 years coaching here. Nobody has even come close. In Paris there are many talents but I'd never seen a talent like him. He was what we call a 'craque' (the best)."" Airouche:""When he was little he was always the smallest but he had technique and vision in the game that most children just don't have. That's why when you see him now you notice he has amazing senses. He's got eyes in the back of his head. He knows how to anticipate where the ball will go. ""Here, he never played for his proper age group, he always played with older children because there was no point leaving him with kids his own age. He'd just get bored. ""Physically that was tough because he was small, but he had the talent that made the difference. He was a phenomenon. Then suddenly, he grew up. I remember not seeing him for a while and then when we met up again he was suddenly as tall as me."" A version of this article was first published on 26 September 2017.

'Livid' Gove rips up EU customs report,"Brexiteer Michael Gove objects to the customs partnership favoured by Theresa May Environment Secretary Michael Gove physically ripped up a report on Theresa May's preferred option for a new customs partnership with the EU. He was said to have been ""livid"" as he felt the government document downplayed his objections to the proposal. It comes amid cabinet splits over the future shape of Brexit, which Mrs May hopes to resolve on Friday. European Council president Donald Tusk has said the UK must agree its position and""lay its cards on the table"". The government has talked publicly abouttwo potential options for its customs relationship with the European Union after Brexit. One, a customs partnership, would mean the UK applies the EU's own tariffs and rules of origin to all goods arriving in the country, intended for the EU. The other, known as maximum facilitation or max-fac, aims to employ new technology to remove the need for physical customs checks where possible. Two groups of cabinet members were looking at each of the plans. The document in question, prepared by civil servants, was supposed to represent the views of a group of cabinet members looking at the customs partnership, including Mr Gove. Why is the customs union important? Laura Kuenssberg: All eyes on cabinet discussion Surge in Britons getting EU nationality The Sun reported Mr Gove ""physically ripped it up to show he wasn't prepared to accept the document as a summary of their discussions"". BBC political correspondent Matt Cole said representatives for Mr Gove had confirmed the paper's claims. Mr Gove was unhappy because it didn't ""reflect his views that a customs partnership would be too bureaucratic and make it harder for Britain to do business"", our correspondent said. Theresa May will convene her cabinet at Chequers on Friday By Matt Cole, BBC political correspondent This outburst of anger - and, crucially, the fact it has become public - is another sign that Cabinet discipline has broken down. The question around Westminster is has Theresa May lost control and, if so, is that irrevocable? In recent days Boris Johnson has beencriticised by colleagueslike Greg Clark and Matthew Hancock for using an expletive to summarise his views about business and Brexit. That was followed by anotherCabinet member Liz Truss sayingit ""wasn't macho"" for people like the defence secretary to publicly demand extra cash. This stuff is normally hidden behind the cloak of collective cabinet responsibility. So, with Michael Gove now happy for it to be known he's ""livid"" about a report by a sub-committee of a sub-committee (yes, that's right), it's only adding to the sense that the prime minister is a ring master whose whip crack is being ignored. It came as Mrs May attended an important summit at which Mr Tusk issued a ""last call"" to the UK to agree its position if a Brexit deal is to be done in time. Mr Tusk said the most difficult issues remained unresolved and quick progress was needed if agreement was to be reached by October. Mrs May and her cabinet are due to meet at Chequers next Friday as they look to agree on a blueprint for the UK's future relationship with the EU. The UK will then publish a White Paper setting out ""in more detail what strong partnership the United Kingdom wants to see with the European Union in the future"", the prime minister has said. Liberal Democrat Brexit spokesman Tom Brake said Mr Gove's ""temper tantrum"" showed ""deep divides within the cabinet"" and the ""petulance of Brexiteers who can sense their lies are being exposed"". He said the cabinet ""need to act less like toddlers and more like senior ministers negotiating one of the most important deals in UK history"".

US braces for migrant separation protestsTens of thousands are expected to join rallies nationwide calling for family reunifications.,"This video can not be played ""Our humanity is at stake,"" Alicia Keys tells a rally in Washington Tens of thousands of people have joined nationwide protests across the US over the Trump administration's hardline immigration policies. More than 630 events were planned, with protesters calling for migrant families split at the US border to be reunited. Some 2,000 children remain separated from their parents, despite President Donald Trump bowing to public outrage and curtailing the policy. Concerns remain that records were not kept linking parents and children. Major protests took place in Washington DC, New York, and many other cities, using the hashtag #familiesbelongtogether. Marchers held placards calling for no more family separations and for the controversial immigration agency ICE to be abolished. Analysis by Tara McKelvey, White House reporter, BBC News The nation is deeply divided about immigration policy, and the president ignited the debate again with his tweets on Saturday. From his golf resort at Bedminster, New Jersey, he defended the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) on Twitter, describing it as the ""smartest, toughest and most spirited"" of law-enforcement groups. Meanwhile the movement to abolish ICE has been ""going mainstream"", according to some activists, and thousands have taken to the streets to protest the president's policies. More than 100 protesters gathered near the president's resort (""My civility is locked in a cage"", said one of their signs). I drove past the protesters on my way to the resort where I spent part of the day. As demonstrations heated up in New Jersey and across the US, the president was doubling down on his effort to promote his hardline policies. ""It goes against everything we stand for as a country,"" one protester, Paula Flores-Marques, 27, told Reuters in front of the White House in Washington DC. President Trump was out of town. In New York they chanted, ""Say it loud, say it clear, refugees are welcome here"". In Chicago, protesters marched to the local offices of federal immigration authorities. The original Trump administration ""zero tolerance"" policy required authorities to arrest and detain anyone crossing the Mexico-US border illegally. That meant separating children from their parents and holding them separately. This video can not be played What do Trump supporters make of the family separations? Faced with a massive public outcry after recordings were published of distressed, crying children in detention centres, President Trump promised to ""keep families together"" in migrant detention centres. Migrant families separation: The big picture explained But critics say the order did not address the issue of families already separated, leaving uncertainty over the fate of 2,342 children taken away from their parents between 5 May and 9 June alone. Earlier this week,a judge in California ordered the families to be reunited within 30 days. It also still requires authorities to detain immigrant families, rather than release them with a court date to return. Organisers said they wanted to send a message to President Trump, prompted by concerns that he would renege on his executive order. ""We cannot slow down now since the court ruling alone isn't enough and could be overturned,"" said a statement on the movement's website. This video can not be played Veronica is terrified she'll be separated from her daughter when she seeks asylum at the US border As well as the reunification of parents and children, organisers called for an end to immigrant detention - even when families are kept together - and also planned to voice opposition to President Trump's travel ban targeting five majority-Muslim nations, which was upheld by the US Supreme Court earlier this week. What is the Trump travel ban? 'Imagine your child clinging to your leg' Children 'in cages' in Texas Demonstrations were also likely to focus on the shake-up of the Supreme Court after Anthony Kennedy announced his retirement last week,giving President Trump the opportunity to solidify a conservative majority on the country's top court. This video can not be played Drone footage shows a ""tent city"" immigration centre Much of the uproar over the separation policy came after news organisations reported on children being held in cells, converted warehouses and desert tents around the country. President Trump on Saturday defended the agency that played a central role in carrying out the separations - the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). He told its employees: ""You are doing a fantastic job of keeping us safe by eradicating the worst criminal elements. So brave!"" Organisers issued instructions for people to dress in white, to represent peace and unity. The main march is taking place in Washington DC, but one of the people behind the movement, Anna Galland, said separate events were planned in 50 states. Allow Twitter content?

The protests are not the first against Mr Trump's immigration policy. Nearly 600 women were arrested on Thursday during a sit-in at a US Senate building against the government's migration policy.Actress Susan Sarandon was among those detained. Many were draped in foil sheets to highlight the flimsy bedding given to migrant children held in border detention facilities. President Trump's ""zero tolerance"" policy has strong support among his key Republican support base. He has repeatedly defended the policy, saying it is simply enforcing the law. Under a crackdown rolled out in May, all border crossers - including first-time offenders - are criminally charged and jailed.

Unions welcome Tata Thyssenkrupp merger,"Tata owns the UK's largest steelworks at Port Talbot Unions have welcomed a merger between Tata Steel and Thyssenkrupp which will create Europe's second-biggest steelmaker. The deal will mean Indian-owned Tata's UK plants are merged into a pan-European venture, which includes the UK's biggest steelworks at Port Talbot. Tata said its ""ambition"" was to not have any compulsory redundancies in the UK as part of the joint venture. The steelworkers' union said the deal may secure jobs and lead to investment. Community general secretary Roy Rickhuss said it had ""the potential to safeguard jobs and steel-making for a generation"". But he also warned the venture would only succeed if there was strategic investment to make sure the business thrived. Merger means investment in Port Talbot blast furnace What's behind the Tata-Thyssenkrupp merger? Tata Steel UK's pensions deal approved German-owned Thyssenkrupp's supervisory board gave the go-ahead to the merger on Friday - the two companies have been in negotiations for more than a year. Between them, they employ about 48,000 workers. The merged group anticipates it will make costs savings of between Â£350m to Â£440m a year. When details of an initial agreement emerged last September, both sides said they expected about 4,000 jobs would go as a result of the merger, half from administration and half from production. In Wales, almost 7,000 people are employed by Tata, including at Deeside and more than 4,000 in Port Talbot. Tata: Turbulent year for UK steel industry Tata had announced in 2016 that it wanted to sell off its entire UK operations - before scrapping plans and optioning for a merger deal. Joe Lynam, BBC business correspondent This merger is a safeguard measure. It protects jobs rather than creates them. And it establishes a pan-European company - better able to face the rigors of world markets. No threat is more immediate than that of a growing tariff war initiated by President Donald Trump. His 25% tariff on all steel being sold in the US has created fears that steel from China, or elsewhere, might be diverted to Europe and sold below what is charged in its home market - a practice known as dumping. And then there's Brexit. When asked what impact that could have on the new Anglo-German firm, Tata Steel UK chief executive Bimlendra Jha said he needed to be able to easily move his products and people across borders. When asked what it would mean if the UK could not secure that outcome, he said that would be ""a sorry state of affairs"". Preserving 7,000 steel jobs in Wales was always going to be the goal, but political events on both sides of the Atlantic may dilute some of the benefits of this merger. While welcoming the deal, unions also wanted an end to uncertainty for workers. Unite union national officer Tony Brady said workers had ""made great sacrifices in working to secure a future for Tata Steel"". ""We will be seeking guarantees over jobs and investment for the UK operations of the joint venture to secure the future of UK steel,"" he added. Ross Murdoch, national officer of the GMB, echoed his comments. Thyssenkrupp chief executive Heinrich Hiesinger has previously said the two companies needed to consolidate and become more efficient because of increasing pressure from imports and an overcapacity within the industry. More recently, European steel makers have faced 25% tariffs on exports to their biggest market, the US. ""The joint venture with Tata Steel is an important milestone for the transformation of Thyssenkrupp to an industrials and service group and will lead to a significant improvement of the financial figures of Thyssenkrupp,""the group said in a statement.,external It added that the ""signing of the definitive agreement is expected shortly"" and that the deal would be subject to clearance in several jurisdictions, including the European Union. Natarajan Chandrasekaran, chairman of Tata Steel, said: ""This is a significant milestone for Tata Steel and we remain fully committed to the long-term interest of the joint venture company. ""We are confident that this company will create value for all stakeholders."" The venture will create the second biggest steel firm in Europe after Arcelor Mittal. The new company, called Thyssenkrupp Tata Steel, would have annual sales of about Â£13bn and be based in the Netherlands.

The making of France star Mbappe,"Kylian Mbappe grew up playing for Bondy on the outskirts of Paris and his talent was obvious from an early age A lot has happened in a short space of time for Kylian Mbappe. Aged 19, he is lighting up the World Cup for France, scoring twice in their4-3 victory over Argentinain the last 16. It is the latest step in a remarkable rise for a player who was celebrating passing his French high school exams just three summers ago. In less than two years he has become a double Ligue 1 title winner and a regular for France andParis St-Germain,for whom he is expected to sign permanently this summer for 180m euros. Mbappe spent his formative years developing his skills at AS Bondy in the north-eastern suburbs of Paris. The club are experiencing a surge in popularity and are inundated with new members wanting to follow in the footsteps of Mbappe. BBC Sport went to the club where Mbappe started his football journey when he was just a toddler and spoke to those who knew him. For more from BBC World Service, download theirWorld Football Podcast. AS Bondy's senior team play in the 10th tier of French football, in the ""Excellence"" division of the League of Paris ile-de-France but they have a very successful youth system. Players who have passed through their age groups include Sevilla's Sebastien Corchia and DR Congo international Fabrice N'Sakala. Up until only three months ago, Mbappe's father Wilfried was one of the sporting directors at the club looking after the age groups from under-10s up to under-17s but he has had various roles over 25 years at AS Bondy. AS Bondy may soon have to start turning new members away Atmane Airouche, president of AS Bondy:""You could say that Kylian was born here at this club. He was here as a baby when his father was a player and a coach. He was always here and learning about football, even as a toddler. ""When we played games, just before kick-off you'd see a two-year-old walk in with a ball and he'd sit with us to listen to the team talks. I think he's the player here who must have heard the record number of pre-match team talks."" Antonio Riccardi, 28, under-13s coach at AS Bondy:""His father is like my second father so I knew Kylian as a baby but the first time I coached him was when he was six years old. Just a few months after he had started playing here for the debutants age group you could tell he was different. ""Kylian could do much more than the other children. His dribbling was already fantastic and he was much faster than the others."" Airouche:""He was born into football and sport. His father was a youth leader, working with children in the local area and then he was brought in to AS Bondy. He only left us three months ago but his imprint will be here forever. He gave 25 years of his life to us. And his mother is also a big influence. She was a very good professional handball player."" Mbappe was at the famous Clairefontaine academy between the age of 12 and 15 but initially continued to play for Bondy. Riccardi:""Kylian would always think about football, always talk about football, always watch football - and if he wasn't doing that he'd be playing football games on the PlayStation. ""He'd even turn his living room into a football pitch. When he was young I used to take Kylian home from training and I'd babysit until his mother got home from work. ""He always wanted to play in the living room! The sofa or the table would be the goal. He'd say: 'Don't tell my mother, don't tell my father because they don't want me to play here. Please don't tell.' So we used to play and I kept that secret for him. Luckily he never broke anything."" Airouche:""He only thinks about football and that's what makes the difference compared to others. ""Other players think that once they've signed for a club or gone to Clairefontaine they've achieved something, that they've arrived. But no, the hard work is only just starting and Kylian knew that. He'd play anywhere. ""If he came here now and fancied a game he'd just play even now he's a pro. All he thinks about is the game."" Riccardi:""He was a big fan of Cristiano Ronaldo. They were the posters on his bedroom wall, but he was a fan of lots of great players. He didn't follow a particular team but he was a fan of many top footballers. Ronaldo was definitely his childhood hero though."" Mbappe agreed to sign for Monaco at the age of 14. He is said to have turned down every other Ligue 1 side, plus Real Madrid, Chelsea, Manchester City, Liverpool and Bayern Munich. He made his first-team debut for Monaco on 2 December 2015 as a late substitute - in the process breaking former France striker Thierry Henry's record to become Monaco's youngest player at 16 years, 347 days. Mbappe was one of the stars of the Under-19 Euros in Germany in 2016, scoring five goals, including two in the semi-final. The top scorer at that tournament was Jean-Kevin Augustin, who has just left PSG to join German side RB Leipzig. Riccardi:""Kylian was always enthusiastic. You have to work hard when you have a talent like he does because if you don't, others that are less talented but are working hard can catch up. ""In Bondy there were no real moments of difficulty for him because he was far better than the others. But I know that in Monaco the first year was difficult for him because he had a coach that didn't like him very much. Today that coach is no longer at Monaco and Kylian is in PSG and the national team. So it was the coach who was in the wrong."" Airouche:""We went to watch him at the under-19 final, which France won. We met him outside the stadium and we were shocked that he didn't want to go partying with his team-mates. Instead he wanted to go straight home. ""To him, he had achieved his goal to be European champion and was already thinking about his next goal: going back to Monaco, getting into their team, winning more titles. ""I remember when Monaco became champions he was the only player on the pitch who didn't have a mobile phone with him during the celebrations. All the others went out partying, he was the only one who went home to sleep. That's what is so great about him. ""Other professionals should learn from Kylian. You've never reached your goal. Work harder and harder every day."" Mbappe often posts on social media about his family and is very close to his father, Wilfried, and mother, Fayza. He passed his high school exams in science and technology management, combining his studies with his football development. Airouche:""He's a little boy from Bondy who loves football and respects people. That's what we give to our children here. He loves his town, he loves this club, he still talks about it to this day. He's always behind us and when he gets the chance to see the little ones here he does it. That's why lots of people like him because he is simply himself. ""He is a young man who seems to have the maturity of a 40-year-old when he speaks. That's his personality. Generous, respectful and when he comes here he's always just a boy from Bondy and a boy from ASB."" The popularity of AS Bondy has surged since Mbappe's rise to prominence and the club need new sponsors to keep up with demand Riccardi:""He's the same now as he was back then. If he came here now he would say hello to all the young players here, he would give all the coaches a hug, he would take a ball and play with the others. ""We still call and text each other and it's the same easy-going conversations that we had when I was his babysitter. He will never change because his education is so good. Behind him he has his parents, who are fantastic people. He has a great family unit. He believes in family and he doesn't want to let them down."" Airouche:""Kylian's personality - when you see him speaking at 18 but sounding like he's 30, talking with phenomenal maturity - is because of what his parents gave him. They're people that always had their hands on their hearts, they helped a lot. Not just their children but the children here at the club, for them it was the same."" Riccardi:""A move he used to do as a kid that he still does now in the 'passement de jambes' (the stepover). It was his trademark as a boy. From seven or eight years old he was doing that. ""He was the best player I've ever seen in 15 years coaching here. Nobody has even come close. In Paris there are many talents but I'd never seen a talent like him. He was what we call a 'craque' (the best)."" Airouche:""When he was little he was always the smallest but he had technique and vision in the game that most children just don't have. That's why when you see him now you notice he has amazing senses. He's got eyes in the back of his head. He knows how to anticipate where the ball will go. ""Here, he never played for his proper age group, he always played with older children because there was no point leaving him with kids his own age. He'd just get bored. ""Physically that was tough because he was small, but he had the talent that made the difference. He was a phenomenon. Then suddenly, he grew up. I remember not seeing him for a while and then when we met up again he was suddenly as tall as me."" A version of this article was first published on 26 September 2017.

Surge in Britons getting EU nationality,"There has been a surge in UK citizens acquiring the nationality of another EU country since the Brexit referendum, according to data obtained by the BBC. In 2017 a total of 13,141 UK citizens obtained the nationality of one of the 18 member states from which the BBC has received figures. This compares with 5,056 in 2016 and only 1,826 in 2015. The most frequent new nationality was German, which saw a huge jump from just 594 cases in 2015 up to 7,493 in 2017. One applicant, Paul Petty, from Bath, gained a German passport and is now a dual German/British citizen. ""I feel like Europe is pulling apart a bit at the moment,"" he told the BBC. ""I want to remain part of the EU."" More Britons became EU citizens in 2016 All you need to know about Brexit It took three weeks for Mr Petty to receive his new passport. He was eligible because of his mother's status as a Jewish refugee. He described the process as ""really easy"", as he still had his mother's passport. The rise is presumed to be the result of Britons who can meet the criteria seeking to keep their legal rights attached to European Union membership. The 2017 figure is about seven times the 2015 level. The dramatic increase is consistent across many countries.  France was the second most popular nationality, jumping from 320 instances in 2015 to 1,518 last year, and then Belgium, where the increase was from 127 to 1,381. The number for Ireland rose from 54 in 2015 to 529 in 2017. However, this does not include new Irish passport applications from the much larger number of people who already had entitlement to Irish citizenship, due for example to being born in Northern Ireland. Their new nationalities will guarantee the recipients the rights to travel, live and work throughout the EU after Brexit, and they may be able to pass these on to their children. In most cases those involved have also retained their British citizenship and so have become dual nationals. Lucy Hales has been living in Italy for five years, having previously spent 12 years in Spain, and plans to apply for Italian passports. ""It is likely that we will move to another European country, because of my husband's job, so having Italian citizenship would give us some certainty,"" she said. The BBC has obtained this data for 2017 from 18 of the 27 other EU member states. In the other cases it is not yet ready for publication. These 18 include most of the particularly relevant countries, accounting for over three-quarters of all such new citizenships in 2016. Only a limited proportion of British citizens would qualify for citizenship of another EU state. The bureaucratic process of applying can be slow and laborious. The criteria vary from one country to another and are sometimes complex, usually depending on ancestry and family links or residency. In the case of Germany, there is special provision for people whose German ancestors were victims of Nazi persecution. British citizens who fit a nation's requirements will still be able to apply after Brexit, although for some countries there may be complications. For example, Germany allows dual nationality only with EU states. Unless this changes Britons who become German after Brexit has happened could then find they have to renounce their UK citizenship.

Virgin Atlantic stops forced deportations,"Virgin Atlantic is to stop working with the Home Office on forcible deportations from the UK of people deemed to be illegal immigrants. The British airline says it has informed the government of its decision, saying it was ""in the best interest of our customers and people"". It comes amid concern over the removal of Windrush generation migrants and LGBT asylum seekers. Activists are urging other airlines to take similar action. Who are the Windrush generation? 40% of deportation flights cancelled Reality Check: Has the 'hostile environment' worked? Virgin Atlantic said: ""We've made the decision to end all involuntary deportations on our network, and have already informed the Home Office."" A spokeswoman declined to give details of the number of Virgin Atlantic flights or individuals affected. According to the Guardian,,externalVirgin has provided seats on its commercial flights to detainees and security officers accompanying them for many years. A charity in Jamaica that helps resettle deported people told the paper detainees regularly arrived on Virgin flights. Immigration Minister Caroline Nokestold Parliament last month,externalthe majority of enforced deportations used scheduled flights, where people sit alongside paying passengers. She also revealedthe government spent Â£17m,externalon such flights between 2016 and 2017 and Â£17.3m between 2015 and 2016. Activist group Lesbians and Gays Support the Migrants said Virgin told it of the move in response to a yet-to-be published open letter it has written highlighting the deportations of people to countries where they risked persecution. Sam Bjorn from the group added: ""The fact that the company has finally opted to break with this controversial practice testifies to a profound shift in public opinion on deportation since the emergence of the Windrush scandal."" The Windrush scandal hit headlines in April after it emerged that some migrants from Commonwealth countries, who were encouraged to settle in the UK from the late 1940s to 1973, were being wrongly categorised as illegal immigrants. They were part of what is known as the Windrush generation - a reference to the Empire Windrush - the ship that brought workers from the West Indies to Britain in 1948. Their treatment coincided with the Home Office's adoption of a ""hostile environment"" approach, designed to tackle the issue of illegal immigration, and so far, thedepartment has identified 63 people as having been possibly wrongly deported. Lesbians and Gays Support the Migrants wants British Airways and Qatar Airways - who also work on enforced deportations with the government - to end their involvement. Labour MP Stephen Doughty, who is on the Home Affairs Select Committee, has been questioning the government over its deportation policies and welcomed the move from Virgin Atlantic. He told the BBC: ""The whole system of detention and deportation appears to have serious flaws, not just for the Windrush generation, but other individuals who have been subject to wrongful detention - including one of my constituents. ""So it is a business decision for airlines, around their culture and ethics."" Asked if other airlines should follow suit, Mr Doughty added: ""If they want to facilitate this system that has a series of questions around its checks and balances... well, they may want to think about it again."" The airlines did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A Home Office spokesman said: ""We do not comment on operational matters.""

Four dead and three hurt in Leeds crash,"The four men, aged 18, 19, 19, and 21, died at the scene Four young men died and a teenage girl was left critically ill in a collision involving a car and a taxi in the early hours. The four men, aged 18, 19, 19, and 21, died at the scene on the A6120 outer ring road, West Yorkshire Police said. Their Seat Leon ""was travelling at speed"" when it crashed in Horsforth at about 02:40 BST, the force said. Two girls, aged 16 and 17 also in the car, were taken to hospital.  The Uber taxi driver was also seriously hurt. The 16-year-old remains in a critical condition and the 17-year-old's injuries are not considered life threatening, the force said. All six people who were in the car come from the local area, said police. The driver of the taxi, a 42-year-old man from Bradford, is also being treated in hospital but his condition is not considered life threatening. More stories from Yorkshire Acting Supt Richard Padwell, of Leeds District Police, said: ""The deaths of four young people in these circumstances is clearly very tragic and our thoughts and condolences go out to everyone affected by it. ""We don't underestimate the impact that the deaths of these young people will be having in the community and we would ask that people focus on supporting each other and supporting the police investigation."" Acting Supt Richard Padwell said the car was travelling 'at speed' Allan Vickers, who lives nearby, said he was woken by a ""big crash"" and it was ""like a chimney coming down"". When he went outside to help he said police were already there and would not let him through. He described the scene as ""chaos, carnage, people being dragged out and given CPR, it's something you don't want to see, it's awful."" He said the emergency services' response had been ""epic, fast as lightning, they were here in a flash"". The road, which has a 40mph speed limit, had witnessed other high-speed crashes, Mr Vickers said, adding: ""This is my third time here, it's a blackspot"". An investigation is under way into the collision on Broadway, at the junction of Bank Gardens. Debris littered Broadway at the scene of the crash The A6120 outer ring road remains closed in Horsforth Measles outbreak prompts health warning Girl breaks spine in 60ft cliff fall Winter Hill fire may burn for days, fire crews fear The crash occurred in the early hours of Saturday Sgt Fiona Hoodless said: ""This is a very tragic incident where four young men have lost their lives and three other people are in hospital with serious injuries.

NHS plan: What we need to know,"It was a significant funding announcement - few at senior levels in the NHS in England disagree with that. But as the dust settles after the weekend, several unanswered questions are still hanging in the air. What about the areas of health which are not covered? What about investment in hospital buildings and equipment? How will it be paid for? NHS funding: PM calls for 10-year plan to spend cash Chris Ham of the King's Fund told the BBC's Today programme that the 3.4% annual budget increases above inflation for NHS England amounted to a welcome funding boost which would go ""some way to dealing with operational pressures"". Others, including Sir David Nicholson, former head of NHS England, have praised Jeremy Hunt, the Health and Social Care Secretary, for his efforts in robust negotiations with the Treasury which were not concluded till late on Friday night. Sir David said on Twitter ""I do not believe that any other of the Secretaries of State that I have worked for could have got more out of the Treasury than Jeremy Hunt has - congratulations, longevity has its benefits"". Health leaders acknowledge that to be given a five year budget ahead of the main Whitehall spending review is unprecedented in recent times. They say it will allow them to plan the future delivery of services with more certainty.  An extra Â£4bn annually in real terms by 2023 will be allocated to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland as a consequence of the new financial package for England. But what now can be delivered? Chris Ham has urged caution about promising big improvements. The health think tanks had argued before the announcement that a 3.3% annual health spending increase in England was needed just to sustain current levels of care, given the demand pressures associated with an ageing population. The five year spending settlement covers frontline NHS services in England but not investment in new buildings and technology, known as capital spending. Funding in this area has been cut back in recent years to prop up day to day running costs of hospitals. Government sources indicate that the capital spending allocations will be set out in the autumn and Jeremy Hunt is expected to call for a 10-year plan. But given the recent squeeze on capital funding there will be scepticism until the details are spelled out. The money announced over the weekend is for NHS England and does not cover public health, including prevention initiatives. Local authorities are responsible for services in this area and have seen their budgets cut in recent years. Waiting times for sexual health clinics have increased with finances under pressure. The funding of Health Education England, covering the training of doctors, nurses and other health professionals, is also not part of the new Government deal. Like public health, budgets were squeezed and one result was the abolition of free tuition for nurse trainees. Many in the health world will suspend judgement until financial plans for public health and medical training are set out later this year. They remember only too well that the former Chancellor George Osborne's plan to fund the NHS in 2014 excluded other areas of health spending. Social care remains the big unknown. The government did not promise a funding announcement for both the NHS and social care this summer but is committed to a policy statement (a so-called Green Paper) within weeks. Ministers know that failure to come up with a credible plan for funding will severely damage the credibility of the new NHS funding strategy. Caroline Dinenage, the care minister, told the BBC that dealing with NHS finances and not social care was like running a bath without a tap in place. Jeremy Hunt, after a hectic few weeks of talks on NHS funding, now has to turn his mind to social care. He told the Today programme it would be ""funded so as not to create additional pressure on the system."" The funding package for local authorities providing care, expected in the spending review, will be closely scrutinised. So too any new ideas put forward to tackle the problems caused by means testing. A winter of severe strain on the NHS in England and rising waiting times left Mr Hunt and ministerial colleagues under pressure to come up with new money and thinking for a service which was creaking at the seams. The first important steps have been taken. Several more will be needed to convince patients and the wider public that the government really has got a grip.

NHS cuts dandruff treatment,"NHS England has announced a crackdown on the treatment of ""minor"" ailments such as dandruff and diarrhoea. Thirty-five treatments responsible for Â£570m of spending have been targeted. All are available over-the-counter in pharmacies. And the restriction will apply only where the ailment is judged to be a minor, short-term problem. NHS bosses says the move could cut spending by a fifth. But experts warned the poorest risked losing out on treatment. While the new rules, which apply from April, allow doctors to issue prescriptions where for a long-term ailment or one related to a more serious condition, the Royal Pharmaceutical Society said those on low incomes could still end up being denied drugs ""because of their inability to pay"". And Andrew McCracken, from the National Voices patient group, urged GPs to use their ""medical judgement"" and prescribe treatments when people could not afford to buy them. The treatments targeted include those for: constipation athletes foot mild acne dandruff diarrhoea head lice cold sores earwax NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens said: ""Every pound we save from cutting waste is another pound we can then invest in better [accident and emergency] care, new cancer treatments and much better mental health services."" And Dr Graham Jackson, of NHS Clinical Commissioners, which represents local health managers, said unfortunately ""difficult decisions"" had to be made. The move follows a similar measure last year, which saw the NHS stop paying for things such as gluten-free food and suncream.

"Surge in Britons getting EU nationalityGermany gave citizenship to more Britons than any other EU country, data obtained by the BBC shows.UK Politics","There has been a surge in UK citizens acquiring the nationality of another EU country since the Brexit referendum, according to data obtained by the BBC. In 2017 a total of 13,141 UK citizens obtained the nationality of one of the 18 member states from which the BBC has received figures. This compares with 5,056 in 2016 and only 1,826 in 2015. The most frequent new nationality was German, which saw a huge jump from just 594 cases in 2015 up to 7,493 in 2017. One applicant, Paul Petty, from Bath, gained a German passport and is now a dual German/British citizen. ""I feel like Europe is pulling apart a bit at the moment,"" he told the BBC. ""I want to remain part of the EU."" More Britons became EU citizens in 2016 All you need to know about Brexit It took three weeks for Mr Petty to receive his new passport. He was eligible because of his mother's status as a Jewish refugee. He described the process as ""really easy"", as he still had his mother's passport. The rise is presumed to be the result of Britons who can meet the criteria seeking to keep their legal rights attached to European Union membership. The 2017 figure is about seven times the 2015 level. The dramatic increase is consistent across many countries.  France was the second most popular nationality, jumping from 320 instances in 2015 to 1,518 last year, and then Belgium, where the increase was from 127 to 1,381. The number for Ireland rose from 54 in 2015 to 529 in 2017. However, this does not include new Irish passport applications from the much larger number of people who already had entitlement to Irish citizenship, due for example to being born in Northern Ireland. Their new nationalities will guarantee the recipients the rights to travel, live and work throughout the EU after Brexit, and they may be able to pass these on to their children. In most cases those involved have also retained their British citizenship and so have become dual nationals. Lucy Hales has been living in Italy for five years, having previously spent 12 years in Spain, and plans to apply for Italian passports. ""It is likely that we will move to another European country, because of my husband's job, so having Italian citizenship would give us some certainty,"" she said. The BBC has obtained this data for 2017 from 18 of the 27 other EU member states. In the other cases it is not yet ready for publication. These 18 include most of the particularly relevant countries, accounting for over three-quarters of all such new citizenships in 2016. Only a limited proportion of British citizens would qualify for citizenship of another EU state. The bureaucratic process of applying can be slow and laborious. The criteria vary from one country to another and are sometimes complex, usually depending on ancestry and family links or residency. In the case of Germany, there is special provision for people whose German ancestors were victims of Nazi persecution. British citizens who fit a nation's requirements will still be able to apply after Brexit, although for some countries there may be complications. For example, Germany allows dual nationality only with EU states. Unless this changes Britons who become German after Brexit has happened could then find they have to renounce their UK citizenship.

US ambassador quits 'over Trump comments',"James D Melville is a career diplomat who has held senior posts in several European countries The US ambassador to Estonia is resigning, reportedly in frustration at remarks made by President Donald Trump about America's European allies. James D Melville said Mr Trump's comments on Nato and the EU had brought forward his decision to retire, Foreign Policy magazine reports. The magazine was quoting from a private Facebook post by the envoy. Mr Trump accuses Europeans of unfairly expecting America to shoulder the costs of the Nato alliance. He has also imposed trade tariffs on some EU industries. Other US diplomats left their posts early in recent months: In January,US ambassador to Panama John Feeley resignedsaying he was no longer able to serve under President Trump. A month earlier, Elizabeth Shackelford resigned from her post in Nairobi where she had worked for the US mission to Somalia, saying she was quitting because the US had abandoned human rights as a priority, Foreign Policy reports In the private Facebook post seen by Foreign Policy,external, Mr Melville reportedly told friends: ""For the president to say the EU was 'set up to take advantage of the United States, to attack our piggy bank', or that 'Nato is as bad as Nafta [the North American Free Trade Agreement]' is not only factually wrong, but proves to me that it's time to go."" Mr Melville is a career diplomat and took up his position as ambassador in Estonia in 2015 after being nominated by then President Barack Obama. Trump lashes out at key US allies US tariffs a dangerous game, says EU He had previously held senior diplomatic posts in several European countries and speaks Russian, German and French, according tohis biography on the US state department website,external. Nato has stepped up exercises in the Baltic states in recent years A state department spokesperson confirmed Mr Melville's intention to resign on 29 July. President Trump reiterated his criticism of fellow Nato members on Friday while on a flight from Washington to his private golf club in New Jersey. He told reporters on board Air Force One that countries including Germany, Spain and France had to increase their financial contributions to the bloc. ""It's not fair what they've done to the United States,"" he said. ""The United States is paying much more disproportionately to anyone else.""

Trump gets prank call on Air Force One,"President Trump spoke to a prank comedian while on board Air Force One US President Donald Trump was fooled by a comedian into taking a prank call while on board Air Force One. Comedian John Melendez posed as Senator Bob Menendez. He says he spoke to the president's son-in-law Jared Kushner and received a call back from Mr Trump. Mr Melendez said he claimed to be Senator Menendez and a fake assistant. ""Sometimes the [President's] channels are open too widely and mistakes like this happen,"" a White House official told CNN. Senator Menendez is a Democratic senator from New Jersey and a long-time campaigner for immigration reform. The US government has come under fire in recent weeks over its policy of separating migrant children from their parentsat the border with Mexico. Mr Melendez, who goes by the stage name Stuttering John, recorded his conversations with the US president and uploaded on his podcast. On the recording, the voice that is purportedly Mr Trump congratulates Mr Menendez for his 2017 acquittal in a bribery case. He was accused of accepting gifts from a Florida eye doctor in exchange for political influence. The two voices on Mr Melendez's podcast recording also talked about the Supreme Court vacancy following Anthony Kennedy's decision to step down next month. The voice said to be Mr Trump says he will nominate a new judge to the Supreme Court in ""10 to 14 days"". Trump narrows down Supreme Court candidates Why is the US Supreme Court so important? When the White House made inquiries with Mr Menendez's office about the conversation Mr Trump thought he had with him on Thursday, the senator's staff were befuddled, US media report. The prank caller said that his plan could have easily gone wrong. ""All they had to ask me is what party affiliation is Senator Menendez, or what state is he a senator of, and I would not have known.,externalBut they didn't ask me any of this,"" Mr Melendez told CNN. Tara McKelvey,White House reporter The prank call to the president made people laugh, and showed again the ramshackle nature of the Trump White House. I was flying with the president on Air Force One the night he took the call from Melendez, and I'm not surprised he got through. The fact that Mr Menendez was able to circumvent the president's aides makes sense, since they often don't know who he's planning to speak to. This president will see someone at a moment's notice, throwing his aides off guard. His unpredictable nature makes his days lively, but it also exposes him to risk and embarrassment. He seems to runs the White House like a reality show. Sometimes events come together, sometimes they don't. Speaking to a prankster was one that didn't turn out so well. But people will forget: soon he'll do something else unexpected, and they'll be talking about that. Late-night hosts unite against Trump Did comedian's Sarah Sanders 'roast' go too far?

Steel firms Thyssenkrupp and Tata to mergeThe UK's biggest steelworks at Port Talbot will become part of the newly-merged group.Business,"Tata owns the UK's largest steelworks at Port Talbot Unions have welcomed a merger between Tata Steel and Thyssenkrupp which will create Europe's second-biggest steelmaker. The deal will mean Indian-owned Tata's UK plants are merged into a pan-European venture, which includes the UK's biggest steelworks at Port Talbot. Tata said its ""ambition"" was to not have any compulsory redundancies in the UK as part of the joint venture. The steelworkers' union said the deal may secure jobs and lead to investment. Community general secretary Roy Rickhuss said it had ""the potential to safeguard jobs and steel-making for a generation"". But he also warned the venture would only succeed if there was strategic investment to make sure the business thrived. Merger means investment in Port Talbot blast furnace What's behind the Tata-Thyssenkrupp merger? Tata Steel UK's pensions deal approved German-owned Thyssenkrupp's supervisory board gave the go-ahead to the merger on Friday - the two companies have been in negotiations for more than a year. Between them, they employ about 48,000 workers. The merged group anticipates it will make costs savings of between Â£350m to Â£440m a year. When details of an initial agreement emerged last September, both sides said they expected about 4,000 jobs would go as a result of the merger, half from administration and half from production. In Wales, almost 7,000 people are employed by Tata, including at Deeside and more than 4,000 in Port Talbot. Tata: Turbulent year for UK steel industry Tata had announced in 2016 that it wanted to sell off its entire UK operations - before scrapping plans and optioning for a merger deal. Joe Lynam, BBC business correspondent This merger is a safeguard measure. It protects jobs rather than creates them. And it establishes a pan-European company - better able to face the rigors of world markets. No threat is more immediate than that of a growing tariff war initiated by President Donald Trump. His 25% tariff on all steel being sold in the US has created fears that steel from China, or elsewhere, might be diverted to Europe and sold below what is charged in its home market - a practice known as dumping. And then there's Brexit. When asked what impact that could have on the new Anglo-German firm, Tata Steel UK chief executive Bimlendra Jha said he needed to be able to easily move his products and people across borders. When asked what it would mean if the UK could not secure that outcome, he said that would be ""a sorry state of affairs"". Preserving 7,000 steel jobs in Wales was always going to be the goal, but political events on both sides of the Atlantic may dilute some of the benefits of this merger. While welcoming the deal, unions also wanted an end to uncertainty for workers. Unite union national officer Tony Brady said workers had ""made great sacrifices in working to secure a future for Tata Steel"". ""We will be seeking guarantees over jobs and investment for the UK operations of the joint venture to secure the future of UK steel,"" he added. Ross Murdoch, national officer of the GMB, echoed his comments. Thyssenkrupp chief executive Heinrich Hiesinger has previously said the two companies needed to consolidate and become more efficient because of increasing pressure from imports and an overcapacity within the industry. More recently, European steel makers have faced 25% tariffs on exports to their biggest market, the US.

"Dormant Oyster card Â£321m 'cash mountain'Transport for London should encourage customers to claim their money, a London Assembly member says.London","More than 100 million people have used Oyster cards since they were launched 15 years ago More should be done to remind Transport for London customers to claim Â£321m from ""dormant"" Oyster cards, a London Assembly member has said. Liberal Democrat Caroline Pidgeon accused Transport for London (TfL) of keeping ""incredibly quiet"" about the ""cash mountain"". TfL said it is ""committed"" to helping passengers get their money back. More than 100 million people have used the electronic travel cards since they were launched 15 years ago. More than Â£321m of balances and deposits are sitting on Oyster cards that have not been used for at least a year, TfL figures show. Contactless payments are thought to have contributed to a reduction in Oyster card use Ms Pidgeon, chair of City Hall's transport committee, put the ""soaring"" figure partly down to the number of people switching in recent years to making contactless payments with their bank cards. She said: ""TfL never stops bombarding us with advertisements and information campaigns, but highlighting this cash mountain is one issue that they remain incredibly quiet about. ""It is time TfL devoted far more time and energy telling the public how they can get their own money back."" Oyster cards can be used to pay for journeys by Tube, rail, bus, boat and cable car. The card system costs TfL millions a year to administer, while contactless payments are run by banks. Contactless payment grows in London Oyster card glitch leads to free travel TfL's chief technology officer, Shashi Verma, said people can reclaim their money ""whenever they wish"" from Tube ticket machines, at information desks or by calling the customer service team. ""We're committed to ensuring that our customers can get back the credit on their Oyster cards if that is what they want,"" he said. ""The Oyster card is an essential part of London and we're delighted with how popular this innovation has become in the last 15 years.""

Canada 'will not back down' over tariffs,"Canada will ""not back down"" in the face of new US tariffs on steel and aluminium, according to the country's foreign minister. Chrystia Freeland spoke as officials unveiled a C$2bn (US$1.5bn; Â£1.15bn) package to support the country's steel and aluminium industries. Retaliatory tariffs on C$16.6bn worth of US products are due to come into effect on 1 July. Ms Freeland said US tariffs left Canada ""no choice"" but to respond. Canada's tariffs target US steel and aluminium products. It also includes items such as yoghurt, ketchup and orange juice, which are made in key political battlegrounds such as Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Florida. Where does Trump's 'America First' leave Canada? G7 summit: Trump's Trudeau jibes bring Canadians and Americans together The list of products is intended to match ""dollar for dollar"" the US tariffs, which came into effect on 1 June, Ms Freeland said. ""Our approach is we will not escalate but equally we will not back down,"" she said. The US and Canada are among each other's top trade partners, exchanging nearly US$700bn in goods and services last year. But trade relations between the two countries have grown tense, amid disputes over issues such as lumber, dairy and wine. This video can not be played Dairy wars: Why is Trump threatening Canada over milk? The two countries, with Mexico, are also locked in negotiations over the North American Free Trade Agreement. In May, when the US said it would not extend exemptions from the tariffs to Canada and Mexico, it said those talks were moving too slowly. Ms Freeland said the discussions continue and will heat up again after the Mexican election on Sunday. She said she is confident that ""common sense"" will prevail. ""There's too much at stake,"" she said. The US is the top foreign market for Canada's steel and aluminium, while Canada is the destination for more than half of US steel exports. In Canada, the steel and aluminium industries employ more than 33,500 people, according to the government. About 6,000 jobs in Canada are at risk due to the US tariffs, the CD Howe Institute has estimated. President Donald Trump has complained about Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Twitter Ken Neumann, director in Canada for the United Steelworkers union, said the aid package, which includes loan assistance, should help companies, but the support for workers is more ""modest"". The package ""a good first step that will need to be expanded if the trade dispute continues beyond the short-term"", he said. The US is also exposed to thousands of potential job losses, as higher costs for steel and aluminium hurt US firms and trigger retaliation from Canada and elsewhere. In addition to Canada, the European Union and Mexico are among those that have announced tariffs on US goods in response. US tariffs: Allies retaliate with levies on jam, lamps and sleeping bags Who is losing out from Trump's tariffs? The Trump administration has said the tariffs are necessary to protect the steel and aluminium industries, arguing that their success is vital to America's national security. Several countries, including Canada, are challenging that rationale with complaints against the US to the World Trade Organisation (WTO). Where does Trump's 'America First' leave Canada?

UK heatwave: Lettuce shortage 'imminent',"There could be a shortage of lettuce in UK supermarkets as soon as the middle of next week, growers have warned. The unusually high temperatures have boosted demand for leafy salads at the same time as the heat has stopped the UK crop growing. Growers say they may have to import leaves from the US to make up the shortfall at a time when more than 90% of salad leaves is usually UK grown. Broccoli and cauliflower crops have also been affected by the weather. Trade body the British Leafy Salad Growers Association (BLSGA) said the ""soaring"" temperatures were causing ""havoc"" for growers. It said the last week a record 18 million lettuces had been sold, about 40% more than last year. However, it added ""when the mercury hits 30C lettuces can't grow"". BLSGA spokesman Dieter Lloyd said it ""looks entirely likely that there will be shortages"" from the ""middle to end of next week"". And one lettuce grower in East Anglia, who did not want to be named, told the BBC this summer had been ""very challenging"". Normally in good weather the crop grows rapidly, he said. But at the current temperatures the crop effectively stops growing because its ""under stress"". ""I think that if the weather keeps going the way that it's going absolutely we wouldn't be in a position to fulfil the demand that we're seeing with UK-grown produce,"" he added. At this time of peak demand more than 90% of UK leafy salads are usually grown in the UK. The grower had already looked to Germany to try to find alternative supplies, but with similar weather conditions there, farmers there did not have enough spare. ""If this goes on for another five days I wouldn't be surprised if we had to look to the US."" And it is not just lettuce that is affected, he added. Both broccoli and cauliflower crops have been hit by the weather as well. How to cope with the vegetable shortage Why is there a vegetable shortage?

DRC to drill for oil in wildlife parks,"Virguna national park is home to the critically endangered mountain gorilla The Democratic Republic of Congo government  is looking into whether to allow oil exploration in two protected wildlife parks, Virunga and Salonga. The move is strongly opposed by environmental activists, who say drilling would place wildlife at risk and contribute to global warming. Around one-fifth of Virunga national park could be opened to oil drilling. The parks are home to bush elephants, critically endangered mountain gorillas and the bonobo, an endangered ape. Both parks are Unesco World Heritage Sites, with Salonga national park covering 36,000 sq km (13,900 sq miles) of the Congo Basin - the world's second-largest rainforest after the Amazon. Gorillas, guns and guerrillas - a deadly mix in an African park DR Congo profile My daughter the gorilla The government has defended its right to authorise drilling anywhere in the country, saying in a statement that it is mindful of protecting animals and plants in the two parks. Virunga national park is considered the most bio-diverse park in Africa The cabinet said it had approved commissions charged with looking into whether to declassify parts of the parks, including 1,720 sq km (664 sq miles), or 21.5%, of eastern Congo's Virunga, the continent's oldest wildlife reserve. Earlier this year, park authorities decided to close the park famous for its volcanoes to visitors until 2019 aftertwo British tourists were kidnapped and a female park ranger was killed. The region has suffered rising instability and violence, with at least 12 rangers killed in clashes with armed groups and poachers in the past year. British company Soco International performed seismic testing therebut let its licence lapse in 2015. In total, 175 park rangers in Virguna national park have been killed in the line of duty since 1925 Correction 2 July 2018: This story has been changed to make it clear that the commission will decide whether oil drilling should be allowed.

Trump narrows down Supreme Court candidates,"President Trump spoke to journalists during a flight to his private golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey US President Donald Trump says he plans to announce his nominee for a new Supreme Court judge on 9 July. He told reporters on board the presidential aircraft Air Force One he had narrowed the choice down to ""about five"" candidates, including two women. The vacancy arose when Justice Anthony Kennedy announced his retirement earlier this week. It gives President Trump the opportunity to solidify a conservative majority on the top court. His nominee will need to be confirmed by the Senate where the president's Republican Party holds a narrow majority. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

During his campaign, Mr Trump promised to deliver ""pro-life"" judges to the Supreme Court - a prospect that has alarmed women's rights groups. Women fear abortion rights under threat Analysis: Why a fight over US abortion law looms Why is the US Supreme Court so important? ""I've got it narrowed to about five [candidates],"" he told reporters, adding: ""I like them all."" Mr Trump said he planned to interview one or two of the candidates over the weekend while staying at his golf club in Bedminster. Justice Kennedy, 81, is the second-oldest justice on the nine-member US Supreme Court. The court plays a key role in US society and is often the final word on highly contentious laws, disputes between states and the federal government, and final appeals to stay executions. In recent years it has expanded gay marriage to all 50 states, stopped President Barack Obama's immigration orders and delayed a US plan to cut carbon emissions while appeals went forward. Justice Anthony Kennedy will retire on 31 July Although a conservative, Justice Kennedy has sided with liberals on previous decisions, including the 5-4 rulings that decided same-sex marriage and upheld abortion rights. US media have reported several front-runners who could replace him: Brett Kavanaugh, who is at the top of most lists, is an appeals court judge in Washington DC and was a former clerk to Justice Kennedy Amul Thapar, a Kentucky judge handpicked by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and Amy Comey Barrett, a former professor at Catholic university Notre Dame, are both likely nominees Raymond Kethledge, a judge on the 6th US Circuit Court of Appeals and also a former clerk to Justice Kennedy, is another possible contender. Meet the Supremes - the nine judges on US top court In other remarks to reporters, President Trump said he would raise the issue of alleged Russian election meddling when he met President Putin in Finland on 16 July.

Review: Michael Jackson - On The Wall âââââ,"The first image you see when you walk into the exhibition at the National Portrait Gallery is the last portrait Michael Jackson commissioned of himself before he died in 2009. He didn't live to see the finished picture, but I think he would have liked it. It is by Kehinde Wiley, the American artist who, to much fanfare in February, revealed his official portrait of Barack Obama to the world. It depicted the ex-President sitting in a mahogany chair surrounded by foliage and flowers looking headmasterly. Wiley's Jackson portrait also sees the subject sitting, along with an equally stern expression and a smattering of decorative flowers. But there the similarities between the two paintings end. Equestrian Portrait of Philip II (Michael Jackson) by Kehinde Wiley, 2010 Barack Obama by Kehinde Wiley, 2018 Obama is presented as a quintessentially modern man, while the pop star is on horseback dressed like a medieval knight on a huge canvas that is a very direct riff on a 17th Century painting by Peter Paul Rubens of Philip II of Spain, as its title makes plain - Equestrian Portrait of King Philip II (Michael Jackson). Philip II on Horseback, 1629 - 1640, by Rubens It's not a patch on the original Rubens in terms of quality, but it is absolutely perfect for this freaky show, which takes a look at Michael Jackson's extra-curricular role as a muse for contemporary artists. Wiley typically makes paintings that place the ""black body"" into art history's almost exclusively white western canon. So, inserting Michael into Rubens' heroic painting of a Spanish monarch fits very nicely. As for Jackson, well, he had an insatiable taste for the baroque, which he sometimes sated with a shopping spree to buy some horrendously kitsch Louis XIV-type modern ornaments, or - as in this case - by developing a keen interest in the work of Rubens. It is the exhibition's most resolved alignment of the individual tastes and concerns of both artist and sitter - a piece of classically inspired pop art that became, during its creation, a fitting and poignant memorial portrait of perhaps the greatest entertainer of our time. According to Wiley, the full body armour the singer is wearing in the painting alludes to Jackson's public image and the way it ""functioned at once as communication and armour."" The fighting in the background refers to the battles he fought throughout his life: with his recently deceased father, with the media, with his own demons. The flowers are the beauty of creativity and music, while overhead, the cherubic figure of Victory holds a laurel crown to place on the head of the King of Pop. It is a fantasy world, like Neverland his 2,700-acre ranch in California, in which he could keep the real world at bay. It is a weird, sad painting, which in no way matches the subject's extraordinary creative and technical accomplishments but somehow sums up his life. It also sums up the exhibition, which is a very strange affair. Dangerous by Mark Ryden, 1991 It is not a chronology of Michael Jackson's life, nor does it seek to tell his story. It is just a gathering together of random contemporary artworks that are united by the simple fact that they depict the late singer in some way, shape or form. Actually, barring a few notable exceptions, they are also united by a lack of quality. Wall after wall is adorned with not very good art, some of which is by very good artists. Maybe they never intended their Jackson homage to be seen in public, maybe they were star-struck. I don't know, but when you walk round you'll see what I mean. There are some notable exceptions. King (A Portrait of Michael Jackson) by Candice Breitz, 2005 Candice Breitz's 16-channel video, in which we watch a line-up of 16 screens with each one featuring die-hard German fans singing their way through Thriller, track-by-track. Now That's What I Call A Portrait. And then there is Appau Junior Boakye-Yiadom's sculpture made out of 20-plus helium-filled balloons that butt up against the ceiling while the ribbons with which they have been tied lead to a pair of penny loafer shoes held up en pointe; balancing in the moment as Jackson did in his famous ""freeze"" dance move. P.Y.T by Appau Junior Boakye â Yiadom, 2009 Nearby is Time Can Be A Villain Or A Friend by Hank Willis Thomas. It is an appropriated image from a 1984 edition of Ebony Magazine, which shows an imagined version of how Michael Jackson might look like in the year 2000. At first, the fact that they got it so hopelessly wrong is funny, and then it isn't. Time Can Be a Villain or a Friend by Hank Willis Thomas, 1984/2009 The elephant in the room - or chimp, I should say - is that the curators were unable to loan any one of the three or four versions of Jeff Koons' famous sculpture Michael Jackson and Bubbles. That's a bit like not having Pele in the best ever Brazilian soccer team, or cutting a chapter out of Great Expectations.it leaves a big hole in the show. But despite that necessary omission (wittily acknowledged by the curators with a prominently displayed photograph of the sculpture by Louise Lawler, and a satirical take on it by Paul McCarthy) and a scrapbook feel of the display, it is an affecting exhibition. We bear witness to a sensitive, creative young boy becoming a commodity to be exploited: a Warholian product of popular culture whose soul is used like the fizz in bottle of Coke to add a little sparkle in the lives of thirsty consumers.

What makes the perfect World Cup penalty?,"What makes the perfect World Cup penalty? Who has the best record from the spot? And does luck really come into it? As the tournament enters the knockout phase we have a look at the history of World Cup shootouts, 26 of which have taken place since they were introduced in 1978 - though none were needed in Argentina that year. Of the 240 kicks at World Cup penalty shootouts before the 2018 tournament in Russia, 170 were scored - a conversion rate of just over seven out of 10. Of the successful penalties, the most popular location is low and to the keeper's left, according to data from football experts Opta. The worst penalty to take is low and in the middle area of the goal, with a success rate of only 58%. If a player does decide to hit his penalty straight down the middle, aiming high is the answer. No goalkeeper has saved any of the 15 World Cup shootout penalties struck high and centrally. In fact going for the top part of the goal is generally a good strategy, as Harry Kane demonstrated inEngland's group game against Panama, blasting both his kicks into the top left corner of the net. Opta's data shows that over 90% of penalties struck high and either side of the centre of the goal have been scored. But that approach carries with it the risk of missing the target altogether, as Italian forward Roberto Baggio discovered in the 1994 final,blazing his kick over the barto hand Brazil victory. Only about one in five penalties have actually been saved - 49 out of 240 attempts - with 28 goalkeepers responsible for those saves. The penalties saved have been shared almost equally to either side of the keeper, with 24 saves made diving to the left and 25 to the right. Twelve strikes have hit a post or the crossbar. With defending champions Germany eliminated in the opening stage for the first time since 1938, Russia 2018 is without the most successful penalty shootout team. Only one German, Uli Stielike in the competition's first shootout between West Germany and France in a 1982 semi-final, has ever missed in a penalty competition at a World Cup. Since then, Germany have scored 15 in a row and won all four shootouts they've been involved in. But given Germany's early exit, Argentina could overtake them as the nation with the most shootout victories. Lionel Messi may have missed from the spot against Iceland in the group stages, but his countrymen have a good record in shootouts, notching up four wins from five attempts. Their only loss came in 2006 to - surprise, surprise - Germany. At the opposite end of the scale, England have the worst record, something that will hardly come as a shock to anyone who has followed the national side. The Three Lions have lost all three of the shootouts they've been involved in, converting just seven of their 12 spot-kicks at World Cups. England's penalty defeat at the hands of Portugal in 2006 was one of the worst in terms of the percentage of penalties scored. The two sides managed to score only four spot-kicks between them out of a total of nine attempted. In that game, Portugal's keeper Ricardo saved three kicks, the most in a single shootout. Argentina's Sergio Goycochea and Germany's Harald Schumacher hold the record overall, having stopped four each. Mexico are another side with a poor record from 12 yards, having lost both their shootouts. Switzerland have arguably an even more ignominious record. They are the only team to have taken part in a World Cup penalty shootout and failed to score a single kick. Of the sides that have made it to the last 16 this time round, hosts Russia, Denmark, Croatia and Colombia have never been involved in a World Cup penalty shootout... yet. The penalty shootout is often referred to as a lottery, and luck actually comes into play even before the first player has struck the ball. As the current system stands, teams take turns in a shootout, with the choice of who goes first decided by a coin toss. Team A goes first, then team B, then team A again and so on. The side that wins the coin toss and decides to go first has an important advantage, with teams going first having triumphed 60% of the time. Researchers from the London School of Economics blamed the psychological pressure of 'lagging behind' for affecting performance. Teams going second in World Cup penalty shootouts have a 69% conversion rate, whereas the team going first have a 73% record. TheEnglish Football League has experimented with a new ABBAformat to try to address this. With this format, after an initial spot-kick, teams each take pairs of kicks in an attempt to reduce the pressure on the side taking the second kick in a shootout - but it will not be used at this World Cup. Penalties taken in a shootout are less likely to find the back of the net than those taken in regular play, according to research by Ben Lyttleton, football writer and author of a book on penalties. Lyttleton found that the conversion rate for penalties in open play in international tournaments and national cup competitions in England, Germany, Italy, Spain and the Netherlands over a 10-year period was 78%, compared with 74% in shootouts in the same competitions. Other than the additional pressure a shootout brings, this is potentially explained by the fact that players who may not be regular penalty-takers have to step up. And the pressure seems only to ramp up once the sequence gets under way. Historically the eighth penalty - of the scheduled first 10 - is the one that is missed most often in a World Cup shootout, with two out of every five attempts ending in a save or a miss. And if there is no winner after each side have taken five penalties, the shootout goes to sudden death, with pairs of penalties taken until one of the teams scores and the other doesn't. But that has happened only twice in a World Cup - in that first ever shootout in 1982 and in Sweden's quarter-final victory over Romania in the USA in 1994.

Virgin Atlantic stops forced deportationsThe move comes amid concern over the treatment of Windrush migrants and LGBT asylum seekers.UK,"Virgin Atlantic is to stop working with the Home Office on forcible deportations from the UK of people deemed to be illegal immigrants. The British airline says it has informed the government of its decision, saying it was ""in the best interest of our customers and people"". It comes amid concern over the removal of Windrush generation migrants and LGBT asylum seekers. Activists are urging other airlines to take similar action. Who are the Windrush generation? 40% of deportation flights cancelled Reality Check: Has the 'hostile environment' worked? Virgin Atlantic said: ""We've made the decision to end all involuntary deportations on our network, and have already informed the Home Office."" A spokeswoman declined to give details of the number of Virgin Atlantic flights or individuals affected. According to the Guardian,,externalVirgin has provided seats on its commercial flights to detainees and security officers accompanying them for many years. A charity in Jamaica that helps resettle deported people told the paper detainees regularly arrived on Virgin flights. Immigration Minister Caroline Nokestold Parliament last month,externalthe majority of enforced deportations used scheduled flights, where people sit alongside paying passengers. She also revealedthe government spent Â£17m,externalon such flights between 2016 and 2017 and Â£17.3m between 2015 and 2016. Activist group Lesbians and Gays Support the Migrants said Virgin told it of the move in response to a yet-to-be published open letter it has written highlighting the deportations of people to countries where they risked persecution. Sam Bjorn from the group added: ""The fact that the company has finally opted to break with this controversial practice testifies to a profound shift in public opinion on deportation since the emergence of the Windrush scandal."" The Windrush scandal hit headlines in April after it emerged that some migrants from Commonwealth countries, who were encouraged to settle in the UK from the late 1940s to 1973, were being wrongly categorised as illegal immigrants. They were part of what is known as the Windrush generation - a reference to the Empire Windrush - the ship that brought workers from the West Indies to Britain in 1948. Their treatment coincided with the Home Office's adoption of a ""hostile environment"" approach, designed to tackle the issue of illegal immigration, and so far, thedepartment has identified 63 people as having been possibly wrongly deported. Lesbians and Gays Support the Migrants wants British Airways and Qatar Airways - who also work on enforced deportations with the government - to end their involvement. Labour MP Stephen Doughty, who is on the Home Affairs Select Committee, has been questioning the government over its deportation policies and welcomed the move from Virgin Atlantic. He told the BBC: ""The whole system of detention and deportation appears to have serious flaws, not just for the Windrush generation, but other individuals who have been subject to wrongful detention - including one of my constituents. ""So it is a business decision for airlines, around their culture and ethics."" Asked if other airlines should follow suit, Mr Doughty added: ""If they want to facilitate this system that has a series of questions around its checks and balances... well, they may want to think about it again."" The airlines did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A Home Office spokesman said: ""We do not comment on operational matters.""

"Trump narrows down Supreme Court candidatesThe US president has five people in mind, including two women, and will name his choice on 9 July.US & Canada","President Trump spoke to journalists during a flight to his private golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey US President Donald Trump says he plans to announce his nominee for a new Supreme Court judge on 9 July. He told reporters on board the presidential aircraft Air Force One he had narrowed the choice down to ""about five"" candidates, including two women. The vacancy arose when Justice Anthony Kennedy announced his retirement earlier this week. It gives President Trump the opportunity to solidify a conservative majority on the top court. His nominee will need to be confirmed by the Senate where the president's Republican Party holds a narrow majority. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

During his campaign, Mr Trump promised to deliver ""pro-life"" judges to the Supreme Court - a prospect that has alarmed women's rights groups. Women fear abortion rights under threat Analysis: Why a fight over US abortion law looms Why is the US Supreme Court so important? ""I've got it narrowed to about five [candidates],"" he told reporters, adding: ""I like them all."" Mr Trump said he planned to interview one or two of the candidates over the weekend while staying at his golf club in Bedminster. Justice Kennedy, 81, is the second-oldest justice on the nine-member US Supreme Court. The court plays a key role in US society and is often the final word on highly contentious laws, disputes between states and the federal government, and final appeals to stay executions. In recent years it has expanded gay marriage to all 50 states, stopped President Barack Obama's immigration orders and delayed a US plan to cut carbon emissions while appeals went forward. Justice Anthony Kennedy will retire on 31 July Although a conservative, Justice Kennedy has sided with liberals on previous decisions, including the 5-4 rulings that decided same-sex marriage and upheld abortion rights. US media have reported several front-runners who could replace him: Brett Kavanaugh, who is at the top of most lists, is an appeals court judge in Washington DC and was a former clerk to Justice Kennedy Amul Thapar, a Kentucky judge handpicked by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and Amy Comey Barrett, a former professor at Catholic university Notre Dame, are both likely nominees Raymond Kethledge, a judge on the 6th US Circuit Court of Appeals and also a former clerk to Justice Kennedy, is another possible contender. Meet the Supremes - the nine judges on US top court In other remarks to reporters, President Trump said he would raise the issue of alleged Russian election meddling when he met President Putin in Finland on 16 July.

Steel firm Thyssenkrupp backs Tata merger,"Tata owns the UK's largest steelworks at Port Talbot Unions have welcomed a merger between Tata Steel and Thyssenkrupp which will create Europe's second-biggest steelmaker. The deal will mean Indian-owned Tata's UK plants are merged into a pan-European venture, which includes the UK's biggest steelworks at Port Talbot. Tata said its ""ambition"" was to not have any compulsory redundancies in the UK as part of the joint venture. The steelworkers' union said the deal may secure jobs and lead to investment. Community general secretary Roy Rickhuss said it had ""the potential to safeguard jobs and steel-making for a generation"". But he also warned the venture would only succeed if there was strategic investment to make sure the business thrived. Merger means investment in Port Talbot blast furnace What's behind the Tata-Thyssenkrupp merger? Tata Steel UK's pensions deal approved German-owned Thyssenkrupp's supervisory board gave the go-ahead to the merger on Friday - the two companies have been in negotiations for more than a year. Between them, they employ about 48,000 workers. The merged group anticipates it will make costs savings of between Â£350m to Â£440m a year. When details of an initial agreement emerged last September, both sides said they expected about 4,000 jobs would go as a result of the merger, half from administration and half from production. In Wales, almost 7,000 people are employed by Tata, including at Deeside and more than 4,000 in Port Talbot. Tata: Turbulent year for UK steel industry Tata had announced in 2016 that it wanted to sell off its entire UK operations - before scrapping plans and optioning for a merger deal. Joe Lynam, BBC business correspondent This merger is a safeguard measure. It protects jobs rather than creates them. And it establishes a pan-European company - better able to face the rigors of world markets. No threat is more immediate than that of a growing tariff war initiated by President Donald Trump. His 25% tariff on all steel being sold in the US has created fears that steel from China, or elsewhere, might be diverted to Europe and sold below what is charged in its home market - a practice known as dumping. And then there's Brexit. When asked what impact that could have on the new Anglo-German firm, Tata Steel UK chief executive Bimlendra Jha said he needed to be able to easily move his products and people across borders. When asked what it would mean if the UK could not secure that outcome, he said that would be ""a sorry state of affairs"". Preserving 7,000 steel jobs in Wales was always going to be the goal, but political events on both sides of the Atlantic may dilute some of the benefits of this merger. While welcoming the deal, unions also wanted an end to uncertainty for workers. Unite union national officer Tony Brady said workers had ""made great sacrifices in working to secure a future for Tata Steel"". ""We will be seeking guarantees over jobs and investment for the UK operations of the joint venture to secure the future of UK steel,"" he added. Ross Murdoch, national officer of the GMB, echoed his comments. Thyssenkrupp chief executive Heinrich Hiesinger has previously said the two companies needed to consolidate and become more efficient because of increasing pressure from imports and an overcapacity within the industry. More recently, European steel makers have faced 25% tariffs on exports to their biggest market, the US. ""The joint venture with Tata Steel is an important milestone for the transformation of Thyssenkrupp to an industrials and service group and will lead to a significant improvement of the financial figures of Thyssenkrupp,""the group said in a statement.,external It added that the ""signing of the definitive agreement is expected shortly"" and that the deal would be subject to clearance in several jurisdictions, including the European Union. Natarajan Chandrasekaran, chairman of Tata Steel, said: ""This is a significant milestone for Tata Steel and we remain fully committed to the long-term interest of the joint venture company. ""We are confident that this company will create value for all stakeholders."" The venture will create the second biggest steel firm in Europe after Arcelor Mittal. The new company, called Thyssenkrupp Tata Steel, would have annual sales of about Â£13bn and be based in the Netherlands.

NHS no to dandruff and diarrhoea treatment,"NHS England has announced a crackdown on the treatment of ""minor"" ailments such as dandruff and diarrhoea. Thirty-five treatments responsible for Â£570m of spending have been targeted. All are available over-the-counter in pharmacies. And the restriction will apply only where the ailment is judged to be a minor, short-term problem. NHS bosses says the move could cut spending by a fifth. But experts warned the poorest risked losing out on treatment. While the new rules, which apply from April, allow doctors to issue prescriptions where for a long-term ailment or one related to a more serious condition, the Royal Pharmaceutical Society said those on low incomes could still end up being denied drugs ""because of their inability to pay"". And Andrew McCracken, from the National Voices patient group, urged GPs to use their ""medical judgement"" and prescribe treatments when people could not afford to buy them. The treatments targeted include those for: constipation athletes foot mild acne dandruff diarrhoea head lice cold sores earwax NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens said: ""Every pound we save from cutting waste is another pound we can then invest in better [accident and emergency] care, new cancer treatments and much better mental health services."" And Dr Graham Jackson, of NHS Clinical Commissioners, which represents local health managers, said unfortunately ""difficult decisions"" had to be made. The move follows a similar measure last year, which saw the NHS stop paying for things such as gluten-free food and suncream.

The move is strongly opposed by environmental activists, who say drilling would place wildlife at risk and contribute to global warming. Around one-fifth of Virunga national park could be opened to oil drilling. The parks are home to bush elephants, critically endangered mountain gorillas and the bonobo, an endangered ape. Both parks are Unesco World Heritage Sites, with Salonga national park covering 36,000 sq km (13,900 sq miles) of the Congo Basin - the world's second-largest rainforest after the Amazon. Gorillas, guns and guerrillas - a deadly mix in an African park DR Congo profile My daughter the gorilla The government has defended its right to authorise drilling anywhere in the country, saying in a statement that it is mindful of protecting animals and plants in the two parks. Virunga national park is considered the most bio-diverse park in Africa The cabinet said it had approved commissions charged with looking into whether to declassify parts of the parks, including 1,720 sq km (664 sq miles), or 21.5%, of eastern Congo's Virunga, the continent's oldest wildlife reserve. Earlier this year, park authorities decided to close the park famous for its volcanoes to visitors until 2019 aftertwo British tourists were kidnapped and a female park ranger was killed. The region has suffered rising instability and violence, with at least 12 rangers killed in clashes with armed groups and poachers in the past year. British company Soco International performed seismic testing therebut let its licence lapse in 2015. In total, 175 park rangers in Virguna national park have been killed in the line of duty since 1925 Correction 2 July 2018: This story has been changed to make it clear that the commission will decide whether oil drilling should be allowed. We initially reported that oil drilling had already been allowed.

XXXTentacion reaches highest chart positionMany can't couple the rapper's music with the violent acts he committed during his life.,"XXXTentacion has scored his highest position in the UK's Official Chart, with his track Sad climbing up to number five. The 20-year-oldwas shot deadin his car in Florida on 18 June. Radio 1 didn't play XXXTentacion on its Official Chart Show, even though he currently has three songs in the UK Top 40: Changes (22) Moonlight (17) and Sad. The rapper has topped the US Billboard Charts since his death, amid a stream of tributes from huge stars including Kendrick Lamar, Kanye West andMeek Mill. His personal life - which is maybe better known than his music - makes him extremely controversial. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Listening to his music, he appears to open himself up and pour his heart and mind into his lyrics until he has nothing left. It's extremely dark - featuring themes of depression, loneliness, abandonment and suicide. The genre Souncloud rap doesn't quite sum his sound up - it's probably better described as emo rap. You can hear influences which include Linkin Park, Nirvana and his contemporary Lil Uzi Vert. Hislatest video,released after his death, shows him attending his own funeral. The family of XXXTentacion collects items from a makeshift memorial outisde his funeral XXXTentacion, real name Jahseh Dwayne Onfroy, was also unspeakably violent, controlling and abusive. He beat up his cellmate in juvenile detention because he suspected him to be gay. A year later, he was back in jail serving time for armed robbery and aggravated battery. Then in 2016, he was accused of abuse by his then girlfriend and faced charges which included aggravated battery of a pregnant woman and false imprisonment. How should he be remembered? As a young, troubled genius taken too soon, or as a violent abuser who didn't deserve his fame? It's an age-old question: Can we enjoy X's music while knowing what kind of person he was - can we separate the art from the artist? Radio 1 never had the Florida artist on its playlist. Spotify has gone back and forth on the issue. In May, the companyremoved artistsincluding XXXTentacion and R Kelly from its playlists under a new ""Hate Content & Hateful Conduct"" policy. In June, itbacktrackedon the decision after public criticism from artists including Kendrick Lamar and 50 Cent. After X's death, the streaming service started promoting his music, adding some tracks toRapCaviar,,externalan influential playlist. That again provoked a backlash from some users, who felt Spotify was capitalising on the artist's death. The indecision shows that the Art v Artist battle still goes on - even after the #MeToo movement. And it's not new. When X's team was approached by a New York Times journalist for comment over the Spotify decision in May, they replied back with a string of musicians who have historically been alleged of (and denied) abuse.

Deeper thought and reflection on who we put on a pedestal? XXXTentacion's horrific actions are obviously unjustifiable. But it's doubtful that these are what fans are identifying with - it's much more likely to be the gentle, emotional, open lyrics which are resonating. It may take a long time to come to a conclusion. But, if nothing else, the question of art versus artist deserves a lot of thought. Follow Newsbeat onInstagram,external,Facebook,externalandTwitter,external.
