H&M stores trashed over 'racist' hoodie,"South Africa's EFF party organised store takeovers at several H&M outlets South African police have used rubber bullets to disperse a mob trashing H&M stores in and around Johannesburg, after the brand used a controversial picture of a black child. The protests were organised by the radical Economic Freedom Fighters' party (EFF). H&M apologised several days ago for the image, which ran on its website. It featured a young black boy modelling a green hoodie with ""coolest monkey in the jungle"" written on it. The retailer withdrew both the product and the image after it sparked outrage and allegations of racismon social media. ""We're deeply sorry that the picture was taken, and we also regret the actual print,"" it said in a statement. The Weeknd cuts ties with H&M over advert Rapper G-Eazy ends partnership with H&M Video footage showed activists trashing displays, kicking over clothes rails and shoving mannequins. Floyd Shivambu, an MP from the EFF, tweeted: ""That @hm nonsense of a clothing store is now facing consequences for its racism. All rational people should agree that the store should not be allowed to continue operating in South Africa."" South African Police (SAPS) also tweeted about the vandalism, writing: ""Several incidents of protests at H&M stores around the province have been reported. ""At the East Rand Mall the protesters managed to enter the shop & stole several items. #SAPS members had to intervene and dispersed the group of protesters by firing rubber bullets."" EFF leader Julius Malema defended the rampage, saying: ""We make no apology about what the fighters did today."" ""We are not going to allow anyone to use the colour of our skin to humiliate us, to exclude us,"" he added. The Johannesburg branch of the EFF tweeted this picture While consumers in several countries had called for a boycott of H&M as the picture went viral, the mother of the child model has said that she did not find it offensive. She said the hoodie was ""one of hundreds of outfits my son has modelled"", and urged people to ""stop crying wolf all the time"". Addressing the EFF store takeovers, she tweeted that ""apartheid and racism [have] corrupted some so much that this is thought to be reasonable in response to a hoodie with the word ""monkey"" on it"". More than one celebrity has cut their ties with H&M over the hoodie row. Singer The Weeknd, who had collaborated with the company, said the advert made him feel ""shocked and embarrassed"". He was joined by rapper G-Eazy, who had been due to bring out a clothing line with H&M in March. ""I can't allow for my name and brand to be associated with a company that could let this happen,"" the musician said. ""I hope that this situation will serve as the wake up call that H&M and other companies need to get on track and become racially and culturally aware, as well as more diverse at every level.""

Czech president faces run-off votePro-Russian incumbent Milos Zeman wins the first round but faces a second round against Jiri Drahos.4h4 hours agoEurope,"Milos Zeman remains popular in rural areas The Czech presidential election will go to a run-off after incumbent Milos Zeman led the first round but did not secure enough votes to win outright. With nearly all results in, Mr Zeman had 39% ahead of his nearest rival Jiri Drahos on 26.3%. Turnout was 61%. Mr Zeman, 73, is seeking a second five-year term but has stoked controversy with his outspoken views and pro-Russian stance. The second round is scheduled for 26-27 January. The BBC's Rob Cameron in Prague says Mr Zeman appears to have done worse than expected in rural areas, where his forthright views on immigrants and political correctness have traditionally struck a chord. To avoid a run-off, he needed to secure more than half the vote. Mr Drahos knows he has a good chance of unseating Mr Zeman when the two men go head to head in two weeks' time, he adds. Many voters who chose one of the other seven candidates are likely to switch their allegiance to Mr Drahos in the second round. The politically incorrect president dividing a nation President Zeman has become one of the EU's most outspoken opponents of sanctions against Moscow and has also made improving relations with China a priority. Turnout for the first round was 61% Mr Drahos, a pro-European academic, has been forthright in his opposition to the president, saying: ""We say in Czech that 'the fish stinks from the head' and that perfectly sums up Mr Zeman's term."" The first round of voting, which took place over two days, passed uneventfully apart from a semi-naked protester who tried to disrupt Mr Zeman casting his vote in Prague on Friday and accused him of being in the pocket of Russian President Vladimir Putin. She was bundled away and Mr Zeman then cast his ballot, but was visibly shaken by the incident. Joined the Communist Party in 1968 during the ""Prague Spring"" but was expelled in 1970 for opposing Soviet intervention that crushed moves towards liberal reforms After communism fell he joined the left-leaning Social Democratic party and became leader in 1993 In 2013 he became the third president of the Czech Republic since it split from Slovakia in 1993 In his outspoken remarks on immigration he once said that Muslims were ""impossible to integrate"" into Europe Studied chemistry and technology and was president of the Czech Academy of Sciences from 2009 to 2017 He is a supporter of EU and Nato membership buts opposes the EU's quota system for distributing migrants, as do all other presidential contenders He considers himself a centrist politician who can unite the country His main support comes from pro-European voters and people living in cities The politically incorrect president dividing a nation EU to sue member states over refugees The Czech town trying to bury its Jewish past Billionaire candidate wins Czech election Firefighters running out of water as wildfire declared most destructive in LA's history In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?

Humphrys defends 'jokey' pay-gap chat,"Radio 4 presenter John Humphrys has defended off-air comments he made about the BBC's gender pay gap, describing them as part of a ""jokey"" exchange. The Today programme host told ITV News he had ""consistently"" spoken out in favour of ""equal pay for equal work"". Humphrys and North America editor Jon Sopel were recorded discussing colleague Carrie Gracie, who quit as China editor over ""pay discrimination"". The BBC was ""deeply unimpressed"" with the off-air chat, a BBC source said. During the exchange before Monday's show, the pair reportedly joked about ""handing over"" pay to keep Gracie in the role. Gracie had just quit because of what she said was pay inequality with her male counterparts - including Sopel - who were earning more than her Â£135,000-a-year salary. After transcripts of the conversation became public, BBC Woman's Hour presenter Jane Garvey tweeted: ""The Humphrys-Sopel exchange reveals, very neatly, what we're up against."" Watchdog asks BBC for Carrie Gracie facts Gender pay gap revealed at 500 UK firms Reality Check: What is the extent of the equal pay problem? Asked whether his comments showed he did not support equal pay, Humphrys told ITV News: ""That's complete rubbish, obviously that's complete rubbish."" He said the chat with his ""old friend"" Sopel had taken place at 04:00 GMT, ahead of a pre-recorded interview for Monday morning's edition of Today. ""We are in habit, Jon and I, of winding each other up and the purpose of this jokey - I emphasise jokey - exchange was a bit of mutual mickey-taking, and that is all it was,"" he said. ""If people took a different message from it, it could only be because they didn't appreciate that it was a joke."" He added: ""It has absolutely nothing to do with my views on women's pay, which I repeat and have said consistently should be equal - equal pay for equal work."" Humphrys said he had no idea the conversation was being recorded and the subsequent leak, first reported inthe Sun,externalandthe Times,externalnewspapers, was ""mildly annoying"". This video can not be played Carrie Gracie explains why she resigned as the BBC's China editor In an open letter abouther resignation, Gracie had accused the corporation of having a ""secretive and illegal pay culture"". Last year the BBC listed all the salaries of all employees earning more than Â£150,000 a year, which revealed Humphrys, who has presented the Today programme since 1987, had a salary of Â£600,000-Â£649,000. It showed Sopel, the US editor, earned Â£200,000-Â£249,999, while Middle East editor Jeremy Bowen earned Â£150,000-Â£199,999. At the time his salary was revealed, Humphrys said it was hard to justify, telling the BBC that the lower pay earned by his female colleagues on Today was not right and he was ""not happy"" about it. In their exchange, Humphrys reportedly asked Sopel about ""how much of your salary you are prepared to hand over to Carrie Gracie to keep her"". He then referred to ""other men who are earning too much"" at the BBC. Sopel is understood to have replied that ""if we are talking about the scope for the greatest redistribution I'll have to come back and say, 'well, yes Mr Humphrys but...'"" Allow Twitter content?

Austria rally over far-right in coalition,"Protesters carried posters reading ""don't let Nazis govern"" Protests have taken place in the Austrian capital of Vienna over the inclusion of the far-right Freedom Party in the new coalition government. Police said at least 20,000 people attended the rally, although organisers put the number at double that. Families with children walked alongside marchers chanting ""Nazis out!"", a BBC correspondent there reported. The Freedom Party's interior minister caused outrage earlier this week with his comments over asylum seekers. Herbert Kickl suggested that asylum seekers should be kept concentrated in one place, using a term associated with Nazi prisoners and death camps. The Freedom Party joined a coalition with the conservative People's Partyafter October's election failed to yield a concrete result. The People's Party's Sebastian Kurz is the world's youngest head of government; the Freedom Party has secured several key ministries, including the interior ministry. Saturday's march to Heroes Square in central Vienna was noisy but peaceful, reports the BBC's Bethany Bell. The crowd was made of students, left-wing organisations, families with small children and one group calling itself Grannies against the Right, she observed. A smaller protest took place last month when the coalition government was sworn in. Austria country profile Kurz and charisma: What propels young leaders to power?

'Chlorine attack' on Syrian rebel enclave,"Eastern Ghouta is under constant aerial bombardment (file picture) A chlorine gas attack has been carried out on a besieged rebel-held enclave on the outskirts of the Syrian capital Damascus, reports say. People in the Eastern Ghouta region, which is under daily bombardment, reported a smell of gas after a missile strike, the BBC has learned. Health workers said six people were treated for minor breathing problems. Some 400,000 locals have been under siege from Russian-backed government forces since 2013. There have been a number of reports of chlorine gas attacks since Syria's civil war broke out, but the government has always denied using chemical agents. On 10 January the UN's high commissioner for human rights said an upsurge in air strikes and ground attacks had killed at least 85 civilians in Eastern Ghouta since 31 December. ""In Eastern Ghouta, where a crippling siege has caused a humanitarian catastrophe, residential areas are being hit day and night by strikes from the ground and from the air, forcing civilians to hide in basements,"" Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein said in a statement. The Eastern Ghouta region is strategically important, as rebels based there are able to fire rockets into residential neighbourhoods of Damascus. This has also caused civilian deaths, according to state media. This video can not be played Children in rebel-held Eastern Ghouta are among those suffering Yusuf Ibrahim, a teacher who now lives underground in the rebel-held town of Harasta, just outside Eastern Ghouta, described the situation there. ""Today is not so difficult as it was yesterday because there are no warplanes or any raids till now, just heavy artillery bombardments ... like surface-to-surface rockets, which are targeting the buildings and the population in Harasta,"" he told the BBC. ""The inhabitants of the city are all underground, living in the basement or the cellars because of such heavy bombardment. ""There is no means of life such as markets or good services."" Last week,aid workers said at least 10 hospitals in rebel-held areas of Syria had suffered direct air or artillery attackswithin a 10-day period. An adviser to a coalition of medical charities told the BBC the attacks had been the most intense for a year. Why is there a war in Syria? Syria hospitals 'targeted by attacks' 'Critical point' in Syria's Eastern Ghouta Food shortages have led to many cases of severe malnutrition, and a UN report in November said some residents in Eastern Ghouta had been reduced to eating animal fodder and even rubbish. Several are reported to have died of starvation. Eastern Ghouta is one of several ""de-escalation"" zones in Syria announced by Russia, Iran and Turkey in 2017. Despite that, the area has remained under bombardment. Troops and allied militia have also shut many of the routes used to smuggle in food and medicine, leaving residents dependent on irregular aid deliveries.

Man dies after running to help robbed wife,"A 71-year-old man has died after running to the aid of his wife who was being robbed at a shop in Ayrshire. Police said the robbery happened at Wylie's Newsagent in Springvale Street in Saltcoats at about 15:40 on Friday. A man entered the store and threatened the 63-year-old shop worker with a knife before demanding money and fleeing with a small amount of cash. It is understood the worker's husband heard about the robbery and ran to the shop, where he collapsed. He was taken to Crosshouse Hospital, but pronounced dead a short time later. Police said the woman was uninjured but left very distressed. A post-mortem examination to determine the cause of the 71-year-old man's death is due to take place and a report will be submitted to the procurator fiscal's office. The suspect who robbed the shop is described as white, 5ft 8in tall, with a medium build. He was wearing a blue rain jacket with the hood up, blue jeans and a black scarf covering his face. Det Insp Fraser Normansell said: ""This was a very traumatic experience for the 63-year-old shop assistant who not only suffered the ordeal of the robbery itself but also witnessed the elderly man collapsing in the aftermath of the incident. ""It is vital that we trace the culprit and stop him from causing any further harm and distress and as such I urge anyone who was in the vicinity of Springdale Street in Saltcoats around 15:40 hrs on Friday 12 January 2018 and may have seen the suspect hanging around the area to contact police at Saltcoats immediately."" He added: ""I also appeal to any drivers who were in the area to check their dash cams as they may have captured the suspect on their camera. If so, I ask that they also contact police urgently.""

Bank account 'revolution' begins,"The move should boost technology companies offering money management A fundamental change to the way people can bank, manage and spend their money in the digital world is under way. A change in the law and the start of the Open Banking system means people can allow businesses, other than their bank, to access their financial data. Organisers say this has the potential for consumers to get better deals, such as cheaper overdrafts, and to speed up the switching process. But warnings over fraud risks have already been issued. As part of the same legislation, surcharges for payments made by credit card, debit card, or other payment systems such as PayPalwill be banned. Traditionally, banks have held all our information about our past transactions and spending habits. A change in UK law now means that banks and building societies must allow regulated businesses access to a customer's financial data, but only if the customer has given their permission. The bank can only block access if it suspects fraud or unauthorised access. The UK's Open Banking system should ensure that such access is given by the UK's nine biggest current account providers in a secure way, and without the need for customers to reveal their online banking login details or passwords. The main idea is that individuals can allow apps and online services to analyse their spending and find better deals on everything from loans and mortgages to shopping and broadband. Customers can give, and withdraw, permission at any time. Imran Gulamhuseinwala, trustee of the organisation overseeing Open Banking, said: ""It is difficult to overstate just how revolutionary open banking could, and should, be. New products will emerge from incumbents and entirely new entrants will join the market."" Examples of new services include: Money management apps that give tips and advice based on how your current account is used An app that monitors your balance and warns you if you are going overdrawn Third parties, such as a price comparison websites, analyse spending patterns and recommend products based on this, such as a cheaper overdraft, or a better credit card Source: Open Banking The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) told the UK's nine biggest current account providers to be ready to start Open Banking by 13 January. However, only four - Allied Irish Bank, Danske, Lloyds Banking Group and Nationwide Building Society - will be fully ready to begin. A maximum of six extra weeks of preparation time has been given to Barclays, Bank of Ireland, RBS and HSBC by the CMA. Santander-owned Cater Allen, which offers business accounts, has been given an extra year. Why banks will share your financial secrets Who do you trust after cash? Analysts and regulators expect consumer behaviour to change steadily over time. Surveys have suggested that most customers are reluctant to give out too much information about themselves. Only firms which are regulated and registered on a directory will be allowed to take part in Open Banking. However, NatWest, one of the banks ordered to be ready for the new system, has warned that fraudsters could mimic these firms to trick people into giving them access to their accounts. Such a fraud could leave consumers at risk of losing their money. New financial service providers are also expected to be targeted by hackers, although they must prove their robustness to regulators. Gareth Shaw, of consumer group Which?, said: ""Open banking has the potential to offer consumers more control of their finances and boost choice but it also comes with potential risks around data privacy and security. ""Regulators and industry must ensure that customers are properly protected from data breaches and scams, which is vital if consumers are to use these services with confidence and trust."" If a mistake is made by a regulated service using Open Banking, such as money going missing from an account, then a consumer should be compensated by their bank. If the fault is with a third party, then the bank must make a claim to that business. The changes surrounding access to financial data have been introduced as the EU's second payment services directive comes into force in the UK. The same legislation will bring an end to the extra cost added on at the end of the process of buying something online, such as a flight ticket, when using a credit or debit card, or being hit with a surcharge when using a card in a small shop. Card surcharges: Is this finally the end? The Treasury estimates that surcharging cost British consumers a collective Â£166m in 2015. The legislation also means bank and building society customers will have the right to a free, monthly, paper bank statement.

Diana and Dodi statue to leave Harrods,"Harrods' former owner Mohamed Al Fayed (left) unveiled the statue in 2005 A bronze statue of Princess Diana and Dodi Al Fayed is to be removed from the luxury department store, Harrods. It will be returned to the west London store's former owner and father of Dodi, Mohamed Al Fayed, who commissioned the memorial after the pair were killed in 1997. With the announcement of a new memorial at Kensington Palace, Harrods said the time was right to return the statue. Mr Al Fayad sold Harrods to the Qatari Royal family in 2010 for about Â£1.5bn. Unveiled in 2005, Innocent Victims depicts the pair dancing beneath a dove. Michael Ward, managing director at Harrods, said he had been proud to have welcomed people from around the world to see the memorial. ""We feel that the time is right to return this memorial to Mr Al Fayed and for the public to be invited to pay their respects at the palace,"" he added.

France demands UN protection for baguette,"Baguettes being judged during a Paris competition last April The French baguette should be listed as a Unesco cultural treasure, says France's President Emmanuel Macron. ""The baguette is the envy of the whole world,"" he said, in support of a national bakers' association that is promoting the application. The bakers have been inspired by the success of Italy's Naples pizza, which was protected by the UN's cultural body last year. Unesco's list aims to save traditions from globalisation. The Committee for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage meets annually to evaluate nominations from around the world. The bakers say it is not just the name and shape, but the recipe and ingredients that need to be enshrined. ""Excellence and expertise must be preserved, and that is why it should be heritage-listed,"" President Macron told French radio after receiving a group of master bakers at the ElysÃ©e presidential palace in Paris on Friday. Artisan breadmakers have voiced concern about mass-produced imitations. ""When I see the quality of bread in supermarkets, it is impossible not to get angry,"" Dominique Anract, president of the National Confederation of French Patisseries and Bakeries (CNPBF),told food website Atabula,external. ""The bread is frozen, some of it comes from Romania or who knows where, nothing is carried out in accordance of the rules of the art."" The traditional baguette is already protected in France by a 1993 law. To meet the criteria, the bread must only be made from four ingredients: wheat flour, water, yeast and salt. It cannot be frozen or contain added preservatives. Unesco's Lists of Intangible Cultural Heritage is different from its register of places, known as World Heritage Sites. Instead, this list focuses on traditions - mostly crafts, music, dance and cuisine. Yoga, Spanish flamenco and Tibetan Opera have already made the grade, as have Belgian beer culture and the gingerbread craft of northern Croatia. Naples is famed for ""pizzaiuolo"" - twirling pizza dough and baking it in a wood-fired brick oven France has already racked up multiple successful applications, from AlenÃ§on lace-making to French-style equitation. There is even a broadly termed listing for the ""French gastronomic meal"". That submission was centred mostly around the rituals that accompany the cuisine: how wines are paired with dishes, how the table is dressed, and the precise placing of glasses and cutlery. Pizza-twirling gets world heritage status The UK does not have any entries on the list. It is one of few countries in the world that has not signed up to the ""safeguarding intangible heritage"" convention, which was established in 2003.

Oarsmen 'smash' Atlantic rowing record,"This video can not be played George, Dicky, Stuart and Peter raised more than Â£250,000 for charity Four amateur rowers are believed to have set a new world record for the fastest crossing of the Atlantic Ocean. Friends George Biggar, Dicky Taylor, Peter Robinson and Stuart Watts spent 29 days and 15 hours at sea during the 3,000-mile crossing from the Canary Islands to the Caribbean. The men were met by family and friends in Antigua just after 02:00 GMT. They beat the previous Talisker Whisky Atlantic Challenge race record of 35 days and raised Â£250,000 for charity. The quartet will donate the money to mental health charity Mind, in memory of Mr Biggar's mother Anne Fisher who died aged 54 in 2011, and Spinal Research, in support of Mr Robinson's friend Ben Kende who suffered a spinal cord injury while playing rugby for Hong Kong in 2010. The four had to contend with sea sickness and 40ft waves Speaking moments after arriving in English Harbour in Antigua, Mr Biggar, 32, a property lawyer from London, said: ""It's amazing to complete the row. ""We set out with it as a charity initiative for two charities. ""For me personally, the Mind element is commemorative for mum who struggled with mental illness through her life. ""I always felt a need and desire to do something to commemorate mum, and to bring that to fruition and to complete it - to do it such justice in such style with such great support is amazing."" The quartet - who were known as The Oarsmen - were expecting to take 40 days to complete the row but families of the crew had to rebook flights to greet them as they progressed well ahead of schedule. The friends set off from La Gomera, in the Canary Islands, 29 days ago The previous record was set last year by Anglo-American quartet Latitude 35, in a time of 35 days. Mr Biggar, Mr Robinson, a 32-year-old farmer from Alnwick in Northumberland, Mr Watts, a 34-year-old account director from Gloucester, and Mr Taylor, a 32-year-old IT consultant from Corbridge in Northumberland, led the 25-boat fleet from very early on in the race. They battled sea sickness, 40ft waves, hallucinations and chronic fatigue, but had their spirits lifted through a chance encounter with a minke whale and a calf which swam underneath their 26ft fibreglass vessel in the middle of the ocean. Race organisers said they believed the quartet completed the fastest Atlantic row of all time, as well as in race history.

Comedy actress Bella Emberg dies,"Tributes have been paid to the ""huge comedy talent"" Bella Emberg, who has died, aged 80. The British actress will be remembered for her character Blunder Woman, the comic sidekick of hapless superhero Cooperman in the 1980s television programme The Russ Abbot Show. She was ""a woman of immense warmth and generosity"", Abbot said. Emberg also appeared on The Benny Hill Show, Z Cars and Doctor Who in a television career spanning six decades. ""She was not only a great sport but a huge comedy talent. I count myself very lucky to have worked alongside her,"" Abbot added. ""She really was a one-off."" In an interview with the Daily Mirror,externallast year, Emberg insisted the Blunder Woman character had been a blessing, not a curse, despite meaning that when the show finished in 1996 she could not get work. ""I went for jobs and they'd say: 'We'd love to hire you but you're too well known with Russ,'"" she told the paper. ""Once every few weeks I go and look at that Blunder Woman costume - still hanging up at home - and I feel nothing but gratitude."" Allow Twitter content?

Actor and comedian Barry Cryer, who was a screenwriter on the show, said Emberg was a ""joy to work with"". ""She never gave you the impression she was an obsessive, show business person. She took the job seriously and did it well but she was just completely natural away from the job,"" he said. Actor Les Dennis paid tribute to his ""funny, lovely friend"", while comedian Bobby Davro called her ""a true comedy talent"". Friend and pianist Bobby Crush described her as a ""truly gentle soul"". The ""funniest fairy"", comedy actor Paul Chuckle added, while her agent said she would be ""greatly missed"".

Facebook warned over revenge porn cases,"The legal case against Facebook was described as the first of its kind in the world A libel lawyer has warned that Facebook could face legal action from victims of revenge porn after the company reached an out-of-court settlement with a teenage girl in Northern Ireland. Paul Tweed said he had been ""deluged"" with inquiries afterthe settlement with the 14-year-old girl. She sued Facebook after a man allegedly posted a naked photo of her on a so-called ""shame"" page. Facebook has said it takes the issue of revenge porn seriously. It said it has developed tools to tackle the problem. In a statement, the company also said that ""for legal reasons, we are only at liberty to state that no judgement has been rendered in this case and that there has been no determination of any actual or potential liability for Facebook"". Facebook pays costs in naked photo case Humans to vet Facebook revenge porn pics The court was told that the case was the first of its kind in the world. The girl sued Facebook for damages, alleging misuse of private information, negligence and breach of the Data Protection Act. Following out-of-court negotiations, she agreed to a confidential settlement with Facebook, which included her legal costs. Facebook did not admit any liability in the case. Mr Tweed, who is based in Belfast, said the issue of revenge porn was a ""major social problem which, unfortunately, the law as it currently stands is not geared up to deal with"". Libel lawyer Paul Tweed said that revenge porn was ""destroying lives"" ""We're seeing considerable increase in the number of people that are receiving threats of publication of inappropriate photographs and images,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""The difficulty we have in these cases is that I would like to be able to say to them, 'look, there's not a chance that Facebook, or any of the social networking giants, will allow publication of such photographs or images'. ""I can't do that. And the difficulty here is that once publication has been made, it's often too late. ""In a matter of minutes, these images can be disseminated to thousands of people and, unfortunately, it has the net result of destroying lives."" By Amol Rajan, BBC media editor This legal case comes amid noisy debate about whether social media companies are platforms or publishers. The truth is they have elements of both and the debate over the legal obligations of these new kinds of company have often failed to keep pace with their own innovations. Nevertheless, the case of this Belfast teenager does seem to have opened up the possibility that current laws could be more widely used to obtain damages from the tech giant. Mr Tweed said that the two-year-long legal case illustrated the ""difficulty of bringing these cases where time is of the essence"". He added that Facebook had the technology to remove photographs, referring toa case in which the social media company removed an iconic image of a girl fleeing a Napalm attack during the Vietnam war on the grounds of nudity. Mr Tweed also said that a scheme trialled in Australia, which involves naked images voluntarily being sent to Facebook for removal, was not sufficient. ""Realistically, who is going to be comfortable sending the actual image that they are gravely concerned about to Facebook in those circumstances?"" Conservative MP Ed Vaizey, a former minister for culture and digital economy, said that politicians should not ""shy away"" from introducing legislation to deal with the issue. ""Facebook and a lot of tech companies have the power to combat these images and they need to act,"" he said. ""That's why, for example, Matt Hancock, the new secretary of state, talked about a charter of digital rights. ""More and more people are talking about the fact that social media companies have to take responsibility and, if not, there should be legislation and certainly recourse in court.""

Iran vents anger at Trump sanctions move,"The US strongly criticised Iran for a crackdown on recent anti-government protests Iran says the US has ""crossed a red line"" by imposing sanctions on the head of its judiciary, Ayatollah Sadeq Amoli-Larijani. The foreign ministry vowed to retaliate but did not say what form any action might take. Iran also rejected any changes to its nuclear deal with world powers. US President Donald Trump, a critic of the 2015 accord to prevent Iran developing nuclear arms, said he would extend sanctions relief one last time. However, the US imposed fresh sanctions on 14 individuals and entities over alleged human rights abuses. President Trump said he was giving Europe and the US ""a last chance"" to fix ""terrible flaws"" in the nuclear agreement signed by Iran and six world powers in 2015. The White House wants EU signatories to agree permanent restrictions on Iran's uranium enrichment. Under the current deal they are set to expire in 2025. Mr Trump also wants Iran's ballistic missile programme to be addressed. Is Trump going to kill Iran deal? Iran nuclear deal: Key details Although the US has suspended sanctions against Iran following the nuclear deal, it still imposes punitive measures over issues such as terrorism, human rights and ballistic missile development. The US Treasury issued a statement on Friday saying Ayatollah Amoli-Larijani was responsible for the ""torture or cruel, inhumane, and degrading treatment or punishment of prisoners,externalin Iran, including amputations"". It froze any assets he and the other individuals and entities on the list hold in the US, and ""generally prohibited"" Americans from engaging in transactions with them. Foreign financial institutions or individuals could also face sanctions for doing business with those blacklisted, the US Treasury added. The head of the Iranian judiciary had called for a crackdown on ""rioters"" and ""vandals"" following a recent spate of anti-government protests in Iranian cities. Iran has complained that US sanctions not connected to nuclear activity have effectively cancelled out any financial benefits it expected from the 2015 deal. Voices from Iran: 'We have the right to protest' Iran's foreign ministry accused Mr Trump of ""continuing to take hostile measures against the Iranian people and repeating the threats that have failed many times"". This video can not be played A timeline of what Trump has said about the Iran deal Iran, it said, would not accept any amendments to the nuclear deal ""now or in the future"" or allow any other issues to be linked to it. Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif accused the US of making a ""desperate attempt"" to undermine a ""solid"" deal. The accord signed between six global powers and Iran saw Iran agree to reduce uranium enrichment activity drastically, dispose of its enriched uranium stocks and modify a heavy water facility so it could not produce material suitable for a nuclear bomb. In return, decades of international and US nuclear-related sanctions were suspended. As part of an agreement with Congress, the president has to sign a waiver suspending the sanctions every 120 days. Mr Trump has repeatedly criticised the deal - reached under his predecessor Barack Obama - as ""the worst ever"". The waiver he will sign suspends sanctions for another 120 days but he warned that if a new agreement was not made, sanctions would not be waived again. ""If at any time I judge that such an agreement is not within reach, I will withdraw from the deal immediately,"" he said. US officials say the president will work with European partners to try to broker an agreement limiting Iran's ballistic missile activities. He was prepared to back a modification to the existing deal if it were made permanent, one official said. The president also wants the US Congress to amend a law on US participation in the nuclear deal, so that Washington can reimpose all sanctions if Iran breaches certain ""trigger points"". This would involve negotiations between the US and its European allies rather than talks with Iran, the official said. Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister, Sergei Ryabkov, described Mr Trump's comments as ""extremely negative"". Germany has said it will continue to call for the deal's full implementation and will consult on a ""common way forward"" with the UK and France. French President Emmanuel Macron phoned Mr Trump on Thursday to call for ""the strict application of the deal and the importance of all the signatories to respect it"".

What staff and patients think of the NHS,"The NHS has been under the spotlight even more than usual over the Christmas period, with hospitals described as unsafe and overcrowded. Doctors say patients aredying in corridors, and are asking for money for beds and staff. Newsbeat asked for your experiences at hospitals and was inundated with responses. They were raw - but gave positive as well as negative accounts. Texts and voice messages from hospital workers said similar things, with ""overworked"" and ""exhausted"" common phrases. One doctor, who wished to remain anonymous, said they'd sent their message ""through tears"" on the way home from a third 13-hour shift in a row. ""I'm sending this text after staying two-and-a-half hours late, after the whole team volunteered to stay and complete an overbooked theatre list of patients who had already been cancelled once during the last few weeks due to winter pressures,"" they wrote. They put their tears down to guilt - ""because I am examining my patients in inadequate areas, because they are losing their dignity"" - as well as feeling selfish for wondering whether they're paid enough to deal with it all. ""We are people too. I shouldn't be driving home in tears because I am dreading tomorrow,"" they wrote. ""The only thing that will help me get up and get me in the car are my patients."" Laura says staff go home ""exhausted and demoralised"" Laura, who has worked in the NHS for 15 years, said she's ""seen the service decline steadily"" - and working 13-hour shifts without a break is becoming ""commonplace"" in hospitals. ""It's impacting massively on patient care. Staff are overworked, they're trying to bridge the gap between underfunding, understaffing, and an increase in the population,"" she says. ""This altogether results in unsafe and unethical care."" A 22-year-old nurse in her final year of training, who wished to remain anonymous, also worries that patients are suffering. ""There's often staff off sick because of stress or other issues related to that, and the hospital can't really manage to fill shifts so patients aren't priority anymore,"" she said. James Chambers had a positive experience in hospital this Christmas, his brother says On Christmas Day, James Chambers was rushed to hospital by air ambulance after a ""massive cardiac arrest"". His brother Phil had nothing but positive words to say about the doctors and nurses that treated him. ""He was given a minus 50% chance of surviving,"" he said. James was recently discharged from hospital with a defibrillator. ""The level of care given by the medical professionals was absolutely exemplary,"" Phil added. Ashley from Derby had similar things to say following a recent two-week stay in hospital. ""All of them treated me with respect and with the best care possible,"" he said.

ANC leader urges unity as Zuma booed,"Mr Ramaphosa's speech in East London targeted corruption and the economy Cyril Ramaphosa, the new leader of South Africa's ruling ANC, has said the party must address the ""dysfunction"" in its ranks and unite at all levels. Mr Ramaphosa told a large rally in the south-eastern city East London that the party had become deeply divided through factionalism, patronage and corruption. He was elected to replace President Jacob Zuma as party head last month. But Mr Ramaphosa did not address calls to immediately replace the president, who was booed as he took his seat. Mr Zuma's term in office is not scheduled to end until elections in 2019. Profile: Cyril Ramaphosa Will Zuma be ousted as South Africa's president? Can South Africa avoid doing a Zimbabwe on land? However, the ANC has seen public support decline during his second term, amid a weakening economy and allegations of corruption. Mr Ramaphosa was addressing a rally to mark 106 years of the ANC. The BBC's Andrew Harding says the new ANC leader did not criticise Mr Zuma by name but the implication was clear when he condemned corrupt families and individuals. The suspicion remains, our correspondent says, that Cyril Ramaphosa and his allies in the ANC may soon move against South Africa's embattled leader. President Zuma has been embroiled in a series of corruption scandals - he denies any wrongdoing. The leadership battle caused fierce political infighting, raising fears of a party split before the 2019 election. In his speech Mr Ramaphosa vowed to ""confront people who are trying to divide the ANC"", calling for unity, renewal and a change of culture. Jacob Zuma, who has been beset by corruption accusations, was booed in East London He urged ""the creation of a united, non-racial, non-sexist, democratic, prosperous and equitable society"". Much of the speech was targeted at corruption and the economy. He said he wanted people in the ANC who sought ""no advantage for themselves or their families"", adding: ""We are going to confront corruption in all its forms. Investigation of those responsibility will be given top priority."" He issued a plea for foreign investment and vowed to build ""an economy which benefits the people of our country as a whole rather than just benefit a few privileged individuals and families"". Mr Ramaphosa vowed to pursue the ""expropriation of land without compensation"" as agreed at the party conference. But he cautioned it would be done in a manner that ""does not impede economic development and agricultural production"". The ANC has been under pressure to redress disparities which mean white farmers still own much of the best land in South Africa, more than two decades after the end of apartheid.

More children having teeth out in hospital,"Dentists have accused the government of having a ""short-sighted"" approach to tooth decay in England after hospital operations to remove children's teeth increased to nearly 43,000. There were 42,911 operations in 2016-17 - up from 40,800 the previous year and 36,833 in 2012-13, NHS figures show. The British Dental Association said England had a ""second-class"" dental service compared to Wales and Scotland. The government said it was ""determined"" to reduce the number of extractions. Doctors said many of the tooth extractions would be caused by the food and drink children consume and were therefore ""completely preventable"". Dental surgeon Claire Stevens, who works in a hospital in north-west England, said most of her patients were aged five to nine, but it was not uncommon to remove all 20 baby teeth from a two-year-old because of decay. She said she has also extracted a 14-year-old's permanent teeth due to fizzy drinks. They then needed false teeth. An analysis of NHS figures by the Local Government Association, which represents councils in England and Wales, found the equivalent of 170 hospital tooth extractions a day were being carried out on under-18s. These are done in hospital under general anaesthetic, rather than at a dental practice. The operations would have cost the NHS about Â£36m last year and Â£165m since 2012, the LGA found. Kellogg's to cut sugar in kids' cereals Sugar targets set for cakes and chocolate What is the UK's most sugary drink? Mick Armstrong, chairman of the BDA, said: ""These statistics are a badge of dishonour for health ministers, who have failed to confront a wholly preventable disease. ""Tooth decay is the number one reason for child hospital admissions, but communities across England have been left hamstrung without resources or leadership."" This video can not be played Dental surgeon Claire Stevens says it's not uncommon to remove all 20 baby teeth in a two-year-old The BDA said England was receiving a ""second-class service"" because, unlike Wales and Scotland, it has no dedicated national child oral health programme. It said the government's centrepiece policy Starting Well - aimed at improving oral health outcomes for ""high-risk"" children - had received no new funding and was operating in parts of just 13 local authorities in England. ""The BDA has insisted that national authorities must provide resources to enable all children in England to benefit,"" it said. The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health said the figures were ""startling"" and ""should act as a wake-up call to policy makers and act as the catalyst for change"". The LGA said the data demonstrated the ""urgent need to introduce measures to curb our sugar addiction which is causing children's teeth to rot"". The Royal College of Surgeons said the statistics were ""alarming"" and called for supervised tooth brushing sessions in all nursery schools across England. This video can not be played People use circular motion, horizontal, rolling or vibratory techniques to clean their teeth, but which is the right way? A Department of Health and Social Care spokeswoman said it was ""determined to reduce the number of children having teeth extracted because of tooth decay"" and pointed to its sugar tax, which comes into effect in April on soft drinks with the most added sugar. ""Our world-class NHS dentists are also playing a vital role to improve dental hygiene - in the last year 6.8 million children were seen by a dentist, representing 58.5% of the child population,"" she said. The spokesman added that the Starting Well programme was introduced last year to improve the oral health of children most at risk in 13 high priority areas and NHS England was planning to expand the programme to other areas. Dr Sandra White, director of dental public health at Public Health England, said parents could reduce tooth decay through cutting back on their children's sugary food and drink and encouraging them to brush their teeth with fluoride toothpaste twice a day, as well as regular trips to the dentist. Government initiatives in Scotland and Wales are said to be behind their falling rates of tooth decay in young children. In Scotland, the Childsmile programmeis claimed to have cut Â£5m off treatment costs andthe Designed to Smile programme in Waleshas helped reduce decay among five-year-olds in deprived areas. A debate on children's dental examinations and treatment is due to take place in the House of Lords on 18 January. Follow Alex onTwitter,external.

"Review: Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri âââââ","Cast your mind forward a few weeks to the Dolby Theatre on Hollywood Boulevard at around 8pm (PST), Sunday 4 March. Somebody, probably dressed in black with very good teeth, will be opening a golden envelope while simultaneously saying these words: ""The Oscar for best actress in a leading role goes toâ¦"" He or she will then pause for dramatic effect, pull out the card and sayâ¦ ""Frances McDormand! -  for Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri."" This will happen. Her only serious competition comes from Sally Hawkins as the amphibian-loving janitor in Guillermo del Torro's fabulous film The Shape of Water, but McDormand edges it for giving life to the remarkable Mildred Hayes; a kick-ass, boiler-suited, bandana-wearing working class woman with a broken heart and a raging soul. Frances McDormand stars as a mother (Mildred Hayes) seeking justice for her daughter's unsolved rape and murder Mildred is an uncompromising, unflinching, and unappeasable big character from a small town who is destined to become one of cinema's great tragic lone-heroes. She is not a vigilante, or a cop, or an ex-soldier. She is not tooled-up with lethal weapons nor is she a high-kicking exponent of the martial arts. Her armoury is much scarier. Mildred Hayes is a furious, intelligent, grieving, middle-aged mother with the nihilistic courage of someone for whom consequences are inconsequential. She's numb on the outside and dead within. A little while back she had a silly argument with her teenage daughter about going out. In that tough-love, no-nonsense way of hers she said things she shouldn't have, like 'I hope you get raped'. Her daughter got raped. And was then set alight. And then murdered. As you can imagine, it devastates Mildred. Wrongs have to be righted. She needs closure. The killer must be found. Frustratingly for her, the police are taking a more laid back approach. They are less het up about things. So, having made a few enquiries to no avail they revert to their small-town ways, which Mildred describes as ""goin' 'round torturing black folks."" What choice does she have other than to take matters into her own hard-skinned hands? She rents three disused, dilapidated billboards on the Drinkwater Road just outside the fictional town of Ebbing, Missouri and places the following message on them in huge black letters set against a blood-red background: Billboard 1: RAPED WHILE DYING. Billboard 2: AND STILL NO ARRESTS? Billboard 3: HOW COME, CHIEF WILLOUGHBY? And with that the film is set-up. What follows is one of the finest black comedies I have seen this century. Sam Rockwell (Officer Dixon) and director/writer Martin McDonagh on the film set Anyone who has watched the plays The Lieutenant of Inishmore or The Pillowman knows Martin McDonagh is a writer of rare wit and virtuosity. If you've seen In Bruges you'll know he can direct too. But he takes the two art forms to another level in Three Billboards, which he wrote specifically for Frances McDormand. She is not the only star of the show. Woody Harrelson is terrific as Ebbing's revered Police Chief Willoughby who tries playing the 'but I'm dying of cancer' compassion card on Mildred, who promptly trumps it by suggesting he uses his terminal condition as a motivation to get her daughter's case solved sooner rather than later. Woody Harrelson as Sheriff Willoughby, who is sympathetic to Mildred's search for the truth Dixon is Willoughby's dim-witted, racist, violent mummy's boy of a junior officer. In the wrong hands the character would be little more than a two-dimensional cartoon thicko - a sort of Beavis and Butthead rolled into one bigoted, bullying buffoon - but Sam Rockwell manages to mine Dixon's shallows and successfully find his humanity and humility. Sam Rockwell as dim-witted and racist Officer Dixon John Hawkes as Mildred's ex-husband Charlie is the one person she cannot overcome with her brooding fury. He adds an extra layer of oily darkness to an already very black comedy with his cheap put-downs - ""you don't have to explain yourself to me 'cause you're having dinner with a midget, Mildred"" (she was) - and heartless jibes glibly tossed into her open wound of guilt. He can get away with taking her on; after all, he has lost a daughter too. But the same does not apply to the cocky schoolboy who lobbed a projectile at her car. He won't be doing that again. He'll be telling his friends the same thing I am telling mine: make sure you look out for Mildred Hayes. She's something else. As is this film, which captures the insular nature of life in a rural community with heart and soul and humour. It's a very well written, beautifully shot, expertly told story: it is a modern classic.

Carillion's uncertain future,"Carillion worked on the Battersea Power Station revamp Being a big engineering contractor is a risky business. To get the big contracts, you have to promise to deliver on time and on-budget and if you don't, you end up eating the cost of the overruns. In the case of Carillion a hospital in Liverpool, a road in Aberdeen and a tramway in Sheffield turned sour. When you have a lot of debt those risks get amplified and when you also recognise future revenue before you know how well the contract is going to go, your balance sheet can begin to look pretty weak, pretty quickly. That's where Carillion finds itself. Â£1.5bn in debt, a pension fund Â£580m in the red, losing money and facing investigations about whether it misled markets about the real weakness of the company. So how does it get out of this mess? Tricky. The shareholders of the company should be kissing any value goodbye. Why the shares have any value at all (currently worth Â£75m in total) is hard to understand. Its lenders are now in control and could force the company into administration at any time. They have already agreed to postpone a key test of the company's finances until April but are balking at putting any new cash into the company for fear of throwing good money after bad. Normal procedure would be to give the company's creditors - the banks and the pension scheme mainly - shares in lieu of the debt they are owed and allow the company to carry on in the hope that its value will recover. Next stop would normally be administration, when contracts and equipment would be sold off piecemeal to offset some of the losses incurred by the lenders and the short-changed pension fund. Carillion is the UK's second largest construction firm and employs 43,000 people globally The Pensions Regulator will be keen that the pension scheme gets its fair share of that fire sale to address the pension deficit before the 28,000-member scheme is lowered into the industry-wide pension lifeboat scheme. But this is not a normal company. Its tentacles reach into the delivery of very sensitive services. School, hospital and prison maintenance alongside big infrastructure projects. Banks consider paying for EU access UK plans to soften impact on European banks If it does go into administration, and advisors at EY are reportedly standing by - claims the firm denies - it will create an enormous headache for the government. One so painful the government may be forced to temporarily nationalise parts of the business. I'm told that there are plans in hand to do just that with the contract to run the prisons. The railway piece should be relatively straightforward. In situations where Carillion is, for example, one third of a consortium to supply services, its role will be assumed by the other two contractors and the staff involved will swap one hi-vis vest for another without too much disruption. In situations where it is sole contractor, the work may be taken in house by Network Rail in much the same way that Transport for London did when the contractor Metronet went bust. Where real pain may be felt could be among the army of subcontractors that provide supplies and services to Carillion and rely on them for payment. Many of these will be small and medium sized businesses for whom payment delays or failures could present an existential threat. Falling into administration could also do serious damage to the whole idea of outsourcing critical services to private companies. Unions and the Labour party seized on the company's plight to question the wisdom of awarding sensitive contracts to debt laden and, until recently, dividend-paying private firms. Full nationalisation of the company seems very unlikely but the government has stepped in before on a temporary basis to take on private contracts - when it nationalised the East Coast Main Line briefly (and profitably) between 2009 and 2015. Is Carillion too big, too sensitive to fail? No. Will the government bend over backwards to stop that? It depends how far it has to bend. Where did it go wrong for Carillion?

Urgent talks on construction firm's future,"The future of troubled engineering company Carillion is being discussed at high-level government meetings this weekend, the BBC understands. The firm is a key government contractor for projects including the HS2 high-speed rail scheme, schools and prisons. Sources say the firm has a ""matter of days"" as it teeters on the edge of collapse, with Â£1.5bn of debt including a pension shortfall of Â£587m. Carillion is trying to reach an agreement with creditors. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable said the government must not bail out the struggling construction company, the second largest in the UK. Sir Vince, a former business secretary, told BBC Breakfast: ""They've got to force the shareholders and indeed the creditors, the big banks, to take losses, and then the government can take responsibility for taking the contracts forward and making sure they are delivered."" Simon Jack: Carillion's uncertain future Where did it go wrong for Carillion? Jon Trickett, shadow minister for the Cabinet Office, called on the government to take contracts back into public control, describing its relationship with the Carillion as a ""failing ideological project"". ""It has been clear for months that Carillion has been in difficulty but the government has continued to hand over contracts to the company,"" he said. In 2016 the Wolverhampton-based company, which employs 43,000 people globally, had sales of Â£5.2bn and until July boasted a market capitalisation of almost Â£1bn. But since then its share price has plummeted and it is now valued at about Â£61m. Officials from the justice, transport and business departments will gather this weekend for a meeting chaired by the Cabinet Office. The consultancy EY has been put on notice in case the company falls into administration. On Friday, reports that creditors had rejected a potential rescue plan sent Carillion's shares down by more than 28%. By BBC business correspondent Joe Lynam A decade ago the government bailed out the banks because - being central to the workings of the entire economy - they were ""too big to fail"". Now the same issue of moral hazard arises for the engineering giant Carillion. If it collapses, what happens to politically sensitive work that it does, such as building hospitals and running schools, jails or Ministry of Defence facilities? Pausing that work until new contracts are tendered, bid for and awarded would take years. But bailing out a private company like Carillion, which paid out dividends to its shareholders last year, won't play well with taxpayers. So Carillion will either have to restructure its debts within days with its now impatient banks or file for administration and hope that EY can find a solution which is quick, clever and doesn't cost jobs. This video can not be played Bailing out Carillion 'would send the wrong message', Vince Cable says. But in Friday's statement, Carillion said: ""Suggestions that Carillion's business plan has been rejected by stakeholders are incorrect."" It said the firm remained in constructive dialogue about short-term financing while ""longer term discussions are continuing"". The government has said it is ""monitoring the situation closely"". A government spokeswoman said: ""Carillion is a major supplier to the government with a number of long-term contracts. We are committed to maintaining a healthy supplier market and work closely with our key suppliers."" The BBC understands that the Ministry of Justice has drawn up plans to bring Â£200m of prison contracts run by Carillion back into public control. Carillion, which was founded in the late 1990s as a spin-off from building giant Tarmac, also operates in Canada, the Middle East and the Caribbean. It has worked on key projects overseas including the Suez Canal road tunnel and Toronto's Union Station. It is also the second largest supplier of maintenance services to Network Rail. The general secretary of the RMT rail union, Mick Cash, said the government should give Carillion's workers ""clear-cut assurances"", as thousands of jobs were ""hanging by a thread"". It also wants an assurance that operations would be directly transferred over to Network Rail if Carillion goes bust. Where did it go wrong for Carillion?

Is Trump killing Iran deal?,"Protesters in LA calling on the US to reject the deal in 2015 President Donald Trump has extended sanctions relief for Iran one last time, says the White House. What does it mean? The announcement puts a question mark over the future of the nuclear accord signed by Iran and six world powers in 2015. The pact lifted economic sanctions in exchange for Tehran limiting its nuclear ambitions. President Donald Trump was fiercely critical of the deal during his election campaign, and refused to certify it in October. European powers have repeatedly urged the US not to abandon the agreement. So why are they worried? Iran nuclear deal: Key details US 'to impose new Iran sanctions' For years, economic sanctions were imposed by the US on Iran to try to curb its nuclear programme. These measures cut Iran off from the global financial system. Under the nuclear deal, known as the JCPOA, the US agreed to lift the sanctions by issuing executive waivers. The White House has to verify to lawmakers that Iran is still in compliance with the terms of the agreement in order to keep the nuclear deal afloat. To do this, it has been withholding the re-imposition of these sanctions. This comes through an executive waiver issued by the president. US law pertaining to the Iran nuclear deal, passed during the Obama administration, requires the White House to acknowledge Iran's compliance with the deal every 90 days. It was a way for Republicans - who were opposed to the deal - to keep a check on President Obama and US participation in the accord. These compliance conditions have rankled with Republican President Donald Trump, who campaigned against the deal. Mr Trump has just extended the sanctions relief, but a senior administration official said ""this is the last such waiver he will issue"". The White House wants European powers to impose permanent restrictions - currently set to expire in 2025 - on Iran's uranium enrichment. Mr Trump also wants Iran's ballistic missile programme addressed. How sanctions have hit ordinary Iranians What are the UN sanctions on Iran? Recertification of the nuclear deal is a two-part process. Verifying that Iran is in compliance with the nuclear deal is part of it. However, the second part involves the White House certifying that the nuclear deal remains in the US national security interest. The original agreement was forged between Iran and the five permanent members of the UN Security Council, plus Germany. On the campaign trail in 2016, candidate Trump repeatedly pledged to tear up the Iran deal if elected. But since taking office, he has kept the accord alive by issuing the sanctions waivers. He has not, however, said the deal is in the US national interest. In October 2017, Donald Trump decertified part of the deal on these national security grounds. This did not amount to quitting the accord. The president kicked the fate of the agreement to Congress, demanding that lawmakers ""address the deal's many flaws"" by legislating tougher terms. Congress had 60 days to do this, a time Mr Trump called the ""snapback window"". That deadline has passed. The accord was announced to great fanfare in 2015 The Republican-controlled House would easily walk away from the JCPOA. But the ratio of Democrats to Republicans in the Senate makes this not so easy: Republicans have a narrow majority - 51 to 49. If Trump again does not re-certify the deal then that reopens the so-called snapback window and again Congress would be in charge of coming up with negotiated terms for a revised deal. If they cannot reach an agreement, Congress could end the US role in the JCPOA. In the House, a majority is required and in the Senate, Leader Mitch McConnell could introduce expedited legislation, bypassing the committee process - and go straight to the floor for a vote. Fifty-one votes are required to pass the Senate. Mr Trump often touts his deal-making skills and this tactic appeared designed to see if some kind of bargain could be reached to fix what he did not like about the deal. The original snapback window passed in December unnoticed. A Senate aide tells the BBC: ""Trump asked them not to do anything in the snapback window and instead said get me a better deal."" Senior members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee - Republicans Bob Corker and Tom Cotton, as well as Democrat Ben Cardin - have been involved in coming up with new legislative text. Mr Trump's repeated excoriation of the JCPOA as the ""worst deal ever"" while electioneering sought to depict the Obama administration as weak. When he refused in October to continue to recertify the deal, the president condemned Iran as a ""fanatical regime"". In a combative speech, he accused Iran of sponsoring terrorism and proposed new sanctions. He said Iran had already violated the 2015 deal, which imposed curbs on Iran's nuclear capability in return for easing international embargoes. But UN inspectors have certified nine times that Iran is in compliance with the deal. Mr Trump's balancing act - decertify but keep the US within the accord for now - allows him to talk tough while staving off the messy consequences if it collapsed altogether. Trump's Iran deal speech: Full text The anti-government protests that erupted across Iran in December have added a layer of complexity to an already thorny issue. Opponents of the Iranian regime are also critical of the deal because they say it does not punish the Islamic Republic for human rights abuses and involvement in conflicts such as Yemen and Syria. With thousands arrested and imprisoned, and reports of deaths, suicide and torture, all eyes are on what Donald Trump's next move will be. Iranian exiles have seized on the unrest to try to lobby American lawmakers to support a tough line on the regime. Reza Pahlavi, the son of Iran's last monarch, was on Capitol Hill on Thursday meeting with hawkish Republican lawmakers, such as Adam Kinzinger and Ted Cruz. Mr Pahlavi urged the sanctioning of Iranian officials and organisations for purported human rights abuses, as well as support for keeping Iran's telecommunications channels open. The waiver suspends sanctions on Iran for 120 days. Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said his department is weighing further sanctions in light of the protests. The US still maintains separate sanctions on Iran related to matters such as terrorism, human rights and ballistic missile development. A National Security Council spokesperson told the BBC: ""The US government will hold accountable individuals and entities involved in the violent suppression of peaceful protests. ""We are examining what mechanisms we could utilize including targeted sanctions and other means.""

Where did it go wrong for Carillion?,"Construction giant Carillion is going into liquidation after its huge financial troubles finally overwhelmed it. The UK's second-largest construction company buckled under the weight of a whopping Â£1.5bn debt pile. Despite discussions between Carillion, its lenders and the government, no deal could be reached to save the company. The big concern is over the disruption this might cause, given Carillion holds so many government contracts - from building hospitals to managing schools. It also employs about 20,000 people in the UK and has more staff abroad. So how did the company get into such dire straits? Carillion specialises in construction, as well as facilities management and ongoing maintenance. It has worked on big private sector projects such as the Battersea Power station redevelopment and the Anfield Stadium expansion. But it is perhaps best known for being one of the largest suppliers of services to the public sector. Carillion worked on the Battersea Power Station revamp Notably, it is part of a consortium that holds a contract to build part of the forthcoming HS2 high speed railway line, and it is the second largest supplier of maintenance services to Network Rail. It also maintains 50,000 homes for the Ministry of Defence, manages nearly 900 schools and manages highways and prisons. Very. Carillion employs 43,000 staff globally, around half of them in the UK where it does most of its business. It also operates in Canada, the Middle East and the Caribbean. In 2016, it had sales of Â£5.2bn and until July boasted a market capitalisation of almost Â£1bn. But since then its share price has plummeted, leaving it worth just Â£61m. Some argue that it overreached itself, taking on too many risky contracts that proved unprofitable. It also faced payment delays in the Middle East that hit its accounts. Last year, it issued three profit warnings in five months and wrote down more than Â£1bn from the value of contracts. This made it much harder to manage its mountainous Â£900m debt pile and Â£600m pension deficit. In December, the firm convinced lenders to give it more time to repay them. However, the company's banks, which include Santander UK, HSBC and Barclays, were reluctant to lend it any more cash. Among its biggest problems were cost overruns on three public sector construction contracts: The Â£350m Midland Metropolitan Hospital in Sandwell. The opening was originally scheduled for October 2018, but difficulties with the heating, lighting and ventilation systems forced a delay of the launch date to spring 2019 The Â£335m Royal Liverpool Hospital. The new 646-bed hospital was due to be finished by March 2017, but the completion date has been repeatedly pushed back amid reports of cracks in the building The Â£745m Aberdeen bypass, which is being built by the Aberdeen Roads Ltd consortium, a joint venture that includes Balfour Beatty and Morrison Construction alongside Carillion. It is due to open in spring 2018. One key stretch was due to open a year earlier, but was delayed because of slow progress in completing initial earthworks. Last month, environment watchdogs slapped a Â£280,000 penalty on the consortium for polluting two of Scotland's most important salmon rivers As Carillion is such a big supplier to the public sector, some fear there will be a lot of disruption. Labour MP Jon Trickett told Parliament before the announcement that if it went under, it would risk ""massive damage"" to a range of public services. Thousands of jobs also hang in the balance. Unions have said workers do not deserve to be caught in the crossfire and have urged the government to safeguard their jobs and bring Carillion's contracts back in house. The government, which has praised Carillion's work on projects such as Crossrail, has said it will provide funding to maintain the public services run by the firm. Analysts say Carillion had a large order book of business lined up. The big question is, who will ultimately pick up its loss-making public contracts - another outsourced services provider or the government itself?

Iran vents anger at Trump sanctions moveTehran says moves against its judiciary chief cross a line and it rejects changes to a nuclear deal.3h3 hours agoMiddle East,"The US strongly criticised Iran for a crackdown on recent anti-government protests Iran says the US has ""crossed a red line"" by imposing sanctions on the head of its judiciary, Ayatollah Sadeq Amoli-Larijani. The foreign ministry vowed to retaliate but did not say what form any action might take. Iran also rejected any changes to its nuclear deal with world powers. US President Donald Trump, a critic of the 2015 accord to prevent Iran developing nuclear arms, said he would extend sanctions relief one last time. However, the US imposed fresh sanctions on 14 individuals and entities over alleged human rights abuses. President Trump said he was giving Europe and the US ""a last chance"" to fix ""terrible flaws"" in the nuclear agreement signed by Iran and six world powers in 2015. The White House wants EU signatories to agree permanent restrictions on Iran's uranium enrichment. Under the current deal they are set to expire in 2025. Mr Trump also wants Iran's ballistic missile programme to be addressed. Is Trump going to kill Iran deal? Iran nuclear deal: Key details Although the US has suspended sanctions against Iran following the nuclear deal, it still imposes punitive measures over issues such as terrorism, human rights and ballistic missile development. The US Treasury issued a statement on Friday saying Ayatollah Amoli-Larijani was responsible for the ""torture or cruel, inhumane, and degrading treatment or punishment of prisoners,externalin Iran, including amputations"". It froze any assets he and the other individuals and entities on the list hold in the US, and ""generally prohibited"" Americans from engaging in transactions with them. Foreign financial institutions or individuals could also face sanctions for doing business with those blacklisted, the US Treasury added. The head of the Iranian judiciary had called for a crackdown on ""rioters"" and ""vandals"" following a recent spate of anti-government protests in Iranian cities. Iran has complained that US sanctions not connected to nuclear activity have effectively cancelled out any financial benefits it expected from the 2015 deal. Voices from Iran: 'We have the right to protest' Iran's foreign ministry accused Mr Trump of ""continuing to take hostile measures against the Iranian people and repeating the threats that have failed many times"". This video can not be played A timeline of what Trump has said about the Iran deal Iran, it said, would not accept any amendments to the nuclear deal ""now or in the future"" or allow any other issues to be linked to it. Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif accused the US of making a ""desperate attempt"" to undermine a ""solid"" deal. The accord signed between six global powers and Iran saw Iran agree to reduce uranium enrichment activity drastically, dispose of its enriched uranium stocks and modify a heavy water facility so it could not produce material suitable for a nuclear bomb. In return, decades of international and US nuclear-related sanctions were suspended. As part of an agreement with Congress, the president has to sign a waiver suspending the sanctions every 120 days. Mr Trump has repeatedly criticised the deal - reached under his predecessor Barack Obama - as ""the worst ever"". The waiver he will sign suspends sanctions for another 120 days but he warned that if a new agreement was not made, sanctions would not be waived again. ""If at any time I judge that such an agreement is not within reach, I will withdraw from the deal immediately,"" he said. US officials say the president will work with European partners to try to broker an agreement limiting Iran's ballistic missile activities. He was prepared to back a modification to the existing deal if it were made permanent, one official said. The president also wants the US Congress to amend a law on US participation in the nuclear deal, so that Washington can reimpose all sanctions if Iran breaches certain ""trigger points"". This would involve negotiations between the US and its European allies rather than talks with Iran, the official said. Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister, Sergei Ryabkov, described Mr Trump's comments as ""extremely negative"". Germany has said it will continue to call for the deal's full implementation and will consult on a ""common way forward"" with the UK and France. French President Emmanuel Macron phoned Mr Trump on Thursday to call for ""the strict application of the deal and the importance of all the signatories to respect it"".

"'Mississippi Burning' KKK leader diesEdgar Ray Killen, 92, was only jailed in 2005, 41 years after he helped organise a triple murder.12h12 hours agoUS & Canada","Killen was sent to prison in 2005 for his role in the triple murder Edgar Ray Killen, the 1960s Ku Klux Klan leader who was convicted over the infamous deaths of three civil rights workers in Mississippi, has died. The 92-year-old was serving a 60-year sentence, after being jailed in 2005, four decades after the 1964 murders. The men's disappearance and deaths shocked the country and helped catalyse the passage of the Civil Rights Act. The triple killing was also the basis for the 1988 Oscar-winning film Mississippi Burning. The movie is a fictionalised take on the events named after the FBI investigation into the case. James Chaney, Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner, all in their 20s, were members of the Congress of Racial Equality (Core) and had been working on the 1964 Freedom Summer campaign to register black voters in the southern state. The men were detained by police before being ambushed and shot by Klansmen who were tipped off about their release. Are US right-wing groups on the rise? The Neo-Nazi who fell in love with a black woman Two of the men had travelled to Mississippi from New York for the project The trio went missing after being arrested by local police on a traffic charge while in Neshoba County, Mississippi. They had been visiting the scene of a fire-bombing and beating at a local church that was going to be used as a Freedom School to educate and help register local African-Americans. Killen pictured in June 1964 After being released from prison in the night, the men were again stopped and then ambushed by KKK members. After the case garnered national attention, the FBI was dispatched to the state to investigate by then Attorney General Robert Kennedy. The three men's bodies were eventually uncovered six weeks after their disappearance, after an informant tipped off the FBI that they had been buried on local farmland. The FBI arrested more than a dozen suspects, including the county's Deputy Sheriff, because of their alleged involvement in the killings. The men's vehicle was found burnt out in a swampy area following their disappearance Their bodies were later recovered in an earthen dam, following a tip-off A Mississippi judge attempted to dismiss the charges against most of the defendants, but the Supreme Court later reversed the decision. After federal intervention, 18 men went on trial in 1967 on civil rights violation charges. Only seven were convicted by an all-white jury, and none served more than seven years in prison. Killen, a former Baptist preacher, was accused of orchestrating the killings, but his trial ended in a hung jury after a juror said she could not convict a preacher. The state did not pursue the case for four decades, but eventually Killen was brought to face a new trial in 2005. Families of the victims, including the mother of James Chaney, testified in 2005 Prosecutors said as a ""kleagle"" or KKK organiser, he had assembled the murderous mob and instructed them how to dispose of the bodies, but was not at the murder scene itself. He was convicted of three charges of manslaughter for recruitment and orchestration. Even after his imprisonment, Killen was said to maintain segregationist views about racial inequality. The Mississippi Department of Corrections said he had known health conditions, and no foul play was suspected in the 92-year-old's death.

France demands UN protection for baguetteThe French president wants the country's famous loaf on a list of worldwide cultural treasures.14m14 minutes agoEurope,"Baguettes being judged during a Paris competition last April The French baguette should be listed as a Unesco cultural treasure, says France's President Emmanuel Macron. ""The baguette is the envy of the whole world,"" he said, in support of a national bakers' association that is promoting the application. The bakers have been inspired by the success of Italy's Naples pizza, which was protected by the UN's cultural body last year. Unesco's list aims to save traditions from globalisation. The Committee for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage meets annually to evaluate nominations from around the world. The bakers say it is not just the name and shape, but the recipe and ingredients that need to be enshrined. ""Excellence and expertise must be preserved, and that is why it should be heritage-listed,"" President Macron told French radio after receiving a group of master bakers at the ElysÃ©e presidential palace in Paris on Friday. Artisan breadmakers have voiced concern about mass-produced imitations. ""When I see the quality of bread in supermarkets, it is impossible not to get angry,"" Dominique Anract, president of the National Confederation of French Patisseries and Bakeries (CNPBF),told food website Atabula,external. ""The bread is frozen, some of it comes from Romania or who knows where, nothing is carried out in accordance of the rules of the art."" The traditional baguette is already protected in France by a 1993 law. To meet the criteria, the bread must only be made from four ingredients: wheat flour, water, yeast and salt. It cannot be frozen or contain added preservatives. Unesco's Lists of Intangible Cultural Heritage is different from its register of places, known as World Heritage Sites. Instead, this list focuses on traditions - mostly crafts, music, dance and cuisine. Yoga, Spanish flamenco and Tibetan Opera have already made the grade, as have Belgian beer culture and the gingerbread craft of northern Croatia. Naples is famed for ""pizzaiuolo"" - twirling pizza dough and baking it in a wood-fired brick oven France has already racked up multiple successful applications, from AlenÃ§on lace-making to French-style equitation. There is even a broadly termed listing for the ""French gastronomic meal"". That submission was centred mostly around the rituals that accompany the cuisine: how wines are paired with dishes, how the table is dressed, and the precise placing of glasses and cutlery. Pizza-twirling gets world heritage status The UK does not have any entries on the list. It is one of few countries in the world that has not signed up to the ""safeguarding intangible heritage"" convention, which was established in 2003.

"Care children list sent to taxi firmsLeicester City Council sent the spreadsheet containing ""hundreds, potentially thousands"" of names.13h13 hours agoLeicester","Leicester City Council told taxi firms not to open or read the information Details of ""hundreds, potentially thousands"" of vulnerable people, including children, have been emailed to taxi firms by a council. Leicester City Council accidentally sent the spreadsheet to 27 companies while getting tenders to transport people in care or with special needs. Councillor Ross Grant said the news made him feel ""sick in my stomach"". The authority said it took data protection ""very seriously"" and had launched an investigation. The original email was sent on Tuesday morning, and a recall email was sent just over 24 hours later. The recall said: ""[The original] email had a large file attached to it called 'Taxi Tender Live v 3' that contains passenger information and was sent in error to your company. ""Please delete this email. Please then delete the email from your ""Deleted items"" folder. Please do not try to open or read it."" It then stated disclosing any information from the email was a breach of the Data Protection Act. The council said ""much more limited"" information was usually shared with outside firms Mr Grant said he felt ""sick in my stomach"" that ""hundreds, potentially thousands"" of people could be involved. ""We are talking children the court has taken action to protect from someone who would put them at risk and the council is potentially the organisation leaking their address,"" he added. ""There is no guarantee this has not been copied and spread, we cannot put the genie back in the bottle. ""I am not happy at all, I have had no answers to my questions from the council and if I don't get some I will be taking it to a higher level."" A spokesperson for Labour-controlled Leicester City Council said: ""Information would normally be shared with taxi companies on a much more limited basis.

More children having teeth out in hospitalIn one case a 14-year-old's adult teeth were removed due to fizzy drinks and they needed false teeth.19m20 minutes agoHealth,"Dentists have accused the government of having a ""short-sighted"" approach to tooth decay in England after hospital operations to remove children's teeth increased to nearly 43,000. There were 42,911 operations in 2016-17 - up from 40,800 the previous year and 36,833 in 2012-13, NHS figures show. The British Dental Association said England had a ""second-class"" dental service compared to Wales and Scotland. The government said it was ""determined"" to reduce the number of extractions. Doctors said many of the tooth extractions would be caused by the food and drink children consume and were therefore ""completely preventable"". Dental surgeon Claire Stevens, who works in a hospital in north-west England, said most of her patients were aged five to nine, but it was not uncommon to remove all 20 baby teeth from a two-year-old because of decay. She said she has also extracted a 14-year-old's permanent teeth due to fizzy drinks. They then needed false teeth. An analysis of NHS figures by the Local Government Association, which represents councils in England and Wales, found the equivalent of 170 hospital tooth extractions a day were being carried out on under-18s. These are done in hospital under general anaesthetic, rather than at a dental practice. The operations would have cost the NHS about Â£36m last year and Â£165m since 2012, the LGA found. Kellogg's to cut sugar in kids' cereals Sugar targets set for cakes and chocolate What is the UK's most sugary drink? Mick Armstrong, chairman of the BDA, said: ""These statistics are a badge of dishonour for health ministers, who have failed to confront a wholly preventable disease. ""Tooth decay is the number one reason for child hospital admissions, but communities across England have been left hamstrung without resources or leadership."" This video can not be played Dental surgeon Claire Stevens says it's not uncommon to remove all 20 baby teeth in a two-year-old The BDA said England was receiving a ""second-class service"" because, unlike Wales and Scotland, it has no dedicated national child oral health programme. It said the government's centrepiece policy Starting Well - aimed at improving oral health outcomes for ""high-risk"" children - had received no new funding and was operating in parts of just 13 local authorities in England. ""The BDA has insisted that national authorities must provide resources to enable all children in England to benefit,"" it said. The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health said the figures were ""startling"" and ""should act as a wake-up call to policy makers and act as the catalyst for change"". The LGA said the data demonstrated the ""urgent need to introduce measures to curb our sugar addiction which is causing children's teeth to rot"". The Royal College of Surgeons said the statistics were ""alarming"" and called for supervised tooth brushing sessions in all nursery schools across England. This video can not be played People use circular motion, horizontal, rolling or vibratory techniques to clean their teeth, but which is the right way? A Department of Health and Social Care spokeswoman said it was ""determined to reduce the number of children having teeth extracted because of tooth decay"" and pointed to its sugar tax, which comes into effect in April on soft drinks with the most added sugar. ""Our world-class NHS dentists are also playing a vital role to improve dental hygiene - in the last year 6.8 million children were seen by a dentist, representing 58.5% of the child population,"" she said. The spokesman added that the Starting Well programme was introduced last year to improve the oral health of children most at risk in 13 high priority areas and NHS England was planning to expand the programme to other areas. Dr Sandra White, director of dental public health at Public Health England, said parents could reduce tooth decay through cutting back on their children's sugary food and drink and encouraging them to brush their teeth with fluoride toothpaste twice a day, as well as regular trips to the dentist. Government initiatives in Scotland and Wales are said to be behind their falling rates of tooth decay in young children. In Scotland, the Childsmile programmeis claimed to have cut Â£5m off treatment costs andthe Designed to Smile programme in Waleshas helped reduce decay among five-year-olds in deprived areas. A debate on children's dental examinations and treatment is due to take place in the House of Lords on 18 January. Follow Alex onTwitter,external.

The world's worst TV and movie extras,"A very serious moment on a recent episode of Coronation Street was gloriously upstaged by a hugely underwhelmed extra. The supposed background character stole the limelight from actress Sair Khan, whose character Alya was facing the press about her dead boyfriend. But all eyes were on the barely-bothered paparazzi. Her performance was so magnificent, 40,000 people have shared a tweet calling for her to win an Oscar. Here is the show-stopping moment.,external The role of an extra is to bring scenes in TV and movies to life, filling a background with the suggestion of a living, breathing world full of movement and life. But sometimes, there's a bit too much (or not enough) 'movement and life' going on in the background. The Coronation Street snapper joins the archives as one of the world's most memorable extras ever. She's in good company. Here are some of TV and film's most iconic extras. You're welcome. Dunkirk was not a happy film based on a one of the darkest moments for allied forces during World War II. Sadly, no one told this happy bunny.

But they also need to perform the basic function their role requires. This James Bond extra did a marvellous job of sweeping the air. Will he return for more Bond movies?,external The Dark Knight Rises is considered by many as one of cinema's best superhero movies.

"'Window closing' for mudslide survivorsA two-year-old child is among several still missing in California, as the death toll reaches 18.6h6 hours agoUS & Canada","Fire Department officials said they remained optimistic, despite difficult conditions At least 18 people have been confirmed dead in mudslides in California, as officials admit the window is closing for other survivors to be found alive. Authorities believe five people are still missing, aged between two and 30. Four children are among the dead, including a three-year-old girl who died alongside her mother. Mandatory evacuations have been extended as more than 1,200 emergency workers continue to search mud as deep as 15ft (4.6m) in places. Drones, military vehicles and search dogs have been brought in to help with rescue and clean-up efforts. ""We've got a window that's closing, but we're still very optimistic. There's been plenty of cases where they've found people a week after,"" Santa Barbara County Fire Department spokesman Mike Eliason said. Weather conditions caused large rocks and mud to sweep down into residential areas Uncertainty remains around the exact number of people still missing, as authorities warned the figure may continue to fluctuate. On Thursday they believed dozens were unaccounted for, but the number was revised down. A mandatory evacuation order has been extended, as Santa Barbara's County Sherriff said residents staying behind were hindering recovery efforts. Gas and electricity supplies are expected to be cut off in the area on Saturday. This video can not be played Video captures moment the mudslide hit Burbank The flash flooding happened on Tuesday after the first rain in months hit ground that had been scorched in December's widespread wildfires. After a wildfire, burned vegetation and charred soil create a water repellent layer which blocks water absorption. Together with the loss of vegetation, this leads to an increased risk of mudslides and floods. All of those killed died of ""multiple traumatic injuries due to flash flood with mudslides,"" according to the Santa Barbara County Coroner's Office.

African countries ask for Trump apology,"This video can not be played 'Mr President, are you a racist?' The organisation representing African countries has demanded that US President Donald Trump apologise after he reportedly called nations on the continent ""shitholes"". The African Union mission in Washington DC expressed its ""shock, dismay and outrage"" and said the Trump administration misunderstood Africans. The US leader made the alleged remark in a Thursday meeting on immigration. But Mr Trump has denied using the language reported. He has been backed by two Republicans who were at the White House meeting, but Democratic Senator Dick Durbin said Mr Trump called African countries ""shitholes"" several times and used ""racist"" language. On Friday, Mr Trump on Friday tweeted that his language he used at the private meeting with lawmakers to discuss immigration legislation had been ""tough"". But he added that the words attributed to him were ""not the language used"". This video can not be played Dick Durbin: ""Trump said these hate-filled things, and he said them repeatedly"" It said the ""remarks dishonour the celebrated American creed and respect for diversity and human dignity"". It added: ""While expressing our shock, dismay and outrage, the African Union strongly believes that there is a huge misunderstanding of the African continent and its people by the current Administration. ""There is a serious need for dialogue between the US Administration and the African countries."" How countries have reacted Was Trump's alleged slur actually racist? US ambassador says he cannot serve Trump The pan-African grouping represents 55 member states throughout the continent. It succeeded the Organisation of African Unity -  which originated in the decolonisation struggles of the early 1960s - in 2002. The remarks were allegedly made when lawmakers visited him on Thursday to discuss a bipartisan proposal that would impose new restrictions on immigration but protect the so-called ""Dreamers"" - hundreds of thousands of immigrants brought to the US illegally as children - from deportation. Mr Trump was said to have told them that instead of granting temporary residency to citizens of countries hit by natural disasters, war or epidemics, the US should instead be taking in migrants from countries like Norway. ""Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?"" the Washington Post quoted him as saying. What has Trump said about your country? Democrats decry 'cruel' immigration order Migrant success stories in the US Mr Durbin said that when Mr Trump was told that the largest groups of immigrants with Temporary Protected Status (TPS) were from El Salvador, Honduras and Haiti, the president responded: ""Haitians? Do we need more Haitians?"" But in another tweet on Friday the president denied that he insulted Haitians. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Many US media outlets reported the comments on Thursday, quoting witnesses or people briefed on the meeting. The White House did not deny them. ""I cannot believe that in the history of the White House, in that Oval Office, any president has ever spoken the words that I personally heard our president speak yesterday,""Mr Durbintold reporters on Friday House SpeakerPaul Ryan, a top Republican, said the reported comments were ""unfortunate"" and ""unhelpful"" Hillary Clinton, who lost to Mr Trump in the 2016 presidential election, said the country had been subjected to his ""ignorant, racist views of anyone who doesn't look like him"" and noted that it was eight years since Haiti was hit by a devastating earthquake Republican SenatorsTom CottonandDavid Perdue, of Arkansas and Georgia, said that they could not remember Mr Trump describing countries as ""shitholes"" in the meeting Mia Love, a Utah Republican and the only Haitian-American in Congress, demanded an apology from Mr Trump for the ""unkind, divisive, elitist"" comments Steve King,a right-wing Republican Congressman from Iowa, backed the president in a tweet: Allow Twitter content?

Another Republican Senator who was there, Lindsey Graham, did not deny the comments were made. ""Following comments by the president, I said my piece directly to him yesterday. The president and all those attending the meeting know what I said and how I feel,"" he said. On Friday, Mr Trump ignored press questions about the issue as he signed a proclamation declaring a holiday in honour of civil rights hero Martin Luther King Jr - as presidents do every year. He said Americans were celebrating that ""self-evident truth"" that ""no matter what the colour of our skin or the place of our birth, we are all created equal by God"". Botswanasummoned the US ambassador and asked the envoy ""to clarify if Botswana is regarded as a 'shithole' country given that there are Botswana nationals residing in the US"" UN human rights spokesmanRupert Colville said the comments, if confirmed, were ""shocking and shameful"", adding: ""I'm sorry but there is no other word for this but racist.""

Care children list sent to taxi firms,"Leicester City Council told taxi firms not to open or read the information Details of ""hundreds, potentially thousands"" of vulnerable people, including children, have been emailed to taxi firms by a council. Leicester City Council accidentally sent the spreadsheet to 27 companies while getting tenders to transport people in care or with special needs. Councillor Ross Grant said the news made him feel ""sick in my stomach"". The authority said it took data protection ""very seriously"" and had launched an investigation. The original email was sent on Tuesday morning, and a recall email was sent just over 24 hours later. The recall said: ""[The original] email had a large file attached to it called 'Taxi Tender Live v 3' that contains passenger information and was sent in error to your company. ""Please delete this email. Please then delete the email from your ""Deleted items"" folder. Please do not try to open or read it."" It then stated disclosing any information from the email was a breach of the Data Protection Act. The council said ""much more limited"" information was usually shared with outside firms Mr Grant said he felt ""sick in my stomach"" that ""hundreds, potentially thousands"" of people could be involved. ""We are talking children the court has taken action to protect from someone who would put them at risk and the council is potentially the organisation leaking their address,"" he added. ""There is no guarantee this has not been copied and spread, we cannot put the genie back in the bottle. ""I am not happy at all, I have had no answers to my questions from the council and if I don't get some I will be taking it to a higher level."" A spokesperson for Labour-controlled Leicester City Council said: ""Information would normally be shared with taxi companies on a much more limited basis. ""We take data protection and confidentiality very seriously and took immediate action, contacting all of the firms and asking them to delete the information.

'Window closing' for mudslide survivors,"Fire Department officials said they remained optimistic, despite difficult conditions At least 18 people have been confirmed dead in mudslides in California, as officials admit the window is closing for other survivors to be found alive. Authorities believe five people are still missing, aged between two and 30. Four children are among the dead, including a three-year-old girl who died alongside her mother. Mandatory evacuations have been extended as more than 1,200 emergency workers continue to search mud as deep as 15ft (4.6m) in places. Drones, military vehicles and search dogs have been brought in to help with rescue and clean-up efforts. ""We've got a window that's closing, but we're still very optimistic. There's been plenty of cases where they've found people a week after,"" Santa Barbara County Fire Department spokesman Mike Eliason said. Weather conditions caused large rocks and mud to sweep down into residential areas Uncertainty remains around the exact number of people still missing, as authorities warned the figure may continue to fluctuate. On Thursday they believed dozens were unaccounted for, but the number was revised down. A mandatory evacuation order has been extended, as Santa Barbara's County Sherriff said residents staying behind were hindering recovery efforts. Gas and electricity supplies are expected to be cut off in the area on Saturday. This video can not be played Video captures moment the mudslide hit Burbank The flash flooding happened on Tuesday after the first rain in months hit ground that had been scorched in December's widespread wildfires. After a wildfire, burned vegetation and charred soil create a water repellent layer which blocks water absorption. Together with the loss of vegetation, this leads to an increased risk of mudslides and floods. All of those killed died of ""multiple traumatic injuries due to flash flood with mudslides,"" according to the Santa Barbara County Coroner's Office. California mudslides: Before and after In pictures: Mudslides cause chaos The youngest victim, Kailley Benitez, three, died alongside her mother and 10-year-old cousin.

'Mississippi Burning' KKK leader dies,"Killen was sent to prison in 2005 for his role in the triple murder Edgar Ray Killen, the 1960s Ku Klux Klan leader who was convicted over the infamous deaths of three civil rights workers in Mississippi, has died. The 92-year-old was serving a 60-year sentence, after being jailed in 2005, four decades after the 1964 murders. The men's disappearance and deaths shocked the country and helped catalyse the passage of the Civil Rights Act. The triple killing was also the basis for the 1988 Oscar-winning film Mississippi Burning. The movie is a fictionalised take on the events named after the FBI investigation into the case. James Chaney, Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner, all in their 20s, were members of the Congress of Racial Equality (Core) and had been working on the 1964 Freedom Summer campaign to register black voters in the southern state. The men were detained by police before being ambushed and shot by Klansmen who were tipped off about their release. Are US right-wing groups on the rise? The Neo-Nazi who fell in love with a black woman Two of the men had travelled to Mississippi from New York for the project The trio went missing after being arrested by local police on a traffic charge while in Neshoba County, Mississippi. They had been visiting the scene of a fire-bombing and beating at a local church that was going to be used as a Freedom School to educate and help register local African-Americans. Killen pictured in June 1964 After being released from prison in the night, the men were again stopped and then ambushed by KKK members. After the case garnered national attention, the FBI was dispatched to the state to investigate by then Attorney General Robert Kennedy. The three men's bodies were eventually uncovered six weeks after their disappearance, after an informant tipped off the FBI that they had been buried on local farmland. The FBI arrested more than a dozen suspects, including the county's Deputy Sheriff, because of their alleged involvement in the killings. The men's vehicle was found burnt out in a swampy area following their disappearance Their bodies were later recovered in an earthen dam, following a tip-off A Mississippi judge attempted to dismiss the charges against most of the defendants, but the Supreme Court later reversed the decision. After federal intervention, 18 men went on trial in 1967 on civil rights violation charges. Only seven were convicted by an all-white jury, and none served more than seven years in prison. Killen, a former Baptist preacher, was accused of orchestrating the killings, but his trial ended in a hung jury after a juror said she could not convict a preacher. The state did not pursue the case for four decades, but eventually Killen was brought to face a new trial in 2005. Families of the victims, including the mother of James Chaney, testified in 2005 Prosecutors said as a ""kleagle"" or KKK organiser, he had assembled the murderous mob and instructed them how to dispose of the bodies, but was not at the murder scene itself. He was convicted of three charges of manslaughter for recruitment and orchestration. Even after his imprisonment, Killen was said to maintain segregationist views about racial inequality. The Mississippi Department of Corrections said he had known health conditions, and no foul play was suspected in the 92-year-old's death.

Clive Lewis returns to Labour front bench,"Labour MP Clive Lewis has been reappointed to the party's front bench as a shadow Treasury minister. Mr Lewis resigned as shadow business secretary in February over wanting to vote against the European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill. He was one of 52 MPs to defy Labour Party orders to back the bill in a Parliament vote. MPs Preet Gill, Jack Dromey and Karen Lee have also been appointed to the shadow team. At the time of the vote Mr Lewis had said he ""cannot, in all good conscience, vote for something I believe will ultimately harm the city I have the honour to represent, love and call home"". Last month,Mr Lewis was cleared of sexual harassment allegationsby a party inquiry. The Norwich South MP had been accused of groping a party supporter at the Labour conference in Brighton last September. How did your MP vote on Brexit bill? Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the front bench was ""now a government in waiting"".

Reality Check: Who sold the US embassy in London?,"The claim: The Obama administration sold the US embassy in London for ""peanuts"". The verdict: President Trump is right that the sale did take place during the Obama administration. The final amount was not disclosed but estimates of its value varied between Â£300m and Â£500m. However, the decision to move was taken when George W Bush was in the White House. President Trump took to Twitter to announce he had cancelled a trip to the UK where he was expected to open the new US embassy building in London. He said it was because his predecessor Barack Obama sold the old building for ""peanuts"". The US mission is moving to its new diplomatic headquarters in south London after decades in the site at Grosvenor Square. The US government sold the lease for the old embassy to Qatari real estate group Qatari Diar, which plans to turn the building into a hotel. So, was President Trump right about which president sanctioned the sale? The old US embassy in Grosvenor Square, London The building itself was never owned outright by the United States. It owned a 999-year leasehold, but the freehold is owned by Grosvenor Estates. The decision to move away from the Grade II listed building to Nine Elms was taken by the George W Bush administration in October 2008, shortly before he left office. The state department said it would begin construction on a new site in Nine Elms and the existing embassy was put up for sale immediately. It said it considered renovating the existing building but said the goal of moving to a secure, modern and environmentally sustainable site could best be met by moving. Reports that the sale of the old building had been completed appeared inNovember 2009,,externalunder the Obama administration. So President Trump is correct in that sense. It was reported in the Financial Times on 21 January 2009 that another Qatari firm had emerged as favourites to buy the building - a day after President Obama's inauguration - which means any final deal was agreed when he was in power.

It depends what you call peanuts. The final fee was not disclosed, but before negotiations began, the building was thought to be worth between Â£300m and Â£500m. The building was designed by modernist architect Eero Saarinen and completed in 1957. It was givenGrade II listed,externalstatus because of its special facade, which means the building's design cannot be altered. There was a suggestion that had reduced the value, which, according tothe Guardian,,externalmight have reached Â£500m. What do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

Was alleged slur actually racist?,"This video can not be played 'Mr President, are you a racist?' US President Donald Trump's reported reference to Haiti and African nations as ""shitholes"" has sparked global outrage. But was it racist? Charlton McIlwain, professor and dean at NYU, and Drew Liquerman of Republicans Overseas, offer contradicting opinions on the matter. Mr McIlwain:Yesterday, Donald Trump said African and Haitian immigrants hail from ""shithole countries"".A little black girl and child of Haitian immigrants I know overheard. Unprompted, and defiant she responded to her mother: ""Donald Trump is a shithole!"" The word itself was foreign to her, but she intuitively understood the words were derogatory, demeaning - racist. In Trump's words she recognised a constellation of associations and inferences that Trump drew on to make this so. A statement is racist when it explicitly denigrates and/or asserts as true a negative, longstanding stereotype about an entire group of people, signalled by the colour of their skin. ""Shithole"" fits the bill in the vilest way. Those who manage with a straight face to say Trump's words were not racist no doubt will point out that he did not specify that black people from these countries are shitholes. But, he did not have to. We have longstanding and differential associations between the colours white and black. For much of our recent history, white has always represented all that is pure, clean, desirable. These associations are found in the language of our dictionaries, the one-time definition of Africa as the ""dark continent"",and the way we demarcated slaves from non-slaves throughout the slave trade. These associations define our beauty standards, animated through film and television's past and present. And, these colour associations still dominate our perceptions of leadership, images of success and attributions of worth and value. Because of these longstanding and pervasive associations between black and white, Trump need only connecta few dots to express his racism. Denigrate immigrants from countries like Africa and Haiti as shitholes with no value, then specify their opposite - people from ""Norway"".Even a little girl can see what the primary difference is between the two. This video can not be played Dick Durbin: ""Trump said these hate-filled things, and he said them repeatedly"" Mr Liquerman:While elite Washington media and political class is outraged over President Trump's reported remarks on immigration, it's unclear what he actually said (the White House has disputed Senator Durbin's account). President Trump's alleged harsh characterisation of Haiti is certainly uncouth, but nothing suggests it's racist. Haiti is indisputably the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere and has serious disease and development problems, according to the WHO and UN. Those same organisations (and American leftists) consistently cite Norway as a prosperous, successful country. With that established, it's perfectly rational for any country - including the US - to prefer educated and high-skilled immigrants, and, unsurprisingly, those immigrants disproportionately come from wealthy, developed countries. If President Trump had suggested we turn away all Haitians - even the educated, high-skilled ones who would help our country and economy, as many immigrants from Haiti do - it would be a different story. But he has made clear that he wants help the economy by bringing in the best immigrants, wherever they may come from. Country of origin should neither make nor break anyone's immigration application, as there are high-skilled and talented citizens in every country who could contribute a lot to the US. But it's foolish to believe they are as prevalent in Haiti, where the literacy rate is around 60%, as they are in Norway, where the literacy rate is nearly 100%. Ultimately, this episode is a case study in Democrats' bad faith. Thankfully, informed Americans are too smart to fall into this trap, the coming reforms to US immigration policy will reflect the views of the Trump administration, the GOP, and the American people, not Washington insiders.

How countries reacted,"Mr Trump said he would prefer to take in migrants from nations like Norway, whose prime minister he met on Wednesday US President Donald Trump has drawn widespread criticism after reportedly describing African nations as ""shithole countries"" and suggesting immigrants from Haiti should be removed from the country. According to Democratic Senator Richard Durbin, who was present at the meeting, the president asked why the US should take immigrants from such countries, instead of from countries like Norway. Mr Trump's team did not initially deny the remarks. Mr Trump issued an apparent denial on Twitter on Friday, saying the language he used ""was tough, but this was not the language"". Full story: Trump 'in crude Oval Office outburst about migrants' TheUnited Nationshuman rights office called the reported comments ""shocking and shameful"". ""I'm sorry but there is no other word for this but racist"", said a spokesman in Geneva. TheAfrican Union(AU) said it was ""frankly alarmed"" by Mr Trump's statement. ""Given the historical reality of how many Africans arrived in the United States as slaves, this statement flies in the face of all accepted behaviour and practice,"" AU spokeswoman Ebba Kalondo told the Associated Press news agency. InBotswana, the US ambassador was summoned in a letter and asked ""to clarify if Botswana is regarded as a 'shithole' country"". The US ambassador toPanamaresigned, according to Reuters news agency, telling the State Department in a letter that he could no longer serve in the Trump administration. InHaiti, Rene Civil, a left-wing activist, demanded the US president apologise ""before the entire African continent, as well as before Haiti, the country whose blood has been used by ancestors who have served with their minds and bodies to liberate the United States itself from slavery"". InNigeria,one resident in Lagos told Reuters news agency: ""Calling [every] African country shithole is really, really, very bad and I think every African country should just learn from this and probably just stay in their country and work with their resources."" InSouth Africa, ANC deputy secretary general Jessie Duarte said: ""Ours is not a shithole country and neither is Haiti or any other country in distress. And it is extremely offensive for President Trump to make statements about other countries that are really not complimentary of the US's position or policy positions on those countries."" 11 things we never said before Trump What promises has Trump kept as president? In theUK, Prime Minister Theresa May's office said Ms May did not share Mr Trump's reported characterisation of the nations. A spokesman declined to comment on ""alleged private remarks"", but asked if Ms May viewed the countries Mr Trump was referring to as ""shitholes"", the spokesman replied: ""No."" An immigration policy analyst in Washington DC made the point that immigrants fromNorwayactually did badly out of immigration to the US at the turn of the last century. Alex Nowrasteh, an immigration policy analyst at the Cato Institute, said ""this shows that the 'loser immigrants' from yesterday's 'shitholes' tend to turn into excellent, rich Americans after a few generations while their countries improve substantially"".

Democratmembers of Congress said the remark clearly showed Mr Trump was racist. ""We always knew that President Trump doesn't like people from certain countries or people [of] certain colours,"" said Congressman Luis Gutierrez. ""We can now we say with 100% confidence that the president is a racist who does not share the values enshrined in our constitution."" Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky said: ""Just when you thought Donald Trump could not get any more racist, he digs down to an even deeper low."" SomeRepublicansspoke out about over the remarks. Republican Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, who was born in Cuba and whose south Florida district includes many Haitian immigrants, said: ""Shame on him. It is reprehensible, it is disgusting, it is racist."" Mia Love, a congresswoman from Utah who is of Haitian descent, called Mr Trump's reported comments ""unkind"" and ""divisive"", and demanded an apology. African-American Senator Tim Scott, who says America is ""born from immigrants"", is quoted as saying: ""If these comments are the president's words, they are disappointing to say the least.,external"" Iowa Congressman Steve King, an immigration hardliner and staunch supporter of Mr Trump, spoke up for the president, telling him to ""hang in there"" and calling on him to end the Daca immigration programme, calling it by a derogatory name. ""Hang in there Mr. President @realDonaldTrump. If those countries aren't as you described, Democrats should be happy to deport criminal aliens back to them. &End #AnchorBabies, too."" Jesse Walters, a host on right-wing Fox News, said the reported remark ""doesn't move the needle at all"" against the president. Allow Twitter content?

Iran nuclear deal explained,"In 2015, Iran agreed a long-term deal on its nuclear programme with a group of world powers known as the P5+1 - the US, UK, France, China, Russia and Germany. It came after years of tension over Iran's alleged efforts to develop a nuclear weapon. Iran insisted that its nuclear programme was entirely peaceful, but the international community did not believe that. Underthe accord,external, Iran agreed to limit its sensitive nuclear activities and allow in international inspectors in return for the lifting of crippling economic sanctions. Here is what was meant to happen according to the plan, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). Iran's uranium stockpile will be reduced by 98% to 300kg for 15 years Uranium can have nuclear-related uses once it has been refined, or enriched. This is achieved by increasing the content of its most fissile isotopes, U-235, through the use of centrifuges - machines which spin at supersonic speeds. Low-enriched uranium, which typically has a 3-5% concentration of U-235, can be used to produce fuel for commercial nuclear power plants. Highly enriched uranium has a purity of 20% or more and is used in research reactors. Weapons-grade uranium is 90% enriched or more. In July 2015, Iran had two uranium enrichment plants - Natanz and Fordo - and was operating almost 20,000 centrifuges. Under the JCPOA, the country was limited to installing no more than 5,060 of the oldest and least efficient centrifuges at Natanz until 2026 - 10 years after the deal's ""implementation day"" in January 2016. Iran's stockpile of enriched uranium was also reduced by 98% to 300kg (660lbs), a figure that must not be exceeded until 2031. It must also keep the stockpile's level of enrichment at 3.67%. In addition, research and development must take place only at Natanz and be limited until 2024. No enrichment is permitted at Fordo until 2031, and the underground facility must be converted into a nuclear, physics and technology centre. The 1,044 centrifuges left at the site are allowed to produce radioisotopes for use in medicine, agriculture, industry and science. Iran is redesigning the Arak reactor so it cannot produce any weapons-grade plutonium Iran had been building a heavy-water nuclear facility near the town of Arak. Spent fuel from a heavy-water reactor contains plutonium suitable for a nuclear bomb. World powers had originally wanted Arak dismantled because of the potential military use. Under an interim nuclear deal in 2013, Iran agreed not to commission or fuel the reactor. Under the JCPOA, Iran said it would redesign the reactor so it could not produce any weapons-grade plutonium, and that all spent fuel would be sent out of the country as long as the modified reactor existed. Iran must also not build additional heavy-water reactors or accumulate any excess heavy water until 2031. Iran is required to allow IAEA inspectors to access any site they deem suspicious At the time of the agreement, then-US President Barack Obama's administration expressed confidence that the JCPOA would prevent Iran from building a nuclear programme in secret. Iran, it said, had committed to ""extraordinary and robust monitoring, verification, and inspection"". Inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the global nuclear watchdog, were tasked with continuously monitoring Iran's declared nuclear sites and verifying that no fissile material is moved covertly to a secret location to build a bomb. Iran also agreed to implement the Additional Protocol to their IAEA Safeguards Agreement, which allows inspectors to access any site anywhere in the country they deem suspicious. Until 2031, Iran will have 24 days to comply with any IAEA access request. If it refuses, an eight-member Joint Commission - including Iran - will rule on the issue. It can decide on punitive steps, including the reimposition of sanctions. A majority vote by the commission suffices. A UN ban on the import of ballistic missile technology will remain in place for up to eight years Before July 2015, Iran had enough enriched uranium and centrifuges to create eight to 10 bombs, according to the then Obama administration. US experts estimated at the time that if Iran had decided to rush to make a bomb, it would take two to three months until it had enough 90%-enriched uranium to build a nuclear weapon - the so-called ""break-out time"". The Obama administration said the JCPOA would remove the key elements Iran would need to create a bomb and increase its break-out time to one year or more. Iran also agreed not to engage in activities, including research and development, which could contribute to the development of a nuclear bomb. In December 2015, the IAEA's board of governors voted to end its decade-long investigation into the possible military dimensions of Iran's nuclear programme. The agency's then-director-general, Yukiya Amano, said the report concluded that until 2003 Iran had conducted ""a co-ordinated effort"" on ""a range of activities relevant to the development of a nuclear explosive device"". Iran continued with some activities until 2009, but after that there were ""no credible indications"" of weapons development, he added. Iran also agreed to the continuation of a UN ban on its imports and exports of conventional arms until 2020. Restrictions on its import of ballistic missile technology will remain in place until 2023. The nuclear deal allowed Iran to sell crude oil again on the international market Sanctions previously imposed by the UN, US and EU in an attempt to force Iran to halt uranium enrichment crippled its economy, costing the country more than $160bn (Â£119bn) in oil revenue from 2012 to 2016 alone. Under the deal, all nuclear-related sanctions on Iran were lifted and the country was able to resume selling oil on international markets and using the global financial system for trade. It also gained access to more than $100bn in assets frozen overseas. However, in May 2018, then-US President Donald Trump abandoned the JCPOA, calling it ""defective at its core"". He reinstated all US sanctions on Iran that November as part of a ""maximum pressure"" campaign to compel the country to negotiate a replacement that would also curb its ballistic missile programme and its involvement in regional conflicts. But Iran refused and saw its economy plunge into recession and the value of its currency fall to record lows, which in turn caused inflation to soar to the highest level in decades. When the sanctions were tightened in 2019, Iran began breaching the deal's restrictions, arguing that the JCPOA allowed one party to ""cease performing its commitments... in whole or in part"" in the event of ""significant non-performance"" by others. By November 2021, Iran had amassed a stockpile of enriched uranium that was many times larger than permitted, including at least 17.7kg (39lb) of material enriched to 60% purity - just below the level needed for a bomb. It had also resumed enrichment activity at Fordo; installed more centrifuges, and of a more advanced type, than allowed; and taken steps in the production of enriched uranium metal, which is a key material in nuclear weapons. Iran had also significantly curtailed access for international inspectors by ceasing implementation of the Additional Protocol of its IAEA Safeguards Agreement. Talks to save the JCPOA and bring Iran back into compliance began in May 2021, after Joe Biden succeeded Mr Trump as US president. He says the US will rejoin and lift the sanctions if Iran reverses its breaches. His Iranian counterpart, Ebrahim Raisi, says the US must make the first move. If the negotiations were to fail and Iran was confirmed to have violated the deal, all UN sanctions would  automatically ""snap back"" in place for 10 years, with the possibility of a five-year extension.

""While we will be able to run many of our normal timetabled services, there will continue to be some disruption in the next few days,"" he added. Deputy managing director of East Midlands Trains, Kirsty Derry, said because of the fire damage traveller services at the station are limited. ""Obviously it is safe but there are no toilet facilities, no catering facilities and people will not be able to have step-free access. Repairs are expected to take ""months"" ""The main ticket hall, because of the impact on our IT, is not opening. We are happy to accept people who are taking reference booking details with them."" Anyone requiring step-free access is advised to travel from Derby. Nottingham Fire and Rescue tweeted a picture from inside the station Part of Nottingham railway station built at the start of the last century is listed but that section escaped the worst of the damage, for which Ms Derry is thankful. ""I can't praise their efforts enough really. The historic part, the listed part, is in really good condition. It is the newer part that opened in 2014 that has caught the brunt of the damage really,"" she said. She added it is not yet known how long it will take to repair but ""we are talking months rather than days and weeks"". Parts of Nottingham railway station have been boarded up following Friday's fire Passengers are being advised tocheck the latest travel information,externalbefore travelling to the station. The fire, which damaged the main concourse roof and toilets, caused major disruption to services on Friday. It took 60 firefighters to bring the blaze under control and the station remained closed for the rest of the day. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Care children lists sent to taxi firms,"Leicester City Council told taxi firms not to open or read the information Details of ""hundreds, potentially thousands"" of vulnerable people, including children, have been emailed to taxi firms by a council. Leicester City Council accidentally sent the spreadsheet to 27 companies while getting tenders to transport people in care or with special needs. Councillor Ross Grant said the news made him feel ""sick in my stomach"". The authority said it took data protection ""very seriously"" and had launched an investigation. The original email was sent on Tuesday morning, and a recall email was sent just over 24 hours later. The recall said: ""[The original] email had a large file attached to it called 'Taxi Tender Live v 3' that contains passenger information and was sent in error to your company. ""Please delete this email. Please then delete the email from your ""Deleted items"" folder. Please do not try to open or read it."" It then stated disclosing any information from the email was a breach of the Data Protection Act. The council said ""much more limited"" information was usually shared with outside firms Mr Grant said he felt ""sick in my stomach"" that ""hundreds, potentially thousands"" of people could be involved. ""We are talking children the court has taken action to protect from someone who would put them at risk and the council is potentially the organisation leaking their address,"" he added. ""There is no guarantee this has not been copied and spread, we cannot put the genie back in the bottle. ""I am not happy at all, I have had no answers to my questions from the council and if I don't get some I will be taking it to a higher level."" A spokesperson for Labour-controlled Leicester City Council said: ""Information would normally be shared with taxi companies on a much more limited basis. ""We take data protection and confidentiality very seriously and took immediate action, contacting all of the firms and asking them to delete the information.

A woman's choice - sexual favours or homelessness,"Khristen Sellers: ""I was trying to fix my life. And this put a halt on it."" Across the US, sexual harassment at the hands of landlords, property managers and others in the housing industry can drive poor women and their children into homelessness. It is a problem badly understood and virtually unstudied. Khristen Sellers needed a home. The previous few years had been a struggle. She'd left an abusive relationship, been arrested, wandered out and then back into her children's lives. Just as she seemed to be getting back on track, a probation violation sent Sellers to prison for the first time. After five months, she returned to her hometown of Laurinburg, North Carolina. She was broke and homeless, starting over at the age of 29. She slept on couches. She got a job at a supermarket, then another at a fast-food restaurant. ""I'm walking to these jobs trying to, you know, stay afloat,"" she recalls. So when Four-County Community Services - a local housing agency - offered her an opportunity to move into a white panelled, three-bedroom trailer home on the outskirts of town, she readily accepted. That's when the trouble started. ""I was trying to fix my life,"" she says, ""and this put a halt on it."" She had applied for the federally subsidised Housing Choice Voucher Program, better known by its former title, Section 8. In the US, 2.1 million low-income households rent from private landlords using the vouchers, and their rent is partially or fully covered by funds from the federal government. Laurinburg is located in one of the most economically depressed counties in North Carolina. Vouchers are coveted, and some people languished on the waiting list for as long as 10 years. Four-County was the local agency entrusted with disbursing them. Based on need, Sellers qualified relatively quickly. Another Section 8 tenant had abandoned the double-wide trailer on Dorset Drive, and Sellers was told that if she cleaned it, she could move right in. Every morning, Sellers' mother dropped her off alone at the property. For a week, she hauled out broken furniture, pulled rotten food from the refrigerator, scrubbed dog excrement off the carpets and poisoned the cockroaches. There was extensive damage to the property that Sellers couldn't fix herself, but before the landlord would make the repairs, an inspector from Four-County had to take a look. Sellers remembers the first time the agency's inspector, a former North Carolina state police officer named Eric Pender, came to the property with a clipboard in hand. As she continued to clean, she says the conversation quickly turned from the house to Sellers' personal life. ""'Where's your boyfriend?' 'Why you don't have a man here cleaning?'"" Sellers says he asked her. ""And I'm like, 'I don't have time for a man, I just came out of prison, I'm trying to get my life right.'"" Undeterred, Sellers says Pender asked her if she ""gives head"" or if she'd ever been paid for sex, implying that his signature on the inspection was the only thing standing between her and a place to live. At one point, she says he called her into the bathroom under the pretence of showing her a needed repair. She says he pulled her in by her hips, blocked the doorway and took out his penis. She managed to push him out of the way. Sellers was horrified. And she says it was the first in a string of incidents. ""It was continuous,"" she says. ""He would never sign. Each time he came, it was like, 'You owe me before I sign this paper. And you gotta make a decision.'"" She worried she would lose her voucher if she complained to the housing agency. She tried to hire a lawyer who told her to come back when she had witnesses. A private investigator told her she couldn't afford him. A colleague she confided in thought she was doing Sellers a favour by going to Pender's boss. The house Khristen Sellers was offered by Four-County But the boss told Pender, who confronted Sellers as she was raking the backyard of Dorset Drive. She managed to secretly record the conversation on her mobile phone. On the recording, Pender said he heard Sellers was ""getting tired of me asking you for pussy"". ""Be careful who you talk to,"" he said. ""You're on this programme because you need it and you done waited a long time. But it's so easy to lose it."" Just before the recording ends, he added, ""We straight - well, we almost straight. You'll take care of me later on."" Sellers says there were moments when she considered giving in. After all, he was a respected local official, a former cop. She was a homeless single mother with a criminal record. ""If I go tell somebody he said that, he'll say 'No, I didn't.' Who gonna look like the liar?"" she says. ""I just didn't know what to do at that point and I needed somewhere to stay."" Standing in a pile of dead leaves in the backyard of Dorset Drive, Sellers felt utterly alone. What she didn't know at the time was she was just one of dozens of women who had gone through something similar. In a post-Harvey Weinstein and #MeToo world, most people are well aware sexual harassment occurs in the workplace. But across the US, women are subjected to it in a far more intimate setting - their homes. Every year, hundreds of state and federal civil lawsuits are filed against landlords, property owners, building superintendents and maintenance workers alleging persistent, pervasive sexual harassment and misconduct, covering everything from sexual remarks to rape. This includes so-called ""quid pro quo"" sexual harassment, wherein the perpetrator demands sex in exchange for rent or repairs. ""In employment, you leave. It's horrible, but you can leave and go home,"" says Kelly Clarke, a supervising lawyer at the Fair Housing Project of Legal Aid of North Carolina. ""This is somebody who can invade your home."" Martisha Coleman, a young mother who brought a case against her landlord in East St Louis, Illinois, says after repeatedly rebuffing advances, she became so scared of him that she started pushing her bed against the door at night. She says he retaliated when she wasn't home. (The case is awaiting a judge's ruling.) ""He unlocked my door, came inside my house, looked through my items and left a five-day eviction [notice] on my bed."" Situations like Coleman's are virtually unstudied. There has never been a comprehensive national survey of tenants to track the frequency of sexual harassment in housing, or to determine where or to whom it occurs most often. Most advocates and experts believe poor women and women of colour are disproportionately affected, though that is based mainly on experiential evidence and a single, 30-year-old study. Advocates say victims who are undocumented or who do not speak English are also easy targets, as are women fleeing domestic violence. The lack of affordable housing stock in major American cities compounds the desperate circumstances renters can find themselves in. A single eviction can preclude victims from huge swathes of the public and private housing market. ""The link is vulnerability and poverty,"" says Kate Sablosky Elengold, a clinical associate law professor at University of North Carolina who prosecuted sexual harassment cases for the justice department's civil rights division. ""The risk to a woman standing up against it is homelessness."" Judy tried to put what happened in Laurinburg behind her. After all, she'd already lost the tiny red house with the blue shutters on the east side of town, and was forced to move back home to Baltimore, Maryland, crammed into a single apartment with her adult children. Besides that, she was ashamed. (Judy requested the BBC not publish her full name). But then a cousin called to tell her about a story in the local Laurinburg newspaper - Eric Pender and his boss John Wesley at Four-County Community Services were in big trouble. Three women were accusing the men of years of sexual misconduct at the housing agency. Judy pulled up the story, and Googled Craig Hensel, the young lawyer who had finally heard Khristen Sellers' story and agreed to file a lawsuit. Pender was also criminally charged with simple assault. ""I gave [Hensel] a call,"" Judy says. ""I told him something similar happened to me."" Around 2008, Judy moved to Laurinburg and received a housing voucher from Four-County. She was looking for a change of pace - a country lifestyle, far away from big city problems. Four years later, she says she made a crucial mistake - she signed on a lease for a public housing unit in Baltimore for her daughter. Receiving federal housing benefits in two places constitutes fraud. A caseworker at Four-County Community Services informed Judy the voucher for the little red house would be terminated. The former offices of Four-County Community Services in Laurinburg, North Carolina Judy left that meeting distraught, and says that's when she bumped into Pender. She says he offered his help. Pender had always had something to say about her looks, her shape, the smell of the oil she wore, Judy says. Twice, she claims, he groped her buttocks. This time, she alleges, he told her he could help with her voucher situation if, ""one hand washes the other. You help me out, I'll help you out."" Judy says it was clear to her that he was talking about sex. ""I felt like my back was up against the wall,"" she recalls. ""I needed to keep a roof over me and my son's heads. I didn't have the money."" According to Judy, Pender came to her home after hours for a single sexual encounter. She assumed Pender would be able to do something to save the voucher. Instead, she says, he did nothing and the voucher was terminated. ""This man used me,"" she says. ""I felt humiliated."" These two women both say they were assaulted by Four-County employees. They did not want their faces shown One of the last times she saw Pender, Judy made two secret recordings on her cell phone. In the recording, he made comments about her coming to his home, and referenced oral sex. She says she thought she could play it to Pender's girlfriend to get back at him, but never did. ""I didn't try to tell nobody,"" she says. ""Who wants to be publicly known for sleeping with people [for something]? That's like being a whore or a prostitute. That's how I felt."" But months after her move back to Baltimore, she read that not only were three other women claiming sexual harassment, one had also acquiesced to the sexual demands ""out of fear"" her benefits would be negatively impacted if she refused. ""I can point a finger now because I got three more pointing back at him."" Even if a sexual harassment complaint eventually reaches the proper authorities, the act of reporting can lead to an eviction. That's what Tonya Robinson says happened to her, after she was assaulted by a property manager at an apartment complex in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Twenty-six women later came forward with similar allegations. ""When he touched me, I ran down and told the neighbour who'd been living there for years,"" she says. ""I was kicked out of the apartment, my children and I during the winter time."" Victims can report sexual harassment to state and municipal civil rights entities, private fair housing agencies - like local legal aid offices - and to federal agencies like the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). But the process varies from state to state and agencies often have different requirements in terms of time an investigation can take and level of confidentiality. Civil legal proceedings can take years, and evictions only a matter of weeks. Besides, many victims are simply unaware they can make a formal complaint. Shanna Smith, president of the National Fair Housing Alliance, says women often tell her, ""I didn't know I could do something about it."" In October 2017, the justice department announced a new Sexual Harassment in Housing Initiative which aims to lower barriers to reporting. They opened a dedicated hotline for sexual harassment in housing complaints. New interventions and trainings are being proposed for local police departments and landlord-tenant courts. A nationwide roll-out of these solutions could come later this year. ""Sexual harassment in housing is illegal and unacceptable. Too many women today are being taken advantage of by their landlords,"" Associate Attorney General Rachel Brand said in a statement to the BBC. ""The justice department has made helping these women a priority."" But successfully making a complaint is just the first step. For Khristen Sellers and the other women, it was just the beginning of the ordeal. ""The breadth of it was so shocking,"" says Jessica Clarke, a former DOJ lawyer who eventually handled the Laurinburg case. ""When the person who has the keys to your door, who controls where you live is a predator, there's nothing scarier."" Although Sellers and her lawyer now had other women like Judy willing to go public with their stories, it became clear it was going to be a difficult road forward. Not only did Pender continue in his job as usual, but one of the complainants was called to Four-County's offices and suddenly recanted. Less than a month later, the woman received a housing voucher. Four-County also attempted to terminate Sellers' voucher, purportedly over the shoddy condition of the trailer on Dorset Drive. Termination letters sent to Sellers were signed by Pender himself. Her lawyers, which now included Kelly Clarke from Legal Aid of North Carolina, petitioned for restraining orders against Pender and the agency. ""This is clear-cut retaliation,"" Clarke told the local press at the time. ""They're targeting Khristen to scare the other women into keeping quiet."" But by then, the floodgates were open. Women were coming forward with allegations spanning years, and many pointed to Pender's boss, John Wesley. Samantha Oxendine alleges that in 2010, she brought her newborn son with her to Wesley's office to inquire about a voucher. She claims he told her she could have a voucher that day if she agreed to ""come over here and suck it"". Oxendine picked up her son and fled. She told her mother Jill, who went back to Four-County's office to complain. Samantha Oxendine, right, and her mother Jill ""I told them my young 'un didn't have to drop to her knees for nothing,"" recalls Jill. ""I was ready to kill them."" Around the same time, Jennifer Dial was hoping to move out of a dangerous apartment complex into a house she could only afford if she had a voucher. She says Wesley repeatedly asked her to dance for him, or show him her underwear in exchange for one. She never went back and sent the agency a letter of complaint. ""I had to have somewhere for my kids to stay, and all you're worried about is seeing what kind of underwear I have on,"" says Dial. ""It was disrespectful."" Neither Oxendine nor Dial ever heard back, and never received vouchers. Oxendine and her children continued to live with family. Dial gave up on the dream of the house and moved to an apartment only to find it was infested with bed bugs. She lost all her belongings. Jennifer Dial Latina Covington knew she could complain to HUD, the government's housing department. She called and told them that Wesley was pressuring her for sex in exchange for a voucher for her disabled brother. On one occasion she alleges he slipped his hand into her pants as they were standing talking. She says HUD referred her to a local housing nonprofit. But for some reason the nonprofit never returned her calls and her brother stayed on the waiting list for seven years. ""I felt like nobody was hearing me,"" she says. ""Emotionally it really broke me down."" The scant data available on sexual harassment in housing seem to show small numbers of cases like this each year. In the US in 2016, private fair housing organisations recorded 137 complaints of sexual harassment from their clients. The US Department of Housing and Urban Development acted on 28 cases, and HUD-funded fair housing assistance programmes around the country filed 130 cases. But those numbers may be deceptively low, since a single complaint can reveal dozens of additional victims. ""Finding one victim often leads to finding two, six, 16, 23 - in many of these cases we uncover ongoing harassment of many women over a period of years,"" says Sara Pratt, the former deputy assistant secretary for Enforcement and Programs at HUD. ""That is unfortunately all too common."" The BBC requested data from state civil and human rights agencies and found many cannot easily report how many of their housing cases involve allegations of sexual harassment each year. Of the state agencies that did provide that information, the number of cases per year were in single or low-two-digit numbers. California was the exception, recording dozens of complaints each year, including 159 complaints in 2015. Lawsuits brought in the private housing market can be settled in complete secrecy, since defendants often demand confidentiality agreements, not unlike the nondisclosure agreements Harvey Weinstein reportedly used to keep women from speaking publicly. ""Powerful men know they have the right to make that request,"" says Fred Freiberg, executive director of the Fair Housing Justice Center in New York City. ""I have a strong view that confidentiality agreements are counterproductive and don't serve the public interest."" In total, 16 women came forward in Laurinburg, and of those, six said they had engaged in sex or other sexual activity with one or both men. The women said that over the years, they had been reporting Pender to Wesley, or Wesley to Pender, without knowing there were allegations against both men. In a call with the BBC, Wesley says he ""categorically denies"" all the allegations that were made against him, though he declined to go through them individually. He says the women were motivated by money. ""They lied. There's no better way to say it,"" he says. ""Either they're lying or I'm lying."" Pender did not respond to requests for comment. He denied all the allegations throughout the legal proceedings. In February 2014, two years into the lawsuit, Four-County was in a state of upheaval. A state audit revealed the agency was riddled with nepotism, and misspent $4.8m (Â£3.5m) worth of taxpayer money on things like gym memberships and bar tabs. One executive director was fired, and the organisation changed its name to Southeastern Community and Family Services. Lawyer Kelly Clarke One thing did not change - Pender and Wesley still had jobs. Coming forward had been difficult, but so was staying forward in a tiny town like Laurinburg. Other women came up to Sellers to tell her she was putting their housing in jeopardy. She says members of her church questioned her to the point where she stopped going. Rumours flew about possible retaliation. An abandoned home across the street from Sellers' mysteriously went up in flames one night. ""I wanted to give up many times,"" she says. ""It became too scary."" A lengthy case of this nature is typical. Gustavo Velasquez, former assistant secretary of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at HUD under the Obama administration, says when he first joined the department in 2014, sexual harassment investigations were dragging on for years. ""We were able to bring that number down to nine months. But it really should be 90 days,"" he says. HUD became aware of the Laurinburg case about a year and a half after Sellers first came forward. They sent their investigators to Laurinburg, who sent their findings to the justice department. Then the DOJ began its own investigation. ""There were several women who would tell me the kind of things they would do, because they had small children,"" says a DOJ lawyer who worked on the investigation. ""No one should have to make that decision. No one should have to make that choice."" By the time the inquiry concluded, 71 additional women came forward with complaints deemed credible by the justice department. In December 2014, the DOJ filed a federal lawsuit against Four-County. If you have been a victim of sexual harassment in housing in the US, here is how to report it: Call the Department of Justice's dedicated hotline for sexual harassment complaints: 1-844-380-6178 or Email fairhousing@usdoj.gov Call the US Department of Housing and Urban Development Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at 1-800-669-9777 Contact a local fair housing centre - find yours at nationalfairhousing.org Pender was placed on administrative leave; Wesley was required to be accompanied by a female employee on any home visits. Security cameras were installed in the offices. But the agency refused to resolve with the DOJ, calling the lawsuit ""frivolous"". Finally, in the summer of 2015, HUD sent letters threatening to withhold Four-County's funding if it did not address the sexual harassment complaints. Both Pender and Wesley were finally terminated, and soon afterward, the lawsuit was settled for $2.7m. At the time, it was the largest settlement of its kind in federal housing law history. The agency's new executive director Ericka J Whitaker released a statement: ""I make no pretence of knowing what actually occurred with all parties allegedly involved in this case. What I do know is that fighting an ongoing legal battle is unproductive for the agency."" The Laurinburg case illustrates a larger point of concern - housing authorities and agencies who disburse federal housing benefits are not obligated to record or report the number of harassment complaints they receive each year. They are independent agencies who, in some cities, oversee hundreds of thousands of tenants. Many victims erroneously assume that their only recourse is to complain to the authority itself. In recent years, the justice department has brought several cases against housing authorities not only for sexual harassment of tenants by employees, but also for failure to act on complaints. A case against the Housing Authority of Baltimore City brought by private lawyers resulted in an $7.9m settlement for a total of 113 victims. In the Baltimore case, women alleged they had complained to the housing authority for years. A separate union investigation corroborated the claims. But the accused maintenance workers continued on the job while the union safety officer who performed the investigation was fired. The men were not terminated until after the lawsuit was filed. The demographic make-up of subsidised housing in the US may create a uniquely vulnerable population. National figures show that 74% of Section 8 and public housing units are female-headed households, and one-third of those have children. Public housing policy often bars or severely limits overnight guests, a rule designed to prevent overcrowding that also translates into women who are on their own the majority of the time. ""These maintenance men can be pretty well assured there aren't going to be men around to do anything about what's going on,"" says Cary Hansel, the lawyer who represented the victims in the Baltimore case. The BBC reached out to the 16 largest public housing authorities and housing voucher programmes in the US to find out what their reporting policy is for tenants and whether or not they track complaint numbers year to year. Although most respondents said their staff undergo sexual harassment training, procedures for taking tenant complaints varied. Some had no specific policy, some do not keep track of the number of complaints coming in and justified that by saying the number of reports each year are too low. Major US cities are responsible for hundreds of thousands of tenants - and many don't have standardised tenant sexual harassment complaint policies The Boston Housing Authority has a civil rights hotline, and policies that require its staff to report any complaint to the police. The Miami-Dade authority says tenants experiencing sexual harassment should call its ""fraud investigation hotline"". The Chicago Public Housing Authority, the third-largest public housing provider in the country, would not even comment on whether they have a policy. ""Public housing authorities are terrible at doing this,"" says Velasquez, the former HUD official. ""I think housing authorities in large cities - they don't have an excuse."" However, because there is so little research about sexual harassment in housing, it is difficult to say for certain if the problem occurs more often in public housing than the private housing market. Property owners can become landlords without any of the training that public housing employees have to undergo. Since the early 1990s, the majority of the sexual harassment cases brought by the justice department have been against private landlords. The BBC filed a Freedom of Information Act request in May of 2016 for HUD complaints of sexual harassment going back to 2010, in the hope of parsing out any trends. A year and a half later, the request has yet to be met. When the 16 original plaintiffs gathered for lengthy mediation and settlement conferences, some were meeting for the first time. ""We pretty much bonded real quickly,"" recalls Judy. ""People started opening up and sharing their stories of what happened."" Sitting in the conference rooms of generic hotels, Sellers says she was struck by the fact that they all had a back story - abusive relationships, substance abuse problems, criminal records - some of which would have shown up on their housing application background checks. ""It's like we all had something that they could feed off of,"" she says, ""and we all needed housing."" ""He told my children he'd be their stepdaddy,"" recalls Candace Stewart, another plantiff in the Laurinburg case. ""I didn't want him to come back to my house to do nothing."" In his response to BBC, Wesley saw things in reverse order, that the women's troubles both before and after the case were evidence they're unreliable, untrustworthy witnesses. ""We think that's one of the reasons these cases are so underreported, because the defendants say exactly what John Wesley said to you,"" says a senior official who is working on the justice department's sexual harassment initiative. ""These women know how they're perceived in society."" Under the Laurinburg settlement -  in which neither the agency nor Pender or Wesley had to admit liability - the men will never be allowed to work in public housing again. If they choose to become private landlords, they must hire an independent manager, subject to federal approval. In some cases, private landlords can be barred from participating in federally-funded voucher programmes. Anna Maria FarÃ­as, assistant secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at HUD, says her office is working on new policies to ensure once someone is fired from a housing authority for sexual harassment, they cannot join another one. In truth, the Laurinburg settlement could only fix certain aspects of the women's lives. Kelly Clarke heard from one parent who said the money was the worst thing that could have happened to their daughter, who slipped back into a drug addiction. Another one of the plaintiffs was nearly killed after her abusive boyfriend shot her in the chest. But others flourished. Judy enrolled in school and achieved her dream of earning her high school diploma. Samantha Oxendine bought a three-bedroom trailer one door down from her mother's, paid in full. ""Right now, I know my kids got a roof over their heads that they'll always have,"" she says. Sellers moved an hour-and-a-half away from Laurinburg with her children to a quiet, tree-lined street in Greensboro, North Carolina. She keeps her three-bedroom split level home immaculate, the walls decorated with inspirational quotes and framed family photos. It seems like a world away from the decrepit trailer in Laurinburg where Eric Pender entered her life. ""I'm glad it's over,"" she says. ""I hope he realises what he's done at this point. I don't know if he has."" Sellers now works in mental health services and, in particular, with men and women returning home from prison. Her oldest daughter is about to head off for college. She says she still suffers intense anxiety as a result of what happened. She lost a lot of friends in the course of the case, and keeps to herself. But here in her home, Sellers says she finally has a sanctuary. ""It's peace to be able to relax and feel like you're home,"" she says. ""This is mine.""

Trump's 'racist slur' prompts fury,"This video can not be played 'Mr President, are you a racist?' US President Donald Trump has sparked outrage by reportedly using crude language to describe foreign countries in an Oval Office meeting. Mr Trump insists he did not insult Haitians and appeared to deny calling any nations ""shitholes"", as was reported, prompting a global outcry. Democratic Senator Dick Durbin said Mr Trump called African countries ""shitholes"" and used ""racist"" language. But two Republicans present said they could not remember those comments. Senators Tom Cotton and David Perdue, of Arkansas and Georgia, said they heard the president ""call out"" what they described as ""the imbalance in our current immigration system"". Amid widespread coverage of his remarks at the private meeting with lawmakers to discuss immigration legislation on Thursday, Mr Trump on Friday tweeted that his language at the meeting had been ""tough"". But he added that the words attributed to him were ""not the language used"". This video can not be played Dick Durbin: ""Trump said these hate-filled things, and he said them repeatedly"" Many US media outlets reported the comments on Thursday, quoting witnesses or people briefed on the meeting. The White House did not deny them. ""I cannot believe that in the history of the White House, in that Oval Office, any president has ever spoken the words that I personally heard our president speak yesterday,"" Mr Durbin told reporters on Friday. House Speaker Paul Ryan, a top Republican, said the reported comments were ""unfortunate"" and ""unhelpful. Two views: Are Trump's views racist or not? Hillary Clinton, who lost to Mr Trump in the 2016 presidential election, said the country had been subjected to his ""ignorant, racist views of anyone who doesn't look like him"". Mr Trump ignored press questions about the issue as he signed a proclamation declaring a holiday in honour of civil rights hero Martin Luther King Jr - as presidents do every year. He said Americans were celebrating that ""self-evident truth"" that ""no matter what the colour of our skin or the place of our birth, we are all created equal by God"". Mr Trump's reported remarks came as lawmakers visited him on Thursday to discuss a bipartisan proposal that would impose new restrictions on immigration but protect the so-called ""Dreamers"" - hundreds of thousands immigrants brought to the US illegally as children - from deportation. Mr Trump was said to have told them that instead of granting temporary residency to citizens of countries hit by natural disasters, war or epidemics, the US should instead be taking in migrants from countries like Norway. ""Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?"" the Washington Post quoted him as saying, in remarks first reported to be about Haiti, El Salvador and African nations. How countries have reacted What has Trump said about your country? Democrats decry 'cruel' immigration order Mr Durbin said that when Mr Trump was told that the largest groups of immigrants with Temporary Protected Status (TPS) were from El Salvador, Honduras and Haiti, the president responded: ""Haitians? Do we need more Haitians?"" But in another tweet on Friday the president denied that he insulted Haitians. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

On US TV, some broadcasters gave content warnings or avoided saying the word altogether. Fox News used asterisks to obscure the offensive word along the bottom of the screen, but CNN and MSNBC carried it in full. Around the world, journalists reporting in other languages faced the question of how to translate what Mr Trump had said. In French, headlines featured ""pays de merde"", using the expletive to refer to the countries but without the word ""hole"" In Spanish, ""paÃ­ses de mierda"" was used, similar to the French, as well as ""paÃ­ses de porquerÃ­a"", which means ""trash countries"" In German, ""Drecksloch"" , which literally means dirt hole but like the word used by Mr Trump is considered vulgar In Dutch, one newspaper used ""achterlijk"" (backward) as its headline In Japanese, a word that translates as ""outdoor toilet"" was used In Portuguese, one outlet used a word that translates as 'pigsty', while others translated the quote literally This video can not be played What the world thinks of Trump Was Trump's alleged slur actually racist?

Comedy actress Bella Emberg diesThe actress is known for her character Blunder Woman in the 1980's TV programme The Russ Abbot Show.3m4 minutes agoUK,"Tributes have been paid to the ""huge comedy talent"" Bella Emberg, who has died, aged 80. The British actress will be remembered for her character Blunder Woman, the comic sidekick of hapless superhero Cooperman in the 1980s television programme The Russ Abbot Show. She was ""a woman of immense warmth and generosity"", Abbot said. Emberg also appeared on The Benny Hill Show, Z Cars and Doctor Who in a television career spanning six decades. ""She was not only a great sport but a huge comedy talent. I count myself very lucky to have worked alongside her,"" Abbot added. ""She really was a one-off."" In an interview with the Daily Mirror,externallast year, Emberg insisted the Blunder Woman character had been a blessing, not a curse, despite meaning that when the show finished in 1996 she could not get work. ""I went for jobs and they'd say: 'We'd love to hire you but you're too well known with Russ,'"" she told the paper.

Dugdale reveals I'm a Celebrity payThe former Scottish Labour leader received the money for her recent appearance on I'm a Celebrity.10h10 hours agoScotland politics,"Kezia Dugdale received a fee of Â£70,000 for her recent appearance on I'm a Celebrity, she has disclosed. The former Scottish Labour leader also declared between Â£10,000 and Â£15,000 worth of travel, accommodation and living expenses, which were paid by ITV. She has donated Â£5,100 of her appearance fee, as well as Â£2,500 of her MSP salary, to charity. Ms Dugdale was formally reprimanded by Labour last month for her absence. She has now published details in theScottish Parliament's register of interests,external. The entry includes estimates of the travel and accommodation Ms Dugdale received, as well as a daily payment of 150 Australian dollars which she was given for living expenses while not in the camp. This brought the total sum published in the entry to between Â£80,000 and Â£85,000, including her Â£70,000 fee. Dugdale reprimanded over I'm a Celebrityy Dugdale says jungle was 'political gamble' A spokesman for Ms Dugdale said she had donated a total of Â£5,100 from her fee to the charities Who Cares? Scotland, Glasgow Women's Aid, and the Archie Foundation. Prior to appearing on the show, she also donated Â£2,500 of her MSP salary to the Rock Trust, an Edinburgh-based charity which supports young people at risk of homelessness. The spokesman added: ""Ms Dugdale received a fee from ITV for appearing on the TV show of Â£70,000. ""Income Tax has been paid both in the UK and in Australia due to the nature of the earnings, which was received in instalments. After tax, this sum is around Â£45,000."" Ms Dugdale said she was pleased that a number of charities who do ""amazing work across Scotland"" would benefit for her stint in the jungle. She added: ""I'm delighted to be back in the parliament serving my constituents across the Lothians."" The Scottish Conservatives said Ms Dugdale's charity donations were a ""drop in the ocean"" compared to the fee she received, and described her appearance on the show as a ""shameful episode"". Ms Dugdale was reprimanded by Scottish Labour when she returned to the Scottish Parliament last month Her time in the Australian jungle saw Ms Dugdale crawl through a tank full of fish guts that had ""Sickola Sturgeon"" written on the side. The politician was introduced as one of two late-entry campmates on the ITV reality show in November, before becoming the second person evicted after lasting 11 days in the jungle. News that she had agreed to become a contestant broke just hours before Scottish Labour was due to unveil her successor as leader. It subsequently emerged thatshe had not asked the party for permissionto take part. Ms Dugdale said she wanted to use her time in the jungle to promote ""Labour values"", but was heavily criticised by several colleagues. There had been speculation that Ms Dugdale faced a possible suspension from Labour when she returned to Scotland in December. But she was instead given a formal reprimand following a meeting with new Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard, and was told she would face no further disciplinary action.

Is this racist or not?,"This video can not be played 'Mr President, are you a racist?' US President Donald Trump's reported reference to Haiti and African nations as ""shitholes"" has sparked global outrage. But was it racist? Charlton McIlwain, professor and dean at NYU, and Drew Liquerman of Republicans Overseas, offer contradicting opinions on the matter. Mr McIlwain:Yesterday, Donald Trump said African and Haitian immigrants hail from ""shithole countries"".A little black girl and child of Haitian immigrants I know overheard. Unprompted, and defiant she responded to her mother: ""Donald Trump is a shithole!"" The word itself was foreign to her, but she intuitively understood the words were derogatory, demeaning - racist. In Trump's words she recognised a constellation of associations and inferences that Trump drew on to make this so. A statement is racist when it explicitly denigrates and/or asserts as true a negative, longstanding stereotype about an entire group of people, signalled by the colour of their skin. ""Shithole"" fits the bill in the vilest way. Those who manage with a straight face to say Trump's words were not racist no doubt will point out that he did not specify that black people from these countries are shitholes. But, he did not have to. We have longstanding and differential associations between the colours white and black. For much of our recent history, white has always represented all that is pure, clean, desirable. These associations are found in the language of our dictionaries, the one-time definition of Africa as the ""dark continent"",and the way we demarcated slaves from non-slaves throughout the slave trade. These associations define our beauty standards, animated through film and television's past and present. And, these colour associations still dominate our perceptions of leadership, images of success and attributions of worth and value. Because of these longstanding and pervasive associations between black and white, Trump need only connecta few dots to express his racism. Denigrate immigrants from countries like Africa and Haiti as shitholes with no value, then specify their opposite - people from ""Norway"".Even a little girl can see what the primary difference is between the two. This video can not be played Dick Durbin: ""Trump said these hate-filled things, and he said them repeatedly"" Mr Liquerman:While elite Washington media and political class is outraged over President Trump's reported remarks on immigration, it's unclear what he actually said (the White House has disputed Senator Durbin's account). President Trump's alleged harsh characterisation of Haiti is certainly uncouth, but nothing suggests it's racist. Haiti is indisputably the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere and has serious disease and development problems, according to the WHO and UN. Those same organisations (and American leftists) consistently cite Norway as a prosperous, successful country. With that established, it's perfectly rational for any country - including the US - to prefer educated and high-skilled immigrants, and, unsurprisingly, those immigrants disproportionately come from wealthy, developed countries. If President Trump had suggested we turn away all Haitians - even the educated, high-skilled ones who would help our country and economy, as many immigrants from Haiti do - it would be a different story. But he has made clear that he wants help the economy by bringing in the best immigrants, wherever they may come from. Country of origin should neither make nor break anyone's immigration application, as there are high-skilled and talented citizens in every country who could contribute a lot to the US. But it's foolish to believe they are as prevalent in Haiti, where the literacy rate is around 60%, as they are in Norway, where the literacy rate is nearly 100%. Ultimately, this episode is a case study in Democrats' bad faith. Thankfully, informed Americans are too smart to fall into this trap, the coming reforms to US immigration policy will reflect the views of the Trump administration, the GOP, and the American people, not Washington insiders.
