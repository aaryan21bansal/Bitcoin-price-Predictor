The plan is outlined ina two-page memorandum obtained by Buzzfeed News.,external The DEA's actions are typically limited to enforcing drug-related federal crime, but on Sunday it received approval to go beyond the agency's mandate to ""perform other law enforcement duties"", according to the report.

"No early return for UK tourists, says Spain","Spain's tourism minister has cast doubt on the prospect of an early return by UK holidaymakers to Spanish beaches. MarÃ­a Reyes Maroto said British coronavirus figures ""still have to improve"" before Spain could receive tourists from the UK. Last week, the Spanish government saidforeign visitors would no longer have to undergo a two-week quarantinefrom 1 July. But Ms Reyes Maroto said tourist activity would be resumed ""gradually"". ""For Spain, it is very important that the first tourists are tourists who are in the same epidemiological situation as us, and that they are able to fly safely,"" she said in a statement. ""Regarding the United Kingdom, there have been talks with tour operators but British data still have to improve, because it's important to ensure that the person comes well and then returns well.""

Aberystwyth University is planning to bring students
back to its campus from the beginning of the next academic year in September. The
university aims to make in-person teaching as safe as possible with measures such as a socially-distanced campus and a ""flexible teaching provision on-campus with both in-person
and online teaching delivery"". Prof Tim Woods, Pro Vice-Chancellor for Learning Teaching and Student Experience at
the university, said: ""Our priority is to ensure the safety
and well-being of all our students, staff and the wider community. âThe
detailed arrangements are being developed in close collaboration with Studentsâ
Union representatives, as well as in discussions with Ceredigion Council, Hywel
Dda Health Board, the Welsh Government and UK-wide stakeholders. ""This includes
working with the relevant authorities on implications for our international
students. The ongoing feedback from our students, along with other partners,
will be essential as we develop and move forward with our plans.â A further 111 deaths have been confirmed across the UK, Hancock adds, taking the total to 39,045. This is the lowest daily fatality figure for more than two months. Hancock says this - and the other figures - shows that the UK's action plan is ""working"" and the UK ""is winning the battle against the virus"". Despite the significant progress, he says the UK cannot let up on social distancing or other measures as the ""disease is not done yet"". Health Secretary Matt Hancock has told the UK government coronavirus press conference there were 1,570 new recorded cases of people testing positive on Sunday. This is the lowest figure since the lockdown began on 23 March. He says this shows the virus is being brought under control, allowing the modest steps to relax restrictions, which came into effect earlier. Hancock says the number of patients on mechanical ventilators is also at its lowest level since 23 March.  Local Democracy Reporting Service More than double the number of care and nursing home residents died in Carmarthenshire than the same period last year, the county councilâs social services director has said. Jake Morgans said 47 residents died in the 30 days leading up to May 15 in 2020 - compared with 22 in 2019 - and analysis indicates the extra deaths were coronavirus-related. His report to Monday's executive board meeting said Carmarthenshire's picture looked broadly similar to that of south and south-east Wales. âAt the time of writing we have 11 residential care and nursing homes in the public and private sector who have symptomatic residents or confirmed cases of Covid-19,â said Mr Morgans' report. He said testing and the supply of personal protective equipment for care and nursing homes had increased - and infection control measures had also been enhanced. The report said a small number of care and nursing homes were under âsignificantâ financial pressure, adding: âDetermination of further funding from Welsh Government to support the sector beyond May will be essential to avoid a significant collapse of care homes across the county.â  The Fare family have hardly been out for 12 weeks as three of the five in their household have beenshielding from coronavirus. From today in Wales,people who have been shielding can go out to exercise- but with two daughters suffering from cystic fibrosis and a mother-in-law being shielded, David Fare is playing it safe. ""We're not in a major hurry to dash out,"" said David from Conwy. ""We'll be erring on the side of caution over the next few weeks."" Imogen, eight, and four-year-old Annabelle's condition means ""the entire family in practice"" are shielding. ""There's no point in three people staying at home if the other two go out shopping and bring home the virus,"" David said. Many of Walesâ biggest car dealers have banded together to protest against still not being allowed to open for sales, unlike their competitors over the border in England. Eighteen dealerships have written a joint letter to First Minister Mark Drakeford voicing their âgreat concern and disappointmentâ that they cannot sell vehicles, while English rivals reopened today. They warn of a threat to jobs and businesses, and claim âcountless customersâ will choose to buy vehicles in England rather than Wales in coming weeks. The Welsh Government said ""non-essential retail businesses"" which can meet social distancing rules should get ready to open again over the next three weeks. It said it would make a decision at its next review of the lockdown guidance, and that would depend on scientific and medical evidence. The companies' letter says the Welsh Government's failure to allow dealership to open for sales, while the UK government has allowed English traders to do so, has âexposed the whole sector in Wales to considerable harmâ. It says the retail motor industry in Wales has a combined turnover of more than Â£3bn, and employs more than 20,000 in sales departments alone. The traders say: âConsumers change their car on average once every four years, during the next three weeks countless customers will transact with our English counterparts ending their relationships with local Welsh dealers. âIt should also be noted there is a built-up demand from the past nine weeks of lockdown eager to do business. We are confident the next three weeks' loss will be much greater than any normal period. This revenue will never be recovered."" Some dealers have continued to offer services and MOTs during lockdown. They say they are ready to reopen for sales, having invested an average Â£9,000 at each of their sites on social distancing precautions, such as signage and personal protective equipment. A car sales showroom, currently closed for business, in Blackwood Parks in Neath Port Talbot will reopen with social distancing measures in place from Thursday. The authotity wasone of eight Welsh councils to keep its parks shutduring the coronavirus lockdown. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Dros GinioBBC Radio Cymru There must be âan honest, country-wide conversationâ about ways to pay for public services after coronavirus-related financial losses, according to the leader of Cardiff council. Speaking on BBC Radio Cymru's Dros Ginio, Huw Thomas said Cardiff council's current financial situation was âworryingâ as a result of the pandemic. âOur costs over the past two months have been up by Â£20m and our income streams, which have been crucial to our budget in the past, haven't been there for the past three months,â said Mr Thomas. He explained that shutting venues such as St David's Centre and Cardiff Castle, along with the loss of income from the car parks, has meant âa financial loss of about Â£11mâ. âThere's no easy answer. If you look at the council tax, the council tax itself won't be enough to fill the deficit hole,"" Mr Thomas added. âWe have to pay for social services one way or another, and I argue that we have seen how crucial they are to the make up of our society.â Discussing the ânew worldâ that we'll find ourselves in post pandemic, Mr Thomas said he was very supportive of the âbuild back betterâ concept. âWhat can we change from this crisis to ensure that our day to day lives are healthier, fairer and more sustainable? This isn't something that central or local government can do on their own, it will require a social shift too,"" he added. âI want to encourage as many people as possible to walk, to use the bike instead of going back to using the car, especially as there will be less capacity to use public transport. âThat requires a personal commitment from all of us as citizens to make that decision â it's a challenge to us all.â A murderer serving a life sentence at Britainâs biggest jail has died in hospital after contracting coronavirus.

Mark HutchingsBBC Wales parliamentary correspondent Waving from across a river, a father saw his son for the first time since he was diagnosed with coronavirus. ""I'm the one in the red T-shirt,"" said the son. In normal times, such a location-finder would be of little help outside the home of Welsh rugby. But this was a son, making eye contact with his frail father for the first time since February, with just the River Taff between them. The Principality Stadium is now the Dragon's Heart Hospital and 86-year-old Peter Tozzo is one of those being treated on the transformed pitch. It was the red T-shirt worn by his son Simon Tozzo that caught my eye (along with his yellow cap) as I cycled past with my family group.

marked ""keep clear"". Some services will increase in
frequency, with passenger numbers limited to about 18 on a double decker

Managing Director for First Cymru, said: âOur service network has been designed
around the needs of key workers, ensuring they are able to travel to and from
work. âFrom 1 June we are increasing our
service level, as we introduce social distancing measures across our fleet. The
capacity of our vehicles will be 25%, to ensure the two-metre distance between
passengers. ""This means fewer people will be able to travel on the vehicle. To
compensate for this, we are allocating double decker buses on our busiest
routes and increasing the service frequency on others.""

Floyd died of asphyxia - private post-mortem,"This video can not be played Floyd's brother: 'That's not bringing him back' George Floyd, the African-American man whose death has sparked civil unrest, died from asphyxia (lack of oxygen), a private post-mortem examination found. He died due to compression on his neck and back by Minneapolis police officers, medical examiners hired by the Floyd family said. The findings differ from an official preliminary examination carried out by the county medical examiner. It did not find evidence of ""traumatic asphyxia or strangulation"". The official examination also said underlying health conditions played a role in Mr Floyd's death. But the two doctors hired by the Floyd family found the death was a homicide,a statement from its legal team said.,external ""The cause of death in my opinion is asphyxia, due to compression to the neck - which can interfere with oxygen going to the brain - and compression to the back, which interferes with breathing,"" Dr Michael Baden, a former New York City medical examiner and one of the pair, said at a news conference. This video can not be played 'This is pain right here' - Washington DC protests turn violent A video showing a white police officer continuing to kneel on George Floyd's neck even after he pleaded he could not breathe sparked outrage when it emerged a week ago. It has led to six consecutive days of protests around the United States and a level of civil unrest not seen this widely across the country in decades. Live updates from around the US 'Unacceptable' attacks on reporters at Floyd protests US protests: Separating fact from fiction online Benjamin Crump, a lawyer for the Floyd family, told Monday's news conference: ""Beyond doubt he would be alive today if not for the pressure applied to his neck by officer Derek Chauvin and the strain on his body by two other officers."" He added: ""The ambulance was his hearse."" Dr Baden said there was ""no other health issue that could cause or contribute to the death"". A memorial has sprung up in Minneapolis at the spot where George Floyd was arrested by police The findings contradict those of a preliminary post-mortem examination that was included in the criminal complaint against Mr Chauvin, who has been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. The medical examiner noted in that report that Mr Floyd had underlying heart conditions and said the combination of these, ""potential intoxicants in his system"" and being restrained by the officers ""likely contributed to his death"". The full official death examination is yet to be released by the office of the Hennepin County Medical Examiner. It says it is awaiting more results from laboratory studies. There have been protests in several European cities, including this one in Barcelona The Floyd family and their lawyers say the charge against Mr Chauvin should be increased to first-degree murder. They say the private post-mortem examination proves two other officers filmed kneeling on his back also contributed to his death. More than 75 cities have seen protests over what happened to George Floyd, with streets only days ago deserted because of coronavirus full of demonstrators marching shoulder to shoulder. The case has reignited deep-seated anger over police killings of black Americans and racism. It follows the high-profile cases of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Eric Garner in New York and others that have driven the Black Lives Matter movement. On Sunday, mostly peaceful demonstrations once again gave way to violence in many cities, with clashes erupting between police and protesters. Police cars were burned, buildings were torched and shops looted in several places. Dozens of cities imposed curfews but they were defied. Protesters staged a ""die-in"" in New York City's Times Square on Monday On Monday, President Trump told state governors they had been ""weak"" and had to get ""much tougher"", and utilise troops from the National Guard, thousands of whom have already been activated in two dozen states. ""You've got to arrest people, you have to track people, you have to put them in jail for 10 years and you'll never see this stuff again,"" Mr Trump said in a video conference call, according to US media. There have been scenes of violence in Washington DC in recent nights, including near the White House. How are African-Americans treated by the law? Demonstrators lit fire to buildings including a historic church known as the church of the presidents overnight on Sunday.

Here's what the situation on the ground looked like across some major US cities on Tuesday: Thousands of people across New York turned out as protests continued over the death of George Floyd In Los Angeles, placards with the phrase Black Lives Matter - a movement in protest against police killings of black people - were seen One man and his one-year-old daughter were among protesters in the Californian city of Pasadena And in Washington DC, police in riot gear were seen through the metal fence in front of the White House President Donald Trump has defended his decision to stage a photo-op outside a historic church that was caught up in the protests in Washington DC. Police cleared a peaceful protest close by to the church with tear gas and rubber bullets on Monday evening. Moments later, Trump was pictured holding a Bible outside the church. The move was criticised by religious leaders and top Democrats who accused officials of aggressively dispersing peaceful demonstrators for the photo-op.Read more about some of the shock expressed by clerics here. But in a tweet on Tuesday, Trump said: ""You got it wrong! ""If the protesters were so peaceful, why did they light the church on fire the night before? People liked my walk to this historic place of worship!""

One such city was Los Angeles, where protesters cheered as members of the military took a knee. The demonstrators had reportedly asked the soldiers to march alongside them, but they said they needed to stay in the same place. Allow Twitter content?

These soldiers - who were moved from Fort Bragg in North Carolina and Fort Drum in New York - are not currently in DC but are ""postured on military bases in the National Capitol Region"". The move was authorised by Defence Secretary Mark Esper. President Donald Trump has paid tribute to David Dorn, a black police chief who was shot dead during protests in St Louis, Missouri. Dorn, 77, was found dead in front of a pawn shop that was looted in the early hours of Tuesday. He retired from the St Louis police force in 2007 and since then had been serving as the police chief of a small town,ABC News reported,external. Trump said: ""Our highest respect to the family of David Dorn, a Great Police Captain from St. Louis."" The president said Dorn had been ""viciously shot and killed by despicable looters"".

The Department of Justice has refused to comment on a report that the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has been granted new authority to ""conduct covert surveillance"" and to collect intelligence on people participating in protests. The plan is outlined ina two-page memorandum obtained by Buzzfeed News.,external The DEA's actions are typically limited to enforcing drug-related federal crime, but on Sunday it received approval to go beyond the agency's mandate to ""perform other law enforcement duties"", according to the report. The memo indicates that DEA agents would be authorised to share this intelligence with local and state law enforcement authorities, to ""intervene"" and to ""protect both participants and spectators in the protests"", and to arrest protesters who are alleged to have violated federal law. Three DEA sources told BuzzFeed News they were troubled by the memo and see it as an example of the justice department potentially abusing its power in an attempt to smear the protesters.

Separating fact from fiction online,"Protests sparked by the death in police custody of African-American George Floyd in Minneapolis have spread across the US and to other countries. They've been documented in videos, images and posts on social media. But some of these aren't what they claim to be. The BBC's anti-disinformation team has been tracking misleading videos and conspiracy theories about the protests, which have been circulating online. So, here's what to look out for - and avoid - on your social media feeds. Rumours that the protests have been set up with potential projectiles handed out to agitators have gained traction, with thousands of posts referencing ""bricks"" on social media. Several videos that show piles of bricks along with claims that they were planted by police or the government have been watched by millions of people. Other posts pin the blame on Antifa - the left-wing group President Trump has accused of promoting the disturbances. However, there's no evidence so far to suggest foul play, nor that the protests have been somehow pre-planned. Most of the videos and images we've seen don't look particularly suspicious - it's not uncommon to see piles of bricks near building sites. Responding to a video suggesting bricks had been deliberately placed to escalate protests,San Francisco police said on Twitter,external""pallets are affiliated with a construction site and (we) have contacted the contractor to have them removed."" One police department in Boston hit back at misleading claims about a viral video of its officers unloading bricks from a van. Suggestions had been made on social media that the officers were unloading bricks from a vehicle ""to use them as an excuse"" against protesters. However, Boston's Northeastern University Police Department has tweeted that the officers had collected them ""from a damaged brick sidewalk,external"" and taken them back to the station as they were posing a safety hazard to pedestrians. Another viral video from Fayetteville, North Carolina that has racked up over a million views shows a pile of bricks in the vicinity of protests as a man says there is ""no construction"" site in the area. We've been able to geolocate the video and found images from 24 May with the same pile of bricks in the same place, long before any protests took place. In other cases, old images of piles of bricks have been re-shared of previous demonstrations elsewhere, such as from the protests in Hong Kong last year. We've seen lots of examples of old video surfacing in recent days. Among many genuine videos of brutal arrests, one that went viral yesterday was not what it seemed. The dramatic video shows a man being arrested then released by police once they'd checked his ID. A post claiming the man in the video is an ""FBI agent"" has been viewed over 4 million times on Twitter. This claim was repeated on Facebook and Instagram by others sharing the video, where it racked up millions more views. In response, Rochester Minnesota Police Department put outa statement,externalclarifying that the man is not a Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) agent. The incident took place in June last year, when he was mistaken for a wanted man. The original post of the video on Instagram includes a caption which stated the video was from the year before, and contains no mention of the FBI. A video of a teenager being violently arrested by a US police officer has generated almost 10 million views in the last few days. But the incident happened back in April - in Rancho Cordova, a city in Northern California. This wasn't made clear in the latest post that has been retweeted more than 100,000 times. It also wrongly identifies the teenager as female. The clip attracted widespread criticism at the time. Meanwhile, there is footage from the current protests which has led to allegations of police brutality. Video from the US shows police using batons and tear gas on protesters and journalists seemingly unprovoked. The last 30 minutes of George Floyd's life In pictures: Protests turn violent Why has a US city gone up in flames? This video claims to show a US police building on fire and was posted on 28 May. It's not only old - it's from 2015 - it was filmed in another country. It shows an explosion in theChinese city of Tianjin. So, why are people sharing old videos? ""The videos may be compounding the anger they are feeling and could be driven by attempts to sow division or get clicks,"" says Marianna Spring, BBC Specialist Disinformation and Social Media reporter. Speculation about who's behind the protests have been circulating online. Some claims are unsubstantiated, others totally false. First up, posts that have gone viral about George Soros. Some influential right-wing figures have made unfounded claims that the Hungarian-American billionaire is ""funding"" the demonstrations. Supporters of QAnon - a conspiracy theory about a ""deep state"" secret coup against Donald Trump - have shared similar claims. More than a million posts and memes online have repeated allegations about Mr Soros paying agitators. Mr Soros, whose Open Society Foundations provide financial support to a number of civil society groups and progressive projects around the world,has been a bogeyman of some on the right for a long time. His organisation has responded to the latest posts, tweeting that ""Mr. Soros and the Open Society Foundations oppose all violence and do not pay people to protest"". Claims have circulated online about Russia's involvement in the protests. Viral tweets with thousands of shares suggest that Russia was involved in George Floyd's death - as part of a military operation or an elaborate plot. There is no evidence to support these claims. This isn't to rule out the idea that Russia or other countries - either through state media outlets or networks of fake accounts - could be involved in stoking tensions online. Investigations into Russian interference during the 2016 US Presidential election revealed thatRussia was involved in a misinformation campaign, infiltrating groups and pages run by US activists - and that included Black Lives Matter groups.

Grindr removes 'ethnicity filter' after complaints,"Grindr was launched in 2009 Dating and hook-up app Grindr says it will remove the ""ethnicity filter"" from the next version of its app, following years of criticism from its users. The app currently lets people filter potential matches according to their age, height, weight and ethnicity. But critics say the ethnicity filter fuels discrimination and that the app does too little to tackle racism. Announcing the change, Grindr said it had a ""zero-tolerance policy for racism and hate speech"" on its platform. Grindr specialises in dating for gay, bisexual, trans, and queer people. by Ben Hunte, LGBT correspondent For years, LGBT people of colour have flagged the ethnicity filter as an issue - but they received no response from Grindr. Many even got blocked by the company. Today, change happened. But some are angry that it has only happened as a result of white people speaking up on social media. Indeed, the most-shared social media posts written to shame Grindr into action were posted by white gay men. There are also LGBT people of colour who are disappointed that this change is happening at all. Some have told me that they used the ethnicity filter to find people like themselves, perhaps not to date but for shared experiences and cultural understanding. In some cases it was needed. In February, at a queer club night for Black and Asian people, one party-goer showed me how black men did not appear on his Grindr until the white men had been filtered out. Grindr is not the only LGBT dating app to allow filtering by race. The spotlight will now move to others that have yet to take a similar stance. On 29 May, Grindr had tweeted ""Demand justice. #BlackLivesMatter"", with a link to further information. This had prompted several users to accuse the company of hypocrisy. One message saying ""remove the ethnicity filter"" was retweeted 1,000 times. Grindr later deleted its own tweet and on 1 June posted a new message explaining its change of position.

In pictures: Back to school in England,"Some children in England have gone back to school for the first time since the coronavirus  lockdown began. Many schools have opened their doors to children in Reception and Years 1 and 6. On arrival parents and children were kept 2m apart as they queued to enter school. Parents said goodbye at the door, as children headed inside to see what their socially distant classrooms were like. At this school in Mortlake, south-west London, each child was assigned their own desk, which were spaced around the classroom. Some of the older pupils shared larger desks, but were still seated apart. At this school in Watlington, in Oxfordshire, a reduced number of children were allowed into each classroom so they could maintain social distancing. Pupils are told to wash their hands regularly. At this school in Bristol a one way system is marked out on the floor. Even in the playground, the children are told to keep their distance. All photographs subject to copyright. Â© 2025 BBC.

The first morning at school since March,"Parents dropping off children at St Mary Magdalen's Catholic Primary School in west London At St Mary Magdalen's Catholic Primary School in West London, head teacher Helen Frostick has spent the last couple of weeks redesigning classrooms, reconfiguring timetables and totally rethinking school policy on everything from PE to uniform. By the time she welcomed back pupils in Reception, Year 1 and Year 6, every classroom looked very different. It's particularly striking for the youngest pupils:. ""They've got their own little tables,"" says teaching assistant, Clare Gordon. ""Obviously they're used to spending a lot of time on the carpet,"" Each table is separate, with its own tray of equipment so that the children don't need to get out of their seats so much. Reception children sit at their own little desks rather than on the carpet On arrival the parents queue with their children in the playground, which has been marked into two-metre sections, and each year group has been asked to arrive at a different time. They don't have to wait long. ""You look like you've grown, Arthur,"" says teacher Catherine Hughes to a Reception pupil who hasn't been in school since March. Head teacher Helen Frostick thinks many parents are biding their time before sending their children back to school ""Are you excited to be back?"" Ms Frostick asks another. She was expecting to welcome 70 pupils, who were last in school in late March, alongside 15 children of key workers who have been coming in throughout the lockdown - but in the end just 32 turned up. Ms Frostick is not too surprised, given ongoing concerns about the health impact of reopening schools. She believes many parents are waiting to see how it goes - so numbers may pick up in coming days. These primary school classrooms now look a little like they might have done in the 1950s with all the desks facing forward in rows, instead of being pushed together into big tables. For Year 6 pupils, it's a foretaste of the discipline they might expect when they start secondary school in September. ""I'm excited to see my friends and see everyone but not excited for the work,"" says 11-year-old Sean. He says he has kept up with the home schooling ""but it's nowhere near the amount we normally do"". Sean and Ruby are Year 6 pupils at St Mary Magdalen's His classmate Ruby, also 11, quite likes the new desk arrangement as it gives her a bit more personal space. ""It could be better because sometimes people can be annoying."" Sean agrees it will be better for concentration but says ""partner work"" will now be impossible. The school has split each class into two separate ""bubbles"" with one half in on Monday and Tuesday and the other on Thursday and Friday, which allows for a deep clean on Wednesdays. Ruby says she will miss some of the people in the other group. School will be ""way different"", she says. Dora, who is not due in until Thursday, is quite disappointed. ""I was looking forward to seeing all my friends again; it's been over two months since I last saw them at school. ""And then I found out I was only going to see three of my friends because the rest of them are put together in the other group. ""It isn't long until the end of primary school and I'm worried I wont be able to see my friends before we're all sent off to different secondary schools."" Desks are in rows facing the front One thing is for sure - hand washing is going to play a far larger part in the school day than ever before. Every classroom has its own supply of hand-sanitiser and anti-microbial wipes - and the windows are wide open to let in as much fresh air as possible to keep the virus at bay. Sophia is one of the parents who decided to bring her children to school. ""It really is best for the family,"" she says. She has managed to do some home schooling with her sons Nico, nearly five, and Alessio, 6, but it hasn't always been easy. Sophia who sent both her children back to school says it's best for her family Julia, has come to the same conclusion about her six-year-old son Max. ""I was 10% worried but 90% thinking it was the right thing to do,"" she says of her decision to send him to school. ""The main thing is for normality and for his mental health. He needs the interaction with his friends. He's been begging to come back."" Ruby and Sean agree they have definitely missed being taught by professional teachers rather than mums and dads. ""I call my mum over and she says: 'What is this?'"" says Sean - while his dad can sometimes be a bit confusing when he comes up with ""an easier way"" of doing the maths. School governor and parent Serena, whose son is also in Year 6, says she too struggled with home education as her two sons have to share a single computer. She says she is confident that the school has done a very stringent risk assessment and says her boy needs more structure in his life in the run-up to secondary school. But preparing to reopen has been challenging, as it was one thing deciding to send her own child back but far tougher to make decisions on behalf of the wider school community. ""The virus is such an unknown. It's been quite stressful. I feel a great deal of responsibility,"" says Serena. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

Violence erupts across US on sixth day of protests,"This video can not be played 'This is pain right here' - Washington DC protests turn violent Violence has erupted in cities across the US on the sixth night of protests sparked by the death in police custody of African-American George Floyd. Dozens of cities imposed curfews, but many people ignored them, leading to stand-offs and clashes. Riot police faced off with protesters in New York, Chicago, Philadelphia and LA, firing tear gas and pepper bullets to try to disperse crowds. Police vehicles were set on fire and shops were looted in several cities. The country is experiencing the most widespread racial turbulence and civil unrest since the backlash to the assassination of Martin Luther King in 1968. The outpouring of anger began last Tuesday, after a video showed Mr Floyd being arrested in Minneapolis and a white police officer continuing to kneel on his neck even after he pleaded he could not breathe and fell unconscious. Live updates from around the US 'Unacceptable' attacks on reporters at Floyd protests How are African-Americans treated by the law? More than 75 cities have seen protests, with streets only days ago deserted because of coronavirus full of demonstrators marching shoulder to shoulder. Some US officials have warned of protest-connected virus outbreaks. The Floyd case has reignited deep-seated anger over police killings of black Americans and racism. It follows the high-profile cases of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Eric Garner in New York and others that have driven the Black Lives Matter movement. For many, the outrage also reflects years of frustration over socio-economic inequality and discrimination,not least in Minneapolis itself, where George Floyd died. About 16,000 troops from the National Guard - the US reserve military force for domestic emergencies - have been deployed to deal with the unrest across 24 states and Washington, DC, where crowds once again gathered near the White House on Sunday night. Demonstrators lit fire to buildings there, including a historic church known as the church of the presidents, and threw stones at riot officers. Police used tear gas in response. In Louisville, Kentucky, a man was shot dead in a confrontation between protesters, police and the National Guard after midnight. Shots were fired at police officers and guard troops as they moved to disperse a crowd in a car park and they ""returned fire"", leaving one man dead, Louisville Metro Police said. As on Friday and Saturday, demonstrations that had been peaceful during the day again descended into violence as night fell. Police vehicles were vandalised and set alight in several cities, while riot officers continued to respond with tear gas and flash grenades. Stores were looted in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania At least 4,400 people have been arrested in several days of protests, according to the Associated Press news agency, for offences including blocking motorways, looting and breaking curfew. On Monday, President Trump told state governors  in a videoconference that they looked ""weak"",according to leaked audio obtained by CBS,external. ""You have to dominate, if you don't dominate you're wasting your time,"" the president reportedly said. Jordan 'pained and angry' after Floyd death The man whose death convulsed the US In pictures: Washington DC hit by violent protests A 19:00 curfew has now been imposed in Washington DC for Monday and Tuesday nights. Protesters reportedly threw bottles at riot officers in Boston before torching a police cruiser In Minneapolis, a lorry driver was arrested after reportedly breaching a road barrier before speeding towards a crowd of protesters marching along a major motorway. The driver was taken to hospital with minor injuries and later to the county jail. There were no immediate reports of other casualties. Minnesota's Governor Tim Walz said the motive of the driver was unclear, adding: ""To not have tragedy and many deaths is simply an amazing thing."" This video can not be played A tanker has been driven at protesters in Minneapolis Many videos shared on social media appeared to show riot police responding disproportionately to demonstrators. In Atlanta, Georgia, two officers were sacked on Sunday for using excessive force - including using a taser on two young college students.

For three years, Donald Trump presided over a nation of relative peace and prosperity. The crises he faced were largely of his own making, and he confronted them by rallying his supporters and condemning his opponents. Now Trump faces a situation ill-suited to a playbook of division. The US economy has been hobbled by a deadly pandemic. George Floyd's death at the hands of a Minneapolis police officer has spread racial unrest across the nation. The public is uncertain and afraid - and increasingly angry. These are circumstances that would test the abilities of even the most skilful leaders. This president, however, risks becoming lost at sea. His public calls for unity and healing have been undermined by a penchant for Twitter name-calling and bellicosity. Message discipline, a valuable attribute at this moment, is not his forte. There may be no easy way to guide the nation through its current peril. Barack Obama's measured coolness did nothing to stop the fires of Ferguson any more than Richard Nixon's law-and-order edicts quelled Vietnam-era unrest. The economic and social devastation of the pandemic has created a political landscape of dry brush ignited by the lightning strike of Floyd's death. The president may not be able to contain the wildfire, even if he isn't feeding the flames. Terrence Floyd, George's younger brother, told ABC News,externalhe condemned the violent protests, saying his brother stood for peace. ""I'm outraged too,"" he said. ""Sometimes I get angry... I want to go crazy. My brother wasn't about that. My brother was about peace. You'll hear a lot of people saying: 'He was a gentle giant.' Why do some protests turn violent? The last 30 minutes of George Floyd's life ""I just had to come down here to speak to people, and let people know, just channel your anger elsewhere. Don't tear up your town."" This video can not be played ""It's like we're re-living the same movie"": How black British people feel about George Floyd's death On the evening of 25 May, police were called to a grocery store where George Floyd had allegedly paid for cigarettes with a counterfeit $20 note. They found him in his car outside and tried to put him in a police vehicle, but Mr Floyd dropped to the ground, telling officers he was claustrophobic. According to police, he physically resisted and was handcuffed. Video of the incident does not clearly show what happened at that point. Bystander footage shows three police officers kneeling on the unarmed Mr Floyd, with officer Derek Chauvin's knee on his neck. Mr Floyd can be heard saying ""please, I can't breathe"" several times and ""don't kill me"" but Mr Chauvin does not remove his knee despite pleas from bystanders. A memorial to George Floyd near the spot where he died while in police custody in Minneapolis According to a preliminary autopsy, the police officer had his knee on Mr Floyd's neck for eight minutes and 46 seconds - almost three minutes of which was after Mr Floyd became non-responsive. Nearly two minutes before Mr Chauvin removed his knee the other officers checked Mr Floyd's right wrist for a pulse and were unable to find one. He was taken to hospital and pronounced dead around an hour later. Mr Chauvin, 44, has been charged with murder.

Schools back but mixed picture on pupil turn-out,"Parents bringing their children back to school on Monday in Norfolk Head teachers are reporting ""highly variable"" levels of attendance, ranging from 40% to 70%, as primary schools in England bring back more pupils. Geoff Barton, leader of the ASCL heads' union, says the return has been ""very mixed"" - with some schools not yet open and some children staying away. Children in Reception, Years 1 and 6 are the first groups able to return. It comes as lockdown measures are eased in England, including groups of six people being allowed to meet outside. Schools have remained open throughout the coronavirus restrictions for the children of key workers and vulnerable children - but from Monday more than two million more pupils have been invited back. Latest government figures show 39,045 people with the virus have died in the UK, across all settings. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said there had been a day-on-day increase of 111 deaths and 1,570 new positive tests. An additional 445 deaths have been added to the overall death toll in the past day. The increase is explained by the retrospective inclusion of some patients whose tests were carried out by commercial partners, rather than the NHS or Public Health England. The first wave of primary school pupils has returned to school The head teachers' leader says the ""first impression"" has been of a very varied local picture - with not all schools either open or bringing back pupils as outlined in the government's plans. Some local authorities have not yet started to bring back more pupils, some schools have limited space, some are still training and not all staff are available, he said. ""Caution is the watchword, and everybody is approaching this task with the safety of pupils and staff as their absolute priority,"" said Mr Barton. Live: England goes back to school In pictures: the first day back at school Which children will be going back to school? How could all children fit in school with 15 pupils per classroom? A survey from the National Foundation for Educational Research suggested almost 50% of children would be kept at home by parents. Mr Barton's early feedback suggests ranges of between 30% and 60% of pupils not attending school. Social distancing markers have been added to school life But he said more key workers' children seemed to be coming in and he expected the overall numbers to increase as ""more parents become confident"". The biggest teachers' union, the National Education Union, has warned it was not yet safe to open schools - and the union's co-leader, Kevin Courtney, said delaying the wider opening of schools would ""make our communities safer"". Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said children needed to catch up with missed lessons and at school they ""will be with their teachers and friends again"". ""I'm excited to see my friends and see everyone but not excited for the work,"" says 11-year-old Sean, returning to school in Mortlake, West London. BBC News education reporter Judith Burns describes the return to school: ""You look like you've grown,"" says teacher Catherine Hughes to a reception pupil who hasn't been in school since March. Pupils have to learn a new way of behaving at school ""Are you excited to be back?"" Helen Frostick head of St Mary Magdalen's Catholic primary school in Mortlake, West London asks another. About half of those who could have returned have taken up their places, alongside 15 children of key workers who have continued to come into school throughout the lockdown. The classrooms have been completely reorganised, with desks in rows, facing forwards, instead of pushed together into big tables. Parents say goodbye for the first Monday morning back in 10 weeks There's lots of hand washing and the windows are open to let in fresh air. The school has split each class into two separate bubbles with one half in on Monday and Tuesday and the other on Thursday and Friday, which allows for a deep clean on Wednesdays. In the Reception class each table is separate, with its own tray of equipment so that the children don't need to get out of their seats so much, says teaching assistant, Clare Gordon. ""It really is best for the family,"" says mum Sophia as she brings her two sons to school. She has managed to do some home schooling with the boys over the past few weeks but it hasn't always been easy. A socially distanced first morning back in school ""I was 10% worried but 90% thinking it was the right thing to do,"" says Julia, who has just dropped off her son. ""The main thing is for normality and for his mental health. He needs the interaction with his friends. He's been begging to come back,"" she says. A survey from the National Foundation for Educational Research suggested approaching half of families would keep their children at home. It expected that: 46% of parents will keep children at home 50% of parents in schools in disadvantaged areas will keep children at home 25% of teachers are likely to be absent because of health issues for themselves or their families. This video can not be played Can children catch and spread coronavirus? Jane Reid, a parent from York, said it was still not safe for her son to go back to school, saying: ""It's a definite no from me. ""Plus, the contradictory information is infuriating. I can take him to school, but can't get his hair cut."" ""How can I send them to school now, knowing it will be impossible for teachers to implement social distancing rules properly?"" asked Valerie Brooker from Haslemere in Surrey. Pupils have returned to find a different kind of classroom In other developments in England: Those shielding since lockdown began 10 weeks agowill be allowed outdoorswith a family member or to meet one other friend Groups of up to six people from different householdscan meet in parks and private gardens,as long as they remain two metres apart People can exercise outsidewith up to five othersfrom different households Domestic competitive sportwill be allowed behind closed doors Outdoor marketsand car showrooms can reopen, provided they have Covid-related measures in place People are banned from staying at another address overnight unless it is for a specified reason, such as work or attending a funeral. But they can leave their homes without needing a ""reasonable excuse"" The Association of Directors of Public Health, which represents council health figures,warned in the Guardian,externalthat restrictions were being relaxed too quickly as ""the public is not keeping to social distancing as it was"". In Wales, people from two different households can meet each other outdoors. Groups of four to six people who are not in the same household can meet outdoors in Northern Ireland. And in Scotland members of two different households are already allowed to meet outdoors.

For some parents the decision has been taken out of their hands. Lancashire County Council is among those saying it is not yet safe to open schools. A mother in Lancashire, who wanted to remain anonymous, has described this as a relief as she did not want her child to go back, although her husband did. This video can not be played A Suffolk school has built a teepee to allow social distancing The way that schools are bringing back pupils has many local variations - spread out over the next couple of weeks and with many schools making their own arrangements over which year groups return and for how many days a week. The day looked very different for those pupils who did return - with staggered drop-off times and children staying in small groups of no more than 15 pupils. Ministers say opening schools will help with childcare for parents returning to work - and to help children catch up with missed lessons. Protesters outside the Department for Education warned that opening schools was not safe From 15 June secondary pupils will start to return, in Years 10 and 12 - and there are plans for all primary years to go back for the last month of term. Teachers' unions unconvinced by school safety plans 'Virus could be here for a year', so schools must reopen Nurseries and early years' providers are also opening, and a survey of 4,500 parents with young children, carried out by the Early Years Alliance, indicated a divided picture on take-up. 65% of nurseries and childcare settings open from 1 June 45% of parents planning to take up places The biggest reason for parents not sending in their children was concern about safety. Chief executive Neil Leitch warned the row over the prime minister's adviserDominic Cummings travelling during lockdownthreatened to undermine parents' trust on safety measures. A school in Tamworth with pupils back in class The concern was echoed by the Royal Society of Arts which published a survey of more than 2,000 adults in the UK showing 49% think the government is too caught up in the ""Dominic Cummings affair"" to be making the right decisions about schools. ""Despite the narrative from the government, the level of confidence for a return to schools remains low,"" said Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers. Tulip Siddiq, Labour's shadow minister for children and early years, said the lower demand for childcare places would put nurseries under ""extraordinary financial pressure"" and  ""millions of childcare places could be lost in this crisis"".

Coronavirus in England: Schools reopen,"Some primary schools in England have reopened after 10 weeks but a number of schools have stayed shut Children in Reception, Years 1 and 6 are able to return but attendance is not compulsory A survey says half of parents are still wary about coronavirus and are not sending their children in Schools have staggered drop-off and pick up times and children will stay in small groups of no more than 15 pupils Updates on Monday 1 June Rob England and David Cosgrove Rob EnglandBBC News That's all from our live updates on the day England's primary schools started to reopen. We'll be back tomorrow morning from 07:30 BST with more coronavirus news and updates from around the country. Thanks for joining us, and have a good evening. Rob EnglandBBC News Darren Styne said he and his partner changed their minds and decided to not send their son back to school due to concerns about social distancing guidelines. ""Part
of the problem, for me, was that he couldn't play with the other children, and
would be expected to sit by himself, two metres apart from another child,"" Mr Styne, from Derbyshire, said. ""You canât tell a kid not to go play with their friends."" Mr Styne said he considered the school's advice to be ""spot on"", but a letter saying that children breaking social distancing measures repeatedly could be excluded made him ""uncomfortable"". ""We would feel better if we had inclusive groups of four or five kids that they could interact with. I feel like it will be [like that] after the summer holidays, so in September we will review sending him back to school."" David PittamBBC News Online Outside Chellaston Infant School earlier, Gurpreet Dhinsa told me he had no concerns about his children Jeevan, 6, and Nirvar, 5, returning. ""I wasn't at all worried about them going back,"" he said. ""No-one in the family is vulnerable. ""The kids were getting sick and tired of the same surroundings. ""The government has scientific backing for it, we need to start thinking about a route to some normality otherwise we'll be stuck in a rut for months or years.""  Rob EnglandBBC News Throughout the day we've been looking at the return of some primary school pupils to schools across England. But what about the students who haven't really left school? Key worker Sam, from Amesbury, Wiltshire, whose daughters are five and eight, says they have been going into school as normal since they closed to most. He and his wife are both key workers - Sam is a plumbing and heating engineer, and his wife is a dispenser in a pharmacy. ""Key workers haven't had the choice about sending children to school as we've had to go to work,"" he said. ""Whilst non key worker parents have a choice, there will always be some who won't send them. ""But with that attitude they won't ever send them back as there are always dangers."" Sam continued: ""Our school has been amazing and we've had no concerns around safety. The children play in their bubbles whilst maintaining social distancing. ""Our five-year-old has no problem with social distancing and finds it second nature just like the teachers now."" Rob EnglandBBC News Elizabeth Kundu, who lives near Selby in North Yorkshire, says she won't be sending her daughter, who is in Year 1, back to school this week. ""I personally donât think itâs safe,"" she said. Her main concern is the national infection rate, which she says is not low enough to make her feel comfortable with the move. ""Some people have to send their kids back to school and they are doing so with a lot of anxiety,"" Ms Kundu said. ""I am not going to send them back until I can see a testing and tracing system in place that is working. ""Once testing doesnât take so long and we know a true regional picture, then I will be happy to send them back."" David PittamBBC News Online After a long day of mixed emotions, Chellaston Junior School pupils left for the day. Jude Smith, 42, mother of Frankie, in Year 6, and Tallulah, in Year 4, said: ""I was in two minds about
sending them back, I was worried about the social distancing. ""But the school has been brilliant, they've addressed
all my concerns."" Frankie added: ""It was really exciting going back. I was a bit nervous at first but happy now I'm here."" Parent bringing their children back to school on Monday in Norfolk Head teachers are reporting ""highly variable"" levels of attendance, ranging from 40% to 70%,as primary schools in England bring back more pupils.

Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said children needed to catch up with missed lessons and at school they ""will be with their teachers and friends again"". Rob EnglandBBC News Lynn
Sanders, a retired teacher from Guildford who now works as a supply teacher, says she has declined returning to work for health reasons. ""The reality of the job is that it is a very difficult thing
to social distance for small children,"" she said. ""I have a partner who is diabetic and coming up for 70, so he is high risk. I had to make the decision whether I was available for work, and I have had to say no for health reasons."" Ms Sanders added she thought ""very few schools"" would want supply teachers at this time, with limited pupil numbers and teachers unlikely to be needing cover to go on courses. ""People who depend on supply teaching for an income will fall through the cracks,"" she said. At St Mary Magdalen's Catholic Primary School in West London, head teacher Helen Frostick has spent the last few weeks redesigning classrooms, reconfiguring timetables and totally rethinking school policy on everything from PE to uniform. For staff and students, it's the first time many of them have seen each other since March. The World at OneBBC Radio 4 England's Children's Commissioner has urged the government to support a ""summer programme"" to help older pupils catch up on missed lessons. ""We've been talking about young children going back to school today but of course most children, especially older children, will have to wait an awful lot longer - up to six months,"" Anne Longfield told the BBC's World at One. She added any programme would need to take place ""in school buildings"" but could potentially be run by staff such as social workers, instead of just teachers. Children in Reception, Years 1 and 6 have been the first groupsable to return to schools across Englandfrom today. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Primary schools will face challenges in accommodating more pupils as they reopen, a trade union boss has said. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), said the early signs were that the picture on the wider opening of primary schools across England was ""very mixed"". He added that the expected level of pupil attendance at primary schools was ""highly variable"", with head teachers reporting that the attendance ranges between 40% and 70% of the eligible pupils. Children inReception, Years 1 and 6 are able to return, with many having been out of school for 10 weeks. Mr Barton said: ""School leaders are also reporting that they are seeing an increase in the number of key worker children who are attending across all year groups. ""Schools have remained open to vulnerable and key worker children throughout the lockdown period, and as the lockdown eases, it is likely this will lead to greater demand for places."" He added: ""This will be extremely challenging for primary schools to accommodate, particularly small primary schools, in addition to bringing in the eligible year groups."" David PittamBBC News Online The 108 Year 6 pupils who returned to Chellaston Junior School today were taught across 14 classrooms. This class had 10 pupils and two unused desks - 21 members of the year group did not return today. Reopening schoolshave been advisedto reduce class sizes to 15 pupils or fewer, with children kept 2m (6ft 6in) apart wherever possible. Staggered break times, increased hand washing and less sharing of equipment have also been recommended. Daniel WainwrightBBC England Data Unit There are more than 680,000 families across England where all the children in the household are in one or more of the year groups eligible to return to school from today. According to theOffice for National Statistics,external, these families include more than one million working adults. Families have been trying to balance homeschooling and work commitments since schools closed to most pupils on 20 March. However, some parents may still choose to keep their children at home. A survey of 1,200 school leaders by the National Foundation for Educational Research suggests as many as46% of parentsmay not be willing to send their children back to class. Rob EnglandBBC News Danielle Nott, from Tyne and Wear, said she's decided to keep her son at home because it would be ""unfair"" on her daughter, who cannot go back because of capacity issues. Ms Nott's son is in nursery and her daughter is in Year 1. ""There is no sound play, carpet time or book corner for him
even if he did go,"" she said. ""I would have to drag my daughter to school to drop him off
and then take her home."" ""She is really upset; I am really struggling to get her to do her school work,"" Ms Nott added. She said her children's school were bringing students back ""in order of age"" with the youngest returning first. ""All the younger ones are just playing; at least if my daughter went back, she would be learning,"" she said. ""There is still a lot of learning that we canât do at home."" A cabinet minister has insisted the lockdown is being eased in a ""very cautious"" way as thousands of children in England began returning to school despite concerns from public health officials, unions and parents. Business Secretary Alok Sharma said he understands parents' concerns over sending their children back to class. Mr Sharma told the BBC: ""This is not a dash. These are very cautious steps that we are taking. They are phased."" He said that he ""completely"" understood that ""every parent wants to keep their child safe"", but insisted the government had taken steps to ensure schools are safe to return to as classes re-opened to children in Reception, Year 1 and Year 6 in England. Pupils at St John's Primary in Penistone, Sheffield, say they are pleased to be back at school after coronavirus lockdown restrictions were eased. St John's pupil Reuben Dachtler, 11, said he was ""excited"" to get back to school after 10 weeks away, while Lucy Raynor, 11, said she had missed her lessons and her teachers: This video can not be played Primary pupils are back in some schools across England following the lockdown, but there's a mixed picture in how they're reopening, with schools in some areas staying shut. Schools have remained open throughout the coronavirus restrictions for the children of key workers and vulnerable children - but from today many more pupils are able to return. The National Association of Headteachers has tweeted that there needs to be greater ""local flexibility"" in schools reopening, but added that it will advise the government that it is unwise and impractical to admit pupils in greater numbers, if current lockdown measures continue.

Head teacher Alex Smythe said the idea all children could be back in school by the end of the term was ""crazy"". ""We don't have the capacity, in terms of space or teachers,"" he said.  Rob EnglandBBC News Dee Aldrich, from Harlow in Essex, says her twin girls have had ""an amazing time"" at their Reception class today. She said out of the twins' 15 classmates, only three others returned. Ms Aldrich said: ""The way the staff are structuring returning to school has
been great. Theyâve sent video plans of what is going to
be happening."" Teachers have also been socially distancing the children, and were told to use separate equipment to complete activities. Ms Aldrich said: ""When they go in, they have designated toys and playdough with their names on it â they have to take their own water in. ""The kids have been really good at social distancing, theyâve actually done it. ""Theyâve washed their hands continually, they have one desk each...at the moment itâs working. ""The key worker children have been kept separately - but they have been allowed to wave at their friends through the window.â Kirstie BrewerBBC News Marsha's WhatsApp group went pinging into overdrive as soon as it was announced that primary schools and nurseries would reopen for some children. There was outrage, relief, excitement, anxiety. Everyone seemed to have an opinion. Marsha wrote that she'd be happy to send her son back to school. Then immediately another mum shared a news item about a teacher who'd tested positive for coronavirus. ""This is why I will be keeping Rosie safe at home with me - I'm not putting her life at risk,"" she wrote. A few other parents then sent thumbs-up and shocked-face emojis to show their approval of Rosie's mum's message. ""It felt very passive-aggressive,"" says Marsha, who said she didn't want her real name to be published because she couldn't face ""more drama"".

""Schools have remained open to vulnerable and key worker children throughout the lockdown period, and as the lockdown eases, it is likely this will lead to greater demand for places."" He added: ""This will be extremely challenging for primary schools to accommodate, particularly small primary schools, in addition to bringing in the eligible year groups."" David PittamBBC News Online The 108 Year 6 pupils who returned to Chellaston Junior School today were taught across 14 classrooms. This class had 10 pupils and two unused desks - 21 members of the year group did not return today. Reopening schoolshave been advisedto reduce class sizes to 15 pupils or fewer, with children kept 2m (6ft 6in) apart wherever possible. Staggered break times, increased hand washing and less sharing of equipment have also been recommended. Daniel WainwrightBBC England Data Unit There are more than 680,000 families across England where all the children in the household are in one or more of the year groups eligible to return to school from today. According to theOffice for National Statistics,external, these families include more than one million working adults. Families have been trying to balance homeschooling and work commitments since schools closed to most pupils on 20 March. However, some parents may still choose to keep their children at home. A survey of 1,200 school leaders by the National Foundation for Educational Research suggests as many as46% of parentsmay not be willing to send their children back to class. Rob EnglandBBC News Danielle Nott, from Tyne and Wear, said she's decided to keep her son at home because it would be ""unfair"" on her daughter, who cannot go back because of capacity issues. Ms Nott's son is in nursery and her daughter is in Year 1. ""There is no sound play, carpet time or book corner for him
even if he did go,"" she said. ""I would have to drag my daughter to school to drop him off
and then take her home."" ""She is really upset; I am really struggling to get her to do her school work,"" Ms Nott added. She said her children's school were bringing students back ""in order of age"" with the youngest returning first. ""All the younger ones are just playing; at least if my daughter went back, she would be learning,"" she said. ""There is still a lot of learning that we canât do at home."" A cabinet minister has insisted the lockdown is being eased in a ""very cautious"" way as thousands of children in England began returning to school despite concerns from public health officials, unions and parents. Business Secretary Alok Sharma said he understands parents' concerns over sending their children back to class. Mr Sharma told the BBC: ""This is not a dash. These are very cautious steps that we are taking. They are phased."" He said that he ""completely"" understood that ""every parent wants to keep their child safe"", but insisted the government had taken steps to ensure schools are safe to return to as classes re-opened to children in Reception, Year 1 and Year 6 in England. Pupils at St John's Primary in Penistone, Sheffield, say they are pleased to be back at school after coronavirus lockdown restrictions were eased. St John's pupil Reuben Dachtler, 11, said he was ""excited"" to get back to school after 10 weeks away, while Lucy Raynor, 11, said she had missed her lessons and her teachers: This video can not be played Primary pupils are back in some schools across England following the lockdown, but there's a mixed picture in how they're reopening, with schools in some areas staying shut. Schools have remained open throughout the coronavirus restrictions for the children of key workers and vulnerable children - but from today many more pupils are able to return. The National Association of Headteachers has tweeted that there needs to be greater ""local flexibility"" in schools reopening, but added that it will advise the government that it is unwise and impractical to admit pupils in greater numbers, if current lockdown measures continue.

Head teacher Alex Smythe said the idea all children could be back in school by the end of the term was ""crazy"". ""We don't have the capacity, in terms of space or teachers,"" he said.  Rob EnglandBBC News Dee Aldrich, from Harlow in Essex, says her twin girls have had ""an amazing time"" at their Reception class today. She said out of the twins' 15 classmates, only three others returned. Ms Aldrich said: ""The way the staff are structuring returning to school has
been great. Theyâve sent video plans of what is going to
be happening."" Teachers have also been socially distancing the children, and were told to use separate equipment to complete activities. Ms Aldrich said: ""When they go in, they have designated toys and playdough with their names on it â they have to take their own water in. ""The kids have been really good at social distancing, theyâve actually done it. ""Theyâve washed their hands continually, they have one desk each...at the moment itâs working. ""The key worker children have been kept separately - but they have been allowed to wave at their friends through the window.â Kirstie BrewerBBC News Marsha's WhatsApp group went pinging into overdrive as soon as it was announced that primary schools and nurseries would reopen for some children. There was outrage, relief, excitement, anxiety. Everyone seemed to have an opinion. Marsha wrote that she'd be happy to send her son back to school. Then immediately another mum shared a news item about a teacher who'd tested positive for coronavirus. ""This is why I will be keeping Rosie safe at home with me - I'm not putting her life at risk,"" she wrote. A few other parents then sent thumbs-up and shocked-face emojis to show their approval of Rosie's mum's message. ""It felt very passive-aggressive,"" says Marsha, who said she didn't want her real name to be published because she couldn't face ""more drama"". I spoke to mothers feeling judged or shamed for their decision to send children back to school -or to keep them at home. Â© 2025 BBC.

Zodiakos wins as horse racing returnsZodiakos creates history with victory at Newcastle racecourse as elite sport returns to England after coronavirus.BBC Sport,"Social distancing was observed in the paddock by jockeys and trainers at Newcastle The sun shone in Newcastle on Monday but as Zodiakos passed the post a neck ahead of stablemate Al Ozzdi to win a thrilling opening race shortly after 13:00 BST, there was nothing but an eerie silence. After 76 days without horse racing in Britain, this was how it returned - with a behind-closed-doors victory for a 22-1 chance, ridden by Jimmy Sullivan and trained by Roger Fell, in the Welcome Back British Racing Handicap. Those involved with the sport were glad to be back, although there was sadness too: December Second - trained by Philip Kirby - died after suffering a fall in the 17:05 race. The news cast a shadow over a significant day. Preparations for the all-weather meeting at Gosforth Park had been meticulous as elite sport in England made its return after the coronavirus lockdown. The car park at the track was empty, with racegoers, owners, bookmakers and most of the media kept behind a ring of temporary wire fencing encircling the racecourse. Each of the 10 races were limited to 12 runners and apart from jockeys, the course was only open to a few people: trainers' representatives, stable staff, officials and a small number of media. Those allowed in had to complete a three-stage screening process, including medical checks before departure and on arrival. This video can not be played British horse racing returns but how will it look? BBC Sport's Katie Gornall is at Newcastle's Gosforth Park Masks were also required by jockeys and stalls handlers, with the heat adding to feelings of unfamiliarity and discomfort. ""Riding in the mask, it is very warm and after pulling up I pulled it down a little just to get a few breaths in,"" said Sullivan after his win. ""It wasn't too bad, though. It's manageable and it's the sort of thing that, in a week, you won't even notice."" Social distancing measures were strictly enforced at the course, with markers on the floor, two-metre warnings on the walls and a one-way system in place. Horse racing's return: Five viewpoints on the sport's comeback Patience and unity key to easing restrictions, says Sport Wales boss With no bars and restaurants open, it was packed lunches in paper bags for those who needed to be fed. In the paddock, the horses still made their way around the parade ring, but jockeys had to follow a set route in and markings showed where they and the trainers' representatives could stand. Riders also had to use a different weighing room to normal, because of its size, and at the end of the race, only the winner returned to the paddock while all the others had to unsaddle in a dedicated area near the racecourse stables. With no on-course bookies and high street shops closed until 15 June, online and telephone betting were the options open for those who wanted to put their money on the day's events. One bookmaker said turnover had been 50% higher than anticipated. Jockeys wearing masks kept their distance from each other With another meeting at Gosforth Park on Tuesday, plus a card at Kempton as racing builds up to Saturday's 2,000 Guineas at Newmarket, the pressure was on Newcastle to deliver. ""It is vital we got this right,"" said Martin Cruddace, chief executive of racecourse owner Arena Racing Company. ""We are trailblazers for the sport and there is an incredible pressure, but it is a privilege as well and we are delighted it falls on us. ""It has been an amazing effort by everyone."" The course's efforts earned praise from the British Horseracing Authority's chief regulatory officer Brant Dunshea. ""We have had a few teething problems with some IT issues which were ironed out,"" he said. ""But the racecourse has done a fantastic job in how it has laid out the course. It is a very well-secured site and we are very impressed with the facilities. ""It is important we learn from each day. In the current climate, we can't be too careful."" There was, though, pause to reflect on the death of December Second. The BHA, expressing its sadness, said: ""Equine welfare has been an important consideration in our planning to return - for example, there have been limits placed on field sizes as part of the sport's resumption of racing strategy. ""Racehorses have been able to continue to train and exercise during the lockdown and have been able to maintain their normal level of fitness, looked after by dedicated staff. ""Their safety has been an important consideration in our planning for return but it is impossible to remove risk altogether."" What impact has coronavirus had on racing? Check out the latest horse racing results World champion Judd Trump played in the first snooker match on the sport's return As racing resumed at a near-deserted venue, there was the same eerie feeling in Milton Keynes as snooker returned behind closed doors. The Championship League was the first sports event in the UK to be shown on free-to-air TV since the easing of restrictions - with an on-site hotel at the Marshall Arena allowing players to isolate before play. World champion Judd Trump had to isolate for 18 hours after being given a Covid-19 test at 16:00 BST on Sunday. With Trump - along with the tournament's seven other players and 35 staff working at the venue - returning a negative result, play began on Monday. Trump, who progressed as winner of his group, had to wear a face mask and adhere to social distancing guidelines - with players sitting two metres apart and barred from sharing equipment, such as rests and cue extensions. The event was broadcast on ITV4, with presenter Jill Douglas and the pundits all working from home. World number one Trump - and the rest of the snooker circuit - is getting used to a rejigged calendar; the season would normally end in May, at the conclusion of the World Championship, which is now set to start on 31 July. Trump told BBC Sport: ""In an ideal scenario, I would be on holiday somewhere now with another world crown. But for me, the last month was starting to get quite difficult, being stuck inside all the time. ""Nothing is ideal and it is changing week on week - but just to be able to get to some kind of normality in playing snooker again is a nice relief.

Coronavirus in England: Schools reopenBringing you the latest news from across England as schools begin to reopen.,"Some primary schools in England have reopened after 10 weeks but a number of schools have stayed shut Children in Reception, Years 1 and 6 are able to return but attendance is not compulsory A survey says half of parents are still wary about coronavirus and are not sending their children in Schools have staggered drop-off and pick up times and children will stay in small groups of no more than 15 pupils Updates on Monday 1 June Rob England and David Cosgrove Rob EnglandBBC News That's all from our live updates on the day England's primary schools started to reopen. We'll be back tomorrow morning from 07:30 BST with more coronavirus news and updates from around the country. Thanks for joining us, and have a good evening. Rob EnglandBBC News Darren Styne said he and his partner changed their minds and decided to not send their son back to school due to concerns about social distancing guidelines. ""Part
of the problem, for me, was that he couldn't play with the other children, and
would be expected to sit by himself, two metres apart from another child,"" Mr Styne, from Derbyshire, said. ""You canât tell a kid not to go play with their friends."" Mr Styne said he considered the school's advice to be ""spot on"", but a letter saying that children breaking social distancing measures repeatedly could be excluded made him ""uncomfortable"". ""We would feel better if we had inclusive groups of four or five kids that they could interact with. I feel like it will be [like that] after the summer holidays, so in September we will review sending him back to school."" David PittamBBC News Online Outside Chellaston Infant School earlier, Gurpreet Dhinsa told me he had no concerns about his children Jeevan, 6, and Nirvar, 5, returning. ""I wasn't at all worried about them going back,"" he said. ""No-one in the family is vulnerable. ""The kids were getting sick and tired of the same surroundings. ""The government has scientific backing for it, we need to start thinking about a route to some normality otherwise we'll be stuck in a rut for months or years.""  Rob EnglandBBC News Throughout the day we've been looking at the return of some primary school pupils to schools across England. But what about the students who haven't really left school? Key worker Sam, from Amesbury, Wiltshire, whose daughters are five and eight, says they have been going into school as normal since they closed to most. He and his wife are both key workers - Sam is a plumbing and heating engineer, and his wife is a dispenser in a pharmacy. ""Key workers haven't had the choice about sending children to school as we've had to go to work,"" he said. ""Whilst non key worker parents have a choice, there will always be some who won't send them. ""But with that attitude they won't ever send them back as there are always dangers."" Sam continued: ""Our school has been amazing and we've had no concerns around safety. The children play in their bubbles whilst maintaining social distancing. ""Our five-year-old has no problem with social distancing and finds it second nature just like the teachers now."" Rob EnglandBBC News Elizabeth Kundu, who lives near Selby in North Yorkshire, says she won't be sending her daughter, who is in Year 1, back to school this week. ""I personally donât think itâs safe,"" she said. Her main concern is the national infection rate, which she says is not low enough to make her feel comfortable with the move. ""Some people have to send their kids back to school and they are doing so with a lot of anxiety,"" Ms Kundu said. ""I am not going to send them back until I can see a testing and tracing system in place that is working. ""Once testing doesnât take so long and we know a true regional picture, then I will be happy to send them back."" David PittamBBC News Online After a long day of mixed emotions, Chellaston Junior School pupils left for the day. Jude Smith, 42, mother of Frankie, in Year 6, and Tallulah, in Year 4, said: ""I was in two minds about
sending them back, I was worried about the social distancing. ""But the school has been brilliant, they've addressed
all my concerns."" Frankie added: ""It was really exciting going back. I was a bit nervous at first but happy now I'm here."" Parent bringing their children back to school on Monday in Norfolk Head teachers are reporting ""highly variable"" levels of attendance, ranging from 40% to 70%,as primary schools in England bring back more pupils. Children in Reception, Years 1 and 6 are the first groups able to return. Geoff Barton, leader of the ASCL heads' union, says the return has been ""very mixed"" - with some schools not yet open and some children staying away. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said children needed to catch up with missed lessons and at school they ""will be with their teachers and friends again"". Rob EnglandBBC News Lynn
Sanders, a retired teacher from Guildford who now works as a supply teacher, says she has declined returning to work for health reasons. ""The reality of the job is that it is a very difficult thing
to social distance for small children,"" she said. ""I have a partner who is diabetic and coming up for 70, so he is high risk. I had to make the decision whether I was available for work, and I have had to say no for health reasons."" Ms Sanders added she thought ""very few schools"" would want supply teachers at this time, with limited pupil numbers and teachers unlikely to be needing cover to go on courses. ""People who depend on supply teaching for an income will fall through the cracks,"" she said. At St Mary Magdalen's Catholic Primary School in West London, head teacher Helen Frostick has spent the last few weeks redesigning classrooms, reconfiguring timetables and totally rethinking school policy on everything from PE to uniform. For staff and students, it's the first time many of them have seen each other since March. The World at OneBBC Radio 4 England's Children's Commissioner has urged the government to support a ""summer programme"" to help older pupils catch up on missed lessons. ""We've been talking about young children going back to school today but of course most children, especially older children, will have to wait an awful lot longer - up to six months,"" Anne Longfield told the BBC's World at One. She added any programme would need to take place ""in school buildings"" but could potentially be run by staff such as social workers, instead of just teachers. Children in Reception, Years 1 and 6 have been the first groupsable to return to schools across Englandfrom today. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Primary schools will face challenges in accommodating more pupils as they reopen, a trade union boss has said. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), said the early signs were that the picture on the wider opening of primary schools across England was ""very mixed"". He added that the expected level of pupil attendance at primary schools was ""highly variable"", with head teachers reporting that the attendance ranges between 40% and 70% of the eligible pupils. Children inReception, Years 1 and 6 are able to return, with many having been out of school for 10 weeks. Mr Barton said: ""School leaders are also reporting that they are seeing an increase in the number of key worker children who are attending across all year groups. ""Schools have remained open to vulnerable and key worker children throughout the lockdown period, and as the lockdown eases, it is likely this will lead to greater demand for places."" He added: ""This will be extremely challenging for primary schools to accommodate, particularly small primary schools, in addition to bringing in the eligible year groups."" David PittamBBC News Online The 108 Year 6 pupils who returned to Chellaston Junior School today were taught across 14 classrooms. This class had 10 pupils and two unused desks - 21 members of the year group did not return today. Reopening schoolshave been advisedto reduce class sizes to 15 pupils or fewer, with children kept 2m (6ft 6in) apart wherever possible. Staggered break times, increased hand washing and less sharing of equipment have also been recommended. Daniel WainwrightBBC England Data Unit There are more than 680,000 families across England where all the children in the household are in one or more of the year groups eligible to return to school from today. According to theOffice for National Statistics,external, these families include more than one million working adults. Families have been trying to balance homeschooling and work commitments since schools closed to most pupils on 20 March. However, some parents may still choose to keep their children at home. A survey of 1,200 school leaders by the National Foundation for Educational Research suggests as many as46% of parentsmay not be willing to send their children back to class. Rob EnglandBBC News Danielle Nott, from Tyne and Wear, said she's decided to keep her son at home because it would be ""unfair"" on her daughter, who cannot go back because of capacity issues. Ms Nott's son is in nursery and her daughter is in Year 1. ""There is no sound play, carpet time or book corner for him
even if he did go,"" she said. ""I would have to drag my daughter to school to drop him off
and then take her home."" ""She is really upset; I am really struggling to get her to do her school work,"" Ms Nott added. She said her children's school were bringing students back ""in order of age"" with the youngest returning first. ""All the younger ones are just playing; at least if my daughter went back, she would be learning,"" she said. ""There is still a lot of learning that we canât do at home."" A cabinet minister has insisted the lockdown is being eased in a ""very cautious"" way as thousands of children in England began returning to school despite concerns from public health officials, unions and parents. Business Secretary Alok Sharma said he understands parents' concerns over sending their children back to class. Mr Sharma told the BBC: ""This is not a dash. These are very cautious steps that we are taking. They are phased."" He said that he ""completely"" understood that ""every parent wants to keep their child safe"", but insisted the government had taken steps to ensure schools are safe to return to as classes re-opened to children in Reception, Year 1 and Year 6 in England. Pupils at St John's Primary in Penistone, Sheffield, say they are pleased to be back at school after coronavirus lockdown restrictions were eased. St John's pupil Reuben Dachtler, 11, said he was ""excited"" to get back to school after 10 weeks away, while Lucy Raynor, 11, said she had missed her lessons and her teachers: This video can not be played Primary pupils are back in some schools across England following the lockdown, but there's a mixed picture in how they're reopening, with schools in some areas staying shut. Schools have remained open throughout the coronavirus restrictions for the children of key workers and vulnerable children - but from today many more pupils are able to return. The National Association of Headteachers has tweeted that there needs to be greater ""local flexibility"" in schools reopening, but added that it will advise the government that it is unwise and impractical to admit pupils in greater numbers, if current lockdown measures continue.

David PittamBBC News Online Teaching assistant at Chellaston Junior School who said they did not feel comfortable returning to a face-to-face role with pupils are doing support work in corridors and empty classrooms. Head teacher Alex Smythe said the idea all children could be back in school by the end of the term was ""crazy"". ""We don't have the capacity, in terms of space or teachers,"" he said.  Rob EnglandBBC News Dee Aldrich, from Harlow in Essex, says her twin girls have had ""an amazing time"" at their Reception class today. She said out of the twins' 15 classmates, only three others returned. Ms Aldrich said: ""The way the staff are structuring returning to school has
been great. Theyâve sent video plans of what is going to
be happening."" Teachers have also been socially distancing the children, and were told to use separate equipment to complete activities. Ms Aldrich said: ""When they go in, they have designated toys and playdough with their names on it â they have to take their own water in. ""The kids have been really good at social distancing, theyâve actually done it. ""Theyâve washed their hands continually, they have one desk each...at the moment itâs working. ""The key worker children have been kept separately - but they have been allowed to wave at their friends through the window.â Kirstie BrewerBBC News Marsha's WhatsApp group went pinging into overdrive as soon as it was announced that primary schools and nurseries would reopen for some children. There was outrage, relief, excitement, anxiety. Everyone seemed to have an opinion. Marsha wrote that she'd be happy to send her son back to school. Then immediately another mum shared a news item about a teacher who'd tested positive for coronavirus. ""This is why I will be keeping Rosie safe at home with me - I'm not putting her life at risk,"" she wrote. A few other parents then sent thumbs-up and shocked-face emojis to show their approval of Rosie's mum's message. ""It felt very passive-aggressive,"" says Marsha, who said she didn't want her real name to be published because she couldn't face ""more drama"". I spoke to mothers feeling judged or shamed for their decision to send children back to school -or to keep them at home. Â© 2025 BBC.

"'More than two million in UK wait for cancer care'More than 23,000 cancers could have gone undiagnosed during lockdown, Cancer Research UK says.Health","There were fewer chemotherapy and radiotherapy treatments during the epidemic About 2.4 million people in the UK are waiting for cancer screening, treatment or tests, as a result of disruption to the NHS during the past 10 weeks, according to Cancer Research UK. It estimates 2.1 million have missed out on screening, while 290,000 people with suspected symptoms have not been referred for hospital tests. More than 23,000 cancers could have gone undiagnosed during lockdown. Cancer services are starting to reopen across the UK. Cancer Research UK's figures are based on data for England and estimated for the whole of the UK. During lockdown, the health service focused on the care and treatment of patients with Covid-19, while other services, such as cancer care, were scaled back. People were still encouraged to seek medical help when they needed it - but there were fewer cancer operations and many chemotherapy and radiotherapy appointments were postponed. Screening programmes that detect early signs of bowel, breast and cervical cancer were paused in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, although not officially stopped in England. And an estimated 2.1 million people who would normally have had routine screening missed out, Cancer Research UK says. Breast screening is just one of many ways of detecting cancers 'Thousands missing out on cancer diagnosis' Cancer surgery delays risk 'thousands' of deaths Cancer patients' concern over treatment suspension The charity says urgent referrals, when patients with suspected cancer symptoms are referred to hospitals by their GP, fell by up to 75% in the first four weeks of lockdown, although these figures have since improved. Patients receiving treatments for cancer also fell, with 6,000 fewer people receiving chemotherapy and 2,800 fewer receiving radiotherapy over the past 10 weeks. And there were only 60% - 12,800 fewer - of the usual number of operations to remove tumours, Cancer Research UK estimates. Chief executive Michelle Mitchell said Covid-19 has placed an ""enormous strain on cancer services"". ""The NHS has had to make very hard decisions to balance risk,"" she said. RISK AT WORK:How exposed is your job? SCHOOLS:When are children returning? EXERCISE:What are the guidelines on getting out? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? ""And there have been some difficult discussions with patients about their safety and ability to continue treatment during this time,"" she said. ""Prompt diagnosis and treatment remain crucial to give people with cancer the greatest chances of survival and prevent the pandemic taking even more lives."" To ensure no-one is put at risk from the virus now that cancer care is returning, Cancer Research UK said ""frequent testing of NHS staff and patients, including those without symptoms"" was vital. It estimates that up to 37,000 tests for the virus would need to be carried out each day for this purpose if the NHS was back running as normal. This is happening at different speeds in the four nations of the UK, with the setting up of safe Covid-free spaces in hospitals key to addressing the backlog of patients. NHS England said coronavirus ""has turned millions of lives upside down"" but cancer services were now largely ""open, ready and able to receive all patients who need care"". Anyone concerned about cancer symptoms should contact their GP. The Welsh and Scottish governments said cancer screening programmes would resume when safe, based on clinical advice. In Northern Ireland, there are plans for urgent cancer surgery and treatment to resume, along with routine screening. Macmillan Cancer Support recently warned of a potential ""ticking cancer timebomb"" due to disrupted cancer services. It said urgent action was needed to make sure cancer does not become the forgotten 'C' during the pandemic. ""We continue to urge the government to set out exactly how it will support the NHS to rapidly rebuild cancer services, including how people will be protected from infection by ensuring there is enough staff, regular testing, plentiful supplies of PPE and... social distancing,"" Sara Bainbridge, head of policy, said.

How cities might change,"The empty streets outside the New York Stock Exchange, 19 May For many of us, our homes have become our workplaces over the past few months, and a full return to the office still appears a remote prospect. Major tech companies say they are open to their staff working from home permanently. Employees are coming to realise remote working is not only possible but, in some cases, preferable. A shift to a new way of working might already be under way. Such a shift could have profound implications on our home life, and by extension on the life of our towns and cities: almost a quarter of all office space in England and Wales is in central London alone. To understand those implications, we brought together four experts on city life, all of whom were working from home. Paul Cheshire, professor of economic geography, London School of Economics: I do think we'll go back to offices but not in the same way. People are more productive when they are closer together with face-to-face contact. There's 20 years of really good persuasive research demonstrating how important that is. There are lots of things you cannot do except with other people - people are innately social animals. Les Back, professor of sociology, Goldsmiths: I do think we are at a tipping point. There's a reorientation, a recalibration of the relationship between place and time and social life that we're on the cusp of. We may see profound changes. Some things may not come back. Aude Bicquelet-Lock, deputy head of policy and research, Royal Town Planning Institute: It's true some companies have said that they could allow their workforce to work from home forever. Twitter said it. Facebook said it. The CEO of Barclays said that putting 7,000 people in the office might be a thing of the past. The experience of going to the office in Aberystwyth isn't the same as going to the office in London. The decline of office space will affect small, medium and large cities in different ways. Les Back: The hollowing-out of city life has been coming for a long time. It may be that what will happen is that some businesses won't come back to the centre of the city and think it's too risky - or there may be other economic drivers where people will just take the opportunity to ask: ""Why are we investing so much of our capital in these large office spaces?"" What's the future for the office? Your pictures of working at home I think there are possibly huge effects [of more working from home]. There's the pressure on the domestic sphere. There's the pressure on gendered relationships at home, on the blurring and overlaying of parenting and work and the pressures that would cause. Tverskaya Street in Moscow, 9 May Aude Bicquelet-Lock: I think what we will see is that local centres may see more diversification - more dining, more social activities as people may want to meet each other. Also working from home may mean getting access to workplaces in local towns for some days. Growth is to be expected in these areas. The contrary could apply to bigger cities, which of course raises the question of how the office space could be reused: there are several options, like turning offices into residential spaces, which hasn't always been done with absolute success. I also wonder whether we will need conference halls and other meeting spaces as we did in the past. Paul Cheshire: You will get more people working from home, which will mean there will be more demand for large houses. You have to have a workspace, which will push you out. You may need to move to commute maybe once a week, twice a week to your headquarters, wherever that is, for meetings. Therefore you'll accept a longer commute for cheaper space. You'll tend to move further away from the city centre. On the other hand, there will be people who have to stay in the offices, stay in the concentration, the social interaction, who will become even more strongly attracted to the city centre. But you will probably also get localised desk-sharing, specialised areas where people can go if you're a homeworker, where you can occasionally get better IT or better facilities or get away from your children. There will be an opening-up in smaller towns of hot-desking spaces. An Istanbul side street, 17 May We will need more space. What you would be doing is opening land close to stations with good access to city centres. You could build a million houses on green belt land within 45 minutes of central London because there's so much green belt land. Five ways to work well from home The fastest-growing places for people commuting to London are incredibly far away - Peterborough, York, Somerset. People are living miles out in order to get affordable land and more space. That will be accelerated. And it will be particularly accelerated unless we are willing to release land close to transport nodes that will give access to jobs. Margaret Bell, professor of transport and the environment, University of Newcastle: Our research has shown that in a study of commuting to Newcastle the 7% of trips over 50km were responsible for 60% of the carbon emissions. The further you travel, the more detrimental effect with emissions. Paul Cheshire: That's one of the ironies of the green belt: forcing people to commute further. Margaret Bell: My worry is people buying more cars and those who have cars will use them more. What we do need is incentives to use bicycles more and to get people to shift towards living closer to their work or workplaces, or arranging for people to go to work more locally. We need a bottom-up approach to understand people's needs and try and tailor the transport accordingly. Birmingham New Street station, 9 April Paul Cheshire: Housing, particularly in England, is very energy inefficient. There's quite a big carbon footprint with more time spent in the home because home heating and home insulation is far, far worse than modern commercial premises are. Margaret Bell: Some work we did in Leicester showed that if you work from home, on average you use 75% more energy than you save by not going into work. And that corresponds to a 75% increase in carbon dioxide - purely and simply because if you need heating and gas, electricity at home, that's more than what you save by not going into work by car. And so, coupled with the isolation effect, it's sensible for local businesses to open up their hot-desking offices, or even have reciprocal arrangements with companies where consultants working more out of town could reciprocate hot-desking in offices. Les Back: We are predominantly talking about people who work in finance service sectors, white-collar jobs and white-collar workers. That isn't the workforce of cities. What about hospital, school and other public sector jobs? Also, cities are important because they're places of encounter. Places of difference. That difference and the negotiations that happen across racial and cultural difference take on particular qualities in the centre of cities that are not the same in the outskirts and in the suburbs. Collister Street in New York's Tribeca neighbourhood, 21 May Aude Bicquelet-Lock: Everyone will have gone through the lockdown and will have gone through the changes and had new habits and will have strong views about what it is they want, what works for them and what doesn't. And I think one of the first things we will have to do as urban planners and policymakers is listen to what they want. But there will be financial constraints. Paul Cheshire: The other issue is people's fear: how long will it take people to recover from the experience of being worried about being in crowds, being vulnerable. I think people will recover from that if there is a vaccine, if the virus subsides. If that happens, offices will reassert themselves and all those things we liked doing in city centres will also reassert themselves. That may take quite a long time. Office life for many has changed significantly. Some will choose to continue working from home, while for others shielding, they have no choice in the matter. But when space is at a premium and bedrooms have been turned into work spaces, we want to know what life hacks you've come up with to make the most of tiny areas you are now living and working in.

Schools back but mixed picture on pupil turn-outFirst day back for some primary pupils - but heads say attendance ranges between 40% and 70%.,"Parents bringing their children back to school on Monday in Norfolk Head teachers are reporting ""highly variable"" levels of attendance, ranging from 40% to 70%, as primary schools in England bring back more pupils. Geoff Barton, leader of the ASCL heads' union, says the return has been ""very mixed"" - with some schools not yet open and some children staying away. Children in Reception, Years 1 and 6 are the first groups able to return. It comes as lockdown measures are eased in England, including groups of six people being allowed to meet outside. Schools have remained open throughout the coronavirus restrictions for the children of key workers and vulnerable children - but from Monday more than two million more pupils have been invited back. Latest government figures show 39,045 people with the virus have died in the UK, across all settings. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said there had been a day-on-day increase of 111 deaths and 1,570 new positive tests. An additional 445 deaths have been added to the overall death toll in the past day. The increase is explained by the retrospective inclusion of some patients whose tests were carried out by commercial partners, rather than the NHS or Public Health England. The first wave of primary school pupils has returned to school The head teachers' leader says the ""first impression"" has been of a very varied local picture - with not all schools either open or bringing back pupils as outlined in the government's plans. Some local authorities have not yet started to bring back more pupils, some schools have limited space, some are still training and not all staff are available, he said. ""Caution is the watchword, and everybody is approaching this task with the safety of pupils and staff as their absolute priority,"" said Mr Barton. Live: England goes back to school In pictures: the first day back at school Which children will be going back to school? How could all children fit in school with 15 pupils per classroom? A survey from the National Foundation for Educational Research suggested almost 50% of children would be kept at home by parents. Mr Barton's early feedback suggests ranges of between 30% and 60% of pupils not attending school. Social distancing markers have been added to school life But he said more key workers' children seemed to be coming in and he expected the overall numbers to increase as ""more parents become confident"". The biggest teachers' union, the National Education Union, has warned it was not yet safe to open schools - and the union's co-leader, Kevin Courtney, said delaying the wider opening of schools would ""make our communities safer"". Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said children needed to catch up with missed lessons and at school they ""will be with their teachers and friends again"". ""I'm excited to see my friends and see everyone but not excited for the work,"" says 11-year-old Sean, returning to school in Mortlake, West London. BBC News education reporter Judith Burns describes the return to school: ""You look like you've grown,"" says teacher Catherine Hughes to a reception pupil who hasn't been in school since March. Pupils have to learn a new way of behaving at school ""Are you excited to be back?"" Helen Frostick head of St Mary Magdalen's Catholic primary school in Mortlake, West London asks another. About half of those who could have returned have taken up their places, alongside 15 children of key workers who have continued to come into school throughout the lockdown. The classrooms have been completely reorganised, with desks in rows, facing forwards, instead of pushed together into big tables. Parents say goodbye for the first Monday morning back in 10 weeks There's lots of hand washing and the windows are open to let in fresh air. The school has split each class into two separate bubbles with one half in on Monday and Tuesday and the other on Thursday and Friday, which allows for a deep clean on Wednesdays. In the Reception class each table is separate, with its own tray of equipment so that the children don't need to get out of their seats so much, says teaching assistant, Clare Gordon. ""It really is best for the family,"" says mum Sophia as she brings her two sons to school. She has managed to do some home schooling with the boys over the past few weeks but it hasn't always been easy. A socially distanced first morning back in school ""I was 10% worried but 90% thinking it was the right thing to do,"" says Julia, who has just dropped off her son. ""The main thing is for normality and for his mental health. He needs the interaction with his friends. He's been begging to come back,"" she says. A survey from the National Foundation for Educational Research suggested approaching half of families would keep their children at home. It expected that: 46% of parents will keep children at home 50% of parents in schools in disadvantaged areas will keep children at home 25% of teachers are likely to be absent because of health issues for themselves or their families. This video can not be played Can children catch and spread coronavirus? Jane Reid, a parent from York, said it was still not safe for her son to go back to school, saying: ""It's a definite no from me. ""Plus, the contradictory information is infuriating. I can take him to school, but can't get his hair cut."" ""How can I send them to school now, knowing it will be impossible for teachers to implement social distancing rules properly?"" asked Valerie Brooker from Haslemere in Surrey. Pupils have returned to find a different kind of classroom In other developments in England: Those shielding since lockdown began 10 weeks agowill be allowed outdoorswith a family member or to meet one other friend Groups of up to six people from different householdscan meet in parks and private gardens,as long as they remain two metres apart People can exercise outsidewith up to five othersfrom different households Domestic competitive sportwill be allowed behind closed doors Outdoor marketsand car showrooms can reopen, provided they have Covid-related measures in place People are banned from staying at another address overnight unless it is for a specified reason, such as work or attending a funeral. But they can leave their homes without needing a ""reasonable excuse"" The Association of Directors of Public Health, which represents council health figures,warned in the Guardian,externalthat restrictions were being relaxed too quickly as ""the public is not keeping to social distancing as it was"". In Wales, people from two different households can meet each other outdoors. Groups of four to six people who are not in the same household can meet outdoors in Northern Ireland. And in Scotland members of two different households are already allowed to meet outdoors.

For some parents the decision has been taken out of their hands. Lancashire County Council is among those saying it is not yet safe to open schools. A mother in Lancashire, who wanted to remain anonymous, has described this as a relief as she did not want her child to go back, although her husband did. This video can not be played A Suffolk school has built a teepee to allow social distancing The way that schools are bringing back pupils has many local variations - spread out over the next couple of weeks and with many schools making their own arrangements over which year groups return and for how many days a week. The day looked very different for those pupils who did return - with staggered drop-off times and children staying in small groups of no more than 15 pupils. Ministers say opening schools will help with childcare for parents returning to work - and to help children catch up with missed lessons. Protesters outside the Department for Education warned that opening schools was not safe From 15 June secondary pupils will start to return, in Years 10 and 12 - and there are plans for all primary years to go back for the last month of term. Teachers' unions unconvinced by school safety plans 'Virus could be here for a year', so schools must reopen Nurseries and early years' providers are also opening, and a survey of 4,500 parents with young children, carried out by the Early Years Alliance, indicated a divided picture on take-up. 65% of nurseries and childcare settings open from 1 June 45% of parents planning to take up places The biggest reason for parents not sending in their children was concern about safety. Chief executive Neil Leitch warned the row over the prime minister's adviserDominic Cummings travelling during lockdownthreatened to undermine parents' trust on safety measures. A school in Tamworth with pupils back in class The concern was echoed by the Royal Society of Arts which published a survey of more than 2,000 adults in the UK showing 49% think the government is too caught up in the ""Dominic Cummings affair"" to be making the right decisions about schools. ""Despite the narrative from the government, the level of confidence for a return to schools remains low,"" said Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers. Tulip Siddiq, Labour's shadow minister for children and early years, said the lower demand for childcare places would put nurseries under ""extraordinary financial pressure"" and  ""millions of childcare places could be lost in this crisis"".

The islands that halted an outbreak by locking down early,"Early in the Covid-19 outbreak, the Shetland Islands were one of the worst-hit areas of the UK by head of population. Now, no new cases have been detected there for six weeks. Some experts say it offers the rest of the country a route map out of lockdown - but for the first family on the islands to test positive, it hasn't been easy. It was a clear, bright Tuesday in early March when the plane began its descent. The Shetland archipelago stretched out ahead of the tiny twin-propeller aircraft. Iain Malcolmson looked through his passenger-seat window at the sprawl of islands, aware of how far north he'd just travelled. Iain, 53, an architect, was on his way home. He and his wife, Suzanne, had spent a long weekend in the Italian city of Naples with four friends. They'd hesitated before setting off on 28 February - news bulletins were full of alarming footage of the Covid-19 cluster in Lombardy, 500 miles to the north of where they were staying. But official travel advice at that point was clear - it was safe to visit the south of the country - so they'd gone as planned. All the same, Iain recalled spending the trip fastidiously wiping down restaurant tables and washing his hands. Now, after an overnight stop in Edinburgh, Iain would soon be back at the house in the tiny settlement of Nesting, about 12 miles north of the islands' capital, Lerwick. Locals call this leg of the journey the ""white-knuckle express""; in strong winds, the plane has to take off and land at Sumburgh Airport sideways, like a crab. Normally, Iain preferred the 14-hour overnight ferry from Aberdeen. But on this occasion everything seemed calm. During the first week of March 2020, the novel coronavirus pandemic that had raged out of Wuhan still seemed far away. Here in the tiny aeroplane, Scotland's mainland was 110 miles to the south, Norway was 190 miles to the east. It was still possible to conceive that Shetland might be spared. ""You have to understand what Shetland is like,"" says Iain. ""We're pretty isolated, and I think most people thought it would be something that would happen to other people. It wouldn't have come to Shetland."" Then, two days after he landed, on the evening of Thursday 5 March, Iain noticed he had a headache. FromSumburgh Head,externalin the south to Out Stack, the northernmost point in the British Isles, Shetland has 567 sq miles of land and 1,679 miles of coastline. Of its 100-odd islands, 16 are inhabited, and about half the 23,000 population, like Iain and his family, live close to Lerwick. In the summer, days are up to 19 hours long; in the winter, if you're lucky, you can see the Northern Lights. The islands were pledged to Scotland by Norway in 1468, and the Norn language - a form of Old Norse spoken on the islands - died out in the mid-19th Century. The Scandinavian influence is still strong, from the Nordic-derived placenames -Burravoe, Grutness, Mavis Grind- to the brightly coloured timber-clad houses dotted across the landscape, and the annual Up Helly Aa fire festivals, which conclude with the torching of a Viking galley. Scalloway, Shetland But despite this Shetlanders don't want the rest of Scotland to forget about them. A2018 lawintroduced by the islands' Member of the Scottish Parliament banned public bodies from producing maps that depict Shetland, for reasons of cartographical convenience, in a box in the Moray Firth or east of Orkney rather than its true geographical location. Iain was raised as a Shetlander. He left to study architecture in Edinburgh, where he met Suzanne, but two decades later, after starting a family, they decided to open a practice back on Shetland. It had been their dream for a long time. ""It's just the freedom that you have,"" he says. ""You've got family, friends and that sort of thing. It's a very friendly, positive sort of place."" He's a well-known figure in Shetland - he sits on the local community council, is a keen Up Helly Aa participant and has played guitar in local bands. The property he and Suzanne designed for their family to the dimensions of a Norse longhouse was featured on the BBC'sScotland's Home of the Yearprogramme. The Malcomson family home in Nesting, Shetland Shetland might be remote, but it is no backwater. Thanks in part to the discovery of North Sea oil in the late 20th Century, its per capita GDP is among the highest of all Scotland's local authority areas. In the 1970s, the local council drove anextraordinarily hard bargainwith the energy companies who wanted to operate the terminal at Sullum Voe. Compensation payments were invested in a charitable trust that ensures the islands have exceptionally good public services. ""The facilities up here are second to none,"" says Iain. ""Every little community has its own leisure centre or pool."" When he woke on the morning of Friday 6 March, Iain still didn't feel well. For the past two days he'd gone in to work, but now he clearly wasn't up to it. One of the friends he'd travelled to Naples with, a Glasgow resident, wasn't feeling great either and had been advised by the NHS to get tested; so Iain and Suzanne arranged to be tested too. Nurses arrived at the couple's house. They stripped off on the porch and, before stepping inside, changed into full PPE - visors, protective suits - before taking swabs from the Malcomsons' noses and the backs of their throats. ""It was like something off the telly,"" Iain says. The whole scenario was unnerving, but the staff were reassuring. ""They were saying: 'You'll be fine, the chances of you having it where you've been are almost zero. So don't worry about it.'"" He says he and Suzanne stayed indoors that weekend anyway. There was a delay while the samples were tested - Iain was told they had to be flown down to Aberdeen and then taken to Glasgow. On Sunday evening the results came through: Shetland had its first confirmed cases of Covid-19. ""Everybody was gobsmacked,"" says Iain. ""And it all kicked off from there."" At least one person on Shetland wasn't surprised by the arrival of the virus. His name is Michael Dickson. Not long before, as NHS Shetland's chief executive, he'd been summoned to the mainland for a presentation on the likely impact of the pandemic. ""I can honestly say when I came out of the government briefing, it was without a doubt the worst day of my entire career,"" he says. ""To go back to Shetland and have to share that with the people of Shetland was incredibly difficult."" Gilbert Bain hospital, Lerwick He also knew that Shetland's geographical isolation would make treating the virus there especially challenging. ""Lovely as it is,"" he says, Lerwick's Gilbert Bain Hospital ""was never built for this."" There is no intensive care unit anywhere on the islands. At that stage, any patients who became critically unwell would need to be flown to Aberdeen or elsewhere on the mainland in an enormous RAF Atlas military transport aircraft. But Shetland would have advantages, too. Standing at his front door, ""I can cast my eye out and see no-one"", he says. ""There's houses but I'm not going to see anyone walking down the street. If I go for a five-mile run I might run into three or four people. It's just a completely different place to socially distance."" Also, an outbreak of measles on the Aberdeen ferry meant NHS Shetland had very recent experience of carrying out contact tracing. ""That was hugely useful,"" he says. ""The fact is, knowing the geography of Shetland, the different communities, makes a huge difference."" This was crucial, Dickson says, after the first positive test results came in. ""When that call went out from the Public Health teams to say we need to do this now, there wasn't a debate. People came in on their Sundays and said 'Right, let's start, let's get on with this.'"" The nurses in visors and PPE suits who came to test the Malcolmsons took the names of everyone they had come in contact with and tested them too. According to Dr Susan Laidlaw, NHS Shetland's public health consultant, staff from other NHS departments were drafted in to phone contacts. ""We had a week of very long hours and intense work following up the contacts, identifying new cases and getting them tested and isolated,"" she says. ""Although difficult at the time, this did help to contain the initial outbreak."" ""Everybody at our work got it,"" Iain says. ""And everyone from our work's family ended up getting it."" Some had diarrhoea, others lost all sense of smell and taste. Others fared worse - Iain says the father of one of his employees had to be airlifted to Aberdeen. He would later make a full recovery. While the contact tracers scrambled to identify how far the virus had spread, Iain's condition was getting worse. Suzanne's symptoms were cold-like, but his were more like the flu - a high temperature, shivering. There was talk of flying Iain, too, to Aberdeen. The prospect terrified him. ""I really didn't want to go off the island,"" he says. After a few days, Iain's symptoms began to improve. But the knowledge he might have given the virus to others in less robust health weighed heavily on him. He was terrified he'd given it to his parents, both in their 80s. ""That stress was there, knowing that you could have given it to people who weren't going to be as lucky as you."" And while he'd been feeling unwell, Iain hadn't felt much like looking at social media. He hadn't yet seen the rumours about him. The virus spread quickly on Shetland. On 12 March, four days after Iain and Suzanne's test results came back, the number of confirmed cases announced in the local press rose from two to six; five days later, they stood at 15; by 19 March, they had risen again to 24. These were not enormous numbers, but they were enough to ensure that Shetland had the highest number of Covid-19 patients in Scotland relative to its population, and one of the highest in the UK. ""I think we were top of the graph possibly in the world at one point,"" says Dickson. As Dickson sees it, this early spike was, in part, testament to the efficiency of the contact tracing teams. A dedicated Covid ward had already been set aside at the hospital. But compared to Orkney and the Western Isles, which had largely been unaffected at that point, Shetland stood out - and Shetlanders were understandably anxious. Dickson believes this was a crucial factor in containing the outbreak; it meant islanders were already taking social distancing seriously before controls on movements were enforced. ""It's a difficult thing to say, but I think having those cases early on enabled us to move possibly more quickly than had we not had cases until later on in the pandemic,"" he says. ""My family live down in Brighton and if you went down to the beach there a week before the lockdown occurred you wouldn't have known anything was different. In Shetland, things have been different pretty much from day one."" As early as 11 and 12 March, two Up Helly Aa fire festivals - hugely important events in Shetland's social calendar - were called off, in response to appeals from the health board. The following day, while the Cheltenham Gold Cup was going ahead as planned 700 miles away, it was announced that nearly all Shetland's schools would close from 16 March - a week before the rest of the country. Cafes, bars, restaurants and leisure centres were already shutting down across the islands long before the Scottish and Westminster government imposed their lockdowns, says Maggie Sandison, chief executive of the Shetland Islands Council. ""I think there's a really strong sense of community in Shetland,"" says Sandison. Naturally, islanders were anxious to do the right thing by their neighbours. But also, because such a high proportion of the population knew each other, ""people were aware that they may have come into contact with somebody who then became a positive case"" - and this in turn meant they knew to self-isolate. Sandison says the early decision to close schools was taken in part because some teachers had been part of the contact tracing teams and were advised to stay home after coming into face-to-face contact with people who had tested positive. On a sparsely populated group of islands, this was enough to put a strain on staffing levels. At the same time, ""there was quite heightened anxiety from parents"" some of whom were keeping their children at home already. Ferry operators also began preventing tourists and non-residents from travelling to the islands before nationwide restrictions were brought in. ""Because the transport links with the mainland were reduced early on, and the transport operators are only taking people who have essential reasons for travel, this has to some extent isolated the islands,"" says Laidlaw. A weekly Covid-19 Facebook livestream hosted by Dickson would attract as many as 600 viewers at a time. And Shetland's community spirit wasn't just about locking down and staying vigilant. When laundry staff at the hospital found they had a shortage of scrubs, a sewing pattern was posted on Facebook along with an appeal to turn any unwanted bedsheets into medical clothing. ""We had bags and bags of finished scrubs within days,"" says a personal assistant working for NHS Shetland, 38-year-old Lisa Grey, who oversaw the Shetland Scrubs project. NHS Shetland staff in colourful scrubs made by volunteers As well as bringing extra colour to the wards, superhero patterns on erstwhile children's duvet covers proved especially popular with medical staff. ""You can see it when you're flicking through Facebook - folk saying, 'If anyone needs shopping, I'm off tomorrow.' If anyone needs help, there will always be someone that'll help,"" Grey says. With the rest of Scotland and the UK soon following Shetland's example in locking down, and many other Covid-19 clusters emerging around the UK, the islands felt less like an outlier. But as March turned to April the archipelago's cases kept rising, and before long it would report its first death. Word had spread quickly around the islands that the Malcolmsons had been the first to test positive; Iain had never expected otherwise. ""One thing about Shetland is you have absolutely no anonymity,"" he says. ""People know you're the person that's brought it in."" To Iain, it was understandable, in a perverse way, when rumours about his family began to circulate on social media. Their names hadn't been officially released, and ""in the absence of fact, people just make stuff up"", he says. ""That's never going to change. There's always a few idiots out there."" As he hadn't been looking at Facebook, it was news to him when friends got in touch to say the family was ""getting a serious amount of flak"". According to the gossip, on the weekend he and his wife had been tested, ""we were everywhere - we were out on pub crawls, we were out at concerts,"" says Iain. ""That weekend we did everything in Shetland that everyone else was doing. And I don't know why, but they were totally convinced that they'd seen us there."" It was bad enough when it was confined to Facebook. Then tabloid journalists began calling the house. Iain's friends and family were feeling the pressure. They urged him to go on Facebook and correct the record. Iain really didn't want to do it. He wasn't a big social media person. What if it backfired? Might this not antagonise people further? But something needed to be said. Late one evening, Iain sat down at his computer and began typing. RISK AT WORK:How exposed is your job? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters COMPARING COUNTRIES:The pitfalls of doing so R0, FURLOUGH:The language of the outbreak RECOVERY:How long does it take to get better? ""After some of the hardest few days we have ever experienced, and it is only getting harder, it is with a heavy heart that Suzanne and I feel it is necessary to put straight some of the more vicious rumours that are circulating about us on social media in Shetland,"" he wrote. After being told they were to be tested and advised to self-isolate, ""we have not left the house since and have not been out partying, or socialising of any kind"". The response was overwhelmingly positive. The post was shared over 1,000 times; friends and neighbours backed up their account; the record was duly corrected. Iain didn't bear a grudge - this was what happened in the absence of reliable information. ""It showed you the good side and the bad side of social media."" According to National Records of Scotland (NRS), the first death of a person in Shetland with Covid-19 took place some time between 30 March and 5 April. Five more came the following week; a sixth the week after that. On 6 May, another death was announced; there have been no more since then. Tragically, five of the seven were in a single care home. Shetland has good reason to hope it has seen its last coronavirus death of the current peak. The last time a resident of the islands tested positive was 20 April - since then, the total number of confirmed cases has stood still at 54. Nine days afterwards, Dickson told Shetland's local media that the outbreak there may have ""plateaued"". ""They've obviously managed to control the virus by doing an early lockdown,"" says Hugh Pennington, emeritus professor of bacteriology at the University of Aberdeen, who has advised the Scottish and UK governments. ""Full marks to them, really. Whatever they did worked."" Shetland's isolation and lack of new cases makes it, along with Orkney, effectively ""a very small-scale New Zealand"", says Prof Pennington - and like New Zealand, he says, the islands could in theory lift their lockdowns by strictly controlling who comes and goes. But the islands' authorities are cool on the idea of a New Zealand-style quarantine. Dickson notes how many patients have to travel to Aberdeen for routine, non-Covid medical treatment: ""So are we saying those people aren't able to go to the mainland because we've closed our borders?"" It's also necessary for the fishing and oil industries for some people to have the ability to travel in and out. Lynn Johnson says her business depends on tourism It's not just winter and spring events like the Up Helly Aa festivals that have been postponed though, as a result of the lockdown. In 2020 the long summer days will pass on the islands without sheepdog trials, the accordion and fiddle festival, Shetland Wool Week. And there's no end in sight - the first fire festival of 2021 has already been cancelled. The absence of tourists is also being keenly felt. ""My business wouldn't exist without tourism,"" says Lynn Johnson, who runs the Cake Fridge tea room on a single-track road between Voe and Aith on West Shetland Mainland's northern coast. To keep it going, she needs both the lockdown to be lifted and travel to resume. ""We really, really need that spring, summer, along with the big tourism boost that our islands get, to see us through the winter. And we're not going to have that at all."" But for now, the lockdown is holding. Shetland is ready to resume contact tracing - which was halted in late March, as in the rest of the UK - and Laidlaw says the islands are well prepared for the next phase. Since late April, Shetland has had its own Covid-19 testing equipment, meaning samples no longer have to be sent to the mainland. And two small planes - like the one Iain flew back from holiday on - have been converted into air ambulances. In spite of the apparent success of Shetland's track-and-trace operation, no-one may ever know how the virus arrived there. Iain and his wife may have been the first people on Shetland to have tested positive, but that doesn't mean they were the first to bring it. ""Obviously I know about the contact tracing, the Malcomsons and their experience,"" says Dickson. ""We picked up those people who were diagnosed and got a positive result. I always say, those are the ones we know about. Shetland is a small community but we do have people who come in and out of the islands frequently."" The couple most likely travelled in with the virus, but ""what we can't guarantee is they were the only people"". And there is no guarantee the Malcolmsons caught the virus in Italy either, as it is thought to have beencirculating in Edinburgh, where they changed flights, since February. Iain knows better than most the importance of social distancing. And he knows he's fortunate to being doing so in Shetland, where keeping apart from others is easier. ""It's absolutely beautiful,"" he says. ""You feel like you're on holiday. You have to be pretty disciplined about actually working. But this could be our summer, so you have to make hay while the sun shines."" Follow@mrjonkelly,externalon Twitter Â© 2025 BBC.

'More than two million in UK wait for cancer care',"There were fewer chemotherapy and radiotherapy treatments during the epidemic About 2.4 million people in the UK are waiting for cancer screening, treatment or tests, as a result of disruption to the NHS during the past 10 weeks, according to Cancer Research UK. It estimates 2.1 million have missed out on screening, while 290,000 people with suspected symptoms have not been referred for hospital tests. More than 23,000 cancers could have gone undiagnosed during lockdown. Cancer services are starting to reopen across the UK. Cancer Research UK's figures are based on data for England and estimated for the whole of the UK. During lockdown, the health service focused on the care and treatment of patients with Covid-19, while other services, such as cancer care, were scaled back. People were still encouraged to seek medical help when they needed it - but there were fewer cancer operations and many chemotherapy and radiotherapy appointments were postponed. Screening programmes that detect early signs of bowel, breast and cervical cancer were paused in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, although not officially stopped in England. And an estimated 2.1 million people who would normally have had routine screening missed out, Cancer Research UK says. Breast screening is just one of many ways of detecting cancers 'Thousands missing out on cancer diagnosis' Cancer surgery delays risk 'thousands' of deaths Cancer patients' concern over treatment suspension The charity says urgent referrals, when patients with suspected cancer symptoms are referred to hospitals by their GP, fell by up to 75% in the first four weeks of lockdown, although these figures have since improved. Patients receiving treatments for cancer also fell, with 6,000 fewer people receiving chemotherapy and 2,800 fewer receiving radiotherapy over the past 10 weeks. And there were only 60% - 12,800 fewer - of the usual number of operations to remove tumours, Cancer Research UK estimates. Chief executive Michelle Mitchell said Covid-19 has placed an ""enormous strain on cancer services"". ""The NHS has had to make very hard decisions to balance risk,"" she said. RISK AT WORK:How exposed is your job? SCHOOLS:When are children returning? EXERCISE:What are the guidelines on getting out? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? ""And there have been some difficult discussions with patients about their safety and ability to continue treatment during this time,"" she said. ""Prompt diagnosis and treatment remain crucial to give people with cancer the greatest chances of survival and prevent the pandemic taking even more lives."" To ensure no-one is put at risk from the virus now that cancer care is returning, Cancer Research UK said ""frequent testing of NHS staff and patients, including those without symptoms"" was vital. It estimates that up to 37,000 tests for the virus would need to be carried out each day for this purpose if the NHS was back running as normal. This is happening at different speeds in the four nations of the UK, with the setting up of safe Covid-free spaces in hospitals key to addressing the backlog of patients. NHS England said coronavirus ""has turned millions of lives upside down"" but cancer services were now largely ""open, ready and able to receive all patients who need care"". Anyone concerned about cancer symptoms should contact their GP. The Welsh and Scottish governments said cancer screening programmes would resume when safe, based on clinical advice. In Northern Ireland, there are plans for urgent cancer surgery and treatment to resume, along with routine screening. Macmillan Cancer Support recently warned of a potential ""ticking cancer timebomb"" due to disrupted cancer services. It said urgent action was needed to make sure cancer does not become the forgotten 'C' during the pandemic. ""We continue to urge the government to set out exactly how it will support the NHS to rapidly rebuild cancer services, including how people will be protected from infection by ensuring there is enough staff, regular testing, plentiful supplies of PPE and... social distancing,"" Sara Bainbridge, head of policy, said.

Lottery winner hopes to realise boyhood dream,"Simon Waddup said he ""kept hearing this voice telling me to buy a lottery ticket"" before playing online An electrician who has been unable to work for a year through ill health has won Â£1m on the Euromillions lottery. Simon Waddup, 31, of Coventry, said he hoped the win meant he could realise his ""dream"" of buying and doing up old properties. He said a rare blood disorder and faulty heart valve had ""constantly held me back"". Mr Waddup added his daughter, 10, hoped the win meant she could go on holiday abroad for the first time. ""For as long as I can remember I have wanted to buy old properties, do them up and build my own portfolio,"" he said. ""Friends and family laughed at my dream, especially when I was a teenager."" He studied Design Technology, worked on building sites and trained to become an electrician with this ambition in mind. However, he said ill health had meant he had ""been in and out of hospital a lot over the last few years""  and had been unable to work since last summer. News and updates from the West Midlands Mr Waddup said he had played the Euromillions game for the first time this month and had been in ""a bit of a daze"" since the win. ""Due to coronavirus, I can't celebrate with my family and I can't wait to see people and talk about the win - I will definitely be treating my family,"" he said.

Primark says no 'special discounts' at reopening,"Primark is planning to reopen all of its 153 stores in England on 15 June when lockdown restrictions are lifted, its owner AB Foods has said. During lockdown the clothing chain has built up almost Â£2bn-worth of stock to sell, double its normal stockholding. However, bargain-hunters will be left disappointed after the firm said there would be no ""special discounting"". ""The stock will be sold in the normal course of business, albeit at a later date,"" it said. The company said it had Â£1.5bn of stock on hand plus a commitment to suppliers to buy another Â£400m-worth. It normally holds stock worth Â£900m. The excess stock mainly comprises non-fashion and non-seasonal ranges plus some excess spring-summer goods, it said. Which shops are reopening? Non-essential shops to reopen from 15 June - PM Some of the latter will be held back until spring 2021 while the rest will be sold ""in the normal course of business"". Primark's 37 shops in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales will re-open in late June pending ""further guidance"". It has also pulled forward the opening of a new store in the Trafford Centre, Manchester to 15 June. It was originally planned to open in the third quarter of the year. The company has already reopened more than 100 stores across Europe including 32 in Germany, 25 in Spain and 20 in the Netherlands. It said it had learned lessons from the openings that would be carried forward to UK openings. ""Social distancing protocols, hand sanitiser stations, perspex screens at tills and additional cleaning of high frequency touch points in the store are among the measures we are implementing,"" it said. Primark has opened stores in Europe, including this shop in Berlin Personal protection, including masks and gloves, are being made available to all employees, the company added. ""These measures are designed to safeguard the health and wellbeing of everyone in store and to instil confidence in the store environment."" It said it has received positive feedback from customers and employees in areas where stores are already open. In other retail news, Ted Baker has said it plans to raise Â£95m to slash debt and to help pay for a transformation plan. The announcement came as the fashion chain reported a loss of Â£79.9m for the year to 25 January 2020, compared to a profit of Â£30.7m the previous year. The fashion brand blamed the loss on Â£84.6m of non-underlying expenses, including Â£45.8m of inventory charges after an investigation found that it hadoverstated the value of its stock. In the 14 weeks since January, to 2 May, revenue has slumped 36%, although online sales have jumped by 50%. To turn things around the retailer has announced a new strategy it calls ""Ted's Growth Formula"", which will involve ""stabilising the foundations, driving growth, and enhancing operational excellence"". Ted Baker has started to gradually reopen stores, primarily in Europe, and is planning for further re-openings as governments relax lockdown rules.

Holiday firms in fresh plea over flight quarantine,"A group of 200 travel companies has written to Home Secretary Priti Patel asking for current quarantine plans for people entering the UK to be scrapped. It follows calls last week from MPs and travel bosses to reconsider the rules. From 8 June, people entering the UK from abroad will be told to isolate for 14 days or face a fine. The government insists the new rules will help keep the transmission rate of the virus down. The letter suggests travel should be possible for people - without quarantine - between destinations ""deemed safe from coronavirus"". So-called air bridges would allow visitors from countries where coronavirus infection rates are low into the UK, without having to self-isolate for two weeks. Coronavirus: How safe is it to get on a plane? The lead author of the letter, George Morgan-Grenville, boss of tour operator Red Savannah, said: ""This is not just a group of company bosses complaining, but employees from bottom to top calling for the quarantine plans to be quashed."" A government spokesperson said: ""These cross Government public health measures are designed to keep the transmission rate down, stop new cases being brought in from abroad and help prevent a devastating second wave of coronavirus. All of our decisions have been based on the latest scientific evidence. The quarantine hasn't even taken effect, but from the word go, this policy has been under fire on several fronts. Travel firms face bankruptcy. It could be the final nail in the coffin for some smaller firms. UK aviation is shedding jobs and if the sector can't rebound to some extent this summer, the economic misery will only be compounded. Senior figures within the Conservative party, like the former shadow home secretary David Davis, are vehemently opposed. I'm told that the Transport Secretary, Grant Shapps, is not a fan either. But Number 10 and the Home Office argue that as the prevalence of the virus falls in the UK, the effectiveness of a quarantine, to stop cases being imported, rises. ""Air bridges"" - where two countries with relatively low infection rates agree to waive the quarantine measures - are possible. Reports in the Portuguese media suggest an air bridge with Portugal is on the cards. But when it comes to controlling the virus, the United Kingdom is behind other countries in Europe and so, in negotiations, the ball might not be in the UK's court. The quarantine might prove irrelevant in some cases if governments such as those in Greece and Spain, as they have indicated, do not let British tourists in. Other firms and travel bosses who have signed include hotelier Sir Rocco Forte, hotels The Ritz, The Connaught and Mandarin Oriental, and upmarket travel agent Kuoni. Last month, in a letter to the prime minister, bosses of airlines such as EasyJet, Tui, Jet2 and Virgin Atlantic, as well as industry bodies Airlines UK, the British Chambers of Commerce, UK Hospitality and manufacturing association Make UK said that while they fully support the government's commitment to public health, they have ""serious reservations"" about a ""blanket approach"" to all arrivals into Britain. Some travel firms have come under fire for their treatment of customers owed refunds as flights and holidays were cancelled amid the UK's lockdown. The aviation watchdog last month warned airlines that they are legally required to provide refunds to customers who had their flights cancelled because of the coronavirus. By law, plane operators must refund customers within seven days if their flight is cancelled. The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) said it could take action against airlines. Airlines including Easyjet, British Airways, Virgin Atlantic and Ryanair have all announced thousands of job cuts. Passengers arriving in the UK by plane, ferry or train - including UK nationals - will have to provide an address where they will remain for 14 days. There is a Â£100 penalty for anyone found to have not filled in this ''contact locator'' form. Surprise visits will be used to check they are following the rules. Those in England could be fined up to Â£1,000 if they fail to self-isolate, while governments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland can also impose penalties. Passengers will be asked to drive in their own car to their destination, where possible. If they do not provide an address, the government will arrange accommodation. They must then not go to work, school, or public areas, or use public transport or taxis. They should also not have any visitors unless they are providing essential support, and should not go out to buy food or other essentials where they can rely on others. The Home Office added: ""The list of exemptions has been agreed by all government departments in consultation with their stakeholders which will ensure critical supplies and services can continue and will be kept under review. ""People coming into the UK will be required to provide contact and travel information, including those who are exempt. We will set out further detail shortly including on how we will take action against those who flout the rules."" VACCINE:How close are we to finding one? SCHOOLS:When will children be returning?

Primary pupils return but some families stay home,"Parents bringing their children back to school on Monday in Norfolk Head teachers are reporting ""highly variable"" levels of attendance, ranging from 40% to 70%, as primary schools in England bring back more pupils. Geoff Barton, leader of the ASCL heads' union, says the return has been ""very mixed"" - with some schools not yet open and some children staying away. Children in Reception, Years 1 and 6 are the first groups able to return. It comes as lockdown measures are eased in England, including groups of six people being allowed to meet outside. Schools have remained open throughout the coronavirus restrictions for the children of key workers and vulnerable children - but from Monday more than two million more pupils have been invited back. Latest government figures show 39,045 people with the virus have died in the UK, across all settings. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said there had been a day-on-day increase of 111 deaths and 1,570 new positive tests. An additional 445 deaths have been added to the overall death toll in the past day. The increase is explained by the retrospective inclusion of some patients whose tests were carried out by commercial partners, rather than the NHS or Public Health England. The first wave of primary school pupils has returned to school The head teachers' leader says the ""first impression"" has been of a very varied local picture - with not all schools either open or bringing back pupils as outlined in the government's plans. Some local authorities have not yet started to bring back more pupils, some schools have limited space, some are still training and not all staff are available, he said. ""Caution is the watchword, and everybody is approaching this task with the safety of pupils and staff as their absolute priority,"" said Mr Barton. Live: England goes back to school In pictures: the first day back at school Which children will be going back to school? How could all children fit in school with 15 pupils per classroom? A survey from the National Foundation for Educational Research suggested almost 50% of children would be kept at home by parents. Mr Barton's early feedback suggests ranges of between 30% and 60% of pupils not attending school. Social distancing markers have been added to school life But he said more key workers' children seemed to be coming in and he expected the overall numbers to increase as ""more parents become confident"". The biggest teachers' union, the National Education Union, has warned it was not yet safe to open schools - and the union's co-leader, Kevin Courtney, said delaying the wider opening of schools would ""make our communities safer"". Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said children needed to catch up with missed lessons and at school they ""will be with their teachers and friends again"". ""I'm excited to see my friends and see everyone but not excited for the work,"" says 11-year-old Sean, returning to school in Mortlake, West London. BBC News education reporter Judith Burns describes the return to school: ""You look like you've grown,"" says teacher Catherine Hughes to a reception pupil who hasn't been in school since March. Pupils have to learn a new way of behaving at school ""Are you excited to be back?"" Helen Frostick head of St Mary Magdalen's Catholic primary school in Mortlake, West London asks another. About half of those who could have returned have taken up their places, alongside 15 children of key workers who have continued to come into school throughout the lockdown. The classrooms have been completely reorganised, with desks in rows, facing forwards, instead of pushed together into big tables. Parents say goodbye for the first Monday morning back in 10 weeks There's lots of hand washing and the windows are open to let in fresh air. The school has split each class into two separate bubbles with one half in on Monday and Tuesday and the other on Thursday and Friday, which allows for a deep clean on Wednesdays. In the Reception class each table is separate, with its own tray of equipment so that the children don't need to get out of their seats so much, says teaching assistant, Clare Gordon. ""It really is best for the family,"" says mum Sophia as she brings her two sons to school. She has managed to do some home schooling with the boys over the past few weeks but it hasn't always been easy. A socially distanced first morning back in school ""I was 10% worried but 90% thinking it was the right thing to do,"" says Julia, who has just dropped off her son. ""The main thing is for normality and for his mental health. He needs the interaction with his friends. He's been begging to come back,"" she says. A survey from the National Foundation for Educational Research suggested approaching half of families would keep their children at home. It expected that: 46% of parents will keep children at home 50% of parents in schools in disadvantaged areas will keep children at home 25% of teachers are likely to be absent because of health issues for themselves or their families. This video can not be played Can children catch and spread coronavirus? Jane Reid, a parent from York, said it was still not safe for her son to go back to school, saying: ""It's a definite no from me. ""Plus, the contradictory information is infuriating. I can take him to school, but can't get his hair cut."" ""How can I send them to school now, knowing it will be impossible for teachers to implement social distancing rules properly?"" asked Valerie Brooker from Haslemere in Surrey. Pupils have returned to find a different kind of classroom In other developments in England: Those shielding since lockdown began 10 weeks agowill be allowed outdoorswith a family member or to meet one other friend Groups of up to six people from different householdscan meet in parks and private gardens,as long as they remain two metres apart People can exercise outsidewith up to five othersfrom different households Domestic competitive sportwill be allowed behind closed doors Outdoor marketsand car showrooms can reopen, provided they have Covid-related measures in place People are banned from staying at another address overnight unless it is for a specified reason, such as work or attending a funeral. But they can leave their homes without needing a ""reasonable excuse"" The Association of Directors of Public Health, which represents council health figures,warned in the Guardian,externalthat restrictions were being relaxed too quickly as ""the public is not keeping to social distancing as it was"". In Wales, people from two different households can meet each other outdoors. Groups of four to six people who are not in the same household can meet outdoors in Northern Ireland. And in Scotland members of two different households are already allowed to meet outdoors.

For some parents the decision has been taken out of their hands. Lancashire County Council is among those saying it is not yet safe to open schools. A mother in Lancashire, who wanted to remain anonymous, has described this as a relief as she did not want her child to go back, although her husband did. This video can not be played A Suffolk school has built a teepee to allow social distancing The way that schools are bringing back pupils has many local variations - spread out over the next couple of weeks and with many schools making their own arrangements over which year groups return and for how many days a week. The day looked very different for those pupils who did return - with staggered drop-off times and children staying in small groups of no more than 15 pupils. Ministers say opening schools will help with childcare for parents returning to work - and to help children catch up with missed lessons. Protesters outside the Department for Education warned that opening schools was not safe From 15 June secondary pupils will start to return, in Years 10 and 12 - and there are plans for all primary years to go back for the last month of term. Teachers' unions unconvinced by school safety plans 'Virus could be here for a year', so schools must reopen Nurseries and early years' providers are also opening, and a survey of 4,500 parents with young children, carried out by the Early Years Alliance, indicated a divided picture on take-up. 65% of nurseries and childcare settings open from 1 June 45% of parents planning to take up places The biggest reason for parents not sending in their children was concern about safety. Chief executive Neil Leitch warned the row over the prime minister's adviserDominic Cummings travelling during lockdownthreatened to undermine parents' trust on safety measures. A school in Tamworth with pupils back in class The concern was echoed by the Royal Society of Arts which published a survey of more than 2,000 adults in the UK showing 49% think the government is too caught up in the ""Dominic Cummings affair"" to be making the right decisions about schools. ""Despite the narrative from the government, the level of confidence for a return to schools remains low,"" said Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers. Tulip Siddiq, Labour's shadow minister for children and early years, said the lower demand for childcare places would put nurseries under ""extraordinary financial pressure"" and  ""millions of childcare places could be lost in this crisis"".

LiveCoronavirus in England: Schools reopen,"Some primary schools in England have reopened after 10 weeks but a number of schools have stayed shut Children in Reception, Years 1 and 6 are able to return but attendance is not compulsory A survey says half of parents are still wary about coronavirus and are not sending their children in Schools have staggered drop-off and pick up times and children will stay in small groups of no more than 15 pupils Updates on Monday 1 June Rob England and David Cosgrove Rob EnglandBBC News That's all from our live updates on the day England's primary schools started to reopen. We'll be back tomorrow morning from 07:30 BST with more coronavirus news and updates from around the country. Thanks for joining us, and have a good evening. Rob EnglandBBC News Darren Styne said he and his partner changed their minds and decided to not send their son back to school due to concerns about social distancing guidelines. ""Part
of the problem, for me, was that he couldn't play with the other children, and
would be expected to sit by himself, two metres apart from another child,"" Mr Styne, from Derbyshire, said. ""You canât tell a kid not to go play with their friends."" Mr Styne said he considered the school's advice to be ""spot on"", but a letter saying that children breaking social distancing measures repeatedly could be excluded made him ""uncomfortable"". ""We would feel better if we had inclusive groups of four or five kids that they could interact with. I feel like it will be [like that] after the summer holidays, so in September we will review sending him back to school."" David PittamBBC News Online Outside Chellaston Infant School earlier, Gurpreet Dhinsa told me he had no concerns about his children Jeevan, 6, and Nirvar, 5, returning. ""I wasn't at all worried about them going back,"" he said. ""No-one in the family is vulnerable. ""The kids were getting sick and tired of the same surroundings. ""The government has scientific backing for it, we need to start thinking about a route to some normality otherwise we'll be stuck in a rut for months or years.""  Rob EnglandBBC News Throughout the day we've been looking at the return of some primary school pupils to schools across England. But what about the students who haven't really left school? Key worker Sam, from Amesbury, Wiltshire, whose daughters are five and eight, says they have been going into school as normal since they closed to most. He and his wife are both key workers - Sam is a plumbing and heating engineer, and his wife is a dispenser in a pharmacy. ""Key workers haven't had the choice about sending children to school as we've had to go to work,"" he said. ""Whilst non key worker parents have a choice, there will always be some who won't send them. ""But with that attitude they won't ever send them back as there are always dangers."" Sam continued: ""Our school has been amazing and we've had no concerns around safety. The children play in their bubbles whilst maintaining social distancing. ""Our five-year-old has no problem with social distancing and finds it second nature just like the teachers now."" Rob EnglandBBC News Elizabeth Kundu, who lives near Selby in North Yorkshire, says she won't be sending her daughter, who is in Year 1, back to school this week. ""I personally donât think itâs safe,"" she said. Her main concern is the national infection rate, which she says is not low enough to make her feel comfortable with the move. ""Some people have to send their kids back to school and they are doing so with a lot of anxiety,"" Ms Kundu said. ""I am not going to send them back until I can see a testing and tracing system in place that is working. ""Once testing doesnât take so long and we know a true regional picture, then I will be happy to send them back."" David PittamBBC News Online After a long day of mixed emotions, Chellaston Junior School pupils left for the day. Jude Smith, 42, mother of Frankie, in Year 6, and Tallulah, in Year 4, said: ""I was in two minds about
sending them back, I was worried about the social distancing. ""But the school has been brilliant, they've addressed
all my concerns."" Frankie added: ""It was really exciting going back. I was a bit nervous at first but happy now I'm here."" Parent bringing their children back to school on Monday in Norfolk Head teachers are reporting ""highly variable"" levels of attendance, ranging from 40% to 70%,as primary schools in England bring back more pupils. Children in Reception, Years 1 and 6 are the first groups able to return. Geoff Barton, leader of the ASCL heads' union, says the return has been ""very mixed"" - with some schools not yet open and some children staying away. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said children needed to catch up with missed lessons and at school they ""will be with their teachers and friends again"". Rob EnglandBBC News Lynn
Sanders, a retired teacher from Guildford who now works as a supply teacher, says she has declined returning to work for health reasons. ""The reality of the job is that it is a very difficult thing
to social distance for small children,"" she said. ""I have a partner who is diabetic and coming up for 70, so he is high risk. I had to make the decision whether I was available for work, and I have had to say no for health reasons."" Ms Sanders added she thought ""very few schools"" would want supply teachers at this time, with limited pupil numbers and teachers unlikely to be needing cover to go on courses. ""People who depend on supply teaching for an income will fall through the cracks,"" she said. At St Mary Magdalen's Catholic Primary School in West London, head teacher Helen Frostick has spent the last few weeks redesigning classrooms, reconfiguring timetables and totally rethinking school policy on everything from PE to uniform. For staff and students, it's the first time many of them have seen each other since March. The World at OneBBC Radio 4 England's Children's Commissioner has urged the government to support a ""summer programme"" to help older pupils catch up on missed lessons. ""We've been talking about young children going back to school today but of course most children, especially older children, will have to wait an awful lot longer - up to six months,"" Anne Longfield told the BBC's World at One. She added any programme would need to take place ""in school buildings"" but could potentially be run by staff such as social workers, instead of just teachers. Children in Reception, Years 1 and 6 have been the first groupsable to return to schools across Englandfrom today. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Primary schools will face challenges in accommodating more pupils as they reopen, a trade union boss has said. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), said the early signs were that the picture on the wider opening of primary schools across England was ""very mixed"". He added that the expected level of pupil attendance at primary schools was ""highly variable"", with head teachers reporting that the attendance ranges between 40% and 70% of the eligible pupils. Children inReception, Years 1 and 6 are able to return, with many having been out of school for 10 weeks. Mr Barton said: ""School leaders are also reporting that they are seeing an increase in the number of key worker children who are attending across all year groups. ""Schools have remained open to vulnerable and key worker children throughout the lockdown period, and as the lockdown eases, it is likely this will lead to greater demand for places."" He added: ""This will be extremely challenging for primary schools to accommodate, particularly small primary schools, in addition to bringing in the eligible year groups."" David PittamBBC News Online The 108 Year 6 pupils who returned to Chellaston Junior School today were taught across 14 classrooms. This class had 10 pupils and two unused desks - 21 members of the year group did not return today. Reopening schoolshave been advisedto reduce class sizes to 15 pupils or fewer, with children kept 2m (6ft 6in) apart wherever possible. Staggered break times, increased hand washing and less sharing of equipment have also been recommended. Daniel WainwrightBBC England Data Unit There are more than 680,000 families across England where all the children in the household are in one or more of the year groups eligible to return to school from today. According to theOffice for National Statistics,external, these families include more than one million working adults. Families have been trying to balance homeschooling and work commitments since schools closed to most pupils on 20 March. However, some parents may still choose to keep their children at home. A survey of 1,200 school leaders by the National Foundation for Educational Research suggests as many as46% of parentsmay not be willing to send their children back to class. Rob EnglandBBC News Danielle Nott, from Tyne and Wear, said she's decided to keep her son at home because it would be ""unfair"" on her daughter, who cannot go back because of capacity issues. Ms Nott's son is in nursery and her daughter is in Year 1. ""There is no sound play, carpet time or book corner for him
even if he did go,"" she said. ""I would have to drag my daughter to school to drop him off
and then take her home."" ""She is really upset; I am really struggling to get her to do her school work,"" Ms Nott added. She said her children's school were bringing students back ""in order of age"" with the youngest returning first. ""All the younger ones are just playing; at least if my daughter went back, she would be learning,"" she said. ""There is still a lot of learning that we canât do at home."" A cabinet minister has insisted the lockdown is being eased in a ""very cautious"" way as thousands of children in England began returning to school despite concerns from public health officials, unions and parents. Business Secretary Alok Sharma said he understands parents' concerns over sending their children back to class. Mr Sharma told the BBC: ""This is not a dash. These are very cautious steps that we are taking. They are phased."" He said that he ""completely"" understood that ""every parent wants to keep their child safe"", but insisted the government had taken steps to ensure schools are safe to return to as classes re-opened to children in Reception, Year 1 and Year 6 in England. Pupils at St John's Primary in Penistone, Sheffield, say they are pleased to be back at school after coronavirus lockdown restrictions were eased. St John's pupil Reuben Dachtler, 11, said he was ""excited"" to get back to school after 10 weeks away, while Lucy Raynor, 11, said she had missed her lessons and her teachers: This video can not be played Primary pupils are back in some schools across England following the lockdown, but there's a mixed picture in how they're reopening, with schools in some areas staying shut. Schools have remained open throughout the coronavirus restrictions for the children of key workers and vulnerable children - but from today many more pupils are able to return. The National Association of Headteachers has tweeted that there needs to be greater ""local flexibility"" in schools reopening, but added that it will advise the government that it is unwise and impractical to admit pupils in greater numbers, if current lockdown measures continue.

Ms Aldrich said: ""When they go in, they have designated toys and playdough with their names on it â they have to take their own water in. ""The kids have been really good at social distancing, theyâve actually done it. ""Theyâve washed their hands continually, they have one desk each...at the moment itâs working.

Rob EnglandBBC News Darren Styne said he and his partner changed their minds and decided to not send their son back to school due to concerns about social distancing guidelines. ""Part
of the problem, for me, was that he couldn't play with the other children, and

Mr Styne said he considered the school's advice to be ""spot on"", but a letter saying that children breaking social distancing measures repeatedly could be excluded made him ""uncomfortable"".

""I wasn't at all worried about them going back,"" he said. ""No-one in the family is vulnerable. ""The kids were getting sick and tired of the same surroundings. ""The government has scientific backing for it, we need to start thinking about a route to some normality otherwise we'll be stuck in a rut for months or years.""  Rob EnglandBBC News Throughout the day we've been looking at the return of some primary school pupils to schools across England. But what about the students who haven't really left school? Key worker Sam, from Amesbury, Wiltshire, whose daughters are five and eight, says they have been going into school as normal since they closed to most. He and his wife are both key workers - Sam is a plumbing and heating engineer, and his wife is a dispenser in a pharmacy. ""Key workers haven't had the choice about sending children to school as we've had to go to work,"" he said. ""Whilst non key worker parents have a choice, there will always be some who won't send them. ""But with that attitude they won't ever send them back as there are always dangers."" Sam continued: ""Our school has been amazing and we've had no concerns around safety. The children play in their bubbles whilst maintaining social distancing. ""Our five-year-old has no problem with social distancing and finds it second nature just like the teachers now."" Rob EnglandBBC News Elizabeth Kundu, who lives near Selby in North Yorkshire, says she won't be sending her daughter, who is in Year 1, back to school this week. ""I personally donât think itâs safe,"" she said. Her main concern is the national infection rate, which she says is not low enough to make her feel comfortable with the move. ""Some people have to send their kids back to school and they are doing so with a lot of anxiety,"" Ms Kundu said. ""I am not going to send them back until I can see a testing and tracing system in place that is working. ""Once testing doesnât take so long and we know a true regional picture, then I will be happy to send them back."" David PittamBBC News Online After a long day of mixed emotions, Chellaston Junior School pupils left for the day. Jude Smith, 42, mother of Frankie, in Year 6, and Tallulah, in Year 4, said: ""I was in two minds about
sending them back, I was worried about the social distancing. ""But the school has been brilliant, they've addressed
all my concerns."" Frankie added: ""It was really exciting going back. I was a bit nervous at first but happy now I'm here."" Parent bringing their children back to school on Monday in Norfolk Head teachers are reporting ""highly variable"" levels of attendance, ranging from 40% to 70%,as primary schools in England bring back more pupils. Children in Reception, Years 1 and 6 are the first groups able to return. Geoff Barton, leader of the ASCL heads' union, says the return has been ""very mixed"" - with some schools not yet open and some children staying away. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said children needed to catch up with missed lessons and at school they ""will be with their teachers and friends again"". Rob EnglandBBC News Lynn
Sanders, a retired teacher from Guildford who now works as a supply teacher, says she has declined returning to work for health reasons. ""The reality of the job is that it is a very difficult thing
to social distance for small children,"" she said. ""I have a partner who is diabetic and coming up for 70, so he is high risk. I had to make the decision whether I was available for work, and I have had to say no for health reasons."" Ms Sanders added she thought ""very few schools"" would want supply teachers at this time, with limited pupil numbers and teachers unlikely to be needing cover to go on courses. ""People who depend on supply teaching for an income will fall through the cracks,"" she said. At St Mary Magdalen's Catholic Primary School in West London, head teacher Helen Frostick has spent the last few weeks redesigning classrooms, reconfiguring timetables and totally rethinking school policy on everything from PE to uniform. For staff and students, it's the first time many of them have seen each other since March. The World at OneBBC Radio 4 England's Children's Commissioner has urged the government to support a ""summer programme"" to help older pupils catch up on missed lessons. ""We've been talking about young children going back to school today but of course most children, especially older children, will have to wait an awful lot longer - up to six months,"" Anne Longfield told the BBC's World at One. She added any programme would need to take place ""in school buildings"" but could potentially be run by staff such as social workers, instead of just teachers. Children in Reception, Years 1 and 6 have been the first groupsable to return to schools across Englandfrom today. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Primary schools will face challenges in accommodating more pupils as they reopen, a trade union boss has said. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), said the early signs were that the picture on the wider opening of primary schools across England was ""very mixed"". He added that the expected level of pupil attendance at primary schools was ""highly variable"", with head teachers reporting that the attendance ranges between 40% and 70% of the eligible pupils. Children inReception, Years 1 and 6 are able to return, with many having been out of school for 10 weeks. Mr Barton said: ""School leaders are also reporting that they are seeing an increase in the number of key worker children who are attending across all year groups. ""Schools have remained open to vulnerable and key worker children throughout the lockdown period, and as the lockdown eases, it is likely this will lead to greater demand for places."" He added: ""This will be extremely challenging for primary schools to accommodate, particularly small primary schools, in addition to bringing in the eligible year groups."" David PittamBBC News Online The 108 Year 6 pupils who returned to Chellaston Junior School today were taught across 14 classrooms. This class had 10 pupils and two unused desks - 21 members of the year group did not return today. Reopening schoolshave been advisedto reduce class sizes to 15 pupils or fewer, with children kept 2m (6ft 6in) apart wherever possible. Staggered break times, increased hand washing and less sharing of equipment have also been recommended. Daniel WainwrightBBC England Data Unit There are more than 680,000 families across England where all the children in the household are in one or more of the year groups eligible to return to school from today. According to theOffice for National Statistics,external, these families include more than one million working adults. Families have been trying to balance homeschooling and work commitments since schools closed to most pupils on 20 March. However, some parents may still choose to keep their children at home. A survey of 1,200 school leaders by the National Foundation for Educational Research suggests as many as46% of parentsmay not be willing to send their children back to class. Rob EnglandBBC News Danielle Nott, from Tyne and Wear, said she's decided to keep her son at home because it would be ""unfair"" on her daughter, who cannot go back because of capacity issues. Ms Nott's son is in nursery and her daughter is in Year 1. ""There is no sound play, carpet time or book corner for him
even if he did go,"" she said. ""I would have to drag my daughter to school to drop him off
and then take her home."" ""She is really upset; I am really struggling to get her to do her school work,"" Ms Nott added. She said her children's school were bringing students back ""in order of age"" with the youngest returning first. ""All the younger ones are just playing; at least if my daughter went back, she would be learning,"" she said. ""There is still a lot of learning that we canât do at home."" A cabinet minister has insisted the lockdown is being eased in a ""very cautious"" way as thousands of children in England began returning to school despite concerns from public health officials, unions and parents. Business Secretary Alok Sharma said he understands parents' concerns over sending their children back to class. Mr Sharma told the BBC: ""This is not a dash. These are very cautious steps that we are taking. They are phased."" He said that he ""completely"" understood that ""every parent wants to keep their child safe"", but insisted the government had taken steps to ensure schools are safe to return to as classes re-opened to children in Reception, Year 1 and Year 6 in England. Pupils at St John's Primary in Penistone, Sheffield, say they are pleased to be back at school after coronavirus lockdown restrictions were eased. St John's pupil Reuben Dachtler, 11, said he was ""excited"" to get back to school after 10 weeks away, while Lucy Raynor, 11, said she had missed her lessons and her teachers: This video can not be played Primary pupils are back in some schools across England following the lockdown, but there's a mixed picture in how they're reopening, with schools in some areas staying shut. Schools have remained open throughout the coronavirus restrictions for the children of key workers and vulnerable children - but from today many more pupils are able to return. The National Association of Headteachers has tweeted that there needs to be greater ""local flexibility"" in schools reopening, but added that it will advise the government that it is unwise and impractical to admit pupils in greater numbers, if current lockdown measures continue.

Primark set to reopen English stores on 15 June,"Primark is planning to reopen all of its 153 stores in England on 15 June when lockdown restrictions are lifted, its owner AB Foods has said. During lockdown the clothing chain has built up almost Â£2bn-worth of stock to sell, double its normal stockholding. However, bargain-hunters will be left disappointed after the firm said there would be no ""special discounting"". ""The stock will be sold in the normal course of business, albeit at a later date,"" it said. The company said it had Â£1.5bn of stock on hand plus a commitment to suppliers to buy another Â£400m-worth. It normally holds stock worth Â£900m. The excess stock mainly comprises non-fashion and non-seasonal ranges plus some excess spring-summer goods, it said. Which shops are reopening? Non-essential shops to reopen from 15 June - PM Some of the latter will be held back until spring 2021 while the rest will be sold ""in the normal course of business"". Primark's 37 shops in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales will re-open in late June pending ""further guidance"". It has also pulled forward the opening of a new store in the Trafford Centre, Manchester to 15 June. It was originally planned to open in the third quarter of the year. The company has already reopened more than 100 stores across Europe including 32 in Germany, 25 in Spain and 20 in the Netherlands. It said it had learned lessons from the openings that would be carried forward to UK openings. ""Social distancing protocols, hand sanitiser stations, perspex screens at tills and additional cleaning of high frequency touch points in the store are among the measures we are implementing,"" it said. Primark has opened stores in Europe, including this shop in Berlin Personal protection, including masks and gloves, are being made available to all employees, the company added. ""These measures are designed to safeguard the health and wellbeing of everyone in store and to instil confidence in the store environment."" It said it has received positive feedback from customers and employees in areas where stores are already open. In other retail news, Ted Baker has said it plans to raise Â£95m to slash debt and to help pay for a transformation plan. The announcement came as the fashion chain reported a loss of Â£79.9m for the year to 25 January 2020, compared to a profit of Â£30.7m the previous year. The fashion brand blamed the loss on Â£84.6m of non-underlying expenses, including Â£45.8m of inventory charges after an investigation found that it hadoverstated the value of its stock. In the 14 weeks since January, to 2 May, revenue has slumped 36%, although online sales have jumped by 50%. To turn things around the retailer has announced a new strategy it calls ""Ted's Growth Formula"", which will involve ""stabilising the foundations, driving growth, and enhancing operational excellence"".

Violence erupts across US on sixth day of protestsProtesters defy curfew in cities across the US after the death of a black man at the hands of police.US & Canada,"This video can not be played 'This is pain right here' - Washington DC protests turn violent Violence has erupted in cities across the US on the sixth night of protests sparked by the death in police custody of African-American George Floyd. Dozens of cities imposed curfews, but many people ignored them, leading to stand-offs and clashes. Riot police faced off with protesters in New York, Chicago, Philadelphia and LA, firing tear gas and pepper bullets to try to disperse crowds. Police vehicles were set on fire and shops were looted in several cities. The country is experiencing the most widespread racial turbulence and civil unrest since the backlash to the assassination of Martin Luther King in 1968. The outpouring of anger began last Tuesday, after a video showed Mr Floyd being arrested in Minneapolis and a white police officer continuing to kneel on his neck even after he pleaded he could not breathe and fell unconscious. Live updates from around the US 'Unacceptable' attacks on reporters at Floyd protests How are African-Americans treated by the law? More than 75 cities have seen protests, with streets only days ago deserted because of coronavirus full of demonstrators marching shoulder to shoulder. Some US officials have warned of protest-connected virus outbreaks. The Floyd case has reignited deep-seated anger over police killings of black Americans and racism. It follows the high-profile cases of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Eric Garner in New York and others that have driven the Black Lives Matter movement. For many, the outrage also reflects years of frustration over socio-economic inequality and discrimination,not least in Minneapolis itself, where George Floyd died. About 16,000 troops from the National Guard - the US reserve military force for domestic emergencies - have been deployed to deal with the unrest across 24 states and Washington, DC, where crowds once again gathered near the White House on Sunday night. Demonstrators lit fire to buildings there, including a historic church known as the church of the presidents, and threw stones at riot officers. Police used tear gas in response. In Louisville, Kentucky, a man was shot dead in a confrontation between protesters, police and the National Guard after midnight. Shots were fired at police officers and guard troops as they moved to disperse a crowd in a car park and they ""returned fire"", leaving one man dead, Louisville Metro Police said. As on Friday and Saturday, demonstrations that had been peaceful during the day again descended into violence as night fell. Police vehicles were vandalised and set alight in several cities, while riot officers continued to respond with tear gas and flash grenades. Stores were looted in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania At least 4,400 people have been arrested in several days of protests, according to the Associated Press news agency, for offences including blocking motorways, looting and breaking curfew. On Monday, President Trump told state governors  in a videoconference that they looked ""weak"",according to leaked audio obtained by CBS,external. ""You have to dominate, if you don't dominate you're wasting your time,"" the president reportedly said.

Protesters reportedly threw bottles at riot officers in Boston before torching a police cruiser In Minneapolis, a lorry driver was arrested after reportedly breaching a road barrier before speeding towards a crowd of protesters marching along a major motorway. The driver was taken to hospital with minor injuries and later to the county jail. There were no immediate reports of other casualties. Minnesota's Governor Tim Walz said the motive of the driver was unclear, adding: ""To not have tragedy and many deaths is simply an amazing thing.""

For three years, Donald Trump presided over a nation of relative peace and prosperity. The crises he faced were largely of his own making, and he confronted them by rallying his supporters and condemning his opponents. Now Trump faces a situation ill-suited to a playbook of division. The US economy has been hobbled by a deadly pandemic. George Floyd's death at the hands of a Minneapolis police officer has spread racial unrest across the nation. The public is uncertain and afraid - and increasingly angry. These are circumstances that would test the abilities of even the most skilful leaders. This president, however, risks becoming lost at sea. His public calls for unity and healing have been undermined by a penchant for Twitter name-calling and bellicosity. Message discipline, a valuable attribute at this moment, is not his forte. There may be no easy way to guide the nation through its current peril. Barack Obama's measured coolness did nothing to stop the fires of Ferguson any more than Richard Nixon's law-and-order edicts quelled Vietnam-era unrest. The economic and social devastation of the pandemic has created a political landscape of dry brush ignited by the lightning strike of Floyd's death. The president may not be able to contain the wildfire, even if he isn't feeding the flames. Terrence Floyd, George's younger brother, told ABC News,externalhe condemned the violent protests, saying his brother stood for peace. ""I'm outraged too,"" he said. ""Sometimes I get angry... I want to go crazy. My brother wasn't about that. My brother was about peace. You'll hear a lot of people saying: 'He was a gentle giant.' Why do some protests turn violent? The last 30 minutes of George Floyd's life ""I just had to come down here to speak to people, and let people know, just channel your anger elsewhere. Don't tear up your town."" This video can not be played ""It's like we're re-living the same movie"": How black British people feel about George Floyd's death On the evening of 25 May, police were called to a grocery store where George Floyd had allegedly paid for cigarettes with a counterfeit $20 note. They found him in his car outside and tried to put him in a police vehicle, but Mr Floyd dropped to the ground, telling officers he was claustrophobic. According to police, he physically resisted and was handcuffed. Video of the incident does not clearly show what happened at that point. Bystander footage shows three police officers kneeling on the unarmed Mr Floyd, with officer Derek Chauvin's knee on his neck. Mr Floyd can be heard saying ""please, I can't breathe"" several times and ""don't kill me"" but Mr Chauvin does not remove his knee despite pleas from bystanders. A memorial to George Floyd near the spot where he died while in police custody in Minneapolis According to a preliminary autopsy, the police officer had his knee on Mr Floyd's neck for eight minutes and 46 seconds - almost three minutes of which was after Mr Floyd became non-responsive. Nearly two minutes before Mr Chauvin removed his knee the other officers checked Mr Floyd's right wrist for a pulse and were unable to find one. He was taken to hospital and pronounced dead around an hour later. Mr Chauvin, 44, has been charged with murder.

Why do protests turn violent?,"This video can not be played Protesters took to the streets again on Saturday night Curfews have been imposed in multiple cities in the US, after unrest and protests have spread across the country over the death of an unarmed black man, George Floyd, in police custody. Most of the protests began peacefully - and several stayed peaceful. But in a large number of cases, demonstrators clashed with police, set police cars on fire, vandalised property or looted shops. The National Guard has activated 5,000 of its personnel across 15 states and Washington DC. Experts have also drawn parallels with the 2011 England riots - when a peaceful protest over a man who was shot dead by police turned into four days of unrest, with widespread looting and buildings set alight. The last 30 minutes of George Floyd's life In pictures: Protests turn violent Why has a US city gone up in flames? How do protests spread so quickly - and why do some become violent? Many of the daytime protests were peaceful Incidents like Mr Floyd's death can ""become a trigger moment because it symbolises a broader experience, amongst much larger numbers of people, about the relationship between police and the black community,"" says Prof Clifford Stott, an expert in crowd behaviour and public order policing at Keele University. Confrontations are particularly likely when there are structural inequalities, he adds. Prof Stott studied the 2011 England riots extensively, and found that the riots there spread because protesters in different cities identified with each other - either because of their ethnicity, or because they shared a dislike of the police. This meant that, when the police appeared to be overwhelmed, rioters in different districts felt empowered to mobilise. England riots: Maps and timeline How one night in the riots changed my life Violent protests are less likely when police have a good relationship with the local community - but how they react to demonstrations on the day also matters, experts say. Protesters squared off against police in Los Angeles on Saturday ""Riots are a product of interactions - largely to do with the nature of the way police treats crowds,"" says Prof Stott. For example, he says, in a large crowd of protesters, tensions may begin with just a few people confronting the police. However, ""police often react towards the crowd as a whole"" - and if people feel that the police use of force against them is unjustified, this increases their ""us versus them"" mentality. This ""can change the way people feel about violence and confrontation - for example, they may start feeling that violence is legitimate given the circumstances."" Darnell Hunt, dean of social sciences at UCLA, believes police in the US ""ramped up their aggressiveness"" over the weekend. ""Deploying the National Guard, using rubber bullets, tear gas, and pepper spray - these are a range of police tactics that can exacerbate an already-tense situation."" This video can not be played Minneapolis voices: âAs a black American I am terrifiedâ It's a pattern that has been seen in other protests around the world too. For example, in 2019, Hong Kong saw seven months of anti-government protests, that began as mostly peaceful and ended up increasingly violent. Experts highlight a series of police tactics that were seen as heavy-handed - including the firing of large amounts of tear gas at young protesters - as moves that galvanised protesters and made them more confrontational. Prof Stott argues that police forces that have invested in de-escalation training are more likely to avoid violence at protests. He points to protests that were able to stay peaceful in the US over the weekend - such as in Camden, New Jersey, where officers joined the residents in a march against racism. Allow Twitter content?

Moral psychology can help explain why some protests turn violent, says Marloon Moojiman, an assistant professor in organisational behaviour at Rice University. A person's sense of morality is central to how they see themselves, so ""when we see something as immoral, it creates strong feelings, because we feel our understanding of morality has to be protected"". ""This can override other concerns people have about keeping peace"", because ""if you think the system is broken, you're going to want to really do something drastic to show that that's not acceptable."" This can apply to a wide range of beliefs - for example, in an extreme case, someone who thinks abortion is a moral outrage may be more likely to say it's OK to bomb an abortion clinic, he says. Research suggests that social media echo chambers could also make people more susceptible to endorsing violence, if they believe that their peers have the same moral views as them, he adds. In the US, hundreds of businesses have been damaged, and there has been widespread looting in LA and Minneapolis over the weekend. However, Prof Stott warns that while it's easy to assume that riots and crowds are ""irrational and chaotic, none of that is true - it's highly structured and meaningful for the people taking part"". ""To some extent, looting is an expression of power - black citizens may have felt disempowered in relation to the police - but in the context of a riot, the rioters momentarily become more powerful than the police."" Studies of previous riots show that places that get looted are often related to big businesses, and that looting ""often relates to the sense of inequality related to living in capitalistic economies"", he says. An Apple Store in Los Angeles was among those looted Prof Hunt has studied the 1992 Los Angeles riots, which were sparked after four white police officers were acquitted over the videotaped beating of black motorist Rodney King. He says there is ""a long history of targeting, or selectivity"", in vandalism and looting. ""In the LA uprisings, you'd often see 'minority owned' spray painted on minority businesses, so that people would bypass those."" However, both Prof Stott and Prof Hunt caution that looting is complicated - especially as lots of people with different motivations take part, including people in poverty, or organised criminals. The idea that violent protests are targeted and meaningful events to those taking part can also explain why looting occurs in some protests, but not others. This video can not be played How Hong Kong got trapped in a cycle of violence In Hong Kong, for example, protesters smashed shop windows, threw petrol bombs at police, and defaced the national emblem - but there was no looting. All the context you need on Hong Kong's protests Hong Kong's year in seven intense emotions Young, radical and ready for tear gas Lawrence Ho, a specialist in policing and public order management at the Education University of Hong Kong, believes this is because those protests were triggered by political developments and anger at the police, rather than discrimination and social inequality. ""Vandalism was targeted at stores seen to have a strong connection to mainland China,"" says Dr Ho. ""It was a deliberate attempt to convey a message."" Public order experts say that for the police, being seen as legitimate and able to engage protesters in dialogue is key. ""Good policing tries to avoid an 'us' and 'them' mentality, and also tries to avoid the sense that police can act in ways that people see as illegitimate,"" says Prof Stott. Police cars, including in New York, were set on fire Dr Ho also believes that negotiation is the best way - but points out that ""one of the hardest things today is that a lot of protests are leaderless. If you can't find the leader, you can't negotiate with them."" More generally, he adds, politicians can make matters better - or worse - based on their approach to dialogue, and whether they use emergency legislation. Ultimately, however, riots can be a symptom of deep-seated tensions and complicated issues that don't have an easy solution. Prof Hunt says this week's US riots are the most serious ones since 1968 - after Martin Luther King was assassinated. ""You can't think about police brutality, and the profiling of certain communities, without thinking about the inequalities that exist in society and fuel those concerns,"" he says. ""The George Floyd case was not the cause - it's more like the straw that broke the camel's back. You could argue even the police killings are symptoms - the underlying cause is white supremacy, racism, and things the US has not fundamentally dealt with."" âAs a black American I am terrifiedâ Video, 00:03:41âAs a black American I am terrifiedâ In pictures: Protest clashes in Minneapolis The last 30 minutes of George Floyd's life Winds to continue to whip up 'chaotic' fires as sheriff warns death toll could rise Climate 'whiplash' linked to raging LA fires Watch: The moment five US presidents gather at Jimmy Carter's funeral The Papers: 'Lost Angeles' and 'Musk seeks plan to oust Starmer' The 20 child abuse inquiry proposals - what has happened so far?

George Floyd's last minutes,"George Floyd repeatedly told the police officers who detained him that he could not breathe The US has been convulsed by nationwide protests over the death of an African-American man in police custody. George Floyd, 46, died after being arrested by police outside a shop in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Footage of the arrest on 25 May shows a white police officer, Derek Chauvin, kneeling on Mr Floyd's neck while he was pinned to the floor. Mr Chauvin, 44, has since been charged with murder. Transcripts of police bodycam footage show Mr Floyd said more than 20 times he could not breathe as he was restrained by the officers. The key events that led to Mr Floyd's death happened within just 30 minutes. Based on accounts from witnesses, video footage and official statements, here's what we know so far. It began with a report of a fake $20 (Â£16.20) bill. A report was made on the evening of 25 May, when Mr Floyd bought a pack of cigarettes from Cup Foods, a grocery store. Believing the $20 bill he used to be counterfeit, a store employee reported it to police. Mr Floyd had been living in Minneapolis for several years after moving there from his native Houston, Texas. He had recently been working as a bouncer in the city but, like millions of other Americans, was left jobless by the coronavirus pandemic. In pictures: Unrest spreads across US Why has a US city gone up in flames? Mr Floyd was a regular at Cup Foods. He was a friendly face, a pleasant customer who never caused any trouble,the store owner Mike Abumayyaleh told NBC,external. But Mr Abumayyaleh was not at work on the day of the incident. In reporting the suspicious bill, his teenage employee was just following protocol. In a call to 911, made at 20:01, the employee told the operator he had demanded the cigarettes back but ""he [Floyd] doesn't want to do that"",according to a transcript released by authorities,external. The employee said the man appeared ""drunk"" and ""not in control of himself"", the transcript says. Shortly after the call, at around 20:08, two police officers arrived. Mr Floyd was sitting with two other people in a car parked around the corner. After approaching the car, one of the officers, Thomas Lane, pulled out his gun and ordered Mr Floyd to show his hands.In an account of the incident,external, prosecutors do not explain why Mr Lane thought it necessary to draw his gun. Mr Lane, prosecutors said, ""put his hands on Mr Floyd, and pulled him out of the car"". Then Mr Floyd ""actively resisted being handcuffed"". Once handcuffed, though, Mr Floyd became compliant while Mr Lane explained he was being arrested for ""passing counterfeit currency"". Court transcripts from police body cameras show Mr Floyd appears co-operative at the beginning of the arrest, repeatedly apologising to the officers after they approach his parked car. Mr Lane asks Mr Floyd to show his hands at least 10 times before ordering him to get out of the vehicle. It was when officers tried to put Mr Floyd in their squad car that a struggle ensued. This video can not be played Minnesota governor on George Floyd death: 'Thank God a young person had a camera to video it' At about 20:14, Mr Floyd ""stiffened up, fell to the ground, and told the officers he was claustrophobic"", according to the report. Mr Chauvin arrived at the scene. He and other officers were involved in a further attempt to put Mr Floyd in the police car. During this attempt, at 20:19, Mr Chauvin pulled Mr Floyd away from the passenger side, causing him to fall to the ground, the report said. He lay there, face down, still in handcuffs. That's when witnesses started to film Mr Floyd, who appeared to be in a distressed state. These moments, captured on multiple mobile phones and shared widely on social media, would prove to be Mr Floyd's last. Twitter hides Trump tweet for 'glorifying violence' Mr Floyd was restrained by officers, while Mr Chauvin placed his left knee between his head and neck. For more than nine minutes, Mr Chauvin kept his knee on Mr Floyd's neck, the prosecutors say. The duration was initially given as eight minutes and 46 seconds but Minnesota prosecutors have since revised the time. The transcripts of bodycam footage from officers Lane and J Alexander Kueng show Mr Floyd said more than 20 times he could not breathe as he was restrained. He was also pleading for his mother and begging ""please, please, please"". At one point, Mr Floyd gasps: ""You're going to kill me, man."" Derek Chauvin is charged with second degree murder Officer Chauvin replies: ""Then stop talking, stop yelling. It takes heck of a lot of oxygen to talk."" Mr Floyd says: ""Can't believe this, man. Mom, love you. Love you. Tell my kids I love them. I'm dead."" A female bystander told the police: ""His nose is bleeding, come on now."" About six minutes into that period, Mr Floyd became non-responsive. In videos of the incident, this was when Mr Floyd fell silent, as bystanders urged the officers to check his pulse. Officer Kueng did just that, checking Mr Floyd's right wrist, but ""couldn't find one"". Yet the other officers did not move. At 20:27, Mr Chauvin removed his knee from Mr Floyd's neck. Motionless, Mr Floyd was rolled on to a gurney and taken to the Hennepin County Medical Center in an ambulance. He was pronounced dead about an hour later. This video can not be played In June Panorama spoke to local people to piece together the moments leading up to George Floyd's death On the night before his death, Mr Floyd had spoken to one of his closest friends, Christopher Harris. He had advised Mr Floyd to contact a temporary jobs agency. Forgery, he said, was out of character for Mr Floyd. ""The way he died was senseless,"" Harris said. ""He begged for his life. He pleaded for his life. When you try so hard to put faith in this system, a system that you know isn't designed for you, when you constantly seek justice by lawful means and you can't get it, you begin to take the law into your own hands."" 25 May 2020 George Floyd dies after being arrested by police outside a shop in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Footage shows a white officer, Derek Chauvin, kneeling on Mr Floydâs neck for several minutes while he is pinned to the floor. Mr Floyd is heard repeatedly saying ""I canât breathe"". He is pronounced dead later in hospital. 26 May Four officers involved in the arrest of George Floyd are fired. Protests begin as the video of the arrest is shared widely on social media. Hundreds of demonstrators take to the streets of Minneapolis and vandalise police cars and the police station with graffiti. 27 May Protests spread to other cities including Memphis and Los Angeles. In some places, like Portland, Oregon, protesters lie in the road, chanting ""I canât breathe"". Demonstrators again gather around the police station in Minneapolis where the officers involved in George Floydâs arrest were based and set fire to it. The building is evacuated and police retreat. 28 May President Trump blames the violence on a lack of leadership in Minneapolis and threatens to send in the National Guard in a tweet. Â He follows it up in a second tweet with a warning ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts"". The second tweet is hidden by Twitter for ""glorifying violence"". 29 May A CNN reporter, Omar Jimenez, is arrested while covering the Minneapolis protest. Mr Jimenez was reporting live when police officers handcuffed him. A few minutes later several of his colleagues are also arrested. They are all later released once they are confirmed to be members of the media. Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, 44, is charged with murder and manslaughter. The charges carry a combined maximum 35-year sentence. 31 May Violence spreads across the US on the sixth night of protests. A total of at least five people are reported killed in protests from Indianapolis to Chicago. More than 75 cities have seen protests. At least 4,400 people have been arrested. Â Curfews are imposed across the US to try to stem the unrest. 1 June President Trump threatens to send in the military to quell growing civil unrest. He says if cities and states fail to control the protests and ""defend their residents"" he will deploy the army and ""quickly solve the problem for them"". Mr Trump poses in front of a damaged church shortly after police used tear gas to disperse peaceful protesters nearby. 2 June Tens of thousands of protesters again take to the streets. One of the biggest protests is in George Floydâs hometown of Houston, Texas. Many defy curfews in several cities, but the demonstrations are largely peaceful. 4 June A memorial service for George Floyd is held in Minneapolis. Â Those gathered in tribute stand in silence for eight minutes, 46 seconds, the amount of time Mr Floyd is alleged to have been on the ground under arrest. Hundreds attended the service, which heard a eulogy from civil rights activist Rev Al Sharpton. 7 June As the US saw another weekend of protests, with tens of thousands marching in Washington DC, anti-racism demonstrations were held around the world. In Australia, there were major protests in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane that focused on the treatment of indigenous Australians. There were also demonstrations in France, Germany, Spain and the UK. In Bristol, protesters tore down the statue of a 17th century slave trader and threw it into the harbour. 9 June A funeral service for George Floyd is held in Houston, Mr Floydâs home town. Just over two weeks after his death in Minneapolis and worldwide anti-racism protests, about 500 guests invited by the Floyd family are in attendance at the Fountain of Praise Church. Â Many more gather outside to show their support. In pictures: Unrest spreads Why is a US city in flames?

Violence erupts across US on sixth day of protestsProtests continue in cities across the US sparked by the death of George Floyd at the hands of police.US & Canada,"This video can not be played 'This is pain right here' - Washington DC protests turn violent Violence has erupted in cities across the US on the sixth night of protests sparked by the death in police custody of African-American George Floyd. Dozens of cities imposed curfews, but many people ignored them, leading to stand-offs and clashes. Riot police faced off with protesters in New York, Chicago, Philadelphia and LA, firing tear gas and pepper bullets to try to disperse crowds. Police vehicles were set on fire and shops were looted in several cities. The country is experiencing the most widespread racial turbulence and civil unrest since the backlash to the assassination of Martin Luther King in 1968. The outpouring of anger began last Tuesday, after a video showed Mr Floyd being arrested in Minneapolis and a white police officer continuing to kneel on his neck even after he pleaded he could not breathe and fell unconscious. Live updates from around the US 'Unacceptable' attacks on reporters at Floyd protests How are African-Americans treated by the law? More than 75 cities have seen protests, with streets only days ago deserted because of coronavirus full of demonstrators marching shoulder to shoulder. Some US officials have warned of protest-connected virus outbreaks. The Floyd case has reignited deep-seated anger over police killings of black Americans and racism. It follows the high-profile cases of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Eric Garner in New York and others that have driven the Black Lives Matter movement. For many, the outrage also reflects years of frustration over socio-economic inequality and discrimination,not least in Minneapolis itself, where George Floyd died. About 16,000 troops from the National Guard - the US reserve military force for domestic emergencies - have been deployed to deal with the unrest across 24 states and Washington, DC, where crowds once again gathered near the White House on Sunday night. Demonstrators lit fire to buildings there, including a historic church known as the church of the presidents, and threw stones at riot officers. Police used tear gas in response. In Louisville, Kentucky, a man was shot dead in a confrontation between protesters, police and the National Guard after midnight. Shots were fired at police officers and guard troops as they moved to disperse a crowd in a car park and they ""returned fire"", leaving one man dead, Louisville Metro Police said. As on Friday and Saturday, demonstrations that had been peaceful during the day again descended into violence as night fell. Police vehicles were vandalised and set alight in several cities, while riot officers continued to respond with tear gas and flash grenades. Stores were looted in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania At least 4,400 people have been arrested in several days of protests, according to the Associated Press news agency, for offences including blocking motorways, looting and breaking curfew.

For three years, Donald Trump presided over a nation of relative peace and prosperity. The crises he faced were largely of his own making, and he confronted them by rallying his supporters and condemning his opponents. Now Trump faces a situation ill-suited to a playbook of division. The US economy has been hobbled by a deadly pandemic. George Floyd's death at the hands of a Minneapolis police officer has spread racial unrest across the nation. The public is uncertain and afraid - and increasingly angry. These are circumstances that would test the abilities of even the most skilful leaders. This president, however, risks becoming lost at sea. His public calls for unity and healing have been undermined by a penchant for Twitter name-calling and bellicosity. Message discipline, a valuable attribute at this moment, is not his forte. There may be no easy way to guide the nation through its current peril. Barack Obama's measured coolness did nothing to stop the fires of Ferguson any more than Richard Nixon's law-and-order edicts quelled Vietnam-era unrest. The economic and social devastation of the pandemic has created a political landscape of dry brush ignited by the lightning strike of Floyd's death. The president may not be able to contain the wildfire, even if he isn't feeding the flames. Terrence Floyd, George's younger brother, told ABC News,externalhe condemned the violent protests, saying his brother stood for peace. ""I'm outraged too,"" he said. ""Sometimes I get angry...

'Our business can now get cracking' after lockdownOutdoor markets and car showrooms in England are allowed to reopen from Monday amid the pandemic.,"Neil and his wife Susanne run a towel and bedding stall in Barnsley outdoor market ""It's been hard financially, but our business can now get cracking,"" says Neil Conway, who runs a towel and bedding stall at Barnsley outdoor market with his wife Susanne. Open air markets and car showrooms will be allowed to re-open in England on Monday,with coronavirus-related measures in place,external. As with garden centres (which re-opened in May across the UK), the government says the risk of transmission of Covid-19 ""is lower in these outdoor and more open spaces"". To try to keep their customers safe, Neil and Susanne have overhauled how they work. The pair have printed new signs to encourage shoppers to keep a two-metre distance, as well as introducing contactless payments and designated payment and ""pick-up"" points for orders. ""We're hoping we can provide a good example of how things can work, and hopefully others will follow,"" says Susanne. She says that it's been a ""funny few months"" not trading during lockdown, having started work at the market when she was 12-years-old. ""We have wanted to know when we were coming back, and we were questioning if it was ever going to happen."" ""But now we're really looking forward to getting started, and helping get the economy back on its feet, safety-first of course,"" she adds. Although their market stall might benefit from lockdown measures gradually being lifted, Neil anticipates it might take some time for trade  - and customer confidence - to return. ""I don't think we'll take a great deal of money at first, but we've got to get into the swing of working again,"" Neil says. When will shops open and what will the rules be? John Lewis plans phased reopening of stores Harrods hits the shopping mall to stop congestion One trade body says that those who've carried on selling essential items like food during lockdown have shown that trading can be done safely. But they told the BBC they believe only a fraction of outdoor markets will resume straight away. Joe Harrison, chief executive of the National Market Traders Federation said: ""It will take a lot of time for markets to get back to their full potential, with the correct equipment in place."" Car showrooms have also been working to put measures in place to ensure the safety of staff and customers ahead of re-opening, said Sue Robinson, director of the National Franchised Dealers Association. She said they include one-way systems, hand sanitising stations, protective screens and more frequent cleaning for each car. At Sytner, the UK's largest car dealer, customers will have to test drive cars by themselves. Boss Darren Edwards told the BBC's Today programme customers were unlikely to buy cars they had not driven, and that the firm would do ""due diligence"" to ensure it was safe. He said he was hopeful that demand would pick up from current low levels but that the future remained uncertain. ""Clearly once the government's furlough scheme finishes in October we don't know what that is going to do to the economy and general consumer confidence. That's a bit of an unknown."" Other retailers in England have also been pressing ahead with their coronavirus-secure re-opening plans. Ikea, for example, could have stayed open during lockdown. But it chose to shut, and will only re-open in England and Northern Ireland from Monday. One store manager told the BBC that ""wardens"" will be working in-store, reminding customers of social distancing guidelines. Other shops classed as non-essential in England, however, won't be able to re-open until 15 June. No firm dates have been set for the reopening of non-essential shops in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland,but each country has plans in place. This includes shopsselling things like clothes, toys, books and electronics,external, as well as tailors, auction houses, photography studios, and indoor markets. Tony Symons, owner of Roger's Menswear in Kent, has already been gearing-up to start trading again. He says that he has ordered a Perspex screen for the till area, and will introduce shorter openings hours and a cap on the number of customers allowed in his shop at one time. But like Neil the market trader, Tony only expects a trickle of trade initially. ""To be optimistic, I would say customers will come flocking through the door. Unfortunately, I don't think that will be the case."" As an independent retailer without an online sales platform, Tony is relying on customer visits, and hopes that footfall will build up over time.
